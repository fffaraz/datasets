This is the correct answer, it is essentially what I did in my script but it is easier to follow!
If you are using a desktop operating system more recent than, oh, 1995 or so, it will support multiple users and will have access controls in place so that one user, or program, does not necessarily have access to data owned by another. If the program is running on a server, then the same applies going back to the 1960s. There is a big difference between defending against the following attacks: - any user can try looking at the application's config file to see the passwords; - somebody will sit at my computer while I'm getting a coffee and try copying the password; - somebody will pull the hard drive out, take it home, and spend a week trying to break into the encrypted password store. There's no such thing as a secure system. There's only secure against *this* threat versus that one. It's perfectly reasonable to want to secure passwords against some threats, while still acknowledging that you can't defend against them taking your hard drive home and working on it for a week. For that, you rely on other countermeasures, such as people saying "Hey, why are you pulling the hard drive out of my computer? I need it!" 
python isn't a replacement for powershell or a command prompt
Edit2: I checked with reddit admins and they don't consider this to be personal information. I've put this back up and unless someone from blizzard objects, it should stay up. Hey there /u/justbrowsing21! This is a pretty interesting script, and as an avid wow player and python guy, I think it's awesome that you've chosen to do stuff with the fun and interesting API that Blizzard provides. Due to reddit's rules about finding and dispersing personal information, I have had to remove this from /r/Python (and a few places it's cropped up in /r/wow as well). I've done so because I know some GMs and I know that they are desperately careful with their personal accounts to ensure that they aren't "found out". I hope you understand the stance here; finding and dispersing personal information (even something like this that you found with a public API) is definitely a reddit no no, so I'd urge you to be careful about publishing things like this. Edit: I've un-removed this and will let someone else who doesn't have any kind of conflict make a call on it. To me it looks like a pretty text book case of exposing someone's information that they would like to keep quiet.
In theory, no. In practice, yes. Most tasks can be done in pure Python. For those that can't, there's the subprocess module, which allows me to call commands like I would from a terminal. I can still benefit from writing the meat of my logic in Python. I don't write bash scripts on OS X unless they are trivial, and if Python had the same support on Windows, then I wouldn't write batch files or PowerShell scripts, either. The more complicated the script, the more I benefit from using Python.

The Readme should feature a comparison to a standard solution like Diamond + InfluxDB + Grafana, and what makes this better.
I'm not in control of the protocol used, sadly. If I could, I'd pick a better one.
Windows ships with four scripting languages: the batch file language ([cmd.com] commands, exceedingly primitive); the [powershell.exe] scripting language; JScript (a Microsoft extension of EcmaScript); and VBScript (pure Microsoft). These languages are adapted to Windows, and e.g. make it easy to handle Windows text files. In contrast, with the possible exception of IronPython (I haven't tried it), Python is /not/ adapted to Windows, and depending on the version trying to read a Windows text file with straightforward code, will just crash. So there's really no competition, yet. But I think there /could be/, because Python in itself is so much better than the MS languages. However, IMHO this would first of all require some attention to detail regarding file i/o and console i/o (too bad when you can't even type things in the Python console!) and such, and secondly something like the JavaScript support on the net (node.js / io.js + all the places for collaborative and exploratory programming), and third, an effort vis-a-vis Microsoft. 
Yes. You may already have tried getting the page with urllib, but Google is the king of data mining &amp; they may not make that easy for you. To work with Google (through Python) you may need to work with selenium. Even though Python is fantastic, for this particular task I prefer [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/) or [AutoHotKey](http://www.autohotkey.com/). Python/Selenium is more than capable, but I've found that PhantomJS is *much* more efficient &amp; AutoHotKey is *much* easier. So whether it's a teeny project or a huge one that needs to scale, I stay away from Selenium.
Also dependency conflicts / relying on dependencies written by a random idiot on Pypi.
BFG is pretty cool - starring this one
&gt; That's the sad reality - internationalization is more often than not an afterthought. I agree that these problems exist, but I think they are problems to be solved rather than just get used to. I think there should be a push for internationalization to have a bigger priority than it does. The practical reality is that English is the dominant language in coding, but there are standard practices for I18N that already exist to mitigate them: **Error messages** - Use string tables. Something like this: assert False, "An error has happened." ...to this: assert False, _("An error has happened.") Where _() is a common function name for fetching the translation from a string table. It wouldn't even break code like this: try: 5 / 0 except Exception as e: if 'division by zero' in str(e): print(_('blah blah blah')) ...since it's doing comparison's between two English strings. It might break other code that uses hard-coded strings for introspection, but this is kind of a code smell anyway since it causes breaks if the code is refactored. **Comments** - Tricky, since comments are casually written and re-written. But maybe just have some format that runs them through Google Translate. It would change this: print(_('Hello')) # This is a comment. ...to this: print(_('Hello')) # This is a comment. {{Este es un comentario.}} Anyway, this is all back-of-the-envelope (heh, talking about translation makes me aware of my idioms) but I18N is like writing documentation; it's not a hard technical problem so much as it just requires motivation. Right now there's a huge segment of potential programmers that are implicitly (and unnecessarily) excluded. I18N is good for the same reason open source is good: more contributors means more and higher quality software. 
This post is about exploring right approach toward uniform use of SQL databases in async frameworks. It's NOT about "async vs threads" discussion. And there is a link in this post to the concrete results that was the whole reason of the post (search for "results" on post page). The idea of the post was to ask for community feedback before possibly wasting personal time on something that already exists. 
Cool script. For me, bs4 didn't work, so I had to change that to "import BeautifulSoup". Also, even though I have the latest Firefox 38.0.5, it crashed upon getting the source code. Sorry I can't help more, but just an FYI
My son has been liking the Hello Web App book: https://hellowebapp.com/ It walks through things at a basic level.
They still do package Jscript an Visual Basic interpreters. 
That's why they call it a programming language, you need to learn the key words
Thanks man! Don't have a specific way yet, but you can try calling the class from ipython and hitting it manually. In ipython, do something like this: from FBEraser import * eraser = Eraser(username, password) eraser.login() eraser.go_to_activity_page() Then call eraser.scroll_down() until you get to the point where you want to start deleting, then call the delete method. It's not perfect, but definitely a good future feature. Edit: Actually, if you're using iPython, you could call the class, log in, go the activity page and then manually scroll to the part you want to start, then start calling the delete method. I haven't tested this, so use at your own risk.
Not to be confused with `set1 &lt; set2`, which looks only for a *strict* subset, and not equality. `set.issubset` looks for either subsets or equality.
Hi there. You have posted a beginners question to /r/python, however it is far more suited to /r/learnpython, where users are actively interested in helping with beginner topics. Please resubmit it over there! Make sure to read their sidebar rules before posting, notably this one: "Posting homework assignments is not prohibited if you show that you tried to solve it yourself." Cheers &amp;amp; best of luck!
The real reason is that switch only does something different than if trees in a language like C. Switch is actually a goto in disguise. If you want if trees, use that instead. If you're using if trees, you can do comparsons other than equals. If you need speed, look up indexing strategies. Switch is really bad code that looks like a good idea but ends up otherwise.
What kind of *data* are you wanting to scrape, in order to get *information*? I do a lot of web scraping with Python, so I may be able to help. I use a combination of the modules Mechanize as well as BeautifulSoup4. Let me know and I'll do my best to help you out!
ah yeah, I forgot about sets. &lt;= with sets seems crazy at first but totally makes sense.
The only consistent element I could find on those links was the aria-label... values allowed on timeline, highlighted on timeline, hidden from timeline. I assumed that wouldn't work as a CSS selector, no? It seems FB is doing some dynamic stuff with their CSS classes. When I would reload the page the classes sometimes came out differently.
You and me both! [CyberCoders](http://www.cybercoders.com/search/?searchterms=python&amp;searchlocation=Atlanta%2C+GA&amp;newsearch=true&amp;sorttype=) seems to have some decent listings, especially if you like Django. LinkedIn might be another good place to check!
Yeah, find_element_by_xpath could work as well... I think that creating a bs4 instance every time you invoke delete_element() is just a bit overkill.
You could also argue how do you know other people aren't doing it already? But that would be rationalising.
Huh; bizzarre. I know a bunch of dotNET stuff (powershell?) likes to emit UTF16, because Windows has to be a few years behind everyone else (I think there's an RFC or something saying so). Python3 basically now expects UTF8 because it's 2015. In this case though the traceback suggests it's an outbound encoding issue: that the unicode-to-teminal-encoding pipe is what's breaking? In other words, that the CMD prompt is reporting that it needs encoding to X, but UTF8 to X isn't well supported? Odd, anyway. Did you file a bug report (although it seems perhaps to be an "upstream" problem..)?
it's not ordered, but sets apparently do most of it: http://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/392unr/python_script_to_find_blizzard_employees/cs0vwck
Sure thing
would like to be in for this
With out knowing much about the text file content structure. Something as simple as below would work if each image_url was on its own line in the text file import urllib import time count = 0 with open('text_containing_links.txt', 'r') as input: for image_url in input: urllib.urlretrieve(image_url, image_url.jpg) # second parameter is filepath to be saved at count += 1 if count == 500: # depends on server time.sleep(60) #seconds count = 0
Yup. I am in.
It's a great idea, it just doesn't work. There are unescaped single quotes in the French examples.
I can't say I often find myself missing switch/case. It seems like a fairly specialized construct that is only occasionally beneficial; even then, not usually by much, and given the "fall through" behavior, can be pretty buggy/confusing. I don't think the pros really outweigh the cons. It doesn't pull its own weight. With all the stuff constantly being added to Python, personally I wish we'd slow down, instead of pining for even more baggage.
I miss the python logo for one thing. I think it's easier for me to say what I like about the current /r/python theme that I'd like to see carried into the next one: namely, I like how the current theme looks a lot like the python foundation's website. So things like the logo and those color themes (including the light blue on dark blue parts at the top of the page) to stay.
It wouldn't have to have the exact same function as a C switch statement, with continuation and whatnot. I'd be happy with "prettier" syntax for an if-elif-elif-elif block. I picture something like switch x: 5: print("x was 5") 6: doThing() y + 8 / 3 + blarg(): doLots() ofThings() Not sure that's really prettier though...
From following the Python-ideas mailing list, the best answer I can find is "nobody has figured out a good enough switch/case syntax for Python". You would need to come up with something that is clearly better than if..elseif in simple cases or clearly better than a dict of functions in complex cases. So far, no proposal has sufficiently compelling syntax that it is better enough than these approaches to justify further complicating the language.
Also I need to have exactly three values, each a number
Switch-case is just special syntax for exposing a possibly architecture-dependent idiom: the jump table. 
Because: "There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it." Switch is just a different syntax for if elif else.
Well, you could make it a list and then append to it later: a = {'key': [1]} a['key'].append(2) a['key'] += [3]
When compiled down to a jump table, sure (but then just use a dict/hashtable and you get the same kind of functionality). If not optimized, a switch statement without continuations is exactly equivalent to a series of if/elif blocks.
why use selenium instead of urllib or requests or facebook api?
There are a lot of ways you can format that so it sucks less, specifically most of the time when you're using a switch, you aren't special casing every single thing, you're calling out to different predefined functions, so that'd look like switch = { str: process_string, int: process_int, list: process_list, dict: process_dict, } switch[type(obj)](obj) where process_x are library functions that you've imported/defined elsewhere/written over the last 30 lines instead of defining them inline, etc.
What I would do is to read the file into python, and use the requests library to download them. Just easier with requests versus urllib etc. Personal opinion. Reading the file in is as simple as with open("filename.txt", "r") as f: urls = f.readlines() and then looping through the resulting list with a for loop and using requests to get the URL.
Urllib and requests don't render JavaScript, and there is a butt ton of JavaScript on that page required to make the actual delete feature show up. That having been said, I'm definitely looking for a more lightweight and quick solution than selenium for this project.
Hi all, Been searching around without much luck so I thought I'd ask here. Does anyone know of a working example of a bokeh-server plot where there exists a multi-line time series and below that timeseries are various statistical plots based on the multi-line time series selection? The statistical plots can be histograms, scatterplots, correlation coef, PDFs, CDFs, etc. My idea is to also be able to select/unselect (via checkbox) different variables and compare/constrast these variables on-the-fly using a bokeh-server. Thanks for any and all input.
Thanks Graham, thats exactly what i did. mod_wsgi from PyPI worked wonderfully, just loaded newly compiled mod_wsgi.so file that was compiled by pip install mod_wsgi and it just worked. Well done on the pain free package.

Cox Media Group are in Atlanta and were doing a lot of Django projects for big-name clients some time ago, not sure if that's still the case. http://www.coxmediagroup.com/
You realize that most of these already exist, right? Edit: Wow. I just looked at the code. def lowerp(string): print(string.lower()) Why would I EVER want to use this? Your way, I'd have to go: from jpt import lowerp a=lowerp("UPPERCASE") whereas with standard python... a="UPPERCASE".lower() Why would anyone want to do this your way? Edit2: Okay, assuming I wanted this function: def username(): usernameou = os.environ.get("USERNAME") return usernameou Why would you not just do: def username(): return os.environ.get("USERNAME") Edit 3: def nonum(string): string = string.replace('1', '') string = string.replace('2', '') string = string.replace('3', '') string = string.replace('4', '') string = string.replace('5', '') string = string.replace('6', '') string = string.replace('7', '') string = string.replace('8', '') string = string.replace('9', '') return string could be replaced by: def nonum(instring): import string return "".join(x for x in instring if x not in string.digits) 
Yeah, but fall through would be super weird/non-pythonic. Maybe call it something else. ifblock? condition? swifch? Ok fine, no switch statements. :P
A lot of great suggestions. I'm by no means an expert, but a big reason most of that stuff is sloppy is because it started out as a hasty script thrown together by me (meant for one time use), now being posted as a repo because a few friends expressed interest. I'm definitely hoping for this to grow into something more refined, and comments like this are exactly what I'm looking for. Thanks!
Nice, I love automating with python and selenium, it works really well

&gt; He complained that "performance improvements are not bug fixes" and that it would be better to spend time making Python 3 better. We need a proper Python 2 fork. The current maintainers' interests conflict with those of the user base.
you can use [collections](https://docs.python.org/2/library/collections.html) for that.
&gt; Good that you rephrased your previous answer. You clearly didn't assume the first time. Your expanded answer makes much more sense now. Gotta say, I'm not sure what most of that means. (What did I not assume the first time?) And, truthfully, I think that most of what's in the expanded answer is not more sensible, but just does more work to avoid misreadings. &gt; Regarding functionality, Windows a higher level of comfort. There is a reason they moved away from a traditional desktop, and re-invented everything. People hated that but did they stop using it? No. Why? Comfort zone. Well. I think it's worthwhile to think about what that comfort zone is made up of: the fact that most software that is written for contemporary computers is written for Windows. That is to say, what drives Windows piracy in the third world is not the choice of Windows as the best operating system by any measure except that it's the most popular. People assume that Windows is "how a computer is supposed to work" explicitly because most or all of the computers that they've previously encountered have worked that way, because most or all of the computers they've previously encountered have used Windows. Again, it's the inertia of ubiquity, not great design, that makes Windows continually ubiquitous.
&gt; The main problem with your argument is that the 'dumb' users are not disadvantaged by having Python preinstalled, or would even know about it. Not knowing you're being disadvantaged isn't the same thing as not being disadvantaged. There are real advantages to having Python installed: if nothing else, it opens up an awful lot of software options to people. Whether they know that they have those options is one thing; but it's not the same thing as not having them. Not having Python preinstalled is a barrier to using many many pieces of software for many many people. &gt; p.s. don't conflate computer knowledge with general intelligence. I don't. I know many many smart people who "are not computer people." No single area of knowledge or skill is a fair predictor for overall intelligence, and I'm fully aware of that. On the other hand: low overall intelligence is a barrier to the development of many skills. This was precisely my point. &gt; Many people don't know much about computers, that doesn't make them 'stupid' or 'dumb' I have [recently argued precisely this position](http://www.reddit.com/r/linux4noobs/comments/35zmt0/getting_frustrated_please_help_me_install_linux/cragrch).
In the past, people have had the same issue with Smalltalk. No case statement. The solution in Smalltalk is the same as Python - use a dictionary. Personally I find the dictionary a much more powerful construct to solving the problem because you dynamically modify it / update it at run time. I've never ever missed the switch statement in Smalltalk or Python. In fact I have the opposite issue - when going to languages that offer a switch statement, but no simple dictionary-like object for building up choice maps, I begrudgingly use a case/switch statement.
Sounds like you are solving the problem in the wrong way. Desribe the problem for a better solution.
I'm not averse to keeping this. Maybe I need to back up a step and ask the question - do we need to make a change?
I don't really want a switch/case syntax, but given whitespace making breaks unnecessary, wouldn't something like this work fine? switch x: case 1: ... case 2: ... case: # default ...
Then you can't case 1: case 2: somethingForBoth() 
I try your crash.py with python 2.7.5 &amp; 3.4 in win7. It doesn't crash. While my default cmd windows can't display the text properly it is cmd's problem not python. Running the same script in spyder's console display the text nicely. 
No.
&gt; This at least weeds out some of the dumb people, because one of the characteristics of dumb people is that they don't make choices, they just go along with the majority and here I am using Python because it is the most popular programming language :p 
obligitory /r/learnpython The third line won't do anything because `session` isn't defined, but the 2nd line is defining the database connection parameters. `localhost:6379` means the Redis server is running on the same machine as the Python code, with the default port `6379` exposed. `db=0` is the Redis database index to put your stuff in, I believe by default there are 16 (0-15). And setting `session_expirary` to `False` you're saying that the connections from the Python process to the Redis server process should remain open for communication, instead of establishing new connections every time you `Get` or `Set` keys/values. Good luck!
Working in big non-IT company, I can confirm this. Just half year ago I finally convinced the top level to use postgres 9.3 in some production servers. Now I struggle (politically) to upgrade to 9.4 and we still don't upgrade thousands of our windows xp &amp; ms office 2003, hundreds of oracle 10g, and a single python 2.3 (thank god now it only a single box). 
I think I'd prefer case in 1, 2: something() for consistency. Since Python wouldn't be able to take advantage of optimizations like jump tables (everything's an object) you could even allow iterables! b = [2, 3] case 1: doA() case in b: doB()
Thorough explanation. Thank you! 
And Guido disagreed. Don't worry, it's fine. Still the end of the whole argument was "This discussion is pointless; it's already been merged".
elif covers it but to echo what everyone else is saying. Switches are usually bad.
haha! Just why I'm trying to learn it, myself. Part of the reason, anyway.
My general rule of thumb is that if there's a language or library feature that's useful, cheap, and missing, then either Guido dislikes that programming style or doesn't really care to understand it.
I'd give up a foot for pattern matching. I've not seen Rust or Swift pattern matching, how does it compare to Haskell?
.. cognitive load, not CPU load.
Something I've been saving for a summer project. Excellent tutorial, thank you.
No. Because it's common in a language like C to say case 'foo': dosomefoostuff(); case 'bar': dosomefooandbarstuff(); break;
I'm not aware of any major differences besides syntax, but I don't claim to know much about either of those two languages; I only used them as examples because I assumed people would have more familiarity with them than Haskell.
Dropping dope Assembly knowledge. They're all JUMP statements of some kind. JE, JNE, JZ (shaboy), etc.
&gt; I read somethere a microsoft employee saying there is an internal policy on shipping windows only with microsoft created products Tons of bloatware have come on every computer that has Windows pre-installed I've ever gotten.
And in others to not do this (Scala, rust, ...)
There are such thin wrappers I can't imagine you ever needing them. Most could be simplified to one line at which point does it even make sense to have them as a separate function? 
Couldn't this work? case 1: pass case 2: somethingForBoth()
Hmmm.....in windows 7, python 2.7.5 nothing crashed chcp 437 in cmd displayed incorrect text chcp 1252 displayed the text correctly chcp 65001 also displayed the text correctly I remember in a stackoverflow question that you need to set the fonts to lucida (which is my default fonts in cmd shell, but i try with raster fonts and it still display correctly) btw I'm not an expert in this utf-8 things since my country is latin only alphabet. So don't count on me about this topic :)
Not necessarily. A jump table is an efficient representation if you need to choose between multiple branches, but it's not always the representation that is chosen, nor is it always necessary (since it depends entirely on the content of the cases).
The "dispatch method" in the article looks really hacky to me. I'm far from a Python expert but generally I always feel like if I'm constructing a variable/method name by concatenating strings, it's not great code.

You could screenshot the desktop, then wallpaper your window with the appropriate part of the bitmap. This is the old ghetto way of doing transparency.
It doesn't require the fall through by definition, I don't think C# needs break after every case. It's a pretty general construct and the use of elifs and dicts is not a nice replacement. Sounds to me like you're just backing the decision not for its merits but because that's what the python leaders chose.
Here's a simple switch function I came up with: def switch(value): def _get_case(cases, default=None): return cases.get(value, default) return _get_case Used like this: switch(x)({ 1: 'hello', 2: 'hi', 3: 'sup' )} Tho it doesn't support executing functions :P

I like his attitude of keeping scaling in mind. Most homebrew projects can't survive an expansion of scope because it's patched together with duct tape and if chewing_gum == true: 
I disagree, I find switch much more confusing than if/elif blocks. Ifs are much more explicit.
Thanks for reporting this! This might be related to missing support for WebGL shaders on your platform. Which version of Chromium are you running with which graphics card? If you're not on the latest build try updating it. WebGL support is still somewhat experimental in many browsers / OSes, but we will try our best to make it work for you.
Thanks, I'll have a look at this! Maybe we can check for compatibility with fragment shaders when we run the code and fall back to normal shading if they're not supported.
Thats a really great question, I have been trying to figure that out too!
That's bloatware from the constructor, not from MS.
Sorry for making you wait, can you post a link to your project (if it's public)? Right now there are many projects in the queue and we have only a limited number of workers for OS projects (14), so some delay might occur. You'll receive an e-mail notification as soon as the analysis is finished btw!

/r/learnpython is for questions, despite the name. You might get better luck over there. /r/Python is for news and releases.
The lack of TCO and proper lambdas makes Python awkward at best for functional programming in my experience. I'll have to read the book for tips though!
Every release adds stuff. Simple as that. It's a growing pile of stuff. My most annoying example is that they added the new string formatting method and then backed out of removing the old string formatting. So now we have two ways to do it, forever.
Very slick. How hard would it be to implement rotation of the 3D city graph graphic when clicking with the mouse and dragging? The hovering over the buttons feels a tad bit clunky. Still, it looks great. D3.js is one of the many things on my long list of things I wish to learn and hopefully someday master with some level of success.
For what it's worth, that was inspired near verbatim from the official Python answer. In other words, I don't disagree with you. ;)

Make a proper package and use setuptools entry points to select the wanted driver at runtime.
http://inventwithpython.com/ im using these. Free, with clear explanations and walkthroughs of source code in each example. Most progress I've *ever* made with python/programming. Other resources are not nearly as interesting or show as much sign of progress. Also, it's written entirely for Python 3.
Here is my experience 1. Wrote several production apps in Flask/Mongo/Mongoengine/Flask-Restful, Django/Postgres/Django ORM/Django Rest Framework. 2. What I don't like in Flask - Fragmented packages (i.e. hard to setup/customize) - Fragmented documentation (*not clear in many cases how to use) - You will end up re-inventing the wheel, as it's micro-framework. 3. What I don't like in mongoengine - When you need sophisticated (behind simple CRUDs) uses cases it becomes buggy and you have to debug in order to understand where the problem is - No support for aggregation framework, just pure CRUD - Cluttered documentation - Slow "community". IRC is atrocious at best. - It relies on FKs to be ObjectId, therefore integrating with let's say with other libs/languages in future (microservices) would become much more problematic, if they treat FKs as simple strings instead of objectId - Slow. I mean REALLY VERY SLOW especially to process data in foreach cycles. I had to switch to raw pymongo to process some of the data flow (27 sec in mongoengine vs 1.7 sec in pymongo for the same operation) I do like their "cache field type" - it allows to implement less reads among collections 4. Flask-restful is just fine but compared to Django Rest Framework I have to write 10 times less code, therefore my productivity is WAY HIGHER with Django/DRF/Postgres/Django ORM than with Flask/Flask-Restful/Mongo/Mongoengine. 5. What I don't like in DRF - Hard to customize responses, it's always in { "field": [errors] "non-field-errors": [] } and usually with 400 http code back. However DRF is GREAT with serializers/validators/custom permissions and has deep integration with Django Code in DRF is much easier to read (in most cases it's convention over customization), grab model, define serializer, define validators, permissions. All methods get/put/post etc are very short. Code is MUCH MUCH easier to maintain compared to code written in Flask. 6. Mongo I love MONGO. Especially the aggregation framework. And for finacial apps - aggregation framework may bring TONS of value. No migrations, scaling is easy (although there are some issues with sharding), I get much less collections compared to amount of tables in similar SQL solution. However - if your nature is "TRANSACTIONS", I would rethink use of Mongodb Pymongo - is GREAT. Mongo MMS is great to deploy clusters on AWS in minutes and monitor. However if nature of your app is "RELATIONAL" - then Mongo would become your liability and nightmare. You will end up making SQL-like solution in NoSQL terms and you will gain nothing, just additional headaches. If your app is "document" oriented, where a lot of information can be persisted within a single collection - then Mongo is FANTASTIC. You need to get used to querying the data (it's not intuitive when you start to use various modifiers), but it's not an obstacle. I **absolutely** WOULD NOT recommend to use mongoengine for production-complex-apps. Very annoyed with a lot of things. 7. I would use flask/flask-restful as a micro-service and left authentication service written in something else. Flask app then just get authorization token (or public API endpoints). I.e. I would do as little customization to flask / flask-restful as possible - then it would be a good solution. As soon as you see that you need this and this and that in Flask, that is not available out of the box - revise your decision to use Flask (or drop the requirements) 8. A lot of beauties is available in Django/DRF - batteries included! Middlewares etc. They don't exist in Flask. So my opinion is Django/Postgres vs Flask/Mongo is 10:1 towards Django. Less code, features delivered faster, documentation is no-issue. I would not go into Django/Mongo as Django is all about postgres :) 
Which languages are supported?
Glad you find them helpful. The repo is under Apache 2.0, an author credit/repo link would be appreciated :) Some notebooks I reference were created by other authors—I’ve provided credit by naming the author and/or providing a link to the source. If you plan on redistributing you might want to check their licenses for more info. 
Hey, sorry, I do not get notifications here so I had no clue there are issues here. Would it be too much to ask to post the issue also here: https://github.com/kootenpv/yagmail/issues/ ? Could you also show how you log in (do you have the right host and port?) I'm very curious and I hope I can solve the issue.
Amazing post, do you know if pygal supports static x axis mapping? 
 Thanks, been looking for some more resources for functional programming.
Thanks for the post, this has potential applications for me almost immediately!
Cool, this is a nice resource. Thanks for maintaining it.
Please dont assume that I jumped ship. The contract world is brutal. And employment is scarce.
The current theme works well already and is simple. Changing it is not pythonic.
I like to keep things out of environment variables too. You can modify where Python searches for files in Python by modifying sys.path. E.g. import sys sys.path.append('../utilities') Alternatively, I like to have a make-like script that has commands that run my app, run tests, package up files, etc. It can set PYTHONPATH when it executes your different drivers, that way your PYTHONPATH is in a textfile and can be checked into version control.

Neat project and I might be interested in using this in the future. Is there a place for feature requests? - Markdown badge does not work in github README.md. - It would be *really* nice if I could have an 'ignore' or 'revisit later' option for the anti-patterns. For instance, one of my projects uses eval(), but it's kind of necessary and I've already taken security into account. So while I agree, it should be a warning(and something to be left on), for this specific warning, I don't need it.
Use this for your Windows box and see if it works. http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pillow 
Do you have an example or tutorial for this? I've been doing python development for 5 years and avoid setuptools like the plague...mostly because I can't find a decent resource how to use it.
Pandas + Matplotlib + Seaborn will make life easy for you!
If this isn't what you are looking for, it probably should be :) http://cs109.github.io/2014/
Thanks for your feedback! We have a public issue tracker on Github, where you can also post feature requests: https://github.com/quantifiedcode/issues I'll look into the badge problem ASAP. We have the possibility to ignore/exclude certain files, for this you can create a `.checkignore` file to your repository: http://docs.quantifiedcode.com/configuration/config_checkignore.html?highlight=checkignore We will soon expose this feature through the frontend as well. Marking false positives / ignoring certain issues will come soon. If you want to ignore all occurrences of a given issue in your project you can disable it in the "Settings / Anti-Patterns" tab (just turn it to "OFF").
Thanks for reporting this and sorry for this issue, we're working on improving this.
We offer an "Enterprise" version of our software actually, if you're interested in this feel free to get in touch with us: https://www.quantifiedcode.com/contact
Needs an easier way to change the subtitle language than editing the actual code.
Any reason in particular why you want both ``mycli-xyz`` and ``mycli xyz`` to exist?
It is in order to behave similar to git does. * `mycli-xyz` is the standalone script/executable that a user has extended mycli with * `mycli xyz` is a convenience, in the same way that `git activity` would be a convenience for calling `git-activity`
Thanks for the the feedback. As I'd mentioned in the post though It appears from many of the examples online (http://click.pocoo.org/4/complex/#building-a-git-clone) that all of the sub-commands are themselves pure Python. What I need is something that will support calling executables in the 'sub-commands' dir that are executable and named with the correct prefix
Thanks!
Right, you want a "command subcommand arguments" kind of interface, while letting each subcommand be implemented as a separate executable of its own, so that they can be implemented using other things than Python. /u/hikhvar's solution works, though I wouldn't touch ``sys.argv`` directly for the sake of having better error reporting. You can use any of the previously mentioned parsers to pluck the first argument out, though I will predictably recommend mine, Clize. You could write a function using [LAST_OPTION](http://clize.readthedocs.org/en/3.0/reference.html#forcing-arguments-to-be-treated-as-positional) like so: from clize import run, Parameter @annotate(subcommand=Parameter.LAST_OPTION) def dispatch(subcommand, *args): pass #do things with subcommand and args run(dispatch)
Can you produce interactive SVGs with these tools like you can with Pygal?
That green snake thingy is a foul phallic symbol, how can it be Feminist? Stick to C+=, pls.
Ugh, what does this website do to scrolling and why?! I had to resort to tapping up/down arrows.
Maybe they support themes from now on and its a matter of time before We start to see themes publicly available... Rodeo is great BTW. 
Works for me without error: from PIL import Image, ImageTk from tkinter import Tk, Label app = Tk() pil_img = Image.open("test.jpg") im = ImageTk.PhotoImage(pil_img) image = Label(app, image=im).pack() app.mainloop()
"self" always refers to the current instance of that class. In other languages, it's often called "this", and it usually doesn't need to be passed as a parameter. Remember, a class definition describes a *kind* of object. Each instance of that class is itself unique. If I have a class "Car", each instance of class "Car" is a specific car. "self" is simply how a car can refer to itself in code.
Why don't feminist use Linux? Because they don't want to type man for help ;)
/r/learnpython
Attaching self to a class method means that this method will use and change the properties of this specific instance of this class. If you write a class you write a "blueprint" for every instance you will create, each future instance will organize itself with the given rules. At the beginning it seems repetetive to use the self, because every method you will wrote only refers to the instance, BUT later you will notice that class variable, class-methods and static-method exists, then you will need the self argument to distiguish these stuff from the instance stuff. Here a little example: class Test(): arg_list = [] #this variable is shared with all instances def __init__(self, x): self.arg_list.append(x) self.x = x a = Test(1) a.x &gt;&gt;&gt;1 #instance variable a.arg_list # class variable &gt;&gt;&gt; [1] b = Test(2) b.x &gt;&gt;&gt;2 b.arg_list &gt;&gt;&gt; [1, 2] c = Test(3) c.x &gt;&gt;&gt;3 c.arg_list &gt;&gt;&gt; [1,2,3] a.arg_list.append("Stuff") a.arg_list &gt;&gt;&gt;[1,2,3, "Stuff"] c.arg_list &gt;&gt;&gt;[1,2,3, "Stuff"] #all instances are sharing the same variable Sometimes you also want to write helper methods in your class that don't need to work with your instance, then you won't need to use self. By the way you can call "self" what ever you want, as long as you use it consistant. 
Come down to Manuel's tavern tonight about six thirty. PyAtl is meeting tonight there. There's usually hiring announcements going on. Off the top of my head Pindrop Security and Brightlink are both looking for Python people. Brightlink is a webshop, so they're looking for Python + Frontend. Pindrop does audio security, they're looking for Python, Linux, C++ and maybe Web (not 100% sure). 
An instance method has to have some way of identifying which instance it's been invoked on, otherwise what would be the point? In other languages this parameter is passed implicitly, but it's explicit in Python. This simplifies things, as there is only one way to define a function, regardless of whether it's a free function or a method; a method is just a regular function that lives as an attribute of a class(*) and takes an extra parameter. (*) It can get there either by having been defined in the body of a class definition, like all class attributes, or added manually to the class at some later point in time.
I can say it _has_ to be better than c++. [This](https://www.gnu.org/fun/jokes/declarations.html) page has some extremely sexist jokes. Example: class woman { #define be private: be friend class of_girls; off_t o_the_mall() { for (;;) mall.go_to(rand()).shop(); } }; 
Why not just tar czf env.tar env/
The easiest way to understand objects is to borrow from *The Holy Grail* and remember: it's only a model. An object is a model of a thing. You've taken some idea and modeled it in code, created an instance, so now you have a thing in code that behaves like a thing in the real world. A class is a generic way to talk about a set of things that all have something similar about them. While *my* car and *your* car are different objects, they're both things that are cars (both members of the class car).
&lt;pedantic remark&gt; &gt;"self" always refers to the current instance of that class. Actually, the first argument of a bound method refers to the object that the method was bound to. &gt;&gt;&gt; class Foo: ... def __init__(self): ... self.cookies = "I've got rhythm!" ... def wat(self): ... print(self.cookies) ... &gt;&gt;&gt; class Bar: ... def __init__(self, wat): ... self.wat = wat ... &gt;&gt;&gt; f = Foo() &gt;&gt;&gt; b = Bar(f.wat) &gt;&gt;&gt; b.wat() I've got rhythm! Also, it doesn't have to be 'self'. 'self' is just a convention used by most python programmers. This variable could literally be any valid python name. &lt;/pedant remark&gt;
I guess, jokes are sexist only when they're about womyn. Jokes about Y-chromosome owners don't count.
Does it work with differing paths? One of the main roadblocks to portable virtualenvs is that they tend to have the root paths hardcoded in various places, including the `#!` lines of some scripts.
We are actually evaluating this solution at work right now for our production python deployments. The analogy is an executable jar for java, since you can run the pex file directly without extraction.
This general problem has been a scourge on deploying python for a while now. So many of the good/interesting packages you'll want to use have hard dependencies on native code being available that in many cases the only sane way to package it up all up is to build a VM template with everything installed and use that to deploy new machines. In comparison, deploying Go/Scala/Clojure/Haskell is much simpler
I originally didn't like this idea, but after thinking about it, it sounds awesome.
Not at all. You can be sexist to a male or racist to a white person. It is just way more common for sexism to a female.
[This](http://stackoverflow.com/a/29489919/1581394) rather pretty "check if a string repeats itself" function might fit here as well. def principal_period(s): i = (s+s).find(s, 1, -1) return None if i == -1 else s[:i]
It doesn't appear that pex supports Windows, which is a pain.
thanks, never saw it. I've just heard the name.
------- (sarcasm) ---------&gt; (your head) (And yes, you left **really** offensive joke about men out and posted mildly offencive one as an example.)
Cool library, I like the visual style in the console. Does the dot show up on different terminals too? Also, what do you think about naming the methods 'ok, debug, error' so you can write log.error instead of log.write ('error',...)? Seems less verbose but just as descriptive to me, and makes the interface match the logging package. 
&gt; Also, it doesn't have to be 'self'. 'self' is just a convention used by most python programmers. This variable could literally be any valid python name. Indeed there are cases where by convention a different name is used. For example, a `classmethod` usually uses `cls` as the first parameter: class Foo: @classmethod def bar(cls, spam): print(spam) In this case `cls` is `Foo` or a subclass of `Foo`. Another case is metaclasses, where `cls` and `meta` might be used: class MetaClass(type): def __new__(meta, name, bases, attrs): print(meta, name, bases, attrs) return super().__new__(meta, name, bases, attrs) def __init__(cls, name, bases, attrs): print(cls, name, bases, attrs) super().__init__(name, bases, attrs)
The real reason is that in the early early days Python didn't have fancy scope handling, so the "all the object's attributes are in scope" way C++ does it just wasn't possible. Passing in the object to a method was a hacky way to get around this. Of course we have proper scopes now, but `self` stays. I actually prefer it to the C++ way; with `self.___` I'm explicitly referencing "the ___ attribute of the object I was called on" and not just "some variable named ___ (which actually turns out to be an attribute)." It also allows you to do things like this: def __init__(self,foo,bar): self.foo=foo self.bar=bar instead of how in C you'd *have* to figure out two names for the same thing, or put an underscore on the end of the parameter version or something.
Thanks! The thought's crossed my mind, I'm probably going to put that in this afternoon. Originally I just wanted a flexible solution, but it's just as easy to have a general "write" method for custom messages on top of dedicated methods, I guess. The output should display (roughly) the same across any terminal [emulator] with colour and unicode support. In the photo in the README, I'm emulating xterm256 under OS X's Terminal.app.
I dunno if we're supposed to be making fun of these people or something, but this particular event seems pretty inoffensive. 
Ohhh I see. Thank you! I thought current is a python keyword or something. This makes sense :)
But again, pretty sure it can't load native code libs from a zip, which effects pretty much every python dist library, where you have library.zip and a mess of .dll files that have to be outside the zip for some technical reason :/
I'll put it on the checklist - hopefully will get that working sometime tomorrow!
Yes, quite right. I wasn't thinking of that case.
Shouldn't docker fix that issue? I know support for OSX and Windows is lackluster, but you can use boot2docker to solve some of them.
&gt; I understand: &gt;&gt; from file_a import function_X Looks like you didn't. Next time, try /r/learnpython.
PEX has a bootstrapper that extracts anything that needs to be in the file system, so it's perfectly fine to add C extensions – only that obviously the platform independence is lost.
Since there's obviously so much confusion on the topic… https://py-generic-project.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installing.html#pex-install https://py-generic-project.readthedocs.org/en/latest/packaging.html#packaging-python-executables-pex
Oh absolutely, it should do something like that. But I'm saying that by default virtualenv doesn't do that: http://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.org/en/latest/command_ref.html#cpvirtualenv In your bin/activate script you can see the full path to the virtualenv folder right there, so you can't easily package the entire thing up. Here's the part of the code which puts that in: https://github.com/pypa/virtualenv/blob/7a8239fc6abaf0ae531b78c24a654372b2fb9fcc/virtualenv.py#L1527
Thanks, I'll keep checking out her things then, maybe it's Pillow v 2.8.2 that has this issue, or maybe it's Anaconda at fault.
Use Click, including the ability to add Python sub-commands directly, and add a dynamic command loader, equivalent to http://click.pocoo.org/4/advanced/#command-aliases – only that `get_command` looks into the designated script dir and returns a small wrapper object when a matching script is there.
I would suggest to NOT use the GPL license for code that it's intended to be used as a library. GPL is fine for "tools" or "full programs", but if a library I would like to use is GPL'ed it forces me to also GPL my program, and maybe that's not what I want. Make it at least LGPL, or MIT/BSD (I like those better, but that's just me). Take care!
It's also for performance reasons. An oft-cited piece of Python "wisdom" is to move the inner-loop bottlenecks to pure C and invoke them with Python. I'm sure it's fine advice, though I personally haven't had a use case for that; honestly, if I needed performance that badly, I'd probably reimplement that whole module in C++. Other modern languages (Go, Rust) are already compiled and so don't have the need for performance tricks that Python does.

With CS and programming, the importance of structured plans is huge. I often write out in a notebook the structure of a project many times before I write code. It helps as an outline for later steps, but also helps you realize which parts are modular and can be split apart. Look into top down and bottom up design ([wiki here](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-down_and_bottom-up_design)). Scrapy was suggested. It's good for getting structured data from unstructured sources, like your log info. Then, you want to manipulate it. Finally, you want to put it into a spreadsheet. Additionally, you want this to have an automated periodic run throughout the day. Those are all top level pieces. :) Hope that helps. Good luck.
I've tried to solve packing up a whole virtualenv and shipping it to a target OS by creating [vdist](https://github.com/objectified/vdist). Vdist doesn't actually pack up the whole virtualenv and zip it up for that same reason - you can't rule out native code. Instead it builds an OS package which may very well depend on other OS packages when it comes to native bindings. Granted, it will only work for OSes that can be dockerized, but I presume that covers a large percent of the Python deployment targets.
One resource that I'd recommend that isn't in the side bar is [Think Python: How to Think Like a Computer Scientist](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/html/index.html). For simple spreadsheets I prefer CSV files to Excel files. CSV is just easier to work with. (Non-proprietary and you can even open csv files in a simple text editor for quick inspection.) If you do need to work with Excel spreadsheets, see http://www.python-excel.org/. 
How do you up the recursion limit?
This link was submitted one year ago, at the time it contained only 10 good resources, but has recently been updated to reflect some new additions and changes to the overall recommendations of popular Python communities.
for running scripts on demand or on periodic cycles, I have an instance of [Jenkins](https://jenkins-ci.org/) running on my pc, or you could set it up on a server somewhere. All it does is contain one line batch command that calls python.exe scriptname.py 
That's awesome news! MicroPython is an amazing project, really happy to see this level of investment in its future.
If I fully understood what you wanted to do I think your code looks right. Just add a print for "Houston we have lift off!". N = 1 while N &lt;= 10: print (N) N += 1 print ("Houston we have lift off!") Edit: You may have a look at /r/learnpython
Indentation is important in Python. Make sure it's correct.
It's 1000 by default, I think. import sys sys.setrecursionlimit(10000)
&gt; so don't have the need for performance tricks that Python does. The trick literally being, "avoid using Python". XD
So wait, what do those packages do? I do need to interact with excel files a lot for this project. How do I use these packages you linked? 
/r/reviewmycode is available. You can also ask questions here, in /r/learnpython, and in /r/learnprogramming.
I would do: for N in range(1,11): print(N) print("Houston we have liftoff!")
Yeah I agree on all points. I find Ruby *much* easier to read- I was able to read a plugin for a complicated framework (puppet) and understand pretty much exactly what was going on right away. However, when I sit down to *write* it, it's a nightmare, what with it having a hundred synonyms for everything and countless ways to do everything. That being said, if you can keep the language vocabulary and syntax very very contained and focused- don't make it too generic- I think I'd prefer the first one.
No. Start with the basics. * You say that you want to get info from a website. It is unclear to me whether that website is your own (and your boss wants you to get info from the logs that are generated on the server) or if the website is online somewhere (and you need to get info from that website). Which is it? * If it's the former, determine what format the logs are in. Think about how you could read that information using a script. If it's a standard format, there's probably a library for it. Also think about what information you want to get, and think of a step by step way to get it. E.g. "the information is in the third column of every row, so I need to read in all the rows and for each row get the data from the third cell". * If it's the latter, then go to the website in your browser and click File &gt; Save as. Save it in your project folder. Open the file in a text editor and check out its structure. What parts would you like to extract from the page? Check out [this page](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) and look around for some other tutorials on how to use the package. * Write a script that can read in the data and print the first data point to the screen. Build from there. * When you know how to print the relevant data to the screen, you can move on to store all the data in a useful way. Think about how you can structure the information that you're acquiring. This might be superfluous, but don't work on the only copy of the data! Just work on some copies that are representative of the data you'll encounter when your script is finished. Make sure you don't overwrite anything important. Oh, and about the server thing: that's for when you're finished. It's possible to have the company server automatically run the script for you periodically, so that all the data is regularly updated without anyone having to think about it.
As I just finished typing in an email I haven't sent yet, to the author: . &gt;Fun and amusing article. &gt;However, a discussion of Squeak is, in my not-so-humble and certainly-shameless opinion (IMNSHACSO), incomplete without mentioning my youtube channel video series for beginners: &gt;_Squeak from the very start._ &gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Es7RyllOS-M&amp;list=PL6601A198DF14788D &gt;One of the "Gang of Four" (the authors of _Design Patterns_) sent me an email a while back saying that my videos were what he sent his students to when they wanted to learn Smalltalk, so it may not be the best possible way to learn Smalltalk, but it IS hopefully a better-than-average introduction. &gt;Enjoy. 
Yes. Start with the basics. I was talking only about if you have scripts you want to run on a schedule or you want your boss to be able to trigger or trigger from other events
That sounds backwards to me. When there's 100 synonyms for something, I can write whichever I want, but when I try to read somebody else's code, they always use the variants that I've never heard of.
Yeah, I thought it made sense at first, too, but it makes the documentation way harder to use somehow. Plus it means that the decision of "what's the best way to do this" much harder- "oh is select or filter more appropriate here?"
Project Gutenberg or archive.org have full novels and book available in txt format.
Cool! Xray is really the way to go if you analyze gridded data.
W/ regards to docker, I think you might be missing something. I take advantage of docker by being able to develop on Archlinux, build and image based on _any distro_ and then still let my sysadminds deploy to centos 6.5+. I use Jenkins to auto build new images, and drop them in our local registry. Then a ticket goes into the system for the sysadmins to push the new image to preprpod for testing. In the end I get a nice binary I can hand over with log files and config files externalized and dependencies internalized. It certainly has issues and rough points but it has made deploying python apps much easier for me and the sysadmins that support my software. 
But if you're already using Docker, what point would there be in using PEX or even virtualenv for that matter?
&gt;The requested topic does not exist.
[Forum post](http://forum.micropython.org/viewtopic.php?f=8&amp;t=744)
For not running sudo when installing packages and targeting a specific Python version rather than relying on or overwriting the default. I'm not sure how the Python on build images would interact, as my Docker experience is limited. But I'm gonna try it out more thoroughly with my next app (simple gallery/portfolio app, but I need imagemagick to convert pdfs to images). 
I don't think you can import a keyword.
You'd have to ask Microsoft.
I wrote a module called pyperform that makes timeit much more convenient and is designed to allow developers to quickly run test cases and compare them against each other. Check it out. It can create basic reports comparing different tests. https://github.com/lobocv/pyperform 
Thanks, didn't know about help and it is useful for getting straight to the docstring but sometimes going deeper is more difficult and I'm not sure why it has to be this way.
&gt; Now, back to our main steps: &gt; &gt; We can use Python to read the name of our neatly organized movie files. &gt; Rotten Tomatoes have an official API[2] , so we can easily find ratings. Requests[3] module will help us communicating with their API. &gt; Rotten Tomatoes API returns data in a JSON format. Requests can easily handle that. &gt; We can use several modules to modify metadata: enzyme[4] and hachoir-metadata[5] . We can also use FFmpeg[6] . this part is pretty straightforward, shouldn't take more than a day or two to write, if you're serious about making this OP, I'd be down to do it with you :)
f***, this sounds cool. Never heard of the project. Does anybody have experience with it? Any downsides? Like higher latency than you would expect on a micro controller or something?
No, but vagrant would.
You are correct, I run into this issue all the time.

How would the program know where my files are saved?
Wait a second, it was now 7 years ago that I bothered with this stuff. "self" in python is in many ways similar to "this" in C++, in that it let's you call methods and attributes inside of an object, but it is not a pointer or reference to the object you're in, you can not pass "self" to the outside. I am actually no longer sure what it really is.
This may sound silly but if the website **only a simple web page**, you can use excel web query. There's no need to install python, pip, virtualenv, request, beautifousoup/scrapy, and xlrd/xlwt. in excel 2003, it is in data --&gt; import external data --&gt; web query. edit: Just don't abuse excel(and vba). If things (your requirement) become complicated don't forget to consider python again. in excel 2013(maybe 2007+), data --&gt; from web. 
do you already use pep8 and pylint?

Great resource, thank you for sharing
This is a big selling point for pycharm. Its information is far from perfect (because python), but it can infer quite a lot from what constructors are used, it does parse reStructuredText and epytext type documentation (and soon PEP 484 type hints), and it can [collect type information from the debugger](http://blog.jetbrains.com/pycharm/2013/02/dynamic-runtime-type-inference-in-pycharm-2-7/) at runtime (though that will make you run slooooow). ...and while I do find all that useful, very often the answer is "run it in shell_plus or add a breakpoint in the debugger and see what it returns."
I'm not sure that's true. Ruby's gems for distribution and bundler for dependency management seem exceptional here: lots of gems have native code. They compile it during install.
Good question it is probably a Windows issue. Last I knew a 64 bit Python works fine and actually gives you some advantages. Hopefully someone can chime in here. 
I have some experience with it. I have [this board](https://micropython.org/store/#/products/PYBv1_0), and I have backed the [WiPy Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/wipy/the-wipy-the-internet-of-things-taken-to-the-next/description) campaign. I have experience with Arduino and Raspberry Pi. Arduino is good, because it's low power and instant on, but I am not as efficient with the language. Raspberry Pi is good because I can script with Python, but it requires an OS to boot up and uses more power. A microcontroller that runs MicroPython is the perfect balance! I can run python scripts on a low powered board that is instantly on. In my limited experience with MicroPython, I have not seen any sort of latency issues. Everything works as expected. The only downsides that I can think of are the comparatively small community, which is growing, and the lack of libraries. As for the libraries, I have not yet needed anything that isn't available, but I wonder if I would ever want something like numpy.
Thats exactly what I think. I think PEX is a pretty interessting project but docker solves all this problems for me. I can install whatever extensions and devlibs I want and dont even need to think about virtualenvs. The official Python docker images are awesome with their ONBUILD feature of installings all deps from requirements.txt while building the container.
There's nothing wrong with the 64 bit version. Everything works fine. [You can find 64 bit versions of precompiled binary packages](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/). The python.org page offers the 32 bit version as the default because that will work for everyone. Go to the full download page if you want to choose for yourself. However, there's a good reason to choose the 32 bit version. Python data structures are pointer-heavy, which means you pay a significant price for the fact that 64 bit pointers are twice as wide. Compare: &gt;&gt;&gt; for T in int, float, tuple, list, set, dict: print(sys.getsizeof(T())) 12 16 28 36 116 148 Against: &gt;&gt;&gt; for T in int, float, tuple, list, set, dict: print(sys.getsizeof(T())) 24 24 48 64 224 288 The same data takes roughly twice the memory using the 64 bit version. (These figures are for empty data structures; the picture changes a little bit for fully populated data structures, but there's still a significant cost.) This is one of the reasons I actually prefer Windows over Linux — I have a choice of what flavor to use. If you install a 64 bit Linux distro, you're stuck with a 64 bit version of Python, because that's the only flavor packaged. You would have to build it yourself from source, or use some third-party distribution if you want that, but being able to use your distro's package management system for everything is one of the main advantages of Linux, which you are giving up. 
I dont like braces... So #1
I love Bottle. Everything you need is included in a single Python file. Source code is easy to read and modify. Its lovely API is well-documented. Template engine and development server is really useful. I'm moving from Flask to Bottle. It's faster. I'll use Bottle for web interface of a Windows program, and for a public-facing web app. Single file makes it super easy to deploy in such situations. Unless you need tons of Flask extensions, you would probably want to use Bottle.
same !
**You** tell the program where your files are saved.
look at raw_input() and exit()
I'm aware of the issue. Imports seem to work fine on python3 (for whatever reason) but not on python2. I'm new to PyPI (first package submitted) so I'm not sure how long this will persist or how to go about fixing it. If you have an idea, please contribute to the project, or make an issue!
&gt; For not running sudo when installing packages and targeting a specific Python version rather than relying on or overwriting the default. So, virtualenv?
Well, it was asked what the point of a Venv inside Docker was.
It's 4000 lines of code in one file, not exactly lightweight and modular. (For reference, Flask is about 6000, but has the added Werkzeug dependency). I haven't used Bottle, but it being in one source file is not a very good argument. You could write a full fledged operating system in one file if you absolutely wanted to, but it would be a logistical nightmare. If your deployments depend on Bottle being in a single file for simplicity, I'm assuming you're deploying it directly. That means no package management, which again means no clear upgrade path if there's a security problem (as opposed to something like `pip install -U bottle &amp;&amp; supervisorctl restart app` or something, no matter what version of Bottle your app might run). Your deployments have to handle external dependencies. Bottle still might be great but not for those reasons.
Oh.. I see my reading circuits need more caffeine.
Does anyone know how this compares to webpy? I used webpy to write a (simple) webapp recently. I've been looking into flask for the benefits of plugins. Haven't looked at bottle at all.
And many style guides outright forbid this in languages that support it
The script would presumably take the name parameter from the URL. So if you went to http://localhost:8080/hello/John the result would be 'Hello John!'.
Ah cool! So the &lt;name&gt; value is what's executed with index(name) correct? Hence server/hello/world returns the value in the page content?
I have a teensy bit of experience with Flask: "{{name}}" appears to come from the Jinja 2 templating format. Also, it returns world because they navigated to "local host:8080/hello/world" it's taking "world" in the url as the "&lt;name&gt;" argument in the route! So, if you went to "/hello/Dolly" it would return "Dolly" on the page. Hope that helps to (briefly) clarify.
If you are curious to how it works behind the scenes. You might want to read up on Decorators and if you get that then read these [two](http://ains.co/blog/things-which-arent-magic-flask-part-1.html) [articles](http://ains.co/blog/things-which-arent-magic-flask-part-2.html) (especially Part 2, which goes in on the `&lt;name&gt;` part.) Note: this is about Flask, but the route decorator looks very much the same.
Mainly because it's so much easier to redistribute that way. Better to `pip install slog` than to have to download and copy into either your `site-packages` (probably not a great idea) or into every project directory you'll use it in (but that's just my opinion, and I'm pretty new to implementing packaging in Python!) I'll admit I probably should've done more research into it. Thanks for the pointer, I'll implement an `init.py` later today!
I'm not sure whether it will work in Jython, but try this answer: http://stackoverflow.com/a/12179724
I know about .format and the older % methods. I didn't understand where "world" was coming from is all, but then it all made sense thanks to your post and another regarding decorators. The syntax used in the bottle example is really odd to me though, why is name inside two curly brackets, why is .format omitted. All of these non-verbose things &gt;:)
I really like working with Bottle, but I've only used it internally. I remember reading, a while back, that it doesn't hold up under heavier loads and that it's a good idea to wrap it in something like Rocket. Does anyone have any experience with using Bottle in production? How does it scale?
I always use Libre Office Draw: runs on all platforms, free, and easy to use. But, not sure if it would look polished enough for you.
I'll give it a go. Thanks!
I believe bottle uses jinja2 for its templates. Just another templating library (and a very good one). 
http://www.graphviz.org/Gallery.php
Yeah, I've considered using Rocket: from rocket import Rocket from bottle import Bottle from bottle import route app = Bottle(__name__) app.debug = True @app.route('/') def hello(): return '&lt;p&gt;Hello, Bottle &amp; Rocket!&lt;/p&gt;' def run_server(): server = Rocket( interfaces=('0.0.0.0', 8000), method='wsgi', app_info={'wsgi_app': app}) server.start() if __name__ == '__main__': run_server() https://pypi.python.org/pypi/rocket
I use bottle for prototyping and standing up small-scale webapps on a regular basis. It's pretty awesome, and I love it because I can start playing with a running, local prototype just minutes after I stand up a repository. I have run into issues when the prototypes pulled in requirements that didn't have great support. It's a small framework, and is much less "batteries included" than something like Django or most "on rails" frameworks. This can be fun for learning purposes, but it's not as fun when you have to home-build some features on a deadline. In other words: Before picking this up for a serious project, figure out if it meets your needs. It's tons of fun, but it's less fully-featured than many popular web frameworks.
Well your syntax is wrong to start. Assignment in while is invalid. When that's fixed it just runs an infinite loop. The problem is not with python but rather with the editor I suppose. I never used IDLE so I have no idea how it behaves. Even running the wrongly syntaxed file, it just directly throws a SyntaxError.
I think the argument is that you can use it by dropping a single file into your project, but to me that's sorta bad. You should install your dependencies via pip, and updating them should be a matter of running pip instead of having to overwrite a file in your project's directory. Like....you'd never copy all of flask into your project in order to use it.
At the time this thing was written, there was official documentation saying it was going to be removed, which was backed off from. 
I was ultimately just trying to determine what could possibly be in session_key when I access it, and it was more of a general exercise so that I could use it on other things. Seems like you found it much quicker than my attempt and that probably comes with experience but it still requires a lot of steps so I was hoping there was a tool to help me figure out the possible types of values I could be given back when calling something. I suppose it just doesn't work that way in declarative languages though. I've heard of Flask and how it's much simpler but I think ultimately I want a batteries-included web framework. Anyway thanks for your help and detailed reply, it's very helpful and I'll hopefully not get so off course when digging in the future. Or I'll just avoid digging as nothing is so absolute in declarative languages.
Definitely +1 for PyCharm, I'm just past my 1 month trial and the free version doesn't have Django support so I'm sticking with SublimeText for now. The runtime type info collection sounds excellent though and pretty much looks like what I was looking for. I may buy PyCharm at some point in the future when I can justify the purchase to myself and such features certainly help.
This is fascinating. Think I'll check it out over the weekend.
It's a selling point because maintenance is not your problem. Being able to quickly embed the library in your own app without worrying about package management is pretty cool since Python's own packaging ecosystem is a bit of a mess.
Why the downvote?
Simplicity. I use it when I want to get a microservice up in 5 minutes on a server where I don't have root. I don't need use pip or pyenv. I don't have to worry whether the server only has Python 2 or 3--it works with both. I just need a directory with two files: `bottle.py` and `__main__.py` and it works. This simplicity carries into the API, so that when creating my webservice, all I need to do is use a simple decorator and I've got the route setup. It's not the tool for every job. I wouldn't use it on anything that needed to scale. But, as a dead simple tool for creating a sqlite-backed crud webservice, it's hard to beat. EDIT: As far as a security upgrade, it's `cd` and `wget`. Not a problem if you aren't trying to build a large scale service.
Well to be honest setting up a venv even without root takes 1min, download venv - unpack run. Hell... you could have written a 5 line shell script to automate that if 1min is too much of a hassle ;-) You are trading good practice for... I'd say convenience but I'm not sure if there is even that, pyramid can be operated as a microframework and work as a single file solution, same with flask. In my opinion doing things right is always better than doing them fast.
Yeah, that's *exactly* what i think.
say it with me: 'Read the docs!'
It's not that venv is a hassle to get set up, it's that I often experience venvs breaking when the system python package gets updated. I have a venv for doing data work with IPython that I have to fix every few months because some update has broken something. Not every time, but often. It's an inconvenience. Using Bottle, venv is happily unnecessary. And, despite not following "good practice", the Bottle.py code was sufficiently maintainable to have full Python3 support, [unlike the current release version of Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/advanced_foreword/#the-status-of-python-3).
I use pyramid myself (one of the first "main" frameworks to support py3 fully), flask is a bit "special" in this regard yeah ;-) Can't say I've experienced venvs breaking unless you do a main distro release upgrade.
Lol yeah but then sometimes they blow up on you out of nowhere :)
How involved are you getting with the database? I'm still using SQL queries in python with `mysql.connector`. I've got a cross between liking the bare metal of it, and not having outgrown it yet. Anyway, /r/Python is for news and releases. Try asking questions over at /r/learnpython, which is for them, despite the name.
I find the best technical solution is to curse and swear until the code starts working about 25% towards what you want it to do and 25% towards framework can do, or 15 hours, whichever comes first.
If your application is database intensive, then I think it makes sense to use an ORM system. SQLAlchemy is pretty powerful, well maintained and has been around for a while. If you decide to go with SQLAlchemy keep in mind that there are two layers: Core and ORM. From SQLAlchemy [website](http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/faq/performance.html#i-m-inserting-400-000-rows-with-the-orm-and-it-s-really-slow): *ORMs are basically not intended for high-performance bulk inserts - this is the whole reason SQLAlchemy offers the Core in addition to the ORM as a first-class component.* Thus for performance reason you may want to use Core when applicable. I think documentation is pretty extensive, I would suggest that you spend some time beforehand reading about relationship management and loading http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/orm/relationships.html, http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/orm/loading_relationships.html For help you can go to https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/sqlalchemy, questions posted there are often answered by the author [Mike Bayer](http://techspot.zzzeek.org/) There is a list of recipes available here: https://bitbucket.org/zzzeek/sqlalchemy/wiki/UsageRecipes One of the things that I find lacking from SQLAlchemy is out-of-box support for master-slave set up with read-write master and few read-only replicas, although there is a recipe to emulate Django style routing http://techspot.zzzeek.org/2012/01/11/django-style-database-routers-in-sqlalchemy/ There is also Django ORM, don't have much experience with it to share. 
Just bought James Ma Weiming's new book 'Mastering Python for Finance' because of this post. Will review when I finish it.
wow... this is nasty and beautiful at the same time
The last option is the best. You can break that list up to multiple lines if the length is bothering you. It's not difficult to notice the variable in there if you use an editor with syntax highlighting. Guido has signaled in the past that he disliked implicit concatenation and would like to deprecate it somewhere way down the line. Appending to strings is unpythonic largely due to the way strings work in Python. Since they immutable, this recreates the string several times. 
Ah, yes, that does indeed look like the best solution. I still don't quite like the variable in there, but the syntax highlighting does help some. Thanks (and to /u/fandingo) for politely pointing out the obvious solution :)
Well it has changed since it was published, but % is now considered bad practice
Yep- but as you know, we can specify which platforms (linux + os x) to include deps for. In fact- here's the commit[1] where I updated the docs the other day! We do this for our Apache Aurora client so the same pex file works on developer laptops (OS X) and our Linux workstations. https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/commit/3dbe35bdeb3be24cbc48484ed096cee8b8af34e9
Yep, the goal is that it's all self-contained- you can move the .pex file (what is a zip) anywhere on the filesystem and execute it (we do it all the time)
We haven't used it with conda, so you'd definitely be forging new ground.
Could you name a few, I'm genuinely curious. And actually it might not be considered bad practice, looks like my info was faulty
I've got a working switch/case in Python that is a follow-on to http://www.dr-josiah.com/2012/04/python-bytecode-hacks-gotos-revisited.html , but the valid Python syntax is ugly as hell (though I did get it working in Python 2.6, 2.7, and 3.4 last summer), and has a terribly dirty implementation (that is no faster than the dictionary + function lookup and call).
Are you sure the environment variable exists in the environment the script is running in? Try printing the variable from within the script.
&gt; Use True and False rather than 1 and 0 Why?
&gt; logs that have info what do you mean by this ?
Tornado and Flask are not really designed for each other: http://www.tornadoweb.org/en/branch2.4/wsgi.html &gt;Since no asynchronous methods are available for WSGI applications, the httpclient and auth modules are both not available for WSGI applications. We support the same interface, but handlers running in a WSGIApplication do not support flush() or asynchronous methods. Tornado will happily power a wsgi app, but you're probably better off using a pre-fork server like apache to power the app and rely on javascript (Yeah! Like Node!) for your async work, client-side. Annecdotally, I've been *testing* a Flask app under tornado (because apache configs are for the birds) for a while now and been impressed with the performance. But again, all my async actions are performed through JS.
This EdX course just got started a few weeks back.. https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-big-data-apache-spark-uc-berkeleyx-cs100-1x
Explicit is better than implicit.
I enjoyed seeing the data. Thanks for that. But, why in the world did the author decide to use the ratio `python3 / (python2 + unknown)` and then notate that as a percent?? Just make it `python3 / (python2 + unknown + python3)` and we're set. I could even look past the weird notation if they hadn't gone on to asses Guido's "majority of new projects" goal with a 50 *'%'* cutoff.
Personally much easier is to write code for Python 3 then add: from __future__ import absolute_import, division, print_function, unicode_literals on top and use [six package](http://pythonhosted.org/six/) to fix compatibility for remaining parts (renamed functions and packages). This approach allows for a straight forward way to write code that is compatible with both python 2.7 and 3.3+.
/r/forhire
Unicode is not hard. You just need to keep in mind the difference between characters and a bytes and treat them as distinct types. - You need to show message to user? You use characters - You need to send/save text in binary (send over network, save a file) you need to encode it. To convert characters to bytes, you use encode(). To convert from bytes to characters, you use decode(). What encoding to use? Unless you have special requirements, always use utf-8. Many libraries will try to be helpful and do the encoding/decoding to you. Which probably the reason why it makes things more confusing. When you want to write code that works on Python 2.7 and Python 3.3+ write it in Python 3. Then once you finish, add: from __future__ import absolute_import, division, print_function, unicode_literals on top of every source file, and use six module to handle other incompatibilities.
I think that, to be fair, it doesn't make much sense to just import some model fields from peewee. The core of peewee (peewee.py) contains only the code necessary to construct models of tables and execute queries. There is a whole slew of extensions included in the `playhouse` set of modules that have extra functionality, but really everything in `peewee.py` has its place.
The former at least has precedence from other languages.
I have to admit that I am also one of those people who use the plain old `%` operator 95% of the time. I have to admit that I like the way how `format` works better and it may be easier to read. However, the way `format` is implemented makes it simply computationally more expensive. In many tasks it probably doesn't matter but in some it does. For example, %timeit -n 1000 ['test %d' % i for i in range(1000)] 1000 loops, best of 3: 480 µs per loop %timeit -n 1000 ['test {}'.format(i) for i in range(1000)] 1000 loops, best of 3: 813 µs per loop
Don't other user's ptys get chown'd to them on login?
In C++ under the hood, "this" is always the first argument to a member function, but the C++ compiler hides this. But if you would get a decompiler you would see this. While in python it is not hidden, but part of the implementation. You can pass a python self to the outside. If you have a python class outside = None Class A(object): def __init__(self): self.a = 99 outside = self a = A() Outside and a should be equal.
Yup - this is probably one of the reasons it requires to be run as root
There is the [Openhatch](https://github.com/openhatch/oh-mainline/issues) project which is probably the most contributor friendly project that I know of. Besides the properly tagged issue tracker they have a pretty active IRC channel on Freenode at #openhatch. They also maintain a list of projects that are looking for contributors. Here's a [list of Python projects](http://openhatch.org/search/?q=&amp;language=Python) on there.
When I try that out, outside is still None.
yep, http://imdbpy.sourceforge.net/support.html#documentation ia = imdb.IMDb() s_result = ia.search_movie('The Untouchables') 
That's brilliant, well done. 
Okay, so i tried BeautifulSoup too, it doesnt work either. same crash!
I've narrowed it down, almost all the link extractor libraries use urllib2 as such: request = urllib2.Request("http://www.gpsbasecamp.com/national-parks") This somehow fails if you do this inside another process and you import PyQt4
yeap..i even tried it on requests. Doesn't work either. same insane crash. this is fucking retarded..does this mean I have to ditch PyQt and use Tkinter. 
Noob q: 32 bit python isn't compatible with 64 bit native libraries right?
This is great. Thanks.
If you don't set the terminal, and you have access to someone's machine for a few minutes, you can do this without root. Obviously you need access to their machine, but not root. Also even if you DO have root, this won't work if they're using X11 and a terminal emulator
That's actually exactly what I'm looking for. Cheers.
Your problem is not related to pyquery, beautifulsoup and requests but incorrect PyQt usage. PyQt application must contain instance of QApplication, even if it's console application (without GUI). Start with the simplest working "Hello world" PyQt application, then add some more functionality. Try something like this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10641055/using-pyqt-for-a-command-prompt-python-program
About time ! I guess I'm glad this didn't happen years ago or I'd never have worked on shoebot. [EDIT] Anybody on linux that likes the idea of something like this that works with livecoding, might want to try shoebot :) [/EDIT]
Looks interesting. I'll try to dive in when I get some time. I don't really have much experience in desktop apps or scientific computing. But I'm looking to learn. As far as 2 vs 3 goes, I'm open to both.
Thanks. Openhatch looks interesting. That list is a bit overwhelming though. 
Well, you can't use /dev/tty*. Maybe something else might work. *fuck i'm an idiot* It's /dev/pts/&lt;some number&gt; `who` won't show it directly, but `ls -l /dev/pts/` will. Like the tty's, they are chowned to the user, so you still need to have root. Edit: /dev/tty*, not just /dev/tty
I know the [CherryPy](http://www.cherrypy.org/) project is quite in dire need for new contributors. See this [post](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/cherrypy-users/lT1cxovGyy8/JKCPrE51CXIJ) for instance.
This is the biggest thing to happen to Python this year. Huge.
I think /u/WontForgetLogin is looking for a small project. NetwokX is quite huge in my opinion.
This sounds sketchy as hell. Just reading the description at least. 
First one is integer, the second one is long integer - thus the `L` at the end. &gt;&gt;&gt; import sys &gt;&gt;&gt; type(sys.maxint) &lt;type 'int'&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; type(sys.maxint+1) &lt;type 'long'&gt; https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#numeric-types-int-float-long-complex
sys.maxint is basically the size of a 64 bit integer (on 32 bit platforms, it'll be 32 bits). That's the size that your computer can work with natively - performing adds / multiplies etc in a single operation. However, just because that's what can be done in a single operation doesn't mean you can't go beyond that by making things more complicated. You just perform the extra steps in software, chaining together multiple values to represent it. There exist libraries for this in many languages - python just supports this type of integer natively, and handles the details of the implementation transparently. Eg. once the size goes beyong 2^64, you can allocate a bigger chunk of memory - 16 bytes, rather than the 8 for a single 64 bit value, say. The high bits get stored in the first, and the low bits in the second. When you want to add 2 of these together, you basically do the same thing you'd do when you add numbers on paper: 1. First add the two low bit values together. The result becomes the new low-bits of the number. 2. If there was an overflow (ie. the result was bigger than 2^64), then note that you need to carry an extra 1 to the high bits. 3. Now add the two high-bit values together. Add 1 if we need to carry from the low bits. 4. If this overflows as well, we've exceeded the 128 bits we allocated. So enlarge the memory we're using again (eg. to 192 bits), and store 1 in the new high-bits. And so on. There are a few additional complications around signedness, and multiplication is a bit more complex, as python uses a more advanced algorithm than the naive one for that, but that's the basic idea. Just as it'll add more memory when you append to a list beyond what it can store, it'll do the same when an integer gets too big to fit what was allocated for it. In python2, there was actually a noticable difference between native-length integers (ie &lt;64 bits) and "long integers" (ie. when it starts using extra words), though this has been minimised in recent versions to the point that it's mostly transparent (the difference is that the type will be "long", rather than "int", and an "L" suffix is appended to the `repr`). In python3, the distinction vanishes completely, with all this handled behind the scenes without leaking the details of how it's actually being stored to the user.
/r/Python is for news and releases. /r/learnpython is for questions, despite the name. I'd recommend you post over there; you may get a wider range of answers.
I have added now documents to https://py3traits.readthedocs.org/en/latest/ with also example of use. Will improve, but hearing comments would be appreciated too.
I recommend pyprocessing instead. It isn't as complete in functionality, but you don't need java or the Processing environment. It's OpenGL and Pyglet based (so multi platform). https://code.google.com/p/pyprocessing/
Imagine you had a computer that couldn't store any numbers bigger than 9. You could still represent bigger numbers, by storing a bunch of those digits, and interpreting them as a base-10 number. So if you want to store the number "531", you store `[5, 3, 1]`. You can do math with these digit strings the same way you'd do it by hand on paper. Python does the same thing to store its numbers. `sys.maxint` is the biggest number that the computer can hold, but Python can represent bigger numbers by storing a bunch of those numbers in a row, in a base-9223372036854775808 number.

Sympy is also a very cool tool. Used it a fair bit back in grad school for symbolic math.

I work at edX, and while our project is likely bigger than one you're interested in hacking on, we are always looking for more contributors. We know our onboarding for new people isn't great but we're always looking to improve it. See https://github.com/edx/edx-platform/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst for more details, and feel free to reach out to us on our IRC channel or mailing list. A great place to get started with Open edX is our byte-sized bugs &amp; tasks list: https://github.com/edx/edx-platform/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst#byte-sized-tasks--bugs
No, Django is way overkill for this project. I just need to write some code that runs in a main loop and gets data from that library (yowsup2) and then do SQL INSERT on a database with the data I get from yowsup2. There's no web frontend for this work, it's purely backend code with no frontend.
Yes, it's going to be database intensive. I'm not sure I want to go with Django ORM as that's too tied to Django and I'm not going to be using the rest of Django at all. SQLAlchemy looks good but the syntax is too confusing.
Thanks, very well explained 
It would have been nice if the Python were clearer and more readable, instead of perpetuating the impression that programming is arcane and impenetrable.
"Learning Python, 5th Edition" does the trick. You might need 1 extra more than some comparing to other resources but you will save it in the long run. Most tutorials out there are incomplete. Also please learn python 3. NOTE. It would help to know some basic coding terms before you start this book
Seems pretty readable to me, they used a bunch class and looks like a nice use of format strings 
It uses a pointless """ sequence. This triggers me.
Processing is an awesome environment for interactive audio/visual applets and doing data visualization. Unfortunately, the language you have to use is Java (actually a simplified version of Java). This lets you use Python instead. That's all. My question is whether the Python version will perform as well as the Java version. Whatever else you can say about Java, it's fast, which matters when you have a ton of visual thingies to track and update.
&gt; What sort of error are you expecting? not passing in arg "x" when called (at foo.method()) 
 &gt; In python3, the distinction vanishes completely To be more precise: in python3 the native int object vanishes completely. Every int in python3 is a "bignum" integer.
I have a question here, I'd appreciate if you guys can enlighten me somehow. Is contributions to open source projects competitive? In other words, let's say my contribution (while following the project's protocol and guidelines) doesn't get approval of the maintainers. Would that hurt my reputation? I find contributing to open source projects very timid to be honest. And there is always someone better than me out there, which also doesn't help with my confidence in even starting to fix the issues.
I've so far run MySQL and `mysql.connector` exclusively on Py2.7, Windows x64, and vanilla MySQL. I could go ahead and google around for you, or download Maria and Arch to test for you, but I would say that you'd be better off doing that yourself. Getting your fingers mucky is pretty much the whole point of Python, and programming as a whole. :D
Is it a jython thing ?
People are generally taught not to use `+` or `+=` for strings in Python as it results in a copy, and gets exponentially slower as you do more. The idiomatic way to do this is either with `%` or `.format` (or if you need to join lots of strings, `.append()` to a list, and then call `''.join()` on the list). Listcomps are pretty fast too. It might not matter that much in this case but it means you'll have to refactor once you add more things to that string at a later date.
This is a really cool fact about functions, which is that they are descriptors. You can read Raymond Hettinger's [discussion](https://docs.python.org/2/howto/descriptor.html#functions-and-methods) for a good explanation. The basic idea is this: Say you define a class `Foo`: class Foo: x = 42 When we access `Foo.x`, python looks in the "class dictionary", `Foo.__dict__`, for `x` and returns its value: &gt;&gt;&gt; Foo.x 42 &gt;&gt;&gt; Foo.__dict__['x'] 42 But in fact, it isn't quite so simple. Python has these things called *descriptors*, which are objects implementing methods describing some special behavior that should occur whenever they are looked up as attributes of a class. One special method is `__get__`. Here's a sample descriptor: class Descriptor: def __get__(self, obj, type_): print('I am being accessed from {}!'.format(type_)) return 42 Now if we add this descriptor to a class: class Foo: x = Descriptor() and we try to access the attribute `x`, we find that a message is printed: &gt;&gt;&gt; Foo.x I am being accessed from &lt;class '__main__.Foo'&gt;! 42 It turns out that function objects in python are in fact descriptors. You can define a function and check that the resulting object has a `__get__` method: &gt;&gt;&gt; def foo(): pass &gt;&gt;&gt; foo.__get__ &lt;method-wrapper '__get__' of function object at 0x1029a6b70&gt; Whenever this function is accessed as an attribute of a class, this `__get__` method is called. As you might guess, the purpose of this method is to fill in the first argument of `foo` with the instance of the class it is being accessed from. And that's why no error occurs in the above example.
I *think* he is talking about unicode *source files* on Windows and not writing code to handle unicode. At least, it's hard to tell...
Would've been cooler if they'd displayed it on an e-ink display with a button that ran the code.
Not OP. But is there a list of projects that are open to Python3 porting and need help? I'm currently working on porting [Splash](https://github.com/scrapinghub/splash) to Python 3 and have ported one or two Twisted modules in the past. I think I like porting stuff, would love to do more. :D
I may be wrong, but I think that Go at least (and I think the others too?) create binaries that are platform specific anyways.
It's Qt, not QT.
I'll be developing on Arch Linux. Right, I agree, I'll do some Googling, thanks :-)
I feel a little cautious about all the optimism about coding that is seen in the media these days. Its great if someone wants to learn how to code and I like that more people like it. But I do not feel very good how it is showcased as some sort of skill you cannot personally do without. Every job is not going to involve coding. The super emphasis on it feels wrong, like some sort of skill that makes you a superman. 
Oh yeah. I've already seen a lot of it in the past year or so. I wincingly remember this (see the video if you haven't) from a bit over a year ago from the UK: http://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/02/11/coding_in_schools_madness/
You shouldn't feel a little cautious. You should feel somewhat annoyed. It is a really dumb idea, and smart people ought to know better. But when it comes to technology, which many consider a kind of magic, sometimes it seems they'll swallow anything.
Spacing is off, isn't it? I thought ~~functions~~ methods were required to have 2 newlines in between.
It's not a function, just an if block. pylint would complain about the global variable name "bbw" not being capitalized though.
Yeah annoyed was probably the right word. Also cautious also works. I don't know if assuming that the tech field is where the entirety of job creation will happen in the future is such a good idea. Also problem solving and critical thinking are important part of coding but those are skills but coding is not the only place to find them. Telling kids that they only need to understand syntaxes, how to write a website and other domain specific skills and then they will be set for life sends the wrong message. Coding is too narrow a cross section to focus so much attention on. Encouraging kids to be more scientific, rational, to encourage critical thinking is enough. 
That's the standard for the docstring.
I just finished reading this (very long) article. It doesnt advocate that everyone should learn to code. Rather, it aims to explain to middle managers the culture of programming. 
2 lines in between for top level functions and classes only. Class methods can have only 1 newline between. [PEP8 section in question.](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#blank-lines)
Oh that's not exactly a bad thing. My comment still stands though. I think there is still a trend growing in society that coding is the perfect career for every kid. If only they started coding, everything else in their career will fall into place. 
It is confusing, but I believe windows is using UTF-8 as default for editors, so the decode() acrobatic is unnecessary. At worst, he could specify encoding like suggested here: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0263/ After that python will internally encode strings to its internal unicode format and the only time you need to worry about encoding, when you need communicate externally of your program with something that works on bytes instead of characters. I responded primarily because /u/billsil is rather confusing and can introduce bad habits. To properly write code that uses unicode it is important to understand the difference between a character and a byte similarly how we distinguish integer from floating number, or even better, a number vs string containing a number.
Why?
These pieces are basically the same thing. In fact, the author of the article you linked wrote the code for the cover in question.
Thanks, just the info I was looking for. Just wanted to make sure I wouldn't run into any unforeseen issues. I guess the only big downside to an Anaconda install is that it runs ~900mb for the large install. But if that's a huge issue, they produce miniconda too. Anyways, thanks again for the input!
I can't exactly make it out but I see a bunch of TODOs so I'm guessing they took it straight from a production system.
Maybe, but I'm continually surprised by people I went to school with, who do not have "tech" jobs, talking about coding. I really think it's going to continue to be adopted by more and more diverse roles.
You are of course correct but I believe it is important to note that Python's long is not the same as long in other languages such as C. It is similar to for example BigNum in Java: Python 3.4.3 (default, Mar 27 2015, 02:30:53) [GCC] on linux Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information. &gt;&gt;&gt; import sys &gt;&gt;&gt; a = sys.maxsize ** 10000 &gt;&gt;&gt; a.bit_length() 630000 Also as of Python 3 there is no longer a distinction between integer types, from programmer point of view it behaves as if all integers are of long type.
last commit sept. 2012...
We should be happy that, in this huge essay that touches on nearly every aspect of programming, including the failings of many programming languages and programming communities, the part about Python is concluded with: "Python people, generally, are pretty cool."
Short answer: no. Long answer: you'd need to do something like compile Python down into JavaScript, somehow. Theoretically possible, but not practical.
Thanks for the answer.
Well, here's how I see it, personally. If everyone gave coding a shot, meaning ~2hrs a day for a week or two (beyond the initial environment setup, which they might need assistance with), worst case scenario, they'd learn more about computers. They'd develop an appreciation for the software they use. And for those who absolutely fall in love with it, they now know that they can improve their lives and potentially their workplace with some automation. Forcing people to learn beyond that, however, is a mistake. Society should promote awareness of different skills, not force them on anyone.
There is always someone out there who wants to help you be better than them. We need to carry each other forward. As for contributions being rejected, it's ok. Some of it's not rejection, just part of the review and collaboration process. I've had PRs rejected in favor of others or because it was out of scope for the project. There's always something new to hack on and its all part of the process. If people are mean or unfair, find a different project. There are good people out there.
I'm not arguing that everyone needs to learn the software engineering or computer science - but at the basic level - teaching programming requires neither of those and can still be useful - it's about interacting with a computer in a precise and general way - more than a GUI or CLI. Computers are already used in every profession and that trend isn't going to slow down, you will be spending more and more time interacting with a computer to do your job - so you might as well learn how to interact with it more efficiently. Stuff like writing plugins for the software you use to automate things (eg. plugins for various editors from CAD software to design stuff), aggregating and transforming data for analysis (eg. excel and the likes), etc. doesn't require a broad knowledge of programming, is mostly domain specific and can be explained in few tutorials if the person understands the basics like control flow and variables. Really it's like saying we shouldn't be teaching elementary algebra because because most people don't need to know stuff like linear algebra. The point is to give you the tools for every day use and to give you a foundation on which you can build if you do need it - the same is true for programming - you don't need to teach algorithms or design patterns to everyone but teaching people the basics of programming will allow them to least have a vague understanding of what it means to program something and recognize when they can apply it.
Are you just asking for google chrome or browsers in general? If your'e talking about chrome only - you can find many [python apps on google chrome store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/python/nodpmmidbgeganfponihbgmfcoiibffi) - basically you can compile CPython [to chrome NACL](https://chromium.googlesource.com/external/naclports/+/master/ports/python3) so you get working CPython interpreter inside of chrome. 
What IS Processing? The web page is extremely vague... 
The class object is utterly pointless. It accepts any parameter and injects it as a property simply for the purpose of obfuscating the outputted string. A function would be more than satisfactory and in fact be more readable. I get that it is trying to make a point but I don't think it should be showcased as an example of why people ought to learn how to code. I think a cooler example of why to learn code would be to scrape all the front page articles of bloomberg and find the number of occurrences where programming in some form was showcased, whether it was an article about Microsoft or Facebook or whatever. At least showcase something functional and useful.
Yes it is. From: https://github.com/jdf/processing.py *I was only able to do it at all thanks to the brilliant and beautiful Jython project.*
[pypy.js](http://pypyjs.org/) runs fine on chrome. It takes a bit of time to load but works well. 
Look at the Python module called dataset. It's a very easy to use wrapper around SQLAlchemy.
Thank you guys. I've had the same thoughts, I just wasn't sure if my relative naivety to python coding was causing me to miss something, and before I sort of committed one way or the other, I wanted to get some feedback.
As a career, no. But understanding some basic code could be of value to virtually anyone, especially in the near future as technology becomes even more abundant.
It's a reaction to the high wages in Silicon Valley and NYC, I think. The business community wants to drag down those wages. This is behind some of the movements to get coding taught at an early age in schools and to open the floodgates to immigration (Mark Zuckerberg is behind that one), and several other movements with money behind them clearly intended to increase the number of programmers.
I'd also say that there's a wide range of programming skill. Certainly, not everyone needs to be able to code a computer game or an email client. But lots of people would benefit from a very basic level of being able to write a short script to do some manipulations on a spreadsheet that Excel can't do (or which is a pain in Excel), for instance. 
Hi. I'm the author of Python Mode for processing, a.k.a processing.py. I'll answer any questions about it here, if there are any.
Youbare under the assumption that all class systems should follow the python/C++/Java way of doing things. That is a false assumption. If you ever played with scheme, classes are not part of the language. But you can make classes in scheme that appear to be part of the language. This is because of the scheme macro system works. So for chicken scheme there are close to 8+ class systems inplemented or you could roll out your own. Each of those class inplementations is much different then C++/python. Under the hood, javascript is actually a functional language like scheme as opposed to procedural. Everything in javaacript is a function. Another problem is javascript used C++/Java terms to describe some of its things. The "this" is not supposed to be the same thing as a C++ "this" but you inherently think it is. http://wiki.call-cc.org/chicken-projects/egg-index-4.html#category-list
Pros: - Multiple environments, all separate from each other and your system python. - Easy package install, installing binaries when available (no compiling needed). - You can still fall back on pip to install into the environment if the package isn't available to conda. - Packages installed to multiple environments are hard-linked, saving space (i.e. if you have two environments with the same packages, the second one takes up no space). Cons: - By default it includes a ton of packages so it takes up a good amount of space. Install miniconda instead of anaconda to get around this. You can later install any specific packages you want.
It's neat when you realize you can access it via `Class.__doc__` or `func.__doc__` (or, preferably, `inspect.getdoc`).
Half of the early bird tickets have now been sold, be sure to register and pay to take advantage of the early bird prices.
Thats fair.
*Only* magazine covers have migrated to Python 3.
I'm having trouble figuring out what this is. It looks like you're thinking of P5 as an API, rather than a programming language. And you've implemented that API in Python. Am I correct? If so, wouldn't it make more sense to call it "The Processing API in Python"?
&gt; After creating a singleton, data it is holding should not be changed. I wonder why that is a policy. I [noticed](https://py3traits.readthedocs.org/en/latest/reference/pytraits.html) this code and wonder if it is Python 2.7: @type_safe def check(value: int, answer: bool, anything): return value, answer, anything 
what exactly is difference between functions and methods? method is a function, but associated with a class?
I'm making a chrome extension that uses PyPyjs, and it loads pretty much instantly if you're not loading it from an http server
A functional language need only have first class functions. lambda calculus doesn't even have a concept of arrays.
I meant /dev/tty*, as in any of the numbered TTY files. I've fixed it.
hey add me in... ramesh7128@gmail.com 
You have to do what other people have written for you. It's the difference between being able to read and being able to write. Take Python and take desktop Linux, which I use. My spreadsheet, LibreOffice, accepts code written in Python (which you can also do with Excel via 3rd party software). PostgreSQL can accept functions written in Python. My accounting program, GNUCash, has two APIs - C++ and Python. My desktop has a scripting framework that works with a few languages so far, including Python. This means I can script my IRC client, my IM client, and my Bittorrent client. I use Calibre to organize my ebooks, magazines and papers. It also can be scripted via Python and since it's written in Python, accepts Python plug-ins as well. I'm thinking of starting a blog - there are several static site generators written in Python that accept Python's ReStructured Text as input. There's a program that can basically replace your shell with Python! My reporting program is written in Java but I can add functions via Jython. My music organizer runs under Mono and uses Boo as its official plug-in language, which is basically statically typed Python. I can also use IronPython though. And that's just off the top of my head and those things which are only relevant to me. Python is used in many more products, from GIMP to most GIS tools. I'm involved in some fantasy sports handicapping contests. Now, like you said, I can accomplish things manually. But the ability to do ETL (Extract-Transform-Load) with Python, crunch data, automatically add my wagers and picks to spreadsheets and accounting software, make charts and even soon automatically add my selections to my own blog makes things a lot easier! Intuitive or not, one size does not fit all in clothes or software. Much software today is made to be extensible and those who can program will be able to take advantage of this and bend their software to their will. Eating out is nice, but sometimes the only way to get what you really want the way you want it is to cook it yourself. 
Why is it really dumb that people should learn what's becoming an essential skill today? &gt;which many consider a kind of magic, sometimes it seems they'll swallow &gt;anything. Thank you for proving my point. :-) Technology is not a kind of magic when everyone knows how to code. :-) 
&gt;A hair dresser will never need to code Yes, they will. Heck, one of the first coding assignments I had in college was modelling queues at a barber shop. :-) They can optimize their queueing system... create a reservation system... apply machine learning to determine the characteristics of the best-tipping customers. They can make GIMP plugins to help them show customers what their new hair cuts would look like. &gt; a firefighter will never need to code Firefighters work now with software developers to develop training simulations. &gt; a plumber will never need to code You can model pipes and plumbing systems. You can build Raspberry Pi-powered robots to crawl into sewer pipes for you. And there's always Mario. ;-) &gt; a lawyer will never need to code. Document management, text search, heck - I know a company now that makes 3D simulations so lawyers can show in court where person X was when car Y hit them and why driver Z should have seen them, etc. Sometimes they can even do things like prove whether sun might have been in someone's eyes at the moment in question! Your non-programming lawyers can't put the jury in the driver's seat on the date and time in question. &gt; I feel they are also coming close to perpetuating a notion of us lacking &gt;programmers, which simply isn't the case. So is this about preserving a fiefdom or what? We're surrounded by computers, and not knowing how to use them is like not knowing how to read. Let's not promote learned helplessness in the general population by scaring them away and telling them that we'll handle it all for them.
Nope! :)
You should use a syntax highlighting capable editor, and it will be much clearer. Here's one: http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/.

ITT: Short-sighted folks that cant hear the *automate-everything* train choo-choo'ing through a good number of soon-to-be obsolete careers. 
Sorry to hijack this a bit, but are there any books out there (or do any of the books in this list fit this criteria?) that aren't hands-on at all? That may sound odd, I know, but I'm currently working 'actively' on a lot of stuff right now, like doing the Python course on codecademy, doing problem sets in C for a CS course, doing stuff in Unity (using UnityScript or whatever it's called), and JavaScript, etc. and I feel like I've got more than enough 'lessons' to do and problems to work through. I'd just like something that I can sit back and read and maybe pick up one or two new things, or even just going over some concepts again, in a more theoretical and less practical way. Even if it's not specifically in Python and more about programming or computer science in general, that would be great too. I can completely understand why so many books are built around exercises and problem sets, and I think it's great that so many are, but I'm at a point now where I kinda don't want to pick up a book that wants me to install yet another VM Appliance or specific IDE or use specific libraries for the purpose of working through that book's 'course'. It seems like everything is trying to be the 'complete' course on whatever, so you have the videos to watch, the pdfs to read, the problem sets to do in the course-specific VM, etc. but I haven't found anything yet I can just sit back and relax to, if that makes any sense.
&gt; Anyway, as the presentation notes at end, if you start with a lightweight Flask you will need extra stuff to do anything, like SQL, forms, auth, session etc. By the time you got everything together you kinda assembled a Django again right? Except you had to bolt it together yourself with all pros/cons. I agree with this completely. But this presentation is from Kenneth Reitz, thats the reason I posted here so I can get opinion by other python experts here. (I am mostly a beginner)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2frH932U1g His video presentation.
I can't believe they didn't syntax highlight their cover, it would have looked a lot less stark.
and contrieved.
I see people trying to promote these other projects like Flask because of all the reasons given in the slides. But what I am always thinking, is that if I use these other projects, it just means I have to go and find other packages to do what the various parts of Django does. The down side is then I have to try and integrate them together. I can't count on someone else having doing the integration testing for all the components for me.
This is beyond terrible. 1. Your "password hashing" is a single iteration of SHA256 that's unsalted. This is horribly broken. Use pbkdf2 or bcrypt instead. 2. Are you really going to make a GET request to random.org everytime you need some random data? Use `os.urandom` instead.
Based on the idea that input validation is required somehow... what if the user called `Issue({'publish':malicious_callable})`? I mean, it clearly makes sense in the context of cover art, but I try to be a bit careful with star-args.
Please share your valuable views and suggestions 
It's a language that comes with lots of easy-to-use graphics APIs, and a rudimentary IDE for iteratively developing sketches in that language. The original Processing language is roughly Java, but instead of having to write ```static public void main(blah blah blah blah blah``` you just write ```ellipse(10, 10, 40, 70);``` and you get an oval.
As far as I know, ControlP5 works fine in Python Mode. See https://github.com/jdf/processing.py/issues/52.
&gt; but i talked about it with couple of people they said i should stick to one language and learn only about it Those people are idiots. Learn as many languages as you can. Each teaches you a different way to think about problems. Programming is one of the areas of life where *breadth* of technical knowledge is honestly more valuable than *depth* (depth of knowledge in *problem domains* on the other hand, is invaluable).
Sorry somehow my brain short-circuited somehow. /u/RDMXGD is right. The only book in my library that I think is a bit theoretical is Dusty Phillips' Python 3 Object Oriented Programming. Not sure about how good it is. Hope this helps. Now defunct answer: ~~My first recommendation would be [Dive Into Python](http://www.diveintopython.net/) by Mark Pilgrim which made me fall in love with the language within an hour. Besides being written for people who know a bit about programming already, it also has the added value of being free. Later, the [Python Cookbook](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1230000000393) by David Beazley and Brian Jones also worked for me because of its compactness.~~ 
And local host can change a hash of a name (different var but same meaning as user) with out any authentication or authorization. IP crafting the right packet to reset any password would be pretty trivial. The author should add a random salt to every user account and just store the creds in a sqlite file if the goal is simplicity.
Haha,I love these image names https://github.com/BloombergMedia/whatiscode/blob/master/research/image/obligatoryWordleThatThankGodWeNeverUsed.png https://github.com/BloombergMedia/whatiscode/blob/master/research/image/HorribleVisualizationOfCompaniesByLanguage.png 
&gt; That's all I can really think of. Also, it's sort of a pain to navigate to anaconda/envs/envname/lib/pythonversion/site-packages to check out pip installed libraries, but that's also not a real issue and not unique to anaconda. Doesn't "conda list" also print out pip libraries? It does on my system at work.
coverage.py is meant to be run as an application and has relatively sane code compared to other Python open source projects I've become familiar with. It's 2/3 polyglot compatible, which adds some ugliness, but overall it keeps things plain and reasonable.
On *nix especially (Which a lot of people use), it may not be explicitly expected, but you really should learn how to use scripting, as it's really powerful. There are a lot of problems that can be solved with a 20 line python script, if you know how.
Don't space out, then.
That is super cool. Any chance of sharing the code? I would love to see it!
Heck no, don't use that for cryptography. Use os.urandom instead or don't roll your own cryptography in the first place. 
No, `random.random` is based on a pseudo-random number generator, and as such it's not cryptographically secure. You can use [SystemRandom](https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/random.html#random.SystemRandom) instead, which offers the same interface but is based on your operating system's random number generator (`/dev/urandom` on Linux), which is secure. Or just read from `/dev/urandom` directly to generate a token: &gt;&gt;&gt; import os &gt;&gt;&gt; import base64 &gt;&gt;&gt; base64.b64encode(os.urandom(32)) 'pBqWjf//eqh8GXLtvY5fhwsZWNNmsWg0OdopApMdrko=' Another advice: You should use a better hash function for generating password hashes, such as bcrypt or scrypt (I believe python modules exist for both, unless you're on AppEngine, then I guess a regular hash function is the best you can do). Also, when comparing password hashes or other message digests, always use a [timing-safe comparison function](http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/83660/simple-string-comparisons-not-secure-against-timing-attacks) instead of `==` (Examples and explanation behind the link).
This is a little clumsy (too many words, kinda repetitive and a typo?): &gt; and will give you more insight in how to get started with more tools than only your browser Also, you only need one book: http://www.amazon.com/Python-Essential-Reference-4th-Edition/dp/0672329786
Check out Papers, Mendeley, Zotero, Endnote, which I think all produce APA-style (or any other style) citations. Also LaTeX for writing documents with citations. It's been years since I typed a reference, let alone the data for a program to generate a reference. Between Papers and LaTeX it's all automated. Edit: just to clarify, I think it's great that you have used/learned some programming to solve a specific problem. I hope the fact that you're solving a problem that others have solved before in other was doesn't put you off, and that others pointing out these other implementations isn't seen as "why did you bother". We all have to learn, and learning involves reinventing many wheels, *necessarily*. Hopefully now that you understand the problem better, the other implementations will be something you can learn from too...
[quote]President - Power = Prime Minister[/quote] while that might be true for Russia, it's not for the rest of the world that has prime ministers and no presidents. Canada or the UK, for example. Taking this as an 'early form of machine cognition' would definitely be foolish. 
That's a good one, thanks! I couldn't find it earlier as its listed under **Internet Protocols and Support** in the Python Library Reference, whereas I was looking only in **Cryptographic Services**!
[Shameless Plug][HotspotD](https://github.com/prahladyeri/hotspotd) is a Linux daemon to create a wifi hotspot in AP mode. Its a small but useful project, and you are welcome to contribute. One thing we presently need is to test this across various Linux Distros and test whether it works or not. In case you are into Linux, this would be suitable for you.
This looks super interesting. I love precise parsers/pretty-printers. Wish it supported Python 3 syntax though :-(
Awesome! I've just started working with word2vec for a sentiment analysis project, and I'm floored by how powerful it is. I'm planning on spending this week glued to my desk to try to understand how it works, though.
PBKDF2 can be implemented just with a hash function, and can work well as long as you use a sufficient number of iterations.
The corpus was not just on texts on Russia and the US presumably, and since the word arithmetic didn't specify a country it was on the whole world
Is there some reason you can't build on top of [flask-login](https://flask-login.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)? 
Thanks, I did not know such a thing existed. This doesn't look like a official module from http://flask.pocoo.org. Is it third party?

Quick Google search for u.s. has ~4 million in tech industry, 122 million workers. That's ~3% in tech at all, ~97% not in tech. Of the 3% in tech, not all of them code...some are writers, managers, visual artists, etc. I can see programming as a legitimate and growingly demanded skill to have, but *essential*? No way. And it never will be.
Yes, map is weird. I recall hearing from Guido a long time ago that he didn't like map/filter and friends. We have comprehensions now that fulfill both with clearer syntax, and for loops for the more complicated cases. It has been many years since I have used map and filter and I don't miss them
If you look at the flow of the code, the get request to random.org is performed only ONCE, but you didn't do that, did you? Who's "beyond terrible" now, punk?
&gt; That would mean you must store the token somewhere, wouldn't it? Yup, in the database. &gt; Why not use a signed data structure? Like for example In your example, the token is generated by multiple layers of cryptography (combining a date/time string with a salt/secret and then hashing the entire thing) which is good, but even in that case, the digest needs to be stored between requests. Otherwise, how will the backend have something to validate in subsequent requests?

I don't see a need. for item in (i.lower() for i in items if i): # do something does the same thing and is readable. 
The only reason you might want to use the system python on OSX is if you want to build some OSX-specific software that for some reason must not bundle its own interpreter (some kind of system command line tool maybe?). But that doesn't sound like your use case at all - if you are doing scientific work anaconda is great.
Note you can also use filter to achieve these kind of conditional loops: for item in filter(lambda i: i in lst2, lst): # do something Would be equivalent to your proposed for item in lst if item in lst2: # do something Such a thing is very readable (more than the generator expression), especially in situations where you already have a function that does the if part: import os for item in filter(os.path.isdir, os.listdir()): # do something with folders map accomplishes your "as" example: for item in map(lambda s: s.lower(), lst): # do something And I think this is far more readable than your proposed syntax.
Click-baity title is click-baity. Relevant literature: [Mikolov et al.](http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/189726/rvecs.pdf) [Here](http://www.fit.vutbr.cz/~imikolov/rnnlm/word-test.v1.txt) is a list of analogies to test your model with. Get the GoogleNews model (trained on 100bn words) from [this page](https://code.google.com/p/word2vec/). Load it using the following code: from gensim.models import Word2Vec googlenews = '/path/to/GoogleNews-vectors-negative300.bin.gz' model = Word2Vec.load_word2vec_format(googlenews, binary=True) # This should return [('queen', real_number), ... ]: result = model.most_similar(positive=['woman', 'king'], negative=['man']) That should get everyone started.
You might want to post in /r/learnpython, this sub is more for news and stuff. Also take a look at [chr](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#chr) and [ord](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#ord) to convert letters into/out of their [ascii values,](http://www.theasciicode.com.ar/ascii-printable-characters/lowercase-letter-a-minuscule-ascii-code-97.html) that way you can do this: alphabet = dict([ (chr(97+i), i+1) for i in range(0, 26) ]) alphabet2 = dict([ (i+1, chr(97+i)) for i in range(0, 26) ]) To build your dictionaries instead of typing it out.

Everything is 3rd party. Flask doesn't come installed with Python and neither does SQLAlchemy. However, it's a very common extension for Flask and it is mentioned somewhere in the docs on Pocoo.
This sounds an awful lot like jwt. Search for 'jwt token'. I'm sure there are python libs for this.
You assume that the only people who can find value in coding are those who work in the tech field. Virtually every job can benefit from coding because virtually every job comes into contact with computers. On top of that, we're surrounded by computers - most of us carry them around in our pockets today! Why limit the essential determination to profession? If I dug ditches for a living, would reading and writing not be essential? This is no different than saying people don't need to know how to write/communicate effectively or know math based on the number of English teachers or accountants. 
That comment makes it abundantly clear that you have no experience in machine learning, and probably not much statistics either. What scares me are the sixteen people that took your comment at face value.
The python 3 behavior seems perfectly sensible to me. The idea of it is that if you pass a function that takes multiple arguments, you can pass the arguments in as separate lists. `zip_longest`'s behavior is kind of incoherent in that context. Now, I can understand the argument that maybe `map` should only take exactly two arguments, and if the user wants to use a multi-argument function, he can manually `zip` his lists. In fact, I agree with that wholeheartedly (whatever minor performance gains are to be had here are unlikely worth the confusing syntax). But if we're going to accept multiple arguments to `map` the python 3 choice seems like the obvious rational choice. Python 2's behavior is just crazy though. No arguments there.
Why is it unusual? Github is a mystery to me.
/r/Python is for news and releases. /r/learnpython, despite the name, is for questions. While you're here though, no, it isn't. Even if it was, you should never roll your own crypto.
OK. I just completely disagree with your view and suspect that there is no way for me to make you change that view, so I guess that's that. 
I used to like to relax to O'Reilly *X in a Nutshell* books, but they became too huge as more and more pages just regurgitated the online docs for X's standard library. I do like O'Reilly *X Cookbook* books. Don't let the practical-sounding title deter you. The Cookbooks do, however, assume you know at least a little something about X. 
Code wise, no __main__, globals everywhere
Just FYI : apart from [special hardware] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_random_number_generator) all the random generated numbers are generated using [pseudorandom generators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudorandom_number_generator) except that the one from the libs you suggested is better. Regarding relevance to OP's question, anyway don't do your own crypto.
they support it a bit: "Disclamer: RedBaron (and baron) is working with python3 but it NOT fully parsing it yet."
GitHub is for managing code, most people cloning won't be able to, or won't want to run the same binary
PBKDF2 is also relatively easy to implement, you don't need to mess with a 3rd party module. 
Yeah, given you have the hash function implemented it's just a matter of "assembling the blocks" you already posses. But as always, implementing crypto yourself should always be avoided or done in a careful way.
&gt; ...always use a timing-safe comparison function instead... Thanks for the link, that was an interesting read and makes perfect sense too.
Looking at this it seems like I'm interested in a bunch of the inspect module. Thanks!
What specifically? Keep in mind this is a programming subreddit not a machine learning/stats sub He used one corpus, and the only tests for validity was whether the word equation seemed right to the author or not, then the data was cherry picked and a couple were presented. I don't think it's a stretch to say we don't have the data for making inferences on what changing one of the experiment variables will do.
You're welcome! That link is for the Py3 docs. Go to the Py2 docs if you're using Py2. 
It's awesome that you decided to make this in order to fix a particular problem of yours. You should remember to check there's no other tool that already does what you're trying to accomplish but I think there's a lot of value in the scientifical curiosity that led you to make this, so, congrats!
Download Spyder. It's 100x better than IDLE. You might already have it installed since I'm pretty sure it comes with WinPython.
A colleague and I did a presentation at Cloud Foundry Summit about this. (I'm the one in the hoodie). https://m.youtube.com/watch?list=PLhuMOCWn4P9g-UMN5nzDiw78zgf5rJ4gR&amp;v=QOz1UOf6MdU
No reason to discourage the lad. He had a problem and created a specific software solution to address it. I'd say that's pretty great. Good on you, OP!
If you're hiring I charge $40/hr .. if you're looking, what do you think you're worth?
I'm sure s/he appreciates feedback, but if I were able to identify a need and execute it like this *in high school*, I would be very proud of myself. I could barely get html right back then. 
I meant for looking at the code, but yeah, list works to see all the libraries and their versions in the env. Anyway, it's a problem that's easy to overcome.
and if you give a really unbalanced input dataset, you'll get really unbalanced/unreliable output. more data =/= better.
The overall majority of programmers know only one language. They're "code monkeys" who program because it pays well, or at least better than the alternatives, but they have no love for programming and when they leave work they *completely* stop being programmers until they start work the next day. They might have to do unpaid work from home as part of the demands of the job ("you must learn this web framework, but there is no budget for training") but it's still part of work. They have no passion for programming. The overall majority of *good* programmers know more than one language. They program for the love of it, and think that it is amazing that they are paid to do something which they would otherwise do for free. When they knock off work for the day, they continue to be programmers even when they aren't sitting at the computer programming: programming is not just their career, it is their passion. They read articles and blogs about programming, they write code for themselves, maybe an open source project or three on the side, they answer questions on Stackoverflow, or something similar. People who tell you there is no advantage to learning a second language almost certainly belong to the first category, not the second. It is a shame, because even if they only ever use Java, or VB, or PHP, the insights they will learn from a second language will make them a better Java, VB or PHP programmer.
Why do you recommend sublime text? You dont list any reasons why. 
Learn a second language, and a third. You will become a better programmer by understanding the differences between languages, and what is common between languages. If possible, learn a language from each major programming paradigm: object-oriented, procedural, imperative, functional, declarative. If you know an OOP language like Java, learn a functional language like Lisp or Haskell. (Expect that to be difficult -- they aren't easy languages. Maybe leave them for when you're a bit stronger as a programmer.) If you know a language with static typing like Java, learn one with dynamic typing like Python or Javascript or Lua. You don't have to master each one, but you need to get past the stage where you think "this language is stupid" and can see why others might prefer it over your favourite language. If you don't have time to learn to program in a second and third language, at least *read about them*. The aim is to gain insights into programming, not to learn the syntax. Syntax is easy, and unimportant. It is what you can do with the syntax that is important. Reading blogs by people programming in Ruby to find out how Ruby programmers think is not as good as actually learning Ruby, but it's better than being completely ignorant about Ruby. 
Both of those (the "in a Nutshell" and "Cookbook" series) look pretty good and may be very helpful. Thanks for the suggestions!
Personally I prefer http://citeulike.org and bibdesk to do the same. I find citeulike way nicer/easier than Mendeleys solution of your core problem : collecting and managing citations. 
"I don't like X type threads so i will make a thread complaining about them."
its a good start
No, random.random is not suitable for cryptographic applications. For that, you need to use random number generators which are designed, and tested, to be suitable for such cryptographic uses. But for the specific task you mention, returning a token, I don't think that counts as "cryptographic applications". It's just a token. It needs to be unpredictable enough that users cannot guess somebody else's token, but other than that I don't think it needs the much stronger crypto properties. Take this with a grain of salt, but I think for your purpose, random.random is fine. It's what the uuid module does. Actually, you probably should use the uuid module rather than reinvent your own. **UPDATE** I talked to the crypto expert at work, and he agrees with the folks saying that uuid.uuid4() is the right way to do it, with one proviso -- he says that if the system random doesn't exist, uuid ought to just fail hard and not fall back on Mersenne Twister. When I asked him what people should do on platforms without a good system random, he said they're screwed. He did admit that if the consequences of guessing a token are not important (the example he gave was, guessing a token means you get to download a mp3 that you didn't pay for), then Mersenne Twister is "good enough" as a fallback. But that's about it.
Clickbait much?
I'm a geologist, though not a great structural one, but I can handle a stereonet OK. I mostly do geodynamics, so I'm pretty good with NumPy, etc. I'll take a look into your project and see if I can help out. I'm in a similar situation to OP, so any tips on getting started?
Decent... when I was in HS we used some butchered method that you'd get flogged for using at university. That said, my HS was a waste of time. I used AGLC3 for legal citation (at law school) but was a big fan of APA during under-grad. Using an archaic system that relies on footnotes and rules such as 'Ibid' and 'Above n' makes you realise why APA is actually pretty darn good. 
IMO a cool project would be creating a proper program that does legal referencing for you. In Australia a lot of law students/academics use AGLC3. It's a pain because even if you use Endnote, you're stuck going through your document and editing the footnotes to match the rules. Be good to have an 'endnote' that does legal citation. IMO you could do it. What I'd do is: - Make a database with columns such as 'reference type', 'paper you are working on', [reference details such as author, title...etc]. - Make a script that lets you enter stuff into the database using step-by-step instructions. - Make another script that can output a bibliography (in AGLC format... which is a trick), create the correct footnotes (based on what you entered) AND... go through the whole document, applying all the AGLC3 rules. IMO it wouldn't require a massive level of technical expertise. You'd just need aomebody familiar with the referencing style who has the time to go through and debug all the rules. 
Thank you!
What is the advantage to your program, as opposded to existing solutions like http://citationmachine.net ?
&gt; the len operator pisses me off That's really just a subset of the general problem of the magical dunder functions. &gt; The lack of anonymous functions pisses me off Python has had lambdas for awhile. &gt; The useless map and reduce function piss me off Ditto on the functools module. If I were going to pick nits with Python, it'd be over its craptastic threading model.
Thanks for the advice, I just went ahead and did that 
Just added a license too
&gt; always use a timing-safe comparison function instead of == (Examples and explanation behind the link). Thanks, for that. Just changing the logic to use `!=` instead of `==` should make it cryptographically more secure.
You guys are awesome! Thanks for all the input!
Honestly I don't know of any other way to learn a language. Taking a class or reading a book or whatever is great, but until you actually try to implement that into a project and work through all the bugs/problems that come up you haven't really learned it.
It's literally the name of the talk and the video...
Of course, and since you now understand your program and its architecture, as well as existing alternatives, maybe you can extend yours to fill a niche that others don't, or you know what you're missing in the other alternatives and can implement it there. It's all positive, even if you decide not to keep your program, as you will keep the practice.
The only problem I have with the LaTeX world is the hopelessly outdated parts not being cleanly replaced by better alternatives. Sure, you're free to use minted, utf8 inputenc, biblatex and biber to get something approximately sane, but people have to discover that shit.
The timing attack happens because the `==` operator returns as soon as a part of the hash doesn't match. So, depending on how much time the `==` statement took to evaluate, the attacker can determine upto what part his hash is correct, and thus by enough brute-force, can determine the answer much sooner than expected of that algorithm. As the accepted answer in that link says: &gt; At the end, he tried just 256*len MACs (if len is the length of the MAC) instead of the 256^len he should have had to try. So, instead of checking `if (hash==x): user_is_valid()`, you check `if (hash!=x): return else: user_is_valid()`. `!=` is safe because it short-circuits as soon as the strings are different. It doesn't allow an attacker to measure the milliseconds and thus deduce anything. #Taken from Django Source Code def constant_time_compare(val1, val2): """ Returns True if the two strings are equal, False otherwise. The time taken is independent of the number of characters that match. For the sake of simplicity, this function executes in constant time only when the two strings have the same length. It short-circuits when they have different lengths. """ if len(val1) != len(val2): return False result = 0 for x, y in zip(val1, val2): result |= ord(x) ^ ord(y) return result == 0
I feel that Reddit functions better if the actual content of the individual reddit's match what they those reddits are intended for, ie. for their own rules.
ouch, probably not the best way to advertize your skills … https://github.com/ihoegen/PyCite-APA/blob/master/PyCiteAPAFree.py#L41-L110
EDIT: didn't have coffee yet, thanks /u/ichundes Also, why you should use /dev/urandom (instead of /dev/random as some recommend): http://www.2uo.de/myths-about-urandom/ The best part of the article is the quote by Daniel Bernstein: &gt; Cryptographers are certainly not responsible for this superstitious nonsense. Think about this for a moment: whoever wrote the /dev/random manual page seems to simultaneously believe that &gt; (1) we can't figure out how to deterministically expand one 256-bit /dev/random output into an endless stream of unpredictable keys (this is what we need from urandom), but &gt; (2) we _can_ figure out how to use a single key to safely encrypt many messages (this is what we need from ssl, pgp, etc.). &gt; For a cryptographer this doesn't even pass the laugh test.
Looks really useful. I had no idea something like that existed.
Oops, the first! Sorry.
Well for one thing, if you iterate over a collection with something like "for x in y:" you should not be appending or deleting from y inside your for loop. 
That doesn't really have any bearing on whether it's clickbait or not though.
But isn't it the case that both "==" and "!=" will return an answer as soon they encounter a difference?
Thanks for correcting
This is seriously awesome! way to go dude!
I use it in a number of places when working with hardware sensors. The file may contain just classes or functions which will be imported elsewhere but I don't want to run-up the main programme just to see what a sensor is outputting. Putting a short 'main' function in that will write out the current state of a sensor is really handy for fault finding or prototyping a new function.
I just built the [IUS](https://iuscommunity.org) python27 packages of this for RHEL/CentOS 5 and 6. They will be available in the testing repository after our automation runs tonight. 
Every time somebody complains about people asking questions, the response that floats to the top is the measured one: answer the question, and kindly direct them to /r/learnpython. Foster a positive community here. 
I was wondering if someone was going to eventually quote that at me ;)
I did a search of the mailing list. I could not find anything that was quite like what I was suggesting. Maybe just seared for the wrong terms. Or maybe 'if' and 'for' and considered stop words so impossible to search for...
That's at the top of my list of things to fix 
Best way to learn is to get out there and build something. Well done. 
Disagree with the relative imports. Reads like the author is trying to come up with reasons why his personal style preference should be the norm. To describe it as a "mistake" is ludicrous. If you're making a PACKAGE it should always be installed and added to your python path by a PACKAGE MANAGER. These aren't the bad old days of unzipping files in your Zope products folder.
For those, like me, that haven't heard of Processing before: https://processing.org/ Examples: https://processing.org/examples/
Sounds somewhat similar to my situation: We have any number of python web apps using Bottle. My 'standard' stack is now Nginx-&gt;uwsgi-&gt;Bottle-&gt; (custom code) -&gt; psycopg2 -&gt; postgres, and all new development in our company uses this. I usually adopt the unix philosophy of 'adopt the simplest tool to do the job at hand', and Bottle fits that requirement well: receiving and respond to HTTP requests. Apart from one bug we encountered with file handles not being closed correctly, it's performed excellently for us, and we were able to diagnose and isolate that bug precisely because the Bottle source code is so short.
Thank you!
I started getting into python 2 weeks ago so I expected it to be a little rough 
Can't one just use homebrew? There's an opencv3 formula in the science tap that looks like it can build both python27 and python3 libraries.
Yeah, that and _never_ using init for anything other than imports seems like a strange rule. I'm leery of rules from people comfortable using "always" and "never" without some kind of context.
Harvard data sci class, in python: http://cs109.github.io/2014/ Videos and ipython notebooks included 
Um, what does psutil do?
[pyAutoGui](https://pyautogui.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) &gt; Cross-platform GUI automation for human beings. &gt; PyAutoGUI is a Python module for programmatically controlling the mouse and keyboard. &gt; Platforms Tested: &gt; Windows &gt; OS X &gt; Raspberry Pi And yes, it works in Python 3 (and 2 as well if for some reason you're forced to use 2).
The brew command has "--with-contrib". As far as "nice to know ... cmake ...", that's very much a matter of opinion, and how much you value your time. (my own opinion is that CMAKE is a cancerous, baby-eating timesuck. YMMV.)
A must watch! This is the video that really got me into the testing mindset and has made me a much better programmer because of it. 
I suppose I agree -- it is a matter of opinion. I use OpenCV daily so I like to know the in's and out's. It also helps when diagnosing why compiles are failing. The other nice thing about compiling by hand is that you can run multiple versions of OpenCV (and multiple versions of Python) at the same time. This is extremely helpful given that this is the 3.0 release and it's useful to see what functions are failing in which versions.
What kind of models did you fit in SAS?
[This](http://www.sas.com/en_us/software/sas9.html) SAS? Also what kind of modeling?
 &gt;It's not just a matter what interests people, /r/learnpython is a community dedicated to answering basic Python questions and will likely provide better help to the people asking questions. Possibly, but a wider array of interests are covered in this forum. Besides not every question about programming in Python is at the beginners level. &gt;As long as it's not at all mean spirited I don't think it's a bad idea (or as someone else mentioned, make sure to link to learnpython in answers). Certainly passing along information about better resources should be encouraged. My problem is that I'm seeing more posts complaining about programming question then I see about actual programming questions. It really makes you wonder about the mentality of the people involved. 
This is a beginner's question, please submit it on /r/learnpython &lt;&lt;auto-submit 14 June&gt;&gt;
Relative imports are quite useful. In early development phase it is absolutely normal to rename your project. This can be done easily with relative imports. They can also help to have utility modules that you can just copy-paste in an other project without modifying the project's name. Although you're right about packaging, relative imports do not imply to not using it properly. It is just another way to make modular and movable modules, nothing more. From my point of view relative imports can help in large projects to identify what is imported from *this* project and what is imported from 3rd party libraries just by looking at imports.
&gt; My personal rule is actually `__init__.py` should usually be empty, there is a separate `_version.py` for raw version info and a `version.py` that makes it nice. I agree that `__init__.py` should usually be empty, but I make an exception for the main level `__init__.py` file. As long as you support `module.__version__`, how you do it is up to you. &gt; The justification for relative imports is wrong, but I use them a lot to save typing. I avoid it because my big package is too complicated and I'll take a 20 extra characters to be clear. I refuse to do `__init__.py` imports because then I'd end up importing the entire package when you only want something small. I shouldn't need to import `PyQt` in order to load a file writing function. It also works in Python 2.4 as well (I need that once in a blue moon), which is a nice bonus. &gt; Being import-order-dependent is a really sucky idea. I have one test module for every main module that imports it first, that should fail if there are any order-dependencies. That's a really good idea.
Yes, that SAS. We do predictive sales modeling. Take a number of attributes from previous sales, append demographic and credit data to and generate Gains Charts and Regression Analysis Charts. Our end game is to get the likely hood of buying broken into decile groups. Hope that answers your question, im just a python programer dont know too much about the modeling. Thanks! Matt
Because when you do this: digest = job["job"]["digests"]["digest"] converted_data[cluster] = digest You are not copying the values from the list in job["job"]["digests"]["digest"], you are copying the reference to the list in job["job"]["digests"]["digest"]. So basically converted_data[cluster] and _output["job"]["digests"]["digest"] contains the same thing : a reference to the same list. It's not that your data is added in two places, it's that your data is added in one place, referenced in two places. If you want to duplicate the values of the list, create a new list : digest = job["job"]["digests"]["digest"] converted_data[cluster] = list(digest)
I agree they have their place and usefulness. For identifying which is which package, I simply group imports as PEP 8 suggests: import os import sys import botocore import celery from my_package.foo import bar is pretty readable. import sys import celery from .bar import baz from ..spam import ham from ...waldo.grault import corge not so much. At the end of the day though it's all personal preference and to try to say one way is "wrong" and the other is "right" is silly (or arrogant, depending on how you look at it).
As full-time devops engineer (or if somebody will complain that devops is a methodology, performance testing, release and support engineer), I can't fully agree with some of these points (even understanding that they're written with RoR in mind). 1\. Codebase The general principle is good, use the same codebase on all possible environments. But I strongly disagree on interpreting codebase as VCS repository. You should *never* do git clone on your servers, use packages and install your apps with proper package managers. They'll give you versioning, dependency resolution, uninstallation and easy way to get the metainformation for free. 3\. Config You should never use environment variables for configuring your application. Store configuration in configuration files, read them and provide a way to specify a different path to it. Configuration files can be checked into a VCS, either encrypted or not (it doesn't matter), they can be read by sysadmins who will investigate into issues, and they can contain complex types like dicts and lists. I live in 2015 and I don't want to parse strings like in early 90s. We have yaml already. If you're going to store environment variables in some sh file and ``source`` it, congratulations then! You've implemented configuration file which is completely unknown by your app, so you can't do live reloads and type checking before starting the app like nginx does, for example. 5\. Build, release, run Symlinks for different versions? Really? Are you trying to implement Java alternatives? If your ``rollback`` stage is so simple as changing a symlink, you're should be able to do apt-get install yourapp-version_lower too. Stick with a single version deployed on a single server, don't blow your mind, don't try to understand which version exactly is responding on /. 11\. Logs Never log to ``stdout`` except when developing. Provide a way to configure your logging handlers to log wherever needed, and ``stdout`` is the least possible citizen here. ``stdout``-based logs are difficult to handle properly, difficult to rotate, difficult to find and to read for sysadmins. Don't use logstash just because somebody said that it is awesome. Start with goddamn file-based logging and if *that* will be the bottleneck - change your handler. 12\. Admin processes Never, *never* allow developers to go to production directly, via ssh or remote REPL. If they need it, then set up a "staging" environment that should be similar to the production. More people have direct access to the running instance, more ways the application has to die abruptly. Let Ops to do their job.
Which is what I do, every time, but it's getting really tedious.
I like pictures of kittens. When I go to look for pictures of kittens, even though I like really close up pictures of vaginas, a picture of one is annoying, and intrusive.
&gt; I refuse to do __init__.py imports because then I'd end up importing the entire package when you only want something small. Why I went though and deleted all the imports in my `__init__.py` files not long ago. That and the fact I can't be bothered to keep it up to date.
May be: [sqrt(a) as b for a in items if b &lt;= 1]

You'll want to use pandas, scikit-learn, numpy, matplotlib and maybe seaborn. They all have pretty good documentation and come in the anaconda python distribution (which i would highly suggest you install..its free!) Check out the following tutorials: http://danielfrg.com/blog/2013/01/02/python-replace-sas/ http://www.datarobot.com/blog/python-getting-started-with-data-science/ https://github.com/donnemartin/data-science-ipython-notebooks https://www.kevinsheppard.com/images/0/09/Python_introduction.pdf Try tutorials. Unfortunately, I don't know of any out of the box Gains Charts, but there are plenty of other metrics: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html You can also use bokeh to create interactive web visualization of your models and analysis: http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/ 
&gt; 1 \_\_init\_\_.py is Only for Imports No, it isn't? If it makes sense to initialize the package in \_\_init\_\_.py then by all means do it. &gt; 2 Use \_\_init\_\_.py to Enforce Import Order wat Why are your imports order dependent? That only makes sense if you are executing code at module-level??!! &gt; 3 Use One Module to Define All Exceptions Why not use one module to define all classes? Why even have a package in the first place? Put everything into one module. &gt; 4 Only Relative imports within the package .... &gt; The sub-modules will only function properly if the package is installed in PYTHONPATH. That's not how it works. Also, virtualenv. &gt; The sub-modules will only function properly if the package is named a_package. Likewise, don't use the linux root directory structure. Use shell variables instead. Because you know, someone might have /bin named /binary instead. &gt; 5 Keep Modules Small ... &gt; only have one class definition per module, Yes, I love writing code that looks like this: from .orange import Orange from .apple import Apple from .pineapple import Pineapple Instead of, you know, something like this this from .apples import Apple, Pineapple from .colors import Orange
Thanks a bunch this looks like a great course!
Agreed - they are nice points to start with but some of them are a touch dated. I would suspect that taking the 12 points and matching them to the best practices for the various languages will make for a stronger/more performant/more secure application. 
Why not `pip install PyAutoGUI` in a virtual environment? They work just as well on Macs as on Linux.
I don't understand exactly what you want to do/ you're trying to do. Could you be more precise? What is long_name_function?
I have a function with a long name that I want to reference as al. I then want to set a bunch of persistent values within the function. al.value_a = 10. al.value_b = 20. Then I can easily swap the function and all the values will apply to the new function just by changing the al reference. 
2: Enforcing import order really wigs me out- it implies either: - You have a circular dependency somewhere- in your class hierarchy, or , or you're executing library code at import time, which is almost always a bad idea (decorators being the obvious exception). - You are importing something from somehere other than where it was defined (for instance, from the `__init__.py`). Importing from `__init__.py` is fine for clients- it keeps them simple- but your library itself should generally import things from where they *actually* live. There should really never be a case where import order matters. The things you import handle their own imports, so the act of importing shouldn't have side effects. 3: I've recently been convinced this is *not* best practice, any more than you should define all your functions in a single file. I think that you should define any *base* classes in their own file- after all, all exceptions in your library should probably derive from a single base class. However, I think it makes more sense to put Exceptions that are caused by specific modules in those modules. If you're hunting through source code to try "to find all of the exceptions a package is capable of raising," it means something has gone terribly wrong in the *documentation*. 4: Implicitly relative imports (that is, without a `.` prefix) almost always lead to trouble, especially when you go from a development execution to `setup.py install`. You should try to avoid `from . import X` imports, as they encourge the problems I mentioned aboce with locally importing from `__init__.py`. `from .. import x` just seems like asking for trouble- it breaks the modularized nature of modules. Better to do a fully qualified import at that point: `from my_package.other_module import X`/ 
I can sort of agree with this- content should go in "real" source files. However, I'm nervous about the fact that she later imports from `__init__.py` in her library code (that is, `from . import X`), which is just *asking* for import errors or circular dependencies. Better to qualify your imports- either `from my_package.my_module` or, worst case, `from .my_module`.
Technically, you can reassign `__defaults__` but that's a horrible idea. How about asking what you *really* want to do?
On Linux, tools like Monit are useful for this. On Windows, the 'right' way to do it is to make the script a service, per http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32404/is-it-possible-to-run-a-python-script-as-a-service-in-windows-if-possible-how — although I've never tried this and accept that it looks a little complicated. You could probably get most of the benefit by using Windows Scheduler to schedule your task on startup, and maybe restart it if it fails, although it's likely to be a bit more fragile.
"I want to set a bunch of persistent values within the function" This is the bit that's confusing everyone. It seems an unusual thing to want to do, so can you give specifics on what you're doing and why you think this is the right solution? If the implementation of your idea seems difficult to get out in code, your design is often wrong or overcomplicated.
&gt; CMAKE is a cancerous, baby-eating timesuck I find cmake vastly superior to the likes of hand make makefiles, at least. But, it seems that all build systems mostly suck, and I'd love to find an exception. What do you recommend? 
On linux I would search the net for the term 'daemon' which is often used for continual processes e.g. http://www.jejik.com/articles/2007/02/a_simple_unix_linux_daemon_in_python/ Also, if running say once every 5 mins is adequate, consider 'cron'
Have you tried Supervisor? (http://supervisord.org/)
Try: al = long_name_function Firstly, you are attempting to call long_name_function with no arguments by writing it as long_name_function(). Secondly, your function has no exit method so when the with block closes it will fail. You do not understand what the with keyword does. I'm also pretty sure you don't want to do what you think you want to do. There is almost certainly about 50 more elegant ways to complete whatever task you are trying to accomplish. I would recommend either a class, factory function, or decorator. Decorators are basically factory functions with modified syntax.
He want to implement a callable class for which the value returned by __call__ depends on instance variable. Making it accessible as context manager might also be possible, but roughly it seem like te_anau should better describe the higher lever of what he want to do instead of how to acchieve it.
sorry for the confusion, ill explain it at a higher level. I am doing a bunch of physical hardware sensor prototyping and data logging. I have an algorithm ( currently just a function that accepts a few arguments) that will process the incoming stream of data. But i anticipate the need to chop and change the algorithm as i go along. So i would like to set it all up so i can change one line of code and swap between a few experimental functions. I wish to initialize a bunch of variables and have them persist across multiple calls to the function. ( running totals etc ) Rather than global variables i figured i would [set the variables directly within the function](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/279561/what-is-the-python-equivalent-of-static-variables-inside-a-function) most of what i describe works fine, but once i start passing arguments to the function the referencing begins to fail. is that making more sense?
If I build a python app that uses opencv is there a way I can distribute it to non technical people or does everyone need to do all these steps?

You can use a Google Summer of Code program's list of organizations that are looking for contributors. No guarantee that all they are really friendly to everyone, but worth to check out. Just filter it by "python" tag: http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/org/list/public/google/gsoc2015
Do you have to print the Houston thing from inside the loop? If so you could do this for N in range(10): print(N + 1) if N == 9: print("Houston we have lift off!") If not just do this: for N in range(1, 11): print(N) print("Houston we have lift off!") But don't do this: for N in range(1, 11): print(N) print("Houston we have lift off!") The last will give the same incorrect result as what you saw.
A Burmese python can reproduce without males so that could be a very feminist python, but idk how to program such a python.
I realize this is a "micro script" but it seems more useful to include the `git log` command in the git-authors file instead of having to remember all the correct `git log` flags. Is there a reason not to run `git log` using `subprocess`?
Run a 1-node instance for free at https://www.heroku.com, or at amazon free tier t1.micro machine (700 hours free). Use "watch" bash command to run it continuously, together with "nohup" (beginning) and/or "$" (end) at your script (procfile for heroku). I already did it a lot, in both ways. I'm in a hurry now, so I just threw up these information here. Sorry ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ 
I'm betting on this to be true. I just finished an upper-division course in bioinformatics using Python at my university, and I don't feel like I learned much and just stressed me out far more than it should have. But because of that class, I'm working on the computational bio components for a neuroscience lab on campus, so hopefully a summer's worth of working on code that I *want* to write will actually teach me something.
Get a vps or similar, and just make a service out of it. It's super easy to do in upstart or systemd.
The easiest, terriblest way would be to start a tmux or screen session, and inside it run: $ while true; do ./my_app.py; done It's not nearly so robust as the cron or Supervisor ideas (I personally like "runit"), but it's way easier to set up. This might be just fine if you only wanted it running for a certain short period of time and don't want to learn about process monitoring to get it done. 
Great! That's a great way to learn.
You should take this down. I do the same but this makes it easy for people to cheat and cheating ruins the thrill of these problems. We all give in to temptation sometimes, and your post makes it easier. Good job though!
I have two suggestions. 1. You are using too many classes. Python is not Java. For example in solution one you could have just as easily had a function that returned the multiples. 2. I generally put all my top level code in a `main` function and call it at the bottom of my files like this if __name__ == '__main__': main() For toy problems like this it isn't nesicary, but it becomes important when you start importing code from other modules. EDIT: Code formatting isn't working for some reason, sorry.
The [documentation for FTP.login](https://docs.python.org/2/library/ftplib.html#ftplib.FTP.login) states that it shouldn't be called if the username was specified in the constructor. Maybe remove that and see what happens.
Sounds like a whole lot of not his/her problem.
1. Nope, `__init__.py` is only for *nothing*. Your damn imports mean that I'll see a repr somewhere and not realize that what debugging information calls `foo.bar.Bar` should be called `foo.Bar`. Bonus points for circular import issues. Leave your `__init__.py` files empty. If you don't want a level of namespace, don't introduce a package. 2. Don't have situations where order of imports matters. If you simply have a non-cyclical dependency tree, this happens automatically. If you have circular dependencies, refactor them out of your code so that you don't have extra complexity to think about. 3. Put your exceptions where they belong. For a small project, this is very likely one place. For a large framework with multiple layers of stuff various places, it almost certainly isn't. If my code includes networking APIs, an HTTP implementation, a JSON-RPC implementation on my HTTP implementation, and an remote object abstraction on top of that, my remote-object-related exceptions don't belong the same place as the networking stuff. 4. Relative imports are mainly good for one reason: they will create an error if you try to run a file from inside your package. (This can lead to subtle bugs if it works.) The blog's reason (2) is a traditional explanation, but one that turns out to be immaterial, and its reason (1) is a misfeature and not stated correctly. 5. See (1). Module size should be as big as it takes to define a namespace. Don't force your poor user to have confusing reprs. It might be clear to you what the canonical import is, but it probably isn't for everyone else.
&gt; Why? Init files should be used for initialization. Ideally for nothing, since no real initialization should occur on mere import in the normal case. In fact, the most important thing they *shouldn't* be used for is for importing their subpackages, as this is fundamentally circular. &gt; &gt; Use __init__.py to Enforce Import Order &gt; If that's really an issue, you're doing it wrong. Amen
Just fucking ignore them then, godammit
&gt;&gt; 3 Use One Module to Define All Exceptions &gt; Why not use one module to define all classes? Why even have a package in the first place? Put everything into one module. I'm actually on board with that for large packages. You shouldn't need to import 5 different files to import all the exceptions. Additionally, I also import all the exceptions in the main paths of the code that a user could expect to hit (if you want to go down some obscure path, then no).
[DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) or [AWS](http://aws.amazon.com/) I currently have a django site running on DO and did something similar to you. I had scripts running on AWS, scraping RSS feeds and storing it in MongoDB.
Did the same for a little bit, quickly realized that its slow.
I'm interested in seeing how this plays out. At my company we use a lot of SAS for modeling with minimal python for data management. If your data is large enough you're going to experience performance lags over SAS, which doesn't hold data in memory. There's plenty of Ipython notebooks out there to get you started just start with OLS regressions and build from there.
Hey! I just noticed this post! I am one of the package owner. We have some solid updates coming out for Scipy 2015 along w/ a paper explaining more. P.S. We don't have mapping.... yet. But you could help build that out? Huh? Huh? Yeah?
Basically, it's because you have to choose some parameter for your hypothesis test (how do I decide if the input is a 1 or a 0?), and that parameter places you somewhere along the ROC. When you receive a signal, you calculate a metric (such as the [likelihood ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likelihood-ratio_test)) then compare it to the selected threshold. The choice of metric determines the ROC, and the threshold places you at some point on the ROC.
you need to exorcize the java out of you! :) Here's a version I think is more Pythonic. print(sum([i for i in range(1000) if i%3 == 0 or i%5 == 0]))
Hmm I see a lot of discussion on fallthrough in case statements. Surprisingly, its talked about as if its a 'good thing'. In case you were wondering, its not. Fallthrough isnt obviously the intent and its easy to get wrong by simply missing a break (in C anyway). So why have switch/case? Its obviously better wand better with large numbers of cases and Performance. Try reading a 50 entry elif then try a 50 entry switch/case, enough said? Performance. My understanding is that in C at least a switch is implemented as a jump table. The case value is an index into a table of addresses to the code to be executed. You don't get much faster than that. Compare that to repeated 'is s=3' then 'is s ==4' . 
Some of us use MacPorts, so mixing homebrew with ports isn't a great idea.
Numpy would handle most operations just fine, however the reason I suggested Pandas was because of better file handling, and because filtering and manipulating the named columns is much more powerful than raw numpy arrays.
I tried it one year ago. There are many points we could discuss on.. QPython is a very good IDE, simple to use, It includes a lot of python libreries. But it does not include an apk packager. Kivy is one of the most powerful GUI available for android. It also include documentation and tools for the apk packaging. In general for little scripts the python programming on android could be usefull, but for complete applications It's not the right way.
Pandas is built on top of numpy, it basically just adds extra convenience functions for manipulating numpy arrays.
Okay, this is an apple to melons comparision. the remote test uses a new requests instance ( tear down and set-up of a new HTTP request, not a session ) for each call, except in Tornado , where it uses tornado.httpclient.AsyncHTTPClient and in muffin where it's using aiohttp.request So, I'll personally say that the remote benchmark is _severely_ flawed in that sense. (Requests might have a pretty API, but it is one of the, if not _the_ worst performing http libraries you can use)
numpy is the workhorse, pandas just adds delight. I know I need numpy, but pandas just makes me happy to use. Every time I need to do some data manipulation, I find some new pandas function that lets me do it in one line. Today I found out about combine_first for combining dataframes with priority. One line. Great use case. Love.
I'm pretty sure that there's a got module you can use for stuff like this. As it is, this is just a very specific replacement for a grep/awk pipeline.
I just shamelessly tell people hey I'm a physics BS looking for analyst / data science work. Pls hire me thnx.
Is that against the rules of /r/Python?
1. Code reddit bot in python, 2. make it react to some keywords to post a link to your resume and say you're available to work every time someone talks about that matter 3. Profit. 
How about a weekly thread for people to post their availability, or employers to post jobs for Python programmers?
4 . Use "open", "position" and "anal[ytics]*" as key words. 5 . Accidentially start spamming /r/gonewild with resumé 
You're totally right, and alternatives are linked at the bottom of the article. This one really is about how to process streams efficiently, and about using the right data structure for the problem. What it does is just a side effect. 
I've found iPython Notebook to be an awesome way of documenting things like Project Euler solutions. That way your journey of discovery/learning is captured in a very verbose way, instead of being hidden away in the git history.
This is for educational purposes, and separation of concerns is a useful concept. Also, hiding these details was not the goal at all. Still, you are right about the "remembering issue". That is why: $ git-authors Error: this program expects a pipe attached to standard input. This looks like a terminal. Recommended usage: $ git log --encoding=utf-8 --full-history --reverse "--format=format:%at;%an;%ae" | git-authors 
This. Aty this point, I don't think it's a relevant platform anylonger. 
What if that were an app for cleaning caches and making android phone have a clean master. ...That sounds to be too many functionalities for a Python-android app. &gt; I tried kivy 2 years ago. But really kivy can not be good for complete app. HTML5 app even better. How do you think HTML5 mobile app then?
_java_csharp_cpp_c is right. However, the python for android programming is fairly far to be considered complete. Some apis are not working and furthermore it requires a lot of dirty work to make it distributable.
Yes, but you have to be careful with `zip_longest` for exactly that reason. There is a reason that `zip_longest` isn't the default behavior of `zip`. If using `zip_longest`, you can't do something simple like `list(map(sum, a, b))`, if `a` or `b` is infinite, while you can if using `zip`.
If you really want opencv3, and don't want to wait, it's probably **still** easier to install homebrew, build opencv3, copy it out of /usr/local, and remove homebrew. 
Yeah. That's true. I heard from an entrepreneur who had represented board members to visit Google Android Team that the team is mostly focusing on how to make things work other than making things elegant. And that's exactly the difference between Google and Apple. For the rest, Android just open his door and let people play around. * Here's a google cleaning app [clean master](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cleanmaster.mguard) . Yet its company just had an IPO in Nasdq last year. Almost all because of this app. If you can not resist the seduce from this app, you may install more apps after you've cleaned. Maybe because the advertising is so attractive. * If you want to try this app, please tell me how you feel. Thanks! :)
I just have checked it out. Thanks for sharing. I think this is another way of representing content using HTML. It looks like another framework. In Django, Object Form is considered to be another capsule of HTML content. Yet your library can be implanted with in some Python-able platforms. But for a standalone app using the *gui* lib, I have not found the way to packet for different platforms into binaries. 
Right you are. I use the open source notepad++ for everything from light scripts to full html/css/js web projects, and it has never failed me once. I have also toyed with pyCharm and Eclipse PyDev, but code-completion in a dynamic language is near impossible to achieve fully. Moreover, if npp ain't broken, why should I fix it?
Tags maybe as an idea to suggest? Forhire or something.
"Anyone here like la[m]bdas?"
It is just a GUI library. For the packaging you can use common tools like py2exe. I never packed a python software because, in my opinion, scripting languages encourages the sharing of code. So converting it in binary, in a particular manner, is countersense.
Wish someone builds a Python compiler that compiles to Java ByteCode. I don't know whether its even possible or not. But if that happens, it would be very easy to directly create an APK from Python without depending on any tools.
I prefer to keep the virtualenv outside , and just keep the contents of "pip list &gt; requirements.txt" in version control. That way I can work on Linux, while the rest of the team develop on Windows, and it alls works fine, as we're not overwriting each other's virtualenv directory.
It's just a pattern, and either actually works fine. My pattern is to always call my virtual environment in the project directory, and always call it `venv`. I added this line to my `~/.bash_profile1: alias sv='source venv/bin/activate' so that once I'm in the directory, I can just type `sv` and activate the environment. You should _never_ include a virtual environment in source control, but instead run `pip freeze &gt; requirements.txt` to export you current requirements, and `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install them in a new environment. As for your broken virtual environment, there are a number of things that could be wrong, but it seems like it may have something to do with your base installation of Python in relation to virtualenv. If you are on OS X you should check out [this article](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/install/osx/), it's highly recommended to brew install a version of Python over using the system Python.

I use the QPython console on my phone occasionally for a calculator. It's faster to just type print 100**(0.5) than it is to find the sqrt button on most calculator apps I've tried, for example. I wouldn't want to use a smartphone for any serious coding though for probably obvious reasons. Tablet might be okay, but I don't have one to try it on. Mostly I like the app for the satisfaction that I *could* write a program on my phone if I wanted to.

Thanks that is really helpful and a great tip on how to generate and use a requirements.txt (I didn't know how to generate one automatically before). I had downloaded python3 from the official python site and was using pip3 that comes with that. However I'm not sure why the virtualenv pip(3) doesn't work as if I look in the venv project folder I can see both pip and pip3 there. You mentioned it could be caused by several different things. Could you let me know what are the most likely and I can try to diagnose if that is the issue? Thanks. 
There really aren't that many interpreted languages, a lot of translate into bytecode and run that. CPython isn't interpreted, nor is Java/VB. Not sure about the other implementations of Python, but CPython is the most commonly used. Shell is, though.
No, it's a tradition to do a Why Django Sucks talk at PyCon every year. It's just a self-effacing title. They're trying to figure out how to keep making Django better and better.
how about jython?
Yeah, I know that it's documented, but it's not a great case study example to introduce Pandas if the author doesn't at least have a few sentences explaining what he's doing. To be honest, I don't think a time series based example was a great example case study for an Intro to Pandas notebook. Handling datetime objects is in general a giant pain in the ass and the syntax in his example isn't obviously intuitive in terms of what it's doing. I did notice that the author does explain things in more detail after the case study so I guess it might not be a bad idea to skip past the case study if it ends up being confusing. I will say that I've also found the documentation and tutorials on the Pandas website to be great at introducing various features/concepts in Pandas.
good idea, thanks.
Use virtualenvwrapper. It will automatically put the venvs inside your home directory, allowing you to refer to them just by name, e.g. `workon foo`.

Thanks those are great tips. 
&gt;Unfortunately, it turns out the combination on each lock is pre-set; it can't be changed to FRED BUNS. In many cases, you *can* change the combination by removing the rings and putting them back on in the preferred order. I assume this has been tried.
I think it's great that you have implemented this, however if you're looking for a different way of doing it, then you should investigate regex using python's re module. https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html then you could do something like import re print re.sub(r'\(.*\)', '', string) the regex here is r'\(.*\)' which essentially matches a pattern that consists of a literal ( any character 1 or more times then a literal ) and replaces it with an empty string.
They are literally the devil. *edit: do I really need to add /s? C'mon people..*
Because people had great expectations.
should be `.*?` or `[^)]*`, btw.
It looks like the issue might be using virtualenv with iCloud or dropbox. Don't know if anyone has managed to get it to work with either?
I agree with your scripting language theory. Here compiling means to make them more mobilizable. Install them instantly without any pain. 
Hi, just curious, did you purposely use tab character for indentation? FYI, in case if you don't know, PEP8 recommend using 4 white spaces instead of tab [PEP8: Indentation](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#id12)

Because you are a coder and can handle programming very well. As for others ,who don't know programming at all but need to do some calculations, they would need an actual calculator. Their wanting result is to solve the problem. In general, a sufficient app has more common meaning. QPython is kind of coder/hacking tool rather than a general custom tool. Or can anyone build a custom tool using QPython?
And I think they do not make much money but netweight is so big. As for their product, UI is very plain.

If you just want an image and no interactivity, Google has a static maps API that you can just send co-ordinates to and get an image in response.
I have never used it personally. But I think [FuckIt.py](http://drtomcrick.com/2014/01/17/fuckit-py-the-python-error-steamroller/) might be what you are looking for.
How does this post not even mention checking for booleans? You should never use == for them, which means that unless you're writing code without booleans, you should use "is" pretty damn often.
No it's just ORMs. Since they are used in a ton of different languages. It's not a Python specific thing.
Maybe I'm missing something, but when would I want to use either "==" or "is" to check for a boolean? Normally, I don't care if something is True or just true-ish. So I put the expression I want to check in an "if" statement: if foobar: # check if foobar is True do_whatever() 
Not sure if joking...?? The exception output is killing the other apps that need the query output. This does look legit.. lol Is there really no nice "pythonic" way of handling this?
You are right, your code should be suppressing exceptions. I tried this myself figuring that something was amiss with your example. There might be a bug with the ping method. Knowing nothing about the internals of all this, the pooling method for ES could be doing some multiprocessing so the exceptions are happening there?
From [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#programming-recommendations): --------- * Comparisons to singletons like None should always be done with is or is not , never the equality operators. Also, beware of writing if x when you really mean if x is not None -- e.g. when testing whether a variable or argument that defaults to None was set to some other value. The other value might have a type (such as a container) that could be false in a boolean context! * Don't compare boolean values to True or False using == . Yes: if greeting: No: if greeting == True: Worse: if greeting is True: -------- I'm not sure what they'd suggest if trying to compare two boolean variables. You could do nested if statements or something like these suggestions to get a xnor: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/432842/how-do-you-get-the-logical-xor-of-two-variables-in-python , but maybe I'm just over-thinking it.

Don't see any multiprocessing here. The module only does a query and response at the time it gets called.
Obviously.
Thanks for the feedback. Regarding formatting: this is a matter of taste, but point taken, I like both versions. Not sure if it's worth a "barf" :-). Regarding encoding: this should be a program with simple (read "non-complex") behavior, not a full-features program that automagically adjusts to its environment. Properly displaying this data in the terminal is only of secondary priority. Nevertheless, you can surely change the code to have a look at `sys.stdout.encoding`. But this can be `None` in which case you might need to make dangerious assumptions (oh, and yes, also Python might be forced to make some quite dangerous assumptions about the output encoding if you do not take care of this yourself) or bail out with an error. All this is surely possible, but the ratio of additional complexity is not always justified by an increase of user experience. Here it was obvious to just make an extremely simple specification: output is UTF-8, done. By the way, git's internals deal with byte sequences only, but try to make sure that as much the commit-related data is UTF-8-encoded. This data is, by default, output as-is to a terminal (and easily contains byte sequences that are invalid in UTF-8). So, the git-authors wrapper doesn't change much of this behavior, except that it ensures that its output is valid UTF-8 at all times.
It is possible that you specifically want to know that it is True or False and not say 7, ['I', 'am', 'a', 'monkey'], or 'python rules'.
I can't imagine when this isn't a code smell.
Whenever you want to check if something is `True` or something is `False`, not "True-ish" or "False-ish". If I have a variable that can be `True`, `False`, or `None`, I'm going to use `x is True`, `x is False`, and `x is None`. If I didn't, then `not x` would return `True` for `x = False` and `x = None`. Also, I disagree with the premise of your post. You should be using `is`, but not when you want to compare two objects for equality. The `is` operator is for checking if two variables point to the same object. Python does not make primitives true objects, though, so you should only be using `is` on defined classes, not built-ins. It's also very, very useful for determining if two collections are the same without comparing their elements. Comparing large collections can be costly, but if their `id`s are the same then the comparison is performed in _nanoseconds_. For example in IPython: &gt;&gt;&gt; class Dummy: &gt;&gt;&gt; def __eq__(self, other): &gt;&gt;&gt; return True &gt;&gt;&gt; x = [Dummy() for _ in range(100000)] &gt;&gt;&gt; %timeit x == x 1000 loops, best of 3: 1.97 ms per loop &gt;&gt;&gt; %timeit x is x 10000000 loops, best of 3: 38.7 ns per loop And it's only this fast because [when you use `==` on lists Python first tries comparing the `id`s before it calls `==` on the elements](http://stackoverflow.com/q/29215418/839246): &gt;&gt;&gt; y = [Dummy() for _ in x] &gt;&gt;&gt; x is y False &gt;&gt;&gt; x[0] is y[0] False &gt;&gt;&gt; x == y True &gt;&gt;&gt; %timeit x == y 10 loops, best of 3: 167 ms per loop There are use cases for these operators in Python, that's why they exist. Instead of advocating against their use, you should strive to understand why they were added in the first place and try to educate others on how to use them properly. A good example is `eval`. I used to think `eval` was a necessary evil in Python, then I watched a [talk by Raymond Hettinger](https://youtu.be/wf-BqAjZb8M?t=2883) where he talks about his use of `eval` in the implementation of `collections.namedtuple`, and how no one has ever asked him how it works after reading the source because it's intuitive. It immediately convinced me that my understanding of `eval` was wrong, not that `eval` itself was.
What's an "untrue" object in Python?
I'm not saying, "Never use 'is'." Of course it has its uses. Rather, I'm saying that in most cases, you shouldn't be using it. (That's why the title is "almost never," rather than "never.") I teach Python to lots of newbies, and also consult to many companies that use Python. A very large number of Python developers seem to think that "is" is a faster, better version of ==. The point of this post was to try to explain to people what "is" does (and doesn't do), and to describe the situations in which you might be lulled into thinking that it's doing something it's not.
`None`, `0`, `[]`, `''`, `set()`, `{}`, `()`, `collections.OrderedDict()`, and more. These are not `False`, the are `False`-ish, meaning that when you call `bool` on these values you will get `False`. This allows you to do `if not []` or `if not 0` or whatever, but that does not make them `False`.
Well I have more functions inside of func_a and I need to reference specifically func_b()

Great, thanks!
What's a sentinel object?
PiedPython? What a stupid name. 
What does `func_a` return?
Just read the link I gave. There are examples from medicine that make a lot of intuitive sense. Basically, as you turn up the gain on some signal receiver, generally you will be more sensitive (you won't miss actual stuff you want to catch) but you will be less discriminating (you'll also catch stuff you do NOT want--false positives). The ROC curve will show you how well your system does as you crank up the gain. 
I think this post should be titled "You should know what 'is' and '==' do before using them". If you don't know what they do, obviously you wouldn't know how to use them correctly, so should you learn. And if you do know what they do, then there aren't any hidden gotchas (as far as I know) where you'd *think* one of them is the right choice but the other actually is.
Well maybe I didn't do a good job simplifying the actual problem. Here's what I have in file_a (web2py framework): def users(): def GET(user_id): return "user" def POST(**vars): return "new user created" return locals() # this is a web2py thing As mentioned above, in another function in a different file I need to reference POST: def run_file(file_a, POST): As it is, I'm getting HTTP: 404 NOT FOUND [invalid function (file_a/POST)] 
You mean what *is* a sentinel object. 
I don't think he is joking, not that I would use fuckit.py (or .js or any of the fuckit family) in a serious environment. Rather than exception try catch baseexception. I cant link to the docs which would give a better/full explanation but basically EVERY exception will be cause by this including system exceptions (hence why you don't normally catch these) (and opposed to anything inheriting from exception which is what you should normally only have yo deal with). If that doesn't work im out of ideas for the moment. EDIT: Actually looking at that stack trace more closely reminds me of a similar error I saw. Gimme a second to find the comment. Edit 2: Nope don't think so. Just in case you want to double check here is the link http://reddit.com/r/Python/comments/37gr6w/assistance_please/crmo692 But otherwise im back to the above.
This *isn't* helping.
So what do you recommend for beginning programmers who aren't ready for concepts like "object identity?"
so, `users().GET(blehhh)` should do what you want. so you'd define the function that way and call it with run_file(file_a, users().POST):
referring to an element as "i" is confusing. use another name since "i" is used for index variables. use del to delete an element from a list. other than that do your own homework. see help([]) or help(list) e.g. del mylist[3] 
I would ditch Codecademy only because it looks for an answer to be presented in a very particular way. It is frustrating and you could spend that time with a better free method of learning Python. I think someday Codecademy will be great but now some of the exercises are bugged. I would also check out some free online courses offered on Coursera and edX. There are several to choose from. 
Generally, any empty aggregate or zero number. For example: &gt;&gt;&gt; bool([]) False &gt;&gt;&gt; bool([1,2,3]) True &gt;&gt;&gt; bool(0) False &gt;&gt;&gt; bool(0.0) False &gt;&gt;&gt; bool(0.01) True &gt;&gt;&gt; bool(set()) False &gt;&gt;&gt; bool(set([3,6,1,2,3])) True
A time to use `is` is when `True`, `False` and `None` are all possible values. Using just `if` will conflate `False` and `None`.
/r/learnpython might be a better bet for this question. Here's a counter-question, though: do you need to delete the values from the original list, or can you create a new list that just contains the values you want to keep?
I don't think Python allows that. 
ah, locals returns a dict, so you'll need to do `users()["GET"](blehh)`
"Why you should read PEP8"
I don't mind and it's fine it's the internet :o Thank you anyway, Have a great day :)
Just remember that if you delete elements from the list you are iterating through, things will not go well. Create a copy. List comprehensions would be useful
Slow to parse a simple web api? Optimize your code..
&gt; Python does not make primitives true objects, though, so you should only be using is on defined classes, not built-ins. You used "true" as in "true OO" (sic!) here. My point is there is no "not-true object" in Python (what you called a primitive). Or put another way: everything's an object.
For Hire Fridays maybe.
My primary profession isn't programming. But my job involves using complex proprietary software, the majority of which chose Python as the primary runtime scripting API. The quickest means to an end, in this context, makes Python the best and most obvious choice. I love the conceptual framework of Haskell. I've heard far and wide of its strengths from the wide extent of the internet. But for those of us who use Python because we must (oh and might actually enjoy using from time to time), how is your comment of any use at all?
No, they mean `not this is helping`!
As always from Norvig, this is a great read. Well organized, clear and incisive. Thanks!
 Definition: es.ping(*args, **kwargs) Docstring: Returns True if the cluster is up, False otherwise. You should be taking the return value from ping(), not expecting an exception. The exceptions seem to be happening in the background, to determine if the server is accessible. They're not really your concern. If you don't want to see the messages, you should suppress their logger.
I had a case with some code I was writing for asyncio. Basically, the function was like this: def foo(loop=None, ...): However, in this case, loop=None means "don't use asyncio." So you can supply `True`, to indicate that foo should look up the loop via `get_event_loop()`, or you can supply a loop object to use.
I agree in general, but I think this is actually a valid point that I hadn't considered before: &gt; In a language that uses “or” and “and” instead of “||” and “&amp;&amp;”, it seems logical to use “is” instead of “==”.
I don't know why, but they give OSS developers a stiffy.
I agree with your reasoning, but your results are very extreme compared to mine. If the list comparison immediately compares the ids, then the only additional overhead when doing == is just a single function call. 2ms seems very very steep for a single function call. I see an identical time as you for the identity comparison, but only 75 mics for the equality comparison; about 25 times faster.
&gt; work function I see what you did there.
Although testing a floating point number for equality or truth is a very tricky thing indeed and best avoided. It is full of surprises and 0.000000001's
It's one less thing to import, and it has the added advantage of deferring the `get_event_loop` call until later (`foo` in this case is a decorator). This way, if the client wants to install a new event loop or event loop policy, they can do so after the decorator call.
As the author, yep: Pip Installs Packages
So inside a virtualenv, Python itself is just symlinked to the version of Python used to created it, but I _think_ that `pip` gets a fresh version of `pip`, `setuptools`, (and `wheels` if virtualenv has been updated in the last month or so). Best guess from that error message is that the symlink to the actual Python interpreter is not working. I'd try something like cd /tmp virtualenv venv source venv/bin/activate python if the interpreter doesn't start, something is wrong with your virtualenv installation. If you're on Windows, I unfortunately don't know what to do.
So is acts like == in Java, and == acts like .equals() in Java. Or at least that's how I think of it.
You *might be able* to build Android (or iOS) apps in Python, but it would became full of pain soon. The problem is that you couldn’t search enough solutions when it comes to troubleshooting.
No hidden gotchas? &gt; x = 'a' * 20 y = 'a' * 20 x is y True &gt; x = 'a' * 21 y = 'a' * 21 x is y False I wouldn't say that was particularly intuitive. Similar is from [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sH4XF6pKKmk) video &gt; a = 256 b = 256 a is b True &gt; a = 257 b = 257 a is b False &gt; a = 257; b = 257 a is b True The advice is sound. The behaviour is weird in ways you wouldn't normally expect and even changes when comparing objects of the same type and value depending on how you declare them. 
You are free as in *freedom*. The server works the same in every possible operating system and browser. Nothing new to learn, as regular people learned basic Html 20 years ago.
Did you indent your entire post 4 spaces (the markup for code blocks) *except* the code? That's a first. I don't have an answer to your question though, sorry.
This is one place I disagree with the standard way of doing things. I've had some confusing experiences with empty lists etc evaluating to False in other languages, hence if I want to check vs False or True I always try to be explicit. 
I wouldn't rely on two strings with the same content actually being the same object though. This is an example of "if you know what they do". Clearly you'd want to use `==`, because you want to know if two variables have equivalent values, not the same object.
&gt; You should be checking for truthiness in **almost all cases**. What about those other cases? Also, I personally dislike checking using truthiness, I always reduce it down to a boolean. For example, instead of x = [] if x: print('non-empty') I will do x = [] if len(x) == 0: print('non-empty') My reasoning for this is because too many times I have been burned by changing a variable's type (maybe I'm switching between collection types, for example), or the function returning the value now can also return `None`, or the function returned something I didn't expect. These are subtle bugs to track down, and I'd rather save myself minutes or hours of debug time by spending the few extra seconds it takes to calculate the actual length. It's less error-prone in my experience. It also helps when most of my team members came from the embedded C/C++ world. It makes the code more readable to them. Now, I'm not saying that I have this problem often, most of the time I'm calculating a boolean and then just doing `if varname` or `if expression`, but on the rare occasion I have to handle a variable that can be truthy or `True`, and I want to handle that difference. Many may say that I should have that wrapped up in another class, but my programming style says that it's ridiculous to create a type that is only used in one location to handle something so trivially done without it. What would you suggest when a variable can contain the values `True`, `False`, `0`, or `1` and you want to tell the difference between them? I personally don't see a problem with x = random.choice([True, False, 0, 1]) if x is True: print('x is True') elif x is False: print('x is False') elif x == 0: print('x == 0') elif x == 1: print('x == 1') Do you have any alternatives?

can anyone explain these gotchas and why they behave like that?
I know nothing about this, but I saw: File "/appserver/python/lib/python3.4/site-packages/elasticsearch-1.4.0-py3.4.egg/elasticsearch/connection/http_urllib3.py", line 71, in perform_request response = self.pool.urlopen(method, url, body, retries=False, headers=self.headers, **kw) and `pool` seems like something multiprocessing or threading related. 
But as a side note it does have &amp; and | 
Note that this only happens at compile-time (only literals have this applied).
Careful - `b'\0'` and `0` should **not** be compared with `is` in Python, since they are by-value sentinels. "Sentinel" in Python normally refers to singleton objects like `None`, `object()` and `Enum` instances.
I suggest you try hard to avoid such situations.
~~The one case you'd want to do this is~~ some_bool is other_bool // EDIT: Bad some_bool == other_bool I tend to use the latter, although the former ~~is probably better style~~ a terrible idea. EDIT: Actually, use `==` in such cases since `0` and `1` are meant to duck-type `False` and `True`. 
it's not logical, == is equal, it's not by any mean "is". My age equals your age, not my age is your age. It's not that hard to understand.
Formatting note: since reddit uses markdown you have to escape your underscores outside of code blocks.

&gt; `eval()` Here's a flowchart I've found useful: Do you want to dynamically evaluate Python code? (eg. you're writing an interpreter, or exposing a debugging REPL) | no | yes --------------------- | | don't use `import code` eval still don't use eval 
edit: I think the ages example is not just unhelpful, but actually a straight-up *incorrect* explanation of the `is` operator. It sounds like you're making the point that, while `your_age` and `my_age` may refer to semantically equal values, they are not the same reference. That's correct, but the conclusion seems to be that `your_age is not my_age`; however, **the `is` operator doesn't compare reference identity**. Even if we're both 21, perhaps `your_age is my_age`, or perhaps not. Consider the following program: your_age = 21 my_age = 21 print your_age == my_age print your_age is my_age Try running it—you might be surprised! In this program, `your_age` is a reference to an object with the semantic value of the integer 21, and `my_age` is a reference to an object with the semantic value of the integer 21. The `==` operator compares the semantic values of the two referenced objects, which are identical. The `is` operator compares the identities of the two referenced objects, which, in CPython, actually *are* identical—but this only holds for certain integer values, because CPython maintains a global pool of commonly-used integer objects to share across the program, to improve performance. To my knowledge, there is no Python operator to compare the identities of two references like your English example describes; `is` doesn't actually do what your English intuition led you to believe. Technical details aside, I think the important takeaway here is that **these concepts are actually *incredibly* hard to understand from intuition alone**. What is a reference? an object? equality? identity? These definitions aren't obvious; they require a rigorous understanding of the Python specification, and articulating these concepts in English requires a whole ton of precision. For this reason, it's super unhelpful to belittle folks who are having trouble understanding these concepts; in my experience, they're the single most difficult hurdle for newcomers, because a fully correct understanding requires more rigor than usual :/
Pretty much, yes. The only difference being Python has no primitive types.
True, that is good to note, but from what I understand you generally don't want to put yourself in that situation. If you have a variable that could be something like `True` you don't want to be using that same variable to hold containers. In a strongly typed language you'd never consider doing something like that, and in python it is still a bad idea. You still shouldn't need or use "if greeting is True" but I agree that it won't always give you the same results as "if greeting" if you have messy variables. EDIT: On a side note, "is True" does appear in the [python source code](https://github.com/python-git/python/blob/715a6e5035bb21ac49382772076ec4c630d6e960/Lib/test/test_array.py), but I only found it in unit-test modules where very specific types are needed to pass tests, which make sense.
Nobody in their right mind should have been using "is" like this post described. The description of the operator is literally &gt;Evaluates to true if the variables on either side of the operator point to the same object and false otherwise. That is in no way the same concept as checking for equality.
Pip Is Pip
[you want to write a Python decorator that perfectly preserves the signature of the original function](https://github.com/micheles/decorator/blob/master/src/decorator.py#L168) (`exec code in evaldict`, close enough to `eval`) [you've written an ORM where some user-defined configurational elements are represented as Python strings so that they can be evaluated later when the variable and symbol names they refer to are available](https://github.com/zzzeek/sqlalchemy/blob/master/lib/sqlalchemy/ext/declarative/clsregistry.py#L281) [you've written a template interpreter that compiles the template language into pure Python which is then exec'ed at runtime to produce an executable template object/module](https://github.com/mitsuhiko/jinja2/blob/master/jinja2/environment.py#L937)
This == a good thing to know.
You are welcome . 
Yes, the issue is simply that technically your age is not my age, as one refers to your age, and the other refers to my age. 
You're right, == and is are two different ideas. The point of the blog post was to summarize the discussions that I've had with the dozens of Python students I teach every month, who are consistently confused by the idea, and tend to use "is" once they learn about it. The fact that Python gives seemingly inconsistent behavior for "is" surprises a lot of folks. If you understand the difference between equality and object identity, then from my perspective, you're at least an intermediate Python programmer.
Hello @BaconOnPancakes, You might be interested in **OpenId** then since all you want is about **authentication**. You check **[this](http://psa.matiasaguirre.net/docs/backends/implementation.html#openid)** out, although i would recommend doing it in **javascript**. I've made something like this before with **Flask**. You can take a look at [this](https://github.com/josuebrunel/microblog/blob/master/app/templates/login.html). **[That](https://github.com/josuebrunel/microblog/blob/master/config.py#L13-19)** was my list of *providers* Good luck
Sometimes I wish Java didn't have primitives just to avoid the whole int/Integer thing.
Fix that variable because it doesn't make any sense. 
More realistic example with the same analogy would be if you and I both had a pile of apples, we could have the same amount, but you would never question whether your pile *is* my pile.
So it's like a flag variable? And you'd always test if char is '\x00': rather than if char == '\xoo': ?
What you see as a weakness, I see as a strength. Having the ability to test for Truthy/Falsey is much better than not having it. If you don't like it, just make use of `not not` ~ `if (!!key &amp;&amp; value)` to implicitly cast Truthy/Falsey to `True/False`. Problem solved.
But nobody who knows what the two operators do would use them for strings or numbers, that was the commenters point. 
I work at CNRS in Paris, France and I've been working on this for the past few months. We've been using it to test new flight controller designs. Feel free to give it a try and let me know what you think!
No, a sentinel would be more like EmptyList = object() def f(l=EmptyList): if l is EmptyList: return [] elif l is None: raise Exception("None is bad here for some reason.") else: return l Obviously this is a very contrived example but this is what you would use them for. In you example you would just use `==`. 
For me, CodeCademz always requires a return statement, not only print. The very same approach (w/o the is true) with return instead of print worked for me when I did that exercise yesterday.
&gt; Technical details aside, I think the important takeaway here is that these concepts are actually incredibly hard to understand from intuition alone. That was precisely my point in this blog post, and I agree with your comments 100%. I'm not saying that is and == are the same. I am saying that "is" has some very specific uses, and that a very large number of people who are new to Python, or even using Python, have been using "is" in places where they shouldn't. Calling them stupid for not understanding this is really unhelpful.
that was what made more sense to me at first. But it seems to be fighting the more normal way of doing things - e.g. pycharm expect to have your virtualenv in a separate folder and it makes it harder to setup this way. Virtualenvwrapper also default to having the virtualenvs separate to the project in a .virtualenvs folder for all different virtualenvs. I guess that makes sense as you are more likely to have a virtualenv that might be used across multiple projects. 
I believe I've heard that before, but what is the reason for that?
'Cause it looks nicer. They compile to the same bytecode (at least for CPython).
Richard, a name defines a company. It has to be something primal, something that you can scream out during intercourse. Like Aviato. [Moaning] Uuuuber! [Moaning] Gooooogle! [Moaning] Huuuuuulu! Exactly, right. [Moaning] Pied Piper! I'm so sorry.
You could also try AWS free tier service and use a cron job 
&gt; Rather, I'm saying that in most cases, you shouldn't be using it. I think that's misleading though. Using `is` is not "almost never", it's actually ridiculously common. Eg. the usecase you mention of checking against "None" is something that people do very frequently, not some weird once in a blue moon case. Eg. here's a quick look at the python stdlib to get some estimation of usages: $ grep 'is None' *.py | wc -l 787 $ grep 'is not None' *.py | wc -l 508 $ grep '==' *.py | wc -l 2834 So about 30% of the time it'd use either == or is, it uses is, *just for that one usecase*. That alone seems a *long* way from "almost never" I only did it for the None case, since searching for just `is` gets you a lot of strings and comments too, but just eyeballing the results shows that None is far from the only case where it is frequently used, even in just the few pages of results. Eg a few usecases: - Checking for class or abstract base class identity (eg. `if subtype is _InstanceType` in abc.py) - Other singleton sentinel checks. Eg. "`x is NotImplemented`" or "`x is not SUPPRESS`" in argparse.py - Traversing recursive strucutres to avoid loops. Eg. in collections.py you'll note things like `while curr is not root` In short, "Almost never" seems really misleading, when the real story is likely more like "somewhere between a third and half the time".
mmmmm goodie! i'm gonna give it a try as soon as i get home :D thanks for making this!
ORMs, I just don't see the point. Just too much overhead for something that is really not that hard (SQL). If you are going to use a database as a tool don't you think you should take the time to learn how to use it properly?
Is it really that big of a performance hit though? At scale, possibly, but most of us are not deploying huge projects where we need any real optimization beyond the low hanging fruit. Obviously learning the underlying stuff is beneficial, I'm not disagreeing about that at all. 
Orm means snake in Swedish though, so you can still get a cheap chuckle out of it. ;)
Maybe the problem is, that the change to terminating never ends up in the object in the process p. And since obj.terminate() is called in the main thread you end up in an infinite loop. Use Queue or Pipes to pass information between processes.
...but `0 is False` and `1 is True` both return false, so they're not merely renames. They are different objects, so you can test explicit for booleaness if you want to. Yes, `1 == True', but that's a throwback to pre-2.3 days. `1+True == 2`, but that doesn't shape how I write code today. To be honest, both work and I'm not going to lose sleep over it. It just strikes me as odd that we tell people not to use `==` with `None` when (I think, not in front of a REPL) it will always produce the same result as `is`, yet in a case where it makes a difference people choose the less explicit operator. 
The problem is that you never set self.terminated = True before you call terminate, you need to get rid of the time.sleep(3) on line 45 and instead block until each process has set self.terminated to True. 
I'm setting it on line 23. After the while loop which should break right after I call terminate()
I was thinking the exact same thing. So now I'm hassling with Queue since i need more processes but I can't wrap my mind around it. q = multiprocessing.Queue() for x in range(multiprocessing.cpu_count()): obj = ProcessTest(n=x) q.put(obj) p = multiprocessing.Process(target=obj.go, args=(q,)) and then what?
Ah, right, I see. Yeah, that makes sense, and should work. I guess I was just hoping there was a server which would natively run with a pool of processes instead of threads, and make this trivial :)
`0` and `1` aren't singletons either (or they are on CPython, but that's an implementation detail). `1 is 1` isn't guaranteed to hold. &gt; but that's a throwback to pre-2.3 days See the links I gave.
Yes, but no thread actually prints "Core %d: ready to be terminated..." % self.n because that code is never run, just like self.terminated = True is never run, before you call termiate().
Right, that's the main problem. But for some reason while loop in go() doesn't end when I call terminate(). The behavior that i'm trying to achieve is that when I run terminate(), both processes shut down immediately because I'll need to be able to shut it down only when it's idle (while loop in go)
You can always kick the computationally intensive project to something like rq and simply have it notify the API when done.
Sometimes you just want some (controlled) shitty data to see how your ETL / data load processes handle the exceptions. This is the alpha release but interested in feedback - specifically around the python packaging and layout.

I think you do not realize who you are talking to here. Him mentioning "an ORM" and "a template interpreter" actually meant: such code *is used* in SQLAlchemy and mako. Another very popular Python package that makes use of `eval()` is six. If you think they are doing something wrong: go ahead, propose "better" code, and come up with great arguments why you think it is better.
That's interesting, although I find it a bit hard to believe that real-world applications use "is" between 1/3 and 1/2 of the time. I mean, I tend to do way more comparisons with actual values than with None. Indeed, I don't tend to do that many comparisons with None at all. But maybe that's just me. How about this: Perhaps the number of times you'll use "is" is large, but the number of use cases is very small. That's probably closer to what I meant. 
Because defaults are created at function declaration time. If your default is mutable and you expect to mutate it, then every other call to that function will now have a non-empty list.
You blog looked interesting and useful unfortunately I was too annoyed by the pop-up I couldn't fully 'x' out of to read it. 
Thanks for the feedback; I'm still working on optimizing bits of the code. snap.py is where the really hard computations are (for trajectory optimization), so if anyone's looking for a real Python optimization challenge check out the MIT paper I based the algorithm on: http://groups.csail.mit.edu/rrg/papers/Richter_ISRR13.pdf

 class Foo(object): __slots__ = () This will prevent assignment to any attributes. If you merely want to restrict assignment to a specific set of attributes, add their names to the tuple.
&gt;That's interesting, although I find it a bit hard to believe that real-world applications use "is" between 1/3 and 1/2 of the time. I just gave it a try with a largish application (calibre) in case library code is markedly different, but pretty much the same results there: 1914 for "is None", 2273 for "is not None" versus 6667 for "==", so 39% there, again just for the None case. In fact, trying a few other things, I may have *underestimated* the range. Eg in sqlalchemy, I get 788 "is not None", 558 "is None" versus only 577 "==", so it actually makes up 70% of usages there. Most of the other things I tried were around 35-40% (matplotlib, IPython, twisted). The biggest outlier in the other direction I found was numpy at just 24%. I think the use of None is just a lot higher than you might expect - a huge number of things use it, to indicate things like "no default arg passed", "nothing specified - fallback to default case", "value missing" or as a failure / no result case for lots of functions (eg. re.match, dict.get etc). Conversely, even when you're comparing values `==` may not be as common as you might think. For booleans, it's better to omit it. For integers, other comparisons often get used (ie `&lt;=` or `&gt;` etc), for objects `is` is often actually what you want, leaving just strings and enumerated values as core usecases. Give it a try on your own code - you might find you use it more than you thought. &gt;Perhaps the number of times you'll use "is" is large, but the number of use cases is very small. That's probably closer to what I meant. The problem with that is that it's very hard to quantify exactly what counts as a distinct usecase. Is any use of None a single usecase? Or should you count the different meanings assigned to None (sentinel, failure, missing value, default, database null, mapped null pointer etc)? Conversely, what is a distinct usecase of "=="? Is "`color == Green` distinct from `color == Red`? What about `age == 42` - do we count distinct types, distinct meanings, distinct values or something else? In addition, now we're not counting how *frequently* they're used, there's a large number of rarely used, but meaningfully distinct usecases for `is` in general, which need to be counted the same way. Ultimately, unless you really fudge the criteria, I don't think you can really say one way or the other which there are more usecases for.
There will always be a way for someone determined to break all rules. Since anyone could access __dict__ or __slots__ directly, you'd need to make them read-only. But this can be worked around too.
in python2, division produces integer by default, unless one of arguments is float. in python3 its not needed, as division always produces float.
I am confused. Are you and /u/scruffler the same person?
It doesn't neccessarily have to go on the list, you'd get the same result for: float(sum(list)) / len(list) But essentially one of the two values needs to be a float if you want a float result, at least in python 2. Eg. try typing "`1/2`" in the console, and compare this against what happens when you type "`1/2.0`" The reason is that when dividing two integers, by default, python will use integer (truncating) division. Ie. "`3/2` will give you 1, rather than 1.5. However, if one of the operands is already a float, python will do floating point division, and you'll get a float result. You can change the default behaviour in python2 by putting from __future__ import division at the top of your module, after which all division will allow changing type to floats. Conversely, if you want to use integer division in python3, you can use the `//` operator, which forces truncating division.
I see. So if either value is a float, then division returns a float.
I would add Mongoengine ORM for sure.
Less important how many lines of code are written, more important that the computer is doing less work.

In theory you can't solve the nested case with a regex but in practice there are recursive regular expressions :) import regex string = """The Big Bang Theory (TBBT(something)) is a show on E4.""" print regex.subf(r"\((?:[^()]++|(?R))*+\)", "", string) Isn't it a beauty? Apparently though it's not implemented in the standard re module [but maybe regex will replace re in the future according to their page](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/regex/2014.12.24). You are right about the first one though... for some reason I always do stuff like `[^\)]*` instead of using the lazy matching. So in practice I would go for the loop solution. Thats why I said OPs code was a good start.
I understand your frustration, but the stats don't lie -- having such a (hopefully unobtrusive) popup has dramatically changed the subscription numbers. I purposely *didn't* set it up to splash across the screen, which I find really annoying. I hope that you can somehow find a way to enjoy the content; I see that many people subscribe to my blog via feed readers, which should block such popups. I'm also on Planet Python, which removes everything but the text.

any suggestion for a python testing framework that can be used to test a full screen OpenGL app? expected features: - send keyboard/mouse events - OCR - easy recognition of objects (perhaps using opencv behind the curtain)
== works just as well. If there is no performance penalty this seems rather silly. 
Slots is for memory preservation, not restricting attribute assignment, that's merely a side effect of objects being created without an underlying dict 
sqlite is literally designed for this use case
The exception is generated when es.ping() gets executed - regardless of if it's assigned or not. It would make sense if it were to return false rather than an exception since the return value is boolean. What do you mean suppress the logger?
Here's how my Entries look on sqlite. http://imgur.com/z37XkIM I think it's sufficient to what I need. The only problem I was really having with it was querying it similarly to the way it was setup to the INI file. I also had problems trying to add a list to the table so I had to use json to dump it. 
I found a way around it - it's not a "nice", but it works. based on information from here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1809958/hide-stderr-output-in-unit-tests/1810086#1810086 @contextlib.contextmanager def nostderr(): savestderr = sys.stderr sys.stderr = os.devnull() try: yield finally: sys.stderr = savestderr so I am now using: try: with nostderr(): es.info() except: es=Elasticsearch("the_other_server") So running "with nostderr():" suppresses the exception stderr output in the block. It's not a nice way to deal with errors, but it works for these purposes.
Hi, If you are using Windows, an easy solution could be the Anaconda distribution (http://continuum.io/downloads). Select and install the 32 bit version. It will be easier to install the cvxopt package. Search it in the binstar repository (https://binstar.org/search?q=cvxopt). Open a console terminal and install it (e. g. "conda install -c https://conda.binstar.org/omnia cvxopt"). After that, just use it.

There's a time and place for everything, although in the case of `eval` and `exec` those places are pretty rare.

That is exactly why I wrote [Peewee](http://docs.peewee-orm.com). SQL is awesome, and by wrapping things up in Python you can get a lot more re-use than you would by manually munging string fragments. For example, following = (User .select() .join(Relationship, on=Relationship.to_user) .where(Relationship.from_user == current_user)) tweet_timeline = Tweet.select().where(Tweet.creator.in_(following)).order_by(Tweet.timestamp.desc()) The above query re-uses the subquery (for capturing a user's followers) to construct a query to build a timeline of tweets by the given users.
1. This belongs in the /r/learnpython sub 2. You're using an API that is [no longer supported](https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA214/what-is-the-desktop-api), so it's going to be a total crap shoot as to what works and what doesn't. 
Are you sure about that "Content-Type" header?
I wonder if the difference is in the implementation and environment: The ruby gems are only expected to be installable on OS X and Linux. Windows is generally not supported.

You shouldn't be getting exceptions. Find out why you are. If this is a reasonable library and you are using it correctly, it should be returning values, not raising errors for you to catch. If I were you' I'd figure this out rather than use a bare except to make it go away. You'll likely have some other trouble down the line.
That's why I came here and posted how to cause the problem with that library.
Two points to consider: SQLite is as SQL database, whereas Mongo is not. Some kinds of things are simpler with non-SQL databases, but on the other hand each one is its own special thing, whereas the basic design of SQL is standard for all SQL databases (the details can differ a bit). You can use Object-Relational Mappers, or ORMs, to provide a simpler interface to SQL databases. Dataset could be considered a simple ORM. SQLite is an embedded database - you load a file with it, and then just call it inside your code. Most databases (including Mongo) run as a separate server which your application connects to. For bigger tasks, that separation can be advantageous, but for something like what you're describing, the embedded route is probably easier. If I was doing that, I'd probably start trying to do it with SQLite, but that's partly because I've used SQLite before, so I'm already somewhat familiar with it.
requests shouldn't automatically gzip, as there is no official standard for posting compressed data. I have no idea what the server you're sending anything to is, or how it validates. But, can you just try to attach a proper filename that matches your post?? Right now it looks as if you just call it Image. Since it gives response in json, you can also use "r.json()" to get the parsed data back 
Try a metaclass with slots as well.
What dark magic is this?
If you're using it as an API independant of a reader I like http://www.reddit.com/r/python/.json better. Has some more data. All the paging variables work the same.
Impossible to know what the problem is exactly without knowing what the server expects.
But your question is phrased as "how do I suppress the error", not how do I fix it or how do I accomplish what I want to accomplish. Maybe you should open a bug on their github if the library isn't behaving well.

+1 this blog post is pourly titled and a bit alarmist. If the goal is to help beginner, then don't say it that way : it makes look like "is" is a bad thing and dangerous. It's not. A better title would be "don't use 'is' to test equality". And the 2 paragraphes to explain what it does and the only few case where you want to use it. You don't need a 1000 lines for that. It's not that a big issue. Gives the info. Done.
Lines of Code doesn't have great correlation with performance. It's what those lines of code are doing that is important. With almost every language, from Python to C, you're expressing a program in one form, and it's being converted into a final form for execution. That final form will include optimisations. What you write isn't necessarily what is run, because there are all sorts of things the interpreter or compiler can figure out from the code and carry out automatically to improve things. Here's a practical and very simple example in C where line count doesn't equal faster performance. It's called loop unrolling, which most C compilers will do for you automatically, where appropriate: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_unrolling#A_simple_manual_example_in_C In that example we've gone from 5 lines to 9, but gained in speed because a for loop contains overhead. *Before* you go off and start unrolling loops yourself, remember that compilers are doing it for C at compilation time automatically, and the same is true for the Python runtime. So how do you make stuff run smoother or faster? This is true for any language: Profiling. Oftentimes our instincts about where the application is spending the majority of its time working aren't necessarily where it is *actually* spending the majority of its time. Profiling provides you detailed information about which methods are steps are responsible for the most processing time. There's a reasonable introduction to some of the main profiling options for python here: http://marcobonzanini.com/2015/01/05/my-python-code-is-slow-tips-for-profiling/ I would also encourage you to watch this talk from Pycon 2014: [Fast Python, Slow Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eeEf_rAJds). It's only 35 minutes long, but well worth it.
#####&amp;#009; ######&amp;#009; ####&amp;#009; Section 4. [**A simple manual example in C**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_unrolling#A_simple_manual_example_in_C) of article [**Loop unrolling**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop%20unrolling): [](#sfw) --- &gt; &gt;A procedure in a computer program is to delete 100 items from a collection. This is normally accomplished by means of a *for*-loop which calls the function *delete(item_number)*. If this part of the program is to be optimized, and the overhead of the loop requires significant resources compared to those for the *delete(x)* loop, unwinding can be used to speed it up. &gt;As a result of this modification, the new program has to make only 20 iterations, instead of 100. Afterwards, only 20% of the jumps and conditional branches need to be taken, and represents, over many iterations, a potentially significant decrease in the loop administration overhead. To produce the optimal benefit, no variables should be specified in the unrolled code that require [pointer arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointer_arithmetic). This usually requires "[base](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_address) plus offset" addressing, rather than indexed referencing. &gt;On the other hand, this *manual* loop unrolling expands the source code size from 3 lines to 7, that have to be produced, checked, and debugged, and the compiler may have to allocate more registers to store variables in the expanded loop iteration [*[dubious](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Disputed_statement) – discuss*]. In addition, the loop control variables and number of operations inside the unrolled loop structure have to be chosen carefully so that the result is indeed the same as in the original code (assuming this is a later optimization on already working code). For example, consider the implications if the iteration count were not divisible by 5. The manual amendments required also become somewhat more complicated if the test conditions are variables.

Bool_three = (1 + 2 or 8 + 7) &lt;= 1
This Question would be a better fit for /r/learnpython! If you take a look at the given example, you can see that they use an comparison operator in both expressions. 1. 2 **&lt;=** 2 and "Alpha" **==** "Bravo". Those comparison operators are comparing a value and will give you True and False as a result. Next, you can chain those results with logical operators (e.g and ; or). For Example: True and True == True True and False == False False and False == False True or True = True True or False = True False or False = False Now, if you look at your bool_three, you're missing your logicial operator in your first expression. So what python does, it converts the result of 6+8 to a boolean (True or False). In numeric value, True means everything greater or lower than 0, false means exactly zero. That means, the expression 1+2 equals to True. As you use the logical operator OR your whole expression equals to true. You could for example replace it with " 1+2 == 4 or 8+7 &lt;= 1". The boolean will then hold false, as the excercise demands it. It worked out in bool_two because 6+8 results in True AND 9+10 does not equal 55 and this will result in True
Thanks. but why did Bool_three need parenthesis when bool_four didn't?
Thankyou very much for the in-depth answer. I was not aware of /r/learnpython and I will be sure to post there in the future.
I hope it was atleast a bit understandable, I am bad at explaining :(
That's a fairly old linux kernel. That means you're using Ubuntu version older than 12.04, which is the oldest release that is supported. You probably should upgrade your OS to 14.04 which is a LTS release. If you don't want to do that, there is a way to get the unmaintained (i.e. they can have security issues and bugs) packages for your Ubuntu by switching your sources from archive.ubuntu.com to old-releases.ubuntu.com. You can do it with following command: sudo sed -i -re 's/([a-z]{2}\.)?archive.ubuntu.com|security.ubuntu.com/old-releases.ubuntu.com/g' /etc/apt/sources.list And then you need to update aptitude cache: sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get dist-upgrade Afterwards try installing libcurl4-gnutls-dev or straight up python-pycurl: sudo apt-get install python-pycurl That's assuming you don't use virtualenv. If you do use virtualenv, install libcurl and any other required dependencies: sudo apt-get install libcurl4-gnutls-dev source /path/to/env/bin/activate (or workon env) pip install pycurl
Depending on what "searching the directory of the project in the code" actually means, `__file__` is your starting point (or `pkgutil`).
I just want to get the directory of where the script is at.
You'll get the root path, by import mypackage pkg_path = mypackage.__path__[0] Then just `os.path.join` your way to whatever you want. That's the case except for wheels, which I haven't figured out. It'll work fine for source code, but your icons/files will be located in stupid places.
No, but what a brilliant idea. Thanks. My main difficulty is the third person view in real life. About half way around banked turns in RC, my brain seems to flip to absolute control instead of relative control and I loose it. Most games I've looked at are usually first-person, which doesn't translate one-to-one to real life :-)
I think you are too used to dealing with professional developers rather than the audience the article was intended for. (Inexperienced people like me - who don't know the difference, but now do and even though the title says almost never can still understand it uses when needing to test object identity). Great article by the way!
cool article. Haven't used scrapy too much, but it seems like it has appropriate abstractions to model one's work.
I find it harmful that tutorial is teaching to cach **all** exceptions and not only those that originate from `Exception` https://www.google.com/search?q=pokemon+exception+handling
What do you mean *disrupt*? And what are you trying to hack?
PySide (Qt for Python) should do this easily.
In addition to QtWebKit, you could also use cefpython https://code.google.com/p/cefpython/ Edit: This one looks really cool too: https://github.com/breach/thrust
Should have converted it to XML instead. ^^^^/s
https://code.google.com/p/gui2py/
It isn't clear exactly what you want from the question. You should explain your problem fully. The multiprocessing module is a real piece of junk at practically every level, and not reliable at all. (One might ask, "What should I use instead?" That depends exactly what one is using it for.)
PySide or PyQt is your best bet for this. I just knocked this together in PyQt5 as a demo: from PyQt5.QtCore import * from PyQt5.QtWidgets import * from PyQt5.QtGui import * from PyQt5.QtWebKitWidgets import * import os import sys class MainWindow(QMainWindow): def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs): super(MainWindow,self).__init__(*args, **kwargs) self.browser = QWebView() self.browser.setUrl( QUrl("http://google.com") ) self.setCentralWidget(self.browser) self.show() self.setWindowTitle("Mozarella Ashbadger") self.timer = QTimer() self.timer.setInterval(10 * 1000) # milliseconds self.timer.timeout.connect( self.browser.reload ) self.timer.start() app = QApplication(sys.argv) app.setApplicationName("Mozarella Ashbadger") app.setOrganizationName("Mozarella") app.setOrganizationDomain("mozarella.org") window = MainWindow() app.exec_() 
I use [Ghost.py](http://jeanphix.me/Ghost.py/): gh = Ghost() gh.open(url) img = gh.capture() ba = qt.QtCore.QByteArray() buff = qt.QtCore.QBuffer(ba) buff.open(qt.QtCore.QIODevice.WriteOnly) img.save(buff, 'JPG') b64data = ba.toBase64().data() And display it with `&lt;img src="data:image/png;base64,FABRa8..." /&gt;`
is it really? 
oh god... I've created a monster :D
so you want a cute browser. But why? 
In Python, the initializer of a base class must be explicitly called. This is different from a number of other languages where the base constructor is implicitly called at the start of the child's constructor. In this code, the author is choosing to initialize a few instance variables before initializing the base class. The base class is being explicitly initialized, but [super()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#super) could be used instead in order to provide more flexibility if the class needs to change.
Another vote for [cefpython](https://code.google.com/p/cefpython/), I've used it and definitely recommend it, specially for "modern websites" as it is a python binder for the Chromium Embedded Framework. Before you try PySide or PyQt on its own, have a little search about their webkit version and search for an example app that loads any page, so that you can test the specific website you'd want to load. I found out that the javascript and css frameworks I was did not work that well, but that was an specific problem on my dependencies and should work fine for a lot of cases. Cefpython itself is only the "webview", so you still need a GUI toolkit. The cefpython website and repository contain examples using different frameworks, the wxpython being the most prevalent and feature-rich one, but if you don't need to worry about OS X, there are good simple examples in PyQt and Kivy for Windows and Linux. If you decide to go the wxpython route, I had to combine the windows, linux and mac wx examples into one that works cross-platform, as there are some differences to take into consideration ([link to the source code](https://github.com/carlosperate/ardublockly/blob/master/start_cef.py) if you interested). Full disclosure, I stopped using cefpython with wx because I need to pack the applications in self contained executables. I was using py2exe and pyinstaller and run into quite a few issues getting the builds to run on multiple distributions with different versions of libc (even though I was building with older versions for backward compatibility) and other issues on os x (windows was fine). So I moved to Electron (nodejs), having it launch the python server executable on the background, and saved me a lot of headaches. As a separate question, if a simple reload is all you need, why not install a firefox or chrome plugging to reload the tab?
Or, if you want to use PyQt4 (supports 2.7 and 3.x), change the imports to: from PyQt4.QtCore import * from PyQt4.QtGui import * from PyQt4.QtWebKit import * /u/mfitzp's code should now work.
Hey, well at least we might be able to use something like [Nuitka](http://nuitka.net/) and use libpython then run Python in the browser. Though we already have [PyPyJS](http://pypyjs.org/), which is rather slow right now. I am hoping python makes it into the web just as fast on a normal computer.
I created a quick project to detail the flow -&gt; https://github.com/mjhea0/flask_flow As far as your project is concerned - 1. When the server is ran, the outer *\_\_init\_\_.py* file is loaded, which imports the application instance from */couponmonk\_project/\_\_init\_\_.py*. 1. From there the views are imported and when the end user requests the main route, `/`, a GET request is sent. This is handled by the route handler - `@app.route('/')` - and a response is sent. 
Seconded. This screams XY Problem.
Web2py or flask web2py and flask simple and runs on both Linux and Windows
the class declaration class HttpClient(asyncore.dispatcher): states that HttpClient extends asyncore.dispatcher. If you overload an \_\_init\_\_ method, you usually want to call the base class' version somewhere in yours, else the base class doesn't get properly initialized. Calling asyncore.dispatcher.__init__(self) in python is (roughly) equivalent to the perhaps more familiar practice of calling super() in other languages. what /u/unholysampler suggested is instead calling super().__init__(self) which accomplishes the same thing, but tends to be more flexible if you have to deal with multiple inheritance.
Thanks a ton - I've never seen this before in other languages. But it makes sense. How does super play a role and is it best practices to use super in my code moving forward? 
Short of having to download a huge database, I would use an API provided by an existing dictionary/thesaurus service. One of the first and most developer-friendly I found was [wordnik](http://developer.wordnik.com/). I would suggest signing up for an API key, and then use the Python library they provide on [GitHub](https://github.com/wordnik/wordnik-python). Or if you rather implement your own lightweight retrieval methods, they do have a general JSON interface, documented [here](http://developer.wordnik.com/docs.html). An example of one of the API calls might look like [this](http://api.wordnik.com:80/v4/word.json/Python/definitions?limit=200&amp;includeRelated=true&amp;useCanonical=true&amp;includeTags=false&amp;api_key=a2a73e7b926c924fad7001ca3111acd55af2ffabf50eb4ae5)
Your `palette_color_func` function almost seems unnecessary. It's not inherently wrong to use partials, because that's what they were invented for -- however, consider what you're actually trying to do. Most of the key word arguments of that function aren't even used. Also, your `Palettes` class implements `dict` but why do you only support integer based keys? Why couldn't my palette be called "Coffee?" Validating the RGB values was clever, the rest is kinda fluffy.
`super()` will return the next class in the look up order. If you aren't doing multiple inheritance, this works exactly the same as `super` in Java. `super()` has two main benefits: * If you decide to change the base class, no changes need to be made to the implementation of your `__init__()`. Explicitly calling the initializer of a class that is not the base class is valid Python, but not what you want. * If someone else uses your class as part of a multiple inheritance chain, your class will not cause problems for that person.
You're extremely helpful. Thank you. 
What are the hidden characters? Are they spread throughout, or only at the beginning? Is it the [Byte Order Mark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_order_mark) ? 
I'll definitely fork it and put some work in. Looking up minimum-snap shows me I'm not familiar with some of the concepts being implemented but I'm committed to learning it now
I am a working physicist and I do a fair amount of coding in Python. Welcome :). Python vs. Fortran - these days, Fortran is largely reserved for theorists doing some very heavy computational work. The sort of things that make supercomputers and clusters crank for hours and days. For more run-of-the-mill work, Python and Matlab are probably the most popular choices. However, Matlab is proprietary software, and Python is not. Python version - 2.7 is probably still the most widely deployed version, but 3.x is the future. The major libraries such as scipy and numpy are available in both 2.7 and 3.x versions. Scipy and numpy are libraries that can be added to Python (just make sure you download the versions compatible with the version of Python you choose to install). They make math easier and much, much faster on Python. There are some distributions of Python, such as IPython and Spyder, that come bundled with numpy and scipy (and other useful features). Scipy.org maintains a lot of useful [documentation](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/), [tutorials](http://wiki.scipy.org/Cookbook), and examples. I have seen books on scientific computing with Python, but have never read one myself. Maybe I should :/. As always - learn to code by coding. Project Euler is excellent.
The signature could be changed, def palette_color_func(random_state=None, palette=None, **kwargs): Then, the base logic is, if palette not in Palettes.keys: generate_random_pallete # ala random state? else use the palette Since you're already validating Palettes, anything in the Palettes object should be correct. If it's not pre-defined, then it can just pick one; or make a default palette that's a fallback when none is supplied...after all, that is a valid keyword argument in the signature. You could even have the `Palettes` class define a default color palette that could be "updated" so when the function to get a palette from the class is called without arguments, it loads the default. Then you wouldn't have to use partial anymore.

you could always just try chucking PyPy at the original script and see if it speeds up too.
The json implementation in the standard library parses an entire JSON document at once. This "different JSON library" allows you to parse iteratively, so you can process documents that are larger than your memory.
For those reading and wondering why, if your string is: "I like apples (red ones) and bananas (orange ones). I hate carrots." and you search without the "lazy operator" (`?`), your regex will pick up: "(red ones) and bananas (orange ones)" Because its default behaviour is greedy - i.e. it will match as much of the regex as it can.
The code in block 13 can be rewritten in a more pythonic way. Instead of initialising a counter and increment the counter in the loop: sc_id = 0 output = '' for sc_name in sc_names: output += '%d %f %f\n' % (sc_id, sc_coors[sc_name]['lat'], sc_coors[sc_name]['lng']) sc_id += 1 use enumerate: output = '' for sc_id,sc_name in enumerate(sc_names): output += '%d %f %f\n' % (sc_id, sc_coors[sc_name]['lat'], sc_coors[sc_name]['lng'])
Only if you actually have permission to write to the socket. Plus it depends on how the application is accessing the socket data. If they're using some of Python's objects that wrap the lower level socket interface then input from the socket may already be filtered out before it reaches the application. If not then the application author is, usually, going to discard any input they don't understand rather than try to process it because it's easier. Finally, if you have permission to access the socket you probably have access to better/easier ways of disrupting the application rather than sending input to the socket. Killing the process or removing resources, such as files on disk that the application uses, would probably be the easiest. Or if you don't care about collateral damage a fork bomb would work too probably as would anything else that causes a resource availability problem.
You can build the community. We need a subreddit.
Hey there! I just had a quizz of something like that. Try this code, it may help you. It opens file, store each line into a string and then split the words of the string and it takes the type of a list. open_file = open("turing.txt", "r") stri= "" #create empty string to manipulate data for line in open_file: stri+=line word_stri = stri.split() #split the string and convert it into list open_file.close()
awesome!
Hey erdaron, Thanks for the reply. If you don't mind me asking, whats having a job doing computational physics like? i love physics and have always been interested in computers, but mostly the hardware side and have never got round to actually learning coding The guy who took our computing class showed us his simulation of forced star production, it was pretty awesome, took 4 weeks on some super computer to run lol. Ill check out Ipython and Project Euler edit: Is python easy to use on windows? i have a crappy laptop with linux installed that i used for Fortran, would it be best to use that?
Did you really just link to your post in another sub? Were you hoping we'd brigade on your behalf?
Great thanks empet15
I havn't really done any data analysis yet, will this work as a primer to the topic as well as introducing it in python?
The sockets used are not public, they're from a [socketpair](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/socketpair.2.html), which means they are anonymous and have no address. They are inherited from parent to child, so unless you are a child of the Python process, you don't have access to them. This is really more of a form of a bidirectional pipe (which is also anonymous) than a socket. But you can still disrupt communications. Multiprocessing also uses things like a shared memory-mapped file, and you can figure out that file's name and open it. It will be named something like `pym-&lt;unique identifier&gt;` under the temporary directory. However, this is all pointless. The file will be owned by the user and group of the person running the Python program, and that file will be only readable by that person and group. So either the attacker is the same user, in which case all bets are off — you could attach to the Python process with a debugger and change any aspect of the program, regardless of multiprocessing or not; or you're not the same user and there's nothing you can do to disrupt another user; or you're root and you can do anything you want regardless of multiprocessing. So worrying about the specific implementation details of multiprocessing seems pointless — if you have the permission to do that, there are much worse things you can do. 
I've never heard of this before. Let me give it a try and report back thanks!
WOW so after installing all the dependencies needed to run the script pypy cataloged the file in roughly 10-15 seconds. That's a HUGE improvement over the original script. Now the problem that I have is I guess I have to create a different type of GUI to work with the script now because some of the dependencies I was using to create the GUI in pyqt are not supported by pypy from what I hear. I hear numpy isn't compatible because they wanted to preserve the performance. 
I know right? But pyramid is sooo much better, why ever use anything else? =)
In all fairness, people have thought about this sort of problem in XML a lot more than they have they have thought about it in JSON. XML may be terrible, but JSON has the mindset of "just work dammit" without thinking about *how* it should work, and as a result making several terrible decisions.
Love this! Thank you for sharing!
You can use sql alchemy as your model back end in Django if you want to to do that 
See what 'async for' is semantically equivalent to: https://docs.python.org/3.5/reference/compound_stmts.html#async-for Answering your question -- no, it does not support parallelism.
That's what I figured, but it seems unfortunate. Someone proposed that for [ECMAScript](https://github.com/tc39/ecmascript-asyncawait/issues/8) and it sounded perfect. 
And the Default field. Maybe we should get crazy and sanitize any input provided by the user.
Crazy!
Python bytecode would need to include python itself - you'll need interpreter, regardless of the bytecode format, and this will make whole thing large, slow and not very practical. So it will make running python from the webbrowser possible, but less practical then using statically compiled languages which don't need any runtime (c/c++/rust etc).
It's not a strong claim, it's based entirely on known facts. The WebAssembly specification currently implements the exact same semantics as asm.js. There is no way to compile Python to asm.js without including all of CPython, so there is no reason to expect that will change one bit. You could theoretically write a compiler that does that, but that would be an extraordinary amount of work and nobody would ever undertake it because it would be pointless. You can just use one of the existing transpilers which would be far more efficient, since both Python and JavaScript are dynamic scripting languages. 
&gt; Jython compiles to JVM bytecode, which is very different than asm.js. I get that, but WebAssembly isn't going to be asm.js forever. My understanding is that it's going to be a bytecode interpreter. And yes, you'd need to bootstrap a runtime- but I'd fully expect runtimes to be build for WebAssembly. Yes, that impacts loadtimes, and it's not happening on a short time horizon, but I fully expect to see that on a 5ish year window.
Wonderful project. Will be waiting to see it evolve. Thanks for sharing.
You'd also use properties in cases where you don't want the user to be able to change the value of an attribute. Maybe they set something when they init the object and you don't want them changing it.
What version of Python? Your first line looks like 2, and your third line looks like 3. What's the exit code?
version 3.4.2 and whats an exit code ? 
Nice...I hate R.
Remove `-i` from the command. `python -i` starts the interactive Python shell, but doesn't run the script. `python tinyscript.py` should do what you want.
and i do all of this in that black thing right ? O_o 
Yep. Are you using Windows?
this is what i have (1) http://i.imgur.com/Pf7qS0I.jpg (2) http://i.imgur.com/7zchePk.jpg 
this is what i have (1) http://i.imgur.com/Pf7qS0I.jpg (2) http://i.imgur.com/7zchePk.jpg 
Oh! You're already running the Python interactive shell. I was assuming you were on the command line. This is a more in-depth subject than I can explain in a Reddit comment. Google "Windows command line tutorial" - that should help you get started.
oh ok. but other than that, everything else looks correct riohgt ? ' 
Do you really need the fuzzy part (ie: for digital forensic)? I never try ssdeep, but if you are ctually only need to compare exact hash then hashlib *maybe* faster. 
Thank you. Just me trying to premature optimized :-) 
I've been using PyMC 2 quite a bit, and it's great. I'm hoping (and assuming, perhaps incorrectly) that PyMC 3 will also allow the use of arbitrary imported functions in the calculation of deterministic variables (there's one function in particular that's buried deep in scipy that I definitely need). Anyone know if this is a safe assumption?
Been building Django apps for a while, just picked up Flask last week. I really, really enjoy it. I would recommend the mega flask tutorial. Then go through a quick flask-admin tut and you have a super powerful toolbelt with a small amount of boilerplate. 
sqlite?
Wat, I think relations works there...?
Well, you don't have to download jquery for every site that uses it because good practice is to link to Google's version. So it gets downloaded once and cached, and then it's there for every other site that links to the same script. Something similar could happen for a python interpreter. I could even see chrome and firefox bundling it in their installer, as there will be a lot of cool stuff written for sites in python once it becomes possible. 
We have a proxy that is automagic under Windows, but does not work from Linux. Trust me, I tried.
Doesn't PyPi give package dependencies? Write a script to download and compress everything, then bring it to work on a disk? I know there is a more practical solution though...
There won't be anything quite so simple as PHP with regard to working with Apache, but there are much simpler options than Django. Check out [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/). It's much simpler.
Your informed criticism has convinced me to give up bayesian statistics.
I'm off to bed...BUT, there's a django tutorial out there that shows you how to set up a really basic static site serve-er. It will render the templates and serve every .html file in /templates, /views just like PHP I'll definitely look for it in the morning if you're still stuck.
It's actually easier to create a website with flask that with PHP. It's just harder to deploy. But creation is definitly easier : you don't need to install apache or mysql, you can just install python, download flask and it works.
'Create relations between tables' sounds fine to me!
USB?
I love this. I can see myself using it in a project. Well done and thanks for sharing!
Download binaries as wheels if you are on Windows (like I am)
That's great :) It took me about a week working full time to decipher that MIT paper and write the algorithm in Python. It was worth it though; I honestly think their method cannot be improved.
Have you tried using cntlm on the windows machine as a tunnel for the Linux machine? That's what I do at work to get around the firewall
Webassembly is nearly exact equivalent of normal assembly, so just like now you need python interpreter to interpret its bytecode, you'll need it there too. Perhaps you're confusing webasssembly bytecode with java bytecode - those two things are at entirely different levels of abstraction. Java bytecode is an high level abstraction, understanding things like classess and method calls, webassembly is extremely thin abstraction over machine instructions.
You're so right. Everyone who toils away at statistics forgets that simpler solutions exist and that it's not that they are looking at more complex domains than modeling housing prices! They are so foolish.
see what you get when you wget http://wpad/wpad.dat The contents of that file should tell you the proxy settings. e: i see it might also be called proxy.pac or wpad.da. e2: or it could be another host but you should be able to get that information from dhcp (option-252), this should be in the generated leases file in /var somewhere (on debian it's /var/lib/dhcp/dhclient.if.leases)
Use a templating engine like [Mako](http://www.makotemplates.org/) From their docs: &lt;table&gt; % for row in rows: ${makerow(row)} % endfor &lt;/table&gt; However, these are generally used sparingly, for things like displaying a table to the user. Writing a webapp like this is a ridiculous design. Use Flask if Django is too heavy weight.
worked perfectly, many thanks !
Absolutely agree. See https://www.owasp.org/index.php/PHP_Security_Cheat_Sheet#URL_routing for more info on why PHP's method is bad. (That page gives advice for dealing with the issues, but I'd recommend you read it as "reasons to stay away from PHP" instead). The reasons listed on that page aren't theoretical - I've seen plenty of examples of all the issues. It's true that PHP's deployment method has an enviable convenience. But it's only true in the sense that a house that doesn't have a lock on the front door is more "convenient" than one that does.
When you say that senior positions involve appling "a Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno (BFGS) algorithm", I take it you mean that you define your own cost function and then use BFGS to optimize it? If so, that may be true, but that idea, which centers on optimization, is really only tertiarily related to the sampling package being presented here.
If you have apache already installed, give new "mod_wsgi express" a shot: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mod_wsgi/ (see "Using mod_wsgi express with Django" section). It's a production ready setup, but very easy to run.
Why's that?
looks awesome! any link to try this? (or even source to try this at home?)
Or you can open up a port via ssh and set your browser proxy settings to use that port. Example: ssh -D 9090 &lt;remoteserver&gt; Then set your browser proxy settings to use local host socks5 on port 9090. The poor man's VPN! Download what you need via the web browser. 
First thing is in python3 `print` is a function. You use it like print("some content") You mixed up python2 print which work as statement and python3 function-like print. Which don't work in python3. That's all. And BTW it is worth to add #!/usr/bin/env python3 As first line of your script
Hey, looks good! How are you pulling in scores? Also, can you give any details on selenium? Do you mean it automatically updates scores without refreshing the browser?
Shouldn't the example be `Person.from_json(…)`? Why create an empty instance first?
