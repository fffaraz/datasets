Selenium. And read the sidebar. And post things like this in /r/learnpython And read that sidebar, too.
The monkey-patching is optional, which is why it's optional. `with_column(df, 'x', Col()+3)` works, too. The (admittedly limited) test suite makes no assumption that you will do the monkey-patching. The metaclass is definitely not necessary. I'm not necessarily sure I want to *inherit* from `pd.Series`, since logically a `Col` is very much not a `Series`, in the same way that `pd.Series.str` is very much not a `str`. I wanted to make sure that the dunder methods were present directly on `Col` (since dunders ignore both `__getattr__` and `__getattribute__`). The thought crossed my mind that the "correct" way to implement this was to explicitly write a `Col` method for every `Series` method I wanted to proxy. In fact that's originally what I had done, then I switched to the metaclass for some reason that I honestly can't remember right now. It wasn't offensive *enough* to make me want to switch back. I'm open to your thoughts on this.
Just tried hello world for the first time lol. Not a joke though just started 
&gt; For example, if you group by A and average B, you get a series that you have to reindex and rename. Is this what you mean? df = pd.DataFrame({ 'a': [1,1,1,2,2,3,3], 'b': np.random.randn(7)}, index=list('abcdefg')) y_mean_by_x = df.groupby('x')['y'].mean().rename('y_mean_by_x') df = df.join(y_mean_by_x , on='x') Because in theory `Col` could let you do something like what Dplyr does: df.groupby('x').mutate(y_mean_by_x=Col('y').mean()) which wouldn't be that hard to add to Anaphora.
Yeah, it's definitely a case-by-case kind of thing. If I know that my dataframe row-count is going to be less than 1 million, then I know the comprehension will take negligible time (if I'm just doing interactive analysis). And I think the comprehension is more readable than the 'data.apply' solution with the lambda function that I was replying too (and will probably be just as, if not more, performant). It looks like there is also an `np.where` function that can be used for if/else type behavior where: np.where(condition, x, y) is equivalent to: [xv if c else yv for (c,xv,yv) in zip(condition,x,y)] But I've never used this and don't know what the performance is like. And I do think it's a little clunky to jump into a 'numpy' function for such a data-frame centric operation. Good luck with your package - always good to have people experimenting with different APIs to evolve things. 
Neat! I've been using selenium at work and it's gone pretty well! I wonder if you could get a decent following on an Instagram meme page by just automatically reposting shit from Reddit. I mean I know people do that but to see it automatically is sick!
Colon at the end of that part?
You're missing a colon at the end of your elif

I know! I'm having WordPress issues since Monday. Something to do with the PHP version changing, though I haven't had time to look into it.
As I posted elsewhere in the thread, you can use the `Series.where` or `Series.mask` methods instead of `np.where`: data['x'] = data['a'].where(data['b'] &gt; 4, other=np.nan) It's still much faster than looping rowwise, even though you end up making a second pass over the data (once to compute the condition on `b` and again to compute the result). The first argument to `where` can also be a callable, so if you needed the result to be from `a` instead of `b`, you still end up with the same algorithmic efficiency (in theory) as the list comprehension. The real fun part is when you need to dispatch on *multiple* conditions. Either you end up chaining `Series.mask`/`Series.where`, or you use `np.select`.
You're entering the territory of browser emulation, and/or javascript evaluation, to accomplish this. 
No offense OP, I think it's awesome that you are trying to learn python and make cool stuff. But why is there this fascination with sharing introductory code on /r/python? It seems unreasonably popular.

You can use the [`__set_name__`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__set_name__) method on a descriptor like PyField to avoid having to explicitly set the name: class MyDescriptor: def __init__(self, name=None): self.name = name def __set_name__(self, cls, name): if self.name is None: self.name = name
Gald to be of help!
Likely because it appeals to beginners like me who get to see what fellow beginners are able to create, providing inspiration that is achievable in a potentially short space of time. I’m interested to see what beginners are able to do.
What a dick.
You seem like a helpful, amazing person who's trying to make the world a better place.
Hey interesting project! Wondering where you find the proxylist and if those proxies are free and how you test if it's working? Thanks.
Agreed, but if you’re looking to use this project to learn Python or get into web development, I would check out Flask.

I highly recommend posting your question there. Please follow the subs rules and guidelines when you do post there, it'll help you get better answers faster. Show /r/learnpython the code you have tried and describe where you are stuck. **[Be sure to format your code for reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/faq#wiki_how_do_i_format_code.3F)** and include which version of python and what OS you are using. *** ^(this bot is written and managed by /u/IAmKindOfCreative) ^(This bot is currently under development and experiencing changes to improve its usefulness)
This would be really cool if you were able to make it run after a meme reaches a certain amount of karma. Everybody knows the Instagram accounts mostly get their content from Reddit anyway. What make this even cooler would be if you got a large enough following that you start making income off your meme account and then promote another account but it's really just another one of yours and keep repeating until you have a massive autonomous income generator using memes. Meme.io
I've basically made the same but I'm using the instagram API to upload which makes the whole process cleaner and easier. I'll dm you on IG
ok
Yeah I was wondering the same! Unfortunately there’s still a few kinks I haven’t quite sorted out yet so there’s a few blunders here and there. Sometimes the list for a subreddit will contain less images because it had to filter some out because the posts weren’t images themselves so it just skips over the item and doesn’t replace it with an image. So when it goes to post something on Instagram, it might call for a meme# that doesn’t exist and throw an error. So I either need to implement a system that checks for what’s called and compares it to what I actually have, or a system that makes up for the missing items. Or both!
Yeah I just used that a couple hours ago. Just haven’t updated the git. So much cleaner that way!
Because most people aren't like you and like to encourage newcomers.
Well mainly because a couple people asked for it. I wouldn’t really have done it otherwise. I suppose it’s popular because people often don’t know what they wanna build when they first get into programming, so seeing something so simple yet quite applicable can be very inspirational and motivational. I guess? I just wanted to share the clip at first because I was proud, though. I’m sure it’s been done before but I found no publication of it while making mine.
Have at it, buddy. 
How? sorry I am new to programming and python
Ooh that's pretty cool. I would definitely think about incorporating that behaviour - at least as a fall back. I think it's common for people to want to have a different text style for their configurations vs their python code, and I like giving people the option to differentiate the two. For example if someone uses capital letters for the class attribute, and lowercase for the 'serialised' version of an integer, it's clear if when looking up a value, if the name is in caps - you'll get an `int` and when it's lowercase, you'll get a `str`. 
[removed]
There are other unofficial Instagram python APIs (pings - private Instagram API) that you can use to post content etc. Then you don't have to worry about point and click.
Solved that awhile ago. Just haven’t published it. Thanks though!
As a noob.py I think this is pretty neat!

HA. That’s the dream. Probably not there but I’ll see what I can do.
Yeah I saw that and that was pretty nice but leaving a comment saying "Ew!" isn't helpful or constructive criticism.
Well that I have. The problem is it just skips over that iteration and leaves it blank. So I set it to download 10, but 4 of those 10 might not have an image, so it only downloads six. So when it looks for a meme with #7 and it doesn’t have it, it throws an error.
Really annoying indeed, I get one of those at the top of my front page like twice per week now. For some reason I end up looking at the code every time, ho boy... https://i.imgur.com/ESiYZCQ.gif
Nice tool. But please get rid of that crazy red stuff flying around in the background.
All the stats are jacked up at the moment so everything is subject to change. I only started this project on the 6th. 
Omfg nicely commented code!?! Variable names that make sense!?! I didn't even play it yet and i love it 😬
Use CSS or X-Path instead of coordinates and try to run Selenium in headless mode (might not work for insta) which should make things a lot more efficient.
If you're using Selenium with Firefox, look into Firefox profiles. There's plenty of tutorials how to use a specific Firefox profile, this should help you get around the problem you're having.
Very similar, cheers for the heads up.
Because that’s the point. To learn and share. I really hope you realize how distasteful your comment is. Your comment is the kind that discourages beginners from sharing and learning amazing wonderful things because you feel it isn’t worthy of this particular subreddit. Seriously should be ashamed. 
ill google around but if you have any good resources that would be much appreciated
Wow really! Thank you very much!!!!!! I’m super new still so I’m glad I’m doing something right!

Built my own port scanning utility because I haven't found a good one on PyPl for python, link: [https://github.com/Aperocky/PortScan](https://github.com/Aperocky/PortScan), to install, use `pip install portscan`.

Why all the sleeps? As someone who uses Selenium daily for their job the sleeps are killing me to see.
Well it was getting caught up every now and then because it was moving to fast to perform the actions. So I put short sleeps in between each movement/click. &amp;#x200B;
What line of your code makes it run every hour? Is it some time.sleep()?
Yes, absolutely, although I think you would be far better off choosing a free/cheap online training course or a book. Deep Learning Vol. 1: From Basics to Practice by Andrew Glassner is great, it's a very visual book and it walks you through the basic statistics concepts you'll need to understand to understand modern data science. I think you can get it for free with an Amazon Kindle trial. So, as far as calculus: calculus is critical for data science, as many self-learning algorithms use a process of calculating the slope of something called **information loss** in order to estimate the **plane of error**. This is where your self-training model is incorrectly classifying / predicting the certainty of an output of a model, and deciding how wrong it really was. It uses this information to identify the factors which lead to the wrong decision, and updates the **weights** which lead to a confident but incorrect decision. This is all pretty deep stuff that you won't necessarily touch with high level tools, and it doesn't apply to all data science: it's just pretty darn common. Algebra will be essential. You'll be pre-processing your input data with things like dividing by the mean of your data and other algebraic expressions in your program. Algorithms are incredibly useful. Parallel processing, loops, path finding, kernels - you'll find all sorts of algorithms in data science, although casual data scientists may just be statisticians with no more algorithmic knowledge than calculating error and projecting planes. All of that to say, you shouldn't be intimidated by any terms you don't know. There are hundreds of resources out there for learning about these concepts, and they all explain them in slightly different ways. Eventually, something will click. As far as a Python road map, here's what I think: Libraries to be familiar with are Pandas, scikit-learn, word2vec, Pillow, OpenCV, NumPy, SciPy. Once you understand the core concepts (warning: NumPy does rows first, then columns \[y first, then x in traditional Cartesian\]) you're read to move onto Keras with TensorFlow as the backend, or even TensorFlow if you can do matrix multiplication. Once you have a basic machine learning and deep learning libraries under your thumb, you can move onto threading / multiprocessing / Numba for parallel work and Cython / Nuitka for C-based work, and some GUI work like Tkinter / Kivy. Then you're onto some web work like Flask / Django. Now you're a full stack developer and you do whatever you want. Statistics is really the most important thing, it affects how you choose your data - an data is everything in data science. Hope this helps!
That is actually done using Windows Task Scheduler, which is another beast entirely. 
I would very much like to know about it. Can you please share some article or tutorial link? TIA.
No problem, I got it. A simple Google did the trick. Thanks man.
Post your entire code and then we can look at it. Otherwise... very hard to help.
Check out /r/learnpython , they’ll help you out. But basically the command prompt or vs code if you’re running your files through it can’t find your python install. It needs to be added to your windows environment variables. I can’t help if you’re running it via vscode, but it should be easy enough to find out the fix. Google “running python files in vscode” or your error + vscode.
My entire code is: print("Hello World")
It sounds like you didn't made sure your python path was enabled when you did your install. You can open python by navigating to the folder it is in and type python.exe. 
&gt;if you have telegram or discord could we chat there? I am trying to set this up. Brand new here would you be able to provide a tutorial for an Android phone and a chromebook? Also would this work for other trivia apps as well?
I can run python in CMD but I am trying to get it to run in VSCode.
&gt;All the stats are jacked up at the moment so everything is subject to change. I only started this project on t WOW man I love it! So I have a question for you. I am working on the map at the moment. I want to make a some what random gen to make the map but i want the map to be stored in a file after it has been generated. What do you suggest to store the data in? I currently using sqlite3 at the moment but I'm not sure if that's the best thing to use. i chose it because I know it only loads the data it needs instead of loading in the hole file. BUTTTT like I said I'm not sure what its the best approach is.
Dude that is very nice of you to say!!!!! Thank you!!!!! 
Great work sir!!!
 if DAE think retards are gay: me.fuck()
Look into implicit vs explicit waits. You could also just wrap this into a helper this way you don’t have many lines of click &amp; sleep. 
I was just about to ask about this. &amp;#x200B;

Hey frozenronin I’ve literally started the exact same project, I wouldn’t like to collaborate unfortunately as I’ve done the same as you and learnt python myself so I would like to complete the app myself to prove to myself I have the necessary skills. However, I would love to hit you up a bit further down the line and maybe compare code, do you have an email address or anything I can drop a line to?
I wish I could upvote this more!
Have you considered directly creating obj files? They're very simple.

Welcome :) &amp;#x200B;
We all are :)
Go ahead. Keep me posted with your feedback! Will be happy to learn more and improve it further.
Configurability with sane defaults is the best of both worlds!
Yes, because it's overly complicated for no good reason, meaning bugs will exist and for no purpose
If we need to make it to using, I will do it. And recommend to me some helpful docs that make \`genesis-py\` .
Wat?
It would be advantageous. Until we can have an embedded device that can run python "code" independent of an OS and instead use a debugger (like used for C) then it may be viable. But Im still new in the industry, we will see what happens.
Just a suggestion.. You can add a GUI to let the user select subreddits 
Men this is great, i Will be honored if you let me help.. just let me know.
Everything should be as simple as possible, but not simpler. Look at the confusing mess that is the latest C++ standard.
I can help you with GUI I've done a noobie module with Tkinter And keep the script safe just in case you plan on selling or making money out of it I'm just a beginner in Python And know lots of Java and C,C++ (Don't have developer experience as such) And tbh things the users can modify always improves the UX a bit only to the extent that it is not too much a bother 
ReactOS is not reactjs (what react-native is about).
Why not use nmap? 
&gt; that line is only there in order to return a domain instance from the repository instead of a SQLalchemy object. You don't need to do this, though. It would make more sense to use [classical mappings](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/orm/mapping_api.html). This lets you map your domain objects to SQLAlchemy *from the outside* instead of having an inheritance relationship. That way you can just load your domain objects directly from your repository. This is simpler than having a separate DTO, and SQLAlchemy is then able to perform relationship mapping and dirty checking properly. ie. instead of class Parent(Base): __tablename__ = 'child' id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True) parent_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('parent.id')) # Domain models class ParentDomain: def __init__(self, id, children=None): self.id = id self.children = children or [] @classmethod def from_dict(cls, d): return ParentDomain( id=d['id'], children=[ChildDomain.from_dict(c) for c in d.get('children')] ) you can use *this* style of mapping # Your domain objects are plain Python objects with no inheritance # baggage, and no dependency on any framework. class Parent: def __init__(self, children=None): self.children = children class Child: def __init__(self, parent): self.parent = parent # in your mappings.py you can explicitly declare your tables # and the way that they map to your objects. This means that you can # change the structure of your domain and the structure of your db # independently, without needing the additional DTO layer. parent_table = Table('parent', metadata, Column('id', integer, primary_key=True) ) child_table = Table('child', metadata, Column('id', integer, primary_key=True), Column('parent_id', integer), ) mapper(Parent, parent_table, properties={ 'id': parent_table.c.id, 'children': relationship( Child, foreign_keys=[child_table.c.parent_id], single_parent=True, backref='parent') }) &gt; Hard to break down exactly what I'm building. But let's just say I want to get the last Child for a given Parent id and update its status to completed. Would I want to have get_last_child_and_complete method on the ParentDataAccess class? Or would I want a get_last_child, return a ChildDomain object and then do something with that? The whole point of this style of architecture is that it lets us put the domain front-and-centre of our work, so it's hard to talk about it in the absence of a meaningful domain model. Let's say that we wanted to have a Proposal. A Proposal can have multiple Versions. We can Accept or Reject the latest version of a Proposal, and we can Supersede a version by providing a new one. To start the workflow, we Open a new proposal, providing all the data. class Proposal: def __init__(self, ): self._versions = [] def open(self, proposer, description): self.versions.append( Version(proposer, description) ) def reject(self): self.latestversion.reject() def accept(self): self.latestversion.accept() def supersede(self, proposer, description): v = Version(proposer, description) self._versions.append(v) self.latestversion.superseded_by(v) @property def latestversion(self): return self._versions[-1] @property def state(self): return self.latestversion.state The code for accessing and modifying the latest version of a proposal belongs *in my domain model* because that's the problem I'm trying to solve, and that's what a domain model is for. It's easy to see how we can unit test and refactor this code, because there's no annoying io to get in our way. A use-case exists to provide orchestration. def supersede_proposal(proposal_id, user_id, description): with db.session() as session: proposal = session.get(Proposal, proposal_id) if not proposal: raise KeyError("Couldn't find a proposal with id %s" % proposal_id) proposal.supersede(proposer, description) session.commit() A repository/unit of work pattern exists to abstract that away slightly further, and keep our orchestration distinct from SqlAlchemy specific code. def supersede_proposal(unit_of_work_manager, data): with unit_of_work_manager.start() as uow: proposal = uow.proposals.get(data['proposal_id']) proposal.supersede(data['user_id'], data['description']) uow.commit() 
Thanks. After I read your comment before I had to stare at it a bit more until I realised that a function returning a function could serve the same purpose with less complexity, something like: def range_limited_int_constructor(min_value, max_value): def constructor_with_range_check(value): int_value = int(value) if int_value &lt; min_value or int_value &gt; max_value: raise ValueError(f'{int_value} is outside range [{min_value}, {max_value}]') return int_value return constructor_with_range_check
&gt;Everything should be as simple as possible, but not simpler. I really like this! &gt;Look at the confusing mess that is the latest C++ standard. You mean C++20? From the little that I've seen, it's still very much a work in progress (at least I hope so..)

Hi, I'm the OP. I think it's awesome you did your project, despite what the other commenters say. My question was directed at the subreddit, not you. I was interested in knowing what kind of subreddit this was. 
Sure, but I usually prioritize readability over performance since I work on smallish datasets. My point was rather to point out that the example given was not the most readable one, which came out strange because the module introduced is supposed to improve over pandas on this. There are also many other ways to add efficiency (a few were pointed out in the comments). I think I would use the list comprehension long before .locs.

Well i am pretty sure you can download the code for that if you just google LED Strip, Adrduino and Python.
A little off topic, but could you please share how you can post on Instagram from Chrome? I don't have the menu bar on the bottom even in dev mode.

I found pyqt quite easy to use. Had my custom guis up within a day. 
Yes, converting the year column to a datetime dtype will fix this - you can then format the axis to display the date in YY or YYYY format to hide the false precision.

Oh! So it's sort of like like a richer **switch**?
Lol. I love how you are now backtracking because people called you out. You raised a judgmental person like me. You did this to yourself. Clearly you don’t know what encourage is. 
Gotta make a bot that reports bots for being bots so they can’t follow your bot, def bot_report(): If bot = True Report else: Don’t report 
Backtracking? I'm not backtracking anything. Read the original unedited comment and stop being judgmental. I'm even calling YOU out for being dicks about a legitimate question. I could use the same rhetoric, wanting to learn, about the subreddit. twat.
Sad this is how you treat people. Learn a little humility. 
What the fuck? How *I* treat people? You have the nerve to attack me because you misread my intention as malicious and then you actually attempt to degrade me when I call *you* out on it. Shame on you. 
Thanks for proving my point. I’d stop commenting if I were you. 
Last word kind of guy I see. I'm guessing that works great in relationships for you.
can you by any chance share the svg template? I am trying to do some certificate generation and placing text in images is not fun
What does my my relationship with my wife have anything to do with your shameful behavior? Hey back on topic here... You said, “no offense to you op but...” and began to shit on beginners for posting code to r/python. The you ask why, and when someone said they wanted to see what others are learning and enjoyed seeing new code you said you didn’t. Somewhere else people started calling you out and it’s clear where you stand... yet somehow you claim you’re not discouraging even though your original comment clearly comes off that way and you don’t recognize it. Yeah, damn right you’re gonna get called out for it. Seriously just accept the facts, humble up and either admit it or delete your posts. Or don’t but stop digging a bigger hole. 
I just hope people around you suffer cancer so they don't have to suffer you. Leave a girl alone, will you?
No opinion on the library, but the justifying examples could use some polish. data.loc[b_above_4, 'x'] = data.loc[b_above_4, 'a'] data.loc[a_is_3, 'a'] = 300 could just as easily be: data.loc[b_above_4, 'x'] = data['a'] data['a'].replace(3, 300, inplace=True) On a different topic, I really hate the way the word "with" is aggressively molested in all programming languages. "With a frozen banana, strike the nail into the 4x2." Nobody talks like that.
Thanks this worked!

The easy part of pattern matching is that it is like a richer switch. The bit that confuses me is when Haskell people start talking about assignment being a pattern match. I'm sure they know what they're talking about. I just wish that somebody could translate it from Martian to Earthling :-) 
If you think that comment was encouraging you are a dick.
&gt; ... I think it's awesome that you are trying to learn python and make cool stuff. 
Not only that, I've just looked through the commits and they're still there. OP, regenerate your API keys and look into better ways of using credentials in your programs. I could point out a few, but I think that's worth some research to learn about the pros and cons of each one.
So, what are you struggling with..?
You'll need to reset i to 1, and then just substitute `continue` for `break`. /r/learnpython 
Source code is here: [https://github.com/stepacool/Eye-Tracker](https://github.com/stepacool/Eye-Tracker)
Why the hell do I get downvotes for this? :))
I did reset it, but it only does the function once, cause a dialogue pops up and asks me if I want to refresh the page. So it seems I need to create a function that press that dialogue box and restarts the function? &amp;#x200B; import pyautogui import time PressF5 = pyautogui.press("f5") i = 1 while i &gt; 1: time.sleep(300) PressF5() if i == 60: break i += 1 &amp;#x200B;
Had a bit more of a look into doing this. Works quite nicely for `Field`s, however as `__set_name__` is only called _after_ the fully formed class is created, this same magic can't work with `Sections`s... at least not with a pretty big re-factor, and probably some meta-classes! 
"Subreddit for asking questions and for general advice about your python code."
Nice project. But just to be clear (and since it's in the title) - this is purely eye tracking, *not* gaze estimation. Gaze estimation involves mapping a user's eye movements to a point in 3D space, typically the intersection of a gaze ray with some plane in the scene (the computer screen, for example).
The value of `i` is never reset to 1. Break exits the while loop completely. Google break/continue statements.
Awesome thanks!
Thank you. Well, what you call gaze estimation can be easily implemented with my code, in fact I think I'll do it soon. X and Y can be acquired by using keypoints.pt, all I have to do after that is connect it to the screen resolution and draw something at the according point. Thank you.
A true hero sir!
I think you will find it to be a bit more difficult than that. Your keypoints are in camera coordinates, which have no obvious relation to screen or world coordinates. Without external reference points (extrinsics) there is not enough information in your single-camera 2D image to reconstruct a gaze point in 3D space. Gaze estimation is typically done with a single or (preferably) stereo camera setup and at least one pair of (usually infrared) lights to provide this world reference. There are other approaches, but this is pretty much the established state-of-the-art. I'm not trying to discourage you from implementing this yourself - in fact, if you do succeed in making a usable gaze tracker with this setup I would be very interested in seeing how you did it.
Are you getting an error? You should be. The `press` function [returns None](https://github.com/asweigart/pyautogui/blob/master/pyautogui/__init__.py#L922). You are assigning `PressF5` to the return value, not the function. Additionally, you don't need to be using a `while` loop for this. A `for` loop would be more clear, and a lot less likely to accidentally turn into an infinite loop^(1). You're essentially re-writing the semantics for it anyway. for _ in range(60): time.sleep(300) PressF5() That will loop the desired number of times. Using the `_` variable name is a common convention for variables that are not going to be used, but are syntactically required. I would urge you to not re-assign functions like that, though. But I like to know how to do things, even if they're not good things to do. You could manage what you want by using a `lambda`: press_f5 = lambda: pyautogui.press('f5') [See the docs](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#lambda), or by writing out the full function definition: def press_f5(): return pyautogui.press('f5') Obviously you were trying to be concise, but this would probably be the preferred way to do this, again if it were required. One of the only cases I've run across lambdas being used this way, where it's considered normal, is GUI programming. You'll use a lambda when you want to pass a parameter to a function that's being called as an event handler. I would also think that running this would be simpler as a basic command line script. from pyautogui import press from time import sleep # rest between refreshes, seconds REST_REFRESH = 300 def main(iterations): for _ in range(iterations): sleep(REST_REFRESH) press('f5') if __name__ == '__main__': main(60) You could run this from the command line and then put the window to whichever you want to have focus as the program runs. It will sleep for the 300 second period prior to the first call, which should be more than enough time to set the window focus. &amp;#x200B; 1. Why do I say this? Because there is at least 1 syntactically valid way to stop this loop from terminating. If `i += 1` gets accidentally changed to `i = 1` then the loop will never terminate. I would be super excited if someone could show me a similarly easy mistake that will force a `for` loop to iterate infinitely.

I was thinking of using school geometry course of similar geometric figures(rectangles in my case), where one rectangle is the screen, another rectangle is my eye-frames. The only problem is the size, for example if the screen resolution is 1600x900, and my image is 160x90, I'll have to "split" screen into 10x10 pixel blocks as the fundamental coordinates unit. Then, I'll just connect each of those 160x90 10x10 blocks to 160x90 1x1 blocks eye picture. This is just and example, and the way I intend to implement it. Thank you for the insight knowledge though.
What's more, a simple model that uses the location of the eyeball alone to track Gaze will always underperform. Gaze depends on things like neck position, angle and tilt of your face, horizontal and lateral distance from the camera, position of the camera relative to the screen.
The point of gaze is not the location of the eyes but the point that these eyes are looking at. If you simply map the camera pixels to screen pixels you will get an up- or downscaled image from your camera on your screen. If you move your head around, this "gaze" that you found will move around the screen. But I can keep my head perfectly still and look at any point on the screen. That's the information that you want to capture. But honestly, since you already implemented this eye tracker I have no doubts that you are very capable of just trying out the approach that you outlined above and seeing what happens for yourself. Again, I mean no disrespect - I think this is an impressive project coming from someone still in school. Keep at it and you will become a top notch computer vision scientist ;)
Too slow
Do your homework. Ask for help when you run into a problem. 
I think you are correct! I should have done it that way to beginner with! Great idea!!!
I agree!
Nicely done. Keep improving on it to add to your portfolio!
As you could tell I'm pretty new to the class concept. I was kind of struggling with that part. So are you saying to make a Player class but change the stats of the player to go with if the player chooses to be one of the four player classes and may store the stats in a list or dictionary? So would i set the stats after player has chosen or in the class its self have it like player\_in\_game = Player('name', 'player class') so if the class chosen it can set stats to that class requirement? Sorry for the questions I've only just started coding this year and haven't had a hole lot of practice even at that. Any advice is welcome!!!!!!
oh man, that I don't know how to do. I'll look into it though! I never thought about that but it would be more efficient saving the map that way. Would you have to load the hole map into memory doing it that way? SOOO MANY QUESTIONS! lol I'm about to crash google with questions! 
Thank you! 
Hello Pawel, Thanks for info. I saw it and I am about to read it soon. I have just overviewed content as I had not much time. Have a nice day Pavel
&gt; is it of type main() or it is iterator? It is both. There aren't different `self` here, it's always the same thing. &gt;? One could actually argue that equality is defined as equality of sub-components, in which case, this object isn't the same, because it is modified destructively, but we will ignore this debate for now. &gt; when we give do next(self), what self are we giving to next (iterator or of type(a)) ? There is only one self, and that is the one that you give it. ---- I think, your fundamental confusion here is in what "type" means. You seem to think that an instance may be of only one type, which is not the case. Any instance is of a type and all of its supertypes. And, in case of Python, the story is even more complicated: there are, for example, synthetic types (a.k.a. algebraic types) for example, you can conceive of type `int+str` (read as either `int` or `str`), then `1` is of this type as well as `"foo"` is of this type, but this doesn't mean that they share the same supertypes. With all that said, the *real* type system in Python isn't based on type algebra, it's about what it calls "protocols": to verify if any given instance is of a particular type (answers to a specific protocol), that protocol has a fixed implementation, which can be tested. This is exactly the case with iterators: they are entirely orthogonal to the *fake* type system inspired by functional languages and don't stand in any relationship to the type algebra described above.
Read the [README.md](https://README.md) if you really want to help! more specifically the part on **Find Me Here.**
One more question though, do you use urllib2 or requests?
This worked really well. I've learnt new things that I probably need to read around to learn. I ended up running it in the cmd prompt window. Does the function pause before it starts, and it is possible to print the number of times it's refreshed already?

Does this work with python 3 as well? &amp;#x200B;
OK. Thanks for the clarification.
If you can make OpenCV work on Python 3, it will. Just make sure to install PyQT 5 for python 3 too then, because in my readme the command installs PyQT 5 for python 2.7. My python syntax will work on both python versions.
FYI, this belongs in /r/learnpython.
Understood, Thank you :) 
I understood the title wrong and thought you were extracting memes from Instagram and I was saying that Instagram either has shit memes or has reposts from reddit. Then I realized you were actually reposting to instagram, which is even worse tbh
Yeah I already have Open CV installed from another program. And cool!
Been working on my toy language project, Akilang, using Python and LLVM: [https://github.com/syegulalp/Akilang](https://github.com/syegulalp/Akilang) The whole thing's basically an experiment to see how much of a language, and to what degree of success, I can implement by way of those tools. I'm finding the main limitations aren't Python or LLVM, but my own understanding -- but hey, enhancing my own understanding is also what this is all about. Recently added: * Type boxing and unboxing! We can now wrap variables of any type in a generic "object" container, which can be passed across function boundaries. This allows for code like: ``` def main():u64{ var x=box("Yo there!") match objtype(x) { type(str): print (unbox(x,str,'Sorry, I was looking for a string.')) type(i32): print ("Default!") type(u64): print ("Unsigned long!") default: print ("No idea!") } } ``` If you're on Windows, you can pull and try out Akilang right now, with some demos (e.g., Conway's Game Of Life). I'm also working on a "Robots" game demo, which is now playable.
oh man i knew about inherits of classes but i haven't used it before! WOW THAT IS CLEANER!!! Then i can use the Mage class for special attributes of they player class! WOOWWWWWW SOOOOOO EXCITING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Thanks for the suggestion!!! Very kind of you to help me!
Trying to figure out if I can use "capabilities" to create a safe eval where you can choose what capabilities the script can and can't have. (If anyone has any resources on "capabilities" and how to use the programmatically, do share ;) )
New comment for Intspirit Team!
Nose is a dead package. Pytest or unittest.
Here is my map generation process: [https://github.com/BillmanH/Flask-Game/blob/master/Map%20Data%20-%20Randomly%20Generate%20Map.ipynb](https://github.com/BillmanH/Flask-Game/blob/master/Map%20Data%20-%20Randomly%20Generate%20Map.ipynb) All of the code is there from generation to uploading into S3 for storage. Each time a new character is created, the server creates a unique map for that person. So each profile has a character key and a map key. That's also how you save/load your game in the live app. &amp;#x200B; Here is the actual code in the live app: [https://github.com/BillmanH/Flask-Game-Front-End/tree/master/backend](https://github.com/BillmanH/Flask-Game-Front-End/tree/master/backend) &amp;#x200B; The map generator function places terrain based on what terrain is closest to the cell selected so that there are ranges of similar terrain. In the app experience you can also load the full map view and see the overall map. I also made map-wrapping functions so that if you go to the west you come out in the east again. 
then you should have posted it in r/learnpython

I agree with you. I feel like they let the whole thing get away from them. For example, they went to all this trouble to get coroutines working with `yield from` and then oops, we need a new keyword actually.
If you know the scale of the eye, you can compute the 3d vector coming out the eyeball as its spherical. The scale of the eye can easily be derived with a face detector or something 
Hi Intspirit !!!
ok sweet!! I will look at it once i fix the player classes. I'm working on them now.
Yeah, it was completely backhanded. It's like when someone starts a sentence with "I'm not racist, but.."
Python is a good and powerful start, look for the free book online of Automating the boring stuff with python, was useful AF to me.
Begin at the end: [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com) Taking your post verbatim, what you’re describing is a mammoth undertaking. If you’re trying to build a cool personal project and learn some new tools in the process, then I would suggest starting with Scrapy (which will help you crawl websites) and ElasticSearch (which will help you search through the websites you’ve crawled with Scrapy). The suggestion to use ElasticSearch is of course predicated on the assumption that you’re not trying to build the database and query language necessary to create a full “search engine for the internet”...
You should have an structure like this for player 2: &amp;#x200B; while count &lt; 17: guess() if guess != number: print("Incorrect, guess again") else: print("You win") count = count +1
It is for a specific category. I want to develop it and not use a 3rd party solution. 
Thanks so much for taking the time to help explain this further. I have a couple of follow up questions: * one of the reasons I thought having a separate domain model was to ensure that I couldn't use any SQLAlchemy-specific methods on a returned instance e.g. `instance.save()`. Looking through the code [here](https://github.com/bobthemighty/blog-code-samples/blob/master/ports-and-adapters/07/issues/adapters/orm.py#L31) you're using your domain model in the query and returning an instance. Does that instance have SQLAlchemy behavior baked into it e.g. _could_ you call save on it outside of that module? * with the unit of work pattern, do all of your repositories have to be defined as properties on it [like so](https://github.com/bobthemighty/blog-code-samples/blob/master/ports-and-adapters/07/issues/adapters/orm.py#L78)? * let's say in your example `IssueReported` is separated out and stored in something like Mongo. What changes would you make to your code? Would you have to update the UoW and have both mongo and SQLAlchemy code in there? Then update the `IssueRepository` to just save the `reporter_id` instead?

Input noise matters as much as lighting, so long it doesn't interfere with the basic algorithms, it's fine. For brighter backgrounds move threshold to the right, for darker move it to the left.
I have been working on that yesterday with SQLite3 for storing the player stats what coordinate the play has been and his inventory exe...... Thanks for the confirmation I'm doing it right or at lest chose the right data base to use. I almost used Json file but decided against it do to i already had a good idea how SQL worked. 
Ok, in which case Scrapy is definitely the python library of choice for scraping websites. I would use Scrapy to push data into ElasticSearch, then use the official python library to query the data in ElasticSearch.
Requests should do it
Thank you. I will use del
Thanks. I will follow your recommendation

Getting my feet wet in the world of databases with a Udemy course on PostgreSQL/Python. All the data for the projects I'm doing at work is currently living in a myriad of xlsx, xlsm, csv, txt, and pdf files strewn across multiple folders and it's getting messy. It's time to get it all consolidated into a proper database. I'm ultimately thinking about making a dashboard web app around it with Django, but for starters I just want a single organized place where all my data sits ready to be easily queried.
Thank you
Did you hear that?????? Yeah that was my jaw hitting the floor....... I Have a lot of work to do. Making a random map is soul crushing at the moment! lol more research is needed. lol I love your code! You have given me a lot to think about. Ive been making a mob randomly spawn but you made each area have a mob type for that area correct? &amp;#x200B; the map wrap is an awesome idea!!!! Also How do i play your game?
do you have this program available to download, or is it part of something else you're building?
That's how my third kid learned to swim, don't ask about the first two.
Right now it's not a stand alone program, it's some files that you can launch with console and they'll act as a program. But they need some pre-installed libraries on your PC to work from the console. And yes, those files can be downloaded and the whole process takes around 5 minutes.
Working on a project for a python course I'm taking at my university. I'm creating a PDF Parsing command line tool that parses PDF documents for user specified data and outputs the results to the screen and also to a file so they can refer back to it. The user can search for key words or phrases and they get back the pages that the word or phrase was found on, and the number of times the word appears on each of those pages. I'm going to attempt to implement multiprocessing to speed up the parsing of the documents!
I doubt anyone is going to read over 500 lines of unformatted python code trying to figure out where an error happens and why. Try formatting your code for reddit (or use a github gist) and identify for us what the exact error is (*i.e.* what you are getting versus what you expect) and someone will probably help you out. Also, consider posting this to r/learnpython.
I would also consider taking a look at [Sentdex](https://www.youtube.com/user/sentdex) on youtube. He has video tutorials over python. He has several hundred videos concerning the basics all the way to more advanced topics such as machine learning and building web applications. He has truly been instrumental in helping me learn and grow in the python programming language.
Nice! Now do one for reddit :-)
Man that stinks i got no luck! Cowboy2000 has so much! luck dog!!!
Finishing up my Spotify API and Raspberry Pi project called Colorfy (see https://github.com/davidkrantz/Colorfy) It fetches the album artwork of the current Spotify playback and from that finds a suitable background color that is then set to a LED-strip if it's playing on a Chromecast. 
I doubt the "code does wrog math"... A computer just does what you programed it to do. You certainly missed something out. But you code is unreadable. Sorry.

Some things I'm Trying to put in the game are. 1. Random custom map generation 2. Enter able structures 3. Massive amount of items, weapons, and Mobs/Enemy's 4. Crafting and very small base building. Yes this is just a text based game but it would be pretty neat to have accomplished something like this in my opinion. # Why I'm Doing this Project I decided to make this game because I really feel like I have a good grasp of knowledge when it comes to making a good Terminal app. I am still pretty darn new to Coding in general and that is why I started this project to sharpen my skills with coding and understanding it as a hole. # What I've Learn So Far * I've learned that commenting on your code can not only help other people to read your code but also let your self know what you did next week when you changed up that Function. * Some Things as a hole seem to hard but if you break the hole thing down into small peaces it get to a point where its not so overwhelming. * I Love To Code. JK JK I knew that already! &amp;#x200B; # The Struggle * I solve one part of the game and my brain thinks of some really cool stuff to add in the game and i add about 5 more problems. * My Razor mouse keeps disconnecting and ITS DRIVING ME NUTS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! * I would like to have a job one day programming but man this small game is proving to be a massive challenge.

&gt; Does that instance have SQLAlchemy behavior baked into it e.g. could you call save on it outside of that module? No, it's not an [Active Record pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_record_pattern#Implementations). There's no save method. SqlAlchemy _does_ proxy your object in order to do change detection, but this is invisible to the end-user except in certain circumstances. &gt; with the unit of work pattern, do all of your repositories have to be defined as properties on it? No, not at all. At $PREVIOUS_JOB we used to wire them up in a completely different way using an IOC container. Fundamentally, though, you want the repository to have access to the session object, and obtaining them from the unit-of-work makes the wiring easy to manage. &gt; let's say in your example IssueReported is separated out and stored in something like Mongo... Yes, at that point I'd create a new repository that, for example, serialised the Issuer to a json blob and stored it in a Mongo table. People get hung up on this point, though, I don't _usually_ want to change database technology halfway through a project. A better example is "what happens if I need to change the structure of the database for performance reasons?". In this model I can change the mappings _without_ needing to change the structure of my domain model because the two are - to some degree - orthogonal. &gt; Another thing is we can't always use SQLAlchemy's mappings. If we split out IssueReporter into mongo, where does the logic live to turn the mongo object into a domain model? Same if we instead switch to using Django's ORM for everything. The Django ORM or the Mongo ORM are *adapters*. They plug the outside world into a *port*, in this case a repository and unit of work interface. It's the job of the adapter to know how to convert between an Issue, or a Proposal, into INSERT statements, or json blobs, or protobuf bytes.
Great idea, I'll add the option for using \`venue='reddit'\` to the package
DUDE AWESOME WORK!!!!!!!!!!
Sentdex is AWESOME BUTTTTT I started really learning python or even how to code from The zero to hero python bootcamp course. IT IS WORTH THE MONEY! You wont regret it i can promise you that! Look for me in the discord room if you get the course.
Is there anywhere that gives a tutorial on how to build these for Android?
This sounds suspiciously like homework 
Here's my source so far. Have fun. I dont need data entry anymore, but if you want to play with it, here you go! https://pastebin.com/9HbUqttS
I do it all the time - I write a LOT of scripts at work to move data around and it makes it super easy to copy/paste a chunk of code .. with the import if it does something unusual .. I run all my stuff through black and flake8 .. &amp;#x200B; Not a great example but i was playing with limits for recursion, memoizing, etc the other day - you can see where I added sys and functools. #!/usr/bin/env python3 import argparse import sys sys.setrecursionlimit(200000) parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description="Process some integers.") parser.add_argument("fibof", type=int, help="What Number did you want to fib?") args = parser.parse_args() fibof = args.fibof # @memoized import functools @functools.lru_cache(maxsize=20001) def fib(n): if n &lt;= 1: return 1 return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2) print(f"fib({fibof})={fib(fibof)}") &amp;#x200B;

Awesome man thanks!!!!
What about this scenario. And please excuse my lack of knowledge of Reddit markup. Func (a=10, b=none), where I want a to maintain it's default value but also give b a value. I need some reference to the name of the parameter right?

Ohhhhh I totally misread your comment, 7am, coffeeless, cheers!
Indeed it would. You'll need to know a bit about SNMP, and have access to a "MIB" for your printers. &amp;#x200B; Here's a guy who did it for HP . [https://github.com/Kegeruneku/hp-snmp-levels](https://github.com/Kegeruneku/hp-snmp-levels) &amp;#x200B;
&gt; Automated memory allocation / de-allocation (for variables, arrays, hash tables etc.) Absolutely. Python does memory management for you, unlike C. &gt; Turning your program into an executable (that is, pre-compiled.) There are third-party tools to do that (like Cython). &gt; Automated variable initialization (variables, arrays don't even need to be declared, much less initialized) Yes, that’s the very essence of Python. &gt; Automated type casting (e.g. automatically treating a same variable as an integer or string depending on the context: integer when performing a multiplication, or string for concatenation) Python is dynamically typed, so, by definition, it does have “automated type casting” (more commonly known as duck typing).
Very nice
Today I started a 9 month course on data analytics which involves a lot of python so will be frequenting this sun often 😁

Nice french rap someone posted =)
Thanks. I added a 2 second delay and now it continues until 980..but then it stops. Any chance you know why?
I had a similar thing happen to me when trying to parse comments. Maybe an API issue? It worked for a while but stopped at around 10000 comments
This super cool and well done.
I do this so often that I wrote a module for myself using openpyxl. The file is called get\_dict\_list\_from\_excel.py (catchy right?) and whenever I need to use it I just copy that file into my project folder and then import it in my main app file. Here's the code if you're interested... """ Returns a list of dictionaries from an Excel worksheet where keys are the worksheet headers. If no sheet name is specified, the first sheet in the workbook will be used. If no start row is specified, it will start on Row 2. """ from openpyxl import load_workbook def main(fpath, sheetname=None, start_row=2): if fpath.lower().endswith('.xlsm'): wb = load_workbook(fpath, keep_vba=True) else: wb = load_workbook(fpath) ws = wb[sheetname] if sheetname else wb.active ret_list = [] for row in ws.iter_rows(min_row=start_row): row_dict = {} for i, cell in enumerate(row): row_dict[ws.cell(1, i + 1).value] = cell.value ret_list.append(row_dict) return ret_list &amp;#x200B;
That's awesome!

If he's using praw then the delay is actually built into the library. Asking why code doesn't work without posting the code isn't likely to get the OP any helpful responses.
Try this, assuming year series is a string. df = df[ ~df.year.str.startswith('2012') ~df.year.str.startswith('2013') ]
***Just released 0.10.0 to PyPI.*** Here's a summary of the changes: * Support for both PySide2 and PyQt5 * Size translation from tkinter to Qt sizes * Autoclose windows * Auto button size fix * Progress bar starting value * Better popup layout The biggest of these if ability to use PyQt5 package instead of PySide2. If you have PyQt5 installed, then PySimpleGUIQt will use that. Otherwise it'll use PySide2. Sorry I didn't get the option to choose in this release. If you want to force it, you can edit the PySimpleGUIQt.py file. Size translation code converts from the character based size specs in tkinter into pixel dimensions. The result is that to run your existing PySimpleGUI code, you simply change the import at the time from PySimpleGUI to PySimpleGUIQt. Poof... instantly your running Qt. Another notable feature is the autoclosing window. These are popups that will close themselves after a while if no one clicks a button. You can also specify these as "non-blocking" windows. The result is a message that pops up, remains there for a short while, then closes. But by making it non-blocking your program will not wait around for it to close. There's a PopupQuickMessage call that shows a borderless window that will close after a period of time. Great for doing "Load..." messages. It looks something like [this](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13696193/48443229-67d8be80-e75e-11e8-90e0-a35c919516d4.gif). Here's the code..... sg.PopupQuickMessage('Loading...', auto_close_duration=4, keep_on_top=True, location=(800,800)) sg.Popup('This is a normal blocking popup','It was called after the PopupQuickMessage call.', location=(1000,800)) &amp;#x200B; Finally, beginning to research the next target graphics framework to port to. I recently had a request for WxPython which I had not considered for a while. That's a possibility for sure since it's well documented like Qt. Kivy is also on the list, but think it's going to be a more difficult port due to docs and less sample code to draw from. 
That's cool. How did you handle transition of songs/ album covers? Smooth or just abrupt change?
Thatsreally cool:) 
I will update you with my general code when I am done. I am actually writing 14 different functions because they differ in there json syntax a little bit. 
It doesn't matter what limit you set, PRAW has a hard limit of 1000. If you want older Reddit sets try looking under /r/datasets or some of the Google cloud or other providers where people have set up archives. 
It takes a text file from a converted word document , adds html tag elements, and also adds the other page tags/content. The newly formatted article is ready to be posted on the web!
Totes magotes, dawg: def main(iterations): for i in range(iterations): print(f'I\'ve refreshed for your lazy butt {i} times', end='\r') sleep(REST_REFRESH) press('f5') Two things, f-strings rock, and did you know you can tell the print function what line ending to use? You can. The `\r` is a carriage return. Basically the line will output on the same line regardless of how many times it prints. Keeps your stdout from looking like a mess 1 looking like a mess 2 looking like a mess 3 looking like a mess 4 looking like a mess 5 looking like a mess 6 looking like a mess 7 looking like a mess 8 looking like a mess 9 looking like a mess 10 looking like a mess 11 The f-string won't work unless you're running 3.5+ I think. Otherwise just use `str.format`. As far as pausing before it starts: the sleep function is called in the first iteration, *before* the press function is called. So it does sleep before the first refresh. It's not quite accurate to say that it sleeps before it starts though, since the sleep is inside the loop (necessarily). Forgive the sass, it was a long day of not being sassy at work.

After having to manually manage DNS entries and DHCP reservations in Active Directory once too many times I built a home-made IPAM solution with flask appbuilder (https://github.com/dpgaspar/Flask-AppBuilder) which calls a bunch of PowerShell scripts to gather data and edit dns entries and dhcp reservations. I am hoping it will become our company’s official “PowerShell script launcher” since it has a nice security model and tasks can be easily delegated.

Sentdex is good if you already have a basic programming language understanding IMO. I tried to learn from him as someone who had never seen code before (about a year ago), and 3/4ths of what he taught went right over my head. After a good basic knowledge in Python, he was a great way to refresh / pick up the more advanced stuff.
A month ago, while in hospital I was 'dreaming' about what game I would play when I'll come back. And it was FTL. But when I actually came back, it wasn't as satisfying as I thought, so I decided to begin the great project I had in mind since years ... So, I'm working on a pygame project, a XCOM-like but in real-time and with other features. Right now, I'm really struggling with the movement algorithm ! My A* implementation works good enough, but for moving the character according to his own velocity ... I don't know, I think I'm not smart enough ! Also, managing a "big project" when it's not your main domain is really hard !
I am making a CLI to the Pihole sqlite3 database to run more complicated queries. The default interface searches only by a date range, then you can filter. The web-browser version seems to only sort by date and crashes frequently upon a large search query. &amp;#x200B; I am interested in all dns queries from a particular client, or all clients that have attempted to resolve a certain domain. Additionally, it provides summary results of the number of queries, unique queries, and client unique queries (ignoring timestamps). Finally, it adds a dictionary lookup to change the ip address of the client to a description ("alkelaun1's computer" or "alkelaun1's phone" &amp;#x200B; The script works but, humorously, I now need to add date filter to my query. &amp;#x200B; I've done some Django stuff before, but this is really my first python script. So far I've learned about sets, databases, and dictionaries. Going forward, besides implementing time-based search I am also looking to create either a Django app or Flask app to present the data in a web browser. &amp;#x200B;

An else statement can't have a condition. You probably wanted to use elif instead
thanks, I'll move the post over to r/learnpython but basically, all the code excluding the imports the 'data' is a pandas data frame and all I'm trying to do is print out the date ID only. I've been able to call the labels with print(data\[\['USD (AM)', 'USD (PM)'\]\]) but I'm only looking to pull out the id that's associated with 'date'.

Read Python's documentation worked better than any other things for me
I am a total noob. Making a code for multiplikation. Gonna add some 'hello, enter the numbers you want to multiply', 'error, that is not a number' etc.
Thank you!
Thanks!
Very cool! Keep it up!
I started 'Automate the Boring Stuff with Python' about a month ago. &amp;#x200B; After I got about half way through the book I was so excited I decided to start automating a task for a friend. &amp;#x200B; Now i'm in way over my head and there is no looking back. Starting a project has forced me to really learn a lot. 
Reminds me of Aseprite. Keep up the good work!

This is really fucking cool! I just started messing around with the PyGame library. I made my own brick breaker game today. It's not much but I'm proud! 
I literally know nothing about programming at all, I've been watching [this guy](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rfscVS0vtbw) for a couple days hoping to learn something so I can properly use my RTL-SDT to hack the darn video guys' little dsan clicker for advancing PowerPoint slides while I'm at work since work is really boring sometimes
Try a different version of geckodriver maybe. I just keep trying them until one works.
I've generally found selenium to extremely finicky and the experience of using it was generally hot garbage. If you're just using it to render web pages at a specific URL and don't need to navigate around them (besides pagination), you could try https://html.python-requests.org/

You can add pycache folder to gitignore. No need to keep those files in repository.
It's worthy if it close to your heart. You will get there. Just start reading more on math and algs. Smartness is directly propirtional to the efforts.
It looks like older (2.x) versions of the ['django-registration' package](https://pypi.org/project/django-registration/) (which you'd get with `pip install 'django-registration==2.*'`) installed a python code module named 'registration'. Your code probably wants that. You'll want to `pip uninstall registration`, so as not to have conflicting module names. Having the module name different from the package name is not a best practice (because it can be confusing for users trying to install the right package, among other reasons). So the current version (3.0) of the django-registration package now installs a module named 'django_registration' instead (among other backwards-incompatible changes). If you tried `pip install django-registration` without the version, this is why it didn't work for you. I was looking at the latest version when I suggested your INSTALLED_APPS was wrong. It's not wrong, it's just old. If you plan to make your website live, one of the first steps should be to make a requirements.txt file that lists every external dependency (and the version!) so that you can recreate the environment reliably in the future. Then identify dependencies that are outdated or unsupported (like django-registration 2.x) and update your code to work with supported versions.

I too have written some Python code that mainly generates bugs.
That's okay, it's useful for me to see which concepts make sense to people and which things people struggle with. This is my day job, so I think of it as training ;) class Version: """ The version object is responsible for maintaining its own invariants, for example we might have a rule that once a version is somehow completed, you may not change its state. """ def reject(self, reason: str): if self.state != VersionState.Proposed: raise ValueError("The version is already in state %s" % self.state) self.state = VersionState.rejected self.message = reason def open_proposal(user_id, description): """ SqlAlchemy uses change tracking. The only time we need to explicitly add something to a session is if we are creating a new object. It can manage the relationships for us, you don't necessarily need related_thing to be an id. Proposer, for example, could be a User object. There's a whole other issue here about appropriate consistency boundaries, but we can leave that for another day. """ with unitofwork.start() as uow: # Proposer is now a user object proposer = uow.users.get(user_id) proposal = Proposal.open(proposer, description) # our proposer can now have its own complex state assert proposal.proposer.first_name == "fred" # Here's where we insert the proposal into our repository. In tests that would # just append it to a list, but in production that would involve calling session.add # on the SqlAlchemy session. uow.proposals.add(proposal) uow.commit() def supersede_proposal(proposal_id, description): """ If we load an object through the session then when we flush changes to the session, SQLAlchemy will automatically update our objects. This includes creating new children. In this use-case, the supersede method will create a new version internally, but that will be automatically inserted by SqlAlchemy due to the relationship mapping from Proposal. """ with unitofwork.start() as uow: # When we load the proposal, we get the entire object graph, including the # proposer and all the versions.

In this model the Proposal and the Version change together, so we can see them as part of a single unit. The User has its own lifetime, so maybe we *should* just treat proposer as an id and load it separately because we shouldn't ever change it in the same transaction. This is a a fancy technique called [aggregate modelling](http://dddcommunity.org/library/vernon_2011/).

Wow! That looks awesome, great job!
what is that extension "pyde"?
Fair point! What IDE are you using ? I am not huge on IDEs - I was using vim, but now I've started using VS Code and it works perfectly when developing with Nameko!

"*Take every effort into including members from under-represented group into consideration."* The grouping started with the overt and obvious (male/female, race, skin colour), then moved to intangible (sexual orientation, feelings of gender belonging). Why stop there? The nonsense of this should be obvious to everyone. The division can continues based on various personal attributes (overt and intangible) until each group contains exactly one person. &amp;#x200B; "Personally I’m convinced that diversity is the key of new ways of thinking and doing" It seems you're just singing the song of political correctness without thinking.
I just want to compliment you on thinking of a pun and actually making it real. That is some commendable commitment to puns.
I understood this playfully cynical critique of Python.

You might find Binder ([https://mybinder.org/](https://mybinder.org/)) useful. It automates turning a Github repository with notebooks into a docker container that can be accessed in a browser.
I've written a handful of little helper programs and this week I've learned how to use getopt to pass arguments to them.
"The grouping started with the overt and obvious (male/female, race, skin colour)" I'm a white, male Brazilian. This diversity does not apply to me. But it still doesn't male sense that we have less than 20% non white attendees in Python Brazil conferences. Seriously, this is Brasil. There's a initiative called AfroPython but it's very recent. And we still have to hear in conferences that "You are the first woman in year of conference to give a good technical lecture." And this is talking about a "minority" that is nearing 40% of attendance and 50% of lectures. Things are not solved. If you still think that diversity efforts are worthless, it's probably the privilege talking.
It looks quite interesting. 
I use generators to write code that's too buggy to generate any bugs
I'm a polyglot. It seems I'm good at generating bugs in any language. &amp;#x200B;

This is so cool! Congrats!
Pycharm. It works fine when working with nameko, just pycharm can’t determine the functions in the dependency when injecting it. Which is the only thing I don’t like about it

Most likely yes. Check out ActionChains and frame-switching/alert-checking for Selenium. The user-interface is also basically a webpage and should be automatable.
Hi Intspirit!
Right you are! Good engineer can write buggy code despite the language.
Open in IDLE. From there, open the Python file. Press F5 to start. You’ll see the error in red. Paste into google. 
I can't see an error in the file I tried to open. [https://imgur.com/gallery/m8rh5bP](https://imgur.com/gallery/m8rh5bP)
But it does print out the number..? What else did you expect?
There doesn't seem to be an error. If you don't want the window to be closed immediately, you should put `input()` at the end of the script.
It's like this: it works on IDLE. But when I try to open it on the main program of Python 3. 6. 5, it shows up black and blank for a second then disappears in a flash.
Did you actually call your main function, or just define it? 
I don’t know an awful lot about Python on windows but I *think* this is what it is supposed to do? When you open it via executing the file directly it opens it in a command line, executes it and when the program has terminated, closes the command line again. What happens when you’re opening a command line and execute your file from there? Then it shouldn’t close after executing.
Is there a way to make the IDLE executions appear on the 3. 6. 5?
I just clicked my file.

Much appreciated! Now I just have to clean up my code...
Thank you thank you. Still haven't thought of a clever name for the series though. "Computer Bugs", "Code Bugs", "Bugs In My Code"... Any ideas?
well you could start scraping, following links and scraping those recursively, but you will need to implement a depth limit, or else you'll literally end up scraping the whole internet. 
Is this new? I didn’t know you could code for Processing in Python! That’s cool! 
So, giving the script starting url, and telling it to navigate to any &lt;a&gt; tags it finds, scrape the pages they point to, then navigate to any &lt;a&gt; tags found in these new pages, and scrape the pages THEY point to, and so on? What do you think would likely happen if I didn't specify a depth limit?
The government is slowly being overrun by large buglike creatures and this program is designed to model them in a 2d plane in order to make it easier for humans to identify them. Please share this as I don’t believe I’ll be alive for much longer.

Tried out `arcade` just to see what it was like. I tried replicating an old game I made with GameMaker when I was younger, or at least the basic mechanics of it (a fairly fluid and agile top-down shooter based off Starfox). It turns out that what seemed complex to young me is something I could get rigged up and working in about an hour with Python.

Extra credit if it outputs a giant string of numbers as well as the 'lengths' of the numbers, the latter theoretically being given to someone physically.
I had an idea to create a set list of primes that the program would ranfomly pull from, but i would prefer the numbers be infinite (within reason)

&gt; There's a whole other issue &gt; here about appropriate consistency boundaries, but we can leave that for another day I think that's an important thing to bring up. Let's go back to the Parent/Child instance. A is a parent of B which a parent of C etc. If you do something in your use case like `uow.children.get(&lt;id of c&gt;)` you will return a `Child` instance. You can then do `c.parent.parent`. I'm not sure how SQLAlchemy works and if each each to `.parent` is a separate API call (I'd imagine at least one of them results in a separate call), but this seems to break some boundaries. If some sort of technology were swapped out I _think_ you would have to update the new repository to traverse all parents back to ensure that uses of `c.parent.parent....` in the use cases still work. Does that make sense?
2to3 can output a diff without modifying the code.
Why python 2.7 and not python 3+?
Why not? 
&gt; A is a parent of B which a parent of C etc. &gt; uow.children.get(&lt;id of c&gt;) This is why it's important to talk in terms of a real domain model. What you're describing here is *not* a thing I would do, at least not lightly. In the example we've been discussing, we have a parent/child relationship in the shape of Proposal and Version, but the hierarchy is strictly limited to a single level. I never *need* to call uow.versions, because I would *always* access the versions via the Proposal. The Proposal is the consistency boundary: two people should not be able to simultaneously create a new version of the same proposal. Likewise I never need to call proposal.versions.versions, nor proposal.version.proposal.versions - those aren't operations that have meaning in the model. If I had a genuine need to support an unbounded hierarchy, I'd have to think seriously about my access patterns to choose an appropriate query strategy. I have worked on systems with that requirement and, actually, it was mostly okay because the transactions of the system (files/folders) were usually only operating at a single level of hierarchy at a time. Querying was significantly harder, but if I were doing that again today I'd probably build out a separate read model to make it easier. Think carefully about whether you *do* need that, though.
It is on [GitHub](https://github.com/kamik423/cutie) and [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/cutie). You can install it with `pip3 install cutie`. The source code for the example and documentation is at both those locations.

Built into Jupyter Notebook is the ability to simply save the notebook t0 html. That, in turn, posts straight up as a web page. Here is an example of a page that was created that way: https://www.palmislandtraders.com/econ136/delta_hedge.html but be advised that the created file is an inelegant, massive jumble of html. Take a look at the view-source of the file above to see what I mean. BUT it does work and it works well.
Thanks, I'm making progress in my understanding. 
Very Cool! Have you thought about using the Unicode checkmark, ✓ that many people have included in their software. It would look extra cool that way!
Regex is like a goldfish. For regex, the world is a set of states and a set of transitions between those states. There isn't any place where it stores memory about previous states. The goldfish only ever knows where it is right now and where it can go from there, never where it was before. This means regex can't do things like 'match all the occurrences of x where it has the same number of *y*s on its left and right', because this would require keeping count of the number of *y*s somehow. Nope, the goldfish only knows 'I am at a state where I see an *x* and I can proceed to a next state when I see a *y*', nothing else. Given the recursive nature of HTML, regex simple can't parse HTML.
yessss this is exactly what ive been looking for!

Exactly happende to me, i have been attracted ( to be honest in love) to automation, and i made a script wich helps you fill long google forms fast AF with real data provided by you. This reduced a lot of time for my and my partners in a project is this why i love that book, and when i need it i always have it in my phone if i have a basic doubt.
That makes sense. In your example you would do `uow.proposals.get(&lt;proposal_id&gt;)` which would return a Propsal with all of the versions. That works fine because there's only a single level. Unfortunately one of my models will have an unknown parent/child relationship because of a self-reference (e.g. model `Thing` has a parent_thing attribute which can be null or a `Thing`, so on and so forth).
I write bugs.
Love this explanation, thank you guys for not absolutely destroying my question :)!

Hi there, I did something similar a couple of years back. I was parsing large XML files (several GBs) and throwing data into ES. I used lxml for this (specifically lxml.etree.iterparse). It is written in Cython so its incredibly fast and iterparse makes it so that the file is processed iteratively (doesn't build up the DOM in-mem). For ES, I used the bulk method as well. But instead of a fixed count per chunk, I broke it up into chunks of ~5MB each. Performed admirably.
Very very thank you. I was looking for something like this for my todo cli app
I think i would need the pdf to make sure it works but, &amp;#x200B; The main problem in your script is that the extract\_text function is printing and not returning a string. &amp;#x200B; If you don't return anything in a function it will return none.
Thanks! It was the Comptia security+ and I got it after 4 months of studying. 
Beautiful readme, beautiful example. I'll hope I'll be able to find it when I'll be looking for something like this :)
Thank you for your kind words! You could always add it to your browsers reading list or a notes file. You could even star or watch it on GitHub (shameless self promotion 😉).
Star it is, I never remember to use those features :)

Python for Data Analysis is the best for data analysis. Wes McKinney, the father of Pandas, wrote that. And Web Scraping with Python by Ryan Mitchell is a very useful book that covers Scrapy and BeautifulSoup really well. You will certainly get a lot out of both of those. 
Great, thank you!
&gt;def extract\_text(pdf\_path): &gt; &gt;all\_text = "" for page in extract\_text\_by\_page(pdf\_path): all\_text += page &gt; &gt;return all\_text &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;The above is a simple way to do it, but below is the pythonic way to do it: &gt; &gt;def extract\_text(pdf\_path): &gt; &gt;return "".join(\[page for page in extract\_text\_by\_page(pdf\_path)\]) &amp;#x200B;
OP, thanks for this. These are amazing. &amp;#x200B; I've been wanting to do this for birds and fish for a long time. I got some drinking glasses a while back like this: [https://www.amazon.com/Charley-Harper-Birds-Glasses-Box/dp/B00DSRDQM6/](https://www.amazon.com/Charley-Harper-Birds-Glasses-Box/dp/B00DSRDQM6/) and was thinking it would be great to make a generator for the images. Hopefully this will get me off my ass. &amp;#x200B; If you threw in a shading library and tweaked the antennae algorithm they would be professional grade .
How does one start to learn python?
MY HERO!!!!! 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻 Will fully test tomorrow but looks promissing!! Thanks!!!
If you’re data is a json array, you don’t need to do the insert_one lines. Just pass it to insert_many, which will work. 
Thank you for the advice...Ill make the updates..any idea how I can get past the error I a receiving? 
Newbie here, why would one use this?
Yes!
I don't see any source code in the comments...
Still receive the error with the follow updates... def main(): if importType == "Insert": collection.insert_many(parsed) if importType == "Replace": db.drop_collection(collectionName) collection.insert_many(parsed) main()
Yeah the antennae are shameful, if I had more time I would work on that. I don't know much about shading, but I tried for several hours to get some internal shadow to give a 3D effect but had to pass on it. Know how to do that?
Thanks! &amp;#x200B;

I think “Fluent Python” by Luciano Ramalho is pretty good. Can’t say for sure cuz I’ve only read some 70% by now, but I like it so far. 
Oh good. Another flavor of Dunning-Krugerrands to scam people who are smart at code and ignorant of economics. 
I'm moving this to a PM, since it's pretty specific now.
are you making a game with these pixels? &amp;#x200B;
I do not. But I remember seeing several libraries that did that a while back. But they were for a particular drawing package. I'll DM you if I get something worthwhile on the birds. My idea was actually a step further. I had this idea of a fish or bird generator that would produce something along the quality of an drawn image you would see in a "Field Guide of New England Fish" book. It would also generate the latin and english names for the animal. And the whole thing would be put in a coffee table book of a few hundred animals per book. But each book you get would have a completely different set of animals making each of them unique.
This is a really interesting way to think about regex's limitations. I was working on a template engine (based on the Bottle Simple Template) and I had some really, really nasty regex statements. They were a combination of my (intermediate) knowledge with some Stack Overflow magic. But they were fragile! I finally realized that I could write a function in python to handle this particular task much more easily, have it be more robust, easier to debug, and extendable. I haven’t rigorously tested it but I suspect the performance is worse but still trivial for my uses (if it take an extra 100 milliseconds, I don't care). My big takeaway is that regex is a useful and valuable skill. But, outside of a fun challenge, it is really not the tool for every job.

Infinity
`float("inf")` you mean?
I have a question. If you hand me one of these, are you prepared for me to hand you back [one of these](https://github.com/ubernostrum/interviewer-hell)?
That’s awesome. I’ve just been assigned to make a practice test for my computer science class to prepare us for the Microsoft python exam and I think I’ll be using this. 
I’m not making a game with the pixel art in the promotional work for Px Editor, but all of my work is in pixel art. https://cmlsc.itch.io
I’m currently making an app for Mac with py2app and python, would it be best practice to obfuscate my code before releasing it? 
Are you running from an editor?
&gt; it keeps only looking for programs in python 2.7 That means you are using python2.7. What OS are you on. Remember that in Linux and Mac you need to use the command "python3" to launch python3. How are you running this (via an IDE? terminal?).
Yes, you can have a pony. (Was this your question?) Thanks anyways for the link - looks like an awesome resource!

Effective Python is good. It focuses on how to write better Python. It's a short book with easy to digest chapters.
GUIs are abysmally slow. Programming/adding scripting to GUIs is a way to reduce tedious tasks. Imagine you're in 3d modeler and you want to make an animation over time with 1000 time steps. The GUI doesn't have animation capability, so you make a for loop to loop over your time steps, update the model to that time step, and take a picture. Then externally, you make a gif. Scripting capability means you can type commands in your gui to call gui commands. I literally just exec python code. It's a massive security hole, and at that point, you might as well give them the help on the functions as well.
Please do read the side bar. Especially these: &gt; If you are about to ask a "how do I do this in python" question, please try r/learnpython or the Python discord. And: &gt; Add 4 extra spaces before each line of code
Try Age=input("type in your age") If age&gt;=18: print ("you can watch...") Else: print ("you cant watch...") 
Sorry, writing from my phone, I missed that detail, my phone always writes the first letter in uppercase.
UH, thats awesome &lt;3
Age = int(input(‘Type in your age’)) If age =&gt; 18: Print(‘statement’) Else: Print(‘statement’) Not sure what your next input is for and you need to format the first input as an int. This will also depend on your version of python. I’m assuming you’re on 3.X
Awesome! I was trying to do something like this for a school project a while back but ended up just doing the classic number selection (no time to make a GUI). I doubt if I'll ever need to make a terminal based menu again, but if I do I will definitely put this to use!
Hey, just a question, OP's command `os.system("timeout -t 5 &gt; NUL")` , shouldn't it be "NULL" instead of "NUL"? Curious, since I haven't seen "NUL" with one "L" before..
It'll depend on the employer and local labour laws, like any other job. Locally, I get the minimum required number of breaks, lunch break, etc for a full time job. You likely won't get more than that but you should be taking eye breaks, breaks to stretch, etc. You likely wouldn't be able to take a ten minute break each hour though, for example
Email an entomologist. They would love this!
First let me let you know that I give technical support, I'm not a developer (I was a freelancer developer a few years ago). Knowing the developers in my company and others companies that I worked for I can tell you that it is not a real 8 hours job. They are not coding all the time. They take several breaks, breaks to order their thoughts, or just breaks to distract their minds a little bit of the challenges they need to solve. &amp;#x200B; I think that there are no jobs that are true 8 hours. I mean, if you work for 8 hours you will probably take longer breaks that if you work for 6 hours. In fact I believe that in terms of productivity you work the same no matter if you do 8 or 6 hours. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
It's pretty rare to spend 8 hours coding. You have meetings, documentation, research, putting together your notes, reviewing other's code, packaging your changes for code review, running the test suite, checking results, and so on. If you can spend half your time actually coding, you're doing pretty well. &amp;#x200B;
I would suggest this more as a reference after you learn most of the language. It is not particularly helpful for people new to the language.
I love this! Fantastic job, OP!

Really cool project, nice references, Monty Python. 10/10 would clone again.
mental breaks here and there and lots of late nights once you get going.
I really love the readme. Clear, concise and totally understandable. The gif sells it great. Also a fellow Frankonian. Even if in 'Unterfranken'. Myself got lost near Hamburg. Came originally from 'Oberfranken'. 
just found snips. Had previously used chatterbot. Both have great potential, snips seems to have a larger following/userbase.
Debugging with print statements is generally the "wrong way" to do things. There are MANY debuggers. This could be good for certain types of logging I suppose.
I would post it to stack overflow but i don't want to have something so trivial on there. Hopefully reddit is more forgiving. 
This is a neat little project! I’ll just have some suggestions for you to make it even better: - Add some unit tests. For small scale testing, [unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html) from the stdlib is easy enough to understand and implement. Even if it’s just a small project, you’ll thank yourself in the future if you add tests now. Trust me ;) - Add `__pycache__` and `.pyc` files to your `.gitignore` - If all your code is in `__init__.py`, you don’t need a package and it makes for a more simpler structure. (There are many great and way bigger projects that consist of a single py file, for example [bottle](https://github.com/bottlepy/bottle?files=1) Keep up the great work! :)
Not in the slightest. I'm well known in my group for being super speedy and I code maybe 3-4 hours total on a good day. Some of my coworkers seem to spend more like 30-60 minutes, tops.
Is there a code snippet for the checkbox on GitHub or anywhere else?
&gt; I thought the classifiers=['Programming Language :: Python :: 3',...] was enough Well, but it is not understood by pip. And python_require is relatively recent (pep is old, but it was only implemented by me about 2 years ago). Side note, instead of using `setup.py` that can be complicated and tricky. Did you had a look at [flit](https://flit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) ?
This might help. I hope. https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-write-the-output-of-a-function-to-a-text-file-in-python
Pretty cool. But wow... if I were you I'd make it easier on myself to do the cursor movement and colors. The most straight-forward could be just CURSOR_UP = '\033[1A' CLEAR_TO_END = '\033[K' val = 0 while val != 5: val = int(input('example input: ')) print(f'You entered {val} but you must input 5 now back to the previous line{CURSOR_UP}\r{CLEAR_TO_END}', end='') print(f'Finally you input {val}') &amp;#x200B;
I think the world is slowly moving to Unicode. Even windows functions that do ascii just convert to wide and call the regular function. But as a putty user I feel the struggle of your decision.

Hello! I'm a bot! It looks to me like your post might be better suited for r/learnpython, a sub geared towards questions and learning more about python. That said, I am a bot and it is hard to tell. I highly recommend posting your question there. Please follow the subs rules and guidelines when you do post there, it'll help you get better answers faster. Show /r/learnpython the code you have tried and describe where you are stuck. **[Be sure to format your code for reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/faq#wiki_how_do_i_format_code.3F)** and include which version of python and what OS you are using. *** ^(this bot is written and managed by /u/IAmKindOfCreative) ^(This bot is currently under development and experiencing changes to improve its usefulness)
I was thinking about this, and I think maybe just make multiple cutie.select()s with only one option? haven't tried it yet
Maybe if you could provide an options dict with the characters you want to use? Something like {“checkbox”: “👍”}
So basically, all bugs are unique? That's so cool. Now, simulate an environment for them and see which one is the fittest. Would be cool thing to see Python, processing and genetic algorithm.
Just a thought, turning off HVAC may not be the best money saver. It takes more energy to cool/heat the ambient air and thus cool/heat the walls that radiate heat from absorbing said heat than it would to maintain the environment. You would probably be better automating closing blinds where the sunlight shines in while adjusting the temperature slightly up/down (AC/Heat) while away. I'd say not more than 9 Deg. 
The script d/l the audio file and stores it. I listen when I want, not when/before the audio is rotated off the site.

No, they wan't you to be sure it's not a repost which it probably is. The chance of finding what i need is slim though given time constraint. Also there's only 1.5 million subreddits, so cheers saying go to another one.
You should remove the pyc file from the repo.
1) You are wrong, check the rules in the sidebar. This DOES INDEED belong in learnpython or stackoverflow 2) If you are going to learn to program you need to learn to use google, plain and simple. Check out the following link and take a look at the very first result. http://lmgtfy.com/?q=python+subprocess.call+write+output+to+file
1) good, I literally came looking for help. 2) knowing how to phrase a subject you a familiar with is key to getting good results, something a new person to topic wouldn't know. Your query is obviously not 101. I appreciate the answer typical Reddit bs aside.
1) You misunderstand, this isn't the place to come for help. I repeat, do not come here to ask for help with Python. Go to /r/learnpython or stackoverflow or whatever. This is a subreddit for discussing python, not asking for help with homework. I only posted that reply after reporting your link for breaking /r/python rules. 2) All I did was copy and paste the method call you were using and your question. This is truly 101 googling stuff, not even relevant to googling python or googling programming. 
This is hilarious and very cool
No. No luck 
Not at all. There are so many task you have to do before and after coding, which counts as work hours. Also a lot of meetings. Sometimes you are so focused coding and getting everything ok that when a meeting occurs you wish you weren’t supposed to attend. I would say it’s a true 4 to 6 hours a day of coding. Some days maybe even less or not coding at all.

Meta refresh tag 60 seconds. But you shouldn't do that just use ajax to push updates
Its a shell redirection, so it is writing to a file called "NUL". You can call your own files anything you like. $ echo "NOBODY expects the Spanish Inquisition" &gt; NUL $ cat NUL NOBODY expects the Spanish Inquisition (I assume the OP is using Linux or Unix, on Windows it might be a reserved file name or something.)

Check out Flask. Much lighter and python based if that’s your Lang of choice. 
Pretty much this. Need something to develop quickly. We are a very small team.
Ah, makes sense, thank you for explanation!
I would teach students to learn to debug with print statements. I have come across many computer languages in the past that did not have debuggers.
Flask is both light-weight and scalable. I can also recommend Aiohttp as a fresh cutting-edge library that outshines Flask in many aspects. Definitely go with Python 3.6+, as 2.7 is going to be no more by the time you are done. As far as ORM, I recommend pyodbc + SQLAlchemy. The latter has a bit of learning curve but I love the leverage it provides. Use SQLAlchemy ORM where speed is not important and you want to map your tables to classes. Use SQLAlchemy Core for everything else. &amp;#x200B;
Not the case today though and many things can be missed from relying on printing as well as accidentily leaving debug statements in production code. Essentially it's the poor mans debugger, which luckily we rarely need to rely on today. Many students will stick to the first thing they learn long enough to limit their advancement. While it can be an occasionally useful tool, it is overall more harmful in the long run. It can be useful as a stepping stone to useing a debugger though. Many poor techniques make a good stepping stone to the right methods as a means of ahowing the limitations and reasons for the proper technique. This doesnt take away from the usefullness of the reflection capabilities for logging or repl usage. But should be taught as such in my opinion (and most educational programming methodologies) as opposed to a debugging method.
Cool!

No, I am relatively new to this and just followed the standard online tutorials. I hade never heard of it before, I'll take a look at this.
Yeah, I just kinda remembered those commands. Would have probably been easier your way. I'll see if it makes sense to replace it in the project.
Because I have to use pip3 I guess it is Python 3.x only?
Yeah, I did not see it. I am at it. Thanks!
I just posted it on GitHub today.
Animal is the class. Dog and human are objects of the animal class. Attributes are what differentiate them. Number of legs etc etc.
yep, however resulting list will not look the same in all 3 cases which is important and should be noted and this code is not good lacking sameness to demonstrate that imo.

I followed “Corey Schafer” on YouTube, I believe he has a full playlist of python tutorials. 
Thanks a lot, I'll check him out.
Ohh my bad, I'm kinda new to reddit.
Thank you guys, appreciate that!
JSON in a file should be enough. 
I sent you a private message. I'd be glad to help you out. I forgot to mention that we participated in pyweek where we used pygame and the creator of pyscroll and pytmx is part of the group. 
&gt;So I want to learn python &gt;... &gt;Ps. tell me if this is more appropriate for /r/learnpython
What libraries are available for python? Do you know?
OP should post on /r/learnpython.
It's not really learning python he just needs someone to help him maintain the project
Thanks for the suggestion, I'll check it out :)
Django isn't a big lift, and its forms and views will make good substitutes for your Access forms. Django has a mechanism to migrate an existing database schema into it's ORM, but I haven't tried it myself. Pyodbc is not a first-class data engineer for Django, compared to postgre or MySQL, but I haven't found anything I haven't been able to work around in a few years of use. So: try the tutorial, see if you still think Django is too complex. I think you'd be surprised at how much you will be able to do with very little effort compared to some of the more lightweight frameworks and add on libraries.
First of all, whatever was said in that SO answer is only relevant to regular expressions one learns in Automata Theory class. It is not true of POSIX regular expressions and their clones, they can typically recognize much more than just regular languages. For example, `(.+)\1` is not a regular language. Now, to the question of speed: if you are able to convince yourself that you will not get false positives by matching against your regexp, and you don't need the structure of XML, and you can come up with an expression that is guaranteed to execute in time linear to the size of your input: do that. Otherwise, it's gambling. Maybe parsing XML will be better, maybe regex with some post-processing. It will really depend on your particular case: there's a whole special sub-discipline in Automata Theory which deals with approximating more expressive languages with regular expressions. And, it's a really interesting subject with a lot of content for research. Ultimately though, proper XML parsing must use some form of stack, so that it allocates more memory the more nested your XML is, though typical XML files are rather shallow, so, in reality this isn't a big problem. And if you aren't interested in entire XML structure of the document, just some fragment of it, XML parsing will spend a lot of time trying unnecessarily match the parts of the documents you don't care about. HTML in particular is known to be very poorly written, so, if you are scrapping HTMLs created by other people using too strict rules may prove to be a fool's errand: there may be just too many invalid inputs, which you still need to process. ---- Bottom line: understand your tools, test your assumptions and do what works best in your case. Blanket statements about X being better than Y are usually false, especially if both X and Y potentially can solve the same problem.
I'm just throwing lambda functions around.
Hello, I can help. I haven't used pygame, but I do a lot of Python module development and I can review your code, if you'd like.

Anaconda has environments, you can use those to isolate different projects from requiring inconsistent dependencies. In a grander scheme of things, dependency management is a difficult problem. All solutions people came up with so far suck big time. Python is not particularly remarkable in this respect: it sucks more than some others and less than some others. But, the road is made by walking: try doing any of those things you thought might be useful, maybe they will, who knows?
That'd be great, I'll send you a message later,
Hi. A small comment on your git repo. You should not include the pycache directory. That directory contains optimized versions of you python files that are generated on the fly as you run your program. Hence it is only unnecessary overhead to have it in the git repo. Good job getting started and goid luck with the game!
Flask boiiiii
Why is flask not scalable
I wrote a package that does almost exactly the same thing. It's called enquiries on pypi. Are you looking for contributors? 
Definitely Django solves a lot of the overhead. Forms, generic class based views, routing, etc. Can't go wrong with it.
Rosetta Code has a [Menu generating task](http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Menu) with Python [solution](http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Menu#Python) that has similar functionality. 
Still getting downvoted! Just trying to steer people to a place where they might get better results. I don't take ANY notice of downvotes that aren't accompanied by an explanatory comment as [suggested in the reddiquette](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette).
Just to be clear I'm not the author of the article. I proposed the link here because I think it's interesting to know about this change in Python community. 
Looking at the video my first thought was that if you're looking for pixels with different colors, *you're not discriminating between projectiles or other characters*. Furthermore, there appears to be some complexity in the pattern of the shots as well. I can imagine that at some point there are just too many projectiles for your character to navigate between. This would mean you would just have to back up a little. I also saw that the game is not full screen. This is good because it saves you processing power during the grabbing of the image. Also, all projectile appear to be white in this case. Perhaps you could try to simplify the image before processing (looking up the projectiles). maybe try turning it to gray scale with a strong threshold for black. Lastly, you're character seems to always be in the middle of the screen. Maybe you can make a bounding box for him that you can use to calculate whether he is not getting hit. All in all I think it is a really fun idea. Looking forward to seeing it evolve. If you want we could discuss some more :) Haven't got a lot of time lately but I'd still like to hobby on the side. Good luck! 
Alright, I would be more than happy to discuss about this project with you. Currently the program ignores the player since it is colorful. I have been thinking of the ways of doing this and to this day I havent had a clear path that I could follow for this project. Also the projectiles enemies shoot are usually colorful.
I'm doing something similar with PyGame right now and it's really easy to reach it's limit when you have many surfaces. Blitting takes ages, literally most of the time my code is blitting surfaces to the screen. You can mitigate it a little and also my code is far from efficient, but (correct me if I'm wrong) at the end of the day you're still using the CPU and you'd have to work with OpenGL anyways via PyGame if you want really good graphics performance. I've been testing the same thing with Pyglet (also OpenGL) and the framerates have exploded.
I will. If it doesn't break everything, I'll report back :)
A vim keybinding for scrolling through completion suggestions. Stands for next/previous.
The questions are simple, but offered solutions are not very good. The one for Question 5 is even wrong - for the number 8 this should return (4, 4) because 4 is in the list twice... 
Lol
No problemo 👍
I don't mind that either, I don't know were to go. If you could give places where I can do that I would be grateful
I did not know that existed. We more or less cover the same thing in a very similar manner. Sorry for the competition 😬. I made it because I needed it. I would have used yours if I knew of it. If there is anything you think is still lacking feel free to open an issue or even create a pull request. I'd be happy about it!
I think I need to reword this, `ASGI Framework Lifespan error, continuing without Lifespan support`. Which states it is an error when it is in fact just a warning. The issue is that Quart 0.6.X supports the provisional lifespan API, whereas Quart 0.7.X onwards (once released) will support the finalized API. Hypercorn 0.4.X supports both the provisional and final API. So in either case you can use the `before_serving/after_serving` system.
I should really start checking the upload dates, either way really cool repo!
What's your least favorite food from KFC? 
That is awesome. I was using Dialog for such things but it required people to install the native dialog tool and was generally cumbersome. I switched to your module in a minute and it's much more effective. I'm sure that my colleague will love the new version of my tool. I might try to add a select() with a dictionary so you can see the values and it will return the key instead of the array index.
Nope I'm clean. You should step back before I tell you how many codeacademy courses I've started but not finished and make you look bad

My response when you make a bug-free program: "No you didn't."
It's pretty unbelievable isn't it. Am I a guru? Should I sell a small portion of my immense knowledge online for a low, low monthly fee you'd have to be a moron to pass up on?
Aye; similar - for some definition of similar :-) &amp;#x200B;
As most of you are pointing out my post isn't entirely correct so I'll fix that here. It wasn't like this the FIRST time I made a bug free program. The title should read: "QA's response when I make YET ANOTHER bug free program." Thank you all for your patience
&gt;bug free program The ghosts are more likely.
OK sorry for assume so 
Sounds like you're so invested in the design you should probably write it yourself, but [click](https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/7.x/complex/#building-a-git-clone) is probably the best toolkit out there for building more complex CLI tools. It's got a decorator-heavy interface for convenience, but it's all implemented using OOP that seems to map to your description.
QA guy here. I promise you’re program isn’t bug free. Either that or you forgot a feature in the spec sheet
It's not even for the OPs project.

For those too lazy to look at the GitHub, what is this? Not me of course - I'm not lazy - I was just thinking of other people
I highly encourage you to just look at their README. It is highly entertaining. 
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 is distributed with `Python 3.6`. The package is not installed by default. To install `Python 3.6`, use the `yum install python3` command. `Python 2.7` is available in the `python2` package. However, `Python 2` will have a shorter life cycle and its aim is to facilitate smoother transition to `Python 3` for customers. Neither the default `python` package nor the unversioned `/usr/bin/python` executable is distributed with RHEL 8. Customers are advised to use `python3` or `python2` directly. Alternatively, administrators can configure the unversioned `python` command using the `alternatives` command. For details, see [Using Python 3 in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8-beta/html-single/configuring_basic_system_settings/#using-python3). (BZ#1580387)
&gt; The web devs tell me that fuckit's versioning scheme is confusing, and that I should use "Semitic Versioning" instead. So starting with fuckit version ה.ג.א, package versions will use Hebrew Numerals.
I think Beethoven was like Beethiven with keys.
### 6.1.1. Python versions Two incompatible versions of Python are widely used, Python 2.x and Python 3.x. Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 uses Python 3.6 by default. However, Python 2.7 is also provided to support existing software.
Holy mother of god...
I've heard this analogy countless times. It makes sense to people who understand classes but it kind of meaningless to those who don't. I can personally relate to this because I heard the analogy a dozen times before I actually understood OOP and every time I sat there and kinda nodded along. I think this is because without a true justification for their existence, classes seem like arbitrary complexity. Talking about animals and dog classes just reinforces that confusion, in my experience. It wasn't until I was taught Object Oriented programming and actually understood the goal that python classes were trying to achieve did it all click. OOP is built on four ideas. Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism. Once you understand the driving force behind those ideas it is instantly clear why classes are they way they are. 
Thank you very much for the kind words and the advice!! I took it down. 
And DaVinci was DaVinci with his hands. That's the joke.
Hey look at you getting it. Good job buddy
You thought people making fun of python programmers for using too many imports was bad? Lol we're only just beginning. Imports are the tip of the fuckitpy iceberg.
Hahaha
Maybe. Seems like he might be capable of keeping up.
Hey there! This has been removed. You may want to post to r/ProgrammerHumor instead.
Rude
Damn that's pretty neat! Is there a subreddit that shows people creations you've made using programming? Even better if there's one for certain languages. Every now and then there's a gem like this on r/python , but I'd much rather have a place that for sure exhibits things like this for people to see. &amp;#x200B; Aside from that, really great job OP! I love cool niche things like this.
Will this work for distributing to people without Python knowledge and Python installed?
Hahaha holy fuck
Also see Petr Viktorin's blog article on [developers.redhat.com/blog](https://developers.redhat.com/blog) \- [Python in RHEL 8](https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2018/11/14/python-in-rhel-8/)
That's actually really neat! What do you mean by GUI? Like is it on the webpage or is separate from that entirely?
Yes, you can package up a Python distribution alongside the PyXLL add-in to distribute it to those without Python installed. No Python knowledge is required to use the add-in from Excel. You would either need a license to be able to distribute your add-in built using PyXLL, or otherwise each user would need their own PyXLL license. Send a message via [https://www.pyxll.com/contact.html](https://www.pyxll.com/contact.html) to discuss the best way forward for your use-case.
For anyone wondering what’s going on under the hood it’s calling into PIL to quantise the colours, which by default uses median-cut.
One thing that beginners always get stuck on is learning. It's great to learn, but to learn always means to practice. As one user has already said, taking up a project forces you to learn and practice at the same time and really makes concepts stick. I highly suggest finding a project of interest to you and pursuing it (within reason of course). If you have ideas, there's plenty of inspiration online. For instance: I recently started working on an instagram bot that takes memes from reddit and posts them to an instagram account every hour :)
No I have not, could you tell me more about this?
Sorry might have come across as little sarcastic. This was intended in the spirit of fun I assure you!
Could you elaborate more on this project?
Also something that I'm wondering: a lot of the rows have repeat data, for example in column 1 represents the year (there is only 6 years worth of data) to reduce memory do i need to represent the year in every single row of data? or only when the year changes(once every \~1M rows)
Dockerize?
Hmm. I feel I need to give a defence of print statements. * Logging versus print statements. Debugging by *adding logging*. Can be a good approach because it results in software that can be debugged with logging. This is beneficial because: i. it makes later debugging easier, ii. it allows you to debug code "remotely" by having people send you details, iii. it allows you to debug production code without having to wire up a debugging etc. * Debuggers can sometimes encourage "mindlessly stepping through your code". They *needn't* but they can. The default action with print statements is a "what is going on here question". It encourages thinking about what you want to find out and why, and adds a cost to discovering things. The default action of debuggers in go here and single step. Obviously this is not how you need to use debuggers and they often have a range of features more powerful than print statements (e.g. tell me when this memory address gets updated). I think a mindset of being aware of "what do I want to know" and "how can I find it" as separate from "use a debugger" can be useful, and I think print statements are a good way to introduce this. 
OP here. Pixelhouse was created to fill the gap between plotting (via matplotlib/bokeh) and rendering (blender/povray/etc...). Creating silly 2D animations was *\_hard\_* and it took the joy out of python. Please experiment and play with the library. I'm not a developer, so I'll take any criticism you may have to make the library better or add new, fun features. On the technical side, the backend is CV2, which was used because it was fast enough and had a bunch of easy to use built in primitives. This also means that you should be able to couple this with your computer vision demos and draw less ugly bounding boxes / annotations around your latest and greatest video demos.
This is really cool - I've been wanting to do something like this with my Phillips Hue lights (extract dominating colors and use that in real time to set my lighting). Will check out the repo on Github. Cool stuff!
If the random seed is the same, yes, but that is very very unlikely

Care to justify your logic here?:
Really nice. 
* I already referenced the logging, which is definitely helpful in directing debugging. * What you are describing here is how to use a debugger. The "what is going here" you are describing is setting a breakpoint, deciding where to set the breakpoint is the same thinking that you are attributing to adding print statements. * The default action of a debugger is not to single step, but to stop here. If you would have added a print statement where you set a breakpoint, you can see the entire state of the program and decide what is happening. For this you would need an unmanageable number of print statements. * Print statements require you to continually rerun the program, adding/changing/removing code each time, making for a lot of extra work. Additionally, adding/changing/removing code ensures you are never actually running the same code twice. Finally, the code must be removed at the end. * You don't need to use print statements to think about what is happening in your code, and being able to see everything occurring using a wide range of tools outside of a print statement is more effective, and modern teach methods would agree. As I said earlier, we frequently teach programming methodologies by introducing the wrong method to show its downsides as a bridge to the proper methods. This is as far as I can see print statements as debugging being truly useful.
the project started as a cli, i wanted to add more functionality and most of the current features could be easily/greatly improved by adding a visual component. \[Heres\]([https://github.com/amcquade/fresh\_script](https://github.com/amcquade/fresh_script)) the code if youre interested in contributing!
I tried this a while ago: https://dask.org/ though ended up not using it. But, not because it was somehow bad or anything, just solved the problem differently. What the library above does, it can chunk up a big data-frame into smaller pieces and process it piece-wise, perhaps on multiple threads / processes / computers.
said it when it was posted before and will say it again: instead re-creating the wheel, just go with xlwings or another library which is more mature than this. The repo wasn't even published and you're looking for someone maintaining and developing it. Why on earth would anyone volunteer here?
If distutils in all their wisdom didn't decide to remove the package version from the directory structure where it was installed, nobody would need to separate Pythons into system / user, nobody would need virtual environments and other convoluted programs that will not be mentioned here such as not to create unnecessary ad campaign.
Folks, check out this blog post if you are interested in performing exploratory data analysis using Python. This blog post covers various techniques such as univariate and bivariate analysis, missing value treatment, building a correlation matrix, outlier analysis etc with code samples. IMHO EDA – plays a critical role in understanding the what, why, and how of the problem statement. It’s first in the order of operations that a data analyst will perform when handed a new data source and problem statement.
The author of `click` doesn't understand what purpose does language locale serve, which makes this library unusable by design. I'm also skeptical about other choices this library made, but it's a matter of taste.

LOL! Are you saying I should ditch OOD for that case?
Personally I find the overuse of decorators a no-go. They are not implemented the way they should be, imho.
That _might_ be an indication your imho is overly restrictive and or dogmatic. That said your statement is a little ambiguous; if you mean decorator syntax in general, well Python is not OO-only by design, if you're referring only to Click, the decorator syntax is just to allow "easy" composition, you can always use inheritance if you're more of a masochist. 
I am referring to Click only. Yeah I'm more of a masochist, but it's probably due to the classes I attended in university.
Probably. Be aware that in the outside-university, strictly-professional world quite a few classically-taught OOP ideas are somewhat moving towards the wayside, most notably inheritance (at the very least multiple inheritance) over composition. Armin's work has typically been highly opinionated but also eminently practical. As a reformed masochist, I'd tend to just use **click** and not try to overthink. But if you're enjoying the masochism, please be my guest.
In RHEL 8, one of the things that is fixed by having all system stuff use platform-python is that if someone follows the bad advice to build from source and do a `make install` as root, they won't break yum, etc. the way that would in RHEL 7 and earlier. However, Note from Petr's article, while there is a separate binary for platform python, the modules for platform-python and /usr/bin/python3 are still shared. So someone doing `sudo pip install` could still do damage.
Yes, I wonder if RedHat should patch \`pip\` to warn in the case of trying to install with \`sudo\`?
I always thought it would be cool if libraries on github (just for example) had an area for developers to submit projects they have built using that library, and it would show up on a web page somewhere.
Working on understanding [Sphinx extensions.](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/extdev/index.html#dev-extensions) I'm using a few that I would like to contribute to but am having trouble understanding the code or the best way to develop against Sphinx. 
Very cool, I'll test it. My wife has a little wool / yarn coloring shop and sometimes she gets a custom order with an image and that's neat to extract the colors. For example: one customer wanted the colors of her favorite parrot. Now I can make a quick palette for her. Makes things a little easier, I hope. 👍
This is awesome, but why a flask app? Is there a web interface? Can I just use it as a python module?
nice, you can tweak the palette too. like a white outline will look more good, and perhaps with less outline width as the image is not wide
The refusal to work with the C locale is a pretty good indication that Armin Ronacher have some unsound and misguided ideas about locales. I agree with /u/crabbone on this.

You could probably scrape the most common dependency files and calculate a graph from that (like package.json). Easier to automate.

To me it sounds like you want to just make a Web app that serves some information. Yes you can do it in python. Yes you can use docker to containerize it. Your first step should be simply to get a web app working on your local machine. You probably should first start with being able to scrape the data you want from the website (or an `&lt;a href="`[`https://github.com/spinach/FantasyPremierLeague-Api.py`](https://github.com/spinach/FantasyPremierLeague-Api.py)`"&gt;api&lt;/a&gt;`). From there come up with a way of organizing your data and just create a web app on your local machine. Plenty of tutorials on how to do that. Once you have something working on your local machine, then you can look to containerize it with docker. Docker can run your python scripts and runs it well. I just implemented System Level Testing using Python and Docker at my current place of work. There are tons docker tutorials, and almost all of them involve some kind of basic "Hello World!" web app. For writing scripts, you can use pretty much anything. Pycharm is smart and can usually detect most simple python errors for you. Visual Studio Code is also a good choice with the Python Plugin, plus, it has a Docker Plugin for when you get there, as well as Plugins for Web based Dev, so that may work better for you. If you put your project on github, you can use docker to just pull your project with git and run it from there. Otherwise you have local files and can use the add/copy commands to get them there if you need to. I also agree, you should move this over to `&lt;a href="`[`https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython`](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython)`"&gt;/r/learnpython&lt;/a&gt;` for more help.
This post is asking if people want to contribute to the project not asking a question about python in excel.
I use Python for most of my works, recently I decided to learn a FL, I'm going to give Elixier a chance
I'd add C++, instead of C. He'll be missing too much with C. It's a huge leap from Python huge built-in libraries to the bare bones C. Having said that, learning C is very important for getting to the next level in CS.
You need something that chunks the data from disk, such as PyTables or `bcolz`. 
How about making a CLI with [click](https://github.com/p) and make a linux service for it or use [Suervisor](http://supervisord.org)
Python for Data Analysis is not going to teach you the fundamentals of data analysis and is quite inefficient with several of its operations. I am extremely biased so take treat what I say lightly. See my blog post reviewing every line of the book - [https://medium.com/dunder-data/python-for-data-analysis-a-critical-line-by-line-review-5d5678a4c203](https://medium.com/dunder-data/python-for-data-analysis-a-critical-line-by-line-review-5d5678a4c203)
Seems very nice. I'll give it a try? Do you plan to publish it on PiPy?
The book doesn’t teach data analysis. It’s to instruct how a data analyst can use pandas to do what they need it to do. Wes developed pandas when he was at AQR. 
I hadn't; you think it's worth it?
Was recently (last Friday :D) offered a QA job at my internship because of my python skills! I was asked to start automating some of the ‘manual’ calculations we perform to validate our financial models, and my boss was super impressed by how quickly it progressed! I’m using python SDK to extract financial information from my company’s benchmark dictionary and read user input data, then to replicate the software results. So far I’ve got the method down for one instrument and now I’m building a robust class structure to handle the two dozen or so instruments our software offers! 
you should make this into a PyPi package that one could use in their project!
Okay, yes I am programming what I meant to say was area shall I look into to get the most money. I don't care about the work, or programming I want to make money
If this is your first project, do not use docker. First you have to learn Python, and the pythonic way of programming. You can test your code directly on your computer. Then, when you want to put your project in production, you can start thinking about docker (containers in general). You can use any text editor to edit the scripts, not just the ones you mentioned. But try to find an editor that gives you text highlighting (gives special colors to certain keywords ) because the coding experience is going to be better. I hope you enjoy developing this project, glad you are using Python (hopefully Python 3.X)
Well like it or not java is used quite a lot so never wrong to learn it. Depending on the industry you want to work in, the languages vary. Anyways, have a look at scala. 
Another one.
Why is this on spotify?
They intent to do it on RHEL7, but got cold feets. Now, when python 2.7 is the last python2 version, with clear deadline on 2020, and python3 is (much more) stable, there is no need to be afraid of doing it.
Is your data made of strings? Can you map these to integers?
Nice! On a side note.... Source for the picture? I wants that as my PC background
I'm saying there is no logical reason to stop there in dividing people by their attributes, and once this is started being enforced by political means (we're already there) there will be always the next "smaller" group that will fight for their "rights". It's a pure fallacy. The society should focus on EQUAL OPPORTUNITY. Enforcing EQUAL OUTCOMES is just plain stupid. Nobody is mentioning that police, underground miners, or soldiers being overwhelmingly male; most workplace injuries are male. I don't hear you advocating that we enforce 50:50 gender "equality" there? This the infantile, inconsistent thinking that is "cool" today. And with righteousness.
&gt;&gt;But it still doesn't male sense that we have less than 20% non white &gt;&gt;attendees in Python Brazil conferences. That's the outcome of OPPORTUNITIES. And we should give EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES for all. However, enforcing OUTCOMES is what is wrong. Check out studies which show that statistically females/males have different PREFERENCES. This means is that even under completely EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES there will be UNEQUAL OUTCOMES.
Hey Mayank I worked with you on flask project about 6 months ago, glad to see you are still doing Flask stuff, really nice work. :)
See now this is the type is application I like to see. Something s little different then the same old programs that people post. 
No box plots? Looks like a nice addition to python viz landscape.
an invalid word is not a word :) But I think it depends more on the speed of the search algorithm used to search the dictionary, the speed of the algorithm used to create combinations of letters from the string, and then the loops used to link these two together to produce a word list.
&gt; As of 3.7 Python's just coercing C.ASCII to C.UTF-8 anyway Are you serious? This is really a whole new level of absurd... Do you have a reference to changelog or dev. mailing list where this was decided? There are a lot of places where there is no support for UTF-8 (all sorts of embedded devices), why on Earth would anyone do something as retarded as lie about system's locale, to only make things worse? Another problem with this idea is that file names, and a lot of other data provided by system API will be encoded using C locale, but your code will not know that and may crash with all sorts of arcane errors when doing something as benign as opening a file for writing etc. By the way, there is no real problem with Python interpreter and locales. It actually didn't really change much in this respect since 2.5 or some such. It is mostly renaming and bad defaults, but you can actually make it work with any locale you need.
This is awesome, where did you get the idea from?
I think the code overall look well written, but one thing I noticed was you could put the execution of the main function in the if statement like if __name__ == '__main__': main() that way if you or someone else wants to use the function they could import the file without the main function executing. &amp;#x200B;

Thanks for pointing that out
&gt; I'm saying there is no logical reason to stop there in dividing people by their attributes Again, provide an example. That sounds like a slippery slope fallacy. Can't let the gays marry because then the polgamists will want to marry and then cats and dogs will. &gt; and once this is started being enforced by political means (we're already there) Political correctness and social pressure the same thing. It's not enforced by politics and it's certainly not true among all groups. &gt; The society should focus on EQUAL OPPORTUNITY. You mean and not judge someone for being gay or black? That sounds like political correctness to me. &gt; Enforcing EQUAL OUTCOMES is just plain stupid. Who said that was ever the goal? We can promote women in tech without them cracking 30%. Even so, would that really be bad? In the 1950s, men dominated nursing. Today, women do. &gt; I don't hear you advocating that we enforce 50:50 gender "equality" there? Uhhh...what? I wasn't advocating it because I believe it and expect that position of others. I'm not a better than a woman because I'm a guy. I might be better at math or better at cooking than a woman, but I'm equal in terms of worth. I don't want a subordinate partner.
i had a lot of surveys made by hand and these needed to be tabulated in GSheets, for further analysis. So to log the items there with Gforms i made a script which let me log with digits depending on the available options: - So if for example a question had just only one posibility to answer but four options, then i just put the number from 1 to 4 depending on the answer i wanted to fill. - There were another where i needed to fill text so the scrpt alert me it is a text entry so i write and press enter, and automatically it is written in the form and skips to thenext question. - Also if there are multiple options available to choose from and multiple answers possibility, the script would tell me this is a special kind of answer so it first ask me how many options are going to be filled, if there were for example 5 options and i choose 3 of them, it will then ask me from 1 to 5 which of those i am going to fill, and then it proceeds to fill them. - and the last one of these is when there are just one possible answer but the last option is a text to fill, (this is when you have three options available and the las one is other:______ ) so i just press 0 and it knows it has to fill that one and asks for a text input. And in the end it just sends the form and starts all over again. Basically thats it, but i know it can be optimized in future or it can be made way more pythonic. Also it uses the chromium webdriver so it starts opening a new window side by side of the IDE (Pycharm) so i can look live what i am doing in the form.
First, _most_ Linux distros don't qualify as "conforming systems" per POSIX. For that matter, POSIX only _requires_ the C locale be the default for C-language programs, specifically, when `setlocale` isn't called, and for everything else it's whatever the system default is, and the implementation can set a UTF-8 default if it wants to... so is it a "reasonable default"? Sure -- well, if your first language is ASCII-compatible, at least -- but that doesn't mean it's not a perfectly valid choice to say you aren't writing for full-POSIX compatibility (after all, practically speaking all of the most commonly used OSs don't even try), and that your code is meant to operate in a world where at minimum a UTF-8 locale has been set. Might not be a choice you agree with, but to attack someone -- which includes the way you're describing your views of their skill set -- for making that choice isn't reasonable in a world where more than half the human population live in countries where the C locale is just another absurdly insufficient holdover from the days of imperialism. He made an opinionated choice as an apparent protest against what he saw as a stupid flub on the part of the Python interpreter development team -- a flub they seem to be solving in 3.7 by coercing C to C.UTF-8 -- as far as I can tell he fully understands the subject, he just made a choice you disagree with.

1. Reduce space requirements. If you process your df find ways to do it in place. As u/xela314159 said find ways to represent your data in a smart way. Also have a look at the dtypes you are using, maybe you could reduce them. 2. Do things like chunking. If you are generating the df generate it partly save it to the disk, clean the memory and create the next part. If you load a large df use the chunking options pandas is already giving you. 3. If your df is something more like a matrix and it's containing a lot of zeros sparse matrices save a looot of space. 
The upcoming 1.4 release of pyglet also includes support for easily switching between 2D and 3D window projections (pyglet.window.Projection2D and pyglet.window.Projection3D). There is also a new \`model\` module for easily loading in 3D models. There is support for \`obj\` files, and unfinished experimental support for glTF. Users can write their own codecs for any format. (I did a lot of this work)
Haha! Nope. I actually liked the problem. I guess you are also learning about algorithms! All the Best :) 
Very nice and helpful!
Hah I was gonna write this myself, thanks for doing the work!

Look up PEP 538. Python's not exactly the first to abandon the ASCII only idiocy of the C locale, and it won't be the last. Unicode's been standardized for quite a while now, and most of the embedded hardware ultimately ships from countries that don't use ASCII-only, so I'd be surprised if the impact of this is anywhere near as catastrophic as you seem to think it might be.
Flask is how you get the upvotes
&gt; Nobody should be using system python for userland stuff. Except all the sysadmins who insist that all applications must be packaged for the system package manager and use the system Python, and who go on tirades against pip and virtual environments.
GeoViews (http://geoviews.org) provides a high-level interface based on Cartopy, Bokeh, and Matplotlib for working with geographic data.
hvPlot (http://hvplot.pyviz.org) and HoloViews (http://holoviews.org) both provide one-line plotting for even fairly complex use cases, using different types of APIs (a Pandas-centered API for hvPlot and a declarative-data API for HoloViews).
Have you ever used xlwings? I have. There is a reason this was built. There are many differences between xlwings and this.
Absolutely perfect application for this. 
yeah, that's the talk. the other talk is really great too, and lays out an argument for keeping things as simple as possible for composition. There is also a time element involved, and if your config is highly dynamic (enabled by them being classes instead of just a flat text file perhaps) then can you really say what state your app was in when something horrible happened? Kinda ties in to the sentiment that some people have of "configurability is the root of all evil" https://fishshell.com/docs/current/design.html#design-configurability None of this is directed at this project really, just the problem space in general (and I like discussing it). All of these decisions have to be made in context, and would vary wildly depending on if you're making a webapp or a financial backend, etc.
Invoke `ldd` on a binary/library and see if loader can find libz. If it can't, define `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` variable in environment and point it at the directory with libraries. If it's something else, you'll have to provide more information, like exact error message.

I would sort the input letters and compare such sample with each sorted word of the same length from dictionary. No idea how fast it would take me, but algorithm is pretty trivial, so not long.

Interesting, I've used kmeans algorithm in scipy to do this in the past, didn't know PIL had that built in.
And I was pointing to /r/learnpython as a place that contains people who have shown that they know something about python. Despite the noise over there, there are a few cluey people around. I wasn't issuing a grumpy "go away".
Nicely done!
It's not really a case of write websites and get money. It's more about making someone something that they are willing to pay for. If companies reached out to you, they probably have something specific in mind and that's what you should use to answer your own question when it comes to what you should specialize on? Keep in mind to not have any fairytale dreams about the industry, it's arguably the most accessible end of the programming industry and competition is wild. Do your research and pick a stack to learn, and work hard.
PiePeye ;)
I wish Apple would do this too. I get tired of explaining why it's a bad idea to use the system Python on OS X.
Thanks!
Yes. Just do custom install and select the folder path/name you want. (I.e. c:\python3.6). Also might want to consider the version you want as default to be first in your environment path. Also setup alias for each so that you know which one you are calling.
That’s why I gave you one!
Yes, works for arbitrary number of items
Plotting is easy in python. I don't really need yet another library to do it. I am extremely interested in a quality, easy to use, lightweight geoscatter/choropleth/GIS mapping visualization libraries that look good out of the box. Does this do any of those things?
Can do it in N preprocessing time, N space, and constant lookup time. N is number of words in the dictionary. Build a map by reading over a dictionary.txt file. The keys are sorted_string and values are lists of words made from the characters in the key string. When given an input string, sort it, and just return the list in the map. This challenge would be a lot more interesting if you were only given a partial word and outputting autocomplete suggestions. A partial word would be missing up to two characters lets say, or possibly up to two characters have been mistyped, or there are up to 2 additional unnecessary characters. 
Hii, its amazing that what led me to your project was Reddit.. it never ceases to amaze me!!. Thanks man:)
Yeah nice, am currently in school , will update soon. Thanks!!
Hey thanks for writing this. I referred [Pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/5.3.x/reference/Image.html) documentation for the project and picked it up from there. But yeah I should not reuse the variable name. Will update it. also is the space between "palette height" will not give any problem?
Thanks man!

Firstly, this should really be posted to /r/learnpython Secondly, this isn't something you need to solve with Python (unless you're looking for a project to do, bored etc.). There are already plenty of paid and free/open source ticketing/queue systems that would be suitable. If you want to go ahead with this, rather post in /r/learnpython As for libraries, you'll want to make this a web app so you'll need Flash or Django (I've only used Django, but I hear Flash is good for beginners). Also, if you don't have any programming experience (esp if you don't have any experience with Python) this is will be quite a large task
I believe that was a typo. He means to put spaces around the operator (+)
Amazing work bud.
Thanks for the pointers. I have very basic understanding of python - functions, conditionals, arrays, keys. I’m just looking for a project to learn while I build. Again, thanks for the pointer :)
Can you run it backwards to find movies by giving it a color pallet?
[Plotly](https://plot.ly/python/#maps) is ok for some of that stuff. 
Plotly and folium are both okay. It's when you get to 10k+ coordinates they start chugging
Thanks. I'll play around with it. 
Very cool library! Thanks for putting it out there. I teach kids coding and this would interest a few of them. We've used Scratch and Processing a bit. I've played with Pygame and other game frameworks too, but there's usually too much boilerplate. One thing I'd love, because I find it's a useful sandbox for beginners, is a way to run this library from a REPL - i.e. draw a canvas, throw a few primitives up, change their attributes. Not sure if that's possible for this library. I did try to run it from the Python prompt but found that I had to Cmd-Q the Python window to close it - which also quit my Python prompt too. Again, probably not a use case you are shooting for here - but anyways.... I'd also love a way to bring interactivity into it - i.e. move things via key presses etc... Once, again - this might be outside the scope. 
The project is called Colorfy and can be found on here: https://github.com/davidkrantz/Colorfy It fetches the album artwork of the current Spotify playback and from that finds a suitable background color that is then set to a LED-strip if it's playing on a Chromecast. 
Like to send picture to bot and return the colors?
Should show the total aswell! 
What do you mean? Looks the same to me

Like I said I don’t have any experience with image processing
Just noticed it yes I meant to put spaces around the operator
Do Spotify document their API?
Still a noob but as far as I have read, I think using `with...` with longer code is more important because it can automatically deal with errors (which have a higher chance of occuring if you have more code) which you would otherwise deal using `try...except...finally...` and would still indent the whole code. If indentation is a problem, you could abstract (is this the right word here?) it away into a function that you call in the `with...` block
OK, I see, well, let me explain in more detail why this is such a retarded idea... Suppose, I am a graphic designer, who likes typography. I like designing fonts. Suppose, you liked a font I designed and want to use in your system. Now, if you say the standard *requires* only 128 or 256 characters, that's a lot of work, but I can do this in a month or two. Unicode is a whole different story though... it's about 100000 characters. It is impossible for a single person to implement such a font. It is impossible for a small graphic design shop to do that either: they would have to hire specialists proficient in many different languages to design such a font, and this is very expensive. In other words, a standard requirement of Unicode makes this part of development exclusive to large corporations like MS or Adobe, who can afford an international army of graphic designers. ---- Now, suppose you didn't care, there are further problems. Suppose, I wanted to run a Python script on my Roomba. The text output I will ever need from it is: debugging and minimalistic status display at best. The space on Roomba's SD card is very expensive: I'd compile the minimalist version of Python, w/o sqlite, Tk, FFI etc. extras. But, now, suddenly... I have to supply it with fonts which have emoticons in them, Etruscan script and road sign? Seriously?
This is very cool. I used to write software renderers for video games in the 90s. Just before graphics cards with 3D took off. I thought it was a lost art!
Yes. If you're Etruscan. Though you're being pointlessly hyperbolic, setting the locale doesn't imply installing a full font set or for that matter using any character outside the ASCII set, and you know it. The straw man alone makes this no longer worth pursuing, but your senseless use of "retarded" -- in any character set -- completely lost you my interest and attention.
No problem, I will add some improvements and make to more general then share it. I’m still a noob and someone will improve it much better.
&gt; your code is meant to operate in a world where at minimum a UTF-8 locale has been set No, and no. I don't want this crap. I don't want UTF-8 locale. Not as default. When I have to interact with local web-sites or something similar, then yes. Other than that, I don't want any Unicode. I live in Israel, so, by your assumption I should want he_IL.UTF-8 or at least en_IL.UTF-8, right? The hell no! The reason is that localized programs always and universally suck. Nobody has resources to localize their stuff properly: it's expensive and experts will use non-localized versions anyways. Not to mention that, for example Hebrew subset of Unicode doesn't have it's own punctuation (unlike Arabic, but there are other issues too), and so it must use Latin punctuation, but this breaks the layout because it confuses the editor about the direction of the text it has to display. This makes virtually all Hebrew text in digital form painful to read. In Arabic, where they have their own punctuation there's a problem with digits. In some Arabic-speaking countries in day-to-day use, the Latin digits are more popular, in others they stick to Arabic, but when you use Latin digits in computer you get the same problem as with Hebrew punctuation, but if you use Arabic, nothing anymore is recognized as a phone number, all other kinds of search involving numeric information fail etc. ---- Finally: &gt; as far as I can tell he fully understands the subject, he just made a choice you disagree with. Of course not. Have even try to read my explanation? Locales are hints, not requirements. If he doesn't understand that, he's just not the right person to deal with this subject. This is too basic of an error to make.
I don't think so, as movies may not have a constant palette throughout the run time, it may be constant for small section of scenes. Also I can't find a database or api that provides the palettes of movies, which we can match with the provided user palette
Thanks!
This is really cool! Thanks for sharing!
Another approach would be the application of clustering algorithms such as k-means on the pixel rgb data.
Python can make far better images ... see here: [https://github.com/neozhaoliang/pywonderland](https://github.com/neozhaoliang/pywonderland) &amp;#x200B;
Writing python code for this miiiiiight've been faster than editing manually in gimp....
Funnily enough I have worked on this stuff at my old job. KMeans does this OK but generally median cut behaves *a lot better*. PIL actually does support kmeans for this it’s just not the default. Also, there’s actually a large chance that you used PIL without realising through scipy. Skimage (part of scipy) uses PIL under the hood for some number of things.
It's probably because terminal try to use python 2.x installed on your machine. That package comes with macos. Try to use "python3 /path/to/file".
Very very nice, and about time too. Those python backtraces can cause snow blindness. One bug report though, if I may... Your PrettyErrors.configure() method has a "full_line_newline" argument that isn't handled.
Just try it? PyCharm Community is free. VSCode is also totally free. Takes maybe 10 minutes to install both.
I am a Java engineer, using Eclipse for as long as I can remember (version 2.1 was my first one I think?). Still use it, and love it for Java. For PHP a co-worker showed me a few tricks with type hinting, linting, auto format and... of course... how to change shortcuts to eclipse. Now I've changed roles and am assigned to work on an open source python program at work, for the next two years. I used to use PyDev, but then when I compared its auto complete and integration with test/linter/docker, and after trying PyCharm for a couple of weeks, I decided to continue using it as main Python IDE, and I don't regret. For me the only thing I miss from Eclipse is the IDE, and the customization of things like when to build the project, having multiple projects open, working sets... planning to check PyDev in a few months, but not sure if I will give up PyCharm now.
The first one is a bitwise operation, meaning that it actions at binary level, applying the logical and operator on each pair of individual bits. (kind of applying a bit mask). The other one is a logical operator. It works on a boolean level, and in that case, it will always display the second number, because it evaluates the truth values of the two numbers. Eg. 14 and 6 = 14(true) and 6(true) = true. Returning the concrete value is because of how the expressions are evaluated. In the case of and: evaluate the first one. Is true? if not, return it. if yes, return the 2nd one. It will return the correct result , for every boolean combination. Consider the `or` operator next. It works the same, except that if the first item is true, returns it, if it is false, returns the 2nd. As a nice-to-know tip, you can use the or operator to assign default values to some variable instead of a falsy one (eg. instead of a `None`, `""`, `[]`, `{}`, etc.) like this: `my_var = user_input_val or "this is the default"`. Hope it helps, and sorry that the explication is all over the place.
Thanks. Where do I put that? 
Write it on clear terminal. Or you can go to the folder that contains your script by "cd" command and then type "script.py"
Well, I think the reason you usually don't bother for images is that reading the image is like the main thing of your code. If you can't read the image, the program might as well crash? :D Though I'm guessing that if you're writing a GUI app you might want to show an error instead of crashing. And you could do something like: ``` with .... img = image.read(file) img = .... ```
Svaka vam čast :)
Have never used pydev/eclipse but pycharm is sooooo good, that I had comment here too. Don't know if pydev comes with django support, database viewer, html/css/web support built in, material UI's, tons of extensions, sexy debugging, remote host uploads etc. etc. etc. - working with PyCharm has been an absolute joy in the last few month's in which I've been using it on a daily basis. It simply is fun to do stuff in it. *using the paid version.
Might be interesting for the guys over on r/unixporn to extract the right colours for/from their background image. Feel free to get your Karma ;)

Then they're living in the early 2000s. DevOps: You build it, you run it. It's sort of like the whole reason for containers to begin with (which pip/envs are a poor man's version of).
In .NET-land, you'd use SxS assemblies. Which I guess was what distutils was *supposed* also do at one point. (But got stuck at the LD_LIBRARY_PATH/ld.so.conf (libmap.conf in BSD) level)...
hvalaaaa trudimo se :D sherujte mnogo je zeznuto odavde da dizemo hype na netu :)
Yep. Spotipy is the python api lib, afaik 
The interwebs is already so diluted with programming amateurs thinking they can teach people without knowing some principles of the language they are trying to teach. This brings us to a whole shit ton of videos saying "if you type this this this and that, thing happens. Copy this and try it out" Which I mean, does help others dip their toe into it, but really doesn't teach shit, just shows how something is done, which is completely different. If you want to do a video series about python basics, that's completely your choice. My advice for this would be to go beyond showing code and how it runs, explain why it does what it does, explain the functions and packages you use. Give reasoning on why you are doing what you are doing. If someone comments on your video saying you should be doing something a different way, LISTEN. Research the methods they are mentioning. Do some tests yourself to see which way would be more suitable.
That is exactly what I was thinking of doing!
Probably a bad idea. My suggestion would be To join a study group at college to hone your skills and get a better understand other people’s ability to grasp the lessons. To be perfectly honest I’m not sure you have the depth of knowledge to teach yet. I come from a different era but it was easy to ask one of my professors a question that revealed a serious lack of depth in understanding. It could have been me or maybe she didn’t want to engage this student, either way it left me with a poor impression of her knowledge in the field. So ask yourself this do you understand the inner workings of the subjects you wish to cover? That is if someone asks how PRINT works or any of the many other elementary features a new student might use. Can you provide a rational response? 
Honestly i don't know how print works behid the scenes, but i know how to print something. Thank you for your suggestion, I'll keep that in mind. 
Have a look at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10035752/elegant-python-code-for-integer-partitioning In particular, the answer by Nico Schlömer.
You can choose exactly what panels you will see in Spyder, so how is it dense?
Would definitely recommend Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course. I'm currently on Week 9 and he's been exceptional so far. Since you've got a math background, you may find it easier than most others. I heard his deep learning specialization is great too. Also look into fast.ai?
Thanks, I'll get that fixed EDIT: fixed
Vscode is a code editor on steroids. Pycharm is a full blown IDE. I think the features that vscode will offer are a near subset of pycharm. I guess it really depends on how much of a IDE you want to have, Btw you can get pycharm professional using your student ID... Personally really like the cohesiveness and out of the box just works tendency of pycharm. Sublime text’s speed is unbeatable for fast simple editing taks.

This is probably a very simple fix, but I can't get it to run. It keeps stopping when it imports bug_palette. It says "no module named 'bug_palette'." Any ideas?
Thanks for your thoughts. I'll keep this in mind. 
Is there a possibility to use multiple pictures together to get the dominating colors of a certain set of pictures?

Remember, possibly.
I believe the Python launcher handles version management. In other words, once you install both, you can run `py -3.6` for 3.6 and `py -3.7` for 3.7.
This looks so beautiful and minimal! 
amazing work bro keep up the great work !

Why is this upvoted so much? It's an image of some lines on a black background. The only relation to python is the headline. Where is the code? Which libraries were used?
If you're still doing PHP work then you should **really** check out PhpStorm. &gt; having multiple projects open You can do this in the IntelliJ IDE family. There's just some language-specific restrictions regarding project configurations. &gt; working sets I'm not an Eclipse user but don't [scopes](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/settings-scopes.html) achieve something similar? Once you set up scopes you can select them in the project(navigation) pane, search dialogs, etc.
Keep up the good work! 
There is a sub reddit just for learning python r/learningpython, so you should ask your future questions there. &amp;#x200B; To your question, the i has (in this specific example) no use at all its just that the syntax expects you to put something in there, you might as well use \_ or any other name you want instead of it.
i is just a variable name. You could use any valid variable name. People probably use "i" as short for integer. You can read that code as "For each item in range(5): do something" You could just as easily write this: for foo in range(5): print(foo)
This question would be better in /r/learnpython The **for** loop will define **i** for each value **in** the list you input. You can print **i** in see how the value updates. **range(x)** is basically a list e.g. \[1,2,3,4,5\]. &amp;#x200B; for i in range(5): print(i) &amp;#x200B;

Uh, da sam znao prije. Sretno!
`i` is historically a short for "iterator". Don't confuse it with Python iterator, which is a bit different thing. 
It's sort of a tredition, supposedly since fortran, to use 'i', 'j' and 'k' for indexing. (I think)

Yep, that's also one of the interpretations.
Thanks a lot !! I really appreciate it 😊
Well the first thing to do is to determine how much memory your data would actually use if organized properly in memory. Then determine if it is even possible to load it all into memory on your machine. If it is then determine if you really need pandas!!! If it is possible to accomplish what you need with lower level tools and structures, give pandas the boot. Seriously consider another language that removes much of Pythons overhead. In any event what you are doing may very well play a role in how you go about solving the problem. For example can you work on the data record by record? If so load a record at a time, modify, and stream out to a second file (classic UNIX like utilities). You really haven’t said what you are doing so just realize that there are many options. 
Go ahead! You probably wont teach great Python for others but you will definitely learn a lot by trying to explain concept to others! You could also blog about problem you solve or program you write, it might be a good experience as well. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;

`for i in range(5)` translates into english as "for every value (which I will call `i`) in the result of `range(5)`". It's fairly common, although not particularly good practice, to use `i` as the loop variable here. Given that this particular `i` is not used, it should instead be `_`, which is conventional for "variable I'm going to assign but not refer to again".

I would definitely recommend Python for Everybody. It covers the fundamentals as well as more advanced concepts as you go on. https://www.py4e.com/book 
Thanks for the insight. I might just stick with PyDev for now. It sounds as if I were already using PyCharm, I'd really like it and if I were starting out, I should use PyCharm. But there is a cost to changing IDEs for a project (like changing a horse mid stream).
Yeah, you can create Django projects, but my web work is mostly REST APIs built with Bottle. Eclipse has plugins for database viewers, css/html editors, git, etc. It scratches the basic debugging itches: set a breakpoint, read the state (the variables tab in the debugger), set specific expression watches, do remote debugging, etc. What are material UIs?
Collection's? Record's? Damn, you need a linter for your grammar!
Treat it, quite literally, as learning a language. You can't learn Spanish in two weeks and then expect to have a fluent conversation with someone. Python, coding in general, is the same thing. Chip away at it everyday, revel in your small successes, and STICK WITH IT. 
The best way to learn to read others code and write your own code. If you don't understand something, immediately google it and figure it out.
actually i meant Collection/table referencing to a sql db and records is the data in collection 
I'd think about some particular thing your group has recently worked on or investigated (web scraping, for instance?) and pick a library that shows off how that can be made relatively simple. That way it's relevant to something they have some recent experience with. (PS: props for Pyglet. Love that library!)

Swift seems like a nice language. But would Swift also be suitable when I have no interest in iOS or Mac based app development at all and just want to deal with Linux systems? And how would you compare Rust to Swift or in general? Rust seems like a nice language too but it can feel quite low level at times. But it doesn't have many of the other problems of C/C++ while still being performant to a similar level.

I've been completely stumped on this for weeks, and my programmer friends can't seem to understand it either. &amp;#x200B; Essentially we're meant to get a phrase from our user (i.e. "Nice to meet you") and then a list of letters to redact (i.e. "a,e,i,o,u"). Is there anyone out there smart enough to figure this out? I'm not exactly an expert on loops yet and I can't continue my lesson without completing this.

Automate the boring stuff and Harvard's CS50 Intro to Computer Science free course helped me a ton (https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50+X/course/).

Language-specific editors offer a more customized environment. I **can** install the PHP plugin from JetBrains while using IntelliJ and I'll get full support for PHP. But the IDE will be missing some menus/panels/etc.. I'm sure there's more differences though.

Sure. But as described at [Python in RHEL 8](https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2018/11/14/python-in-rhel-8/), user-land Python will be provided via AppStreams meaning that it will be simple to install a newer version on the system. I'd hope that by the time RHEL 8 is released, there will be an app stream available for 3.7. Python 3.8 is still about [11 months from release](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0569/#schedule).
Nice how is it?
As long as you don't use it for relational data...
No, the reason is that for most what sysadmins do packaging using a system packager is the way to go. I disagree about containers vs venvs in fact I would say venvs are superior to containers. Containers in the end became over-glorified zip files. The problem was packaging of an application and proposed solution is to "let's mash the whole system together with the application". IMO the proper solution (or very close to proper) to the problem is what Nix is doing. Instead of saving the state of an application in an container it is describing how to build the application and lists all dependencies down to libc. That way you have complete description of what your application needs to run, and it is fully reproducible. You can then use nix to generate docker container (if you need it) or use it for deployment (in which case it works similar to venv except it's for everything not just python).

Yes. Have a look at their [Web API Reference](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/) if you are interested. I however used the Python wrapper [Spotipy](https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#).
Ah I was not aware of AppStreams. I guess that's an interesting way to solve problem of packaging for user applications. Will see how it will work. For python I just used IUS repo, where I could install any phone version and then create virtualenv.
My understanding is that on any one system, only one version of a particular AppStream can be installed at once. If you need both Python 3.6 and Python 3.7, that may not be possible. In that case 3rd-party repos like IUS will likely still be useful.
Pretty dificult tbh, but I'm also just an idiot so
Apple for sure. I hate having to configure all my IDE's to use a python3 command instead of regular python. It should be intuitively obvious...
On AMI Linux you just need to install python3 (if it isn't) then use `alternatives` to make it the default
Came here to say this! Trying to explain what you've learned to others is a great way to solidify your ideas and understanding. Not to mention, if you happen to really find your voice in explaining things to others and have a nice neat little tutorial set under your belt, you can point to this during your interviews later on (just make them in a professional tone). Companies looking to hire new grads are going to look for the extras like that to differentiate those that put effort into things and those that get by. Good luck!
If you could build a similar program for Facebook to manage all your Facebook content you would be very appreciated by many. Would also strike a decent blow to facebook if users started adopting it enmass.

Here is my recommendation, which I tried with a few people and seems to work reasonably well. What I like it is that you get to do fun exercise that are really not boring - and you see the immediate results of what you did as drawings. Even the mistakes may look interesting. * Go to [pythonturtle.org](https://pythonturtle.org), download the software * Read the lessons (click the "teach me" button) * Draw the following: * A square * A triangle * A grid of 2x2 (4 squares that make up a larger square) * A star of david * A circle * A square spiral * A function that receives a parameter of n and draws a grid of nxn squares * A circular spiral * A function that takes a parameter n and draws n concentric squares * A function that takes a parameter n and draws n concentric circles Now, there are more things you can try afterwards, either on an exercise plan or on your own. Regardless, feel free to respond here or to DM me if you need some help.
If they're newer I would highlight how much work you can do with minimal code and show the difference between low/high level. I would show itertools tricks, requests, web scraping, csv or json reading, and compare how much code it takes to C/C++.
Great point about interviews, having extra side project like a blog or a youtube channel about programming is always a huuuge bonus (unless you write terrible terrible things but I trust you will prepare really good)
You uninstalled Python 3.5? Why?

It works because of something called iterable unpacking. `bar, foo` creates a tuple of two items `(2, 1)`, which is then "unpacked" into the names `foo` and `bar`, which (technically) have nothing to do with their previous values. The case where the right side is "the same variables in a different order" is not in any way special - `foo, bar = [1, 2]` will work just as well, and so will `foo, bar = tuple('12')`, `foo, bar, baz = '123'` and any other expression that evaluates to an iterable.
Cool! I am not familiar with the Philips hue lights, but I definitely think that it is possible. The only thing you would have to do is to replace `led_controller.py` with another script that would connect to the hue API and set the computed color to your lights. Feel free to write to me if you have any more ideas or questions 😃
Thanks, I needed to hear this. :) 
Xwindows back to my laptop. It's an imperfect solution, but I am using one file as an example file for writing my local code, so I wanted to pull that up with idle.
this seems to be more of a advertisement than something actually related python 
Reddit limits the API and website to 1000 items. I'm not sure why you are not able to get more than 980, but you won't be able to get more than 1000. 
I see. Is there no way around this? Different library etc..
You can use https://pushshift.io/
How would you go about building something like this?What prequisites did you have to have?
Well hopefully some less known packages will make that step as well
Hi there! Can I ask you a question? I'm wanting to try using eye tracking software to keep my car's side mirrors at the correct position while I move around in the car, is that possible?
itertools
Ya just gotta build stuff.
Not an answer to your question, but why do you need readline module to get readline support. Like input() already reads lines so what is it’s purpose
What's a "sysadmin" in 2018? It's someone who manages the infrastructure at the abstract level - making sure the hosting environment stays up, making sure storage stays up, implementing/testing/executing DR and /then/ as a systems SME to assist in application deployment on that compute and storage environment. If you don't have at minimum one of either Chef, Puppet or Ansible on your resume you're not getting a sysadmin job today. Then there is the mentality of former old-school Linux sysadmins. BSD/Mac/actual UNIX sysadmins always knew the difference between `/usr/local` or `/opt/local` vs the base OS; and Jails and Solaris Zones that carry their own local trees were par for the course before everybody Dockered. It's not a new concept, so I don't know why it's still an issue. Nevertheless, the idea that the app defines the required environment is also not a new concept either, and mashing the system with the application makes deployment of the application as-written, built and tested repeatable and the outcome deterministic.
Have a look at [this](https://dordnung.de/raspberrypi-ledstrip/) guide (which helped me connect my IKEA-Dioder LED-strip to my Raspberry Pi) under the section *What is needed*. There you will find the prerequisites listed.
