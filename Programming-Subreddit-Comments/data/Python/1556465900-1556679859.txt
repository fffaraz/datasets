But didn’t you see the ALL CAPS title? The assignment is obviously due Monday and the teacher isn’t checking the forum on a Sunday!
Worst case scenario you can always reinstall Python and the packages you need
allkeys = [] for i in [roomate1,roomate2,roomate3]: allKeys.append(i.keys()) uniqueKeys = list(set(allkeys)) Then just try to pull those keys from the objects
This is not stupid at all.
Hey for 14 you’re doing great! Didn’t start coding till I was 20. Keep up the great work! You got a bright future ahead of you!
Ive been coding for something like 25 years, my favorite moments are building stuff like this... Building "useful" stuff is 90% boring and 10% interesting puzzle solving. My favorite part of any project is identifying the hard part and making a toy to learn the techniques, my second favorite part is translating the toy into the actual project. I put up with the rest because the pay is good and I get to do the fun stuff sometimes.
Can ya send me the link so I can copy it and open it from my explorer? :P
 Can you post the code?

I always say, "I'm now aware of how little I know"
It's in the post. xd
Well, pretty good I am 14 also and I have built a pretty big useless project tutorial! But still it got more than 2000 likes and 50000 views! So, no project is useless because it provides some good amount of experience! My big useless project - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mu6qlFY3x0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mu6qlFY3x0)
The job is about monitoring open processes over a period of time.
You’re 14, showing initiative to learn an important skill. We all start somewhere. Stupid is the wrong word, be proud.

thanks so kind of you
It's stuff like this that I did when I was a young the led me to a successful engineering career. Keep it up, you're doing great. (I used LOGO the original (?) Turtle graphics lol)
Thanks

I had a similar problem a few months back, maybe this will help you without rewriting everything: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34851411/graceful-shutdown-of-celery-workers https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51408605/celery-active-task-lost-on-worker-shutdown
If I understand you right, Marshmallow will help you with this: https://marshmallow.readthedocs.io/en/3.0/
[Here is my take on the problem](https://gist.github.com/tweakimp/deb42116aedc2703beef6d8d6385f6a6)
Well kinda, a hash function that can be inverted *isn't a hash function* due to them being defined as one way functions so as long as it's not that way then yeah it's possible.
Thanks for the reply, got this working. Changed the architecture to dependency injection ..once again thanks for the advice :)
Do you run API validation? Do you do regression testing?
Hey man, I’m 28 and in the process of learning Python at the moment. As you started at a similar point in your life do you have any tips for things I could work on or maybe something to work towards? Basically hoping to create a career for myself!
Studying on how to optimize an `aiohttp` application we're building at work. Our biggest concern is the data access (our mysql server is experience a degradation on performance) and we are using `SQLAlchemy`. In my list of research are: PyPy, uvloop and GINO, not to count the code optimizations.
Yeah programming obviously will be useful for that. Reverse engineering will be important for zero day, so learn assembly and tools like gdb, ollydebug and the new ghidra. Check out immersive labs for some funner stuff. Effective python by Brett slatkin is a good python book, and advanced penetration testing by Wil Allsopp are quite good along with the red team and blue team field manual. Not sure if you can use it but linuxzoo. net has a kali section we did during my masters.
What?
My goodness, I wish I’d been even a quarter this good a programmer when I was 14! Please, please don’t feel like this is “stupid” or useless in any way. Frankly, you’ve built something better than some of the “professional” programmers I’ve worked with would be capable of. Be proud! This is awesome, well done. Keep it up!!
Just saw this and no one mentioned it: you can join two Paths with "/". &gt;&gt;&gt;Path("/my/foo") / Path("bar") Path("my/foo/bar")
Pretty self explanatory really. Replaces tokens with “oooof” to decrease readability. Useful for when you want to publish a github project for people to use but you don’t want them commenting and creating pull requests because of your coding style/crappy code. “Pull request closed: my code is shit *by design*, cant you read the oooofs?”
A paint application was my first GUI too, waaaay back in the day. Yours is a lot better than mine was lol
Hey man, when I was 14 my dad tried to teach me python but since it was my dad trying to teach me, I ignored him. Now I'm a full-time python dev. The moral of the story is, learn python. Your parents may or may not be prescient, but I think almost everyone agrees programming skill will still be important a generation or two from now.
I totally get your frustration. Looking at it now, I see many things to improve, so thanks for your recommendations. I've actually planned to go to detail, and started with explaining Tkinter, then I realized that that already took a long time, almost 1/3 of the entire video length, and I had only the first line in (import Tkinter). My original goal was to be below 10 minutes and somehow manage to show the basics of creating a window and adding of some essential GUI elements, as well as creating a function to handle the click. It's not perfect, too bad I didn't check here as to what should such a video contain. Something like a brief description of geometry could be useful, I agree.
I prefer gitlab myself, my team uses it and it's a little less... owned-by-microsoft-y
I mean I did this as a middle finger to my comp sci professor, but please find practical uses for this
Why do you use Tkinter? Do you recommend another one?
Yeah man, I'm happy to help! For me, I used learning materials like books, YouTube tutorials, and online classes (Udemy, Coursera, edX) to build up skills. But the real litmus test is taking what you've learned and applying it to a personal project of your choosing. === Learning === Here are recommendations for each learning medium: [Automate the Boring Stuff w/ Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com) (ATBS book free link, pricey for print) [Sentdex YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/sentdex) [Python Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/complete-python-bootcamp/) (periodically check in for price, don't buy for more than $15) \- I started with ATBS; the explanations are easily accessible. However, the exercises can be goofy and you might not understand how valuable a lesson is based on how silly it sounds. After finishing the first 5 chapters (\~ish), you can skim through and reference sections as applicable. You don't need to know webscraping or email automation first thing, but you do want to get a solid foundation with the core data types. \- Sentdex is just amazing. He has tutorials on core data types, web development, data science topics like natural language processing, etc. etc. If you watch his stuff, make sure you're coding along with him. I've often passively watched tutorials before without coding, but the learning doesn't really happen unless you follow along. \- Udemy course is currently way over priced, but it's got some terrific nuggets in there. Focus is on core data types and practical exercises to show what they can do. === Projects === As I said, projects are the way to learn. You've gotta take what you've studied out for a test drive to prove you've really learned it. Here are some sample projects that have helped me the most: \- webscrape weather data and email the results to yourself. DM me for tips on how to accomplish this. ATBS has good introductory material, but I found another [book](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920034391.do) to help me through some of the more challenging topics. \- Use google maps API to find distance from one location to another. I saw that Built in Chicago released 2019 best places to work in Chicago, however several locations were &gt;5 mi from me. So I wrote a script that web scraped all location names, sent these google maps, found the distance from my house to each of these places, saved results in a dictionary, then rank ordered by distance. Again, DM me for help. \- Use twitter API and pyMySql to set up a database to store the results of the tweets you've collected. Perform sentiment analysis on these tweets to see which were positive vs negative. \- Build a linear programming optimization tool from scratch, using NumPy. === Summary === These projects aren't quite entry level but if you work through some of the resources I've provided, you'll be cooking with gas in literally no time at all! Again feel free to DM me for help on any of these things. I'm excited for the journey you're starting, enjoy the process :)
I've decided to use Tkinter because it's has been a default GUI library and part of Python since the year 2000 and it's a de facto standard GUI interface for Python. But you've touched on a very good point. The next video I have in mind is to show some basics of creating GUI by using QT Designer. That could be a second part to the one I just made.
This might be a rather extensive request, but which parts attain to creating the custom pattern? Only [mouse.py](https://mouse.py) and [cell.py](https://cell.py), or parts from other classes as well? I've made my own Game of Life in Python as a beginners project, but I had no idea how to make a customizable pattern so I'd like to steal that part(and learn) from you, and then see if I can Frankenstein the two together.
Dude.. stop down grading your work.. no code is stupid code.. maybe you can't code sophisticated AI algorithms.. but anyone who is judging your code knows that.. a better statement was 'hey guys i made a project that i'm proud of, any tips'.. everyone started from print('Hello World!').. i wish u success and happiness buddy.. be proud of any work you do.. even if it's simple it's progress toward your goals.. :D
I'm in.
Great job. Keep doing it. Don't ever think it is stupid or lame, or let anyone tell you so. You are already ahead of lots of humans. And, if you want to be great coder, you still need to start somewhere - first programs will rarely be great. Mine were much worse than yours ;) Also, this is a good start, especially that it is at 14. I wish my kids will do the same one day. If you stay hungry for new knowledge and stuff, you'll move ahead much faster than your peers, if you multiply that by the years you have ahead of you, it is nowhere near of stupid. Could this app be better? For sure. So what? I guess it served its purpose - for you to learn something. Now go and find another nice concept and do as you think it should be done. Small tip for getting more experience: try to get some app all the way to the real user. Like small game, or utility app, just anything - get it into some store, to the point where people could download it, use it, and eventually pay for it. You probably wont get any good money (at start) - though that $15 made out of it will make you super proud, I guess ;) But the real reason for this exercise is that it takes a lot of specific skills to actually ship an app to the end user. Your 20 or 30 yr old self will thank you for learning those skills.
So use cpickle.
I personally like Sublime Text 3
Nice, thank!
Wow thanks so much for taking the time to describe all this for me. I actually did buy a Udemy course a couple of months ago and am working through it. I definitely feel like i’m learning a lot (although i think i’ll need to go back through it) but I’ve been wanting to try and find some personal projects to also get me going. I’ll definitely check out the Sentdex YouTube, it sounds like a great resource. The projects you’ve described sound amazing - although maybe a little out of my league at the moment - and I’d really love to have a go at these. I researched API’s not long ago (because I feel like there could be countless cool projects using them) but I didn’t have a clue what I was reading! Thanks again for this!
As a newbie I wonder the same thing sometimes, running files that are saved on my computer.
Hey my first app was made in paint, I did it grab a grasp of how things went together, at 14 you seem to have a better understanding than a lot of people I know that are learning, good luck on your journey
hi just 14 i am guys you should learn how to punctuate your sentences with commas and periods to appear smarter you dont actually have to be smarter its really easy you could probably find a quick tutorial on youtube
That’s jumping from one thing to another. The racist part is for comedic effect but the underlying point still stands. We aren’t smacking people around with clubs anymore we use guns instead both of them are bad but that isn’t the point. The point is that we move on to newer things because the older things aren’t as good. Like python 2. It’s terrible. Python 3 is newer and better it doesn’t make sense to stay on a slowly more obsolete language.
I was gonna recommend running as pyw but nvm..
You can use ord to convert a character to an int. Do some manipulation on the result and then use chr to convert back to a string? Is that along the right lines?
Thank you! This was a huge help!
You can't dynamically create variables. Try the exec() function. It takes whatever is in the string you give it and runs it like code. Ex: exec("print("hi")") will print hi.
Sure you can. You can just manipulate the current `__dict__` and put in whatever variables you want. If you're in a class instance, you can use `setattr` too
You can dynamically store variables, not create them.
That isn’t what the OP is asking about — they’re looking for **ord** and **chr** — but also you _can_ dynamically create variables, using **exec**: exec("a = 12") print(a) Though the number of cases in which you _should_ do so is perilously small, and virtually never intersects with the number of cases in which someone _thinks_ they should.
Ok; oof oof (oof: oof) { oof oof(“oof”).oof() } oof() Mic drop.
Wow the post title is literally r/circlejerk
&gt;Yes, even as a life long vi(m) user I find that for development you can't beat a good IDE like PyCharm. It even has a somewhat decent vim mode.
This doesn't have to do with Python, but rather your editor. Please check the documentation for your text editor.
That's awesome! Do you happen to have a GitHub repository for this project? Thanks 🎊🎉
Same algorithm used by one company and another will give you same output. Therefore if you have 'Passw0rd' in Facebook and Twitter encoded with same algorithm, in both cases, hash would be for it i.e. D63AF63C To make the output unique, a 'salt' is used - a small string added before/after your password which makes hash different for each website/company. Basically their salt + your password = their unique hash This makes it harder to use something called 'rainbow tables' and find what the password was by searching a list of precompiled hashes for the most popular passwords.
I don't right now. It was a project for my scholarship il put it up in a bit.
This isn't stupid, this is rad
Isn't regression testing just running a subset of the tests related to the area you changed and some high risk tests? If so, you'd only do that if your test suite takes a long time. Simple problems that you know are right let you catch regressions in your own software as well as your dependencies. Numpy and scipy are very good libraries, but are not immune to regressions. Thankfully, it's pretty obvious when the only thing that changed was scipy. API testing should probably all be unit tests. I think you're mixing up unit tests (small tests that are easily checked) with what they are checking. That part is sort of irrelevant.
Keep learning, it will take you far.
But it looks like some kind of auto completion/suggestion function. It can probably be disabled...
damn nice job you guys are younger than me but your work is better than mine XD
Django is more designed for relational databases. If you want to use MongoDB then I'd suggest Flask.
I'm sure yours is great iv been doing this for like 5 years at this point.
Very good. Keep up the good work. :)
Good stuff. Keep up the good work :)
Maybe I'm misunderstanding, but you can have a module *without* an `a` variable. If I run locals()['a'] = 123 My module will now have an `a` variable. I view that as creation. Unless we're just referring to that same thing, but calling it something different ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
oh wow, just watched a battle, MicroMachine vs Tychus... pretty damn impressive. This looks awesome, might have to give it a try.
Certs are useless, and if an application of someone who wanted a Python job came across my desk, I'd first look for background in coding, then for any projects that demonstrated if they had proficiency. I wouldn't even look at the certificate at all.
I've seen this (nearly) exact video before... After some digging [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/afo1zr/i_made_a_car_that_is_controlled_by_a_wii_remote/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/b0r2tg/i_made_a_car_that_drives_with_a_wii_remote_for_a/). Nice upgrade! Did you use infrared sensors to detect object?
Nope an ultrasonic sensor but thanks for the support. Iv learned alot from this project.
So rather than fix your crappy code / coding style, you did this? I'm sure you'll be a real asset to whatever poor dev team ends up hiring you.
If I were you, I would program the do not disturb mode on for when you sleep. Do not get up in the night because your phone notifies you of something, value your sleep more than that. On android at least, its very easy to do.
When your code executes, it will search the current directory for any input/output behavior, unless you've specified something else. Just keep the files you want to read/write in the same directory as your script, for simplicity's sake. You can read/write from/to wherever you want, but this approach is simple and will work fine (unless your assignment/goal requires something different). Does that help?
Your instructor will navigate to wherever the submitted assignments folder is on their computer and execute the program from there
But you can't have different voices....
I see your Wii-mote but I bring you my [xbox controlled esp8266](https://github.com/nathanRamaNoodles/Tinker-Controller/tree/master/Arduino/Projects/Tinker%20Car)
The sooner someone starts programming, the better You are on the very right track. You'll be a beast before you graduate high school but watch out to keep this pace up! If you don't have a [GitHub](https://www.github.com) account, go and make one. Upload all your projects there while you develop them (if you dont already know it, then learn it, it is essential). when ur 20, you will be grateful you have a gitHub account full of projects. It will show that you are competitive in the market! &amp;#x200B; Good Luck!
At first I was thinking 14 is pretty young to start coding, but then I remembered that I also started around that age (21 currently). As long as you're having fun coding, keep at it. I learned a ton because of how fun I found coding and how curious I was about how everything worked. You'll do great if you keep at it
I'm interested in learning kivy. Do you use it?
I have one of them it looks really cool.
Yah just pip freeze do you have all your current dependencys just make sure to manually pip install this one later instead of the requirements.txt way
No one solves problems in competetitive programming in python, because it is slow as hell (20 times slower than C++) There are [codeforces](https://codeforces.com) with real problems from past competitions (it supports python btw)
this is better than and has more real world application than anything I coded with Python my first two years at college you should honestly feel proud of yourself and continue to develop, imagine how good you could be at 22, you'll have a great job one day too if you evolve your skills honestly, be proud of yourself, I'm proud of your and don't even know you
I have been working on creating an air hockey robot for the St. Louis Science Center. The specific project is implementing a Reinforcement Learning strategy to play against others. Just finished having the training simulator play against itself. This is a huge project overall, and I am just tackling the reinforcement learning part of it. This is the [repo](https://github.com/Positronic-IO/air-hockey-training-environment/tree/develop).
You’re doing great! Running laps around me!
I know the people in these comments are trying to keep you positive, but it's a pretty dumb application, but that's okay. Making useless or dumb stuff is fine, as long as you are learning and enjoying it. I love making dumb scripts that just serve my enjoyment and nobody else's. Good luck with future dumb applications!
Started programming when I was 11 on Khan Academy, am now 16 and do game programming in C++. Keep up the work, odds are you will progress faster than I did cause your brain is more developed now then mine was when I started lol. Glad to see other young people programming
oh well nice :P did you learn it from the internet or at your school cause I'm trying to learn how to make things with raspberry pi but I can't find a good tutorial
Internet if you need any help just pm me.
Just curious as someone with a 'tech' background wanting to do development rather than current job, what type of projects are most applicable? I would expect web stuff like with flask/Django, or something 'data science'-y, but anything else?
Libtcod
I'm 19, started coding 1.5month ago, honey by the time you're 19 you will be a developer already employed
[Twine](https://twinery.org) might work well. It's not python, but you should be able to read the HTML and whatever else it generates with python.
Isn't that a c++ library? I believe python-tcod is the latest python port.
Kaggle, if you're doing deep learning. Pytorch or tensorflow 2.0 are needed though.
Make the class variables iterable somehow and use for loops when asking for the variables and writing them?
In order to write to separate lines, you need a newline character at the end of your call to `.write`. Like this: `file.write(personal_info.fname + "\n")` In terms of simplifying the code, it depends on what you want to do with it. Here's one example, using a for-loop: file = open("testfile.txt", "w") fields = ["first name", "last name", "middle name", "age", "height", "weight"] for field in fields: field_value = input(field) file.write(field_value + "\n") file.close()
Huh. I've never used pysimplegui. Why would I want to use that for games over something like kivy that does guis in the window instead of guis that contain the window? Or is pygame here being used for something other than games?
Once you learn code, you can learn much more, and get impressive jobs when you're old enough, that is if theres even an age limit to jobs...
lul.
Yes, the python binding lib name always eludes me, at one point I've used tdl then it was tcod again.
tl;dr: Use dependency injection. But "dependency injection" is a scary term from the world of java and DI frameworks, so don't say that you're using it.
I'll do my best to explain it without going to in-depth, but here I go. The Cell object is a stand alone cell which holds attributes and methods for saying the cell is highlighted, alive, or dead and where that cell belongs on the grid using the pygame.Rect object. The Mouse object is hacked together to do all the repitive code I would have had to write up. The main key is knowing where the Mouse.position is and whether or not its position is within the bounds of the Cell object. I originally wanted to avoid creating a grid, but ended up having to do it anyways because I didn't like the idea of that code being in other parts according to how the game creates those objects, updates them, and then draws them to the screen. I ended up making a Grid object anyways because it made my life easier in the long run by allowing me to access the Cell objects which are globally stored in the pygame.sprite.Groups object. I learned how to do all of this following the kidscancode pygame tutorial series on youtube and watched a bunch of videos on youtube about Conways Game of Life and then read a bunch of articles and got the base rules, algorithms, and extensions from Wikipedia. The rest I either asked for help or hacked up my self. A lot of the structure of the code is based on the style I got from kidscancode. I took what I needed, dumped the rest, and worked from there. The first step is getting the Cells and Grid setup. The seconds step is getting the Cell to recognize that the mouse is "hovering" over it so that it becomes active. My advice would be to play with the Cells, Grid, and Mouse objects first and seeing how they all work together to get the basics. That's actually how I started. I wasn't originally going to share my code, but decided to only after I got stuck on "the neighbour problem" as I like to call it which is just getting a Cell object to recognize whether or not a live Cell is directly adjacent to it. Hope this helps and best of luck!
Apologies, I just saw this. I do the works. Query data, clean it, glean insights, and present reports. Python turns a week's worth of *my* prescribed tasks into an hour. That's a special case though, since my particular employer doesn't utilize any BI tools and thus it's carte blanche to reinvent the wheel so to speak. Having access to a large, diverse dataset with which to teach myself pythonic ways of data analysis has been extremely helpful in my journey.
Interesting, I never really considered the idea of a python (programming) certification. There are relevant networking and system administration certifications out there, but I haven't heard about any programming-themed ones. Will check back to this post if anyone replies with anything.

Thanks a bunch for your time, man. Il'll give it a go, I may come back with a question or two though. This will require quite the rewrite. I've looked for the Game of Life tutorials on the youtube channel you mentioned, but they seem to have been since removed.
This isn’t really “cracking” per se. it’s using a lookup (rainbow) table containing a map of commonly used passwords and their corresponding hashes. The logic behind everything is to take an input in the form of MD5, SHA1, or SHA256, then search the rainbow table for that key and return it’s value. If this were truly “cracking” hashes it would mean that hashes would have to be procedurally generated from every letter combination possible until the user-provided hash matches said generated hash. Even with MD5, that method proves not to be 100% accurate in that there are a ton of known collisions, i.e. two plaintext values having the same MD5 hash.
It's a joke fren. You're not actually supposed to use this professionally.
Holly cow! Nice work. You know there would be a big market for remote control cars that don't bang up you trim and cabinets. Just saying as a parent I would buy the obstacle avoidance model over the regular every day.
This actually isn’t using rainbow tables. Rainbows are precomputed lists of hashes from other wordlists. And that’s also wrong. That’s using a brute-force attack, mine uses a dictionary attack. They are both ways of “cracking” hashes or passwords.
To be honest it wouldn't be hard for manufacturers to put it into their products if I can do it they can. It would be cool to see this become standard.
In this case, for PyGame, PySimpleGUI is more of an augmentation. It's a way of having a larger GUI with more widgets. It's another option is how I look at it. Another library that PySimpleGUI integrates with, like OpenCV, and more recently pymunk. It's for those situations where people ask for a GUI on top of what PyGame provides.
See if it's possible to patent. (Probably not, but worth a shot). If you can Paton it sell it to all the big manufacturers.
Congratulation
I highly highly doubt it but il Google it. Again I'm only 25 so I'm not sure how easy it would be.
if goingToCrash: dont()
I mean aside from variable names that's what it looks like.
these kids are coming to take our jobs
Python Objects are not serializable, you'll have to do the mapping to a \`dict\` manually. I had this problem in my application because we need business classes to have an abstraction from the database model, we had to map from an incoming JSON, we had to do everything manually.
Youv got a few years.
No problem. I couldn't find a "clean" tutorial with an OOP approach for pygame, but I learned how to do it using the [pygame tutorial by kidscancode](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsk-HSGFjnaH5yghzu7PcOzm9NhsW0Urw). It took me awhile before I finished going through it, but I learned **alot** from that series. The videos I saw about the Game of Life were on channels like numberphile and stuff like that. They were mainly generic videos covering the ideas and concepts behind it. [Stephen Hawkings The Meaning of Life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgOcEZinQ2I) [An introduction to Conways Game of Life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouipbDkwHWA&amp;t=2s) [Inventing Conways Game of Life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9Plq-D1gEk) The rest weren't really helpful and used 3rd party libraries with a limited trial license or showed you how they went about the process. I really didn't like them TBH. The rules I based my code on were literally pulled straight from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life). The rest was just patience and determination simply because a lot of the examples online were dead links or I just really didn't like the approach they took. The other sources I found were all prebuilt full on licensed programs without source code or written in a different language using some other library. I just wanted to make something from scratch using pygame and so that's what I've been doing. I'm still working on it and I won't consider this project finished until you can play, pause, save, load, reset, and scale. The scaling I'm leaving for last, but we'll see what happens. Last, but not least... Feel free to ask me any questions. I really don't mind. You can always make an issue on my repo and we can discuss whatever there if this thread gets to big. I know reddit also has a chat system.
Oh nice. I might use pysimplegui for my opencv tensor thing then.
this is with python?
Lots of goodness today!! keep that up! &amp;#x200B; is it only Arduino or did you use a Raspberry Pi? any reference if someone wants to make similar stuff? (I am a Python trainer for kids. I guess it would be cool if I teach Python through Raspberry Pi or Arduino)
I actually solved it with Marshmallow, thank you!
&gt; we had to map from an incoming JSON, we had to do everything manually. Marshmallow is actually pretty useful, maybe that could help you in the future too? https://marshmallow.readthedocs.io/en/3.0/
Mario cart real life version
So are you 25 or 15 (cuz that's what it says in the title)?
We use Marshmallow as data validation, and after that we need to map to another object who can't be tied to the API contract nor the database model.
Great project! Thank you. Just converted it for Python 2.7/PySide and Python 3/PySide2 and it works fine..
I did a project like at school with a controller, but a wiimote that crazy dude !
Launching programs is easy. Resizing and positioning should be easy, but depends on your window manager. It sounds like you're on one of the Windows releases, and I don't know about window management for those. Read the side bar, post in the appropriate subreddit, ask more specific questions, and include more info about your environment.
Ok so I fixed it. But just incase someone in the future has the same issue: 1) When I uninstalled PyObjC and re-installed it, I had installed a newer version of PyObjC than what I previously had. 2) Pyglet was searching for the old version of PyObjC but couldn't find it and was defaulting to some weird system it has predefined 3) Just change where Pyglet was looking for the old version of PyObjC to where the new install was &amp;#x200B; That took me a good couple hours to figure out. I'm sad now
Nice! I was 15 when I started to program. Starting early is great!
Holy crap. Just started out with python around a month ago and haven't done too much with it yet but it's cool to see what it can do.
cut him some slack dude. hes only 35
You should be proud of yourself - this is where it starts! Keep it up!
Yea jeez, he's only 45
It’s probably more about minimizing cost than difficulty.
Maybe implement the VASE autoencoder and have it be pip installable. I'm going to try doing that, but I don't have as much time to focus on it. If you do this one though, I'll probably have a bunch of pull requests to add.
I am 36 and I just start learning python a few months ago. I wish I would have started programming at 14. Keep it up man
I started coding in C++ over 10 years ago at about 14, and I probably couldn't have made anything like this yet at the time. Be proud of it and keep going, you'll be glad you did later.
I spent today learning pandas and I'm sure I can accomplish my task in 2-3 lines of code, havn't attempted yet. However I still wanted to solve the problem with built in functions so here it is: *with open*('example.txt', 'r') *as* f: *for* line *in* f: vars = line.rstrip('\\n').replace(' ', '').split('?') # lines in txt were different data structures, each seperated by '?'s Object(var0=vars\[0\], var1=vars\[1\], var2=vars\[2\]) # Create an instance hope that makes sense to anyone looking for an answer
You should ask here r/learnpython

thank you, done.

I've been working on this stuff for 25 years and my robot doesn't even move yet. How do I get started?
One of my favorite lakes. And it's a nice drive out there from Heber.
I removed the submission. I made the submission to help people...
At least at the PyCons I've been too, it's just everything in a gigantic room, so there is not much difference. If it's your first PyCon get some spare room in your bag for the swag, and don't be shy in trying to approach groups and introduce yourself. &amp;#x200B; I'm not sure when you would be here, but if you are around thursday I would strongly suggest bag-stuffing ([https://us.pycon.org/2019/about/volunteers/](https://us.pycon.org/2019/about/volunteers/)). It is a great way to get some physical activity and meet people.
:D Nice Job! &amp;#x200B; I created something similar to this ( Not as pretty on the user interface though) but what it did was connect to my emails and read them out loud when I receive them. &amp;#x200B; I didn't like constantly checking my emails and miss out on more programming :P
You should ask in /r/learnpython.
Advice: ask in /r/learnpython.
What is the assignment actually asking for? What does 'them both' refer too? Are you sure that you have access to grep on the other system? You might be able to write everything in python using the re module a call to the `open` function (preferably with a context manager) to write out the result to a file. Thus avoiding the use of grep or other external programs.

I coded AES when studying cryptography back in the days so I know it is not easy to crack any of those mentioned algo. Title should have been 'i wrote a hash guessing program.' Cracked for many means broken. But you didn't really broke it.. No offense.
Have you figured it out yet?
Before I knew how npm was organized I always felt it was a bit skeezy. Then I started hearing about layoffs and thought, "What the heck number of employees do they have that they can have any layoffs?" I suspect npm follows the same formula as many: Good thing for the world+MBA=Skeezy
Very cool. What equipment and libraries were used? Raspberry Pi + python? I didn't think Rpi could handle motors
What the h is this MM they are using behind each $ amount?
Damn i find it little hard to code in c++ compared to python
Thanks !!
It is short for "million", from the European tradition that "M" is often short for thousand (1000) from the Latin "mille" (e.g. millipede). So "MM" would be 1000 * 1000 = millions.
/r/learnpython /r/mysql
M is the Roman numeral for 1000. MM means a thousand thousand, or a million.
oh ok that sounds good! I'll try that!
true, but I cannot install something like anaconda to begin with.
“Hello world” would be the classic first program in any language I’d think.
For this kind of data a *graph database* like Neo4j could be the better option. Just have a look at their tutorials and demos.
The dude’s 55 calm down Jesus Christ
Well, in Roman, MM would mean 2000. MM meaning million is a modern abomination.
I have programmed some boards and I have to say, that's really a nice work.

This is amazing. Don't think you have to hide behind your age. Talent is talent.
Not to put a damper on your project, but can't this already be done with pickles?
Second this. This is so so true. Keep up at it OP! You'll possibly find these early excursions to be very very handy!
are you sharing this anywhere?
Are you using a raspberry pi or an arduino?
It's also harder to sell you another one if you didn't accidentally break the original when it crashed into a table leg ... ;-)
You da best
My first comment has a link to the github repo
This is my first Project so if you all have tips and tricks that would be lovely!
Feels bad
Hopping onto this post to say we've been using Fuzzle in our Discord bot Melon, who is basically a walking utility knowledge database. The searches really are accurate and fast, I think Dan6erbond created a gold mine with this.
I've noticed that I need to reinstall these libraries every time I start a new session. At least it still works.
Try rock scissors papers
Please, please, please put up a Github repository for this ! This is amazing !
Oh man I'm 15 the 2 and the 1 are close together.
Nice! It's a good start into control and automation engineering. Interfacing new hardware to your microprocessor/microcontroller is the first and the most important thing to learn. Enjoy these moments of truth, when you successfully test a piece of code. Welcome to the brave New world! No worries for my generation, for new blood eventually replaces the old. Just like we did. This is cycle of life. Also, we aren't exactly writing if going_to_collide(): dont() at the moment in our jobs right now. That's where we started. ;)
I'm not exactly new to it but thanks for the advice. I learnt oop recently and it's soo much better than functional programming.
There really isn't much difficulty in reading either ultrasonic rangefinders or infrared sensor input and making a motor react to it (for a manufacturer, not a 15 year old working on his project)
no single programming paradigm is answer to all problems, as each paradigm has it's use-cases. so polish your skills with paradigms and design patterns. keep looking for these small projects to work on. good luck!
Downvoters don't understand what this reddit is fir. From the sidebar: &gt; If you are about to ask a "how do I do this in python" question, please try r/learnpython, the Python discord, or the #python IRC channel on FreeNode.
I'd personally recommend using C. C is so much better for robotics for quite a few reasons
Regarding your power issues - is it possible for you to run a headless setup? I found better performance from my Pi 2B by using SSH to log into the Pi remotely. This way, your main computer can supply power to the keyboard/mouse and your Pi need only supply a wi-fi adapter. If this is not what you want to do, then perhaps invest in a separately powered USB hub? That should be able to provide the power needed to the peripherals you are using.
https://www.instadp.com have you seen this? Dont know how they got this but they got a higher resolution
the next step: make a drawing game that can be played multiplayer.

&gt;(I am a Python trainer for kids. I guess it would be cool if I teach Python through Raspberry Pi or Arduino) The RasPi has some nice-and-simple GPIO modules to tweak voltages on the built-in GPIO pins (which are then connected to a breadboard via a ribbon cable). It really lowers the bar for entry. Also, the book "Raspberry Pi for the Evil Genius" has a few good projects in it for tying everything together. I bought a copy, but you can find the PDF online, easily enoigh.
Thanks for the info. Guess who wasted his time lol I don't show any ad, though
Thanks
Yup python on a pi and then c++ on an arduino.
Thanks for idea
Iv been doing it for 5 years semi successfully.
One thing il add is that for motors it wasn't the best for me as it was only 3.3v instead of the arduino's 5v.
There are libraries / modules for "everything" ... if you can't find it, chances are you're just not looking hard enough.
That doesn't make sense, no European (and so an Earthling too) would ever ever think of M as anything other than Mega and/or million. That is set in stone.
Hah. It's so closed. What are you interested in? Try it get in python. It's may be web-scrapping (beautiful soup, selenium), frontend&amp;backend for web (flask, Django), machine learning (sklearn, tensorflow)... More ways!
Wow, yeah I tested it and the service runs from C:/WINDOWS/SYSTEM32 Or it pretends the file aka os.path.dirname(os.path.realpath(\_\_file\_\_)) is in C:/WINDOWS/SYSTEM32. How do I get the location of the REAL FILE though? Maybe access the registry key? But does this require permissions? When I start the service it isn't seemed to be allowed to write to system32.
Great point.
Love it, but how in the hell do you pronounce it?
Thanks! That is a cracking question... I guess "sequel" but with sim instead of se - simquel?
Simquel it is then :)
Hey I have participate in quite a few contest from https://www.isograd.com/FR/solutionconcours.php The site is in french, but the problems all have an english version. You can usualy see a solution from peoples that validated it during the contest by language, so if someone did it in python, you'll have a solution (quite common imho). I myself do these contest in python without any problem. All competition site do not put high constraint on time-computation and use it as score, such as the one above. It's kind of: if c++ takes 0.06s and python 0.25s, it doesn't care as both are below ~0.5s, you'll pass as it means you have used the correct algorithm and not a naive one. Also, with using the right lib you often can be close enough to c++ perf using python (say 0.08 to 0.09s in the above example), but that require a good knowledge of python internals (people often don't know much of itertools for example) or high level libs (like numpy).
Hmm... It's not easy and i don't know how comfortable graph database for store another data. When I scraped vk.com (like Facebook, but for Russian) I created table in SQLite user_friends with structure user_id - user_frend_id. And if user A is frend user B I saved line like as id123 - id231. I did not try to optimize the code because I didn’t have too many users (140к in user_info and 140*const_friends*1000 in user_friends). It's worked and it's easy.
Have you tried turning it off and on again?
i dont think it was a waste of time ;) also the instagram prrivate api is versy interesting and sth i was looking for. And if your are looking for some instagram tools take a look on this website [http://zasasa.com/en/](http://zasasa.com/en/)
And I hear, what real big company with real big user (millions users) store data in self format like a json or use postgres.
I ... think you totally mis-read my comment! :-D
It doesn't move until it gets crash avoidance. To avoid crashing, it needs to move.
What do you like? Music, finance, sports? I find that a project aligned with interests is a good motivator. Something repetitive that you do in regards to information around your interests can probably be automated.
I think you need to read your comment again.
Probably something like [PySDL2](https://pypi.org/project/PySDL2/) and [ModernGL](https://github.com/moderngl/moderngl).
Thank you, I wll try them.
This cracked me up
1. /r/learnpython 2. Your computer can't resolve `apiopenweathermap.org`, probably because that domain doesn't exist and you want `api.openweathermap.org`. 3. Requests has better ways to pass in query string parameters.
Lol. Didnt realise there is a '.'... thanks haha.
I don’t think the language matters too much, I suppose the language choice would depend on the hardware and micro controllers. I say this because if move to C then why not use Assembler? That is more direct and there is no extra overhead but I do get your point.

You can’t patent something you’ve just shown everyone on a public website. Once you disclose an invention publicly it becomes “unpatentable”.
I use edabit to practice skills, but as far as projects, try writing a simple script and hosting it on a webpage. Just did that recently lol pain in the ass but I learned some good skills
The problem I see is that if one of them fails unexpectedly then the lock will halt infinitely the other process, as I read fcntl takes care of this problem.But are there any other quirks that I missed ?

My initial plan was to store the usernames of the user's friends in a string, separated by commas, and I'll just parse the string when I need something.
I'm trying to make a game in which the player must answer a question and then moves forwards or backwards depending on right or wrong answer. The problem is making the player move from point to point towards the center of the "maze" (spiral with 90 degrees corners). Any thought on how I can make this happen?

After a small amount of research I do to think you are correct. While it's a bad idea to post them on a public forum it does not make the item unpatentable. But you have to Remember that the patent system is a first to file system. So, putting it online means that someone could patent the idea before you. Also, after looking. A patent probably isn't worth it for OP. It takes around 2 years and $10,000 to get one.

dam kids! taking our jerbs! build the kiddie fence! ok.... sry....
Okay you've got a few different components in your project. For the web framework if you're completely new to web dev I would suggest that you pick Flask over Django as it'd be both easier for you to jump into and also it's somewhat less abstract than Django which would let you know what's going on in a better way. One of the best sources to get started with Flask is [Miguel Grinberg's excellent Mega Tutorial series](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world). As far as connecting with the FB APIs go, you need to create a an app on Facebook's developer site and then you can refer to the documentations for using the API on that site itself. There are also some good Python wrapper libraries around the FB API which can be more convenient to use in many cases. But you'd still need to create an app on their developer site and obtain certain credentials such as the app id, authentication token etc. and to set up callback URLs and stuff if you find yourself needing them. I hope this helps!
Anything goes for toy projects. If you are shipping a commercial python game and not using RenPy, ask yourself why.
RenPy uses python 2.7 which is really close to being deprecated and isn't working well on my version of ubuntu (18.04). Unity is a bit overkill for a 2D game, and I don't know C# that well, so I'd have to add on the cost of a whole other language. Maybe cocos2D, since it's in both C++ and Python, but I thinking of just using nuitka with standard python, and possibly getting something closer to a C++ level game.
Really? It shouldn't need admin privileges because it's entirely in your userspace.
How many clients do you have? It would probably be more cost effective to use one of the many services that does.. extactly what you describe.. than to do it in house.
This is essentially what all AI is :D
Kick it
I saw [this article](https://medium.com/@awildtaber/building-a-rendering-engine-in-tensorflow-262438b2e062) about how to build a rendering engine in tensorflow, but I didn't find any easy to use libraries for it. So I made a PyTorch version.
I assume this is how those rumbas work too no?
Also have a look at esp8266 boards from aliexpress. A nodemcu v2 board usually cost 2-3 dollar and can run micropython.
yes it helps, ive done all of that, my problem is this: I dont know how to display the data in a non-json format to the user. i want to grab the Facebook Data (i.e. Campaign stats, CPM, clicks, reach, etc.) and then display this in graphs, sheets, etc.
I just released version [3.4.0](https://pypi.org/project/mlconjug/) of mlconjug and it fixes the bug you reported. I also added a helper method .iterate() to allow for quickly iterating over all conjugated forms. Thanks for letting me know. &amp;#x200B; Cheers.
I agree with you. Although my vision is to offer this service as well. I would love to offer a simple product to my clients and others a very easy dashboard. Also, i do a lot of analysis work for them which id like to display as well
I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit: - [/r/linguistics] [MLConjug.

I say C because the large amount of library support
Okay so you can either directly make AJAX requests from the Javascript on your page to the FB API (if it is viable security-wise then it would be preferable) or you can use your server as the intermediate layer communicating on behalf of the client to the FB API and giving the results back to the client. Now, once you have the json data from the FB API to your client's script you can use some Javascript library like **d3.js** or **highcharts**. You can feed the json data to one of these libraries and use the functionalities they provide to plot visualizations on your page.
that was tough to look at
Now I'm not saying that this isn't interesting, but it's really not related to Python in any way. You should post it in /r/MachineLearning and affiliated subreddits.
It is implemented by python
1. /r/learnpython 2. You probably ffmpeg for this, since WebM is a video format, not an image format.
Yeah, that’s why I do agree with you in general. When I started with robotics years ago, I used a language similar to Lisp and it was for a robotic arm. Our instructor had us create sandwiches. It was fun.
I understand, but it could be implemented in a number of languages and this isn't "News about the dynamic, interpreted, interactive, object-oriented, extensible programming language Python".
i automated a daily scrapy task last week. so outside of my workload i was going to setup a schedule for it.
I have not.
From a commercial standpoint (because nothing matters for a toy game): Cocos2d is a useful framework. It'll be OK if your game is highly custom or very simple. Commercially speaking only the first is relevant. An engine like Godot or Unity isn't overkill and has additional benefits in its ecosystem (art assets and community). Unity doesn't yet have native 2d support, so I'd recommend Godot. They have Python bindings and deploy to Windows, console and mobile (the 3 commercially useful game platforms). Python 2 works just fine in Ubuntu. Normally I wouldn't recommend starting a new project in Python 2 but if you're writing the kind of game that RenPy supports, it just does it out of the box. I lost count of how many RenPy games are on Steam already.
we cannot see
Why did you remove it?
My impression is that this isn't used for the sake of the standard European. It's used primarily in financial sectors or when speaking about corporate finances.
Even though it's text based, have you thought of adding a GUI? Then your inputs can be button reads rather than input statements.
Hi, thanks, do you have any plans for other languages? Ukrainian in particular? (AFAIK, there are some lemmatizers for it, probably FOSS).
if(goingtocrash()): dontCrash()
For an old-school programmer, like me, coming to Python from older lower-level languages, like Assembly or C, it takes awhile to get used to the idea that Python already has a better implementation of this built right into the language. I'm still amazed and delighted every time I write a Python program and realize how much time I saved by not needing to re-implement low-level details like linked lists, and Binary Search. ([xkcd](https://www.xkcd.com/353/))
there’s nothing more i wish than that i had started to code at a younger age. keep your mind interested to learning new things, and you will keep going far!

Hi, &amp;#x200B; Yes I am planning to add Polish, German, Dutch, Finnish and Estonian in the next release (it should be during the month of May). &amp;#x200B; I did not yet investigate Ukrainian or Russian yet, but as I have already a pretty good Polish conjugation model (I still need to tweak it a bit) which is also a Slavic language, I should be able to implement a Ukrainian model in June or so. &amp;#x200B; If you know some resources on Ukrainian conjugation (in English if possible lol :) ), I can take a look at them and maybe implement a Ukrainian conjugation model sooner. &amp;#x200B; Cheers.

I hope Dustin's right that PyPI-as-a-Service could make a lot of money, because [I built it](https://pydist.com). I certainly don't think there's enough money in it for a VC-backed company, but for a one-man gig I think there could be.

yes. This is probably best asked in /r/learningpython
Thank you, as you add Polish you will be able to handle with both Ua and Ru :) Well, I'll try to find something for you. I do tutor Ukrainian (and Russian) for non-natives, but there was a focus on entirely Ukrainian (Ru) content to avoid any translation. I might add a bit about Polish, but I learned it not so much.

What is *not easy*? Neo4j as a whole? Cipher as query language? Using a graph DB for a social platform? Imho it is much easier for such a platform than a dB with static schemas. You can much easier create new types of data and connect them *explictly* with your old data. You can easier attach completely different things to an user. And finding / proposing or showing friends of friends is way more elegant than with SQL-92. (of course modern SQL has also better support for the latter)
Check out Artifactory from jfrog (but it’s more enterprise solution)
This is what I used too. Was super helpful to get to know the basics of Python.
Or maybe SimCool
While I love python, it is a bad language for writing such tool. Password cracking is a CPU intensive operation, Python is not only a dynamic language (which has lower execution speed due to runtime checks) but also can't efficiently use all of its cores due to GIL. It might be good tool to write for practice, but password cracking by itself is not that terribly complicated. Assuming there's no vulnerability in hashing you just either compute hash of every word in password dictionary and compare against it or try brute force attack which is computing hash for any letter combination i.e. "a", "aa", "ab", "ac" ... "ba", "bb" etc.

By setting `Dv` equal to `Dv[J]`, the variable is assigned to the number stored in that list. The next time the loop body is executed, it will try to do the same thing again, only this time `Dv` is a number, and it will fail. The error message 'not susbcriptable' means that the object (the value of `Dv` doesn't support `[...]` i.e it's not a list / tuple / dict /....
/r/learnpython
as you've been told by the bot before, this kind of post is better suited for /r/learnpython
I suggest using PyCharm as your editor. It will warn you about these things.
Wait... seriously? This is amazing.
This sounds really cool. Was this your idea?
Dude, I'm not talking about anything else than "from the European tradition that "M" is often short for thousand (1000) from the Latin "mille" (e.g. millipede)." and I apologize I didn't quote that part in my initial comment: M isn't any kind of "often short for thousand". M IS ACTUALLY THOUSAND, but in a numeral system we've abandoned completely after we had a transitional period when we used them to represent dates. MM is a f\*\*\*\*\* convention among structures you both mentioned, but the origin for that has had nothing with Europe. Nothing.

I am building a large mining energy reporting system using electrical 30 minute values.. I build a small web service to query the db with some Rest commands to do some work on a pandas data frame eg mean, sum etc before it is returned as json Some processing and plot creation and then create a html file with some company styling via css. then use a service to create a pdf and mail it Most parts packaged as docker containers... It runs twice a day and sends emails to specific recipients depending on calculated performance and escalated automatically if needed using - pandas, flask, requests, docker, gotenburg project pdf,portainer, html, css, matplotlib and xhtml2pdf before using the service
Huh. I'll look into godot. Might still use cocos because of the highly custom aspect though. My game definitely wouldn't be supported by renpy, unless it supports custom rts and platformer stuff. Nuitka might still be worth it if I need a speedup. I'd make a deployment library though, not something custom for my game, but yeah it'd still be a lot of work.
he's cool
Mine has a bumper that is cushioned with a spring. It hits the wall then moves in another direction. If it it used the tech presented the edges wouldn’t get clean. There is a mechanism to keep it from tumbling downstairs but I don’t know how that works, I assume similar to the presented tech.
Just been thru the code. Pretty smart.
Do you know if there's something already made llke this?
More interested in finding the app itself than learning python. Is there nothing like it online -some direction would be most appreciated

 thanks yeah! I found a tag that allowed for enough space in exif data, Thanks, I'm hoping people will try to use it for machine learning applications mostly. Although I think by using this you could store not just tags of who is in a picture, but also the pixel location of each individual. And this is extensible to any sort of computer vision project, which could then be used for building stronger data sets.
Thanks! Wasn't really sure if people would find it useful or not, had the idea last night!
Maybe you could reconsider learning python. Teach a man to fish, tell him where the fish is etc. If you learn python then you have access to skills to solve many different problems like the one you have for the rest of your life. Your desired solution contains a few basic parts you can probably learn. Google searches: * access [your file type] in python * randomly return a line from a file in python * youtube python api * play youtube with python * etc
`dna = stgr(input("Enter a strand &gt;&gt;&gt; "))` `dna = base.split("")` `complement = []` `for base in dna:` `if base == "A":` `complement.append("T")` `# Do that for every base` Then use the join function to turn the list vars into a string and print the string
Can it go through a corpus and lemmatize it to produce headwords for a frequency list? There are languages, particularly Romanian, which don’t appear to have decent frequency lists, and these are extremely useful for learning purposes. (Sorry, but this wasn’t clear for me from the documentation)
Get user to enter sequence. Then you would split sequence into a list and then convert the lists index values to the correct conversion and print the result

List comprehension and slicing come handy in scenaior like this. Here's just an example maybe it might help. s = 'ACCGTCG' kv = dict(A='T', C='G', G='C', T='A') # Create a Key:Value list as your reference myInput = 'ACCGTCG' output = ''.join([kv.get(i) for i in myInput]) print(output) reversed_output = output[::-1] print(reversed_output)
Yeah, it's pretty neat!
Thank u so much for this but what does the" join" line represent?
Yoyoyo. I'm 14 dyu wanna make something together or something idk if you're cool with it I am
I know some stuff already iv used pytorch and tensor flow. And linear regression and all that jazz. The maths side of computing is my favourite.

"Prism" is an interesting choice of name for a security project. At least it's not all-caps, I guess?
&gt;\[kv.get(i) for i in myInput\] List comprehion, which is this line right here, will break your input string into individual character with the "code" transcribed, and put them into a list. Since your desired output is going to be a string instead of a list, the join function will join all the items in a list together with empty string as delimiter, therefore, create a single string. [kv.get(i) for i in myInput]
Python and chill
Will there be functionality added to decline nouns in languages that do that, or would that be a separate library?
I counted 32 references to individual libriaries and/or other Netflix documents that deep dove (past tense of deep dive) into other libraries. And there's more. Netflix is a major contributer to Spark/PySpark and that was only mentioned once.

I'm trying to go to a really good uni. I'm in the UK and I think I can get the grades it's just I'm scared I'm not gonna. I get straight As right now but in the future I'm scared it's gonna get too hard for me.
Very rarely. Usually I use annotation when I want to restrict the input type.
Yeah. i dont really know how much one can store in a tag, but you can store feature descriptors and feature related data. This would eliminate the process or recalculating them. Im currently building a small Dog classifier for one of my Uni projects, might just incorporate that : )
I wouldn’t worry too much about it. I went to school in the US (I’m sure there are some differences), but as far as my experience goes: - as long as you’re passionate and at least try to get the work done, you’ll graduate - remain in constant communication with your counselors; graduation requirements can change right out from under you so it’s best to be notified of these changes instead of being caught off guard. I’ve known people who stayed an extra year just because of this - the grades are curved most of the time. Chances are everyone’s as freaked out to fail as you are. - keep your ego in check. Everyone’s good at certain things, things you might be particularly bad at. Don’t make judgements or assumptions. Try to be kind to everyone. Sounds obvious, but you have no idea how many dicks your gonna meet 😂 tl;dr: it’s all good fam, you’ll be fine
Of course it could be - it just depends what you want!
Depends on context. If I'm writing something really short/throwaway, then probably not. For larger systems and "enterprise" programming, I advocate using them. I use PyCharm, and one of the nice advantages of using type annotations is that it allows PyCharm to highlight type mismatches, helping to avoid certain classes of problems. It also allows for better tab completion of complex types.
What a time to be alive
From the article: &gt; A question that gets inevitably raised when discussing PyPI’s “business model” is: why not turn it into something that makes money? Why does everything have to make money? PyPI is a machine where you put money in and get software out. (And not that much money either, and an awesome amount of great software which would be *much* more difficult to access without PyPI.)
Personally i use them a lot. It can help to detect errors while writing code with an IDE and you know yourself what the function, which you wrote couple days before, expects. I just don't use them for Lists, etc. cause i am to lazy to remember the syntax and the imports. I just write def total(xs: list) -&gt; float: return sum(xs)
For smaller projects and one-off scripts it feels like overkill, but for larger projects where you need to think more carefully about design they can be useful to keep you honest. The main reason I use them is so that I can take advantage of PyCharm's method auto-completion in more scenarios, and so that PyCharm will let me know if I try to pass an object to a function whose type does not match the annotation. This saves me from more `AttributeError` crashes.
I use them extensively. In fact, I commit to not using primitive types anywhere in my code. I use NewTypes all over for any simple values, all my function signatures are annotated etc. I really like it.
Not specifically but really all you are doing is passing a string to a form which should be reasonably straight forward.
thanks for the reply, ive been having a search for some more ideas and i was wondering if making an AI virtual assistant built on a webpage would be hard enough if i included it with enough abilities?
If it your code has more than ten methods that handle different data types it helps a lot. I use them quite a lot. I try to annotate wherever I can. To the point that I started annotating python 2.7 code (PyCharm understands those and highlights type mismatches).
Yeah, frickin cray—and lesson learned about commit messages :)
Is one able to manipulate it to use an unsupported language, i.e. give it conlang grammar rules/examples and have it conjugate for a conlang?
In python 3.7 you can do "from __future__ import annotations" and use list instead of List, dict instead of Dict etc
Rarely. If they were like Typescript annotations I would use them all the time, but they are too cumbersome at the moment.
That's a good point - might consider it a project and learn python.
I assume this is JSON? It is not balanced (it begins with `[` and ends with `}`) and is not Python in this form because Python uses `None` rather than `null`. `t` is a `list` not an `int` (assuming the last `}` should be `]`). Say you want to access `"i-080210aebba6b7049"`. That is stored as the second element in a list, which itself is stored as the second element in the list `t`. So you would access it with `t[1][1]`.
Cool, thanks for the update.
Dude, I could be wrong but I assumed both the European and the colonies financial institutions used similar nomenclature so that communication is seamless. "M" is still used as a shorthand for 1000 in some financial institutions in the US though it appears that our argument is not new: https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/181917/mixing-use-of-k-for-thousands-and-mm-for-millions where one poster states: "I worked in banking for 27 years (Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta and Bank of America), and my experience in financial services was that M and MM were consistently used for thousands and millions, respectively. This practice was across the board - exam reports, internal reporting, and so on. They never used K for thousands." To be slightly pedantic, you are incorrect when you say "M isn't any kind of short for thousand. M IS ACTUALLY THOUSAND". M is not thousand, 1000 is thousand. M is short for 1000. So $5M is short for $5,000. I apologize in advance for wasting both of our time on this meaningless argument.
You'll be fine when you get to A-levels, especially with projects like this, it reflects well on your personal statement when you apply for universities. I think you're gonna be smart enough to do really well, it's literally all about the effort you put in. Treat it like a 9-5 job never waste your free periods not doing work. I could say a lot about it to be honest, feel free to message me whenever you want!
Well, all except English. English *borrows* a lot of words from Latin, but the core of the actual language and grammar comes from Anglo-Saxon, which is related to German. The only morphology we borrow from Latin is some noun/adjective morphology, no verb conjugation.
I'd suggest adding Esperanto but I can already write a perfect Esperanto verb conjugator in like three lines of code lol.
It is possible, but you cannot access YouTube. What you can do is use pyperclip or xerox library to copy the random word from the list and paste it into YouTube. That is the most ik. So hope it helps or gives you an idea.
Hi, You can indeed add support for a new language, though not through grammar rules but by training a new model by providing a training set of conjugated verbs in a specific json format. You can get more info on how to train a new language model by reading the documentation at mlconjug.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ I will try to update the documentation during the week to make it easier for people with no Machine Learning background to train their own models. But you gave me a great suggestion for a new feature where you would feed a formal grammar to the software and it will infer from them the conjugation classes of the language. Thanks for your feedback. Cheers :)
I read this as Python documentary coming to Netflix D: I would love to see that
Well you can try checking out cv2 if you like working with graphic stuff, that’s basically image/video analysis and stuff like that It is pretty cool and you can do amazing things with it
 cmd = "aws --region eu-west-1 ec2 describe-instances --query 'Reservations\[\].Instances\[\].\[Tags\[?Key==Name\].Value | \[0\], InstanceId, LaunchTime\]'" t=subprocess.check\_output(cmd,shell=True) print(t) print(type(t)) &amp;#x200B; this prints type as &lt;type 'str'&gt;
Hi, I already have a working prototype of noun declensions but I am still working on it. I have to think about if I should include this feature in mlconjug or in a separate library. What would you prefer?
DEEPDOVE sounds like a covert government project
Hi, Unfortunately, mlconjug does not support this use case. I would advise you to use the Python library called Spacy combined with mlconjug to achieve your purpose. Cheers.
Direct URL to the thing: https://www.humblebundle.com/books/python-oreilly-books This is more low-rent spam from the Humble Bundle "partner" spam crowd. Instead of making folks hop 3 times before they're able to get to the thing, why not just link to the thing in the first place?
Yeah lol ;) That's why I did not included Esperanto initially, as its conjugation is pretty straightforward. But I can include it in the next release, it will be relatively trivial to train a model of Esperanto conjugation. Thanks for the suggestion! Cheers.
While you're at it, add Japanese, there's only like three irregular verbs in the whole language.
Didn't realize I wanted to this until now.
Tried it out, was too different for my own use... When pushing the code to Cython after, it takes too much time to remove the clutter... Also, I use Cython for type checking so... Haven't had a need to change.
Also prism
I’m on my phone so forgive my lack of navigability in your project. Re the .connections.yaml file, is there any way to slurp in the credentials from a secure place or any plans to add encryption somewhere down the line? Plain text passwords freak me out 😛
I mean like `list[int]` and all that
Well, Unfortunately, I don't know Japanese and I don't have access to any native/fluent Japanese speaker to check the accuracy/consistency of a Japanese conjugation model. But if you are fluent in Japanese or know people who are and would be willing to try beta versions of mlconjug with Japanese support, it will be my pleasure to add it. I released this project as open source precisely for this reason: even though I studied Linguistics and Machine Learning and can speak 9 languages, I need contributors and/or beta testers to expand the number of supported languages in mlconjug. Any kind of help, bug reports, feature requests, enhancements etc... are more than welcome. My ultimate goal with this project is to support as many languages as possible.
I wish typescript had nominal typing. In fact, I wish the python newtypes were less cumbersome too. I'm not sure I'm convinced by typescript's structural typing effort either though. I wish they both had proper ADT's like Haskell and ML family languages.
r/learnpython
Yeah I know I hate when people assume shit cause they have massive egos. The thing is what I really want to do does require a goodish uni. My main problem is both my parents are graduates of Cambridge. It's just a big thing to love up to I know i can make it but the expectations are high.
So I'll ask, how are these books? Namely, how are they for someone who knows how to program, but wants to learn Python better (and how to write code the Pythonic way)?
Yeah, that one's pretty open ended. It could be super easy or super hard. What "abilities" would you want? Also, I thought I should point out that the VASE auto encoder I mentioned is likely the key to solving a recent google kaggle competition. I think it learns multiple languages too. However, I'm not sure if implementing it right and making something using it would be _too_ hard or not.
We do agree that this is meaningless, but at least we should understand what the other person meant to say. M is a thousand in Roman numerals system. That Roman numerals system has been in use far more time than contemporary "Arabic" numerals system (Arabic in quote as we added 0 to Arabic system and create a brand new one), and we had abandoned it in kind of phases where last usage that stood was in defining dates. I can't say "M is thousand" the way you do, I said that only as reference to Roman numerals. I'll continue to do that on every place on Earth and online, with the exception to the rule when I'm not in company of people coming from financial background - in such a case I maybe will use MM. I surely won't use it if I would make a blog post about PyPI. In every other case I'll say that "M is Mega/million".
I am using Python 2.7. The users desktop.
TDD with python is fantastic. I highly recommend it. From some of the other ones, I got some knowledge. I think it is all worth it for $15
Ah I should clarify. It's not nominal typing that I'm against---its that to type a list I have to write `typing.List[SomeCLass]` and that casting goes something like `typing.cast(SomeDjangoModel, value))`. &amp;#x200B; And type-inferencing is pretty anemic in MyPy; as well as the whole engine being slow. &amp;#x200B; As for nominal typing, in Python I don't need it since I never write code to simply pass around bags of dictionaries or tuples.
It seems like if there are conjugation tables available for any given language- and for a lot of the bigger ones there are- you ought to be able to check its output against that, noIt seems like if there are conjugation tables available for any given language- and for a lot of the bigger ones there are- you ought to be able to check its output against that, no?

Uhh I'm cool with whenever, dyu wanna talk on discord or something?
I said this in a comment above, but as of 3.7, you can do `from __future__ import annotations` and just use list[str] (Not List) without any imports from the typing module. It should be standard in 3.8 I think. There are a load more improvements discussed in pep585. I use nominal typing more for single values than anything
Yeah, Most of times. Even for short scripts, It makes autocomplete work for function arguments. Many dumb run time bugs prevented by mypy. It's especially necessary for larger projects. I don't understand why people aren't use It.
I find it very rare that I'd use cast. Is it something you're doing that's not working with polymorphic types? A case for Union types or a base class on the annotation? I never use fully qualified types from the typing module either. It's always `from typing import Union, Sequence` and all that
How they are cumbersome? What are problems compare to Typescript?

Well, in my non-US country a patent must be novel. If someone can show that you disclosed it prior to a patent application then the patent can be successfully challenged. Maybe the US is different (assuming you looked up US patent law?)

There are several OpenCV demos on the GitHub. There is a [YOLO object detection project](https://github.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI/tree/master/YoloObjectDetection) that allows you to change parameters in real time and watch how it affects the video. The basic architecture/technique for integrating with OpenCV you'll find in the [Demo Program section](https://github.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI/tree/master/DemoPrograms).
Just take the F. It isn't that bad and acknowledging that it's not for you is fine. If it's a big issue talk with your professor and be honest with them. They're people too.
Let see if we can work this out. Obviously something is wrong with the logic you've implemented in the code. Are you using an IDE like pycharm? You could then debug and see exactly what's happening. Paste or provide a link to the code.

Hahah that’s actually so creative! Good luck!
A few different things. I've been using PRAW, made a discord bot that used PRAW stuff in it, and started learning how to use mysqldb.
This is a pretty good candidate for a [Many-to-Many Relationship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-to-many_(data_model)) (SQLAlchemy Docs: [Basic Relationships](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/13/orm/basic_relationships.html)) Basically You'd have a relationship that looks like this: `User` &lt;---&gt; *FriendAssociation* &lt;---&gt; `User` This also solves (with a little bit of work) the transitive nature of friendship. If I'm your friend, you are also my friend. Additionally you can store special data on the `FriendAssociation` to determine the friend type. (Parent, Sibling, Friend, Spouse, etc...) If you have an association like this: User1: Bob User2: Sally Type: Parent You can infer that Bob is Sally's parent, and that Sally is Bob's child. For: User1: Sandra User2: Tom Type: Friend You can infer that Tom is a friend of Sandra, and Sandra is a friend of Tom. If you intend to have relationships that require confirmation you can enforce a direction on that relationship so that: User1: Sandra User2: Tom Type: Friend Would only imply that Tom is Sandra's Friend, and you could require an inverse entry to be added to make the other way true as well. (I.e. Accepting friend requests, etc...) This would be similar to Twitter's Followers, following someone is a one-direction relationship. Hopefully that helps a bit.
Just about done integrating PySimpleGUIWeb with PyGame. This means the PyGame input/output will be to a web page.

Personally I'd prefer a more robust single library. Another question though, and forgive my ignorance: why bother with machine learning for this? Wouldn't it be easier to have it store the individual paradigms, as well as which verbs fall under which paradigm versus having irregular conjugations?
I was inspired by their post about how they use Jupyter Notebooks and wrote a little scheduler to run notebooks on a hourly / daily / weekly basis: [https://github.com/Joshuaek/NotebookScheduler](https://github.com/Joshuaek/NotebookScheduler) I use this, as a Product Manager, to run a bunch of automated reporting covering the usage of various products and features. Making a notebook to track the usage of a feature is nice and interactive, and then scheduling it so I can see how it changes over time once a feature beds in.
You'll want to use Python's `json` module to turn that string into a nested structure of Python objects: data = json.loads(t) Then you can do as I described above with `data[1][1]`. Docs for Python's `json` module: https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/json.html You'll probably want to read up on JSON in general too. In the future, head to /r/learnpython for these sorts of questions.

&gt; Pythonistas Capitalized no less, JFC.
No, because this kinda defeats the purpose of a scripting language, If I need to have more verbosity in my code than I’m probably gonna choose a C style language over python. Mostly because I don’t like they way python introduced annotations (these arrows don’t fit the language in my opinion). At the end of the day, I’ll also have to take into consideration the preferences of my team members and how they decide.
Thank you for the insight. I have never heard of gdb, ollydebug or new ghidra before. I'll start doing some research. I will also take a look at the books you recommended, I've had red team and blue team field manual sitting in my wish list for awhile now, time to pull the trigger! Thanks again
If space usage is a concern, whoever made it could've gone with 100% stacked charts, or, say, pie charts, or something fancier altogether. Visualising shares of a fixed pie is pretty much their whole *raison d' etre*. If visual clarity was the goal, just pick a scale and stick with it. Instead, we got this weird hybrid that does both things badly rather than doing one thing well. Feels like an easily avoidable waste of effort.
&gt; you cannot access YouTube YouTube has an API. You can run a search using the API, get back results and then open a resulting url in a browser.
I switched from Komodo IDE to Pycharm. One of the biggest selling points for me is that PyCharm pays attention to your code when you run the debugger so it can infer the type of a dynamic variable later, when the debugger is not running. PyCharm also uses your annotations for syntax checking. def test(foo: str) -&gt; str: return 123 test(123) In the above, I would get warnings that I was calling `test` with an int and inside `test` I would get a warning. Along the same lines, I follow the advice of this anti-pattern - ["Not using named tuples when returning more than one value from a function"](https://docs.quantifiedcode.com/python-anti-patterns/readability/not_using_named_tuples_when_returning_more_than_one_value.html) ComplexResult = namedtuple("ComplexResult", "foo,bar") def test(foo: str) -&gt; ComplexResult: return ComplexResult(123, dict(a="b", etc="etc)) PyCharm's code intelligence would give me type hints for `test("blah").` with `foo` or `bar` (eg `test("blah").foo == 123`) A lot of other tools are doing similar type checking (eg mypy) which rely on annotations. As part of a full suite continuous integration test, you have much more confidence in your code.
No offense taken! 👍 I would like to eventually write a whole article on `is` eventually, probably from the perspective of the oddness of `is` on integers and strings in Python.
Ive only recently heard of hackthebox challenges. You're right, most penttesting videos are in really sterile environment where the target machine is a Metasploitable OS. Although great for general learning, not very realistic. I haven't really found any realistic penttesting videos, probably because it's illegal lol. I'll have to check Zandid out! Sounds like exactly what I'm looking for. Those tools sound like great projects! And have given me some great ideas, thank you.
&gt; (and how to write code the Pythonic way) Fluent Python by Luciano Ramalho is fantastic for learning idiomatic Python, especially for those coming from other languages or those graduating from basic python syntax. I also enjoyed Test-Driven Development and Flask Web Development and really appreciate the project-driven approach in both. I haven't read Python Data Science Handbook yet, but it's high on my list since Jake VanderPlas consistently puts out great material. Overall, this looks like an excellent bundle.
Coincidentally, I recently watched a video recently where someone compared the execution times of a simple program written in python vs another language (cant remember, probably C). I never really put two and two together, but now that you mention it, it seems obvious. Thank you. What language would you recommend for a simple Jack the ripper script?
Excellent, I'm definitely picking this up when I get home. Thanks for sharing!
I've seen a number of student projects use [PySimpleGUI](http://www.PySimpleGUI.org) as their GUI framework. This [School Grading Tool](https://github.com/sidbmw/ICS4U) was one that I recall as I was surprised by some of the techniques they used. [Their documentation](https://github.com/sidbmw/ICS4U/blob/sidbmw/GRADESK%20Documentation.pdf) has some screen shots from the various windows they used. There are a ton of different [Demo Programs](https://github.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI/tree/master/DemoPrograms) on the GitHub site that shows you how to integrate PySimpleGUI with various other packages such as OpenCV. This [YOLO Machine Learning problem](https://github.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI/tree/master/YoloObjectDetection) uses PySimpleGUI. Maybe one of the demo programs will spark your imagination and help you find a topic you want to tackle for your project.
Yes! This worked! Can't thank you enough!
gcc is the GNU compiler which you can use to compile code to then review with gdb GNU debugger which will let you play around with break points, registers and memory addresses (which is why I mentioned assembly, you will need to be able to read it). Ollydbg is a very popular reverse engineering debugger with a GUI, its very powerful. Ghidra is the newly released reverse engineering tool made by the NSA, haven't used it much but ollydbg is going to be fine. You will want to read up on metasploit and play around with that, extremely useful for exploit writing. Be wary of deciding the end point of what you want to do without reaching decent competency with programming. A lot of people dont find what they are really interested in until they learn about a lot of other security related topics. I only got into security after finishing my Software engineering undergrad and went onto a masters in security.

Drat, reddit has foiled our .capitalize() encryption scheme. Abort. Abort! -- the NSA
Happy to hear your advice on that! I was planning on treating the .connections.yaml file like a .env file - not committed in git, and a bit like the secret key environment variables in most Flask tutorials for example. For a new user or for someone wanting to get a database connection running as soon as possible in the project I can see plaintext, non-committed file being fine but if there is a way to do it that is more secure and/or is better practice, I'm all ears!
If I could upvote a dozen times, I would. This is very useful information, thank you. Embarrassingly, I have Master's in Computer Information Systems and Cybersecurity. The program was incredibly theoretically intensive and the labs were remedial at best. I feel comfortable and familiar with general attacks and vulnerabilities (e.g., buffer overflow attacks, SQL injections, brute force, rainbow tables etc etc). But again, all very theoretical. You've given me some great topics to research! Thanks again.
Thanks! Definitely worth looking into. I'm hearing people migrating more to discord for in-depth content on certain topics. I'll have to take a look.
Awesome and perfect timing! I just started to use papermill+scrapbook at work and was looking for ways to schedule the execution of notebooks. Definitely will take a look!
I might give it a look this weekend to see the feasibility. So what I’m thinking is that people are probably going to want to commit a file like this; sharing db config like this looks super useful for team-oriented projects. I would suggest maybe supporting third-party secret managers like vault, cyber ark, aws secret manager, etc. Allowing the user the declare which one they want to use. But I’m just spitballing, cool project 👍
I'm not complaining, but it really caught me off guard!
https://www.toptal.com/python/an-introduction-to-mocking-in-python Quick Google turned this up. Looks pretty good, enough to get you familiar with the basics then practicing on the job will make you an expert in no time.
I bought these. Good deal. 13 book for $15. Plus you can donate to the Python Foundation. Download in drm free PDF, ePub, and MOBI.
I would be. I'm more focused on Python for networking/sysadmin tasks. However, I have put a lot of consideration into home automation as supplementary income. So if you have some good ideas in that area that are marketable then I'm willing to put some concentration on that. Because I "know" python, I've just never practiced it. And it's becoming an increasingly valuable skill in my profession. Starting a collaborative project will help motivate me to actual write some python code. What is your coding experience?
Clearly it is lame and it shouldn't be used
Unit testing is really what I'm I'm right now. I've been writing my own test code for about a.month now. Here's the basic process of how my days go sometimes: Spend 6 hours patching and mocking where I think is appropriate, feeling like it's super complicated the whole time. Finally ask for help, and my mentor comes back with edits everywhere. And it's like a quarter of lines I'd made. And passes 100%. I know he's had years more experience, but I'm still lost half the time.
Hmmm, maybe. Never tried something like that before, could be interesting. Would you know of a way to make the documents more manageable? Using Renpy all I needed to do was have the scripts be in the same folder. I'd like to have scripts contain different elements so I'm not scrolling back and forth all the time looking for different stuff.
Thanks for the material. I'll dive in when I have a chunk of time!
Yeah. Hollywood. Like Olivia Newton-John 30 year old teenager in Grease.
You can break apart your code into different files that you import. Worst case is you do an import \* which is the same as having the code in the file. It's perhaps a quick and dirty way out if you feel like you must. Your code isn't huge yet, a little over 300 lines. But it'll grow so good that you're asking. There are articles / tutorials that can teach you more about breaking up Python programs.

Hmmm, so if I wanted to say, house my classes separately, but wanted to import the whole file into my main document, how would I do that exactly? The pages I've found have been unclear on the subject.
Make a file called [house.py](https://house.py) in your code you'll then import house Put the [house.py](https://house.py) file in the same folder with your other files for the project.
I tried that, but I keep getting this error. https://i.imgur.com/m2PJzDq.png
You mispelled your import. Your file is named [Locations.py](https://Locations.py). You imported [locations.py](https://locations.py) Upper and lower case matter.
Fixed that, but it still seems to be unable to import things from the other files. https://i.imgur.com/wTj93MZ.png

Well, Jack the Ripper is written in C, so... But since Jack the Ripper was created, new ways of brute forcing hashes became popular (mainly due to Bitcoin mining, which is very similar to this problem, it essentially is computing hashes by brute force until we get satisfying hash response) The other methods are computing through: GPU, FPGA and even ASIC. The later ones are faster, more expensive and language is irrelevant (you are (especially in the last one) literally building a custom hardware that cracks hashes)
hi there thanks for your interest. How do topics like home automation, geospatial data sound ?
Home automation is something I'm very interested in. I'm not familiar with geospatial sound. But if we can get rich doing it, then I'm not against becoming an expert in the field...
&gt; It's also required to use in dataclasses ...for a reason completely and thoroughly unrelated to type-hinting.
What else do you expect from a programming language literally named after Monty Python
what does it do. ?
Do you even understand what is happening in the code? It looks like this is a binding to a shit windows registry method.
Haha, oh 2008 was a rough year.
This was good but next time try for i = 1:9 Make sudoku
u/jaspersales u/ashmorenic You can now use WayScript to pass values using a voice command, as well as have Alexa say a return result.

Fluent Python although a little dated is an excellent book. I wish he would update it for the async stuff and dataclasses but besides that it has everything you need to understand python at a deeper level as an intermediate programmer.
Maybe you could... read the article and find out!
I kind of like that with the exception that you don’t know what the list contents should be. Like a list of route objects, or maybe your dict has a particular structure where you are using a class as the key(pretty sure i saw this in the APIstar source.)
Well the game just got real!
Check out https://moltenframework.com. It uses your type annotations to build OpenAPI schema documentation. This project really got me using them. I am working my way through the first edition of the data science from scratch book myself. I have actually been adding annotations to all his code. I’m interested to see what he did with it.
They are not the same thing though. That's like saying \`Union\[int, float\] == int\`
There's not a lot of code there to understand or not understand.
But how do you check that its a subset? The api doesn't have methods for checking that.
Probably some place-holder text that accidentally got included. No big thang.
Not as far as I know. What are you even trying to do?
Dude this is cringy to be watched as a movie. If someone wrotw a post like this, it would be ooff or considered a joke. This is shit
I hadn't heard of Molten Framework. Thanks! I used Falcon for a simple API last year and was happy with my results, though it was the first time I've written an API and it took me some time to figure everything out (not Falcon's fault).
I made something! https://github.com/lfsando/Average-Frame-Color Would love if anyone contributes to it!! A little script that averages each frame and returns an image with the colors ( not really frame-by-frame since the image would be gigantic, more like every-two-seconds-frames cause it's hardcoded for now ). example: https://i.imgur.com/Xy3nqRH.jpg

My brain though you were going to use the verb 'scrope' and I felt a lot of emotions reading that. Fix your goddamn English 😂
My school used to use this website called Memrise to help learn languages, you (or more commonly your teacher) compiles a list of words/phrases to learn and it tests you by giving you the word in one language and expecting you to write it (or sometimes pick in a multiple choice fashion) the correct word. Fortunately you could see a list of all the words before starting... Someone in my class was a massive sweat and did this all the time, there was a leaderboard that he was eternally the top of. I decided to make a new account, better than&lt;his name&gt; and essentially set it running on the lists we were learning, with a 100% success rate it obviously got wayyyy more points than him. And that was the biggest troll I've done in my school career, I hope to top it one day...
Something makes me think he isn't gonna do that...
I wrote a program that scrapes all the movie magnet links on yts.am 12000 movies links so far.

I have a daily process scraping a dozen combustibles prices, € to $ ratio, weather, wind and solar radiation on all the provinces in our country... Part of my job is making sure this keeps working and expanding data sources when needed.
I am starting out learning python and trying to understand a bit in this code. Specifically why is **word[::-1]** defining a word in the list of words that can be read backwards? The tutorial explanation reports ' The cryptic notation w[::-1] enumerates each letter in a word, but the -1 dictates to step backwards.' Yet, it is still not clear to me how **-1** tells Python to read backwards. AFAIK **-1** indicates the last value in a list? 'from urllib.request import urlopen shakespeare = urlopen('http://composingprograms.com/shakespeare.txt') words = set(shakespeare.read().decode().split()) for word in words: if len(word) == 6 and word[::-1] in words: print(word.title())'
Zip okay?
Ok
Hey thanks for this I am starting out learning and I was able to follow broad strokes. Was great to see the code and your explanation for it.

I have now created a little program that reads in a file with 4x 255 float values and create a delaunay triangulation over the x and y points and 2 interpolations with the delaunay and each of the other 2 points. It looks like this: import matplotlib.tri import numpy as np angle = [] velocity = [] posX = [] posY = [] # Read calibration file filename = "kali.txt" file = open(filename, "r") for line in file: fields = line.split("\t") angle.append(fields[0]) velocity.append(fields[1]) posX.append(fields[2]) posY.append(fields[3]) file.close() print("Data read from file " + filename) # Convert the read data to float values posX_converted = np.asfarray(posX, float) print(posX_converted) posY_converted = np.asfarray(posY, float) print(posY_converted) angle_converted = np.asfarray(angle, float) print(angle_converted) velocity_converted = np.asfarray(velocity, float) print(angle_converted) print("Data converted") # Create Delaunay triangulation over x and y delaunay = matplotlib.tri.Triangulation(posX_converted, posY_converted, triangles=None, mask=None) print("Delaunay triangulation done") # Interpolate angle and velocity interp_angle = matplotlib.tri.LinearTriInterpolator(delaunay, angle_converted, trifinder=None) interp_velocity = matplotlib.tri.LinearTriInterpolator(delaunay, velocity_converted, trifinder=None) print("Interpolation done") # Derived classes implement the following methods: # __call__(x, y) , where x, y are array_like point coordinates of the same shape, 7 # and that returns a masked array of the same shape containing the interpolated z-values. # gradient(x, y) , where x, y are array_like point coordinates of the same shape, # and that returns a list of 2 masked arrays of the same shape containing the 2 derivatives # of the interpolator (derivatives of interpolated z values with respect to x and y). newZ = interp_velocity(3.5, 4.5) print(newZ) print(newZ) just prints -- on the screen .. I hoped I would get a double value for the new Z value ... mmh
I've been using nbdime (https://github.com/jupyter/nbdime) for quite some time, I do check my notebooks (in Python but also many other languages) into version control, and everything is fine…
Thank you for your comment. I tried nbdime as well but it did not work for me. I did the diffing in the notebook and that was cumbersome for me. I prefer to use my own git tools which is gitX for me Can you also convert the ipynb into a py representation with nbdime? Would love to have more insights why nbdime worked for you and why I could not make it work for me \^\^
I scrapped a series of ~50 articles and converted them from html to LaTeX to make a single pdf file I could read offline. Unfortunately, I worked way too long on it (probably could have read half the series in that time) and the code hasn't been *that* useful for other, similar projects.

This made my day.
I’ve done some stuff for work, scraping articles that match keywords, collecting reports from state agencies, etc. Personally I made a scraper that finds products by keyword on a retail sites webpage and then opens the product in your browser. It’s not super complicated, but on this particular website items sellout VERY fast so any extra edge is valuable. It’s allowed me to purchase desirable products which I then resell for extra money. Seeing your code translate to dollars is really rewarding, for me at least. Generally speaking I’m an amateur but I’m really happy of the progress I’ve made.
Could this be done as a git filter?
Sorry, I do not understand you question? Can you please elaborate a little bit more? :)
A long time ago (+10 years) I made an "imdb"-like site for a college project so I got a script to scrap around 20k movies (not from imdb but similar site that I liked more back then), easy and silly thing but it was so cool to see my database with so "much" data :)
What was the post?
Lol it was something like "I wrote a program scrape finance news from websites..."
I don't use the in-notebook diffing, but the VCS integration provided (https://nbdime.readthedocs.io/en/latest/vcs.html). I think that if you have a pure python notebook, you don't need anything, Jupyter already provides conversion to .py (`jupyter nbconvert --to python` or `--to script` and the corresponding menu option). The reverse conversion OTOH is not obvious… (the `%load` magic is not really enough). I think that what really made the deal for me is that nbdime is kernel-agnostic and I do use many different kernels. So I want my workflow to stay the same, even when jupytext is not available…

Yeah the author’s examples folder on the project github will really get you up and running pretty fast. I made a [cookiecutter](https://github.com/androiddrew/molten-cookiecutter) template with everything the way I like it. Now I can toss up an API up in almost no time. I added a little click cli manage.py script too which has been useful especially when I want a shell session. The down side is there are not a lot of extensions for it, I put out a JWT and SMTP mail library myself. So there is opportunity in this space to bring over something you like from another framework ;)
No. they make the code harder to read, especially when you have something like a: int=5 all I can see is int=5

This is not specific to Python. Also most people here probably have no idea what isomorphic means. You probably want to ask this question somewhere where they talk about theoretical computer science rather than any one specific language.
I once had to write a fair amount of complex code revolving around the windows registry. Those are the nicest words I can use to describe that API.

You're coming off as pretty hostile yourself.
I automated submission and downloading of reports from a buncha automotive OEMs at work. Easily my favorite project, and the one I'm most proud of. Shame I can't share any of it (NDA). I calculated the man hours I saved per-month, and my automatons essentially do the work of 3 people so that's cool as heck.
rss feeds dont cover all the movies. They keep only the latest uploads i think.
I made one that scrapes xvideos and downloads videos with all the metadata, I did this with requests and regex before I knew about beautiful soup
Seems legit
Never have. I use assert and isinstance when necessary, otherwise I depend on duck typing and exceptions and skills. In Python, I am looking for the benefits of a dynamic language rather than speed or correctness. If I ever feel the need for a different kind of type system, I use another language. Likewise if I need super speedy code.

Hi, yes that's one way to do it, but as mlconjug is open source, it is hard to find quality conjugation tables that are free of use or uncopyrighted.
Yes that's why English was part of the initial release because its verbal morphology is very simple.
Okidoki, I also think one single library would be the best. &amp;#x200B; And as to your other question, I use machine learning so that even very recent verbs not yet in conjugation tables or even completely made-up verbs can be conjugated with correct paradigm. &amp;#x200B; And never ask for forgiveness for your ignorance! How would we learn new things if we didn't ask questions to which we didn't have answers ;)

Did you try basic Python 3 installation and then installing pandas with pip? I had similar issu while ago and it helped but only temporary. I resolved it deleting manually all previous track of Anaconda from system and registry files.
Python docs are open source and probably written by a variety of folks. I've found tons of hilarious code samples and stuff where I'm like, yup this was written by a nerd with a sense of humor. Then you see another section that is dry as hell and you're like hey man go write some java or some lame windows shit
You can also try Pandas. https://pbpython.com/xlwings-pandas-excel.html - is great source for such stuff.
`list(map(list, zip(*input_list)))`
str.replace() is only a single method for strings. Perhaps you can go with sorted() which is a little more powerful with its arguments. You can show how to sort with different keys and emphasize its applications in data processing.

I am looking to adopt a dog and the rescue I am going through doesn't have a "notify me" feature when a new dog is posted. I build a scraper that runs every hour and scrapes their website and sends me an email with links to the new dogs that are posted.
Kids of that age are going to see **str.replace** as a bit boring, and the connection to STEM is more than a little tenuous (_every_ function of a general programming language can be construed as relating to Technology). I’m also not sure I’d want to get a bunch of teenagers in this moment thinking too hard about censorship. I’d consider a brief overview of **requests.get**, personally. Gathering data from public APIs is becoming a _very_ common job across the sciences, and showing them how to make a request, parse the data to json, then do some basic statistics on it would be a very doable thing within that timeframe. For added cachet, grab some data from the Twitter API and give them some real-time measurements of trending hashtags.

Created a data warehouse project for a university course about PC parts price changes in correlation to cryptocurrency rates. I scrapped products prices from pcpartpicker, pricespy and geizhals using BeautifulSoup. Scrapper was automatically browsing cpus, gpus and ram categories, browsing all products and extracting data with API calls that pages used to load data to javascript chart (had to pass start date, end date and product id). It was one time runner so I'm not proud of this code and it's surely not maintained at all. My parsed and cleaned data was uploaded to kaggle: [https://www.kaggle.com/raczeq/ethereum-effect-pc-parts](https://www.kaggle.com/raczeq/ethereum-effect-pc-parts) Some people asked me to refresh it so they can download more data but I don't have free time to do it unfortunately.
So you have that problem too. It seems wrong that the top Google results for "python anything" should be anything but the /2/ and /3/ (i.e. latest) versions of anything.
That's a really good idea - thank you :)
Oh neat, thanks.
Get them yeezys!
Like 3-4 years ago, I wrote a script that logins and crawls nytimes website, collects articles, converts to .mobi and send as email to my kindle. Nytimes was charging extra 3 bucks for kindle subscription. With a couple hours of coding, I keep my money in my pocket as a student. Still one of my proudest work.
Sometimes it just comes down to "because I can"

It's not usable without javascript, which is a big accessibility red flag.
Git has a built in mechanism to ignore parts of files based on `clean` and `smudge` filters. There's a tool called [nbstripout](https://github.com/kynan/nbstripout) that can be used in this way such that git doesn't see the fragile parts of jupyter notebooks at all.
People Magazine does their "Most Beautiful" issue. I haven't read it, but Jennifer Garner is on the cover this year. But that's just some writer's opinion, I wondered what you'd actually get from data. So I scraped a bunch of "pictures of celebrities" subreddits over a few months and ran an algorithm based on post count and vote count. If you're curious: 1. Emilia Clarke 1. Scarlett Johansson 1. Alexandra Daddario 1. Sophie Turner 1. Gal Gadot 1. Emma Watson 1. Barbara Palvin 1. Taylor Swift 1. Ana de Armas 1. Victoria Justice

I cobbled up a web crawler that takes full-page screenshots of all viable pages of a website. I work as a Wordpress and Drupal website builder. After I am finished building a website and turn it over to the client, they sometimes make changes to the content, like erasing items. Often times it doesn't affect the overall look of the site. But there are times this alters the look of the website. Then the client calls me to fix it, saying that that was how it looked when it was turned over to them. So now, after I am done building a website and turn it over to the client, I use the web-crawler-screenshot-taker script to document how the website looked when they first received it. I also use it before I work on an already built website that needs a re-design.
The only thing I have done is scrapping of videos base on a search just to download and view them offline.

Our local grocery store uses Shipt for delivery. I built a Python script that logged in (via Selenium), scraped the on-sale categories for meat, veggies, and fresh fruit, and then built me a single spreadsheet for each type, sorted by the largest discount percent. I then use those lists to do my meal planning for the week, since the store updates sales 1x per week... normally save $40-50 / week on groceries that way, even with the small markup from having stuff delivered.

The structure of the sdf file is pretty cumbersome. I would break this problem into at least two pieces: 1. parsing the sdf file for the coordinates and other information that you need, 2. taking that information and calculating the molecule distance. Are you able to get the data in any other formats (like a .csv file)? If so, that would help with the first piece. For the second part, I would load the data into a Pandas Dataframe and add a column for the distance.
thats cool is the code open source?
Yeah, I've had that several times. But the difference is, instead of doing some monotonous boring thing again and again, you have fun with much more creative task - coding

Major ongoing progress on a project that was in hibernation for a while: Aki, a simple programming language that uses Python and the `llvmlite` library. * GitHub: https://github.com/syegulalp/Akilang * Official blog (still minimal): http://aki.genjipress.com * Quick demo movie (outdated but fun -- this was from the original incarnation of the project) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vZ4oFCFOl8 The project is now officially an alpha! It was "don't use" until now, because too much was missing, but it is now possible to pull from master and run a Conway's Game Of Life demo bundled with it. If anyone's at PyCon Cleveland and wants to talk details about this project (or their own as well), I'll be there too. I plan to set aside time in one of the book-it-yourself rooms.
Very cool! Is this something you have up on Github, or just kept for personal use?

Did you use requests to login? How do you login?
You mean this was there in the docs for 19 years?
Pretty cool!
Because the Python docs are explicitly intended to be humorous?
Can you share the code? Sounds interesting!
That's awesome! I heard that Craigslist does NOT like scrapers and is pretty quick to ban.
Can you discuss more about the model/data? What kind of modeling did you do?
What I do when I need to parse a binary or text file is first figure out how I would do it manually (sometimes as simple as opening in a text edito, ctrl-f the data, and inspect the surrounding region), write each step down, and then implement that process into code.
Python is definitely the right choice for this! There are libraries for reading sdf files that will probably get you most of the way there. Here's one example, although I haven't tried it myself: https://pypi.org/project/SDF/
Find some video game that you're good at, write a function that describes how some mechanic in it works. A damage calculation, a equipment cost calculator, whatever can be used to guide a strategy. Most teens are into programming solely to make/hack video games, so you need to connect with them on that.
I’ve just realised I can’t guarantee the requests library will be installed on their laptops and probably won’t be able to install it if it isn’t! Damn
I have saved the statistics of every UFC fight in the last 10 years.
I use beautiful soup, but I don’t scrape Adidas. The site I’m referring to is Supreme.
In this case you wouldn't need to write the `: int` part. It would be inferred automatically by mypy.
Step 1 is always "see if there are any libraries which do the work for you". Looks like there are a bunch of file types which use the SDF extension, but this one seems to relate to molecular modelling: [http://openbabel.org/docs/2.3.1/UseTheLibrary/Python\_Pybel.html](http://openbabel.org/docs/2.3.1/UseTheLibrary/Python_Pybel.html) In general, python is a great language for mangling text. It would certainly be possible to write a library to read this file, and I don't think any language would make it easier than python, but the complexity of the file type will always put a lower bound on how complex the parser would need to be. Is there a specification somewhere? If you're doing lots of operations on lots of numbers, you may find python grinds a bit, so it's best to try to get the data from the file and then massage it into either N-dimensional array or tabular format so that you can use numpy or pandas for the number crunching. Scipy has functions for finding all pairwise distances (much faster than doing loops of loops yourself).

I scrape daily local shop's sites for popular electronics and their prices. When some things go on sale they first bump the price to then be able to 'reduce' it at ##% and make it look like an awesome deal. Something which is illegal in my country but happens often. In the end when I'm interested in a product I contact their customer dep with a complaint and mostly get it with a huge reduction, probably driven by concerns of official complaints by regulators. It's also just fun to see the downward trend of pricing from product launch till phase out.

As tunisia3507 already mentioned, you don't want to reinvent the wheel. OpenBabel has been designed for that (and apparently was used to generate your ligands). If you parse the molecules with either the openbabel module or pybel (the more pythonic one), you can easily iterate through all atoms in a molecule and get their coordinates with something like atom.get_coords(). Also, assuming you docked your molecules, you might want to check if your docking program provides something like that already

Found a good API for personal finance data with worldtradingdata.com. It’s free for 200 queries per day with a max of 4 queries per request. Plenty good for personal use and beats scraping. Returns json or csv. Returns Canadian stocks, etfs and mutual funds so that is a plus. Been wanting to do this for a while now.
Awesome! You could then scrape for recipes with those ingredients :)
If this bundle were just $15 for Fluent Python it would be worth the money. Test-Driven Development and Hitchhiker's Guide are both good as well but there are online versions for free.

Well I have only done one thing since I just started with scraping. I scrape weather data from weather.gc.ca. It’s a console application that returns today’s weather and the extended forecast. I did it mostly to learn requests and beautifulsoup. It’s actually turned out quite handy so I am going to rewrite it to pull info from th XML files that Weather Canada lets you use free of charge. I plan to keep the scraping app going though as i want to keep the scraping techniques I learned fresh. Bonus created an exe for my work computer as I have to use windows there. - www.linuxnorth.org/myweather/
That's not a bad start -, could use this - thanks
Sounds about right.
sqlite3 Will let you set up a local db pretty easily. Use pathlib to navigate, load the json files as dictionaries, and then push them to the sqlite3 database. You should be able to get it going within an hour or so.

Thank you! I'm glad you like it! The next feature I want to add is support for more fonts/languages and then I'm going to add a graphical interface for designing and tweaking with web controls instead of having to type GET parameters until it's correct. &amp;#x200B; There will also be a permanent storage option, which will eventually lead to storing images to use as templates. So, you will be able to use a fontawesome icon as a background.

Too broke to buy access to a soccer api so I created a program that scrapes match data for soccer leagues worldwide and using historical data provide a list of match outcomes. Its currently at \~78% win rate so far after 3 months and &gt;1000 matches.
I use them whenever possible. often its like this def thing(floor: int, ceil: int, percent: float): favorite part? works with object types as well so something like this is possible def thing2(param: foo, param2: bar):
Does your project work in real time? If so, can it also track faces? I'm working on a facial recognition / tracker right now as well, but I'm having issues with performance.
[http://rosalind.info/problems/list-view/](http://rosalind.info/problems/list-view/) has a list of bioinformatics problems that - AFAIU - only have the Python standard library available for exercise auto-grading. [https://docs.python.org/3/library/statistics.html](https://docs.python.org/3/library/statistics.html) has a number of functions useful for STEM. Recently, there's been discussion about the implementation of `mode()` on the Python mailing lists.

Thanks! I'll take a look.
For my final project in my last year of school right now, I made a news aggregator that scrapes the content of the top news stories of the day from different publications then clusters them by topic. So, for example, if several different publications run stories on something like the coup on Maduro in Venezuela, those stories should all appear in the same cluster. Then the top clusters, as determined by their size, are served via the API implemented in Django REST framework. I'm working on making a pretty front end right now too.
I did not try it in real time but yeah the predictions take time on cpu so it definitely doesn't work in real time on a cpu. I did not implement a gpu version so I don't know about that.
Sadly it isn’t

SageMath and SymPy are two CAS systems for Python that can solve equations and systems of equations; though getting them installed may be time-consuming if they don't already have e.g. the Anaconda / SciPy Stack set of packages on their machines. Binder ([https://mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org)) and/or a LiveUSB like Sage Debian Live (recently recommended on the jupyter-education mailing list) can reduce the amount of setup time spent solving for lesson dependencies.
&gt; Is there any way I can do that? Yep. What part are you having trouble with? Do you know how to open files? To process JSON? To connect to SQLite? To create tables? To populate them?
I tried to post it there but there are no pictures allowed on this subreddit..thanks anyways :)

A Google Oauth2 POC
I built a scraper to go through the Tui (UK/Europe travel agent) website (with a couple of conditions) to look for two bedroom holiday apartments, because their awkward site made you click through to the accommodation page, before you found out whether they even offer 2 bed apartments. Bad usability! It wasn't perfect, or rather the website information was not always consistent. The scraper certainly reduced the time I wasted. I even managed to scrape some prices too. Since we have booked our holiday now, it has been retired until next year.

I would have thought that conjugation tables would have fallen under the 'can't copyright facts' clause- i.e. what the second person plural subjunctive of 'caber' is is just a fact about reality, same as the length of the Amazon river or the name of the prime minister of Great Britain. You can copyright the particular presentation of facts, but accurate conjugation tables are going to be pretty much entirely the same if they represent the same dialect of the same language.

The company I work for needed a marketing list and based on chambers of commerce for a specific area. I scraped all the business names, addresses, phone #, web url. and their point of contact from their member directory. That was my first time working with beautiful soup and grasping bs4 objects confused me. I did it all after saving a print version of each page because their content was dynamically populated using javascript and i also didn't want to deal with making calls to their server for information so i wasn't blacklisted from their site. It was ugly and hacky but i got the job done. After I had a csv of each page i just combined them all into one with cmd and uploaded it all to our CRM.

I'm supposed to house hunt but it's a pain to sift through 100s of properties on sites like rightmove.co.uk etc. Especially because I want to filter by time it takes to commute to work. So I used Google's Directions API to scrape \~10.000 routes for the entire London metropolitan area and created an interactive colormap with a bit of Javascript together with the scraped from rightmove (with scrapy). Well it turned into a whole web app with a python flask server as backend to help me review the properties.

This is an active project so I can't share source code. Thanks to reactjs, webapps that don't have an official API, have an unofficial one. Unfortunately it would be much to much of a pain in the ass to script out a login procedure via requests, so I skipped ahead. Writing a chrome extension, I can login manually via my browser and then click a sync button in my extension. At this point, the backend part of the extension can connect to a python app via CORS and ajax so that the python app can send arbitrary javascript to the extension. I have a feeling I am not explaining this too well so I am going to rephrase it. I wrote a bridge chrome extension that connects a website to a python app running flask. From there, I can make arbitrary website side ajax requests or just inject javascript to be executed in the browser. In my case, the flask app is called Ransack and it does just that, ransacking the web app of data available to the user via its JSON api. To prevent the web app owners from detecting what I am doing, it occasionally makes document.location changes as well as delaying when the flask app Ransack makes ajax calls. From their perspective, I appear to be a completely normal user.
At my old job I was on the performance team and we had a performance assessment tool that output a very big table with % regression/improvements on lots of tests for lots of builds. Then it linked for each one to a big complex graphing page where you could toggle a bunch of options to see that test over all the data we had etc. This took literally hours to interpret and was super boring. So I built a little tool that would filter the table to the rows with interesting changes, and then it’d go and crawl each of those graph links for the interesting ones, set a bunch of settings so the graphs showed the useful data, and then combine all that into one html doc highlighting all the interesting data and graphs. It even wrote that out to our internal wiki. I found it pretty cool to automate the most boring part of my job, and managers loved it!
Sure I just dug the code out of Google Drive (yikes) and removed the hardcoded credentials... [here you go](https://github.com/calebccff/memrisebot) I wrote it in Python2 for some reason and it doesn't work because the memrise site has changed. If you want some recommendations: * Use selenium * If you want to do something (like wait for an element to appear or whatever, selenium has methods to do this that will make your code less likely to crash) That code is seriously bad...

Working on issues around Python packaging for [Cylc](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow), a cyclic workflow scheduler (i.e. like Apache Airflow, but supports more than just DAGs). We are splitting the project into multiple modules, and also adding a web interface, and have now to start putting everything together. First time using Python [namespace packages](https://packaging.python.org/guides/packaging-namespace-packages/). Not so hard, but stalled a bit struggling due to a `__init__.py` in the main namespace (had to use `pkgutil` syntax there). Still lots of pending issues.
I‘m using a module called fenics for some FEM simulations, it overloads matplotlib’s Plot function. I’m not able to post the code today, but will do it tomorrow.

Does the VCS integration also work if I inspect my git commits on github? Rather not, right?
Thank you, I did not know about nbstripout. However, there is still the metadata overhead and not only the cell content which I personally do not like
Can you write an example of what you mean exactly?
What hovissimo said. In addition, it's not a hard rule, it's a point at which you seriously evaluate just how much this function does.
This sounds helpful and will definitely check it out. I was confused by the initial description where you mentioned notebooks couldn’t be checked into a version control system because the files are not readable. Are there systems that don’t accept it, or did you mean it doesn’t fit into the ideal workflow where someone can review the diffs?
The video explains most of it. This is my first project and am having some issues with certain sites not working, Reddit wont Login, Facebook wont allow for Video Playback (Same with other sites that stream including streams on YouTube).
Sorry for the confusion. I meant that when you inspect the git diffs of a .ipynb file then the JSON structure is not very readable. It is possible but far from ideal. With jupytext you can diff the notebooks just like plain text/code files because what you are inspecting and diffing is actually a .py file representation
This is a very crude example, but in C++ you can do something like this: std::cout &lt;&lt; "{" &lt;&lt; "'key1' : " &lt;&lt; val &lt;&lt; ", 'key2' : " &lt;&lt; val2 &lt;&lt; "}" &lt;&lt; std::endl; Then when you run your program if you pipe stdout to a file you can do something like this: results = [] with open('stdout.txt', 'r') as f: lines = f.readlines() for line in lines: line = line.strip() if line.startswith("{") and line.endswith("}"): line = eval(line) results.append(line) results = pd.DataFrame(results)
What do you want to use it for? That might give us a hint as to what would be the most useful thing for you.
1. You'd better ask this on r/learnpython 2. It simply spans a new process from your Python code and lets you gather output from that process and send input to it. 3. The docs is _the_ way to learn about Python modules, so, if you didn't understand something, first google that and then come back to the docs.
That's smart
&gt;Thank you soo much for replying. I did the required change, however it did not resolve my issue. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I think the problem is that I want to tokenize the string based on white-space and if the string contains any of these characters *, ( ) / - &amp;* it should be added as a single token All other possible characters should be a part of the token, but if I add some character like '\^\^' in the query string, like below it is not shown in the output token import re line = " 8/23-35 Barker St., Kingsford^^, NSW 2032 " pattern = r"[.0-9A-Za-z]+|[,&amp;-/()]" print(re.compile(pattern).findall(line)) output \['8', '/', '23', '-', '35', 'Barker', 'St.', ',', '**Kingsford**', ',', 'NSW', '2032'\] &amp;#x200B; Here I am expecting the output to be like below, which I am not able to obtain \['8', '/', '23', '-', '35', 'Barker', 'St.', ',', '**Kingsford\^\^**', ',', 'NSW', '2032'\] &amp;#x200B; Can you suggest a way to achieve this .
I'm working on a gui to build a computation graph. The users drag and drop boxes which represent functions and make connections between them. The issue is how do you prevent users from making invalid connections. The solution is to use type annotations. Each input and output for a box is tagged with a type annotation. It either accepts this type or outputs this type. Then when a user makes a connection all you have to do is check are these two types compatible.
I replied below.
`eval` is unsafe, use `ast.literal_eval`.
&gt;eval(line) Steady on there. Only do this with programs you absolutely trust and know what will be outputted. &amp;#x200B; But ideally don't use eval it at all. &amp;#x200B; I think you're circling around the concept of structured logging (where typically you log to JSON format and use JSON parsing libraries on the logs). This is indeed very useful as it allows your logs to ingested/processed by other programs and applications for metrics, insights, etc., as you say.
Honestly this is pretty damn cool!!! lol! Quick question though, how do you keep track of errors or bugs? Do you have a log that can track the error codes?
I write stuff using the LAME framework, so I may use this.
Yes, that's all locally hosted. All error's go into the CMD in the background. The only thing is if you exit Webber or the CMD the entire .exe will terminate.
Github link?
and the answers?
You'll need to update your pattern like this `pattern = r"[-,&amp;/()]|[^- ,&amp;/()]+"`. Hyphen should be the first character in your punctuation, otherwise it is trying to specify a range. Similar to how the character class `[A-Z]` works. `[-,&amp;/()]` will catch the punctuation specified `[^- ,&amp;/()]+` will catch all other non space characters where there are 1 or more. pattern = r"[-,&amp;/()]|[^- ,&amp;/()]+" re.compile(pattern).findall(line) ['8', '/', '23', '-', '35', 'Barker', 'St.', ',', 'Kingsford^^', ',', 'NSW', '2032']
Besides of the standard library and performance critical libraries, packages ideally should build upon on pure Python. I also know the pain when a library wants to compile during installtion and then an error occurs because there is a depency missing. In most of the cases, the library could also been implemented in pure Python.
You simply start a command in a seperate process like you do it on the command line. Actually quite unspectacular.
Again... Pass in the right types or fix the type annotation. dict\_keys is an iterable, but is not a list or a tuple. Most code won't care, but sometimes it does. dict\_keys was one of two pain points for me with Python 3.

This worked !! Thank you very much for your response, and for your help. So my regular expression was not complete in its scope to include all the possible characters, which was causing this issue. Can you suggest any good reading material for learning regular expressions. I am currently using the python docs as the only reference. Thank you again!
Practice mate !!! The secret is practice. You will slowly see through them.
http://www.rexegg.com/ is a great source for learning https://regex101.com/ is where you can test things
I feel like if I was older I could do way better, so it's for quality comparison. It's the best I could do.
That's the upgraded sub's kiddo hype.
Never use this in production code! If someone gets control of or can influence the provided data, you have just handed them control of your program.
me too :)
Thanks a lot !
Depending on what your values are, if you just output double-quotes instead of single-quotes, you'd probably have valid JSON. import json with open('stdout.txt') as f: results = pd.DataFrame(json.loads(line) for line in f)
But really, python docs or python's framework docs really have something redditish. Example, documentation about npyscreen. Quote: "The basic framework for a very simple application looks like this: *block of example code* Which doesn’t do anything clever." *derp*
 pattern = r"[^\s,&amp;-/()]+|[,&amp;-/()]+" What about that? The only strange thing is that periods get counted as part of the second character class, for some reason. I can't figure out how to get it counted as part of the non-whitespace in the first character class.
Look harder

&gt;so it's for quality comparison In this sub "quality comparison" expression implies provided code. Btw, happy birthday!
lol you beat me to it, this right here is the solution &amp;#x200B; it'll fail if you input non float characters but as long as you dont do that you'll be fine (if you want to get fancy you can test for this but mehhh, up to you)
Haha! Nice!
This is true =]
There is ast.literal\_eval() to do exactly what OP wants without executing any code.
&gt; "[^\s,&amp;-/()]+|[,&amp;-/()]" Oh dang, good call with the hyphen creating a range! That's why mine didn't work right... So obvious looking back on it now!
First off, /r/learnpython usually tends to be the sub for questions on problems like this. Anywho, a solution for you would be to use the re module to perform a regex search on that string. What you can do to make this easy would be to go to a website like www.regex101.com to test your regex on that string easily. I'm on mobile so this might be messy but a solution would look like: import re re_match = re.compile(r'/(.+),') string = [01-Open]/123456-ProjectName, CATEGORY_UPDATES, SENT, INBOX project = re_match.search(string) print(project.group(1)) I'm no expert so this may or may not work for your needs.

Unfortunately my friend, if you want to have a 100% open source project, you will find out that many useful resources are copy righted or require licensing for academic purposes only :(
Still working on it, but scraping rooms offers from local site, piping though NLP to find location, using some geoloc API to find distance from university. Watching selenium clicking on things is really enjoyable
Awesome post, thanks for sharing! I'm also a Product Manager and I've been learning Python over the last two months. Any advice on use cases or tools you've found especially helpful?
That's how TDD works, right?
I don't think this article is a good source of information. Talking about xrange in 2019? There a lot of repetitious waffly fluff in it as well!
I love you
You're about 11 years late with that joke. That was the original name of my first WordPress blog. ;) [https://laymanstermsdev.wordpress.com/](https://laymanstermsdev.wordpress.com/) (Be careful, it's cringy :D )
Worked at a bike shop and a lot of manufacturers require you to take quizzes on product knowledge to be eligible for a discount on buying a bike. The discount gets better as you complete more quizzes, but there were an absurd amount of quizzes. So I wrote a little scraper to answer the questions randomly, compiling a list of the correctness of the guesses and trying till everything passed.

I lost the code when I borked my Dropbox in 2015. I haven't thought about it in years; the [NASA SDO website](https://sdo.gsfc.nasa.gov/) has changed, but they offer an archive now (I don't remember that five years ago). If I write it again, I'll open source it and post it to the sub.
Question says &gt;Write a function to map all elements of the same index for the following list. &gt;`input_lst = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]` Map them to what? The list only contains three elements and we aren't given a function to map them by.
yuo probably should assign float to synthtest at line 7?
Use the zip function to map the input_lst such that the output is the output_lst. I think this is one of those situations where not really understanding what zip does is the underlying source of confusion. If you understand what zip is doing, it's pretty clear exactly what the problem is asking you to do.
hey! thank you, i went with anaconda after all. lets hope IT does not find out.
&gt; A blind person programming? Is absolutely not impossible, not within a million miles of it. [One of the Python core devs is going blind](https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2019-January/156080.html) and there are many other [visually impaired programmers](https://www.reddit.com/r/Blind/comments/9s7cyg/screenreader_accessibility_issue/). I've worked with two legally blind programmers, one went on to get a PhD. I knew a mathematician who was very prolific on a number of email discussion forums who was totally blind, I only discovered he was blind when he made a comment about not understanding what I had written because his [screenreader software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_reader) was mispronouncing it as another word. All the major non-free OSes (Windows, Mac, Android) come with screenreader software standard. You could be interacting with blind people every day and you would never know it. &gt; that person would also have an OCR solution You don't need OCR technology if the text is already in the form of text.
I wish I applied my curiosity for coding at 14. See you on the Moon to greatness. Awesome!
Made a post about it by r/learnpython https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/bja6u5/its_ugly_but_it_works_and_i_want_to_make_it_better/
Yes, [Reddit is used by blind people.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Blind/) From the side-bar there: "While inaccessible content is not necessarily forbidden, users are encouraged to vote down content that is inaccessible to them. Pictures of text are inaccessible and individuals posting this content should use caution and be mindful of the audience."
No, not 19 years, they said it was written in 2000! That was only.....wait............oh God...
Are you explicitly assigning the the java variable? and how/why are you calling java? If it's to run JAR programs you should set the java path: JAVA=\\PATH\\TO\\JAVA Then call it: $JAVA -jar JARFILE I think when you call the script in the terminal, it's essentially inheriting all the variables. This is probably why it runs from the terminal but when you double click it. What OS are you running?
I know what the author is *trying* to say, I'm just saying its terribly worded for someone who is trying to do python tutorials.
I really don't think so.
Then try this one: Write a function to map all elements of the same index for the following list: `input_list = ['a', 'b', 'c']`
Same case here. When typing becomes important, I use Java or Scala.
Sure, and what is the output\_list that I'm targeting?
Just map all elements of the same index and return them as the output_list. Its fundamentally the same problem, you're given a list of three elements and you need to map them by same index.
It's not fundamentally the same problem. We have 3 strings with indices 0, 1 and 2. None of the indices ever match so there is no way to use zip to pair them by index. In the example that you're saying is confusing, we have 3 lists and each list has it's own index of 0, 1 and 2. So there's no confusion over what it means to pair elements by their index. There is only 1 thing it can mean. From each of the 3 lists, pair item at index 0 with the other ones at index 0. You're trying to demonstrate that the question asked doesn't make any sense by giving an alternate example which is literally nonsensical.
If you just set that variable, then log out and upon login /etc/environment will be read by the system.
In OP's problem we have 3 lists with indices 0, 1 and 2. None of the indices match because one of the properties of a list is that there is only one element per index... The elements, in OP's problem, are lists, but it shouldn't matter what type of object they are. I'm demonstrating that the problem is nonsensical by showing that a) OP's proposed output value doesn't jive with the problem statement and b) your interpretation of the problem can't be generalized to other classes
I really don't see what point you're making. The original problem gives a list of lists and tells you to use zip to pair elements of the 3 lists by index. And it gives the output that shows precisely the interpretation that makes sense, which is that you are paying all the elements with index=0 with one another, all the elements with index=1 with one another, and so on. How you think this is related to giving people a 1-dimensional list and then asking them to pair indices when there aren't multiple sets of indices to even pair up is confusing.
Great job! Keep at it, and happy B-day!
&gt;Map all elements of the same index for the following **list**.
Can you name one single site with more than 10 million MAU that is accessible without JavaScript? If someone's accessibility software doesn't work with JS then they should upgrade from their 1990 version to something modern. Reddit is not shit because it doesn't work on dialup. Facebook is not shit because it can't accept telegrams. Why should Reddit be parseable without JS?

run repair_save.py and then run it with import sav.
Yes, I don't understand what part you think is confusing. The input given has the following indices: \[\[0, 1, 2\], \[0, 1, 2\], \[0, 1, 2\]\] So I don't see what is confusing about the statement "Map all elements of the same index for the following **list**.". The index 0 appears 3 times, so your function should map the values with matching indices to a new list. What other interpretation could there possibly be? You obviously wouldn't map elements with index 0 and 1 into a new list. They don't have the same index. It tells you to use the same index. Your input example has the following indices: \[0, 1, 2\] So in your example, what does it mean for an element to have the same index as another thing? None of the indices ever repeat. So there's nothing to be done with the zip function. Again, your example legitamitely doesn't make any sense. But the original one makes sense.
Pretty neat. I feel like I would try to get my children to learn to code too if I ever have any. If you're creative anything is possible with programming
Finished face detection and recognition last week, going to expand that to recognise expressions as well.

I've been webscraping Metacritic and PSN to collate game reviews and then draw some statistical conclusions. I've never used Python before and it'd been a real eye-opener!
My favorite is a script I wrote to get Zion national park narrows top down back county passes. I was able to get a group of 18 young men to hike it split up into two groups over the course of two days. Those things are hard to get. So my script would check to see when one became available and text me the link to register. The idea was so useful I modified it to register my son for summer camp. My wife thinks the coolest thing I’ve done is slurp her blog to make it easier to publish with Shutterfly.
So... username checks out?
&gt;The input given has the following indices: [[0, 1, 2], [0, 1, 2], [0, 1, 2]] &gt;You obviously wouldn't map elements with index 0 and 1 into a new list. They don't have the same index. It tells you to use the same index. Exactly, which is why the problem statement makes no sense.
I'm not sure what you're talking about. A list of list has nested indices. So the outer list has indices \[0,1,2\] and each of the inner lists has indices \[0,1,2\]. But that doesn't impact what you're being asked to do. In fact, essentially what they are asking you to do is to group all inner list elements of index 0 into the outer list index 0. And inner indices of 1 into the outer list index=1. It's pretty clear that you just want to argue and are unwilling to acknowledge the obvious. I'm going to block you and go on with my day.
Okay, hope you learn some python in that time.
The OS is linux. I figured out how to get it done with os.system but I don't know how to do it yet with subprocess. Running the script in the terminal works fine but double clicking and I guess it executes with /usr/bin/env python3.7 unless explicitly set does not work because it does not load the environmental variables.
This actually works in os.system : cd jmbe; export JAVA\_HOME=$(readlink -f /usr/bin/javac | sed 's:/bin/javac::'); ./gradlew build &amp;#x200B; How do I do that with the export with subprocess
the environmental is set fine its not reading when double clicked but works in terminal.

&gt; It's the best I could do. That's ridiculous!
Yep; best way to get feedback on any given work is to share your code so that it can be poked at, and so that folks can point out anywhere that might be in need of polish or improvement.
Nice! Nice! **golf clap**
That was a very nice read, I'm always trying to teach my daughter how to code, but nothing ever really managed to keep her interested. I will definitely give that a try
To build something that runs every hour, you use “sched” module right?
Hi, author of Pygame Zero here. Great article - you really pinpoint the thinking behind the decisions we made in creating Pygame Zero. I love the film strip and paper metaphors. I might use these in documentation in the future! Will you be at PyCon? I'd love to chat further.
&gt;"fun and playful" was once the dominant kind of programmer. And then there is the group of people who appear to be building up their ego on the ability to code. They IMO are the worst since they act like you being able to do it too is some kind of attack against them and feel the need to turn any coding talk into a proverbial dick measuring contest.
How on earth is it "being a dick" to let people know that posting **screenshots of text** is hostile to blind people? Folks are taking content (text) which is 100% accessible to the blind and **intentionally** turning it into an inaccessible format (jpegs). They might be doing it out of thoughtlessness rather than malice, but it is still a hostile act. He was absolutely mocking people with disabilities by exaggerating my statement to the point of ridiculousness. Text is not hostile to the blind since it can be read by screen readers, which is the whole point. And the use of braille on screen (as opposed to a dedicated braille reader) is so obviously a dumb idea that of course u/DuffBude is mocking the blind. You don't need to be blind to see that. In reality, there was nothing even remotely rude or dickish about my tone. People need to get over themselves and stop treating even the slightest, mildest implied criticism as an attack. It wasn't an attack, it was a matter-of-fact statement of reality: posting screenshots of text is rude and thoughtless. Don't shoot me, I'm just the messenger.
I'm sorry Princess, but did I trigger you by treating you as an adult capable of receiving criticism and not sugar coating my words? /s You and the down-voters are [tone-policing](https://everydayfeminism.com/2015/12/tone-policing-and-privilege/) as a way of defending the thoughtless privilege of the sighted to discriminate against the non-sighted. It is 100% [a silencing tactic](https://groupthink.kinja.com/on-tone-policing-why-its-bullshit-and-why-you-need-to-1148310719) to tell me to shut up and not to remind you of your thoughtlessness. In reality, there was nothing even remotely rude or dickish about my tone. People need to get over themselves and stop treating even the slightest, mildest implied criticism as an attack. It wasn't an attack, it was a matter-of-fact statement of reality: posting screenshots of text is rude and thoughtless. Don't shoot me, I'm just the messenger. "I'd consider..." is what Wikipedia calls "weasel words". **I** don't need to "consider" posting text,**you** (generic you) need to stop excluding the blind and being so inconsiderate, not just "consider" it. If this were one of the Python.org mailing lists, posting unnecessary screenshots of text would absolutely go against the Code Of Conduct of being *considerate of others*. But this is reddit, where being selfish and inconsiderate is considered a human right. As developers, receiving screenshots of error messages or bug reports from end-users is a constant source of frustration. Thanks for the pixels, now I have to retype what was already text back into text before I can search for it, or run your sample code, because the user was too inconsiderate, thoughtless, ignorant or lazy to copy and paste the text into their bug report. This is no different, but because it affects "other people" instead of "me", the folks on this sub are defending their right to be equally lazy, inconsiderate and thoughtless.

Nice article, though I have to wonder if Python is really the right tool for kids that young. I remember using LOGO when I was 7, and figuring out how to use it was challenging without having my hand held. I am pretty sure I have been lost with this python code.
Yes, in fact, I will be at PyCon this year and would love to chat about Pygame Zero. I work at Doctor on Demand and will be working at their booth. I'll also be around for sprints for a few days. Hopefully, I'll see there!
Because not thinking to accommodating blind people is not even in the same universe as being hostile to blind people. Hostile to blind people would be posting a screenshot with the caption "I'm posting this as a screenshot because fuck blind people". Your tone WAS dickish, and you were mocked for that with sarcasm. Any idiot could see he wasn't mocking blind people with the braille thing, he was mocking your stupid ass.
Perhaps a dumb question...but how much version control is needed in typical notebook usage? Do people overwrite cells that frequently? If I work on a model, then decide I want to try a different type of model, I just use a new cell. History is preserved. A diff in this case would just show additions. I generally have a working notebook that wouldn't really benefit from VC, and when it's time to share the analysis, I create a shareable copy that trims out the unnecessary bits. What workflows would make use of good version control?
I think this will do greedy matching and pick up everything to the last comma rather than stopping at the first comma. Use (.+?) for lazy matching instead of just (.+) Alternatively you could say that you want to match any characters except a comma which would look something like ‘/([^,]+)’
I think the real issue isn't OP being hostile toward the blind anymore than he's being hostile toward people without access to computers. Why even mention the official Python docs when there are tribes in Africa who are starving? Why does this question exist when AIDs still exists? &amp;#x200B; Why are you spending your time here instead of curing blindness?
Reddit data collecting for NLPs
OP, I think you would like [TinyRenderer](https://github.com/ssloy/tinyrenderer/wiki).
Using termcolor? Or any other package for text colors?
No can do. That needs admin privileges.
Those apps need admin privileges.
Because it's honestly possible for Reddit to generate an accessible version of its site with little effort. Lots of the web functioned quite well on limited JavaScript and I feel like developers tend to forget this, especially when they start recreating features in JavaScript that are already native to the browser itself, but are inaccessible to the blind.

Maybe share the code or something to help you. One way to check collision is to check the direction you are going, and in that direction, check the next 'n' pixels for another object you can collide.
&gt; zip only does 1 thing and that's match up indices of two objects. `zip` does nothing with the indices, it collates the items of any non-zero number of objects, including one or three: py&gt; list(zip("ab")) [('a',), ('b',)] py&gt; list(zip("ab", "cd", "ef")) [('a', 'c', 'e'), ('b', 'd', 'f')] Of course, calling `zip` on one object is a waste of time, but nevertheless it works, More importantly, it isn't limited to *two* objects.

It is being maintained, with releases about every year. Every year is a bit slow but it is due to both limited time to spend on it and an abundance of caution about giving beginners experimental things that may change and break them later. Currently there is quite a lot of work from sprints at Europython and PyCon UK still to integrate for a 1.3 release, and I'd like to sprint on this at PyCon.
