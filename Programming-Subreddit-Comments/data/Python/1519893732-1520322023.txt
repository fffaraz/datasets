Range is a generator
I've always referred to computed types as padded. I need to start using this lazy term. It's good. &gt; do not use the information below as an excuse to be unkind to anyone Don't put beans in your nose! &gt; If you’re looking for a description for range objects, you could call them “lazy sequences”. I think this the most important statement of the article. I mean, looking at the source we see [range is a large and very padded/contrived sequence-like object](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/6cca5c8459cc439cb050010ffa762a03859d3051/Objects/rangeobject.c). Lazy. I mean lazy sequence-like object. ;) Once that's clarified we can compare it to what it is not.
Questions like this should be posted in /r/learnpython. Show your *entire code* and the *exact error output*.
Just a simple wrapper for Google API. :-(
Alright I'll move over there. Thanks!
no, generators can be used with next and be exhausted. i suggest you read the article and learn somehing new ;)
The folks at QT are planning to make Python+QT better in 2-18, so hopefully this'll make things better for you https://blog.qt.io/blog/2018/02/22/qt-roadmap-2018/
Of course, f-strings support arbitrary expressions. One could write a polyfill that parses the argument to `f` with `string.Formatter.parse` and then passes the `field_name`s to `eval` but at that point it's probably easier to just upgrade to 3.6...
Probably a better fit for /r/learnpython. Functions implemented in C rather than in Python often don't support having their arguments supplied as keyword arguments. I don't know why, probably because otherwise functions implemented in C need to pass the argument names as strings back to Python.
&gt; Python Foundation should spend resources on solving this issue of program distribution first instead if releasing new versions of python. No thanks.

gmail is the king of lame. i had to disable their spam filter (there is stil an undocumented function to turn this scrap off) so it stopped eating important mails. the only thing google implemented perfectly is mining all your personal info, and tracking all your web activity. not only that, now they are actively shaping what the world is allowed to say/see (youtube), brainwash their employees and wage on full Feminist / SJW propaganda war. my condolences to anyone who in any way, shape or form trusts the Orwellian monstrosity that google has became a long time ago.
More that: * `range()` is a function which returns range objects * range objects are iterable * Calling `iter()` with a range object gets you an iterator * You can call `iter()` on a range object multiple times and get a new iterator each time Now, why range doesn't return an iterator directly? Well I expect that's because the old (python 2) range returned a list, and a list can be iterated over multiple times. If python 3 range returned an iterator directly, it could be iterated over only once.
What's the crucial difference?
&gt; white-whale see [IUP (http://webserver2.tecgraf.puc-rio.br/iup/)](http://webserver2.tecgraf.puc-rio.br/iup/), a pretty good, pretty slim cross platform gui lib. also [RED (http://www.red-lang.org/)](http://www.red-lang.org/) (currently in development, nearing 1.0). A programming language / DSL notation, and a bunch of DSLs (VIEW - the GUI dialect; PARSE - powerful dialect for parsing; Red/System - C-level language, in which Red is written). A whole self-contained multiplatform toolchain (no external dependencies), able to cross-build from any platform to any platform, with GUI and other batteries (even blockchain) included. Expected to weight only a couple MB (original plans were to fit it all in 1MB, but it might not be possible).
Cool thanks. Maybe there was some temporary DNS issue.
I was just trying to let people know it's more than just a sales pitch for Docker. If I were an unbiased reader and looked at your TL;DR I would assume the post is low quality garbage, but it's really just a simple guide on getting Python in 2 different ways with some opinions thrown in based on real world experience.
I think I also saw something somewhere in their bullsit like "if we are really really sure that it is spam, we'll delete it immediatelly". At least I had to use an undocumented way to turn off the spamfilter, so I could recieve one specific confirmation mail (no, it wasn't going into spam). And if you have a mailbox that you only check occasionally, and one day the only thing you see in you inbox is spam, while the mail you know has been sent to you some 2 months ago is gone ... Fuck google, gmail is only suitable for throw-away accounts of the "no way you are forcing me to give you the mail I'm actually using, shitheads" kind.
Just do it, write a report and share it. When people asked how you did it share the source code. Senior Exec's won't give a flying fig how it was generated if it gives them insight. Make sure that your code is clean, well presented, commented, and checked into version control. Don't make a big deal out of it.
That didn't stop them with zip() or the others.
Because `-1 in range(10 ** 999)` would be *super slow* if it worked by iteration, whereas it's near-instant and takes hardly any memory as a range object. `zip`, `enumerate`, et al are inherently transformations of existing iterables or iterators, and thus can't take advantage of calculation in the same way.
When was the last time you used Docker on Windows or Mac? It's gotten really good in the last ~9 months or so. I use Docker for Windows for full time development and have not experienced any of the issues you mentioned. Volume mounts work exactly the same as Linux with no extra work, I visit my web services on localhost:8000 (or whatever port I specify) without having to port forward anything, and I never had to deal with hyper-v (the underlying VM) directly. It's really fast too. Flask apps with 4,000+ lines of Python get updated with volume mounts in less than 100ms. That is in a worst case scenario too where the mounted code isn't on an SSD. I'm even able to process 250kb of SCSS into CSS through webpack in about 1.7 seconds using a volume mount that's not on an SSD. 3mb of ES6 JS gets converted through a bunch of webpack loaders in around 400ms as well. I really couldn't ask for a better all purpose web development set up.
Meh. Can't say I've ever used that to check if numbers are in a range given that we have `0 &lt; x &lt; 10**999`. I guess there's more to it when you have a step-size other than zero. I suppose `range()` objects are now a bit closer to being like numpy slice objects.

If an API is popular enough it could have a python client library that constructs the HTTP request for you behind the scenes. Otherwise you’ve got the idea. You should use the request library instead of curl to add timeouts etc. “Correct” usage of an API depends on your use case really. 
I didn't use it on Mac / Windows. Some people in the office did. What was the last version used? -- I believe it was version 17. It's hard to tell because they keep re-branding their product and change versioning scheme all the time. What do you mean when you say it's fast? Which aspect do you refer to? But, whatever it is, on Windows or Mac, it won't be any faster than the VM you need to run. Other aspects will depend on whether you need to modify files in the container or not. Everything else is just the same as if you were running whatever program it runs on the host system.

An iterator is stateful: Everytime you do a `next`, whatever item you get is forgotten by the iterator. It's one very specific kind of object with very specific and well defined behavior. Iterables are under no such restriction. They can be any sort of object, which may or may not have a length, may or may not be consumed, may or may not be indexable, etc. The only thing that makes them "iterable" is that they define an `__iter__` method, so that you can do `iter(thing)` to get an actual iterator (converting from a general object with unknown/complex behavior to the very specific iterator object with well defined/limited behavior).
The reason people call them iterators is because they're iterable. This is incorrect, but this is the heart of the problem you're trying to address. If you punish someone who is interested in knowing the difference, by having them read through a list of things that *range* also isn't, before you explain the title, they are going to lose interest. You may as well chuck in that range isnt a string but is also immutable and indexable! For an article as meticulous as yours, tl;dr belongs **first thing** in your post: Range is not an iter*ator*, it is iter*able*... like any other sequence
were you presenting results they were happy with ? yes. they cannot claim you weren't doing your job. hire a lawyer, so that they don't screw you over. preferrably one also versed in copyright law, so they don't necesarrilly screw you out of your sources without [due compensation] - you have to be very careful about what you say, or they could claim the code belongs to them. were they smart, they would be talking to you about promotion, into the [perhaps newly createted] department for R&amp;D/automation, find some positive way to get this into their heads ('twould be better if someone else was saying that, even if he was on your side).
Yeah, I'm against TLDRs. If you can summarize a post into a single sentence, then it should be done so at the beginning of the post and then spend the rest of the time explaining in detail what you mean.
Watching and auto-reloading are usually enabled for ease-of-development, and turned off in production. For example, Django comes with a dev-server that autoreloads on framework changes so you don't have to run nginx or apache or others in development.
What framework are you looking into? Django for instance has a devserver built in that autoreloads; so you shouldn't need to use apache/nginx in development mode. Personally, I'd not configure mod_wsgi to run while developing the application since you'll have to restart it dozens of times an hour and that's tedious.
I feel the Tl,Dr is a bit unfair with the subtlety this post tries to cover. It was very easy to read and an eye opener. I guess I've never really talked about iterators in the range/xrange case but about lazy so I didn't really mistaught many people but it's great to know the subtleties and where do they impact (eg.: Consumable, next, etc).
So far thx. I want to write code, but I dont understand API calls and such.
I see. I’m not familiar with Cisco APIs but maybe there’s some tutorials here https://developer.cisco.com/
I'm aware of that.
The python interpreter creates an iterator object under certain circumstances. This object can be created from any object that is iterable, which includes ranges, lists, even dictionaries.

In my opinion, *range* is a needlessly complicated sack of crap. Python has these wonderful primitives built right in -- lists, generators, dictionaries, etc. You are encouraged to use them for your own stuff. And *range* comes along and says f-you, I'll do it myself. Those might be good enough for you, but not for me. And why? Because the elements can be computed fairly easily? So what. *Special cases aren't special enough, remember?* Make it a list. That's alright with me. It is immediately familiar to any Python developer. *"But what about my big-ass list? Isn't that wasteful?"* (Who cares, but...) *fine*, make it an iterator. More complex, but still entirely accessible to any Python dev. *"But what about random access to the elements?"* Well, you didn't want a list, so... *"But what about it??"* Fine! For the one time in your life you need random access to an incomprehensibly large list of numbers whose pattern is easily computable, I'll give you this: initial + index*step You're welcome. Can we have a sane *range* now?

I’m curious what benefit that offers you. 
Not as far as I'm aware, but its fairly easy to do regardless. Its not pointless to know how to set your background from Python though, I had to dive down that rabbit hole myself recently while working on [Cozy](https://i.imgur.com/Atg3PW1.jpg) (WIP) Here is a function you might find useful to pick apart: def apply_wallpaper(): # Find out where we are in the filesystem relative to the script itself here = os.path.dirname(os.path.realpath(__file__)) # Different methods of applying the wallpaper are needed for each platform if platform.system() == 'Windows': ctypes.windll.user32.SystemParametersInfoW(20, 1, f"{here}\wallpaper.png", 2) elif platform.system() == 'Linux': print("Add wallpaper setting utility to settings!") elif platform.system() == 'Darwin': subprocess.Popen(['osascript', '-e', f'tell application "Finder" to set desktop picture to POSIX file "{here}\wallpaper.png"']) Supports OSX and can support *nix (Setting a wallpaper under a *nix distro is.. an interesting process, I'll not get into it )
`?[41m ` looks like an ansi color code. Make sure your terminal is setup to handle that. You should check the docs for urwid to see if there is some init code it needs to setup the terminal: i've never used this library
This seems to be more multifaceted than I expected. I've had people respond that they have made this exact mistake in the past, even assuming that `next` could be used on `range` objects. I think I now have an understanding for the various categories of people who are responding to my article: 1. Some people assume iterator and iterable are interchangeable words 2. Some people use the term iterator for all the "lazy" Python built-ins (including `range`) not knowing what it really means 3. Some people know very well what iterators are but incorrectly assume that `range` objects are iterators 4. Some people know what iterators are and know that `range` objects are not iterators 5. Some people don't know what iterators are but also never wondered whether `range` objects were iterators I was writing this article for 2 and 3. I probably could have targeted 1 (and maybe 5) better. 😉
Thanks! I'm really glad you enjoyed my writing style. 😊
Hey Jon! I'm still using a GitHub static site for hosting. If I ever switch to a real host or a real blogging platform (which certainly might be worthwhile eventually), I'll definitely look into conditional redirects.
I may be misunderstanding your question, but I think the built-ins might be what you're looking for: &gt;&gt;&gt; zip() &lt;zip object at 0x7f112cc6cc08&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; z = zip([1, 2], [3, 4]) &gt;&gt;&gt; z &lt;zip object at 0x7f112cc6cd88&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; next(z) (1, 3) Or if you meant iterators that don't loop over other iterables as inputs, maybe `count` in the `itertools` module would be a good example: &gt;&gt;&gt; from itertools import count &gt;&gt;&gt; c = count() &gt;&gt;&gt; c count(0) &gt;&gt;&gt; next(c) 0 &gt;&gt;&gt; c count(1)
Yup! I just heard the term [calculated sequence](https://twitter.com/ncoghlan_dev/status/969048493414260736) as a description for `range` objects and I like it.
AFAIK bs4 has no js support.
AFAIK MechanicalSoup doesn't support js.
Maybe I'm misunderstanding something, but many here seem to be missing that this supports js, while the things people say already exist for the purpose don't.
&gt; However, understanding how matplotlib’s interfaces interact is an investment that an pay off down the road. As Real Python’s own Dan Bader has advised, taking the time to dissect code rather than resorting to the Stack Overflow “copy pasta” solution tends to be a smarter long-term solution. Sticking to the object-oriented approach can save hours of frustration when you want to take a plot from plain to a work of art.
Buffer. You aren't going to be 1:1 with the stream as its going anyway, just shove as many frames into a buffer as fast as you can and keep pulling the oldest frame while removing it from the buffer. But honestly at that point why not just use [libmpv](https://mpv.io/manual/master/#embedding-into-other-programs-libmpv) with the [Python bindings](https://github.com/jaseg/python-mpv) and chuck a url at it and call it good?

Yes it seems like urwid does not support any of the ansi color codes. So the question is how do I achieve what i want with urwid?
urwid has its own ways of setting color which will be detailed in their docs. A solution would be do that and not mix libraries. If you want to use both libraries, I am not qualified to answer as I've never used urwid.

First, it might be easier if you copy and paste your code here rather than take a picture. Second, r only exists in your random_var method, so once it's finished r stops existing and main () doesn't know what you're referring to. Try having random_var return a value instead and try to work from there.

**TLDR;** if you need a TLDR about a blog for beginners about one of the most basic constructs in the language, your language (or docs) might be broken.
If you want more details on the difference between an iterator and an iterable, that's really what the article gets into and does a good job, IMO, of clearly explaining them.
Thanks, that's exactly what i need.
I don't see how this would be confusing though. `range()` generates a range of numbers. You can iterate over this range, but `range()` itself is not iterating over anything, it just generates a bunch of numbers. Like /u/deadwisdom said, it's an iterable, not iterator.
Thanks for your reply,I thought r is a object that is created and any function can use it,I started python yesterday so I kinda suck.
My bad 
 import random def random_var(): return random.randint(0, 10) def main(): r = random_var() put = int(input("Choose a number between 0 and 10")) if put == r: print("Correct") elif put &lt; r: print("Less than the number") elif put &gt; r: print("Greater than") main()
Im already stuffing frames inside stringio, is that what you mean? Imma read about libmpv. The problem is i also have to get each frame in a format that is compatibile with pygame, like a jpeg is.
You probably want to look at `nohup` utility. There's also `disown` for the process already parented by your SSH session.
None since my main language right now is GoLang. It’s a nice reminder of how generators work and I enjoyed the writing style.
"Visual Studio Code users can now also use many of the nice features on PyDev ;)" I've ditched Eclipse/Liclipse for VS Code, so this is fantastic news. I'd like to see some of the features I saw in Liclipse in VS Code, like the way a module had an at-a-glance view of all functions/classes in it.
Yes, you're right! Thanks for your feedback. We will make it more obvious that PEP567 solves the issue 👍
I can easily do this in Linux with nohup, screen or anything else. But I'm looking at doing it internally in the Python code since some customers might forget to use nohup and then they will be unable to reconnect to the system b/c the network interface will be down.
That was extremely helpful, and very clear. Thank you.
To be honest, I forgot about it until now :D But if you want to use any of it for yours, feel free! Cheers

I’m asking you why you care whether he had a redirect. How is it of benefit to anyone.
To be fair, the term "generator" is overloaded. A generator iterator is an iterator and can be exhausted. A generator function returns a generator iterator, and behaves a bit like `range` in that they both return iterables. "Generator" can refer to either depending on the context.
I used your eval trick to add support for calling methods!
&gt; So when writing functions you need to be mindful you could be passed an iterator rather than a sequence, though obviously someone else could have written code assuming a function's arguments were sequences. That could be an unpleasant logic bug to track down. Absolutely! It's definitely important to keep iterators in mind when talking about "iterables". The only thing you can assume about an iterable is that you can loop over it. You can't assume you can loop over it twice and get the same items back. Consider this: def numeric_range(numbers): """Return difference between biggest and smallest.""" return max(numbers) - min(numbers) That won't work on iterators because the iterator will be fully consumed by `max` before `min` even has a chance to loop over it!
You'd be surprised just how painful it is to upgrade to 3.6 on Debian. A ton of packages depends on 3.5. If I try to upgrade to 3.6, it wants to upgrade libreoffice.
Oh, that. Well, I’m more devops than software engineer, so I like to see things well secured. With how easy proper HTTPS is today (seriously, Let’s Encrypt is my favorite thing), I feel that having a proper always-encrypted experience is a badge of pride and its lack a sign of incompetence. If you work into a mechanical engineer’s home lab and the door is hanging off its hinges, you wouldn’t have much confidence in their work. As for the redirect? It’s just good practice. Too many entities monitoring, censoring, injecting plain HTTP. And with popular browsers starting to mark HTTP as insecure, why would you go through the effort of setting up HTTPS and still have some users receive a subpar experience?
Poetry is a new tool to help you manage your Python projects. It is both a dependency management tool and a packaging tool. Note that for the moment the focus is on the dependency management part and once it’s considered stable the work on the packaging part will begin. Most of the reasons why I started this are detailed in the README (along with why I don’t want to use Pipenv) but if you want to know the advantages of Poetry compared to existing tools, here are a few: * Exhaustive dependency resolver * Intuitive CLI (See [Commands](https://github.com/sdispater/poetry#commands)) * Emphasis on semantic versioning and constraint specification so that wildcard dependencies (`*`) will be considered bad practice * Support for dependencies caret, tilde, wildcard, inequality and multiple requirements. * Only one file `poetry.toml` which aims at being readable and clear * Mandatory compatible python versions specification. This project is a revamped version of [pypoet](https://github.com/sdispater/poet) to have a cleaner codebase. Be aware that not all the features described in the README are implemented yet. Basically only the dependency management and installation is implemented for now. Also, Poetry is Python 3.6+ only but can manage Python 2 projects without any problem. And finally, Poetry is not stable yet so internally things can change but the CLI and commands are pretty much stable so backwards-incompatible changes should not happen too often.
Try adding "while" and "break" somewhere along your code... It looks like you could figure out where they'd go...
global t may work too.
Sounds like you might want to just work with raw OpenGL here. PyOpenGL is the low level binding, there might be higher level wrappers around it.
Subprocess.Popen and use nohup?
 wing ide is a nice one something to try as an alternative to pycharm
I think Ansible works in cases like this by bootstrapping itself: i.e. it just writes a new Python script, which it then calls through `nohup` or something like that. Maybe not the prettiest solution, but it will work.
&gt;But first, I’d like to ask that you do not use the information below as an excuse to be unkind to anyone, whether new learners or experienced Python programmers. Many people have used Python very happily for years without fully understanding the distinction I’m about to explain. *Somebody* is going to look at this and think it makes a great interview question and that makes me sad.
&gt; https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#typesseq Apparently, `list`, `tuple`, `range`, `bytes`, `bytearray`, `str` (and possibly a few more) produce sequence objects. They can be indexed and don't get consumed like iterators. 
Awesome! I'll take it for a spin tonight after work :D
print("ur mom gay")
Yes that makes me sad too. If folks who teach Python for a living mix this stuff up, it's ridiculous to expect a job candidate to understand this well.
Use `subprocess.Popen(..., shell=True)` and you can call your script with `nohup` as you want. For security reasons, Python doesn't default to allowing subprocesses to execute shell commands. 
To build on this answer, using a diskcache for your requests can save you from accidentally sending too many and getting throttled (or banned) by the API. This is especially important during development when you may be making frequent calls back to back. Here's an [example](https://github.com/Duroktar/Wolf/blob/master/images/diskcache_example.png) of how to write a simple wrapper around your requests to prevent this (set the [timeout](http://www.grantjenks.com/docs/diskcache/api.html#diskcache.DjangoCache.add) accordingly to prevent getting stale data, especially if the endpoint updates its resources frequently)

Why should core devs put their time on QT integration? This is obviously a userland project.
Using the wrong language to create a desktop app is a niche. Like /u/patrys said Python would not be the language most devs pick to build a windows UI application. Why not pick c# if you build for windows? Why not have python as a backend and have Electron as a frontend for the desktop? If you still insist of using python, then you have to build more yourself.
you remind me of a term frequently used on reddit called neckbeard. People with half the knowledge but all the pomp. This place seems like a cult than a discussion subreddit. Anything against Python is down voted.
I did figure it out but now I can't figure out how to make an error code when someone tries to withdraw money they don't have

Remove Anaconda from your PATH variable. You say you're new so I'm sorry if this is patronising, I don't know how new you are, but this is what you need to do: * Open a Terminal window. * If you're on bash (the default Terminal on a Mac) then open `~/.bashrc` in a text editor, e.g. run `nano ~/.bashrc` in Terminal, or Atom or VS Code or whatever you usually use * If you're on zsh the file to open will be `~/.zshrc`. If you don't know what zsh is don't worry about it. * There will be a line that looks something like `export PATH="/anaconda2:$PATH"`. I can't be sure exactly what it says for you, but "export," "anaconda2" and "PATH" will all be in there somewhere. * Delete that line. * Save and close the file. That's Ctrl+O then Ctrl+X if you're in nano on a Mac * Restart Terminal and you should be good.
But can it also be solved down to only blurple and only yellow sides?

There are places to play code golf. Newbie threads are definitely not. Calling code golf "optimized" is very misleading for a newbie, they will think that clever one-liners are good python code. Save them for challenge websites. I'm sure you have good intentions. But I don't think you are being helpful. Side note, your first code uses ``random_var`` inside the main, it should be outside to emulate OP's intentions.
Numerous options including: 1. Double fork (there is a daemonize library that will do this for you in python) 2. Implement a signal handler for sighup 3. Use a system tool like nohup or disown 4. Some options to popen Basically it depends on who you want to do the setup, the caller or the callee.

Hi, Could you explain more? I tried reading it but I didn't really understand what it was I had to do for it to work? 
Probably beefhook them, JK. I would use my python script I created to spam their phone lines completely rendering them useless.
Qt. At least on Linux Tk looks and feels like something from the `90s
Both are good, you can get qt creator for the graphical stuff, then convert it to python and give it the functionality you need with pyqt. Maybe Qt is more complete in my opinion.

I can agree with the problems you pointed out about Pipenv, especially with Pipfile is just a more fancy requirements.txt Hope this takes off, I’ll definitely check it out.
Btw, I didn't intend to be too rude or discourage you. Thing is, it's better if you research a bit and find out things for yourself. If you don't have a good book or tutorial to read, I recommend "Python Crash Course" (from no starch press). You could also check online "Learn Python the Hard Way", though I don't quite like as much as before now that there are so many good books on learning python -- but it's online and free.
I've never used it on Linux, but looks like there's instructions for installing it here: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/linux

I’m guessing your script is named numpy.py. Rename it to something else. 
read the sidebar post in the correct subreddit format your code properly for reddit (add 4 spaces before each line of code)
I'm sorry but I don't really understand what you mean, could you explain in a little bit more detail?
Nice! I’ve been holding off of pipenv exactly for reasons of it not feeling quite right.
Very neat. I tried running your code, and it worked... sorta. It doesn't animate smoothly. It's like it undershoots or overshoots, then snaps. Example: https://imgur.com/a/EWnaJ

The backend for this, RtMidi, refuses to build on windows in the current anaconda environment without Visual C++ 2014... a version that does not exist (there is 2013 and 2015, no 2014).
But you can select other backends with this library, so you might have more luck with another? 
first thing to do is more research, and realize that a much better website for scraping is simpler, such as https://www.basketball-reference.com/ use a library such as BeautifulSoup to read the website and look for key tags and refs in the page source to pull.

Are you sure? I just ran the code myself and without that line it returns an empty list. Are you using the interpreter or running the python file? If you are in the interpreter are you running the line f100=fib2(100) after you redefine the function and print the result? 
I was not using an interpreter, just running py. File.py in powershell
thanks. i'm well aware of bball ref. idk i guess i was leaning towards the other site because i want to be looping through a lot of games. it seemed like the format of the url's on stats.nba would be easier to loop through. for example for bball ref for a particular game it ends with date+home team. but i'm not super familiar with grabbing a lot of box scores so idk if there is a more efficient way to do this.
It worked the same for me both ways, but it confused be bc this is how the setup was for the tutorial. A guy just mentioned about running it out of the interpreter instead of a file. What would change from doing that?
If the page depends on JavaScript to pull in data after the page has loaded, then you won’t be able to easily use scraper tools that depend on having all the data in the source (requests, pyquery, beautiful soup, scrapy, etc). Instead, you’ll need to use a headless browser that can pass off the rendered DOM to another tool like selenium or pyquery. 
No worries I am just trying to nail down your actual question. Are you saying it's the same when you use result.append(a) As when you use result = result + a Or are you saying it is the same when you use either of those as it is to when you use neither? 
I think I'm missing something on account of the fact that the python website probably doesn't put redundant commands in their tutorials.
Sorry I am on mobile, [a] is correct. Not including either of those lines will make the function return an empty list. Including either of the lines will print what maldio had in their answer. If that is not true, it's something other than the actual code causing that. 
Hmm. I wonder what it could be. Does the latest version of python automate this feature if you return a results list without appending?
This isn't python but have a look at Electron. https://electronjs.org/
This project has lock files. The "bad design decision" is not locking file versions. It's including environment markers in the lock file (e.g. the version of the OS where the lock file was generated). There's no reason to include that information.
I believe it's because in the interactive interpreter a blank line is needed to terminate a function, so If you put a blank line after the function it will work fine interactively: e.g.: &gt;&gt;&gt; def fib2(n): ... result = [] ... a,b=0,1 ... while a&lt;n: ... result.append(a) ... a,b=b,a+b ... return result ... &gt;&gt;&gt; f100=fib2(100) &gt;&gt;&gt; print (f100) [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89] If you do not, the interactive interpreter chokes: &gt;&gt;&gt; def fib2(n): ... result = [] ... a,b=0,1 ... while a&lt;n: ... result.append(a) ... a,b=b,a+b ... return result ... f100=fib2(100) print (f100) File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 8 f100=fib2(100) ^ SyntaxError: invalid syntax &gt;&gt;&gt; print (f100) Traceback (most recent call last): File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt; NameError: name 'f100' is not defined &gt;&gt;&gt; KeyboardInterrupt 
you have to be missing something. Python never assumes what you want to return from a function or anything about how you want to transform the data. Delete all the commented out code, etc from the function so you can be sure you're looking at only the lines you intend to function. with this function definition, you *will* get an empty list. def fib2(n): result = [] a, b = 0, 1 while a &lt; n: a, b = b, a+b return result the only way to explain what you're saying is either: * you're function isn't what you think it is (you've commented out the wrong line or something) * you're printing the wrong output or calling the wrong function (if there's multiple of the functions defined, are you *certain* you're not using the same name twice, or calling the wrong one, etc?) 
Here's a working example, because I'm bored :) https://gist.github.com/kevbo/d0287c2868cd9cf0a9e4bb6aa47b2342
The best thing to do when writing functions is convert the sequence you get into an iterator right away (if you can), and clearly document whether it can take iterators. When passing iterators to functions, obviously you should assume that the iterator is consumed and no longer usable. --- Somewhat relevant: [`itertools.tee`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.tee) Tees are not a solution to the problem of side-effects when passing iterators to functions -- you might as well just create a list -- but they are still handy tools for managing the statefulness of iterators and could be useful when writing such functions. 
Side note, while statistically it's likely I am a guy, it's not polite to assume I am. In this case, I am not. 
I'm a bit confused about the motivation here. It starts out saying that bash and make are somehow "wonky". Then the author proceeds to define a whole bunch of helper functions in order to be able to run basic shell commands in the final example. If this was written in bash it would be a very straight forward script, just a plain list of commands, really, and certainly shorter and more readable than that whole mess. 
Hey NotSureTheNameWillFi, no, there are no compile errors in the logs. Actually I don't even see that he tries to compile the _struct.c file. I've found something online that seems to be similiar to my problem: https://bugs.python.org/issue28444 But the patches are for python 3. Maybe it is the same problem for python 2.7.13
I mean, it's just a few features from Fabric with different names though.. 
Pretty much. I'm just exploring ideas here. I wrote about my own motivations for wanting to just write out those functions I needed myself instead of relying on fabric myself, but it's more just for the sake if discussion/argumentation. People should use what best suits themselves and their team. If that's fabric, great. If not, that's ok too. I think the motivations for moving away from fabric will be clearer in parts 2 and 3, especially, where we see how we can make our development tools [part of our package's cli](https://github.com/knowsuchagency/python-package-template/blob/master/%7B%7Bcookiecutter.project_slug%7D%7D/%7B%7Bcookiecutter.project_slug%7D%7D/cli.py#L29) when installed in editable mode.

I was waiting for the genius line. Never came. 
`range` is not special. It's just an iterable. It's easy to make your own version of `range` in pure Python.
You're right the examples in the article are trivial; I just wanted to demonstrate the syntax. A better example, perhaps, is the [command I use to generate my documentation with sphinx and have it rendered on github for new projects](https://github.com/knowsuchagency/python-package-template/blob/master/%7B%7Bcookiecutter.project_slug%7D%7D/run.py#L341), which is a lot more cumbersome to write in BASH -- speaking from experience. I plan to write about this stuff more in part 2/3. Granted, others may prefer to BASH all the things, and if that works for you, then great. I prefer to stay in Python-land where possible. @main.command() def publish_docs(): """ Compile docs and publish to GitHub Pages.

Interesting, using a dictionary I could also take advantage of the serialized data created from my models as well methinks?
Actually, the page I borrowed the logic from has a much nicer bash script than what was there before; so this may not be the best example anymore
Hi again Johnny. In this specific case, when you open that website, you get json info from [this url](https://data.nba.com/data/5s/v2015/json/mobile_teams/nba/2017/scores/00_todays_scores.json) every 10 seconds or so. Just using `data = json.loads(resp.text)' and you get the dictionary with the data, no need even `beautifulsoup`. Information about games if you have the ID, [this url](https://stats.nba.com/stats/boxscoresummaryv2?GameID=0021700718), similar to the first one. GameIDs look like consecutive integers, so you can iterate with `GameID=0021700718`, `GameID=0021700719`, `GameID=0021700720`...
Thanks for the answer and the links, it was really helpful! Next time I‘ll make sure to ask in r/learnpython 
No its okay! Its just a support bot so it would be answering simple questions for the user. That's what I was wondering, should I be storing the responses and inputs in classes? Like would it be good to say: "if input is in some queryset then reply with a response from this queryset"?
Might give it a shot, I don't get calls from Africa in general so I might just block all of them

Why did I choose to post this to /r/Python? I think Nim might be of great interest to Python programmers who would like to explore other languages which provide more speed than Python. (that was how I discovered Nim) Why Nim (and not something else) for Pythonistas? It uses significant whitespace, and its syntax is very Python-like, while providing C-like speeds. I have been using it for last couple of months and was pleasantly surprised. It takes a week or two to get used to it, but after that you can be very productive. If you want to compare Nim and Python, take a look at [my AoC 2017 repo](https://github.com/narimiran/AdventOfCode2017), where you can compare syntax differences/similarities, and see the differences in speed between these two languages.
Is this a joke?
I hope you don‘t bother me asking another question. Is it possible with this code to change the i to a space? So the code is executed per each space, not per item in the input? print(''.join([secondary[" "] for " " in user_input])) So basically like this? Obv. it doesn‘t work.
That's kind of my point. Maybe I didn't make it clear enough, but I'm actually trying to advocate against using build tools and just writing your own thin wrappers around any bash commands if you're building a Python project. It's not reinventing the wheel, IMO. It's showing that the wheel is already there in the stdlib
How so? Is it better to just use bash scripts, make, fabric, or some other tool for the tasks you commonly associate with a particular project? I'm not arguing this is the "right way", if there is such a thing. I'm just curious about your experience.
No
What about supervisor?
https://github.com/gboeing/osmnx
That sounds like a tool for me xD
It certainly looks interesting to me. I love the idea that it compiles to C and JavaScript. I play with Python at home because it's the language I use at work and I'm sometimes disappointed when I get something cool done and I realize I can't easily share it with non-techies because it's python. Also I miss macros from C and generics from C++. I've never really liked Python's version of Classes/Objects. Thanks for posting!
Depends on the kind of snake you're afraid of.
I see. Have a look at this, I think you'll like it: https://github.com/kennethreitz/delegator.py
Thanks for the tip. I've been aware of delegator in the past, as with most of Kenneth's awesome projects. What I'm writing about in the article is intentionally much dumber, and I'm ok with people thinking it's a bad idea.
Yeah we haven't heard about this one before.
Are you doing things is an overly-complicated way? Don't simplify! Add another layer!
Strings have a `split` method that without any arguments will split at whitespace and return a list. Ex `'Feel the magic'.split()` returns `['feel', 'the', 'magic']`
It's the third link in the sidebar. Thanks for sharing. It's a great course and it's highly recommended.
Thanks, haven’t seen that.
As in a legitimate phobia of snakes? Python was named after Monty Python, so the references you’ll see most often are to those skits/jokes. However, the community does like to plaster actual pythons on the covers of books and such, so if just seeing a picture of a snake causes you discomfort, I would avoid it. 
No
Go for it. I think you'll enjoy it.
&gt; Ultimately, I just don't like writing bash scripts, tbh. I can 100% sympathize with that for complicated use cases. But in many cases, like the examples you gave, you're basically just wrapping the lines of a trivial shell script in your own `shell(…)` function, which is hardly an improvement. Especially since many of the commands you're executing that way actually have their own Python equivalents, like `os.remove()` or `shutil.rmtree()`.
also, it looks like mpv dosent seem to support fbcon at all: https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/issues/5231 
This is the post I was looking for.
Hm.. mpv does support DRM and its possible to use DRM on the Pi with the PiTFT via TinyDRM though going through the process of setting up the Pi for this might just be too much effort to be worth it, I'll let you be the judge: https://medium.com/@meghana.madhyastha/outreachy-setting-up-raspberry-pi-3-bfe53f9d15c8
&gt;rubix ^I'm ^sorry
probably not, pretty much all projects in python are based on herpetology (study of snakes) and most python libraries are serpent based. you'll find that almost all python projects are something like drawing snake animations, snake-focused games, todo web apps for a user to keep track of snake based tasks, etc, so probably not a good language if you're ssscared of sssnakes.
And Python/Pandas/PyPlot is extraordinarily well documented online. Having worked both with VBA-Excel-Access and Python, the different is impressive. Still, from time to time I still use Excel in the very last step, because graphing is a bit more hands-on.
/r/learnpython or stack Overflow are better options for support on this. Good luck :)
 import snake as not_snake
You’ll gain a lot from learning python. Reading/writing excel is fairly easy but the main advantage is analyzing the data with python has been far more productive.
Depend if you afraid of solid snake or real snake 
You want pandas. It's amazing.
Python's official logo is two snakes, so its not just a community thing...
What you're talking about sounds like NLP (natural language parsing). There are many services you can leverage to do this for you like Microsoft's LUIS (https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/language-understanding-intelligent-service/ for example) or you can try to roll your own with something like NLTK (https://www.nltk.org). Most of the time when I'm writing bit integrations, I follow the same pattern as Click(http://click.pocoo.org) where I will write a plug-in system and then parse the input and pass context to the sub command.
Just a side-note; `lst.append(el)` is slightly different from `lst = lst + [el]`. &gt;&gt;&gt; lst = [] &gt;&gt;&gt; def app(x): &gt;&gt;&gt; lst.append(x) &gt;&gt;&gt; return lst &gt;&gt;&gt; print(app(1)) [1] &gt;&gt;&gt; print(app(2)) [1,2] # reset for pluseq &gt;&gt;&gt; lst = [] &gt;&gt;&gt; def pluseq(x): &gt;&gt;&gt; lst = lst + [x] &gt;&gt;&gt; return lst &gt;&gt;&gt; lst = [] &gt;&gt;&gt; print(pluseq(1)) Traceback (most recent call last): File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt; File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 2, in pluseq UnboundLocalError: local variable 'lst' referenced before assignment This is a really persnickety point (the above only occurs because it's bad code), but if it saves you from pulling your hair out because you were taught the wrong thing about how python works then it'll be worth it.
I view the Python officials as part of the Python community. I’m not blaming any group for anything, it didn’t even occur to me that the theme of Python might be an issue for some people. But I guess it makes sense since snake phobias do exist.
My apologies. No offense intended.
This maybe a option: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDEOWLHYVo&amp;t=4s 
Mostly agreed, in Pythion I feel OP would be better suited using a list.
I have a tree structure . That is `p = p.next` is more like `p = get_best_suited_child(p)`.
I think a linked list basically behaves like an iterator. If you build your class so that it can become iterable, you can use standard python conventions. For loops. List comprehension, etc.... for item in p: print(item) 
I tried to make the question the simplest, where it lost some context. The traversal is over a tree, where I choose the best fitting child on each step (or I go up the tree to the first parent).
I was a fan of pypoet and, now, poetry. I really hope this takes off in the community! &gt; This project is a revamped version of pypoet to have a cleaner codebase. At first I couldn't tell this wasn't pypoet (names too similar; not paying too close attention). Any further details of how this is different? &gt; Also, Poetry is Python 3.6+ only but can manage Python 2 projects without any problem. How come Python 3.6 is required?
How did you get to that last url? Is there a way to get the same thing with the actual box score contents in it? Either the traditional box score or some of the others (advanced, four factors, etc.)?
Is it just me or does it feel like each serves different roles. - I feel like `poetry` really shines at development. - `pipenv` shines at deployment but feels like it just adds to the madness of files and tools for development.
Thank you very much. I'll take a look at this but I guess from what I understand now is that Selenium can be rather slow, particularly if I need to repeat this process for thousands of games?
Here is a some code to play with: class Node: def __init__(self, d, p=None, c=None): self.data = d self.parent = p self.children = c a, b, c, d, e = Node('a'), Node('b'), Node('c'), Node('d'), Node('e') b.parent = a c.parent = a a.children = [b, c] d.parent = c e.parent = c c.children = [d, e] x = e last = None # is there a better way to do this? while x: last = x x = x.parent print(last.data) y = a last = None # is there a better way to do this? # is there a better way to do this? while y.children: y = y.children[-1] print(y.data) 
Hi interesting read, are you the author of it? May I ask you some question about a bit more complex Data Visualization?
&gt; some of the more exotic features like user-defined operators are not very close to the Python mentality https://docs.python.org/2/reference/datamodel.html#special-method-names : *"This is Python’s approach to operator overloading, allowing classes to define their own behavior with respect to language operators."*
See my comment [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/81ejxc/is_there_a_python_functional_idiom_for_traversing/dv2mgip/). Does this help? Note that I have only captured the gist of what I am doing as it is part of a fairly large project.
Why on the class? Isn't what I am doing fairly generic?
I don't think anything is fundamentally wrong with what you are doing, I think I'd make a linked_list class or a tree class, and implement the behavior in the class, so that it is cleanly callable from outside. Your approach seems more procedural than OO.
It feels bad to put the behavior on the class since the behavior is rather generic, and can be applied to any class that can be used to form a tree structure. Hence looking for a better idiom.
I’m too lazy to edit 
Who cares if you think he should or should not be using linked lists. He didnt ask that, maybe someone else is requiring him to use it, maybe his dev team is requiring iy. He didnt ask IF he should, he asked another question.
Because using something that's not a linked list (i.e. a plain Python list) would automatically solve OP's issue.
You could have `iter_parents` and `iter_children` methods on your `Node` class that are generators. Then you can implement whatever you want in terms of those.
It is about time to scrap Instagram.
I would recommend using the simpler sites, they are friendly towards scraping, and importantly won't change or update graphics which will break your scraper a lot of times. Looking at bball ref, it seems even simpler since the url extension for games on a certain date is: /boxscores/?month=2&amp;day=1&amp;year=2018 (Feb 1, 2018 is shown here) All the games are in div class game_summaries, and then the teams are designated by loser or winner within their own table and you could also pull the stat leaders. Using this with beatifulSoup should work pretty well once you parse the HTML, you can basically say retrieve all game summaries, and then one by one go through them and pick them out. You can cycle through dates, wrong dates will only show ("No games played today")
Thanks, much appreciated!
Are you that dense? Again, maybe the CHOICE in data structure is not his to make.
I'm not "dense". "I'm forced to use a linked list" is a valid answer to my question.
Indeed, I understand where you are coming from, but it feels like polluting the object to put a fairly generic method as a method of that class.

Good bot, 6 more to go.
&gt; I know it is nit picky but saying matlab isn't applicable to your data makes you sound ... silly. That makes you sound like an asshole. u/PanFiluta may have meant "too powerful" or maybe just made a mistake, but you sound condescending. This is a prime example of how people get frustrated and turned off by learning how to code. u/PanFiluta, there's also r/learnpython to consider. And yes, you're 100% correct about Python being a better general purpose language than R or Matlab. If you ever need to automate tasks outside of your analytical work, Python will serve you well.

I am not saying to add it to the node. I am saying you should add it to a class that you have not implemented, or at least haven't shared. IMO, what you are doing is not generic. You are traversing a tree and under certain circumstances traversing one way or the other. I would wrap that up in a unique class that owns the tree, owns the logic for deciding which branch to take, and owns the logic for making that single step.
The frequency of [XY questions](http://mywiki.wooledge.org/XyProblem) on forums like this sub are extremely high.
Wouldn't it make more sense to say it was built using Beautiful Soup? Flask isn't really doing anything to scrape Instagram... at all.
I don't think so. Since you have the same lock mechanism you can use it to pin the dependencies of your project for deployment.
Go to /r/learnpython
What general area are you interested in? Data? Sysadmin? Math? Visualization? Games? Maybe give some project ideas and we can weed out the hard ones. 
Basically, I wanted to rewrite it with a much cleaner codebase which would ease external contribution. As to why Python 3.6, it's just that I wanted to take advantage of the latest addition of the language (like type annotations and f-strings) and, most importantly, I didn't want to manage the compatibility issues between Python 2 and Python 3.
Are you just getting the text "5.00ft" on the image?
Lots of information in the sidebar
&gt; I play with Python at home because it's the language I use at work I also use Python for work, and for most of my weekend-projects. After discovering Nim and seeing how easy is to port Python code to Nim, I've been doing toy projects much less in Python. As for 'coding for work', I find Nim too young and its ecosystem is still small (but compared to Python's, everything is ;)) so currently I'm a bit afraid to use it for anything serious, but I guess this might change as I become more proficient in it. (There are (braver) people using Nim already for serious stuff)
Make "*get_best_suited_child*" function a member of p, make p iterable, so that consecutive calls go deeper into the tree. Then you can just do this: for c in p.get_best_suited_child(): do_something(p)
I’m interested in AI so I’d like so move in that direction but I know it’s a complicated area so it’s unlikely I’d be able to start there.
Thank you very much, I’ll check that sub out.
Thank you for reminding me of the sidebar. I’m typically on mobile so it slips my mind.
You will not regret using Python with Excel. Whether you use Pandas or some of the other packages, you will expand your capabilities for creating and reproducing spreadsheet data, and render it into other forms.
It doesn't really matter if you start with something too difficult, you will still learn a lot, you just won't finish the project, but that is ok. Some ideas: A calculator with shunting yard algorithm, snake or pong game, multy layer perceptron, Mandelbrot set explorer. Have fun!
My bad!
Yeah don't worry it was a joke
Modified that code to fit in for my purposes and worked pretty smoothly. Thanks a lot!
You can parallelize it using Docker, https://github.com/vivint/selenium-docker I've also added browser pools with caching that should make scraping a single site much faster.
I've revisited Nim dozens of times, still waiting for a proper IDE support. I also hate how imports are handled; which may be solvable with a proper IDE.
Cool, my line plot made it in there. :-)
Seems solid, but wow that's complicated. tldr; use Anaconda
*scraper
ahh, yes, that's probably it. I used 2 (cause I'm at work and we're a python 2 shop), I'll try 3. 
I think the idea people are pointing at here is that instead of creating a list or tree that can be walked up and down to find objects, maybe it'd be better to create a container that yields objects. Whatever algorithm goes into selecting objects would then be the responsibility of that object and entirely transparent to the caller. It seems like you expect a given tree to yield a single result... but if you expected it to give a sequence you could easily implement the iterator protocol and loop over the thing directly, use it in generators, etc... 
I will like to learn how to visualize more tables(DataFrames) with similar data in one Graph or Plot. For Example I got 20 Tables one for each Nation and in every table I got max 10 entries: 1 column is "score" and one his label "Sport type". If this was pandas 20 Dataframe with 2 DataSeries each. Of couse I can diplay it easly as 20 Bar/Column Histogramms. What if I want all the data in 1 Plot?
I appreciate what you are trying to do, and I agree that pipenv has some problems that don't really address why package management in python is painful. However, I don't think adding in another packaging library at this point is the right move. One of the biggest problems with packaging in python is fragmentation. We have distutils, setuptools, pip, easyinstall, pipenv and more. People are still shipping setup.py files that are distutils dependant and recommending you install their packages with easyinstall. What python needs most right now is a single standard for package management that will pull together the functionality provided by all the legacy management tools. While it is flawed, I think pipenv can do that. I think resources are better spent improving pipenv and pushing people towards using it. We need to solve the fragmentation problem first and then iterate on better ways of doing things. So, even if your package is elegant and has a good philosophical foundation and is easier to use than pipenv (all of which appear, at first glance, to be true), I won't use it or recommend it. Because, unless somehow you magically get majority adoption and pipenv is deprecated, the fragmentation problem in the python packaging ecosystem has just gotten worse.
Because classes provide magic methods to use them with iteration.
Last time I checked nim not only had a default return variable which I find a bit dangerous but also a default return value for some types (0 for int If i remember well) which I find crazy.
You're welcome. FWIW, it's a long story, but I was a math major in school and I was convinced that I couldn't write code. The unfortunate part of that is that it took me years to muster up the courage/gumption/whatever to get my career in software up off the ground. I've been working in the industry for nearly 2 decades now and I love it. I'm hardly a genius but I do good work. I'd dabbled in several languages here and there, it was actually Python which helped me get over the mental hump and prove (to myself) that I could do this work professionally. All that being said, Python isn't perfect for everything, but neither is R or Matlab. 
Is python your first language or do you have some prior experience programming? Id look into tensorflow
I would like to mention that I asked for an idiom for a common enough pattern. Not _how to solve_ a particular question, but rather _how to solve it better_.
no nothing at all, its just not showing any indication of measuring any distance or anything extra, it basically just runs without it. If i remove the code ive added for measuring distance from the script, it would still run and give the same results: i.e. a frame streaming live feed from the picamera opens which if it sees the colour blue in its view it puts a red spot in the centre of it and if it moves then it tracks it around. Im thinking i need to somehow change the structure of the code somwhere or maybe add/move a few lines about maybe but not sure :/ 
Just so I understand your data correctly: For every Nation, you have information about their "score" and what "Sport type" that "score" is for. If that's right, I would firstly recommend combining those 20 DataFrames into a single DataFrame and add a column "Nation" to indicate the Nation that the "score" and "Sport type" correspond to. Working with multiple DataFrames can be nasty; and having your data structured properly in a single DataFrame can make your work much, much easier. In terms of plots, certainly a heatmap as /u/InDirectX4000 suggested could work. It all depends on what you're trying to show or explore about the data. You could group the data by Nation and/or Sport type and look at the distribution of scores. If you structure the data as I suggested above, you could do that with pandas with the line `nation_sports_scores_df.groupby(['Nation', 'Sport type']).boxplot()`. That's just one example.
I get ya :) I studied high school specialized on IT (in our country, it would be an equivalent of US college I guess), but I hated it. So I went another direction. Through med school and burnout and a new career in a hotel, after 10 years, I'm back to coding, and I really enjoy it. But I'm not sure if I would like 100% software focus. I really like the fact that I get a bit of that and a bit of that :) maybe in slow steps, I'll follow your direction as well... at the moment, I'm just glad I can look like a wizard to my colleagues and make their 10 hour projects automated and have them done in 30 minutes...
Linked lists may be common in CS in general, but I do not think they are common in python. Hence why there isn't a common python-esque idiom.
I understand your point. But settling for a flawed tool just because of the adoption will only bring pain points in the future, I think, and possibly the emergence of a yet another tool to solve the issues brought by it. I think poetry can make a difference at this point since pipenv is relatively new and even though it is gaining traction it does not appear to be vastly adpoted in the Python community for now. So I think it's a good time for a library like poetry to come out. And, in my opinion, pipenv won't be the go-to tool for Python project management simply because its goal is mainly leveraging the new Pipfile file for dependency management. The packaging is not something it will provide.
Knowledge is its own reward.
&gt; waiting for a proper IDE support I use VS Code, and there is a Nim extension. It is not as good as Python extension, and it has some quirks, but I would rate it 5/7. I don't know how is the situation with other editors/IDEs.
Yes you got it right and yes I agree with the fact that Heatmap could be a good choice but not in my case, cause for me it s important to show what sport types are the "best"/"worst" for each nation and I want the user to be able to easily understand what nation is the best at Sport-type X but also what is the best Sport-type for nation X. I will definitely try to make 1 dataset and see how your solution works out. In any case thank you both for the help. If this works out you will probably see some of this on r/DataIsBeautifull or on this sub :)
I have really limited knowledge from an HTML web design class I took like 5 years ago. I’ll keep tensorflow in mind.
I just found out that if you offset the letter squares with the voxels faces you get this interference and highlighting effect and it looks way cooler now, https://i.imgur.com/SyLBA1a.gif
Both. VBA is great for working with Excel directly. But, Python is much simpler for many data tasks (fellow VBAer if that matters).
Are you absolutely sure this is the code you are running? I've frequently found I'm editing the wrong file. Put some `print('hello`)`s around and see where it stop executing.
There is a really nice section in “automate the boring stuff with python” on sending emails. A pdf version of the book is available for free, but it’s an excellent resource that is totally worth buying.

I'm all about reducing keystrokes. This lets me search for and play items from a certain popular torrent archive without leaving the terminal, when paired with [peerflix](https://github.com/mafintosh/peerflix) and mpv. If someone else has made a similar program, I'm all for discussion, but I made this in ten minutes to fill this gap in the programs I had installed after a one minute search came up fruitless. Code style comments are welcomed, thank you.
This is great thanks for sharing! Just one question - I noticed that functions were defined for each plot. Is it possible to use these without functions? 
I’m playing with a webscraper. In reality, it means I’m doing as much work learning html/css as I am coding. It’s really interesting building a project with real world usage as opposed to an assigned project from a learning method.
That’s an interesting project. I may look at doing something similar once I finish my webscraper. I may try and make a random encounter generator or something like that. 
Well then instead of trying to rush it even more, how about look at what you learned already and repeat it until it's obvious and easy?
I don't know why this doesn't have enough upvotes. Probably because people enjoy posting their entire project or not posting anything at all and adding generic "pls help" in the title and "dose not work1!!!one!!!" in the post itself...
By using it.
The fastest way to learn it, is probably to just read the documentation.
Looks like you are using 'blur' as a copy of 'image' (variable names), and rendering blur using the imshow function... You apply cv2.circle to the blur copy, but applied cv2.putText on the image copy. That's why you don't see any text. Replace image with blur as the first parameter on the putText call. Also don't call that variable blur, rename it to 'outputImage' maybe. 
[By doing](http://norvig.com/21-days.html).
Stop smoking weed.
Its a great library for deep learning once you get the basics down, ive seen people make a self learning AI driver for GTAV with it
This needs to be in the sidebar of any 'learn____' subreddit.
I directly used Tkinter and PyQt for the same gui. I started with TKinter, but stopped and changed to PyQt, because of some behaviour that 'should have worked', but didn't. It is annoying to read about PyQts methods and function, because the doc is C-only, but overall I had a faster workflow with PyQt.
...by practicing everyday.
Thanks for the advice! I can think of some, perhaps most importantly it would give us access to advanced tools like scikit learn, tensorflow and opencv with no extra cost to try out new concepts!? 
You know, when you were in school, you had lessons, and then exercises to practise what you had just learnt ? Most of the time, right after the lesson, you had simple exercises that asked you to just apply the lesson at a basic level, to get a solid grasp of the material, and the over time you had problems instead of basic exercises, where you had to think slightly more abstractly, to put things into context, and to connect the lesson with other things you learned before ? And then, some time after, you had an exam, which forced you to read your notes again, do some exercises again, so that everything new you were exposed to, you had to keep going back to it over the course of, say, a month ? And maybe sometimes you weren't there during the lecture, because you were sick or something, you asked a friend what did you do during the lessons, you read the material and it all made sense, but then during the exam you had trouble putting everything together because you hadn't done any practise ? Yeah... Reality is often boring, but drills are the only way to learn anything. Side-note, if you expect more specific advice from us, try to explain your situation a bit more. What is your level ? How are you learning right now ? Do you have programming experience already, or are you entirely new to it ? Are you coding some toy projects ? Learning a specific library ? So many important questions, but we only know that you want to learn quicker.
Thanks! That is most definitely a very good question, if the step to python is really justified when Matlab used predominantly. I’m thinking license cost and access to new and perhaps more advanced or diversed tools!? The drawback is of course user experience. However, I have made myself the Matlab - python crossover and it is not that terrible. In the end, an inviting, humble and balanced approach might do the trick!?
Yes. Learn pandas and you will be a good amongst analysts. 
Thanks! I will definitely have a demo! I totally agree, the key is to show new opportunities at the same not making it sound to harsh. I been a died hard Matlaber myself, but finding python and the excellent ecosystem opened up my mind a lot. To have the ability to do advanced analysis at the same time as having a complete programming language behind you make you become very productive! Something a found laking with Matlab.
I tried it and it returned an empty list like we thought it would! All is well now. Thanks for your help!
Hi all, As part of a larger project of mine I ended up discovering a method for creating interactive animation for parameter tuning. I did it in a way that allows me to produce the graph as quickly as possible which I found important when making lots of small tweaks to the model. If you would like to replicate what I did I wrote a small explination of the method used here: https://www.philiposbornedata.com/2018/03/01/creating-interactive-animation-for-parameter-optimisation-using-plot-ly/ In short, I forced my data into an animation example from the Plot.ly website and, after a few small layout changes, it works pretty well. Hope you find this interesting. Thanks 
Really good comments! Thanks! I’ve been thinking along the same lines but needed confirmation:) Batch scripting and multiprocessing is within reach compared to Matlab and the parallel-toolbox which adds to the spending account. Dask seems to be an interesting alternative! I think a major pros is the free no cost point together with actively being used and developed in industry. Do you have any examples of companies using and contributing to for instance numpy? 
Thanks! Will do! Most of the items finished but need to do the demo and the report!
I hacked on it a bit more now that it's working, to change the text (to my name) and palette, then did some FFMPEG magic to make it look even lower resolution: https://twitter.com/Foone/status/969685986455183360 You might want to see how I redid the letters, by embedding them as text in the source: https://gist.github.com/foone/bb2feb15a222fd3f5ed5f19d09f1ee52 
Find something that interests you the most, for example: I love crypto trading and I found API for an exchange and now I have few ideas for using that api. Also, In beginning i really struggled with Python, so I found a mentor, we meet 3 times a week over Skype and I work with him one on one, he gives me tasks, teaches me etc.. It can be expensive but well worth it Good Luck!
This depends very heavily of Django admin being in use.
Do you mean that by using grappelli, for example, this won’t work?
I literally have no clue what you want. Please consider posting this in a subreddit focused on the problem you are trying to solve. Python can probably do it, but you need a much firmer grasp of what it is you want before you can begin programming it. If you actually state your problem and what you aim to accomplish computationally we might be able to point you in the right direction. Of course we will point you in pythony directions whereas if you post this in a subreddit focused in the area of your interest you will probably get a better answer. 
If you see someone trying to open a door by hitting it with their head, it's natural to ask them why they are doing that.
http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/writing/structure/ ?
Depends on your target audience. If you to Automate some analysis and graphs and gain insights in general for yourself. Python + Pandas is my answer. If you need to make something that coworkers can use, well macros are probably the way. 
yeah absolutely this is the right code. From what i've gathered though, I think where i'm mainly going wrong is because the find_marker() function is supposed to be defined for finding both the marker in the image (to calculate focal length for camera calibration) and the colour blue. But i've only defined it for the image. I'm not so sure how to add the code so it knows to check for both. 
Thanks for your response. Thats interesting. I will try it out tomorrow and let you know what I get. Cheers! 
I'm not sure about grappelli, but 80% of my published Django projects don't have Django Admin enabled at all.
As mentioned, SMTPlib makes this real easy. http://naelshiab.com/tutorial-send-email-python/ Wrap it in a function and just use it whenever you need it. That's what I do, so I don't have to keep retyping it for various scripts. 
since computers are deterministic machines, you'll firstly need to specify What do I want to accomplish? Which algorithms are fitting? Make a diagram on how your informations shall be transformed through your program. Research if python and the libraries are capable of it, and / or you'll need to adjust our previous step. repeat the last two steps finally, write your python program. the pre programming phase should take approx. 1/2 of your time programming the actual code.
nah, go right ahead! I'm sure it could be simplified further, it's basically a bunch of hard coded matrices and an unrolled matrix multiplication, but I was trying to get something dumb done fast rather than something elegant. I'm sure you could leverage numpy and make it much simpler and better. 
my thoughts as well. I kept trying to do my `voxel_face` command more elegantly but it's really just swapping everything into the x-dimension, hard-coded logic in x, then swap back into the desired dimension. It'll probably be something along the same lines. 
try to make a clone of a simple program you use. ex. a calculator. then extend it, with, for ex. calculus or linear algebra features. 
I've been using it for 11 years. I still screw up an if-else list comprehension every time. Learning still means referencing.
lol
We've been talking about auto-generating letters for this on the matplotlib gitter and I posted your code, somebody alread [remixed it](https://bpaste.net/show/5e00c6fa3a64).
I love the idea of Graphql but hate that you cannot specify And/Or logic so seems a bit limited. 
I've taken another look about it and thought about your comments as well. It's true that one of the biggest disappointments with pipenv is that it doesn't really attempt to deal with package management at all. You still have the most grating problem in that arena: the need to have two different user-maintained files for dependencies: one for package dependencies (setup.py:install_requires) and one for application dependencies (requirements.txt/Pipfile.lock). And, it seems to be a well excepted anti-pattern to have setup.py depend on your Pipfile for package dependencies. So, yes, I absolutely see a place for a system like poetry. I just think there's a very steep hill to climb to gain acceptance in the (already embittered) community and I worry that it would contribute to fragmentation. That being said, I think I might try poetry out for a silly little app that I've been tinkering on to see how it handles use-cases that I run into all the time with my larger applications and packages.
I think you want [matplotlib PdfPages](https://matplotlib.org/api/backend_pdf_api.html#imatplotlib.backends.backend_pdf.PdfPages) 
This is BS - stealing OC and pretending its his own. Here's one thing he stole: https://pythonspot.com/matplotlib-bar-chart/
He's a scammer of some kind. Here's where he stole one of his charts. https://pythonspot.com/matplotlib-bar-chart/
I don't disagree. That said, you could specify a flag argument in your resolver functions do the logic on the server, but you're right, it isn't part of the query language itself.
Man does matplotlib make ugly charts by default. 
You're right, and "in real life", I think one should use the abstractions that the interpreter provides on top of the OS, when possible. I'm just trying to demonstrate some helpers one could use when they need to execute something in the shell, without needing to rely an external library or tool, or write a bash script.
understood, thank you for the clarification
It was actually Nimrod after an ancient king from the bible. That name is seen as a derogatory term in some places, so they shortened it to just Nim. Nimrud is an ancient city in Iraq (largely destroyed by ISIL) so there is probably some common root for the two names.
Not sure why people is downvoting this, it's an interesting 5 min security hole note.
I'm not talking about operator overloading, Nim goes a bit further than that and allows you to define completely new operators, not just assign a new behaviour to the standard ones. See https://nim-lang.org/docs/manual.html#lexical-analysis-operators
100% this. In fact, OP's example object, he's already most of the way to implementing an iterator - he's already got a `next` method. If his `next` method raises `StopIteration` when it's out of elements, and if he adds: def __iter__(self): return self He's got a complete iterator!

&gt; Brython Sound cool..Why did you chose `Brython` over conventional languages such as JS and AngularJS?
Some amount of performance isn’t tangible, necessarily. For example time to productivity, general productivity, or hiring ability.
A recursive call that requires parameters that the user shouldn't have to worry about, like an accumulator or array indexes, wrapped by a helper function that sets up those parameters.
Because, I've a good grip in Python and it would be such a experience..to learn about new technologies..
You should post this question over at r/learnpython as suggested in the sidebar. This isn't really a sub for learning the basics of Python or programming
`x in range(a, b, c)` looks a lot clearer than `a &lt;= x &lt; b and x - a % c = 0` though. 
Ok. Thanks!!
Good catch. An another good reason for never keeping the admin url on /admin. Put a uuid in front and bots can't bruteforce it. Copy paste it once and you'll get your browser autocomplete it for you when you type admin anyway.
Would it make more sense to use pyproject.toml for configuration since that's going to be the standard moving forward? I'm admittedly new to this so I could be completely wrong.
Hi! I’m pretty new to this whole thing, so I put is appreciated. I’ll see what I can do to improve the documentation over the weekend. Here are some basic instructions: First, be sure you have Python 3, NumPy, and colorspacious. You’ll need two things, a palette in .gpl format, and an image (png, jpeg, etc.) When you run main.py, you’ll get a prompt asking, “Where is the palette?” You’ll need to provide the file path to a valid .gpl file at this point. You can most likely drag and drop the file onto the terminal to accomplish this. Then, it will ask, “Where is the image?” Provide the image path. The program will then apply the palette to the image by finding the closest color in the palette for each pixel. The output image will be saved in the same directory as main.py as ‘output.png.’ (Colors in output image may be slightly off due to a bug I need to squash)
Why negatives wtf
I'll share the project in GitHub after few days 
&gt; I'm sorry but I know Matlab and using it here would be like bringing artillery to a fistfight. Then python would be like bringing an orbital weapons platform to an artillery fight. Wrote all of the code for my physics Ph.D. in Matlab. Unless you need something extremely specific (e.g. simulink), Python &gt; Matlab for numerical analysis, and Python &gt;&gt;&gt; Matlab as a general purpose programming langauge That being said, my general rule is that (once you know at least one high-level programming language well) excel only ever makes sense for analysis if you can do the thing you need in &lt; ~5 minutes (so really quick stuff). Otherwise it has always been better long-term to break out the big-boy tools.
Looks interesting.. Always wanted to figure out a way to convert pdfs to mp3 so I could listen to this.. Noticed a few things which I havent seen in most intro Python programming courses. How long have you working on this, and how did you pickup python?
No, you are right to mention pyproject.toml. And, actually, it is something that might be worth considering since it could lead to a better adoption of poetry. So, I will think about it and thanks for mentioning this :-) 
Yeah the histogram is stolen right from matplotlib docs as well. This is a shite article lol. 
Actually haven't done that yet... I actually just used those guides for packaging to make syncing my own tools between machines easier lol. I guess I just figured it might be helpful to someone else too. I could probably give publishing a try this weekend though if I have time.
I could be wrong but I think what they were referring to was defining a function inside another function. 
I agree. The old argument is "the dependencies for the app/library should be in setup.py and the dependencies for development should be in requirements.txt (which includes a `pip install -e .`)" but `Pipfile`/`Pipefile.lock` does away with that distinction. Either we need a modern version of `setup.py` of `pipenv` needs better interop with it. I opened an issue about it in the pipenv's github. It was a closed with "neat idea, we'll re-open when we have time". I thought "really? you're going to cycle back through **closed** issues for future work? come on...."
wat
Have you ever programmed before? I ask because python is literally the easiest possible language to get started in. First, install python. Sounds like you're using the packaged installer. Great choice. Always use the 64bit version, I mean you don't have to but why not. Next, copy past this into a file called hello_world.py print 'hello world' Now go to the terminal and traverse to the directory where that file exists. Run. This command python hello_world.py Congratulations! You're a programmer
Yep that’s what I meant 
The simplest way to start running python code is to just open the default development environment. (IDLE (Python 3.3 64 bit)). Then go to file -&gt; new. and start writing python code. Hit F5 to run the code.
print("hello world") Ftfy.. python 2 is dead
Try `pandas`. It’s a library for manipulating ‘DataFrame’s or tables of data. I think it comes with a built-in functions that create a data frame from html files. As the data changes every day, it is possible that you might want to programmatically acquire the html from the given url. `requests` is a simple library that handles that. 
Oh the horrors 
One thing you could do is to parse it with, say, BeautifulSoup, and work with the document tree it produces.
Did you add the python directory to your path variable? That may be why python isn't working.
Thank you for having an interest in my project. Let me introduce the project a little. Joytan converts CSV files to self-made audiobooks in MP3 and textbooks in PDF. For language learning, the CSV probably contains entry words such as those in a dictionary. (We use CSV because it's exportable to Anki and editable on cloud.) So, it doesn't convert PDF to MP3 and I have no idea how to do that, although the easiest way would be using PyPDF2 to read text from PDF and boto3 (Amazon Polly for text-to-speech) to save it as MP3. I learned a lot about Python and PyQt5 from Anki developed by dae and its add-ons by a number of developers. Everything is written in Python. Read code hundreds of times to find anything to improve my app. (As a result, the structure of my project is quite similar to Anki.) I'm working on the project for almost 6 months as a side project. The goal was to make a tool for creating audio/textbooks to polish my English skills. It was achieved. Now I'm distributing it to help others, especially language learners. I picked up Python because of ML but I'm sticking with it because coding in Python is fun, isn't it?
In a csv?
It's an excel - sorry for not mentioning this in my post
Usuallly it's when you'll only ever use the function from within another function or you're dynamically creating a function.
Check the sidebar; /r/learnpython 
i did some tricks and got it after some hour, quick question if i have a string ending with number how do i get the number? i am stuck
Try pandas.
you can use regular expression to match the number at the end of the string: `re.findall(r'\d*$', target_string)`
Thanks, I guess that makes sense!
Now put it in detail like this, with screenshots (of you know, the input image, output image so people know what it does and can compare it, if you put in a few completely different input/output image pairs...) on github... Maybe some of them could be part of documentation itselves, if something might be unclear to others and you can't explain it in detail. Nobody really cares if they don't know what to expect.
Is this satire I'm not getting? The article is completely unreadable.
what changed between when it worked and when it stopped working? Can you re-install datetime?
Nice post! I do like how it makes it pretty easy to make animations on how parameters change with time - arguably the hardest thing to explain to people. 1) Kinda curious, how did you get a python notebook to work in a blog? Don’t mess around with Jupyter notebooks but that looks pretty dope. 2) What made you choose plot.ly as your data viz tool? I’m old fashioned and use matplotlib for everything so I’m curious how someone who actually uses it thinks about it.
This is blogspam and a poor attempt at marketing. I've just reported it as spam
Pm’d you!
Love it ! Thanks. I have troubles with the REPL module however : up arrow should bring history up. backspace should erase a character... and so on... instead of adding random characters. Is it a wrong setting on my machine ?
Defaults have become better since version 2.0.
If looking for something simple, see https://yagmail.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
Thank you for your reply. The task is to change the index given to the string and attempting to predict the output of it. I think the solution is to convert the string to a list and replacing character(s) of the text, but, I am not quite sure if that is accurate as it would mean that the text of string will be modified itself. Hope to hear more answers from everyone :) 
Wait, when does a python script have dependencies for development that aren't needed for runtime? We aren't compiling binaries.
Whoa! Start again. This time explain what you're doing.
Thanks. Sorry for the late reply. I got fired already.
Tools such as pylint and bandit ( https://github.com/openstack/bandit ) that analyze your code. Not actual dependencies for the script itself to run, but still needed for development.
Gotcha, that makes sense.
where is his code?
I'm not entirely sure what you mean here, but reading between the lines a bit, I'm guessing you want to modify a string at a particular index. Eg. you have s = 'hullo' and want to, say, change the letter at index 1 to 'e', and get 'hello' Now, python strings are immutable, which means you can't directly modify them. Ie. s[1] = 'e' won't work. But what you can do is build up a **new** string from the old. Eg. another way of phrasing this is to say: - Make a string from everything before index 1, then an "e", then everything *after* index 2. You can do this with slicing, Eg. s2 = s[:1] + "e" + s[2:] (Slices are of the form [x:y] which means, "everything between position x and y 9 (not including y)" - if you leave x or y out, it means the start or end of the string. Alternatively, you could convert the string to something that **is** mutable, modify it, and then convert it back to a string. Eg. you mention in a comment about converting it to a list. Here you're still not modifying the original, but creating a new string from something else. Eg. you might do this by: l = list(s) # Convert to a list l[1] = 'e' # Change the letter s2 = ''.join(l) # Convert the list to a string. (Here the x.join() call means "glue this list together, putting the string x between each element (eg. '-'.join(l) would give 'h-e-l-l-o'). Above we give it the empty string (''), meaning nothing goes between each element.
I'm really liking the look of this, but think I must be struggling to understand a couple of bits, especially around the handling of envrionments. I've tried following the simple demo (which is a bit frustrating as the gif keeps scrolling the commands off the top) and get the following $ poetry new demo -vvv Created package demo in demo $ cd demo/ $ pyenv local demo 3.6.3 pyenv: version `demo' not installed As I'm understanding it you're planning to use the built-in `venv` module to create envrionments, that you expect to be accessed with `pyenv`. However I can't see the env being created at the moment, is that a part that's not implemented yet? Also how do you envisage this working with tox? At the moment I believe tox relies on `setup.py`.

Yep, the `Pipfile` has [a spec](https://github.com/pypa/pipfile). The idea is that `pip` would be able to read a `Pipfile` directly as a more structured alternative to `requirements.txt`. In that world, `pipenv` would just be "intuitive virtualenv management". I think the main thing is I haven't experienced a situation where _I_ need to provide specific, per package configuration to pip that I can't already get in `setup.py`. So having `Pipfile`, even as a standardized, better alternative to `requirements.txt`, feels redundant.

If you link the file, then maybe. Also, is it python 2 or 3?
I am still at the very beginning of learning python thus not having any big projects im working on yet but today I wrote a simple skript that made me excited. It tries out all possible PIN combinations from 0000 to 9999 on Netflix. On Netflix the PIN for "adult content" can be put in wrong as often as one want without getting locked out or something. I am using Netflix together with a girl and 2 of her friends, which I know none of. We dont talk anymore but I still pay her money. Unfortunatley she never told me the PIN. I only know the normal password. Because of things that happened between us, it would be awkward to just ask her which is why I wrote the script. 
Python3. And the file is too large to upload (1GB). I can write a few rows from it if it may be helpful.
Upload it to wetransfer or something
Sounds interesting. Just stopped my electronics studies and want to get going with actually learning programming properly. Good timing, I'll try to remember it. 
Isn't this considered advertisement?
I agree with the utf-16 assessment. Sounds like a [byte order mark](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_order_mark).
**Byte order mark** The byte order mark (BOM) is a Unicode character, U+FEFF byte order mark (BOM), whose appearance as a magic number at the start of a text stream can signal several things to a program consuming the text: What byte order, or endianness, the text stream is stored in; The fact that the text stream is Unicode, to a high level of confidence; Which of several Unicode encodings that text stream is encoded as. BOM use is optional, and, if used, should appear at the start of the text stream. Unicode can be encoded in units of 8-bit, 16-bit, or 32-bit integers. For the 16- and 32-bit representations, a computer receiving text from arbitrary sources needs to know which byte order the integers are encoded in. *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Python/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^| [^Donate](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/donate) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28

In fact, changing the admin url does not prevent this. You have to change path to the admin static files.
Use something that needs less space on your screen like emacs. You can load a terminal inside emacs too, so no need for alt tabbing. 
A library to generate a large image dataset for Deep learning use : https://github.com/tomahim/py-image-dataset-generator I try to make it as simple as possible.. It downloads automatically images from Google and generate thousands of images with few transformations 
It's not a byte order mark, show us a hex dump of the first hundred-ish bytes of the file and I'll see if I can guess it. Otherwise make it utf8 with a conversion error of replace or ignore. https://docs.python.org/3/howto/unicode.html
Well if you've learned a decent amount you can start by doing your own project that would help with your work. You could start contributing to open source projects. Even something like adding documentation to existing packages can help you understand the code more.
About open source projects, how can I find them? Is there a site on which they are listed so I can find one that interests me?

The 00s are weird. If it were every other byte, it would be obviously UTF-16 but it’s a pair of 00s. It’s odd to use null in a text file. Could this be a mainframe file with fixed byte lengths?
I'm clueless about file encoding.. :(
I’m on my phone, so I can’t give you a code sample now, but this is parseable. Just open the file as binary and use f.read(lengthOfRow) then slice off the counter since you don’t care and split the rest on semicolon.

Does the error happen immediately (i.e. on the first line) or does it get part way into the file before failing? As presented, this should work.

Hey, Thank you for that, it fixed the issue with not showing on the screen! So now I do get a distance output on the bottom corner of the frame. However I don't think its measuring accurately or using the blue marker to measure to for that matter as it randomly fluctuates a lot and doesnt seem to respond with respect to the blue colour when I move the object closer or further away from the camera suggesting its measuring to something else. I know that the def find_marker function() is where all markers are defined so both the image "cam1.jpg" (for camera calibration) and colour (measuring to the blue marker in its view) you want to specify reference should both be specified here but I dont think I am doing this correctly. The image is used to calculate focal length and calibrate the camera which is then as a base reference for calculating future distances to anything else which in my case I'm trying to define it so that it applies this calculation from cam1.jpg and uses it for calculating distance to the colour blue in the stream. Any idea on how to reference the blue colour in the def find_marker() function (and throughout the script later on) correctly so that it uses the colour to measure to? Ive updated the code above so you can see the changes. Any help again would be greatly appreciated haha. 
Install PyDev once you install Eclipse, it's a separate installation process still. 
Nobody's said it yet so I will, this is multidimensional data. You should be keeping it together. Don't make two lists, make a tuple and insert those into lists. Don't have two lists that you count on to have the same number of items, that's just dumb.
OK, looks like it was generated on unix, and given the data there's no obvious reason for 0x98 to exist in that text at all. It's not at the start, so it must be the second byte of a line in the file. You can see if it's a line in the file with: path = os.path.dirname(__file__) csv_file = os.path.join(path, 'DTS.csv') print('full file path: %s' % csv_file) depths, temps = [], [] with open(csv_file, 'r') as f: csv_reader = csv.reader(f, delimiter=';') next(csv_reader) for enumerate(l, line) in csv_reader: try: depths.append(float(line[1])) temps.append(float(line[2])) except UnicodeDecodeError as e: print('Unicode error %s on csv line %d' % (e, l)) You can also try this if it's not the float conversion: path = os.path.dirname(__file__) csv_file = os.path.join(path, 'DTS.csv') print('full file path: %s' % csv_file) depths, temps = [], [] with open(csv_file, 'r') as f: csv_reader = csv.reader(f, delimiter=';') next(csv_reader) try: for enumerate(l, line) in csv_reader: depths.append(float(line[1])) temps.append(float(line[2])) except UnicodeDecodeError as e: print('Unicode error %s got to line %d' % (e, csv_reader.line_num)) and this to tell open that it's ascii and to just skip bad data: path = os.path.dirname(__file__) csv_file = os.path.join(path, 'DTS.csv') print('full file path: %s' % csv_file) depths, temps = [], [] with open(csv_file, 'r', encoding='ascii', errors='ignore') as f: csv_reader = csv.reader(f, delimiter=';') next(csv_reader) for enumerate(l, line) in csv_reader: try: depths.append(float(line[1])) temps.append(float(line[2])) except UnicodeDecodeError as e: print('Unicode error %s on csv line %d' % (e, l)) there *is* bad data somewhere in that file, and you need to find it. You can try greping for it grep --color='auto' -P -n "[^\x00-\x7F]" DTS.csv From your initial question, which is much easier to read on my laptop than my phone... it looks like the conversion to float is where the problem exists.
the 000020 etc at the start of the line are just the byte offset from start-of-file, standard xxd style output.
This is terrible
it prints as I said before, but when it comes to appending, it fails.
tried it, didn't work...
That's a little bit wtf. Instead of decode to utf-8, given your data try decode to ascii with an errors of ignore. You also want to see which line the problem is on, so for l, line in enumerate(contents): try: l_dec = line.decode('ascii').split(';') depth, temp = float(l_dec[1]), float(l_dec[2]) depths.append(depth) temps.append(temp) except (ValueError, IndexError) as e: print('invalid data on line %d, "%s"' % (l, e)) depths.append(0) temps.append(0) pass except UnicodeDecodeError as e: print('unicode decode error on line %d, "%s"' % (l, e)) pass 
I found Spotfire to be quite good in this regard with their embedded R Data Functions although the software is quite expensive. Power BI can also be leveraged with R scripts.
Check out youcompleteme on vimawesome. 
You have choices() function in a "random" module. Get 50 000 random choices and use zip() to iterate over both collections. 
Just tag it as low prio then. Otherwise you can't distinguish between stuff that will not be implemented and stuff which is, just that, low prio.

`.decode('ascii')` doesn't work, mate.
There's a lot of implicit magic going on behind the curtains. In fact, that's most of the raison d'être of the library. It's somewhat at odds with "Explicit is better than implicit". And just because I am a grumpy old greybeard, have you considered how often you want your loggers to be tied to a specific module. Why not tie the loggers to a specific dataflow across your application instead? 
Also test stuff, like mocking libraries, etc.
Just use Vim!
Wow, so I should prefer ascii in this case, right? Thanks again. (There should be a +1000 button to vote people like you).
ConEmu, as recommended by others in this thread, has a drop-down mode brought up by Cntl-` (by default). 
It seems weird that they don't have some kind of brute-force protection in place for that. That said, I'd advice against doing it all in one go, though. Maybe throw in a `time.sleep(n)` every X tries? 
I would prefer ascii, but it's just an engineering trade-off. I tend to choose ascii over utf-8 if i know the valid data is definitely ascii. Instead of worrying about how many internet points I get, I just ask that in the future, when someone asks a question and you know the answer you pay it forward. Always bear in mind that programming is an immense topic, and noone can know everything. I happen to know a bit about character encodings because I've done embedded stuff since the 80s, you'll know lots of stuff I don't!

Sorry, the gif is misleading. Poetry does not do virtualenv management (maybe it will in future versions) so you actually have to manage them yourself for now. The example is just to show that poetry works in any existing virtualenv. Regarding tox, this is a hard part since it makes a lot of assumptions about the environment you should have (`setup.py`, `requirements.txt`) so i'll have to take a look at it.
I think multithreading might be overkill for what you're trying to achieve. As /u/efeaydin_ suggested take a look at asyncio - you can queue tasks at a later stage. I guess a quick solution would be to store the time each boss must respawn, then in your while loop you can loop through each boss and check if the current time is greater than or equal to the calculated respawn time.
Yes. 
Ok, so I don't know about "pythonic". I think I do know about funcional. The thing I came up with is: import functools def iterate(x, f): while x is not None: yield x x = f(x) def last(i): return functools.reduce(lambda a, b: b, i) def maybe(x, f): if x is not None: return f(x) print(last(iterate(e, lambda e: e.parent)).data) print(last(iterate(a, lambda a: maybe(a.children, last))).data) is this "better" in some meaningful way? Your while loop is certainly "better" in terms of performance and showing how the code is supposed to work, while I think my version is "better" in terms of composability and showing the intent, you can almost read the line in english: "print the last item of the iteration over e by parent". But python is not the best language for functional / declarative style.
low prio usually means it won't be implemented. There is no inherent value of distinguishing them. Python's issue tracker for example is operated in such away: Look at https://bugs.python.org/issue11573 from 2011, or tons of other issues, some of them include working patches. There is no value in those issues to still be open. Sometimes it is unclear if the complaint in the issues is still valid, etc. Leaving these issues open and not working on them is of course non-confrontational, and thus maybe the easier path because no one must feel ignored. And if ever there isn't enough work, or priorities change, one can reopen such issues, too.
+1 for pycharm, that's what I'm using.
Let me know when you figure out how to exit Emacs.
Or “exec bash”
Windows key + number will open the program at that position on the task bar, better than alt-tabbing
what kind of knowledge you need to be a CS intern?
I’d probably just go for the Anaconda distribution, which comes with Spyder, and Microsoft Visual Code in the latest release. The python plugin for Code is great. Personally I use sublime text and vim.
Ok, now look at focalLength. It is dependant on the value of marker[0][1] when it is declared, but only is only assigned a value once before you start pulling frames. Then you modify marker in the loop, but you are not updating focalLength too... And then you use focalLength with that distance to camera function. Maybe the problem is there? 
I don't know any specific tools for your situation, so it'd probably be easier for you to write your own wrapper. I'd keep a dictionary of cookies where the key is the domain, and let that dictionary persist using pickle. You've broken down the steps simply enough that writing a wrapper shouldn't be too hard. I haven't done much with session data and requests, but if you can figure that part out, adding it to some simple code written below should be manageable. jar = pickle.load("./cookie.jar") if domain in jar: cookie = jar[domain] else: cookie = requests.Session() jar[domain] = cookie # now update cookie with session data
Use PyCharm as other have recommended. It easily intergrates with git or mercurial, has remote debugging, auto upload, etc... All things which are great while working.
I'm fairly new to coding, and my current practice project is a script to track Smash Bros Melee matchup statistics. I'll be using it whenever I play my brother, and after each match I'll log the characters, stage, and whether or not I won; it should, when finished, be able to tell me my win rates in varying levels of specificity. For example, it will be able to tell me my over all win rate, or my win rate when I pick Marth, or my win rate when my brother picks Peach and we play on Pokemon Stadium, or my win rate when I play Marth and he plays peach and we play on Pokemon Stadium, or whatever. Right now I'm running into a few errors which I suspect have to do with variable scope, but I'm not sure how to fix them. I have some variables which should be global, but for some reason I can't access them within some functions. https://github.com/GeoffreyTaucer/SmashStats/blob/master/main Here it is, if anybody wants to take a look and help me out.
I set a reminder from the YouTube stream URL. Looking forward to the Python intro session! 😁
There are two things that I think will help you. The first one is that you need to gain experience. Once you feel confident in your abilities, you can go to a freelance site and get some small jobs. That won't help your curriculum very much, but it will help you personally. It'll prove to yourself that you're capable of delivering solutions. It also will teach you a lot about practical issues outside the language. The second thing is you should study the things you find interesting, and try to master them. There are a lot of thing you need to know (tools like VCS, bug reporting, etc.), but if you're interested in a particular area (front end, back end, databases, architecture, ...), and you're able to be proficient there, a lot of doors will be open to you.
Perfect use for config management tools like Ansible, Puppet, Salt, Chef, etc.
It's 'scrape' and 'scraping'
Wrong. This is spam, deep-linked, referral garbage. hxxps://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=dVZV...&amp;mid=39...&amp;u1=cc&amp;murl=https%... Don't post this junk here.
I wouldn’t run a firmware update in a detached child process, too much effort and would be counter-intuitive for a user that expects feedback. Any time I run updates for anything it’s done in a screen or tmux session for this very reason.
It really is weird.. Why advice against it? I will do it in thousands or 500 steps anyway, because the script is relatively slow. I had to throw in small time.sleep()s because otherwise the Netflix page won't respond fast enough. Like 0000 to 0500 then 0501 to 1000 and so on.
This works incredibly well, thanks for this
 Seems alot more work for something I consider a basic requirement but maybe the devs at Facebooks don't have a requirement for this. 
How would I go about giving myself permission to run the script? Considering I made it I would've thought it would've worked
If you're running Linux u can just put(as root) chmod 775 ScriptName. On windows you should be logged as admin, but try right clicking the IDE (Idle or whathever you are using) and select run as administrator. 
I dont get the option to run as administrator does that mean I already am the admin

Why don't you take a gander up to the trending subs? ;)
They were asking for feedback, but hadn't announced that it was official or what it will look like. It's likely to happen, but there are a few challenges, such as do your customers need to have python installed or how do you add your favorite package to it? Is the version of Python a stock version or can it be upgraded?
If you don't have the option on Windows, you aren't admin
Uh Facebook and Twitter absolutely have APIs. And you probably shouldn't use Selenium to post to them because they won't appreciate it. For many site though that you aren't trying to spam (or don't have very good spam prevention) you can probably just figure out what the end points are and POST or GET to them yourself.
Trying to write something for work to help automate some pentesting processes we go through often. 
Considering it's been around for 18 years, the answer will probably often be "because you already support apps using it." I like Postgres a lot, but if I work in an environment using SQL Server, I'll write apps that store data to SQL Server. Crossing database types is often a pain (though Postgres does lovely with foreign data wrappers, I've heard). I haven't seen much in the way of comparison with Postgres benchmarks, but Firebird features seem to be more equivalent to Postgres than something like MySQL or SQLite.

Sweet article :) 
I have a feeling this will make Twitter a bit unhappy.
I had a lot of trouble following this article. I was expecting to learn about how the tweets were scraped, but got lost in an overcomplicated and broken tutorial of using other technologies. Additionally, there are: - missing details (Docker version is specified but not the Python version) - deprecated practices (absolute_import) - bad practices (except Exception) - unreachable code (print statement after return)
pycurl package supports COOKIEFILE and COOKIEJAR curl options.
Hi, author here. I don't believe that automatically picking the right logger name is "magic" (in the bad sense of the word). It's pretty explicit about what it does: When you log something, automatically log to the name of the current module. This obviously isn't for everybody, but 99% of the time when I want to do some logging, this is what I want, and the "convention over configuration" aspect saves me a lot of bother. Happy to look into ways to support other conventions too, if this is something you want. File an issue?

I'm looking for some help with a homework assignment for programing in Python. We've been working on a program to convert imperial measurements to metric and now they have introduced functions such as the main() function. Were suppose to get the input in the main function and then pass it to the conversions. Here is the code.
Update: More tickets have been released
This is an insanely over-complicated way of trying to do this. 
Okay so your first problem is you’re creating the variable counter In your main and then trying to use it in the function. You’ll have to pass it as a parameter to the function in order to use it.
Short answer yes. Long answer: you need to give details. What's your host os? where are you running bash? Is it Windows 10 bash? Where have you installed anaconda? etc. etc.
That seemed to be the issue, thank you very much for your help.
Is it? If i said i needed 100 million tweets in 24h how woulsw you do it with less work?
166 EPS is really not a metric to talk about.
The problem is that the boss respawn 1 hour countdown starts only when he is killed and that may happen anytime so the respawn timer is also unknown. Eg, 1st sequence: boss A killed first, boss C at minute 1 later and boss B at minute 5 after boss A 2nd sequence: boss B killed first, boss A 2 minutes later and boss C 10 minutes after B I’ll give Asyncio a read too thanks!
Yeah and reading "scrapping" makes me think I'm throwing 10000 tweets in 60 seconds in the trash....which made this way more interesting until I realized it was supposed to be "scraping"
Probably decompiled the Java client?
Hey, it's windows 10 bash with Anaconda installed in the default directory. Is the interpreter selection relevant terminal configuration?
Ignoring the fact that this violates the terms of service... The easier solution depends on how much coordination you need. Just scraping raw web data is going to get you tons of duplicates which you'll have to resolve. You could break it down a bit by having a list of searches that you check regularly, which may or may not need a central list. If the goal is spread across a series of different searches, you could even just do several instances of the same script with a subset of those searches. You can run them on multiple machines to help distribute the load. If you need some sort of coordination, you could use multiprocessing on the same machine. For a lot of scraping and API tasks you'll be limited by request wait times with the second issue being disk write speeds. You could even scale it slightly with just rabbitmq and several instances of the same script. Each script pulls the next search from the list, executes and adds to the db. For some tasks, I've been able to spawn 16-32 different processes to scrape data with a few lines of code. multiprocessing is a bit of a mess on some platforms, but it generally works for most simple solutions. 
Looks good mate. The code is well laid out and looks good. 
For starters: * Use multiple JSON files in place of PostgreSQL * Use the [consumers](https://github.com/nvllsvm/consumers) in place of Celery and RabbitMQ. (multiprocessing)[https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/multiprocessing.html] would also work.
I'm not saying it'll fix it. Decode to utf8 with ignore.
In addition to the low technical quality of the article, it's suggesting using Tor to avoid getting banned. This is a despicable thing to do, as it makes sites even more likely to try and keep Tor traffic out; causing problems for those who need Tor to avoid repressive government practices, and taking advantage of people volunteering their resources to support the network. Seriously, this is an assholish thing to do.
10000 tweets in one hour is *much* smaller than 100 million tweets in 24 hours. So, how would *you* do it with less work?
I would use a similar strategy because a docker swarm plus celery is a pretty good tool for this
Sure but pure MP stops at one server. This can scale to 500 servers. 
"Hey, boss, I need over 400 times the amount of hardware that I needed before, is it okay if I run up six or seven figures on the company's AWS bill?"
Add unit tests. Add docstrings. Don't import from * as it screws up your namespaces. Add command line options for the server port or any thing else that may be configured (argparse if you're sticking with the stdlib, not reading from sys). 
Why would you need to scale to 500 servers for 100m tweets? This is over-engineering through and through. Is it wrong? No, but as I stated, it's just overly complex for what it's trying to do. And as mentioned in my answer a single script could be run on 500 or 500000 servers with far less overhead. If you want to deploy that faster, toss that single script in a docker image and toss it to AWS. There's very valid reasons to use celery and rabbitmq and docker clusters. This specific instance isn't one of them, no matter how much you want to scale it. 
From a Unix point of view, and with some caveats Windows also, there are a very standard few inputs from a parent process like the shell to a child process like python (or anything else). * the current user id (in python, `os.getuid()`) * the current group id (in python, `os.getgid()`) * the current working directory (in python, `os.getcwd()`) * the argument list (in python, `sys.argv` with the leading interpreter argument removed) * the standard i/o handles (`sys.stdin`, `sys.stdout`, `sys.stderr`) * the current environment variables (in python, `os.environ`) There are a few other more subtle hand-me-downs, but this is what you should expect. The bash or cmd shell is interpreting things on the command line and forming the above set of hand-me-downs for the newly created process. Both shells eat various command syntax elements like `&lt; inputfile` or `&gt; outputfile` or `2&gt;/dev/null` or `2&gt;&amp;1` and open the files and hand down the file descriptor/handles for your new process as stdin, stdout, or stderr. In bash, it eats `*.txt` and expands the argument list with a glob list, but in cmd you need to do that yourself. In bash, it eats expansions like `${HOME}` and replaces it with environment variable values before your program sees it; in cmd the same thing happens with `%HOME%`.
Please don't make a spambot.

You're right - consumers only runs using Python processes on a single machine. I was trying to demonstrate an alternative to the solution in the article instead of the 100 million you mentioned. I have my doubts that the solution in the article would scale to 500 servers. I'm guessing there would be bottlenecks in RabbitMQ and PostgreSQL that are not mentioned.

i’m very very new to this, but i’m going to teach myself python so that i can input a bunch of json files that are output from some benchmarking tools (fio, and ior) for our HPC cluster. i’ll want to extract certain useful data from the files (job name, io_ kbytes, etc.) and then take that output and eventually visualize it. 
It's about time to scrap twitter.
So, one thing to understand here is that bash is the program handling this, and it's not something the program differentiates between stdin, or being cat a file like `cat pear.txt | python apple.py`. Bash is a shell, and a shell is a program that execs/forks other programs with environment variables and uses pipes to control how it gets stdin and where stdout goes and such. Basically your script can't distinguish between it being a user manually typing in input, or bash redirecting like `&lt; pear.txt`, or `cat pear.txt | python apple.py`. It's all the same to your program. It just reads stdin, because that's the same place all of that goes (even a user who executes the program, then starts typing). I'm sure this all answers your question, but I would suggest reading up a little bit on the syscalls and how the operating system executes/forks programs. One thing I've noticed is that some people misunderstand what bash is doing before executing the program, like `ls -al *`. The program `ls` doesn't see the star. It receives something like `ls -al file1 file2 ...` because bash expands that star itself, then executes with those strings in argv, just like it might expand an environment variable if you type `ls $HOME`. To prove it, try running this: $ touch './-al' $ ls * You'll notice that `ls` thinks it got the `-al` flag even though you didn't pass it. Bash expands the * out, and ls can't tell the difference.

I've created a Fortnite Discord bot as well, what I did is that I just used a statistics website and I grabbed HTML content from it. Not very reliable, but it works for me.
I've created a Discord bot that does a lot, from giving updates on Twitch channels, some commands, and adding things like Fornite levels to your server nickname.
In addition to this, are you using tabs indentation? Looks like 8 spaces per indentation. If you want your code to look like everyone elses code then 4 spaces is the most common.
as the hiring manager, I would open the github, see the spelling mistakes and close it again and move on. If you can't be bothered to put error-free english on a repo that will be on your resume, why would you care for error-free code? Sorry if it's a little harsh, but it's reality. 
JavaScript*
[Read PEP8 and follow it!](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) Most obvious thing is that it's tabs instead of 4 whitespaces. PEP8 is the official standard, and most workplaces I've seen adhere to it.
Yes.. definitely unit tests. Hiring people will be far more impressed with tested code vs untested 
Also, you could probably split the file up into several other files to isolate separate bits of logic (db operations, cache, etc), use constants in some places (PUSH, PULL, DROP, etc)
I've had good luck using SQLite for similar purposes. You can use primary keys to enforce uniqueness, aggregate functions to summarize results, and default timestamp columns to check freshness of data. Anytime I'm thinking of writing a custom file format to store anything, I ask myself "can SQLite do this?" 99% of the time the answer's yes, and I get the added bonus of being able to write ad-hoc queries against my data. Or just dump your internal data structure into a JSON file. It's 1 line of code. 
Machine limitation. above 15 workers my machine went unresponsive. You may increase number of workers and concurrency.
Thanks for your suggestion. It's been fixed.
Than you everyone for your feedback. - This article is for educational purpose i.e. how to use celery and RabbitMQ with docker cluster along with rotating proxy. Using or misusing it is entirely depends on the reader. - If it looks slow, you may try to increase the worker threads and concurrency. My machine hangs inf I try to increase the worker counts more than 15. - Sorry for spelling mistakes. They are fixed now. - I am no expert. Trying to learn new things and sharing them ( for people who don't know). Those who are expert on these topics are expected to be polite and point out the mistakes so that me (and other newbies like me) can be benefited. - And again, Please be polite.
Does anyone have any opinions on the database storage mechanism? Someone on Quora suggested a file-based dumpster attempt but I'm afraid of data corruption.
&gt; - Yes you can use flat file Using postgres is optional, not mandatory. My point here is that you wrote a mini tutorial on psycopg2 on an already bloated tutorial. It makes for a poor reading experience. &gt; - Python version is 3 as mentioned in docker file. please read carefully. Digging into a Dockerfile nested away on a separate domain is non-obvious for something that should be. Especially when your code indicates a target of Python 2 with the absolute_import. &gt; Anyways we are running python on local machine but in docker which is using python:3 docker image so no need to mention python version. ... that's your environment. As a reader, I don't know what you're doing in your environment. Also - I don't understand what you mean by running "python" on a local machine. That could be 2 or 3 depending on the OS or Python distribution. &gt; - Code wise - Yes there are few bad practices.. but that was not the focus point. What the... I'm sorry, but that's just bullshit. You wrote a tutorial and shared it with a Python community all while **knowing** it contains poor quality Python. It's distracting and makes readers who know better doubt the competency of both the article and author.
I'm using tabs. As much as I know people use spaces, it kills me because most people set their editors to convert tabs to spaces anyway, which seems kind of ignorant to me but, it is what it is.
I doubt tor would help keep someone from getting banned, as lots of services rate limit tor end nodes more than they do general traffic.
What is your python interpreter set to in pycharm, you can choose it when you set up a project or edit later. If you select that and then Tools -&gt; console it will be an anaconda prompt.
PyCharm! When in doubt, IntelliJ
Considering PEP8 is the standard and most places use it, is suggest you stop being stubborn. Everyone you work with is going to think and approach problems differently, and your going to have spend some effort understanding their code at times. So why would you want to have to constantly waste brainpower adjusting to everyone else's idiosyncracies? Maybe it seems like a really insignificant thing. If that's the case, just switch to the standard. It's insignificant, so why insist on tabs? When your short on brain cells you'll be thankful that foreign formatting isn't burning up any more of them.
I certainly don't like the Quake mode, but finally having a replacement CMD is excellent. Been searching for forever with a replacement for windows. TCCLE just couldn't work for me so this has been great, yay for cmder!
&gt; To me, tabs are like that. Why hit 4 keys when 1 serves the same purpose and has no other function in the language? I'll still have to get used to it but it still seems no less moronic to me. Well, if that's what you think is happening when people tell you to use spaces instead of tabs I can understand your stubbornness and/or confusion. However, your editor should insert spaces when you hit the tab button. You never hit the spacebar for indentation.
Which is even more moronic in my opinion. Spaces and tabs are equal everywhere in the language (except for when they're packaged for pip). Let's put it this way: Assuming you program a robot to eat the soup for you, would you program it to use a spoon or a fork? Sure, it can get the job done with a fork, probably better than you can but it's still more efficient to use the spoon. Spaces also make the file bigger (which isn't that bad but is still a disadvantage which can be avoided).
It's set to the interpreter in my conda env (C:\ProgramData\Anaconda2\envs\&lt;my environment name&gt;\Python.exe Closest thing I see to what you suggested is Tools &gt; Terminal. Then it shows my file path to Git Bash that I set before. I tried copying the Conda Console shortcut's target link in there but it didn't work at all. (That link is: %windir%\System32\cmd.exe "/K" C:\ProgramData\Anaconda2\Scripts\activate.bat C:\ProgramData\Anaconda2 ) 
As someone who is learning python and has been helped by examples and the strong learning community, I want to share a little feedback. I would be cautious with you saying that you are trying to share with bothers despite admitting you are not an expert. Share what you have for either critique or education. Not both. If you want to inform others then it better be damn near perfect or you will be propagating your mistakes (namely the syntax and spelling mistakes as others have pointed out). Further, if you are seeking critiques than take feedback with a little bit of grace. People rarely want the excuse for why you think their criticism is wrong. Take the advice under serious advisement. When people say your code is sloppy or your article is missing some details, it probably is. Taking feedback and using it to improve yourself rather than reflexively defending your first draft makes you better in the long run. Good luck and thanks for sharing.

Avoid developing strong opinions until your experienced enough to justify them. Judging your code, you are far, far away still. It would do you well to reflect on your tone and communication skills.

Thank you. I will work on fixing the issues.
With all due respect, I have stated twice that I'm going to have to adopt it. I, however, cannot change my mind on how stupid it is. Although I have stated that I would follow specs because I'd have to, I'm not going to say it's a good idea. Sorry but in my mind, it's wasted effort. If that's what you're looking for, you're asking a potential employee to change their mind on something, not because you present evidence to them but because you say so. Because of that, I'm not sure I want to work for your company to begin with if all your developers have to think and feel the same about your policies.
No I'm just saying that's what you're going to hear with this stubborn position you're taking.
OK, I'm not trying to get an attitude. I just have a difference of opinion. Which you are stating I should get punished for? I have stated twice that I'd have to adopt the standard. Why should I have to also think it sane? Is there some thought god who will punish me for thinking the wrong thing? I don't understand why having a difference of opinion means that I should be unemployable. Could you explain this to me? Can you tell me why it's a smart idea to have 4 spaces, besides the fact that it's in the standard? Standards change all the time because people realize they don't make sense. That's why there are revisions. So, give me one good reason why using 4 spaces is appropriately handled by the language and not the IDE and I'll recant the whole idea.
Yeah because information that you'd collect by botting "users" would totally be accurate and representative of the growths that happened already, and it's not like every account grows differently. Nice excuse, but like, try going outside sometime and find some friends, not try to boost your ego with fake followers somehow.
There is no "wasted effort" with using spaces. Every decent editor/IDE will happily convert a tab-key-press into 4 spaces, and remove them in blocks of 4 with a single backspace. What editor are you using? I'm all for arguing a technical point and technical decisions *should* be made on their merits. But this is not a technical point, it's a social one. The community standards say use 4 spaces. Using 4 spaces has no cost. Not using 4 spaces leads to pointless conversations like this. Use 4 spaces. The red flag is that you're this opinionated and willing to argue about something this insignificant. You seem like you'd be hard to work with.
If I was hiring I wouldn't hire you because you sound like an ass tbh famalam.
Well, it's only about being consistent and going with the style that your collaborators use. If I worked on a side-project where the other people used tabs, I'd use tabs for that. But I'd wonder why they weren't following PEP8 and it'd be a bit weird. Python makes it incredibly easy to pick up somewhere else and not have to read up on their official in-house style. We can pick up and work on anything and use the same styleguide. That consistency is one thing that's awesome about Python, and I highly suggest doing it, because it helps *others* work with you on your own code just as much as it helps you jump in a new job and know the official way of doing things. I'd way rather read one style-guide, learn it by heart, and use it everywhere I work rather than jump in and have to relearn a new style every new job. Even if it feels uncomfortable at first, it's just better to go with it because it just makes all our lives easier for everyone to follow it and use it. In the end, this is about making all our lives easier.
Ah, I see. Poking through the code I did find your venv util, but now understand why I couldn't work out how it was meant to be creating the envrionment. Tox now supports plugins for the backend, with work going on to support pipfile/pipenv which could help. I can see it wouldn't really be a priority for you at the moment though.
Nothing wrong with using tabs, just change your tab width in your editor to 4 spaces instead of 8.
Please let me know if it is not appropriate posting this again so soon. I have had two weeks off of work, so the package has come a long way in the last two weeks. I'm more than happy to take it down if it feels spammy.
"But this is not a technical point, it's a social one. The community standards say use 4 spaces. Using 4 spaces has no cost. Not using 4 spaces leads to pointless conversations like this. Use 4 spaces." There is no human wasted effort because the machine does the conversion for you. As I pointed out earlier, if a robot were to use a spoon in my story, it would still be wasted. This is a technical point because it's in a technical specification. I'm not arguing against potential employment or a potential employers wishes. I'll happily do it. It just doesn't make sense to me to do it. If you're taking this as a social issue, I think we need to take a break from talking because my points have been in specifications only. It feels like a wasteful specification to me, even if the waste is minimal. If my potential employer wants their code that way, that's their business because it's their code and their machine which will be running it. Nothing more. I'm not good at presenting my ideas to others and that's probably why people are all upset over this thread (as demonstrated by the number of down-votes) but technically, can you give me one good reason for the spaces over the tab? My reason (technically) is that it adds characters to the code which are unnecissary. I'm not going to argue with an employer over it. I'm frankly not being interviewed here, or at least I thought I wasn't. I just submitted my code to a thread and asked people what they thought. Now, apparently, I'm being interviewed for jobs which I never knew I applied for. People are telling me they'd never hire me in a context which is't a professional job environment but instead, a website where I was having a conversation about my resume. In a conversation context, it is a stupid practice but a practice nonetheless embraced by companies because of a standard. Just because it is a standard, doesn't mean it's the best option.
Thanks for your your answer, I think some websites has API but not all of them, that's why I was asking :) 
Just to be clear, at the time of my original comment, I hadn't actually seen you say you *would* adopt the standard. If you've said it elsewhere in the thread, great, but at least as far as I can tell, you've only said you'd have to get used to it. You then escalate that to calling people who follow it 'moronic'. You have 94 lines of code on github, which isn't following standards, and you are calling the entire Python ecosystem moronic. It's just... silly. And when I said, "Why would anyone want to hire you?", I wasn't saying you should be punished. I was trying to get you to understand why your arguments are irrelevant and misguided. Everything I've seen in this thread indicates (to me) that you wouldn't play well with a team. When I hire someone, I'm adding them to a team that works well together. That team produces PEP8-compliant code. When I interview someone who produces PEP8-compliant code in their coding samples, a major box gets checked in my mental checklist. On the other hand, when I see someone who doesn't follow PEP8 (even openly criticizes it), I find it hard to take them seriously. &gt; give me one good reason why using 4 spaces is appropriately handled by the language and not the IDE and I'll recant the whole idea. It may be because it's 3am, but I have read your question several times and don't understand what you're asking. Are you missing a word somewhere in there? Anyway, the main reason for using 4 spaces is the fact that indentation is syntactical in Python, and the community is predominately open-source. If you're only going to work with your own code, fine, do what you want. But if you (with your editor set up to use tabs) send me a change request (in my project that uses spaces), there is a high likelihood that your changes will break it. Maybe not immediately (because hopefully you tested your changes first), but eventually. Say you add a method and all lines are indented with tabs. Sure, it works. Now imagine someone else modifies your method, adding a line which is indented with spaces. They immediately get indentation warnings, they have to fix all of your indentations, and you've wasted their time. In addition, consistency with tabs makes code easier to read. The easier it is to read, the easier it is to conduct code reviews, and to see potential issues. Let's say English isn't your first language, but you are working with an English team. If you decide to name a variable "sugundos_transcurrido" instead of "seconds_elapsed", what's the likelihood someone else will know what you mean? "But," you object, "Just because they used English doesn't mean I should have to!" You see, it doesn't really matter what your personal worldview is... if you're choosing to work with other people, you need to "work with" them. Part of working with a team is imagining what will happen after you've committed your code.
&gt; can you give me one good reason for the spaces over the tab? Technical? No. I agree that tabs "make more sense" as a tab character. The issue with them (which is unique to Python) is that mixing tabs (indentation) and spaces (alignment) can break your code. One solution to that would be to make tabs visible in editors, and stop trying to align things with spaces. The other solution would be to use spaces in place of tabs. The second option was chosen, probably because it doesn't require special configuration of editors or changing peoples alignment tendencies. &gt; it adds characters to the code which are unnecissary So? What is the cost here. &gt; Just because it is a standard, doesn't mean it's the best option. Absolutely. But not following a standard has costs. Driving on the left hand side of the road is apparently safer, because the majority of people are right-hand right-eye dominant. Are you going to start driving on the left? &gt; I'm frankly not being interviewed here, or at least I thought I wasn't. I just submitted my code to a thread and asked people what they thought. You've posted your resume and github repo, asking for critique. That critique *has* to come from the position of "would I hire this person" otherwise it's pointless. Honestly, you using tabs alone wouldn't be enough to put me off... we all have our quirks, and frankly who cares. It's more "if you're willing to argue about something so trivial, what will you be like when it really matters".
Ahahah don't worry. This ain't a spambot, but it needs to be fast and be able to post on website and respect a certain schedule. I agree it definetly looks like a spambot ! 
Fwiw, mixed indentation types in a single file is disallowed in py3
No technique as such, simply obey the rate limits set by the site. There is really no harm in taking days or weeks to perform the initial crawling of the content you're after, and you can still crawl a large number of separate sites simultaneously so you crawler won't have to sit idle. This is how all the large crawler engines do it: slow &amp; steady gets the job done. If you do want to skirt the rules somewhat without affecting others too much, get a bunch of separate IP addresses and scrape from those.
I was not my intention to argue with potential employers on here but to express my frustration with the habit to other developers -- which I still have. Growing up, I was trained to pay attention to very small details: My step-father could come in after a long days work and tell if randomly given objects in the house had been moved or rotated in any way. I grew up around that and I guess incorporated it into myself -- at 30 years old, it's finally beginning to wear down but it persists in certain areas. One of those areas is my code. So, having to use 4 spaces does seem like a HUGE waste to me -- as you've said, it's only there because the syntax demands it. However, if someone were to pay me $400 to go buy them a 10 million dollar car, I'd do it. It seems like a huge waste to me and frankly, if the law demanded that everyone owned a $10 million car, it would annoy the crap out of me because that would mean everyone would be going around with cars that were way more expensive than they needed to be. It's a waste. However, I would go out and buy the car for the person paying me $400 because that's what they want and I'm making $400. It doesn't mean I won't continue to believe they're stupid for spending that amount on a car. The Python spec is the law in this analogy. Everything I've said in this context, wasn't to potential employers but to people on the internet. I still think it's moronic to use spaces instead of tabs. That isn't going to change but if that's what my employer is paying me for, I'm giong to do it because, at the end of the day, it's their code and not mine.
&gt; OK, I'm not trying to get an attitude. I just have a difference of opinion. Which you are stating I should get punished for? No, you should get "punished" for calling your peers (whom you are asking for advice), potential employers, and professionals 'ignorant' and 'moronic'. People are engaging in this discussion, arguing why your choice of 'tabs' over 'spaces' may not actually get you hired, *especially* when calling said people's opinions 'moronic'. Notice, how NOT A SINGLE person in this thread has called you or your opinion 'moronic'. At least not until you started doing exactly that. THAT makes you unemployable.
If someone calls my opinion moronic online, I'm not going to get angry about it and I'm not going to take it personally, especially when they may be right. I may have a very stupid opinion. However, my opinion isn't directed at them personally. Think of it this way, If a 20-year-old man believed in Santa, you'd call him a moron right? If a 5-year-old believed in Santa, you'd call him normal. In the context of syntax, the idea of including 4 spaces is unnecessary and kind of a lapse of thinking. People do moronic things all the time -- I do them and I personally use the word moron to describe myself when doing these actions. I apologize if I hurt someone's feelings but I don't think any of them took it as a personal attack on their character (except if you write the specification). If they had said using tabs was moronic and gave a reason, I would probably agree that in that context, it was a little stupid. Guess who'd be at the receiving end of that? Me and, because this is the Internet, I wouldn't have had a problem with it because I'd have assumed they'd be going after the idea of using tabs and not me personally. With all due respect, it is ignorant on a personal level as well. There have been two people who have admitted in this entire discussion that the only reason it's done is for consistency. Everyone else has said to just go along with it. The word ignorant means someone who doesn't know -- that's it. Since no one else has a reason why they do it except that everyone else is doing it, I didn't miss the definition on that word. There's also nothing wrong with being ignorant. I'm ignorant on a lot of things if someone said using tabs was ignorant, I'd want to know why, then I'd assess their statement and re-evaluate. I appreciate the help and I'm not attacking them personally but the idea itself. You'll notice I never once called anyone ignorant or moronic. I always said the ideas themselves were.
Pycharm is great stuff
Yes. You are right. Unfortunately I can not change the title of the post now. Thanks.
Thanks, this is more in line with what I was looking for. It is indeed better as far as I am concerned, although, it doesn't look like it is an idiom in Python (for the reason that you noted -- that Python is not the right language for such a style).
I think that it helps be consistent across languages. If I press tab in any of my editors I get four spaces. That works in python, it also works in json, javascript, sql, etc. I prefer the tab character but it introduces a character that is a) invisible and b) doesn't play well in some contexts, so I'm happy to have stopped using it. There's an insignificant increase in the size of the file. 
With Python, it really has to be spaces.
/r/learnpython. Also, you can't have a dot at the end of a variable name.
Thanks for sharing, very informative 
I was gonna write a detailled reply, beginning by explaining that insulting the python standard is not really a good idea if you seek to be employed in python. But that would be a waste of time. I'm just going to say that I would hate working with you. But I don't think you can be hired anywhere in this field. Don't bother replying, that, too, would be a waste of time.
sqlite database. you have the option to use it in-memory or in a file using a stable format with atomic reads and writes. 
Visual studio code is amazing 
You also need to learn all the things that are expected from a programmer that most tutorials ignore. Learn to use git, learn to comment/document your code, learn to do unit tests, and higher-level tests. These are the main difference between a hobbyist and a professional developer.
Note you are doubling a jar lookup here. I would change your 3 lines to 2, i.e. change: if domain in jar: cookie = jar(domain) else: to: cookie = jar.get(domain) if not cookie: 
Like what K900_ said , no dot after the end of variable 
/u/ki4jgt its more of a preference, but you should consider adopting [Pathlib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html) over os.path. Its really clean and less clunky IMO.
Great links, really helpful. Thank you.
That's a good point of view, I'll search about the areas and test them out. Thank you.
Yeah I tried that but it is so hard to get anything to run because of some file called launch.json and everything 
I successly use both rabbitmq and postgres with north of 500 servers. I found people that blindly chant avoid premature optimization have a very poor eye for architecture. If you are building a massive scraper and you sit there benchmarkimg before deciding to build a distributed cluster, you missed the boat.
You're gonna get banned super quick. 
That's the file for debuging, youtube the setup and you'll be good to go
Cool! Maybe you could also include the pro scene win rate for the matchup and stadium as a means of comparison.
&gt;I'll admit stubbornness. But it isn't that it's insignificant, it's that it's kind of -- with all due respect to the companies using it -- moronic. Dude, people who endlessly debate inconsequential decisions are a far bigger problem in the software industry than any marginal benefit that would be gained from the "right" choice of indentation.
How is it compared to `tox`? 
Here are technical reasons: In python 3 you cannot mix tabs and spaces; In everyone's editor they can have their tabs set to n amount of spaces. That means that the code does not look consistent across various users computers. "Oh no! Not looks!" I hear you say. "That's not a technical reason!" I hear you say. Maybe not at first glance, but it absolutely is. Let's say that you and I are pairing and you're remoted into my tmux session. I use vim. You now have to come up to speed on the layout of the code which means that's wasted time; You have your editor setup to use tabs and not spaces. You don't have a gitattribute file in your repo. You make a single line change to your code and commit it. The file either saves every line with tabs or you have mixed tabs and spaces. In the former case that makes diffs for git painful. In the latter case it means you have mixed case which won't run in Python 3; Most editors are not gonna show tab characters unless you explicitly ask for it. I once had a junior dev who was new to the language tell me after a few weeks, "Learning python really is like joining a cult." And he wasn't wrong. The specs exist for a reason. They're agreed upon constructs so that others can jump into your code easily without having to mess with their editor settings. It's not just about the technical constructs, but the social constructs, the community, and the way folks work together.
What's your end goal here? Do you just want to serve a single websocket connection?
I'm wanting to listen to a websocket stream and do stuff based on the incoming events. Sorry should have been more specific.
Yeah had a read through a load of them before including that one. The problem is more of a basic understanding on my part. Just trying to learn at the moment so it's probably a really simple answer lol
Hi there, from the /r/Python mods. We have removed this post as it is not suited to the /r/Python subreddit proper, however it should be very appropriate for our sister subreddit /r/LearnPython.

 nums. A dot is not valid when defining a variable name. That's what `SyntaxError: invalid syntax` is trying to say here.
Message the mods. Not here.
Yeah I'm not asking specifically whats wrong just some ideas of where would be good to check. maybe I'll post the function that hangs. Whats cron? Monitoring Memory is a good idea and couldnt hurt to monitor CPU, would you suggest doing this externally or withing python?

Thanks for the heads up! I hadn't noticed that.
This is one of the worst formatted blogs I've ever seen. Totally impossible to follow.
Awesome! Regardless of what I said about the article, you managed to get something functional using a wide a number of technologies. With some sharpening of your writing and presentation skills, there's no dobubt you could make a decent tutorial. Good luck!
Cron is a Linux tool for automating tasks and such. Windows has even scheduler I'd use an external program like resource monitor on windows, or top on Linux
&gt; It's documentation is comprehensive for Seriously? I don't feel it... Most command-line options are undocumented (they have captain-obvious style comments, like `--envs Output Environment Variable options.` -- that sure did explain to me what the heck it's supposed to do. What environment? Virtualenv or my shell or whatever shell it is going to create with `pipenv shell`?). There isn't even an index of all available options / arguments. The autogenerated index contains piles of junk. On a scale of 1 to 10, I'd give it a 3. I mean, they did put some effort into it, but it's quite a bit below average. Further, even if Pipfile and Pipfile.lock have any sort of syntax / grammar rules, they are only known to authors of this project. I was never able to find them anywhere, not even in the project's source. Furthermore, some options you can specify in Pipfile, are impossible from command line... (this is a result of poor documentation, poor planning and subsequent poor execution). One thing the documentation of this project doesn't lack is the self-promotion part. I bet, people writing it contacted Cisco / Spring documentation before. :D So much self-absorption, they even open documentation with testimonials! I almost reached for my credit card after reading the first paragraph!
What an idiotic line of reasoning. Of course Python's `lambda` doesn't implement λ from the Lambda Calculus; how could it, in a language that doesn't even have proper functions, a language where everything can have side effects and most things actually do. Nobody in their right mind is going to assume that Python's `lambda` can be used to do Lambda Calculus stuff. But that doesn't mean `lambda` is a useless feature. Its usefulness has little if anything to do with Lambda Calculus, currying, partial application, and any of that; its claim to fame is much simpler, namely, not having to go through the ceremony of introducing a named function for a tiny single-use thing. In Haskell, we might want to traverse a list, incrementing each element by 1, like so: `map (+1) things`. This is convenient, not so much because of its theoretical soundness, but simply because the `+1` part carries no more semantic meaning than "add one", and being forced to factor it out into a named function of its own makes the code strictly worse by adding useless clutter. Writing `map addOne things where addOne x = x + 1` is less readable by any metric I can think of. Even `map (\x -&gt; x + 1) things` is better - it still introduces a meaningless variable name (`x`), but at least it avoids providing a useless name for the "add one" function. And the same is valid in Python, too. Compare: def add_one(x): return x + 1 map(add_one, things) vs.: map(lambda x: x + 1, things) Provided that you know and understand `lambda` itself, does the first one provide you with any additional information? Do the additional two lines of code, and the extra mental indirection through the `add_one` name, pull their weight? I don't think so.
Try out [pystuck](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pystuck) Or some other similar debugger that lets you do inspection after it hangs. There must be some blocking call that it is hitting and failing to make progress. Without further details about how it uses threads, sockets or whatever it is not possible to describe the number of ways this could happen. But you need a debugging facility to see where it happens and if it happens in a consistent manner.
Pyenv is for managing different Python versions. Pipenv is for managing project dependencies and their versions. 
Check in File -&gt; Settings, you can see interpreter again and then build ,deployment, and execution. A path might be messed up or you could try to just reset it and rebuild it. 
Exactly, and that is why `lambda` should have a different name. Your argument is the same as the post: `lambda` in Python has little to do with Lambda Calculus, but it is a short, inline, anonymous function that is very useful. So why not call it that?
(*Spyder maintainer here*) There's an option to do precisely this. If you want in a per file basis, you need to go to the menu Run &gt; Configuration per file and select the option called `Execute in a dedicated console`. If you want this for all files you want to run, you need to go to the menu Tools &gt; Preferences &gt; Run and select the same option.
Yeah, but if you start from that angle, where do you stop? There are so many things that aren't named accurately, that ship has sailed at some point in the 1960s. And `anonymous_function` would be even more terrible than `lambda`.
Thanks for the feedback, I've done some reformatting so hopefully it's easier to follow.
The modules are marked for the versions they were introduced in. Here's a few examples: "abc": (2.6, 3.0), "argparse": (2.7, 3.2), "ast": (2.6, 3.0), "asyncio": (None, 3.4), I've thought about making it a "proper" package but initially I just wanted it to be the singular file "minpy.py" to be easy to copy to a project. However, will all the tests etc. it would make sense to make it a pacakge. Thanks.
You defined calc\_cals being 0 (an int) instead of a function, but you call it like a function.
Thank you.
Thank you. That's encouraging.
If you adjust to pep8 (there is a lot more to the pep than spaces) then repost to learnpython, you will get more deep feedback. One important benefit to pep is that you will actually get more responses than adjust to pep, as you've seen here.
True, `anonymous_function` wouldn't be ideal either, but we like to use `_` to denote an unused variable we don't want to name, so we could use that convention for an anonymous function: `def _(): ...`. We couldn't use `def` either because the scope is different, so we'd need another short word, or perhaps skip it entirely: `_(): ...`. For Python3 the ship has sailed, it shouldn't be changed now.
I find the self-promotion a little off-putting as well.
very true, good catch
It looks like you just naively ran `pip3 install scipy` outside of an environment, and it tried to install the modules globally. One cheap fix is to add "sudo" to the front of the command, ie `sudo pip3 install scipy`, to escalate your permissions, but this is considered bad practice and you may regret it later. Another approach that seems common, which should get you off the ground pretty quickly is to add the "--user" flag, so `pip3 install --user scipy` or some such--this should install the module somewhere in your home directory, so that it's global to you but not to everyone with a login to your system. The "right way" to do this, though, is to use environments. I'd suggest either looking into pipenv https://github.com/pypa/pipenv or, if you're working with data scientists, conda https://www.anaconda.com/download/ . Cheers!
So the entire point of this article... is 'We should change the name of "lambda" to something like "function"'? That it? That's quite a lot of words just to make such a simple point. Also... 1) The artcile doesn't make that point very well and 2) most people will really have no problem understanding the intention of a 'lambda' expression as being "to define an anonymous function".
Not sure if this is the right place to post this, but I have an Intro to Programming assignment due (Python) and I really need some help debugging the program. I had the flu last week so I missed a lot of class and need some help. If someone could help out, I’ll pay like $10-$15. I just want to understand what I’m doing wrong, without my grade suffering too heavily. If someone could help, I’d appreciate it!
Okay, thanks for letting me know. I really appreciate it :)
The current downside of programmatically defining your dependencies is that you have to run the code (setup.py) while a pipenv file does not seem to require running any code - it can even be parsed without the need to have Python running.
no this was very helpful, thank you!
ah alright thanks, Ill give it a shout, I added the function the hangs.
That's fair! I'll checkout parts 2 and 3 when they are published. I didn't mean to put you down or anything, it just struck me as very much a copy of some fabric functionality. I'm all for rolling your own stuff, but sometimes its a lot easier to use a battle tested library. 
FWIW, there are git bindings in Python which would let you do the large majority of this git stuff without using subprocess to call git.

Yeah I’ve had lots of issues with requests waiting forever for a response that will never come. It helps to add “timeout=10” (or some other number) to the requests.get call, because almost no valid response is going to take longer than 10 seconds. 
Exactly. This will make it look like the program is no longer responding. This is much more likely that a mysterious memory issue. 
It seems like a purely academic argument. I agree, however, that `lambda` syntax in Python is a very poor choice. That's one of the few things JS got right, especially with the `=&gt;` arrow notation.
That's not how that woks sadly.
I was wondering the same thing, [this](https://github.com/ray-project/ray/issues/642) is the best I could find.
I get it, but its a first draft to make sure it works. and if you read the post you'd know the conditionals wont be like that later. Just there because I'm not at that point yet, Trying to figure out why it hangs with too many urls to scrape but works perfectly fine with say 0-100 urls.
Note that in that comparison they did only one operation. One of Dask’s strengths seems to be lazy execution, building a computation graph and only computing the results when requested. This means that multiple operations can be carried out much more efficiently. Ray does greedy (eager?) execution, meaning that all results are computed right away. I would be interested to see a benchmark of an entire preprocessing pipeline.
You shouldn’t have to manually set that and instead you should run `source /path/to/venv/bin/activate` in a shell (on Mac or a Linux system, I forget the windows version of that). That should update the path prepending that python (and it’s site packages) for that individual shell session.

It does update the `$PATH` variable like you would expect. But I would also like for it to set the `$PYTHONPATH` variable, which will help with my project imports. To give a more concrete explanation of my setup, I have my virtual environments created in a `~/.venv` folder. When I run `source ~/.venv/bin/activate` it updates PATH so that I use the environment-specific `pip` and `python` binaries, for example. However my Project is out in `~/Projects/myproject`, and I'd like to add `~/Projects/myproject` to my `PYTHONPATH` environment variable, since it affects how Python finds modules when you `import` them.
Look into the `psutil` library. 
I don't know urwid very well, but probably "loop.run()" starts an infinte loop to handle all the inputs and so every time refresh is called you start another infinite loop. You should not create a new txt, fill and loop, but instead update the original txt object with "txt.setText(outputText)" and then "loop.set_alarm_in(1, refresh)"
My understanding is cmder is using conemu and clink and some other magic combined. Either way its all gravy baby!

I ended up finding the issue. As I was trying to return the python code out as html I was replacing /n with &lt;br&gt; for formatting purposes, only problem with that is that it was ruining the code within pygal. Moral of the story always watch for formatting issues I guess.
What does [P] stand for? Pandas?
You should check out Bee Ware (https://pybee.org/) and maybe you can help them with a donation.
Create your run script like this and you shouldn't have to source or set anything explicit: !#/bin/bash cd ~/Projects/myproject ~/.venv/bin/python myprog
I actually was planing to do something similar but with a CI updating the Data store
You can add that to the `bin/activate` I believe (see [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/4758351/1584762). Though generally I find it’s best to not fiddle with the PYTHONPATH manually and to either “install in editable” mode if it’s a library (`pip install -e /path`) or use relative imports if you can.

Thank you! I'm betting thats the problem because there is no specific spot it happens, may even be the web-page timing me out due to overloading. Its a fairly decent sized site, shouldn't be an issue for their servers. Ill let you know tomorrow if the timeout helps. I am gonna start running it now.
I love using pynsist on windows. It will make a true installer package, bundle python and the c++ runtime for machines without it, pip wheels if needed,etc. Adds a shortcut to the start menu as well. It does not make a single binary, however, it will unpack and link the install as python, so if code visibility is not possible for your end environment that can be a deal breaker, however if most of the end users will simply run the shortcut, it will work great. Very simple to use, and very effective. The automation and testing framework I built for my company is installed with this to our windows server VMs and allows me to easily install and get running.

Does tox do version detection?
Wow I wish I saw this earlier. Literally just finished packaging my program, making an installer script, and writing documentation before I opened this.
Hi guys! As a developer, I've always felt annoyed when it came to live collaborative development with other people, due to all the hassle around the process. Either I have to repetitively use git add, commit, push, pull (after all VCS like git are meant more for version control, not sync) or the tools that I already work with don't natively support live, collaborative development (making me use unfamiliar, web-based IDEs that do support live collaboration). So, over the weekend, I used Python to hack up Bolt: real-time file sync for teams, that automagically works with the tools that you already use. http://getbolt.herokuapp.com/ For example, if you use Sublime or Eclipse, you can simply "bolt" your project via the terminal, and you'll instantly be able to interactively code together with your team members (and see their code live), in real-time, while each of you can use your own tools. So, I built this because I thought this would make it easier for me to work on team projects together. I would love to hear your feedback on this! Thanks a lot guys!
Is pyenv not an option? 
Jesus Christ. Sick of seeing this being spammed in almost every programming related subreddit.
Sorry I'm late to the party but its worth checking out if not now for the future. Either way good luck!
Search the data line by line and remove the tags. A quick search pulls up an example. with open('in.txt') as infile, open('out.txt', 'w') as outfile: copy = False for line in infile: if line.strip() == "[START]": copy = True elif line.strip() == "[END]": copy = False elif copy: outfile.write(line) 
Literally read the side bar.
We have [a pretty long list of learning resources in the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/index#wiki_new_to_programming.3F). Try a few and see what resonates. For a brand new programmer I'd recommend codecademy. Also, if you don't have one already make sure you look for a project that interests you and start on it as soon as you can. Programming is a lot more fun if you have a goal. Come visit us in /r/learnpython if you get stuck. 
I would just pick one and split the data using it. For instance: data = raw_data.split('[END]') --- If you have more questions like this it's better to post them on /r/learnpython. Be sure to [format your code for reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/faq#wiki_how_do_i_format_code.3F) or use a site like pastebin. Also, include which version of python and what OS you are using. 
I cross-posed this here because the software suite is Python-based.
In addition to what has been posted, /r/learnprogramming also has a good FAQ.
Thank you so much! 
I know what tox does. It's very different to what this package does. It hardly seems worth comparing them.
Snarky bot
Did you indent the second line? Python is very particular. 
yes, the 1st part of the code works, the error occurs when i type is_divisible(6, 4) which should read false but its just giving me a error. 
Give us the entire error message
how would this work with vim? is vim sync'd to the file in the file system? would the changes show up live in vim if i have it open and my coworker edited the file?
Get it off of sourceforge for one
Array of lambda input questions could work but it's retarded
You're give me flashbacks of Perforce live view hell. I suppose web development is different, but I was on a large C++ app, where if the right header file was changed, it would take 4 HOURS to compile. Mostly because everyone was on a single server, and compiling at once. Luckily, I was a contractor, paid by the hour.
Try to use ncurses. However, it doesn't support Windows.
&gt; 15 November, 2017: Development of the Python sources has recently resumed using a a GitHub project and other resources and Shlomi Fish (@shlomif) has received an admin status on the SourceForge project and this site. A new source release which adds compatibility with Python version 3.x and some other improvements is expected soon. It's already on Github https://github.com/shlomif/PySolFC
That does not seem to work, AttributeError: 'Text' object has no attribute 'setText'
What processor do you have that needs PyCharm?
Nice ! Did it work ? you have the PIN now?
Try creating a list of Boolean values, each value corresponding to a question, and the question can change that value. Then have the questions check the list as a reference, no need to mess with while loops unnecessarily. I did something like this in a GUI I worked on for some option-style input and it worked pretty well
Looks interesting and potentially very useful! Could you put a section on the website describing how data is synced, encrypted, stored etc? If it was a "zero knowledge" service where nobody but the team members can access the data, then I could definitely see myself using it for commercial projects.
Not that I've tried, but I've heard Oracle made Java 32 bit illegal for JDK 9. If they wrote PyCharm using any Java 9 features, then there would be no way.
I'm sorry if it's really obvious but do you think you can show me a small example of how the code would look?
unfortunatley not. I had tried out around 3500 combinations when they changed the password. I cant login anymore
Just a thought: use Jinja for your report (email template). 
Cheers, that looks like it will come in handy. Especially if/when I decide to add more info in the reports
You're probably using Python 3, while Codecademy is using Python 2. Also, /r/learnpython.
Well then, go read twitters api? And word it properly then? Because your question means what it exactly means "How to gain followers", not "how to check how many twitter accounts exist at any given moment".
This is why I've stopped recommending codecademy for new python users. Using python 2 today is a bad idea. It's no longer developed and very soon will be officially deprecated in favor of python 3. It would be wise to start out at 3. Udemy has some good training, try there. Good luck and reach out in /r/learnpython if you have any questions along the way.
Your if and else are not in the same indentation.
[Pynsist](http://pynsist.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) might be able to help with this, but you'll need to either figure out a way to include tkinter, or go back to version 1.x and use the 'installer' format option for Python, which contains tkinter.
Udemy isn't free though so I would prefer to use codeacademy because its been easy to follow. So my question for you would be will it hurt to continue? In other words, if I am learning print len(word) and in Python 3 it is supposed to be print (len(word)) I till learn the concept and just need an extra set of parenthese so it is not like I am learning the wrong thing? Also I am also starting "Python the Hard Way" what do you think of that? 
Working on the same files at the same time seems like a terrible idea.
I believe gvim will notice file system changes, although maybe only if its window is un/focussed I'm not sure. Terminal vim will not notice by default. That said there are plugins that add this functionality even in terminal and you can also use and autocommand to check for filesystem changes often. Read up on `:checktime` and `autoread`
Codecademy will teach you basic data types and logic flow so it's not as if it will be harmful. It should give you the fundamentals. I would suggest that any code you write outside of their platform be translated to 3 though. Mostly you will be dealing with string encoding and print statements. There are quite a few good articles on the difference available on Google. Do not start writing your own personal scripts in Python 2. The shelf life will be fairly low and you'll eventually have to port it anyways if you keep using it. 
Because I didn't know there are generator expressions.
I think you’re misunderstanding the parentheses requirement. `print()` is a function just like `len()` is a function. Notice how there’s no space between the word print and the parentheses. In python 2, `print` was a statement, like `return` or `yield`, but in Python 3 it’s a function like any other, which means it receives arguments enclosed in parentheses. And yes, don’t spend time learning outdated syntax and language rules. Learn python 3. 
Hey, thanks for the feedback! We'll definitely update our website with more information! We just finished building the product (it's been a crazy time so far!), so we couldn't get around to improving the site yet. But thanks for the valuable feedback!! Bolt is a zero knowledge service, and doesn't actually store your data anywhere. So, only teams can access their data. We'll post more info on how Bolt works on our website very, very soon! In addition to providing a hosted service, we've also been getting a lot of requests for a self-hosted version for companies. So we'll be launching that in the upcoming week or so, which will allow you to run &amp; manage Bolt in your own company internally. Thank you very much for your interest! We'd love to give you early access when we launch in beta, so if you're interested, feel free to PM me or sign up with your email on our website! Thanks! 
Yup, Bolt will work with Vim! The changes would show up live (unless you temporarily pause bolt's sync - more info on this feature and the rest of the product soon!). We're currently applying the finishing touches to Bolt so that it can be publicly released in beta. So, when we launch in beta in the upcoming week, we'll have more info on this. But, to answer your question, yes! :) P.S. Do you think many developers use vim commonly at work? Would love to hear your thoughts.. ;)
Perfect, thanks for the clarification - I've signed up on the website now :)
Awesome, thanks! :D
I use Google Passwords for all of my password keeping. Is there any way to check it against those passwords?
Though it shows... if you have randomly generated passwords, knowing there is a breach is not so scary. You just know you were breached on one website, but that's no further fear. That is contrary to people who reuse passwords, for them it is a must to check :)
Thanks, it seems very useful. The results are very good (by its API compatibility with pandas when it is finished). However, in the git repository or documentation there is not more information about dataframe, I guess will be when it is finished. Great job! You have increased my interest over your library :-).
Isn't that one of the things the last pass security checks does? It checks your passwords against leaked databases.
You're doing god's work son
If you are using virtualenvwrapper you can set environment variables in a postactivate script, as mentioned here https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9554087/setting-an-environment-variable-in-virtualenv Elsewhere you mention you want to do this to help with your project imports. If these are projects with a setup.py, just install them in your virtualenv (or if you want to use them where they are - use python setup.py develop ) If they don't have a setup.py, I recommend adding one.
Yes, although I think they use some other solution than this, because LastPass couldn't detect a lot of my compromised stuff, that haveibeenpwned could. 
Only in the last year or so I finally bit the bullet and changed most of my passwords to randomly generated ones. I've checked my old passwords I've been reusing and most of them are compromised at this point :D
Stupid question? I this website 100% legit? Is it a good idea to send them your passwords?
So the website actually never gets the password at all, as the hashes are calculated locally? Also if you use the password field on the site
Honestly, I haven't gone through all of the javascript on the site, so I can't tell you 100% that they are not doing anything fishy elsewhere. But yes, they use the same method with hashing locally and sending only that to the server.
passwords.google.com
Found the solution, had to change the refresh method to this. def refresh(_loop,_data): outputTxt = ['COMP3 ', (red_bg, 'DOWN '), "Bla\n"] outputTxt += ['COMP4 ', (green_bg, 'UP '), "Bla bla\n"] txt.set_text(outputTxt) loop.set_alarm_in(1,refresh) So it seems kwelzel was right with his sugestion, just needed the right syntax for the set_test method.
Ah okay cool
The lastpass implementation is very poor. It claimed my passwords were great when I know at least one of them is in a leak and absolutely awful.
Oops, the name of the function is "set_text" and not "setText". I'm sorry
if self.config.hostsToPing[0] is '' and len(self.config.hostsToPing) is 1: I think the == operator would be more appropriate here rather than the is operator. More info: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13650293/understanding-pythons-is-operator
Sorry I had a typo and could have phrased it better. How does it compare to other password managers such as lastpass, bitwarden or keep adding?
Sounds like you might want to look at [celery](http://www.celeryproject.org/).
But lastpass has a build-in function to check for compromised passwords?
It does, but it's not good compared to haveibeenpwned. Some of my passwords that were compromised don't show up during the lastpass security check, but they show up if I search them through haveibeenpwned.
This response deserves an upvote if for no other reason than the chuckle it causes.
It is absolutely not a good idea.
Is it just me or does the code not work? It seems that there might be a line missing after the print('''Be patient please, it will take approx. {0.hours} hours {0.minutes} minutes {0.seconds} seconds to query for of your {1} entries.'''.format(total, number_of_accounts)) part 
You seem to have lost this: /s
oh yeah! i would love to share my passwords with someone i do not trust at all! sign me up!
and your code, per-se, does not send the plain password anywhere either if I'm not mistaken, no? response = self.get('https://api.pwnedpasswords.com/range/{}'.format(hsh[:5]))
That's kind of strange to hear, because one of their competitors, 1Password, [literally uses haveibeenpwned in their backend now](https://blog.agilebits.com/2018/02/22/finding-pwned-passwords-with-1password/).
I feel like in the time it you to write the script, you could have changed all of your passwords to long randomly generated strings via LastPass and you would be in a way better position. If your passwords are setup correctly you never have to worry about checking a database. Its a waste of time. by the time haveibeenpwned knows about it, so does the CISO of the web service that was storing your credentials. By that point you would have received an apologetic email asking you to reset your password. 
Nope, you are correct. I'll fix it asap
Care to elaborate?
It would be hard for you to learn Python programming language if you do not like snakes. Let me ask you one question, do you have a real phobia for snakes? This would be bad news for you as the language and most of its components have been named after Python the snake. A little background study of Python programming language reveals that its naming system was based on a study of snakes. Do not give up hope, you can still be able to learn programming and that is through studying other programming languages other than Python programming language. Therefore, I urge you to go to a good programming school like Holberton School (https://www.holbertonschool.com/) where you can get taught various programming languages of your choice. You will be able to program proficiently on finishing the course and thus you do not have to study Python Programming language if you have a phobia for snakes. In any other case, you could look for way to deal with your phobia for snakes. Otherwise, studying python will not require you to deal with live snakes, just the names of various types of snakes and that is it. Good luck and I wish you all the best. 
About "learn python the hard way", it's not a traditional book where you read a bunch of stuff, and then you have some exercises 10 pages later. Instead, it's a book that assists you in discovering the language. If you get through the book and you do everything he says, there's no doubt in my mind that you'll know a fair bit about python. Even though I think it's a good book, I don't think it's for everyone. Contrary to what the title says, it's not hard, but it's also not the kind book that holds your hand all the way through. So you can start it, and see if it works for you. People don't recommend this book too much anymore, because at one point there was some... heated arguments between the author and its critics. It's probably still a bit controversial. But hey, who cares about flame wars.
Most likely because you'll be entering your LastPass master password in this python script to get your vault passwords. This might be intercepted along the way. Then again, OP might be a shady person trying to get all your passwords, too - whilst checking the pass, he might just send a plaintext copy of it to another website/service. As far as I can tell, that's not happening (went through some of the code in github).
The passwords are not sent away from your machine. [You can read the article describing the password checking](https://www.troyhunt.com/ive-just-launched-pwned-passwords-version-2#cloudflareprivacyandkanonymity)
hi mr. stallman!
&gt; I feel like in the time it you to write the script, you could have changed all of your passwords to long randomly generated strings via LastPass and you would be in a way better position. I have 322 accounts in my lastpass vault and while some of them probably useless, it would still take me a while to change all of them and that would work only for this once. &gt; By that point you would have received an apologetic email asking you to reset your password. That presumes they all actually do that (and some of the more reputable companies of course do). My personal email address was listed in 6 different pastes according to the haveibeenpwned site and I remember only 1 such apologetic email - that was Dropbox a few years ago. Other large one was last.fm and that was a breach from 2012 that was made public in 2016. Other 4 are some random services I haven't been using...
Post your code, so that we can help you better. Using while loops seems bad in this case. To be honest, you almost never need while loops in python. If you use nested while loops, when you break, it breaks only from one loop, so that is probably why you always get back to the first question. You can do something like this : answer = input("question 1 : yes/no?\n") if answer == "no": return answer = input("question 2 : yes/no ?\n") if answer == "no": return
Hence why I said it was nit picky. I have run around saying misconceptions for weeks at new jobs and in school in the past. Maybe the person telling me what I was saying was silly would seem like an asshole for that moment, but eventually I would have appreciated it over the embarrassment of saying that misconception to everyone for 2 weeks. But sure whatever, think whatever you want of me. 
I was deciding to use PyCharm but now I am using Sublime Text 3
So if they are random services you haven't been using, what exactly is the issue? If they are breached and you compartmentalized properly you shouldn't give a shit. And I have 248 accounts, so what? If you have accounts you don't use you should be deleting those anyways. It took me 3 hours to change all my passwords and it's a one time thing. LastPass even auto changes a lot of passwords You want to be secure or lazy? Well guess what, spending a few hours writing a script like this gets you neither. If you compartmentalize, use 2FA, use strong passwords, configure LastPass correctly and perform scheduled security reviews you will get WAY more out of your time than writing a script to automate a useless task. Anyone with basic security knowledge and common sense will see how futile this is. There are hundreds of breaches that occur every year without them ever being publicized so a cute online database won't do shit. It's a nice concept, but nothing more. Down vote away. 
&gt; the list of lists obtained by merging the lists of xs without an element with those of ys without an element I think it will become a lot clearer is if you describe this in accurate English on /r/learnpython where homework questions belong.
It is mortifying that you have so many down votes. It is never a good idea to share your password with a third party, full stop. You should be extra dubious when someone offers to verify that your passwords, it is literally one of the most common phishing vectors.
The site does the same thing - you can check yourself in the developer console.
&gt; ery year without them What about all the people who might use this script, too? Does it become time well spent if 10 people use it? What about 100 then? Does there have to be a clear benefit behind investing 3-4 hours other than wanting to learn something new, the joy of coding, helping others? I for one have enjoyed looking at the code at hand and might've learned something here and there. I'm grateful that he wrote the code. + Do you change your 200+ passwords every day? Because you might use this script daily as it takes a minute to run.
If it doesn't support main 3 platforms it shouldn't be talked about :)
Should be pointed out that there are two popular ways of computing a PCA. You can do an eigendecomposition of the covariance matrix (as in the link), or with an SVD (singular-value decomposition) of the centered data matrix. There's a tradeoff between the two. SVD can be expected to be slower for very large data sets (many variables), but has superior numerical stability properties. Depending on the sort of data under consideration, it's not a given that the eigendecomposition method is suitable.
Stop calling these replies `threats`. You're being wayyy too sensitive about it.
Him posting his code in this case is where it wouldn't really help, using lists for this is just plain dumb. Check my reply.
Just wanted to say I agree with you on the redundancy of checking for compromised passwords. You should be changing your passwords (even crazy secure ones) on a scheduled basis. You should assume your information is already compromised and carry out a security plan. Just my opinion though. To each their own.
Why does it use split columns for only some of the blocks?
You are literally just taking someone's word that it's safe. The only way to know for sure is to look at the code yourself, or trust someone else whose looked at it, and people shouldn't just trust a few redditors that may have no idea what they are talking about or could be sock puppets. If someone is concerned that their passwords are compromised, the are better off just regularly changing them.
You can just find torrent link on reddit and download whole database to your computer, then preform checks localy. :-)
It's good that you asked this. A bad actor will definitely answer you honestly. 
You don't share your passwords, hell you don't even share the entire hash. [Go educate yourself](https://www.troyhunt.com/ive-just-launched-pwned-passwords-version-2/).
1000 people doing a useless thing is no more useful than 1 person doing a useless thing. Don't listen to me though. The first rule of security is to assume you are operating in a compromised environment. If you can somehow reconcile this strategy with this Golden rule then I guess more power to you. You can put lipstick on your pig all you want but in the end you are still fucking a pig.

Stfu you pretentious fuck, OP already replied with a link.
Your best bet is to get your feet wet in a startup. A lot of bigger corporations will disqualify you simply because you don't have a degree. Hands-on, paid (even if not that much) experience will set you apart and increase your chances. Look into Wiretap... the guys over there are really cool and they may have a need for your skillset. Reach out to people on LinkedIn, make it a point to let others know what meetups you'll be attending (meetup.com). Networking is how you will get every job you get from now on. Even if you apply online... REACH out to internal HR/someone on the team (linkedin) and verify they got your application. You can never be too needy; you're helping them do their job at that point. Get an online portfolio going, github, etc. Best of luck. Once you cook up a resume, let me know. I'd be more than happy to spread the word.
You're missing my point - most likely deliberately. I'm not discussing the security aspect's of the code. I was referring to your very narrow-minded comment about the 'waste of time' coding this. As I stated earlier, there's no time waste here - OP exercised some coding, lots of redditors can look it through, learn from it, perhaps even use it for their purposes. You can leave your tinfoil hat on, though - more power to you :)
can't you use a numpy array instead of a list of lists? + vectorized functions instead of loops. 
&gt; the other 35 characters of the hash are missing. Not if they're in the reply from the range check.
Even if we assume the best of intentions, how do you know somebody else won't (or haven't already) hack(ed) the service? If _"Have i been pwned?"_ won't provide the database to download, there might be something going on in the background, probably they're collecting other data you unknowingly provide.
You're right about that, but not really relevant to what we're discussing. We're discussing the efficacy of his work, not the merit of publishing the work itself. If you don't want your work criticized from all perspectives than maybe don't publish it online.
I feel like sending a hashed value of every password give them a massive database that they could work backwards from to determine the actual password. Plus if they know the password “CAT” generates a hash “12345” and it has been compromised, then if someone sends them their hashed password and it’s “12345” then now they know your password is “CAT”. 
TIL about haveibeenpwned.com FML...
You're right. Password managers are the devil. /s I personally write all my code in ASM (gotta prevent that malicious compiler) and mint my own silicon (sneaky RISC-V) to prevent having to trust bad actors. Eventually you have to trust someone. Troy Hunt is a good example of someone who has earned the trust of a lot of people, especially within the security community. 
Wow, you seem like a lovely person.
You are not sending the whole hash though, just first few characters
You may want to check Julien Danjou's [book "Scaling Python"](https://scaling-python.com/), which presents several ways to use your cores (local or remote) efficiently, and more...
Most hashes are way longer than 5 characters
I suggest stripping off the count, sorting the hashes, and converting them to binary. Gets you from 29GB that needs to be searched linearly to a 9GB file you can binary search. If space is tight you can also strip off the end of the hash - e.g. 6.75GB by making it 16 instead of 20 bytes, or throw it in a bloom filter (2.5GB for 1 in a billion false-positives).
But that still does nothing. It's a list of hashed strings, that's it. You would have to specifically target someone that you'd already had information on(emails/usernames etc), crack all of the returned hashes, and just try them all on all of the services you think that user was signed up for. BUT THAT DOESN'T MATTER. This is an **HTTPS** endpoint! There is no increased security risk when properly using this end point. 
bash one-liner to check if your password is pwned by hashing, submitting the hash and checking the response `(echo -n "Password: "; read -s pw; curl -s https://api.pwnedpasswords.com/range/$(echo -n $pw | shasum | cut -b 1-5) | grep $(echo -n $pw | shasum | cut -b 6-40 | tr a-f A-F))`
yes, it's still one of the most common editors in the business.
I can, but would that actually improve performance? Testing things with Numpy gave me weird-looking graphs, so I'd need to play around with it.
There are so many handwriting recognition tutorials already... Something else would be more helpful, maybe a neural net that plays a game noone has automated before 
Just finished a python module that converts an excel workbook to an python code object, never again
You're using rhetoric not logic. * Using proprietary software like LastPass to store your passwords is not a good idea When a products entire purpose is to secure your secrets there is close to zero chance of them doing anything nefarious as they would be found out extremely quickly and destroy all user trust in their service. Thus have no customers. * Proprietary software cannot be trusted This is an extremest mindset. Just because some proprietary software does nefarious stuff does not mean all proprietary does. * This places all of your trust on a company and cannot be audited. They have regular audits and respond very quickly to any security issues that are reported by researchers. For me that is good enough. * KeePassXC Does not have android or iOS clients, it doesn't have browser plugins, , it doesn't support 2FA, and it doesn't handle syncing across devices (so you have to use something like dropbox which negates the purpose or run your own sync infrastructure). TL;DR Don't negotiate with terrorists.
I'm interested in learning more computer science with it eventually leading into artificial intelligence. I've been working through Guttag's *Introduction to Computation and Programming Using Python*, and I'm enjoying it quite a bit. 
It makes a lot of assumptions about the way its clients will do things, and they're not very good assumptions IMO. It is easily extensible by subclassing, but I thought my use-cases were simple enough that I shouldn't have had to write my own subclass and re-implement the SMTP stuff.
:)
You used rhetoric in your arguments there too. Dropbox is one way to sync passwords. If the file is properly encrypted, any method of sharing should work.

That's what most of the people recomend. Kivy. I Saw what it can do on andriod (Mainly games) and i am pleased with the output. I might use this one.
Huh? Maybe this makes sense for some projects (i.e. maybe a website or documentation?), but real-time sync seems like an absolute nightmare for any actual programming language that requires a particular state for compilation/testing/execution (i.e. If I am editing a piece of a larger C/Java/Python/whatever program, then I can't test any code changes in real-time, much less in any kind of deterministic fashion unless everyone else working on that same project is coincidentally also at a stable point in the code at that exact moment in time). That is why software versioning tools all have the concept of checking out (files/branches/etc.) a local (a.k.a. non-realtime) copy and then a conflict resolution step (merging, rebasing, etc.) at a single discrete later point in time.

Try /r/learnpython. Show them the code you have and describe where you are stuck. Be sure to [format your code for reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/faq#wiki_how_do_i_format_code.3F) or use a site like pastebin. Also, include which version of python and what OS you are using. That said: a "invalid syntax" often means you forgot to close a parenthesis on the previous line.

I'm making flat dark themes for jupyterlab, I now how have a great environement ! (the original dark theme was a little too black and contrasted). However I don't know how to make an extension out of this.
There should be a comma before NumberOfMonths, i think you missed it
Awesome, thanks; I'll give that a shot. Any suggestions for easily getting that into a numpy array? 
You're welcome. If you do decide to use this, someone has been figuring out how to include Tkinter with Pynsist 2.1 [on this Github issue](https://github.com/takluyver/pynsist/issues/124#issuecomment-370384973). I'm hoping to get that turned into an example in the repository.

To everybody concerned about security - the password databases HIBP uses are freely available for download on the website, so you can hack a script that does it 100% securely (locally) on your own, and it shouldn’t take you more than an hour including downloading the 9GB repo.
Hi! Thanks for your comment. Your link points to the PySol FC main repository under my account (= "@shlomif" as the URL indicates) which predates the request and subsequent granting of admin status on the pysolfc project on sourceforge.net (also by me, and I am grateful for the SourceForge.net admins for granting me that because the previous maintainer became in active for many years). Right now I use a mixture of GitHub and SF.net resources, but they are all under the umbrella of myself and other contributors, so there is nothing to worry about. Sorry if I made the wrong impression.
LastPass keeping the data secure isn't the only concern. It also relies on browser extensions and browsers are notoriously not great at keeping things tight on that end. The LastPass blog even has a number of posts about updating the browser extension due to exploits. That is never an issue with a local database using a standalone client. If you're ok with the added risk of a browser extension you can add that but it's not required for something like KeePassXC where it is with LastPass. Then there is the issue of non-browser based logings. LP can't fill those for you as it's tied to the browser. They sort of have a solution but it's Windows only.
Which doesn't happen here.
Thanks, I did not see that
Use other sources of data. How about you collect data of New York Department of Sanitation and see the correlation. What are the borough with most sightings per capita? Does old building attract more rats? What about poorer neighborhoods? Neighborhoods with more families? Can you see patterns of appearance by month? Create your hypotheses and analyse the data. After your analysis and conclusions there are numerous what you can display the data. Choropleth Map comes to mind in this case or you can try other [ideas](https://datavizcatalogue.com/). Check [NYC Open Data](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/) for more sources.
If you’re not matching the full hash value, then how can you be sure the password is actually compromised? A high false positive rate in this case isn’t necessarily a bad thing but I’m just not sure why you would go through the effort if you could just as easily change your password. Also, if you have the hash value of all these known passwords, then couldn’t you quickly generate the hash of billions of random passwords and simply find the ones that match? If anything else was collected like an email address, then it could be more efficient than a brute force attack on a random account. I’m not trying to bash this by any means. I’m just curious and trying to understand. 
I've always was worried about that. Did not know that. Thanks
Gotcha, that makes sense now. Sounds similar to how the Brave browser achieves ad-matching locally, client-slide without actually revealing your browsing data to a third party. Thanks. 
I agree with you but most of these, except the fact that he's new, is his problem. He didn't really specify what exactly needs to happen. And yeah, I said that it's not a simple problem, but I hope he'll notice that picking a right structure (later if he'll keep learning) can make his work easier. And I don't know, I think he could understand it in a few weeks if he tried.
Hi! Thanks for your reply. I should note that as far as I know the original PySol FC project (which in turn was based on the original PySol and a fork called UltraSol which also became unmaintained) predated both Git and GitHub, and it was the original initiator (not me) choice back then to use SF.net and Subversion, which were solid and popular choices back then. He also decided to use a sourceforge.net CNAME as its homepage and we are stuck with that decision for now (though we can redirect it to a different domain in the future). Moreover, note that we are now using a [GitHub repo](https://github.com/shlomif/PySolFC) for the source code, pull-requests, tracking issues, as well as CI/CD services such as Travis-CI and AppVeyor. It is linked from the SF.net project page. I am still hosting the homepage on SF.net to please search engines, and also still use SF.net for the project downloads because using it is easier for both me and for downstream packagers (I speak from my experience as a packager and contributor for [Mageia](https://www.mageia.org/en/) ). Note that while there was an issue recently that the sourceforge downloads were tampered with some software that was considered malware, that was reverted and SF changed management since. I also realise that SF.net has fallen out of fashion in favour of source code hosts such as GitHub, and while I also like and use GitHub, I still find SF superior in some respects, and can use both hostings at the same time for the services they are good at. Even if I found SF inferior in all respects, transitions like this take time and cannot be done all at once. There is still [a lot of COBOL code out there](https://blog.codinghorror.com/cobol-everywhere-and-nowhere/) and while most programmers seem to detest it, it is [too time-consuming and costly to rewrite](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/04/06/things-you-should-never-do-part-i/) right away and a lot of it is still out there being maintained. Hope it helps, and feel free to contribute using the GitHub resources or other resources you see fit. Git being distributed I can also pull changes from a non-GH repo, or accept patches or patch sets, and I can be [reached](http://www.shlomifish.org/me/contact-me/) in most conceivable online means.

&gt;The LastPass blog even has a number of posts about updating the browser extension due to exploits. Apple, Windows, Linux, etc... all have had security exploits announced and patched, many, many times. This is pretty standard. Everything has some level of vulnerability. &gt;That is never an issue with a local database using a standalone client. See above. Your risk may be lower, but it still exists. There is no such thing as a perfectly secure system. Assuming any software or hardware is not vulnerable to exploits is hubris (KeePassXC has had at least one potential exploit found and fixed as well). Also it is relevant is that a local database is not very useful in a world where many of us have multiple devices. This is the reason LastPass exists. It's a trade off. The joke is that the most secure hardware is a rock. As soon as you create hardware and software and start letting users do anything, you have vulnerabilities.
Very nice article! I love the helpful pictures, actual source code and how informative, and well-written it was. Always nice to see some cool uses of ngrok as well :)
They are using well-established, open source, extremely scrutinized encryption standards. There's no opportunity to create a backdoor unless all of our encryption standards are bunk (this is extremely unlikely; and if it is the case then none of this matters anyway as they would have access to your passwords directly on the target sites). Additionally, browser extension code is exposed and thus gets reviewed (hence how previous exploits were discovered by researchers). Finally, server side data cannot expose any of a user's stored data - it's encrypted. They can get your e-mail address and a hashed version of your password (105,000 passes...). Regardless, if a major government (namely, the US) wants your data that badly, they have far more persuasive physical and legal means by which to obtain it.

&gt; Edit: Guys!!! I'm wrong. It's a good idea to send your passwords to a third party website. I'm so sorry. I've made a terrible mistake. I will share all my passwords from now on. Thanks, bye! The password isn't sent to a third party website. The author posted a link to the github repo FFS. If that doesn't work for you, then go read the API. If that still is too much work, then simply search for news articles regarding haveibeenpwned.com where you'll see tons citing the new api functionality that eliminates the need to the full password/hash.
I know how it works. The guy asked if he should send his passwords, I said no.

Then you're being intentionally obtuse. Context matters.
[`uuid`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/uuid.html)
&gt;There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things. Allocate a giant range (eg 1000 items) for each category, and let your ActionType constants enumeration be sparse. Allocate from the not-used-yet bits in the middle whenever possible. Or let the value-numbers be an implementation detail, and don't worry about what they happen to look like. Order by category. 
`and` returns the first value if either of them isn't considered "truthful"; `False`, `0`, `0.0` and `''` are such values. It returns the second value if both evaluate to "truthful" values. `or` returns whichever value is truthful; if both are, it returns the one on the left.
First you need to know that all python objects can be treated as a boolean. Which boolean they evaluate as depends on the value. For integers, 0 is treated like False, and all other values are treated as True. `and` and `or` are just operators. [From the docs](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#boolean-operations): &gt; The expression `x and y` first evaluates x; if x is false, its value is returned; otherwise, y is evaluated and the resulting value is returned. &gt; The expression `x or y` first evaluates x; if x is true, its value is returned; otherwise, y is evaluated and the resulting value is returned. --- If you have more questions like this it's better to post them on /r/learnpython.

Also, include which version of python and what OS you are using. 
These questions are better asked on /r/learnpython You could think of `or` and `and` as def or_(a, b): if a: return a return b def and_(a, b): if a: return b return a ... except the `b` is not evaluated if it's not necessary.
Would it maybe be a good idea to delete the variable that stores the password variable at the end of the one-liner?
And is a boolean operation, which means it works on True and False. The truth table for and is: True and True is True True and Flase is False False and True is False Flase and False is False As far as I know you can't do boolean operations on non boolean expressions in Python. You can pm me if you'd like, but I mostly use mobile so it might take me awhile to notice the messages.
But we don't know how our passwords are being stored. They might be lowercased and then hashed, salted and then hashed, etc. Surely this only works for very bad password management?
&gt; As far as I know you can't do boolean operations on non boolean expressions in Python. That is completely wrong. OP's code works just fine.
Obviously there is no such thing as a perfectly secure system. That doesn't mean people should ignore the bits that are naturally less secure. I have 2 laptops, a desktop and a phone. All of which have my Keepass synced.

No, not if you copy/paste that code directly and insert your password. It's wrapped in `()`, which opens a subshell, example: var_outer="outer" ( echo "inner var_outer: $var_outer" var_outer='outer set in inner' echo "inner var_outer: $var_outer" var_inner='inner' echo "inner var_inner: $var_inner" ) echo "var_outer: $var_outer" echo "var_inner: $var_inner" Execute that with any POSIX compliant shell an you'll get this output: &gt;sh ./example.sh inner var_outer: outer inner var_outer: outer set in inner inner var_inner: inner var_outer: outer var_inner: However create a new scope instead of a subshell and it yields this: &gt;dash ./example.bash inner var_outer: outer inner var_outer: outer set in inner inner var_inner: inner var_outer: outer set in inner var_inner: inner

The mechanism may not be clear, but the result is. In my experience it's much more helpful to beginners to provide tools to help them reach a goal than to dwell on developing and understanding the tools. I don't know about you, but I learned to drive a car before I learned how a car works. Hell much of that is still black magic to me. 
Awesome explanation, thanks for the link. I was finding that the 'is' was giving me unexpected results in other programs
I can conceed to that. It would be helpful to also provide a beginner friendly version that is easier for them to reason around. I think it can be overwhelming to some to be exposed to every feature of a language right off the bat without being able to relate it to something they already understand. d = {} for line in DataLines: key, value = line.split(',') d[key] = value
Figured it out, assigned the file to a variable and iterated through the variable rather than the file i was currently iterating over :)

hey i ran into this problem when i was making a morse code translator. problem was i didn't want to hard type in the {'A': ' ..-'} or whatever so i can a gigantic string of all the morse code alphabet. I then had to populate my dictionary appropriately so it became about parsing and indexing the gigantic string. x = 0 for i in nl: code[nl[x][0]] = nl[x][2::] x += 1 looks like that so it's basically about finding out where to seperate then turning it into the key and value of said key.

Jupypter is a tool. It isn’t a language or a framework. So if in your work you can go on without it, then don’t learn it. If your job ever require it, learn and use it in that context.

IPython (or Jupyter) is good for interacting in real time and saving an entire name space. A more general approach is to write python programs in files and invoke the python interpreter to run them. You will want to use some specialized mode for writing python code: https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonEditors
If you're looking for data science type jobs using Python, it's probably good to be familiar with Jupyter. Not every job will require it, but it's a pretty common tool. If what you want is more of a traditional developer job, e.g. building web applications, then it's not so important. It may still come up - especially in smaller companies, you could be doing a range of different tasks - but so might all sorts of other things you could spend your time learning about.
Ignore the asshat answers. [Read the dudes blog](https://www.troyhunt.com/ive-just-launched-pwned-passwords-version-2/). I'm not gonna say you _can_ trust him and his service but hopefully reading the absolute plethora of detail he's put on his blog about it will help you come to your own conclusion. If you don't trust the website but still want to use the service, you can query the API by doing a SHA1 of your password and sending the first 5 chars of that, and what you'll get in return is a list of SHA1 hashes that have the same initial substring. All possible combinations of those first 5 chars are in the db, the minimum count of hashes you'll get in return is like 400 and the average is 500. This makes it harder for whoever controls the service to determine a password. Finally, you could just download the SHA1 database yourself and query it directly.

Hello there. I wanted to share with you my first python project =) is a command line tool that creates python packages (or any other languaje because uses a template system). I think is very easy to use, but, as i am new in this, i cant be so sure. You can check it out installing it (pip install do-pack) or enter the github project page (https://github.com/wilfredinni/do-pack) and help me improve with your opinion on how it works or the way i coded it. The idea is to have a project ready structure with the setup.py, AUTHORS.rst and .gitignore with the user imputs, and choose a license, or simply get an empty project structure, or use a template to make wherever project skeleton you need. thank you. 
They probably collect the data themselves. Lots of leaked password lists out there.
[I've read an article](https://www.passwordping.com/lastpass-selects-passwordping-for-compromised-credential-screening/) where they explain they use PasswordPing API for checking the accounts. But I think the difference is that they only check for breached usernames, not the passwords.
PS: Every programming language you know has this issue. You can't get rid of this issue. As long as you have a finite amount of memory, you will run into such errors at some level, irrespective of how cleverly you code it.

&gt; If the function is static and can be defined outside of the parent function it should be. It's cleaner and makes it reusable as well as more readable for others looking at your code. IMO bollocks. Unless you plan to reuse or are "exporting" the function, it might as well stay inside it's "context" (textual, not execution). What you are saying is akin to "Don't you make it a @staticmethod, push it out of tha class, you will make it reusable".

Hey! I have written a script for a restock monitor. I have finished it but the proxies are not working for me, the format for the proxies are in parentheses (http://username:password@proxyurl:proxyport). It would be great if someone could help me. I am looking to add more features to the script. The monitor runs 24/7 that can catch restocks as soon as possible when stock is loaded onto a website, when a product page is available, and automatically, with the most minimal delay possible, send that information (The Item Loaded and the corresponding link) to to my discord or slack channel. I would also love for it to be configurable so that I am able to add in additional sites (100+ Shopify, adidas, Supreme and many more.) I would also love to be able to filter what gets shown on the Discord Channel (keywords possibly) as I don't want to get spammed with an obnoxious amount of information from stock loading on the websites I would like to track. I want to also add proxy’s so I won’t get banned from the site. This information is very important to users that resell sneakers and they need the most up-to-date information about a site loading stock on the backend that is available on the front end, or just having an early link to purchase from before everyone else. If you want some more information, please DM me and I can provide more detailed sites and the file.

This. The guy behind HIBP released it a while ago. People just don't generally want to download and maintain a 9 GB db. This API is primarily suggested for use as part of the password reset or account creation process so that you are sending partial hashes of passwords that are not in use. 
&gt; You're running into a fundamental flaw in IEEE 754 floating point math. The addition is correct, it's just not the kind of addition you think it is. Its not a flaw in IEEE 754 -- in fact, IEEE 754 guarantees that for at least simple arithmetic, any such errors are the absolute minimum possible. (It promises to return correctly rounded results for single arithmetic operations.) This is a problem with **all** fixed-size floating point arithmetic -- and compared to the mess we had before the adoption of IEEE-754, the current situation is a pleasure. I remember one mainframe where `x == 0` could evaluate as false, and `1/x` crash with a Divide By Zero error. Oh the joys of numerical programming in the bad old days before IEEE 754. &gt; If decimal accuracy is more important than performance, then use the decimal module. Please don't encourage the myth that decimal floats are immune to these sorts of round-off and precision errors. They're not. The advantage to decimal is that it matches the way we write numbers, so `Decimal("0.1")` is *precisely* the decimal number one tenth, unlike the float `0.1` which is the 64-bit binary number closest to one tenth. 
Using a [line collection](https://matplotlib.org/gallery/shapes_and_collections/line_collection.html) and reformatting your lists of lists into numpy arrays will buy you a lot of performance. Assuming you have two lists of lists, x, y = np.asarray(x), np.asarray(y) xxyy = np.stack((x, y), axis=2) lc = mpl.collections.LineCollection(xxyy) # can customize... fig, ax = plt.subplots() ax.add_collection(lc) plt.savefig('out.png') Not using a GUI renderer + numpy + a collection will probably buy you something like a 100x performance boost here. That said, 100,000 lines is far beyond what matplotlib was designed for, and is generally a ton for any plotting library. Avoid using vector output formats, or anything in general that doesn't allow the output to be blitted. Rasters like png, jpg, etc, will avoid this image destroying the device that tries to display it.

If you’re unsure about what’s going on with it, don’t use it. If you don’t know about variable scoping, don’t use it. If you’re basically familiar with programming and can spend a minute and figure out what the critical bit of code is doing, and realize that it’s secure relative to all of the other places that you enter your password, then you can send it. Acting like it’s ludicrous for anyone to use something like this, is ludicrous.
Dude that is some mega shell scripting skills. I’ve been a developer for several years and am quite competent, and have never seen anyone spawn a sub shell like that. Granted, I typically stick to simple bash scripts if I need to write one, but that’s cool knowledge.
django-cookiecutter seems reasonable enough, if everything works as labelled. The rest of your questions, though, are more focused towards server administration. Docker lets you save images of your containers. Hosting your own docker image repository service would let you sync those images back and forth. Alternatively you could probably manually copy a docker image from one machine to another. Looks like it has docker-compose so you can link everything together and back it all up with builtin functionality. Configuring more robust backups would be an exercise for the reader.
Don’t overthink the problem, make sure master branch of your gut repo is the version you want live, let ansible do the rest then you don’t need to keep changing your ansible playbook with version number or over complicate what it’s doing :-) 
No
&gt; Trusting a third party website is even more dubious, because you need to trust it every time you use it. Well it's pretty damn good that they made a system so you don't have to trust them, then! And if you actually read up on things you'd realize that. But hey, much easier to just double down and continue arguing.
