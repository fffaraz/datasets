No hurt feelings involved here, but I am on a mission, as you say, to properly inform the ignorant, which is the majority of the population when it comes to the technology that encompasses their day-to-day life. You should program an "AI" to append the TL;DR to your responses to my comments as it seems it might save you some time as it's your goto initial response in a conversation over your head or that you deem not worth your time.
Awesome project. You should upgrade it to livestream. Like those lofi channels. But isn't this just waiting for a takedown notice? Despite speeding up the songs 30%, you don't actually own any of them.
I use pip-tools to generate a requirements.txt file based on the `install_requires` parameter inside a setup.py file and then use pex to package it into something portable I can deploy. https://packaging.python.org/discussions/install-requires-vs-requirements/ https://github.com/jazzband/pip-tools https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex
This won't work if you desire [reproducible builds](https://reproducible-builds.org), since each time you run `pip install` you may get a different transitive set of dependencies.
What other IDEs have you tried (for Python) in the past? I use WebStorm at work, and Android Studio for hobbying, and really love Intellij. For now I use VS Code for Python, but want to change to PyCharm. What made your life easier with it?
I made a bit of progress. I don’t think adding the suits is necessary since only the value matters to the game. I made a list like this: (1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3.....) since there are four of each value up to thirteen. And then shuffled the list. Then I made a variable n=0 to do the counting. I checked if the value of the card matched position n. If it’s a match I removed n+1 objects from the front of the list, then set n=0 again. And if not I added 1 to n to check the next position. I figured that i just need to do that thirteen times to cover all outcomes. I think I can add checking if the list has a length of 0 to see if the game is won when it gets a match.
Look up definition of subset and then read your comment again.
When I set up a new system I install anaconda and leave the stock python for the OS only
I mean, depending on the amount that they care, if you're running a script like this it'd be pretty easy to see your IP downloading a ton of videos and streaming them back via livestream.
amazing :OO
That's a terrible argument IMO, because the new signature is horrific. They have stuffed print full of cruft that's rarely ever used. Print was meant for throwing out some text in the screen, if you're worrying about the performance impact of flushing you should be using something else. And you can specify an arbitrary file to write to now? Then it's not really a *print* function anymore, is it? It's a *write* function. It should be called *write*. And pray tell, why is the write function not scoped to the file? my_file.write(x) is shorter but more readable than print(x, file=my_file) Why are we making things less explicit in a way that makes the code longer and more complex? The new print is an abomination. They added a bunch of bloat that is rarely used as an excuse for turning a statement into a function, for purely aesthetic reasons. They should have let print be a simple debug tool only for writing things to a screen without fancy formating, and they should have used something like os.stdout.write(a,b,c, sep='\0', flush=True) for the power use case.
Just to warn you, Nightcore is definitely not fair-use of the source content and thus is gonna be copyright infringement. You might be able to get away with it if you don't monetize any of the videos, but monetization of this content is definitely illegal.
And don't forget the unicode vs str vs bytes shuffle. The difference is all of those things made the language significantly better, whereas "fixing" print is a huge annoyance with very little to show for in the way of payoff.
It's a web scrapper?
I put the word subset into quotations to comply his/her word choice. Technically subset would work in my comment since carbon is a part of a larger group of related things (elements), and organic compounds are made up of other elements, so therefore subset applys correctly. I'm not sure why I'm being downvoted when true AI doesn't exist. I'm sure there have to be other people here that are sick and tired of reading the product descriptions when looking for a new IT solution, and companies throwaround AI like it's going out of style to try and seem like they are somehow ahead of the competition when at best they have ML in place and not the all-encompassing AI running the show.
"specify an arbitrary file" has always been part of `print`. `write` does something completely different and it woulnd't make sense to confuse them.
When I want python on a machine just to try out ideas, scrape the web, or munge big piles of numbers/text in files or databases, I throw anaconda at it. It's the epitome of batteries included, with a side order of spare batteries and jumper cables. For "serious" projects, I tend to use pyenv to create separate virtual environments.
I like little mini-challenges like this which is why I wrote this out for you. Hopefully you can learn from it as you start your journey in learning Python. I wrote this to be pretty basic (i.e. no cool magic tricks, just straight logical code) so that you'll be more likely to understand what it's doing. I also wrote it down and dirty (no error checking). At any rate, I ran this through a number of different rounds, and finally tried 100 rounds where I got 6 wins and 94 losses, so it is possible to win. &amp;#x200B; You'll need Python3 to run this. There's plenty of room for improvement, such as capturing which rounds were wins and which were losses, doing some averages etc. &amp;#x200B; At any rate, good luck on your coding journey. Take a look at The Python Workbook [https://www.amazon.com/Python-Workbook-Introduction-Exercises-Solutions/dp/3319142399](https://www.amazon.com/Python-Workbook-Introduction-Exercises-Solutions/dp/3319142399) which I found a valuable resource of exercises to do once I had the basics under my belt. &amp;#x200B; """ A quick down and dirty (no error checking) game of solitaire with the following rules: 1. Starting with a count of 1, flip a card and if the value of the card is the same value as your count e.g. a seven is flipped on the seventh flip, it's a match and you start your count over at 1 with a new pile. 2. If you get to count 13 and the card flipped is not a match (a king), then you pick up the cards, reshuffle and start over. 3. If you make it all the way through the deck and the value of the last card flipped is the same as your count, it's a WIN, otherwise it's a LOSS. """ import random def buildDeck(): deck = [] # Since this game of solitaire doesn't care what the suit is, we don't # need to define a seven of spades.

Thanks for the info, that library will be very handy in the future.
Use pip freeze and create a requirements.txt
If by "always" you mean "added to Python 2.0", then sure. IMO, it was a mistake to add it, though.
At first i extracted all the game data from a resource file (with a tool that i found online). Then i took a look at the map files, which were pretty obvious because they were named like the towns/fields/dungeons ingame. The format is pretty simple and was not that hard to figure out. I converted the data a little so it would be more convenient for me to use. Next I implemented the pathfinding on the map data I had gathered (originally in python). Then I started scanning the games memory. First I looked for the characters position on the map. There's a chat command called "/where" which returns an integer tuple (x, y) of your position. It was extremely easy to find in memory using cheat engine. With that position I knew where my character is on the map. I now had to translate between my data representation and mouse position on screen in order to generate mouse clicks and make the character move to a new position. The character in Ragnarok Online is always in the center of the screen, so that was fairly straightforward to implement. After i got that working the bot was able to move around the map. The character position i was reading wasn't quite good enough though, because while moving the character's position was between cells, which would not be represented in the tuple (100,100) -&gt; (100,101). That lead to pretty clunky behavior from the bot, because it didn't have the actual screen/map position. I knew the game had to display the sprites between two cells though, so i assumed there would likely be a float or double representation of the characters position on the map as well. I searched for that and soon found it (did it by starting at a position, walking in a direction and searching for a variable that increased/decreased accordingly). Found it pretty fast. Afterwards the bot movement was great :) Finding the map coordinates of monsters was pretty similar. I chose a mob that does not move by itself, but could be pushed in a direction with a skill. That way i again searched for it's position and found it quickly. Since it's likely that the monsters data is stored in some struct or something i looked for what could have been the starting point of the data belonging to the monster and with some experimenting i was pretty sure i found the base pointer. Searched for that in memory and found what turned out to be a doubly-linked list of entities (monsters, players, npcs, shops, etc.) currently on the screen. At this point i had enough data to implement fighting logic. To make clicking stuff more reliable i also came up with the idea of looking for the mouse pointer sprite (which changes when you hover different kinds of entities). You get kind of creative as soon as you get the hang of finding stuff in memory :D
I still need to learn about all the the code under python. This post also served to give me some info on it .
Yeah, it's scrapes the "Title" search results page on IMDB for search results, and then displays the info of grabbed of the selected movie/show page. Eventually I'll get it funtioning as a proper module that can be included into other programs and has functions for returning any needed movie / cast and crew information.
This is brilliant! I appreciate you taking the time to type it all out! Thanks
I wrote about how I achieved this with a Flask app here: https://realpython.com/offline-python-deployments-with-docker/ Basically: 1. Spin up docker containers that match the production environments locally 2. Install the dependencies with the containers 3. Pull out the wheel files 4. Create tarballs with the wheels and application code for each environment
No problem. It was fun for me to play with it. Now, I'll continue on with optimizing it, maybe throwing out some colors on matches, restarts etc.
Thanks, but I am already aware. A lot of Nightcore channels sprinkle one or two royalty free songs into every weeks batch of videos. I am not monetized yet so I don't have to worry about this but my current solution is using a automatic song remixer.
There you go! 3/4 of the battle is figuring out the logic. Then it's just a matter of applying the correct syntax.

Wow that's nice. What library do you use? Beautifulsoup?
Thank you! I'll check out the vids. Any advice on how to get started with version control and which one to use? Any good links for testing?
Think Python was great! When I have a bit more time I want to do his books Think Stats, Think Bayes, and Think Complexity. &amp;#x200B; Actually, I started a Hitchhiker's Guide to Python a few weeks ago, and it's been great so far, but I got distracted with some other work so your message is a good reminder to finish it.
you are very welcome. that line is basically checking to see if ur running the script directly or importing it as a module. when u run the script directly the variable __name__, becomes __main__ basically this gives ur script the functionlity of being a standalone script ot a module other scripts can import and use functions from.
I learn things from studying different peoples code like in packages and also stack overflow
Correct, I'm using the requests library to get the HTML and Beautifulsoup4 to parse it.
Thanks! I was anticipating someone asking about this so here you go: Seq2Seq stands for "sequence to sequence". Sequences are just chains of data, like text or RGB values. GANs are a type of ML algorithm that take in sequence and output a sequence, hence seq2seq. GANs can take in a sequence like text and output a sequence like an image, for example, \[making bird images based on descriptions\]([https://becominghuman.ai/understanding-and-building-generative-adversarial-networks-gans-8de7c1dc0e25](https://becominghuman.ai/understanding-and-building-generative-adversarial-networks-gans-8de7c1dc0e25)), or creating an image that matches the tone of a song's lyrics. I created a data mining program that got the top watched Nightcore songs' thumbnails and lyrics, and trained the GAN to guess the thumbnail for a songs lyrics. Based on lyrics, it created its own very blurry and abstract thumbnails which could then be used to identify an actual image that would suit the songs' lyrics.
I need to start thinking ifs not machine learning when I see AI.
1. Thanks! 2. Livestreaming sounds great, but I have no clue how to make one of those. 3. Takedowns haven't been a problem yet.
Thanks! If you'd like to help monetize the channel, subscribe!
I have an application that I wrote (really just a gui over some scripts) that processes data from one of our metrology machines so QA can input the data into their databases (we're not set up for automation on that front yet). I also have another program that creates and formats some printouts that we use at the actual machines that make the parts. I have to deploy and maintain these programs across 6 different PCs. Doing this gets me such a small amount of appreciation from my bosses, and programming is such a small portion of my job, that I refuse to spend a chunk of time making sure that I keep 7 different python installations on 7 different PCs (6 plus my PC) synced every time I want to update a package that I use. Bundling into an EXE that just runs is ten thousand times easier.
Thanks! I checked the link out and the PDF and it looks interesting! You asked for feedback so the first thing I might say is it would be nice if your table of contents described a bit more what each "game" is supposed to teach. As in what programming concepts. That way a person can skip more basic stuff and go straight to the games which are more relevant to what they want to learn.
Can you come to my work and explain to 20 people how to do this? These people are between the ages of 25 and 65, many of them do not have a formal education, and sometimes getting them to save files into the correct directories (linked on the desktop) is a bit of a challenge. I can get these people to click on an exe and select the files they just saved to the desktop. Anything beyond that is pretty tricky.
Great project, i doubt you can monetize on that legally tho unless granted some rights......
Yes, you're bring unreasonable. Python is not a fully compiled language. You're making it more difficult on yourself completely arbitrarily. Pip isn't "running" anything on the server when it's not installing a package.
Sure add a `pip freeze` if that's desired but I'd start with plain old pip instead of everything else being offered here until I could sort out my install issues
So uh, you got this in a github or something?
Use Docker to build the deployable image. With multi-stage builds, you start with a build image that has pip and all the compiler deps to install packages, then you simply copy over the built artifacts and installed packages to a fresh python-enabled image. &amp;#x200B; With apt or distro packages, you're at the mercy of the distro to package everything -- and to keep things up to date as security updates come out, and on and on. Use \`pip\`, use a requirements.txt and pin your packages, but make the app deployable with a docker image.
U should use some type of threading while getting the info and parsing the results. Great code!
There is a bot account called /u/TotesMessenger which, any time a post is crossposted, goes back to the original thread and leaves a comment saying it was crossposted. Recently someone apparently set up their own Python subreddit which crossposts basically everything from /r/python, which means every /r/python comment thread now has the crosspost-notification bot showing up. The request is to ban that bot account from /r/python since it's just spam at this point (and also reddit itself will show you where else something was posted, if you want to know).
Love the artwork. A little bug that i found, the final text overlaps and you can't read it
No.
I’ve been installing miniconda recently. Save yourself the GBs of packages you’re never going to use.
Keep in mind that youtube-dl violates YouTube's Terms of Service: see [https://www.youtube.com/static?template=terms](https://www.youtube.com/static?template=terms). In particular, this violates section 5B ("You shall not download any Content unless you see a 'download' or similar link displayed by YouTube on the Service for that Content").
My main concern (which I didn't explain but should have) is that pip, build-essential, etc are all potential security exploits. When you deploy a PHP app, despite it's weaknesses, is just a bunch of files that can be sftp'd to the server. There is no large list of dependencies to getting it deployed. &amp;#x200B; But that being said, if an attacker got far enough that they could access the compiler, then it is irreverent that there is a compiler or not.

Hmm. Should I edit my post saying I totally don't use youtube-dl?

Carbon is not a compound.
The absolute simplest solution would be to use the `--target` option with pip as you develop locally, and place all your dependencies inside your project and check all your dependencies into your repo, or a sister submodule repo. It’s messy, and not ideal, and everyone is gonna explain in post after post why this is a bad idea, but at the end of the day it’s your project. There are definitely some advantages security-wise to not letting your production server download arbitrary code off the internet (but there are other better ways to handle that like hosting your own pip-able repos or using Docker). So, basically, here’s the gun if you want to shoot your foot.
I'm Making a Python Module called Eebuilder. You can use it to write source code for websites. &amp;#x200B; [Github Repository](https://github.com/SuperMeteorite/Eebuilder) [PyPI Package](https://pypi.org/project/Eebuilder/)
As someone who used to listen to it, yeah it's not for everyone. I was into it(as in refused to listen to anything but the Nightcore version of any song) during those awkward times in highschool when I was also watching nothing but anime... Looking back on it that whole time was so cringy. Now I will listen to maybe one or two Nightcore songs every now and then
Besides Google, I use the official documentation often. *Very* occasionally, I'll look at the source code.
No he's calling everything AI because ML is a subset of AI (AI is bigger than ML). In your comment, you were complaining how he was calling everything ML, which he did not do ("people don't go around calling all organic compounds carbon"). Using your analogy, he's calling carbon an organic compound.
Where did I ever say that it was? Carbon is part of all organic matter, is what I said, so in that context it is technically a compound, or subset, of a larger group of elements. Nobody can find flaws in my arguments related to AI being misused in lieu of ML, so they keep incorrectly try finding flaws in my comments?
Lol i don't mind making a couple of PRs for this, great work really 👌💯
I don't see where I complained that they were calling everything ML. I did say that they were calling everything AI. Their logic was that because ML is a subset of AI, we should just call everything that is ML by AI instead. My analogy with carbon and organic compounds was to show that just because carbon is a subset of what makes up all organic compounds/matter, we don't just refer to the element carbon as an organic compound due to that being incorrect. There is a reason we have AI and ML as separate descriptors in our language, because they are not correctly interchangeable. OP made something great, and I wish OP the best with their project. I just wanted to correct the continual misuse of AI in our society right now. OP's program cannot be accurately classified as an AI since it is using ML-algorithms to perform what is a sliver of true AI.
You said "but people don't go around calling all organic compounds carbon". With organic compounds representing AI and carbon representing ML, you're saying that for all AI, he's just calling it ML.
Looks like hex.
Actually, `pip` is becoming quite ubiquitous these days! Even for non pythonic stuff, devs are using it on linux simply as a distribution mechanism. In fact, all recent 3.x builds of windows and mac ship with `pip` built-in! I certainly don't think its a bloat. Nevertheless, if you want to keep things minimal, you have a few versions: 1. Use your linux package manager's equivalent (`apt install python3-django`, for example). 2. Download the tar/zip/build versions of individual components (django and/or wagtail) separately, simply copy it to your source or app folder and serve it. But the thing is that you'll need something like `gunicorn` or `uwsgi` too in order to serve the app efficiently, isn't it? You might need something else like pytest or pylint in future to streamline deployments too, isn't it? So, the best way is to simply install pip and make your life easier!
I see my mistake now. Thank you for pointing that out. That aside though since you now know what I meant, can we agree that ML shouldn't be incorrectly called AI just because it falls under the umbrella of AI?
I use a word document to track all the reusable code I can use (1600 pages so far) and Google Sheets to track class references or methods.
My friend showed me my error. Such a tiny mistake that I'll look out for next time. Thank you!
&gt; Bundling whole installer is not necessary. Completely disagree. This is the age of containerization, if you're not delivering a completely self contained executable then you need to be shipping the entire software stack as well one way or another
Using a similar analogy like you, you have a square, but you call it a rectangle. In my opinion it's not incorrect, but it is better to be specific and call it ML rather than AI as AI can mean so many different things.
This is just semantics, in this case "interpretes vs compiled" is just a stand in for "Python vs everything else"
There are a number of python programs packaged using apt; here is the guide: [https://www.debian.org/doc/packaging-manuals/python-policy/programs.html#current\_version\_progs](https://www.debian.org/doc/packaging-manuals/python-policy/programs.html#current_version_progs)
Also worth mentioning that you can get the ISO required to run a Windows VM for free from Microsoft; https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10
10 years and I'm still learning new things. For example, I never dug deep into introspection in the past, and it's a very powerful tool. Also Python 3 recently introduced static type checking... And then there's some stuff I always Google or copy and paste, like a basic PyQt skeleton. But if it's just a hello world program, some basic control structures and OOP, you can learn to get this error free in a few days
That is a good analogy, and I appreciate the beneficial feedback and civil discussion on this topic. I felt like I was in The Twilight zone until now or being trolled/gas lighting going on. I know there isn't really a set definition of AI, and that it's always changing as we learn, so I'm open to being wrong on this and having fallacies in my arguments in my previous comments. What I learned in school (did not go for spefically a degree specializing in DL, ML, or AI by any means), my experience with the subject matter at work, and independent study of the topic is what lead me to my belief on the matter.

&gt; When you deploy a PHP app, despite it's weaknesses, is just a bunch of files that can be sftp'd to the server. python apps are just a bunch of files. there's nothing special about php. it's just that servers usually come pre-configured. if you use a framework, there's also certain steps for php apps beyond just putting the files on the server &gt; There is no large list of dependencies to getting it deployed. php apps can require dependencies just like any other language. some even require c extensions to be compiled &gt; But that being said, if an attacker got far enough that they could access the compiler, then I guess it's irrelevant that there is a compiler or not. that is the correct perspective. you're over thinking this
I'd say for the different IP just configure requests to use a different free proxy. Selenium can help if the website is too dependent on Javascript. I haven't found a good python OCR for the input so that may need to be manual if you can't find it.
If carbon is not a compound, it cannot be a member in the set of compounds. Carbon is an element, compounds cannot be composed of a single element.
How would I print a specific bit then? I’m trying to do that but I can’t get it to work
Ha, thanks for the gun! Thanks for this though, its an interesting method.
I don't think it could be a function and still retain the ability to [disable assertions](https://docs.python.org/3.7/reference/simple_stmts.html#assert).
Um, I dunno, maybe by reading a post in which you say "first gets the lyrics and audio for the nightcore video using youtube-dl".
True, but they could have made it backward compatible where the interpreter parsed print x, y, z as print(x, y, z) This would still have allowed for the use of print as a function and the addition of optional arguments.
I said that carbon is part of all organic compounds, which implies that it is not a compound on its own until it joins one or more elements to make the organic compounds. Carbon is an element. Elements are a set, or subset, of a compound. Hence why I used the also used the term subset in my analogy or carbon (element/subset) and organic compounds (compound). Compounds are formed when two or more elements are chemically joined. https://www.nyu.edu/pages/mathmol/textbook/compounds.html I must be missing a mistake in an earlier comment(s) of mine or you are misunderstanding my comment(s).
I imagine, though, for library developers fixing `print` wasn't much of an issue. And I'd bet that after a few years of Python 3 being released, any library that was being held back by only print statements was probably dead in terms of development.
No problem, good luck with your learning. This is a very big part of learning about data types, especially because python uses implicit data types.
every time I used import machine, got error not found. I thought the library is not available but I did not find any option to install the library for this.
My head of department just started using the word 'synergy' like it's something new, not an outdated, abused term that is now used ironically. I cringe every time
Sorry, I edited my comment while you were replying. You said: &gt; Carbon is a "subset" of all organic compounds Not by any conventional definition of subset, though you're free to define that word as you like.
My head of department just started using the word 'synergy' like it's something new, not an outdated, abused term that is now used ironically. I cringe every time
Here is the definition of subset that I was going off of: https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/subset How is an element not a subset of a larger set, which is compounds, in my example since compounds are two or more elements?
Not saying that I can't be wrong, I just thought that I was following the definition of subset with its use in my analogy. Willing to learn from my mistake though if I made one.
Because the members of the set of organic compounds is compounds, but carbon is not a member of the set of compounds, so it cannot be a member of the set of organic compounds. A monatomic compound is a contradiction.
just use git and github unless you have strong reasons to go against the crowd. There are tons of resources out there. &amp;#x200B; I don't know the best getting started video, but I like to watch this 2007 Google Tech Talk about git by Linus Torvalds. This was a couple years before git took over the world, so it's fun watching the creator talk about the concepts and motivations of distributed version control. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XpnKHJAok8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XpnKHJAok8)
That makes sense now. I wasn't aware that organic compounds were themselves made up of more than one compound to meet the definition requirement.
All compounds start off as elements though, so couldn't carbon just be considered a sub-subset of the compounds in organic compounds? (not trying to argue, just asking out of curiosity)

No, and this was a bit tricky for me to wrap my head around studying chemistry. This isn't the best metaphor to explain it, but it's almost like saying that since 'you are what you eat', and you just had a cheeseburger, you are a cow. Haha, I hope that helps, it's really not great.
It’s a byte array.
Good job man keep up!

This is what I get for trying to use an analogy outside of my area of expertise, IT, ha. I was never strong with the study of chemistry, and never took organic chemistry (avoided that hell, from what I've heard). Thank you for the information and being pleasant about correcting me.
How would I print a single byte from that array? Thank you

Only the first number will be random,in this scenario, since subsequent numbers must make the original number meet the constant.
b = b'something' b\[0\]
Make each value sum/n and remove from them randomly until the sum is correct? Just my first thought, probably not ideal.

Generate two random numbers between 0 - 1. Assume 0.2, 0.5. 0.2 -&gt; 20% of your constant value. Leaving 80% left. 0.5 -&gt; 50% of 80%, which is 40%. There is 40% left. Stats: 20%, 40%, 40% = 100% \* your constant.

Normalize after you generate the numbers. You could multiply by some factor A so that (Ax + At + Az + ... ) = constant.

Hey man, thank you for the question. The difference is that this software is: 1) Python based. Most used lang by now which gives wide opportunity for contributions. It's also platform independent. 2) In this world where even the thinnest piece of software has tons of dependencies (JS world), this has none. When you install it it copies 6 files to your harddrive each about ~50 lines of code in average. 3) I do personaly use it every day hence I maintain it at least for my own good. It's not abandoned and I keep adding new features (some are under construction). "Todo app" is one of the most widespread concept for apps but also the one with most abandoned apps. 4) I'm aiming to keep the app simple and sane. On the other hand I would like to add features like Google Tasks integration or sharing tasks ower the network. If I will be lucky I might get some help from contributors. 5) Yes, this is not the competition. I learned a lot from Python included batteries which helped me to keep dependency counter to 0. I'm not forcing anyone to use it I'm just advertising my humble work. I also don't run for the project of the year but I might get some Github stars over the time. Stay safe.
Definitely colors are on the todo list haha. I don't use icons in my term but I'm more than open for coop on this feature.
Good luck 😊😊👍👍
sounds like you want somebody to work for free :/
not to sound negative, but monetization is not a factor in fair use and copyright claims. neither does remixing constitute fair use in the vast majority of cases.
Roll stats using a method that will statistically produce the sum you're trying to reach. When you're done, determine how far you are from the target number. Then create a loop that will run the number of times you need to reach your target number. Inside the loop, randomly pick a stat and either increase or reduce it depending on which you need to do to reach your constant.
Thanks u/_IPA_ - there are indeed a bunch of crash logs in there from python3.6. The crash seems to be related to `dyld2`, but I’m unsure at this point how to debug further.
Nice.
Good job, you should reach to a famous music producer.
I'm confused, do you want to use the two variables 'lat_google' and 'long_google' as the start and stop of the loop? if that's the case, do: &gt; for i in range(lat_google, long_google):
/r/learnpython and read the sidebar

Please pick a License ASAP. It is very important to protect your copyright or that someone doesn't steals your work... It is also useful for making sure you are not liable for anything that this might be used for. I recommend MIT or 3-claus BSD but don't let it be with implicit copyright like this (might even be considered public domain depending on country) Other than that, really cool project. Thanks for sharing.
I don't think you appreciate the polite nudges these guys are giving you so let me give you a blunt one: Don't be an asshole. You don't have the rights to this music, and tweaking it slightly does not give you the right to monetize it. You might get away with it, you might not. Either way you'd be an ass to try. &amp;#x200B; This is a neat project, but monetization should never be a part of it.

ok, but what do you need the machine library for? in zerynth there is no such module because it is not needed and all "low level" stuff are exposed by other means.
Do you have more info on the errors? Maybe related to stronger Notarization rules in 10.15.
Normalize it Imagine your n random numbers as a n-dim vector v and it'll be obvious that you can bring their sum to 1 by doing v/sum(v) which you can scale up to whatever number x you want by doing x•v/sum(v)

* Create a list of random stats * Add all stats together * Divide each stat by that total * Multiply each stat by the constant * Turn each stat into an integer * Add all the stats together * Subtract that total from the constant * Add the couple leftover points from the last step to the smallest stat If you want, you can come up with several ways of creating the first list of stats... * Truly random * Divide half the constant evenly and radomize the rest * Assign one or two stats and randomize the rest
It's not about having sympathy for Eilish. It's about following a law which protects many, much smaller content producers. If the law is habitually ignored for large artists, it creates a precedent that will hurt all artists.

There's no way to answer these time questions meaningfully, as everyone is different. Just give it a go and start learning. You'll find out soon enough. However, I will say that a year is a pretty decent amount of time to learn a ton of python and related technologies.

This is how you deploy serverless apps too. If it works for serverless, it can work for servers. To avoid cross-compilation issues for compiled dependencies, you can install the requirements using a CI image that has the same platform you're deploying to.

Using a web scrapper I think is not safe at all... they can change markup of position of the elements and your scrapper won't work anymore.. also is slow because downloading the whole page... and they can add recaptchas or something to prevent non-human interaction.

mh actually both would work if they are a bit faster then my script and more robust. what would be the command for both? but still got some questions if I use bytes.... I would have the problem that the amount of measurements could potentially differ right? is it possible to load the file first, put a frame on it and then extract the timer with which I would set up the time intervall (according to the time in the frame) in which I would want to update / read? &amp;#x200B; would the algorithm be a closed/finished loop? as i said, I want to use the measurement in an AI algorithm. e.g. I want to have the measurements for 3s and run it through the algorithm and when its done I want the dataset to be updated to contain the measurements for 4s and run the algorithm afterwards.... I know i could run the AI in a freaking big for loop but this doesnt seem like an elegant way. and i read somewhere to avoid big loops

This article is a steaming pile of crap if I have ever seen one. Python is easy to debug? "PHPs advantage is that it runs on different OSes"? WUT?
Make does much more than that (dependencies, macros, parallel execution,...). For a single source file project it is easier to just export a variable or write a simple script - that will be faster than running Python. If you think seriously about writing C programs, I recommend getting yourself familiar with build systems like Autotools.
Yeah I know. I had started breaking my project out in to more files and went looking at make then got bored and wrote this so I could go back to my project.

You're thinking of a derivative work which have been successfully litigated in the music industry for ages. This is most noticeable in beat making with samples, where producers must clear even incredibly short samples that end up sounding nothing like the original. Art and fashion is one industry where derivative works are frequent and more difficult to litigate
The project seems really cool, getting so many different things and using all of them to make something like this creative, I can only imagine the time you must have spent on stackoverflow and reading documentation, also projects like these really make the beauty of python stand out.

Yikes. I wouldn't have passed some of my CS classes were it not for videos from "East Indian people with hardly understandable accents", and I'm sure that's true for many people here. Leave that casual racism at the door or you won't go very far.

I noticed that the ldc didn't reset when you ran out of cards but did not have a match. So it wouldn't run correctly until the next restart, but I just added ldc = 1 to "LOSS" chunk near the bottom.
It's absolute bollocks, this article. I could do a long rant about how wrong it is but let's just pick up one factual error: Python is older than PHP by five years, but considering both are 20+ yrs old that has no bearing why should you pick up one over another. Whoever wrote this is wrong and produced a bad article and should feel bad. OP, if you wrote this, shame on you. If you just found this and posted maybe you need to read up on a lot of things first.

If so something like the following might help import pandas as pd from uszipcode import SearchEngine search = SearchEngine() df = pd.DataFrame({ 'lat': [+39.122229,+38.122229,+38.122229], 'lon': [-77.133578,-78.133578,-79.133578] }) fields = ['zipcode', 'population', 'population_density', 'housing_units', 'occupied_housing_units', 'median_home_value', 'median_household_income'] def reverse_geo(row): results = [vars(x) for x in search.by_coordinates(row.lat, row.lon, radius=10, returns=1)] return pd.DataFrame(results, index=[row.name])[fields] pd.concat(df.apply(reverse_geo, axis=1).tolist()).to_dict(orient='list') (remove .to\_dict to keep as a DataFrame)

I just started programming python today. I made a button that clicks on and off. Hoping to make a little video camera program on raspberry pi this week! Python is pretty excellent
Meaning?
I am leaving this community. With all you upper-crust Silicon Valley idiots. You wouldn’t know about racism if it bit you on the butt. What are you another one of those overprivledged white people who are so afraid of offending minorities with your left wing liberal white guilt?

Thanks for saying it up front. Monetising this seems wrong in multiple ways
Provide a full path to the file. As for the missing modules, run the script with `&lt;interpreter you use&gt; -v script.py` and see what directories are searched during imports.
If your python file looks for "example.txt" it will be looking for it from where cron runs, not where your script runs. The simple fix is to throw a cd on the front. * * * * * cd /path/to/folder; python script.py
print("variable") ?
Fyi you cant legally upload the content it has nothing to do with whether you monetize it or not
Yeah I figgired somthing simalar to this just recently I used cd ... &amp;&amp; python3 script.py
Thanks, I'll look into doing that, I mostly started this as a way to learn how to make HTTP requests and use CSS tags successfully. It's cool to also learn better ways future proof projects like this.
This sounds more like a math problem than a coding problem. From what I understand, each shuffle already defines a win or lose. So simulating each game is unnecessary if you can just look at the order of the cards before hand. You don't want to simulate each game in any case, as there are around 8e67 different shuffles of a deck of cards. You could probably estimate how many shuffles result in a win from the rules, but I'm not confident I 100% follow your description.
I'm always looking to learn new technologies, and haven't worked with an API yet, so I'll definitely have to look into it. This project initially started as a way to learn how to make HTTP requests and then parse the HTTP for what I needed, moving forward I'll take everyone's suggestions and make it all a much better program.
I am so curious about the code o.o
The "dir()" command returns with list of available variables in the scope.
Good advise, I want to the project to be freely available for everyone to modify and distribute however they please, but I'm sure there's advantage to clearly stating that through license selection. &amp;#x200B; What kind of liabilities might be associated with not picking a license on a project like this? I want to keep myself self safe in the future.
I didn't mean that. These are just a few variables, but I have almost 100. I wanted to make some kind of function to print just the names and not doing it one by one. Thanks
It is now.
 average_person_mass = (70, "average_person_mass ") earth_gravity = (9.80665, "earth_gravity ") earth_mass = (5.97e+24, "earth_mass ") earth_moon_distance = (3.844e+8, "earth_moon_distance ") earth_radius = (6371000, "earth_radius ") earth_sun_distance = (1.496e+11, "earth_sun_distance ") G = (6.67e-11, "G") names = (average_person_mass, earth_gravity, earth_mass, earth_moon_distance, \ earth_radius, earth_sun_distance, G) for i in names: print(i[1], i[0]) This is what I do.
It's all doable. Break it down in bite size chunks. Pull the data that gets graphed. Create the matplotlib code for the graph. Once you have the graphs looking the way you want and saving them, start looking at how to send an email. Build each step in the process.
I like pip-tools. I'm surprised that it doesn't come up more in the pipenv vs. poerty debate. Would like a simple too that wrapped pip, pip-tools and venv to make it as convenient as pipenv
&gt;GUI I think that the question was about GUI in Python, not about web backend frameworks.
PyQt 5 is just a newer version. Actually, you have to be familiar wit Qt Framework itself. PyQt is a set of language-specific bindings.
I would focus on git 100% for the next while. Install it on your system and read this https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2 It's not that hard to learn but you need to take the time to let it sink in. After you start getting even a basic understanding you will wonder how you ever lived without it.
Thanks, I'll definitely look into this moving forward. This started as a small project for learning about HTTP requests and parsing, but I want to do things the right way as I move forward and build up the library. I guess my next mission is learning how to properly interact with and API.
I hope to see the source code. Good project !
@PinocchioStoryKanye, that is a very great project. Can i ask u in which language you are going to write the algorithm?

Covers are fine because the copyright doesn't apply to the song but the particular performance of it. That's why there's a million cover bands, they don't even have to ask permission or pay a cent to exist.
Yes this is true and besides that, Udemy is totally unnecessary. You could go to pythonprogramming.net (the author also has a YouTube channel called 'Sentdex') Or you could Google the Ebook "automate the boring stuff". In any case, try to refrain from using Udemy. It saves you money which you really don't need to spend in this case and you don't support there bad practices. Side note: Udemy actually stole content from the above mentioned author!

I would use this: for name in dir(): if not name.startswith('_'): print(name) The second line filters out things like `__doc__`, `__builtins__`, etc.
&gt; and also reddit itself will show you where else something was posted, if you want to know). Only if you crosspost the official way, if you just copy the URL and post it elsewhere, Reddit doesn't connect those two Still, I think banning the bot is a good idea.
:]
HTML/CSS/JS then? Cross platform, scales to many display sizes, zero installation, etc. I wouldn't do frontend in Python but I like it for the backend serving that UI.
Nice. You should avoid using the variable 'type' in the last functions for loop as this is a python built in. Use something like mov_type or other variable.
Learning the OMDB API is a good next step. What's more, OMDB's license will make your software much more usable. Depending on your legislation you'll probably get away with scraping IMDB data even though they don't like it, but that doesn't give you a license to make anything public out of that data. With OMDB, things [are very clear](https://www.omdb.org/content/Copyright) and you may use the data for any purpose, provided you cite its source.
....no. ChristianMingle was sued by gay couple because it did not have search for same-sex dating options.
I've been experimenting with lots of code snippets and writing posts for my Python blog, just finished code snippets vol 25. https://stevepython.wordpress.com/2019/07/15/python-code-snippets-25 and I'm now about to start a GUI project using google translate, which may or may not work out. I haven't even got in mind exactly what I'm going to do with it yet. After that I hope to do snippet vol 26 before the week is out.
No. It also removes some fluff.
Everyone's banging the "just learn Make" drum, but I can dig it. nice demonstration of quick/dirty/effective work.
This is cool! 1. I would recommend implement Notes as separate classes, like this: &amp;#8203; class Note: dev __sub__(self, other): ... def __eq__(self, other): return self.steps == other.steps class C(Note): steps = 0 # number of tones starting from the beginning of the scale class Csharp(Note): steps = 1 class Dminor(Note): steps = 1 and so on With classes you can implement some math on the notes, like subtracting (`C - D == Interval(steps=2)`) or addition (`C + Interval.MAJOR_THIRDS == E`, you can use this in functions that returns chords) 2. I would refactor functions that returns a scale for different modes into function that returns a scale with shift from the start of an intervals var and functions like `ionian` that just calls it with a shift. Like this: def ionian(): return scale(shift=0) def dorian() return scale(shift=1) 3. Using a PEP8 is always a good idea for open source code. And may be some tests, too :)
I mean whole installer is not necessary. Just packaging what needed makes sense in some cases. Ex: PyQt application doesnt need tkinter DLLs.
Nice work! :) Do you know the library [`imdbpy`](https://github.com/alberanid/imdbpy)?
If my end user knows how to download just a module and install it then I don't need to package things at all they can just install from source or pip. &amp;#x200B; If I'm making software for non-developers (Small office/school, etc), I'd rather they don't need to worry what is Python at all.

This isn't quite right, there are separate copyrights for the performance of a piece of music and the piece of music itself. Cover bands don't have to pay to play live as the written copyright is covered by the venue's PRS licence fee, however if a cover track is released on an ep or on YouTube then it may be taken down (or the artist may be sued) if they haven't paid for a licence to use the song.

That's great, I never considered the fact that scraping data could lead to any issues considering the fact that the information is freely available to begin with. Thanks for the heads up, and for showing me a solution to the potential problem.
If you like using Python for building, dislike make (who doesn't?) and outgrow your homegrown solution then maybe picking up [SCons](https://scons.org/) would be one approach? But your solution is a nice and simple way to get shit done, respect for that.
Good catch, I don't know how I missed the syntax highlighting there. I'm glad I posted this here, I've gotten a lot of good advise for moving forward.
I had no clue that existed. It looks like someone's already beaten me to all of this, lol
Why did you make the choice of nightcore? It's copyright infringement quite often and is quite unpopular. I'd be interested to know your reasons
Thanks for your reply, I'm pretty new so I'll try to re-phrase my question: &amp;#x200B; I have a dataframe that includes lat and long (floats), and I want to create lists from the coordinates. The search.by\_coordinates function requires two positional arguments. My question is how can I loop through the dataframe to get the corresponding search results for each of the results in my dataframe.
 Because of this problem with matplotlib and wxpython, I’ve created my own solution. Macnolo https://github.com/tfmoraes/macnolo . It downloads the packages from homebrew and pip, reallocate all shared libs and keep the structure of folders (/lib, /share, ...).
Yes, it is a dataframe. The columns are floats.
You probably want to go over to /r/learnpython
Keep at it, once you grasp the basic programming concepts (and learning how to google properly) learning new things like web scraping, image processing, etc. feels relatively easy. If you aren't already aware of Automate the Boring Stuff with Python, I highly recommend it, and it can be found free on their official site here: [https://automatetheboringstuff.com/#toc](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/#toc) . Almost everything I needed for this project was taught in the Web Scraping chapter. &amp;#x200B; (I will warn that when I first stared programming, the end of chapter exercises made me want to pull my hair out, but that's only because I hadn't learned how to properly google at that point).
Thank you im adding this site to my list too. &lt;3
&gt; Leave that casual racism No casual racism here. There's a veritable plague of low quality heavily accented barely understandable 'tutorial' videos produced by folks from India. It's my understanding that part of India's education system encourages the production of these videos. If that's the case then this is about the culture of the nation from which Indians come from, not something innate to people of the Indian race.
Thank you so much! I appreciate your guidance. This ended up working!
2 - 4 years but also I used it almost soley at my full time job AND I was in school the latter 2 years to learn concepts and delve deeper into why.

It's really not hard to imagine scenarios where you would want to do this. At work I write utilities/programs for electronic engineers to use in their Linux environment. This environment isn't something I have much control over. I can't modify the paths to include the directory for an entry point for all engineers across a dozen or so global locations. I can't execute pip in all of those environments either. These people aren't programmers so I'm not going to ask them to understand the concept of a virtual environment in order to execute the program. I'm also not going to pollute the global space with my program's dependencies. The list goes on. So the best solution is to generate a single file executable that can be placed in a more general purpose directory that's already part of their PATH variable.
Honestly just blacklisting bots referencing crossposts to /r/PythonLanguage would be better. TotesMessenger and Lolburger33 both do this.
Probably something like foo = arr\[ np.bitwise\_and( arr &lt; max , arr &gt; min ) \]

This post title is "convert py to exe". That's what I am referring to.
True the title specifically states '.exe'. But the discussion is more generally about converting to an executable.
Did you tried this: &lt;a href="/whenever\_route\_you\_want"&gt;My awesome logic trigger&lt;/a&gt; And inside [routes.py](https://routes.py) &gt;`@app.route("/whenever_route_you_want", methods=["GET"])` &gt; &gt;`def my_awesome_logic_implementation():` &gt; &gt;`pass`
I found this out a while ago...but I can't pass more than two values in html this way without showing those in url... I needed to use function so that i can pass parameter in it in flask...for example fun(a,b)...and in html....on click fun({(order.status}},{{order.key}});
Don't be discouraged by that!
Aw, so you need to pass some values into logic. You can do this via simple form with hidden fields + submit button to your preferred route. This will send POST request with all values from form in dict, so you can use them in python logic.
Please don't scrape IMDB. You don't need to. They literally make all of their data available to download, in bulk, for free. Even including a license that says you can use it for anything ["personal and non-commercial "](https://help.imdb.com/article/imdb/general-information/can-i-use-imdb-data-in-my-software/G5JTRESSHJBBHTGX). Here is a link to the dataset overview page: https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/ Here is a link to the dataset downloads: https://datasets.imdbws.com/
no, the entries of the columns are floats, the type of the column is Series
&gt; and no API used What do you mean by that?
Thank you for this article. I am a data scientist due to my previous employment (now retired). I wanted to build a machine learning python code to be used on a web server related to weather data. All the weather parameters from a personal weather station are saved into a MySQL database where I will probably use it to predict maximum or minimum temperature. I haven't started that process just yet because I will need to build the web pages first for Flask. I like the idea of using online machine learning which will fit my idea. I have written my ideas in the past on a piece of paper (this is how I build it) but I haven't it implemented in Python. The first article I read on machine learning was batch learning. In my case the data is accumulated one by one (streaming data). So I will see if I can use this method instead.
The link to the git repo in the notebook is broken.
I'm still under the free hours from the initial trial, but I don't expect this project alone to cost very much, if anything at all. The only users are our employees, so I set it up under the Standard Enviornment. It scales down to zero when not in use and doesn't actually start billing until more than one instance is needed. If this is only for you then I imagine it would stay free even after the trial.
Been using this method for two years, havent looked back. This community helped me better understand it too.
&gt;had to use it to get around Reddit's weird usage of that particular symbol Just use a backslash to escape it. #NoBackslash \#WithBackslash
Sorry, I fixed it!
It doesn't use the Genius or any other API at all to fetch the lyrics. That is why it's so fast.
What does it use then?
&gt;(I really wish I could write a paper on it haha, I researched naming conventions on Spotify and Genius to identify patterns so as to bridge them using nothing but string manipulations.) Forgive the paper writing part but basically that. The lyrics URL on Genius is formatted based on what we know about how Genius forms its links. That allows us to directly go the lyrics page in one go without having to search for the correct page first.
Thanks for all the info. &amp;#x200B; As others have pointed out, there's API's and libraries available that do what I did here, but in a much better manner. &amp;#x200B; This whole project was just an excused to learn HTML parsing, and I thought some other people would get a kick out of it. I'll look into what you've linked here if I decided to further experiment with all of this and see if I can't build up a different skill set by working with their data-sets.
How can i retrieve hidden field value in python?
I think I at least added something to the mix with the interactive search that I made for this, and a I learned a ton doing it. I had nothing to loose from sinking time into this, as it was all done for education, and it's done great for me in that aspect. Maybe I'll be able to work on a different skill set by following the suggestions of interfacing with an IMDB API, or find a way to contribute to the `imdbpy` repo. Either way this has all been a lot of fun, and I feel like I've learned a ton through all the responses here.
For example given the track is Hello by Adele, it will figure out the URL as https://genius.com/Adele-hello-lyrics. The tricky (and clever) part is for songs with complicated titles such as Seasons (with Sjava &amp; Reason) by Mozzy. Or even 거품 안 넘치게 따라줘 [Life Is Good] (feat. Crush, Dj Friz) by Dynamic Duo. You can view the function that handles this here https://github.com/SwagLyrics/SwagLyrics-For-Spotify/blob/b212634c4ff3598e83034b56e14664aed1cc8c2e/swaglyrics/cli.py#L22
Currently in the process of deploying a wireless home security camera system using Zero W's and Tensorflow's object detection API. Images from each Pi are sent over wifi to a central computer running object detection and backed up using a cloud service as well. Alerts are triggered when a person is detected within user-drawn boundary boxes around my property, as opposed to motion-based detection. The next step will be to integrate audible alarms when the system is armed.
Oh it's just the actual website + scraping. Pretty sure their ToS explicitly indicate that scraping their content isn't allowed unless you are scraping the content you submitted.
It isn't forbidden in their robots.txt for some reason.
Tnx man.. Just what u needed..
The best course is probably [Automate the Boring Stuff](https://www.udemy.com/automate/) by Al Sweigart. The course is good, but it's mainly a chapter by chapter coverage of his book which is available in its entirety [online here](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/). I highly recommend it, and once you're finished with the course you should be in a position to do a lot of really nifty things to spread your Python wings. The one warning I'd give is that Automate the Boring Stuff doesn't teach you about Classes. This is a deliberate choice, and a a good one, but it does leave one of the fundamental areas of Python uncovered. So after you complete this you should find a course to cover that ground. I'd probably recommend Codecademy's course on Python and just skipping to the end of it to do the Class based components.
Great suggestion. Added an "outline" to the intro.
One thing that continuously surprises me is that nobody wrote a bot to answer this kind of question.
Yeah, their ToS seems to prohibit, I seem to recall seeing a few plugins for music players I used do this and they eventually were asked to stop. &gt;Except as expressly authorized by Genius in writing, you agree not to modify, copy, frame, scrape, rent, lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative works based on the Service or the Genius Content, in whole or in part, except that the foregoing does not apply to your own User Content (as defined above) that you legally upload to the Service.

Thanks for the detailed reply! So you’re suggesting to start with this course before any of the “introductory” classes that have projects in the curriculum?
I’ll take that up as my (3rd?) project as I get started 😂
I see, I wonder how it applies to the repository itself since while it provides the tools to violate the ToS it doesn't do so itself. So I don't think they can remove it as a violation given those ToS.

Legally, super duper depends. Morally, no - they said don't scrape so don't scrape.
This has projects in its curriculum as well, and you'll learn how to do things like manipulate text files, spreadsheets, scrape the web and access web based APIs for data, and a ton more. It's a real hands-on and practical approach to learning the language and it's deeply rewarding.
Not sure how to address your iteration question (would need to see the code). But you can return multiple values from a function in Python: return x,y,z The function in this case returns a tuple of length 3, and you can assign 3 variables to the return value and Python unpacks it for you.
I signed up for the seven day trial on https://www.codecademy.com/ and so far I’m really liking it because it’s not just a bunch of boring lecture. You’re writing code constantly. There’s also a good python course on edX.org that is free but you have to wait for it to start since it’s not self paced. It also has a lot of coding homework and questions.
I didn't actually see the Genius ToS before but I was surprised when their robots/.txt didn't forbid it. I don't ever deal with the scraping part in the backend or at any central place. All of that is centred around getting the stripper to their user. I've seen people evade this sort of thing by getting the requests over Tor or setting up User-Agent or so to give the appearance of a normal User. Do you think it's a good idea to inform the user via a disclaimer or something?
Are you running a server with flask to serve the html file for browser tab lyrics? What's the point in this? Couldn't you just load a standard .html file with the style in a tag without the need for a server/localhost?
It uses flask since it's dynamic—the tab will update with lyrics when the song changes in Spotify automatically. If that could be done as easily without Flask then I'd love to update :)
Hey I had done this in a discord bot a while ago, fun stuff
Perfect, thank you again!
Thanks that more or less solves my problem, the iteration isn’t really a problem it was more of the multiple values thing. That’s great though thank you. :)
Great! My sister just recommended edX as well and another user recommended code academy above, so seems like I’ve got a starting plan. Thank you!
Is there a way to search google for an image? I d always wondered myself
I think monetization would at least be a factor for fair use: From [https://www.copyright.gov/fair-use/more-info.html](https://www.copyright.gov/fair-use/more-info.html): &gt;Courts look at how the party claiming fair use is using the copyrighted work, and are more likely to find that nonprofit educational and **noncommercial** uses are fair.

&gt;I don't ever deal with the scraping part in the backend or at any central place. Consider for a second that Google is currently being sued for allegedly providing lyrics gathered via scraping in search results. I don't think that matters (they don't say it is allowed as long as you aren't storing it somewhere - it explicitly says it isn't allowed, and things like "hiding via Tor so I can ignore their use policies" are sketchy band-aids used to completely ignore the site creator/maintainer at best. Basically, if a site says "do not scrape" then just don't scrape that site - pretty straight forward. It says with their written consent it is allowed, so probably best to inform the potential users that they need to do this if they intend to use your library for this. Otherwise you are just setting people up to potentially have their lyrics source ripped out from under them with potential legal action being taken (Google is currently being sued by Genius for alleged "lyrics scraping"). Think about it for a second though - you are explicitly ignoring the instructions a website gives you relative to their content. That just isn't being a respectful internet citizen. Robots.txt is only half of the equation, you need to check Terms of Service/Acceptable Use Policy before producing things that might violate them.

There is already a ready to use search-by-image extension for popular web browsers: https://github.com/dessant/search-by-image If you insist on an own Python program, you can use a Python and e.g. Selenium combination to access web sites automatically. You can learn from source above how to make the search term for the search tool of your choice from image URLs. If you have binary image data instead of URLs, there are reverse image search sites that allow upload of images to search for e.g. TinEye.
That's exactly what you can do with google images.
Don't even have to blacklist the bot - just remove the comment. That way TotesMessengerBot can still notify us of other crossposts (which is useful) without being spammed.

Bad bot
Essentially? I'm a novice so maybe I've been looking in the wrong area or just don't know what I'm talking about
&gt;WHY Obviously because it's (also) installed in a different location. (don't have a mac handy anymore so can't say where). Try \`\`which python3\`\`. Make sure you're not removing a system installed python or you may hose your os.
That actually might be the easiest way, are there any guides to help after I set python up? I just installed Python3

Ive had a blast. Material could be done in 2 days. But im not a complete beginner so idk. Discord server is pretty active so i doubt he’ll have any problems.
I agree with what you're saying, I've actually researched into it quite a bit. Google actually didn't scrape the lyrics themselves, they license from a private company called LyricFind (the same company who handles this for Shazam and Deezer too) who're accused of scraping lyrics from Genius. &amp;#x200B; While I'm not guilty of that, I realise that enabling others to be legally wrong is morally wrong in itself and I think I was more excited by inventing the faster approach and covering my own ass (I made this just for myself initially) that I didn't think that others are using it too. &amp;#x200B; \&gt; It says with their written consent it is allowed, so probably best to inform the potential users that they need to do this if they intend to use your library for this. &amp;#x200B; I'll do this I think, if someone does get permission or maybe wants to try it out for their own songs then they shouldn't be forbidden. &amp;#x200B; Thanks for letting me know about this, didn't really feel that something as tiny as this would ever make a difference but it doesn't hurt to be future proof!
You cannot control mintty that way. Write you control app exactly like you would in Linux. Popen the app and write to a pipe attached to it's stdin and read from a pipe attached to it's stdout. As long as the program under control is also a cygwin console program (or a ported Linux console program) this should work just like under Linux. If the app is a windows console or any kind of Gui program, YMMV.
Sounds like you want to write a scraper. A great module to look into would be bs4 (BeautifulSoup)
When I saw “lyrics” and “faster” I assumed that it had to be tested with [twista](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=zSYDbpOuYUE) .
Yeah, I highly doubt any of it makes any difference to anyone. I just refuse to ignore ToS with respect to scraping and such, there is almost always a good source *somewhere* without violating anything. Kind of a "good netizen" thing when it comes to programming. Thanks for listening! You are the first person I've brought this up to that didn't immediately argue that "I can do what I want, the data is right there", but rather discussed what it meant and responded in (what seems to me anyways) a very reasonable response. Good luck!
ive been doing something manually made, and more for videos. &amp;#x200B; Im super cheap and youtube has just as good content, if not better sometimes than cable tv. at least for me. &amp;#x200B; im in the process of building "channels" which are really just playlists and playing them in random order. This way i dont get stuck with the copyright issues. besides im just making them for myself. &amp;#x200B; what this inspires me to do however is to make something in python that scrubs youtube and things with certain tags will get automatically placed in certain playlists so im not just putting content in there ive already seen. &amp;#x200B; right now ive got a few playlists. but im doing this because we all know what the "recommended" sidebar on auto play gets us to. lol
Try $ which python It will show you where it’s coming from
Congrats! Why did you put your container 290% height? It's causing really long white space between container and footer.

TBH it's because I could not figure out how to properly place the footer when I don't know the height of the contents of the page. For the main page, the d3 script runs in one of the Flask templates as the page is generated, so when I set the footers location the graph it generates can run beyond the page height and the footer kind of just sits in the middle of the visualization. Similar issues were presented on the /donate page where I don't know how tall the payment processors iframe is going to be on a device. I am admittedly NOT a front end person, so all of the UI stuff was a huge challenge for me and the footer was one thing I could not really figure out. If this project picks up any steam, I will definitely be putting more time into it and fixing the footer is number one of my list of things I need to figure out how to do.
 &gt;you won't be monetizing anything on this You have no idea
Use code Acadamy. It's brilliant. You don't have to go through all of the installation, setup frustration, just jump in and learn. Meanwhile, you can set up your computer to run python. Also, start using an online python IDE if you do not have python installed in your computer yet. There is absolutely no reason to postpone learning. I am saying this because, for me, the most difficult part was installing and configuring my system. &amp;#x200B; The biggest issue that I had with python is setting it up in windows. anaconda distribution at the time. Use that. it will make things 100 times easier. There are going to be people who advocate a simple way of doing it using a text editor and command line. This is good if you have an instructor to help you with stuff. Otherwise, you need a distribution. The good thing about Jupiter notebook that comes with anaconda is it's possible to see "feedback" immediately. This would be great for learning. Later you can start using something like Jetbrains pycharm. &amp;#x200B; It does not matter what language you start with. You have to use a few of them to do anything useful. Since all of them are same for some extent, learning the second language is not that difficult. I learned python within about 2 months because I knew visual basic and Java a little bit. Recently I had to use C# and "learnt" it in about 2 days. When I say learnt, that is not to get an A in a class. Just enough to make the application that I was doing.
Beautiful, thank you this is exactly what I was looking for, working nicely with my docker setup.
Yeah, ok....Last I checked copyright theft is still a bannable on youtube. As well as trying to make money of copyrighted material. So yeah....
You're in for a treat when you will discover Flexbox :)
There are many pitfalls but one could be that you have problems with companies claiming they now own the copyright, someone uses the software where you claim it "works" and it doesn't and there are damages. That is a few of many reasons why e.g. MIT licenses etc say that the software is "provided as is" and the like. If you want to allow people to use it and modify it as they please and dont care about much else go with MIT.
It's really worth learning Flexbox, because it easily solves all those kind of problems and more. https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox.asp
I know how copyright works. Especially on youtube. I was just saying you have no idea people are making hundreds of dollars per day using these kinds of methods.

Thanks! Well I realise that it doesn't make it okay just because someone isn't looking and given that it has accrued more than 43k downloads I do have a moral obligation here. And I mean yeah it is probably the most efficient and clinical approach out there (do you think I can actually author a paper? 😛) and it also does something the guys at Genius didn't think of (the robots.txt forbids \`Disallow: /api$, Disallow: /api/\*\` the API as well as \`Disallow: /search?\*\` querying the search endpoint) which kind of spurred me on (knowledge for the sake of knowledge). As well as, it is really annoying to search for lyrics when using Spotify :P &gt; I just refuse to ignore ToS with respect to scraping and such, there is almost always a good source *somewhere* without violating anything. Kind of a "good netizen" thing when it comes to programming. There isn't a good legal source here but that shouldn't stop me from being a good netizen anyway. I'll get back to drafting the message :D Thanks again!
You may have a problem with using a song name containing unusual characters. I found a song your script uploaded called Seorita (pretty sure it’s Señorita). Anyway, cool project!
As a note, both your operations could be reduced to something like: `if choice == 1:` `character_array = [` `character` `for character in sentence` `if character.lower() not in vowels` `]` `sentence = "".join(character_array)` etc Even that can be made neater. Also consider following PEP8 for for style ([https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)), it makes most things more clear and nicer to read
Thanks! Heard good things about poetry, decided to just use pip-tools because it seemed slightly more straightforward to tack onto an existing project, but if I find shortcomings poetry will def be my next stop!

Hell yeah, that's what it's all about! There is no better way to learn than working on an idea that is interesting to you. If you ever want to chat about ideas or anything, I'm always down!
&gt; I didn't actually see the Genius ToS before but I was surprised when their robots/.txt didn't forbid it. That is not what robots.txt is primarily for (despite what tutorials for web scraping say online). For the most part, robots.txt is optimized for web crawlers for search engine indexing, caching, and archiving. Just because a website forbids a web crawler from indexing some page doesn't mean they mind if that page is scraped. And vice-versa is true, too. It's inherently unreliable to use as a guide for scraping, especially since most sites care *far* more what Google indexes on them with a standard they know Google uses, as opposed to what some software engineers might look at, so they are going to optimize robots.txt for that purpose.
&gt; nice demonstration of quick/dirty/~~effective~~ work. FTFY, this is actually more work that using autotools and doesn't do NEARLY as much. So, I can't agree with effective.
But why? No other functions work like that, it would need to be a special case. And the entire point of this change was to remove the special-casing around `print`.
1. **Consider a simpler problem** You need to create a list of integers from 1 to n. Here's a simple iterative way: def get_numbers(N): numbers = [] for x in range(1, N): numbers.append(x) return numbers Can you convert this into a recursive function? Hint: Consider an additional parameter: `current_number` **Incomplete code for you to fill in:** def get_numbers(N, current_number): if base-case: return something # recursive case numbers = get_numbers(..., ...) # do something with current_number and modify the numbers list return numbers 2. Once you solve that simpler problem, see if the solution helps you will your original problem.

Im making a notetaking desktop app in Python for a school club. I started off using Pygame and coding everything from scratch, including the text input, but soon realized how absolutely atrocious that might turn out later when I try to add extra features. I’m now trying to learn about kivy and transition to that because i’ve heard good things about it. (note, by school I mean high school, also im pretty bad at coding still, but I have a passion for it, so it’s pretty fun :) )
I mean it took less than five minutes and saves me from Ctrl+R gcc or a bunch of ↑ to find my last gcc and I can finish my project instead of taking time out to learn a build tool.
I see, I didn't know that. Thank you!
Sure, there are libraries to create python bindings for existing C++ code, such that you can call C++ code from Python. [pybind11](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11) and [boost.python](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_58_0/libs/python/doc/) are among the possible options.

Wow this post comes at a great time -- but first and foremost, incredible work. This looks like a really nice piece of software. A lot of hard work has obviously gone into this. &amp;#x200B; I've been dabbling with the Spotify/Genius API over the last few days (Though certainly nothing to this degree...). I've gotten it to a point where the program grabs what song is currently playing, uses that to search the Genius API, and prints out the song. The thing I'm stumped on though is I can't for the life of me find a website, API or otherwise, which has timestamps attached to the lyric files and can automatically download the files. I'm looking specifically for `*.lrc` files. This would be used to display the lyrics line by line, as they occur in the song. I feel like it would make for a more interactive experience. I've seen ways to manually download the files one by one or in phone apps, but ideally this would all be automated for obvious reasons. &amp;#x200B; Do you know of any place that has something like that? Or is this a case where webscraping would be necessary?
Added a USING.txt that would ship with every copy of the package :)
can you not use the text box thing I used?
There is tons of bot generated content on Youtube and i hate it so much. I have to deal with it when I'm trying to search up topics like motorcycle reviews. It's a cool idea and a neat programming challenge, but what you're doing is making youtube and the internet a worse place.
 myfunction(*mylist) The asterisk unpacks the list of objects and passes each one as an argument.
That works! I've been struggling with this for the past hour, thank you so much!
The same syntax is used to declare such functions: def variable_num_args_fxn(*args): # args is a list containing all arguments for arg in args: print(arg) variable_num_args_fxn(1, 2, 3) # Output: # 1 # 2 # 3 There is a similar syntax for variable keyword arguments, using instead 2 asterisks: def variable_num_kwargs_fxn(**kwargs): # kwargs is a dict containing each parameter-value pair pass
Glad to help! I personally love this feature, and in fact, I probably abuse it a bit more than I should haha.
yes, you can use ctypes to call C++ and Fortran functions from external DLLs (if you're on windows, or their equivalents on linux/osx). https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1942298/wrapping-a-c-library-in-python-c-cython-or-ctypes I've also used cython in the past, but ctypes seems to be more mature. If you're coming to python from C++ it'll will be significantly easier to get your head around than if you're a python programmer trying to learn C++. You can also call OpenCV directly from python, so that might be enough for you https://opencv-python-tutroals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/py_tutorials/py_tutorials.html
Thanks! I've spent the past few months researching and refining the approaches used so I appreciate it :) Your comment comes at a very interesting time as well, since that is exactly what we're working on right now. I'm actually mentoring a Google Summer of Code project to automate synchronization of lyrics given the audio file and the lyrics text. This was one of the intended aims when I started the project last year now we're working on it finally, I don't think this has been done so far. You can view that at [https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5694893526089728](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5694893526089728) Musixmatch does this manually and it depends on their users for doing so (which leads to inconsistencies), however I believe the highest tier of their API does allow you access to those. There's also LyricFind, a private company which is behind the synced lyrics support at Deezer. There are also a ton of Mandarin websites that allow you to do this [https://github.com/ddddxxx/LyricsX#lyrics-sources](https://github.com/ddddxxx/LyricsX#lyrics-sources) You might also find sites that can provide .lrc files but none of those have support for newer and popular music.

Thanks. The boost library looks very interesting

This is a common case in functional programming where you take everything from a list and return one value. This is called a "fold" or a "reduce". What you do is pass a empty result list and the target list. Each loop you break your list into a head (first element of the list) and a tail (rest of the list). If the head matches add it to the result list and recuse with the result list and the tail. When the target list is empty that is your base case This pattern is so common it has a function in the functools module called [reduce](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#functools.reduce). Look at this for a example. It used to be a built in function but it was removed because guido does not like functional programming
Salute, great work! Starting from zero and putting this together require some effort. I will make a web project soon using more or less the same technologies. Why did you choose Flask as opposed to Django?
Wouldn't any song beginning with "Couldn't get lyrics for" an issue?
Did you give it a try? If so, what does that code look like?
I have a knack for programming, and I've just started on the basics of python, so I'm pretty much a newbie here! 😅

Typically yes, however such a song doesn't exist (yet) and the test is run on Spotify's US Top 50 chart which didn't contain such a track hence it wasn't a problem to use it here.
In my research, Flask came across as a simpler, less featured option which I figured meant a more approachable learning curve. This was an incredible resource for me: https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world
For your purposes, you could have gotten away with about the same amount of time and had a working Makefile - compiling a single folder of source with some options is *really* easy. Probably worth learning a build tool sooner than later if you are going to be spending much time in C/C++.

But for python basics, I'd suggest "Automate The Boring Stuff" just to get you on the terminology and syntax. There is also the "Arcpy Cookbook. You might find an advantage or an efficient learning method within the context of GIS/spatial data. &amp;#x200B; I myself learned python through GIS, the advantage is being able to visualize what you are coding on a map. &amp;#x200B; There are lots of resources on gis.stacksoverflow and plenty of examples. &amp;#x200B; Start small and manipulate your spatial data using for loops and the cursors and you can develop some script tools. &amp;#x200B; Source: Just somebody that used this method to learn python.
having the same issues
hello! u/Omar_88 Welcome to the XYZ sub!
Ah,I've not had a use case for dask so it totally slipped my mind, let me give it a go ! Thanks buddy

Cython is your best choice long-term. Higher learning curve but it's the best choice for performance and flexibility. You can call C or C++ code from Python, and even call Python code from your C or C++ code. And it makes your Python code run almost as fast as C (~40x faster than vanilla Python in some cases), which other methods won't do. ctypes might be better if you just want to get started today and don't care about performance or flexibility. It's a good first step.
cool project, it's a fun idea to implement some algorithms to get at better understanding. However i'm most interested in applying deep learning for stuff and for that i'm just to damn lazy to implement everything from scratch :p have you ever tried something like Tensorflow or PyTorch? Personally i use PyTorch for my projects :)
I wouldn’t release the code
It helped thanks!
Done, I didnt see the textbox/codeblock option. Anyway, the point I was trying to make is that some things can be done in a way which is basically just pure english
Yeah, I do use TF, know basic tf and keras, actually I built an image classifier(AlexNet on tf, and mobilenetv2 on keras([https://github.com/mishazakharov/ImageClassificator](https://github.com/mishazakharov/ImageClassificator))). But I have never used pytorch yet. Is it that good ?
It's not like the interpreter is going to check into the central command server and just not run anymore.
I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit: - [/r/pythonlanguage] [My enterprise tech company in the bay area still has alot of their codebase in python2.7 what happens come 5 months later when it supposed becomes unsupported? Will it be Y2K20?](https://www.reddit.com/r/PythonLanguage/comments/cdniw6/my_enterprise_tech_company_in_the_bay_area_still/) &amp;nbsp;*^(If you follow any of the above links, please respect the rules of reddit and don't vote in the other threads.) ^\([Info](/r/TotesMessenger) ^/ ^[Contact](/message/compose?to=/r/TotesMessenger))*
Better than those companies that are entirely on Python 2.7. We started switching on 2 of our projects about 3 months ago. We have plenty of legacy code and new projects with no python version requirement that are continuing to be developed under python 2 despite some of them having requirement to support python 2. What happens is you stop getting bug fixes and new features.
Post the code or we really can't help you... Sounds like you need to head over to /r/learnpython and get better before you tackle the problem.
There's plenty of channels taking advantage of small indie source music such as all the chill channels. They ride small guys until they get large enough then the small music producers can't resist letting them have it and promote their music. It's kinda fucked up. I followed youtube user @ambition from 10k to 1Million. He basically just stole a bunch of soundcloud indie chill music, monetized and took donations. Then now that he's got a large enough follower base, he can basically legally get away with it since people ask him to promote their music now.
I'm not trying to avoid build tools. I was in the middle of decent progress and got sidetracked by reading Make docs and examples and wanted to get back to my work. Maybe I should have made it more clear this was more of a hacky script to run gcc with different args more easily.
&gt; It's kinda fucked up. Nah, that's fully fucked up. My other life is as a musician, but that doesn't pay the bills so that's why I learned to code. Now on the otherside of things, it is disgusting to see someone have the thought process: *"I'm going to take something someone spent weeks on, do some minor tweaks, and now I get to monetize that."*
What industry, what use case? Are you shipping software for clients to consume, or do you manage backends and etl processes?
Let me add 3. Don't post screenshoots of code. Put actually Code instead.
GI Steve? I'm so sorry.
Well since you're in the bay area it will be exactly like y2k and your code will stop working. Why did you include that completely irrelevant tidbit in your title?
Checkout the app sololearn. It has all kinds of programming stuff in it. I did use it alot and still do sometimes.
Ya I looked this up while writing to be sure I wasn't speaking nonsense, and all I mostly came across were blogs by newbies showing how to web scrape and all of them suggesting to look at robots.txt. While it's not necessarily harmful I don't think this teaches the right process, which is to read TOS. :)
Or is it...?
They should be the cream of the crop, and with that context they still suffer from huge technical debt.
Bunch of internal tools
This looks great and the idea is awesome. Great work!
Any reason you're not using numpy for all mathematical functions? Great project !
Asking so I know more, if someone violates the robots.txt, is that not illegal so to speak or is it a case of should versus must?
- if the PNG file format is so simple , i wonder why the Wikipedia page for it contains NO examples https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Network_Graphics - while the page for BMP contains 2 real ( and complete ) examples https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMP_file_format#Example_1 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMP_file_format#Example_2
Any python program runs through the python interpreter. You just have to call it through the command line... it’s pretty easy to figure it out with google :)
Go check the source code!
Thanks for the downvote
Very impressive! As a self taught beginner myself this is pretty inspiring. I'm hoping to dig into flask very soon to start building some of my own ideas into web apps. Keep up the good work!
On top of what others have mentioned, there's the actual cpython API you can use directly, including &lt;Python.h&gt; and creating python functions in c++ that act as your API into your c++ code, those in c++ too. Then you can literally do this from python if you have a mylib.so: import mylib mylib.some_function(...) You just write an interface in c++ that uses the cpython api to translate python args to whatever your code takes.
Only if someone finds a security bug in 2.7 that allows full access to the underlying OS if you used the sys module. And even then python would have to refuse to patch that. &amp;#x200B; Unlike y2k where everything did change at a specific date, with this everything will not change at a specific date but build practices will just push python3 and interns will have fun tasks like churning python2 into python3 because "that's something they could do", so things like that will change.
Um, try this series I just found. Its by Peter Farrel. peter farrell python books. The illustrated ones are the best. if you live near a bookstore, you can find it there.
It won't be the end of the world but you should have started yesterday on figuring out a roadmap to convert all that code to Python 3.x. Fortunately, that's a problem other companies (like Dropbox, Facebook, and others) have faced before and have documented for everyone to see. For example, check the following article Dropbox made available at the end of the last year: [https://blogs.dropbox.com/tech/2018/09/how-we-rolled-out-one-of-the-largest-python-3-migrations-ever/](https://blogs.dropbox.com/tech/2018/09/how-we-rolled-out-one-of-the-largest-python-3-migrations-ever/)
Yet another vote for PyCharm, both the professional and community edition. It has served me very well in the past 4 years.
As an actual response based primarily on the fact that I work on legacy .NET apps... Nothing initially. Basically what this means, is that there will be no future updates to Python2.7. No bug fixes. No security updates. No new features. It will still be possible to install Python 2.7 wherever you need it, although that may be less true years down the road. Some of your favorite packages that currently support Python 2.7 might continue to provide support for their packages, but you'll have to check with them individually. Some popular packages have announced that they are dropping support for Python 2.7, but it'll still be possible to get frozen versions of those packages that support Python 2.7. Again, that means no new features and no new bug fixes for those packages while you're targeting 2.7. So yeah, maybe [start looking into what it would take to upgrade those apps to Python 3](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/pyporting.html), but you might have years until you have to actually do anything. Maybe plan for a future where getting and installing Python 2.7 is more difficult, but it might just be easier to see if the apps can be converted.
You sweet summer child. How new are you to programming? Enterprise is the worst when it comes to running outdated tech, that's why the old timers command such a large salary.
The reason why you couldn't find anyone else doing your clinical approach probably isn't because no one else thought about it... it's more likely because they read the TOS first and knew that they would be shut down and would have wasted their time.
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRvTeK5Ndq8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRvTeK5Ndq8) should get you up to speed. Other than that, think of interesting question you want to answer or data you can plot on maps.
As said by others, package management and distributing Python applications as executables. Unfortunately for me, I had to deal with both of these at the same time in a previous job I had.
I'm sorry but I disagree, there are way more popular tools that exist which are exactly like this or worse in the sense they do this for multiple websites and/or don't even respect robots.txt/ToS. For example, https://github.com/johnwmillr/LyricsGenius, https://github.com/scf4/lyricist, https://github.com/fr31/spotifylyrics, Those packages are themselves used by other packages so while I'm not saying I'm correct, I'm definitely not here because other people didn't try.
Don't go for anything lower than 3.6.
\&gt; Follow along in a GPU-enabled workbook! I wish more project would do this. Very interesting. I cant give you any comments on the engineering part, as its too far from my area of expertise. In any case, great post.

I'm not passing judgment. I've scraped my fair share of websites and broken a number of terms. But I admit what I'm doing and understand the risks involved. I've also used quite a few lyric apps and currently have the last one installed. Some have definitely been shut down or gone by the wayside, because I keep having to switch apps.
If you want a GUI, you will need to write one (there are a few libraries which help you create them). At the moment, you are interacting with your program through the command line, which is the only input/output it has access to unless you write more capability onto it.
Mac or PC?
Aren't there like websites where you paste py2 code and it is translated to py3 code? Just asking
What is your current ability? Not necessarily with just python but programming in general.
I am quite new and an intern yes.. isn't Google considered enterprise scale by now?
it drives me crazy that they're actively developing in python 2.7 and having me to maintain it as well. like why?!
the repo I'm working with is 100% python 2 and is still seeing active development. :(
No roadmap here afaik :(

A service for summarizing discussion forums (like Reddit). It's currently a personal project, but who knows if it will become something serious in the future.
Haha, that's rich. If they're having you maintain it, "maintain it" into Python 3.7 with backwards compatible support to Python 2.7 until it becomes "impossible 😉" to support 2.7.
I've been using this as a programming notebook, but it also has many other uses.
From python side you can have a look at libraries to process data (fiona, shapely) or visualize (cartopy) GIS data. From GIS side it would be good to start python in QGIS.
incredible!!
Could be worse. I might be switching to IronPython. It hasn't been supported by Microsoft since ~2011. They had a release where numpy just stopped working and nobody found out until the next major release. There isn't even a plan for Python 3.
Of course, but Google probably also has a bunch of tools knocking about that were written in the early 2000s and have never been updated, like most large companies will have. I'm sure their newer software makes use of the latest and greatest, but at a certain point it becomes cost prohibitive for a company to update everything they've written in the last 20+ years.
I'd say this belongs on r/learnpython but even there, nobody is going to do your homework for you. Before posting there, at least try something.

Well I really hope it doesn't come to that here because I really like this one, is simple, fast and gets the job done. Where I am, we don't have good internet speeds, so cycling through multiple providers or even searching wasn't an option for me in conjunction with playing the song. It took &gt;10s so I had to think of something, you said the others didn't think of it, that's actually true since they didn't really have the need to come up with something better. I just added the top one (LyricsGenius) to the mix to see how mine compares to that one, results are interesting. SwagLyrics is twice as fast on an average and more accurate (by only 1/50 cases though which was Sunflower by Post Malone). I'm running it on Colab so the difference averages out to seconds per track but relatively I'm happy with it :) I hope you try out SwagLyrics haha, I'd really appreciate tips on improvement/critique.
PC
I think a GUI is what I'm thinking of, I just think of it like, if I'm doing HTML for example, I get to physically see the results of the "code" I'm writing, but for Python I don't feel like I'm actually writing code that's able to really do anything, or like I just don't really understand how to use it outside of PyCharm
Definitely something we can all agree on. PyCharm is the best, literally.
How can it be 100% python 2? Python 2 and 3 are like 99% the same. :P Just going forward write stuff that is compatiable with both and when you start touching code that is py2-only fix it to work with py3 as well.
&gt;Anyone heard of Delphi Object Pascal? &amp;#x200B; Delphi refugee here. &amp;#x200B; &gt; Its your geanddads coding platform from 20 years ago and allows aingle exe file on Winsows, mac ,ios Android and Linux. &amp;#x200B; As does any other statically compiled language. &amp;#x200B; &gt; The GUI design is better than any including C# &amp;#x200B; The GUI design tool isn't anything better than Visual Basic 6 or QT Creator. Drop components onto a form - how is that any different than any other visual design tool today? &amp;#x200B; &gt; The vendor Embarcadero charges $5000 for it &amp;#x200B; Delphi Pro SKU is $1500. That said, adding all of the closed-source third party libraries you may need to build an application can drive the cost up substantially. Heck, just the Delphi (inferior) equivalent of Numpy, SciPy, Matplotlib will run you $1600 from Dew Research. &amp;#x200B; &gt;but to be cross platform from a single code base its probably worth it for comercial projects. &amp;#x200B; C++/Qt, Java, C#, etc. can all give you mainstream cross-platform for less money. Delphi still hasn't shipped a compiler for 64 bit OS X (!!!) and if it doesn't have a 64 bit Android compiler by August Delphi users won't be able to update their apps in the Google Play store (!!!). The minimal resources being devoted to it by the current owners makes these kinds of incidents common. Dealing with Embarcadero isn't worth it for commercial projects. In the latest dust-up, the company tried to make it so that if you weren't paying their yearly support fee they wouldn't reset their archaic installation limit DRM. This meant that people with old copies of Delphi were being told they simply wouldn't be allowed to reinstall their product / install it on a new PC, making their software investment worthless. This seems to have been settled now after a revolt in the community, but it seems at the least they're still rerouting installation bump requests from out-of-subscription customers to the sales department first to receive a sales pitch (!!). Sigh. &amp;#x200B; &gt; There is a free community veraion dor non commercial projects (no network TCP) or an open sorce clone FPC/Lazarus. I'm not sure what you mean by no network TCP; the community version is the same as the Professional SKU. You can use it for commercial projects but not if you earn more than $5,000. Compare this to Visual Studio's free version, where the limit is owning 200 PCs or making $1 million dollars.
Yes, there's even a python library and script to do it (`2to3`). But it can't catch everything.
Nothing will happen because no one will update anything.
It's not that big a difference
i can do it for free, but: \- it's more like self education. i'll give you resources to explore - you'll ask me to help if needed. \- i'm esl, so don't pretend to perfect language ability i have several requirements: \- we are using linux as main system \- i'm not answering questions related to python in windows or windows specific \- telegram or discord only. feel free to ask.
Anytime. :)
Any methods you use to generate interesting or potentially profitable ideas?
If python is installed... Start menu. Type cmd. It’ll open the command line. You then need to navigate to your python folder. It’s likely right under C:, but sometimes it’s under user. Try ‘cd python’ and hit tab to see if resolve anything. If it does hit enter to go to the folder. In the python folder, if you type python, it should go to the IDLE (you can code right in the command line) You’ll have to save your .py scripts in that folder, and you can type python or python3 and then the filename.py to run your stuff.
This is for a hw and the rules are: 1. It has to be done recursively 2. No loops 3. No global var
Front end vs backend. Python is a backend language
This is cool. Approximately how many hours did it take you to crank through this?
Sorta.. you can make a single binary but its not going to be super portable, which is like the point of using pyinstaller. Gotta try to build binary on oldest system you can and hope for the best... and making a staticly linked binaries are incredibley annoying... basically gave up trying to get hashlib to work.
Python bindings have limited capability compared to the native C
&gt;Some popular packages have announced that they are dropping support for Python 2.7, but it'll still be possible to get frozen versions of those packages that support Python 2.7. Old versions means that many of the support channels for projects (IRC, mailing lists, forums, Stack Overflow, etc.) will start rejecting questions. No one wants to answer questions about a quirk or bug that was fixed long ago.
There certainly will be consultancies that will back port any serious security fixes from 3 to 2.7. Libraries are another story.
88.25 as of today :)
What's your error?
First, you forgot to aasign the return value of `CALCULATOR()` to a variable before checking it. Second, you forgot to convert each number input from string to integer inside the for loop.
Not really, and this idea came from a friend of mine who was looking for a technical collaborator. I think the best ideas come from getting deep into something _non_ technical. Once you're really engaged in some other area of the world your brain will start connecting dots for how to bring technology into it. That's how I came up with another project, www.takecareofmyplant.com
And how would I do that, I’m new to python... sorry
Thanks! I hope people have some fun with it and we can raise some real meaningful money for the primaries!
You need to post an error for people to help you. Also, you should include the actual code instead of your screen taken with your phone
Oh sorry.
`operation_choice == 'A' or operation_choice == 'a'`
Error is “iter must be a iterable on line 30
It’s not that
How would I do that... sorry
Weird some one already solved my issue. Maybe you just lack competency :/
It’s not _only_ that.
&gt;And even then python would have to refuse to patch that. And when they do patch it, there will be the inevitable outcry of "they're enabling people to not upgrade"
Nice work. Admire the grit!
Yea
If you want a full-fledged UI with clickable stuff, you need to learn a GUI package like Tkinter or PyQt.
Wow. Nightcore is garbage.

Error code “int()argument must be a string or a number, not ‘lidt’on line 30
First I'd like to address a bug I see in the code: ``` if operation_choice == "S" or "s": ``` will always evaluate to `True`, you might want to write something like: ``` if operation_choice in ("S", "s"): # Or if operation_choice.lower() == "s": ``` To answer your question, you can do something like: ``` for _ in range(x): op = input("Enter an operation:") operations.append(op) # Later ... result = numbers.pop() for op in operations: next_num = numbers.pop() # Perform the operation ``` [Heres a gist of how I'd do a similar calculator (but with infinite inputs)](https://gist.github.com/snorrwe/c0cf79f255ed62bf27e0d8e3ee481036)

You need to convert n to an int. You are converting the sum to int but not n.
How do I do that
Thank you but what do I replace this code for

Well I was trying to decide between learning HTML/CSS/JS or Python, a lot of people sseem to recommend Python because it's such a versatile language but maybe I'll just work on the others for now since I do have experience with that, thank you
1) You should be posting questions about help in r/learnpython or r/learnprogramming 2) This is incorrect: if operation_choice=="A" or "a": It should read: if operation_choice=="A" or operation_choice=="a": 3) When you run "CALCULATOR()" you are never assigning the value that the function returns to any variable, therefore the function is returning the result to nowhere. What you should do instead is either assign a variable to whatever the function returns OR you can call the function inside the if statement. Example: if CALCULATOR() == "A": #do stuff Also, if you want to make this piece of code more efficient, add ".lower()" to the end of the input command and it will turn any letter (capital or lower case) and turn it into a lower case character. This way you don't have to add code to "guess" what the user will input. For example: user_input = input('Please enter your choice').lower() 4) Please read the reddit sidebars and post accordingly. It's a lot cleaner and easier for people to help you if you actually post the code, and not just a picture of it. Also when you post code, make you follow reddit code formatting rules. This way people will be more likely to help you and it'll be easier for people to do so.
Just as a side note, any program that runs with a GUI can 99% of the time perform the same function through the terminal (the thing at the bottom of Pycharm). There are many Python libraries for building GUIs, check out [https://opensource.com/resources/python/gui-frameworks](https://opensource.com/resources/python/gui-frameworks) . But most people start by writing a program for the command line and then creating a GUI to interact with. If you're a bit more experienced you'll probably just create the GUI right off the bat, but it sounds to me like you need some fundamentals first. Practice writing programs that can do things regardless of the user interface, then build a user interface to make it easier to interact with.
Yes I think this is what I'm not quite getting, I heard that Python can do front end too but I guess it's not quite the same as using javascript or something, thank you for you input
Sorry about that and thank you!
I meant for that to be used after line 37, \`CALCULATOR()\` in your code Also I left the code to actually perform the operation for you to write. The gist I linked is simply for reference, if you're curious how I'd do the whole thing, feel free to ignore it.
This gave me an error
Been learning Python via Automate the Boring Stuff and recently via his free Udemy course. Got decent way through and decided last week to try Python Crash Course. I seem to be grasping and doing the “try it yourself” without any issues so far. I loved AtBS but it didn’t seem to work with my learning style.
Make line 30 exactly: ``` print int(sum(numbers)) ``` Should work, or give a different error. `sum()` returns a number.
`numbers.append(int(n))`
I might have misunderstood the question, do you want to perform the same operation for every number? Like if the input is \`S\` you'll do something like \`1-2-3-4-5-6\` ? In that case you can do something like: \`\`\` result = numbers\[0\] # Initialize result for num in numbers\[1:\]: # Iterate over the numbers, skipping the first element if operation\_choice.lower() == "s": result = result - num elif operation\_choice.lower() == "a": result = result + num \# Etc. \# result is the final value print(result) \`\`\`
Actually, it is that. Not only is it that, but it's a lot of other stuff too.
Dum dum dum!
Sorry, there was a bug in the code, also it's incomplete, I was presuming that you want to make this as an exercise so I left actually performing the operations to you
Ik I may not learn but I really want to figure this out I’ve been working on this for 3+ hours. What I want to do is create a calculator that asks the user how many numbers he wants. When that is inputted they are given the prompt to enter numbers the number of times they had originally chosen. Next they can chose to Add, subtract , multiply or divide, they can only chose one of those 4 options
Can they choose an operation for each pair of numbers? Can they do something like \`1 + 4 - 3 \* 5\` or they only choose one operation to apply to each number like \`1 + 4 + 3 + 5\` ?
Look here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3819449/how-to-uninstall-python-2-7-on-a-mac-os-x-10-6-4 It explains it for 2.7 but ut’s the same for your version, just change the numbers. Do *not* blindly delete stuff coming up with `which python`, you need the default python (2) to stick around.
I'll see that, I need to figure out how to properly use a debugger though, I think I can get by but nothing special.
One operation to all, but from the menu they have to chose (A, S,M,D) add, subtract, multiply, divide
No. Python 2.7 will keep working just fine. However, it won't get any bug fixes or security updates any more. 3rd party packages's authors will eventually stop providing new packages for old Py 2.7. There won't be a suddent "end of the world" - that's good. But it doesn't mean you shouldn't be working on getting critical code Py 3 compatible.
I think boost is better if you're using C++. Speed isn't that much of an issue if you're using Python, and boost should be almost as fast anyway.
Well it wasn’t you...
I edited an earlier reply [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/cdp7t5/so_im_trying_to_make_a_calculator_from_scratch/etvl2s5?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) If you stick it to the end, from line 37 it should work
It is absolutely not illegal in any jurisdiction, it is a completely open standard that anyone may or may not adhere to.
Plenty of Python programs use HTML/CSS/JS for their user interface. But there's also plenty of programs with a GUI that are available to run on your computer. One that I use nearly every day for managing ebooks is called Calibre. &amp;#x200B; [Here's a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsNhTFfoHKk) of that program in action. I'm not really saying anything about the content of that video, just that you can see what you can do with python.
I'm tempted to say you have a typo on line 4, character 13.
Can you make an option for "Anyone but Trump" and I will donate a dollar?
This works but it combines the numbers for example if I try to add 1, 2, and 3 it print out 123 and the rest of the operations don’t work
Right, it's a bug in your code On line 32 insert: `n = float(n) # convert the input to a floating point number`
This really should be said more, I wish there were HOWTOs and tutorials that actually mentioned scraping responsibly vs. just scraping.
Hard to tell without seeing your code, but assuming you're using sympy, it would probably look something like: from sympy import x, y, z, diff f = x**3 + 2*x + 3 df = diff(f, x) print("df =", df.subs(x, 4)
Do you have any social media I can contact you with, so I can send you pictures of the code and due to the wait time I have to wait due to reddit saying “you’ve been doing this too much wait 10 minutes “. Gave me error “list index out of range on line” the code on this line is result = numbers [0]
Haha, actually yes. The page loads on the Dem Primary contest because it's the most relevant right now, but you can go to the Rep primary and support Bill Weld who is attempting to primary Trump. And then, of course, the General Election, you can support any of the parties right now. Once candidates are locked in, we'll flip those place holders over to their respective candidates.
Wondering if people have a similar opinion as me, but I really dislike putting external calls in \_\_init\_\_. In this case, I'd probably do some type of factory method to create/return an instance of the class. Do others agree? Anyhow, good job coding something!
Its character 11 idiot
It's 3:30 am here, so I'm heading to bed. Good luck.
Pay me and I’ll backport mine.
Cool site, thanks for sharing. Quick question. I didn't validate this, but the end of the contests seem to align with the end date of the event that the money would go towards. For example the battle for the democratic primary ends when the democratic primary ends. Shouldn't the contests be shorter so that the money can actually be used by the candidate? Perhaps you could make the contests weekly or monthly. &amp;#x200B; The "no preference" option should probably be removed since it can't win.
haha that's my fear.. all my useless work in python 2.7 will lead to the next generation to do more useless work of converting my work.
that's fucked up
never even heard of that. is that supposed to be like a proprietary secure python?
1% will bring down the system
No. It runs on .NET, so you can write Csharp code. Is Csharp even still a thing?
I just personally hate doing useless work! I get so uninterested and angry sometimes. But yeah I've been secretly writing my own code in Python3-esqe even though the product owner keeps writing in Python2.7 and almost daily I get warned by some dependency that there will no longer be support as of Jan 1, 2020. BLEH
it's not but eventually it'll be unsupported, so why continue expending new efforts in 2.7?
I was thinking more along the line that here and there will see py modules just fail and bring down the whole system.
Thanks for the feedback, and you're spot on with thinking about the timing. Right now the primary contests are scheduled to end on Feb 11, 2020 -- this is ~3 weeks before Super Tuesday, which this year is going to be even Superer. The hope is that this timing means the funds can be deployed ahead of this most-important primary date.
that make sense. tbh I'd rather just rewrite their code base than to maintain it.
was never a thing to me any of the things you've mentioned X\_X
&gt;In my research, Flask came across as a simpler, less featured option which I figured meant a more approachable learning curve. I concur with OP. Flask is significantly easier to utilize for webhooks, apis, and the whole nine- yards
That's elegant!
I have been having issues with deploying my flask app to heroku, and ultimately resulted to using pythonanywhere. Did you receive difficulties as well?
were you a programmer prior to this?
Sign of a good language. :)
The first time I tried to deploy an app to Heroku, yes. But once I took some time to read up on Heroku's Procfile stuff it's been pretty seamless. Also, the ephemeral filesystem tripped me up big time at first, because I was just writing to files and not using a DB. What specifically hangs you up? FWIW, I also use pythonanywhere. It _is_ much more straightforward.
Have you honestly thought about mass marketing this to PACs or other campaign contribution channels? I love this decentralized and "sorta risky" approach. I have a friend who works on Elizabeth Warren campaign. I could get you political connections if you need it bro. &amp;#x200B; DISCLAIMER: I'm not selling you on anything. Just here to help you grow and give you some connections.
I have been learning how to code seriously for 5 or so years now, so yes. But this was the most complex project I've ever done, as in it had the most moving pieces and ranged in topics from front end (which is not my forte) to APIs to databases. I've touched on all of those topics in smaller projects prior to this, but this is the first time I've tried to bring them all together.

Are you Battle PAC or did you just build it for them?
This sounds like homework. This is all sounding very basic though. Like if you know python you know how to do this. Also you don't want to "import" from a file (unless it's a python file... You want to read from a file. Learn `open` built-in. Selenium or beautifulsoup are pretty good modules to get info from a website. I think you need to get more of the basics down, none of this is overly complex. Also ppl are more likely to help you if you put some code up. What have you tried?
That's amazing! I been a programmer myself for about 6 or so years so I know it can be! lol
And that is the age old fight between managers and developers. Managers are interested in the dollar, developers are interested in the tech. Sometimes you get lucky and get a manager who's also interested in the tech, and will offer you the opportunity to rewrite something. But I wouldn't count on it in a publicly traded company where profit is king. Good luck at your internship though!
One thing that always impresses me with python is it's beauty and elegance.
&gt;Is Csharp even still a thing A kinda huge thing
no, it won't be like that. I used to work with Python 2.4, 2.5 and 2.6 code. What's working will likely keep working. The problems arise when you there is a bug and a newer version of a 3rd party package fixes it, but this version isn't supporting your Python version any more. With pure Python code you can go in yourself and fix those issues somewhat easily. With C based packages it becomes a nightmare.
... Did you prime this data?
Thanks for checking it out, and I'm glad you're into it! I appreciate your offer, but as a Super PAC there are some pretty clear and strict rules around how Battle PAC can and (mostly) _cannot_ interact with any campaigns. In order to not run afoul of any of those rules, we are going to be keeping a wide berth.
I am but the developer!
Sorry, I'll write a code similar to my situation. I know a solution would be to write expression after the differentiation, but the expression itself is very long. def sol1(A, B): return diff(f(A, B), A) def sol2(A, B): return diff(g(A, B), A) def func(X): A, B = X f = [sol1(A, B), sol2(A, B)] return f Ai = 0.1 Bi = 0.1 sol = root(func, [Ai, Bi]) So the issue is, Ai and Bi are subbed into sol1 and sol2, before the sol1 and sol2 are symbolically evaluated.
Using JavaScript you could simply use the `+` operator to piece together the string in the `img.src` or `h1.innerHTML` attribute.
The economics of open source will never cease to amaze me.
Ahhh okay. Make sense, I'm well versed in PAC laws, but I'm happy to know this. Never the less, I feel more people should know about this. I'm definitely going to keep a keen eye on how this in the near future!
I see. The site looks very nice.
Thank you :')
The data on the site as of today is actual, real, donated dollars. Hopefully there will be more to come!
Another option is to make a python extension from your library. Also a nice skill to learn.
Ah, I think I see. Maybe try diff(f, A)(A, B)? It looks like f(A, B) is the problem, with it being evaluated immediately.
I joke, I just finished three summers of interning and I'm finally a full time dev. I feel deeply for the interns relegated to these types of tasks.
Learn the basic syntax first then choose what ur interested in
I feel like it is personal preference. Also, it feels almost like it is a functional programming approach rather than object oriented. Depends on which style you are using for the application.
Is C# still a thing...are you joking?
Thanks for the insight, I actually found the solution. I named new variables that evaluated sol1 and sol2 symbolically first, solution1 = sol1(A, B).subs({A:A, B:B}) solution2 = sol2(A, B).subs({A:A, B:B}) def func(X): A1, B1 = X f = [solution1.subs({A:A1, B:B1}), solution2.subs({A:A1, B:B1}) return f sol = root(func, [Ai, Bi]) this approach seems to lack finesse though.
Uhhh... I think that goes for every business as well. I have a will work for food sign permanently attached.
No. I’ve never used it.
Wrap everything but the footer in a div with “min-height 90vh” and it should work!
I'll try to do it this weekend. Sounds like a fun project.

This is awesome! I am probably in a similar skill level to you before you started this project. Started with Python for data wrangling, have done automation, and am now doing data engineering and data science work. But I have no front end experience and have no idea how to deploy something to the masses. My question for you - do you have career aspirations with learning this extra stuff, or was this more to satisfy your curiosity? While I think it's cool, I'm trying to figure out if it's worth the time. After going through this process, how do you feel about it all? What do you plan on doing with this knowledge? Thanks!
Hey Vsauce! Michael here

I know that [generateDS](https://pypi.org/project/generateDS/) does this sort of thing for XML. You may find something of use on this page: https://github.com/grundic/awesome-python-models The main thing is that you'll need a well-defined schema, as that's what you'll need to manufacture the classes.
I'm working on my very own flask website at the moment right now, I'm also a self taught python programmer! You should like me, not much of a front-end guy. How did you get separate charts by clicking on different parts of the page? Are those pills from bootstrap? Also, how do you get different graphs to load within the js? Lastly, how do you update the data that goes into the graphs as new data is created. Great work on the site! I can appreciate all the work you've done as I'm aware of the struggle it can be!
its open source, won't really die till it dies
Pybind11 is functionally the same as boost.python but with more features, better documentation, and better integrated with modern c++ idioms.

Python question, why do you need the else statement there? Is it not needed, but just best practise?
It’s not old tech. They serve different purposes.
Nightcore was a good candidate for automation because it requires little originality: simply speed up a song and add a cute image and some flashy effects. A robot can do that, because it doesn't have to create anything original, using other people's music and other people's art. The unoriginality of nightcore also makes it, like many, *many* have pointed out, vulnerable to copystrikes and copyright claims. YouTube wasn't as copyright concerned when I started work on this as it is today. What the human nightcore channels are doing, and what I will do as well, is switch to only using royalty free music.

This is cool weather api is fun to use. Dont build your strings like that first of do a format string. Second this is nit picking but sadly this is just a script not an app bud. Good stuff though. If you want to make it an app then host it online and let people use it as they please.
Believe it or not, but I agree. Nightcore was just popular enough to attract my attention and easy enough to automate, but I don't watch it personally.

Are you high? C# is absolutely still a thing. This is worse than asking "is Java still a thing?" Because not even Java devs like Java. C# is actually pleasant to use, and it's spreading.
Na. It’s ok. Unless you’re a mechanical engineer, it’s pretty niche. Also, as with with most of GitHub, my name is attached.
Congrats on your progress learning Python! :) A few things that jumped out at me, in no particular order: - I wouldn't worry about the import statements. Some people consider `from foo import *` to be bad form (they prefer you list out every single thing you use from the package), but used judiciously, it can save you some sanity. It's certainly not a problem to mix `import foo` with `from bar import baz`—that's very common. - The name of `func()` could be changed to better express what the function actually does—something like `toggle_gpio()`. - I'm not sure where the `TRUE` and `FALSE` come from—the standard Python Booleans are `True` and `False` (note the case change). - You have `if on`, followed by `elif not on`. This could more clearly be expressed as `if on`...`else`, since there's no other possibility. - Also in the category of "dumb Boolean tricks," you could reduce a little bit of code duplication in your `func()` by removing the explicit `on = False` and `on = True` and replacing it with a single `on = not on` outside your if-else block. This method of toggling a Boolean to the other possible value is "idiomatic" to Python and pretty common in the wild.
Pybind11 is very nice.
Okay! That's really clear. It's genuinely exciting that I know what you're talking about
I wouldn’t mind it but no. As I said, I’ve never used it. Big deal that I’m ignorant about it. I’m an aerospace engineer. I know Python, Fortran, and Perl as well as a lot of engineering programs.
I figure out the problem. Thank you so much for helping!
Thank you so much!
Thank you so much!
In this field, once should not live contentedly in ignorance. If you're not learning, you're getting left behind. Although I suppose you get a pass, since you're not a programmer by profession. Also, Fortran? Damn, that's a rare skill these days. Definitely respectable
Do you have any social media I can contact you with, so I can send you pictures of the code and due to the wait time I have to wait due to reddit saying “you’ve been doing this too much wait 10 minutes “. Gave me error “list index out of range on line” the code on this line is result = numbers [0]
personal preference, I suppose. There's no significant advantages or disadvantages to doing so in general
The big thing I don't see anyone mentioning is locking down your dependency versions. They will slowly but surely become python3 only, and if you don't have specific versions set to be downloaded (via requirements.txt or setup.py) , then stuff might break randomly on future builds. However there is no reason for anything to just randomly break January 1st next year. That said....light a fire under their asses and get them onto Python 3 already.
Look at the money you make as an intern. Look at the money full time devs make. As a company owner/manager/etc would you pay a fulltime dev rate for bitch work? Or would you pay an intern a shitload less to do the bitch work? Piss off the dude you have to call at 3am to save the day? Or the guy who may not be here in 3 months?
I’m fine. I know plenty of engineering. I’m develop software, but I am not a software engineer. I make tools that solve engineering problems about 1/2 the time. The other half, I’m using something like Ansys or Excel to analyze something that gets built. Fortran may be rare, but it took me 2 days to pick up. It’s a lot easier to get it to work with Python that C++.
Hey, Java is fine - I like it just as much as I like C#, they have very different but roughly equivalent (at the end of the day) issues to me. Much like how over time, every edition of windows has it's issues and is roughly just as bad/good as any other one (with 2 obvious exceptions).
Inspiring, thanks for the share!
I wanna get there. Can you tell a little background, like did you jump to Python straight away or were you working on some other technology before you started with Python ? And how are you going about your learning? Online course or books or what ?
I found a helpful video by a guy named Mosh on YouTube and followed his example. Then did some further reading of modules online a tried to implement what I found. I had never coded before yesterday
I agree it doesn't make logical sense. Just that it could have been included for the sake of backwards compatibility. But really, it's easy enough to make things backwards/forwards compatible with regard to the print syntax that any library that didn't bother was probably dead already in terms of development.
Could you add some more detail to your critique or examples
You seem to be spectacularly bad at Googling for stuff. How is it you got hired?
RemindMd! 7 Days
Just start migrating the code base. It's easier than it looks.
Good think it's open source! I hear stallman is gonna for it out into gnu/python
The abstract on that video seems misleading. I was expecting to find out about some async pitfalls - specific usage, were pythons async support is very slow, maybe to the point of being slower that synchronous calls. But the video is just a basic async introduction.
Best to start looking for a new company
.... Fine. I will begrudgingly admit that Java, as a language, is actually pretty pleasant to use. Just don't ever tell anyone I admitted that, I'll absolutely deny it
The police are not gonna come knocking on the door forcing your company to upgrade. They will put it off indefinitely unless they have a strong enough reason to. "Unsupported" doesn't mean much, especially for internal tools. Python 2.7 works today, and it will work tomorrow, and next year, and next decade, etc
1 bit can bring down a system
All the very best
The Github API has a “/license” endpoint on “repo” resources that provides all of the information that you’d likely be interested in for this bot. We use that API in https://github.com/zachwick/homebrew-license to show license information for Homebrew formulae.
My first thought is to append A to B to create a combined frame C (append), sort C on index (sort_index), then pad (fillna) forward the count column so each index has a count value. Then you should have a new frame (C), that has indexes that match A (and B) with the "most recent" count value from B. You can then either query C directly based on the desired index, or you could join (join) the count column from C back to A based on index. There's probably some fancier, snappier way to get it done, but again that's my initial thought.
Modern java especially. I jump back and forth between many languages and C#/Java are some of the easiest to transition between and some of the least painful overall. I will say (whilst ducking) that I do have a special place in my heart for perl. It is definitely quite the fucky language, but you can make it do whatever you want in a totally legible fashion, it just takes work for the legible part. The whatever you want part is SUPER easy though.

Where do you get your punchcards for your FORTRAN programs? :)
At least I’ve never used floating point to binary, coral, or bitwise operators :p FORTRAN 77 is really not bad other than the subroutines.
I haven't done fortran in years (I did learn it on a PDP11 with punch cards), but I do remember liking it.
valuable interns won't be coming back to bitch work. they're suppose to sell interns their company.
..not that you have to be that old to have used punch cards.. I just started when I was really young :-)
The whole unsupported argument is mostly a scarecrow. I've literally never seen anyone update a bug fix python release on a windows system.
On the flip side of that coin, if you ask me to do bitchwork after crunchtime, I'm out.
I'm out in 2 months!

You are already doing it to sum(). Just do that to n instead of sum.
Awesome! Way to go!
It's bad practice even if you had some code there and flagged by most linters.
Redeemed by the one true line ending.
Yeah, good idea, let the interns update the whole codebase. No way will they fuck it up.
Pybind11 is nothing short of amazing. Really simple to work with and has still been able to do everything I've needed.
I will try it. Thanks.
If you are wrapping existing c++ code then pybind11 is a lot better choice since cython has more limitations (or at least had when I last tried). Cython is awesome to speed up existing python code though.
Congrats on your first coding! Let us know if we can help out (PMs welcome if you want more focused help)
Looks interesting. Do you think it's possible to code in C++ and create the GUI with Python using cpython?
Hey this is really cool. You're interacting with the outside world from a GUI interface - pretty good stuff for a first effort. Most of your code is framework code: creating tk elements and passing functions to them is fine. However that process is actually a pretty advanced concept in general. I'm referring to func and closefunc. Normally you declare functions and then call them yourself in sequence, but because this is Tk code you've jumped in at the deepend. You mentioned you felt it wasn't stuck together particularly well. Most commonly you see a function called main which you will put lots of the extra stuff into to tidy up your code. That way when you run your script it will be read from top to bottom without executing anything much. Then at the bottom you will see many scripts have a special pattern: if __name__ == "__main__": main() That way you can move your functions around and it won't matter the order they appear in the script because the main function, which does all the work , only gets called at the very end. The special pattern is nothing you need to worry about. In case you're curious about why, what it does is makes sure other scripts can import functions from your script that they want without running your main function.
Best part of your comment is that it is invalid as Python 3.
Or maybe don't consider helping keep your code up to date 'bitch work'.
I'm currently moving some old projects forward using [https://pypi.org/project/lib3to6/](https://pypi.org/project/lib3to6/)
I don't consider keeping things up to date bitchwork in the general case, but if a company treats keeping things up to date as bitchwork relegated to interns then it will be bitch work no matter who does it. If the company doesn't consider keeping up to date important and it is tedious and takes time, it will become bitch work. Work the company doesn't care about, will not allocate time/resources properly for, and will push the developer to complete in inappropriate time frames. That is bitchwork.
Okay! So what would you suggest I put into this main function and how would I call it? Do you have any material I could reference?
This is a wonderful response. Thank you so very much!
We wouldn't want to delete some innocent Python 3 executable would we?
Hmm... makes sense 🤔
SyntaxError exception as flow control. It's evil. I like it.
Shouldn't be a problem except for the time commitment. It's just a lot of work to write out that c++&lt;-&gt;python interface, and likely a lot of planning and spec'ing it out first. I believe you already did most of it in c++... Any reason not to just write the full GUI in c++ as well? It isn't too hard to interface the two but I'd consider which is more work in the end. It's an extra layer you don't need if you just do the GUI in C++
Dope. Decorating.
My company uses a C++ compiler from the 90's. It doesn't work on modern OS's, so we keep a XP virtual machine to build it. The database we use is proprietary and abandoned by the vendor years ago. People still pay for our software.

it seems to not be traversing the entire sorted list just the first indice, I'm confused why?
Why don't you use collections.Counter. you can initialize it with a list
I have no idea what that is, I'm sorry. Is that a command?
Maybe look into the Counter class from collections module. Here's an example. from collections import Counter myList = [4, 3, 2, 7, 8, 2, 3, 1] c = Counter(myList) output = [] for v in c.items(): if v[1] &gt; 1: output.append(v[0]) print(output)
We've been migrating to py3 for all of the 9 years I've been at my job. :'D
It's a class in the stdlib `from collections import Counter` It's essentially a dict that holds values and their number of occurence - you can then easily take all those that have a value greater than one
Pip won't install a python 3 version of a lib if your on py2 pretty sure. Otherwise stuff would already be breaking
thank you so much. Just a quick question do people study the important modules python has to offer or do people come across these by simply coincidence?
Because your return is in the for loop Not outside
But we build our own runtime so it's not like anyone considers it urgent... :P
OH MY GOD
For people whose job depends on writing Python, knowing what Python modules have to offer is probably something most developers will have to go through. If not, then probably by coincidence or encounter a problem and Google or forums suggest the solution involving employing specific modules.
What could affect you is if one of the many packages you depend on drops py2 support completely then you'll have to pin its last good version in your requirements list so you can keep updating and deploying the code base.
This should def be a list comp

Hey man, Aerospace/Mechanical Engineer here! Is it PyNastran needs help? I'd actually help with that if you're in a python 3 bind. We've chatted before - I'm at NASA MSFC and have plenty of co-workers who use NASTRAN, possibly even who use pyNastran.
Cool cool are you a software engineer?
Fortran 2008 is really not a bad language - you can write legible, fast, and maintainable numerical code in it quite easily. It's not your grandmother's stack of punch cards with implicit variables, common blocks, and short lines.
Nope. Just someone who picked up Python by accident.
Red Hat will maintain 2.7 for years to come because it's covered under RHEL 7.
You'd want to use that special pattern for the code that you want to run if you specifically execute this .py file. In other words if you use this, then all the code inside main() will not execute if you imported this script in another py file and execute that one. This basically makes the file usable as a library (with import) or script/app (direct execution).
Thank you.
Yup, learn the basics syntax, learn functions, learn classes, then try to build something of your interest. From there, learn how you can optimize what you've built. Learn testing. Learn design patterns and different approaches on how to build something (e.g functional programming vs OOP). Then dive into concepts such as understanding memory management (garbage collection, etc). There's really not a set in stone way to do it. Start small and keep the snowball rolling.
Do u really have to get into memory management for python

it's amazing,can you share the code ,it 's very cool!
Well, you said it. Unsupported. Which means, that you will no longer get any updates. But it will still work fine.
It's always good practice to understand how things under the hood work, at least to an extent. Especially when you begin diving into more complex software systems bc it can and will be a determining factor on how to approach different situations.
Same thats what I thought too. One change I would make is to set time as the index. Remember to remove duplicates as right after appending A and B (instead of append you can also do a fill join with filling na with forward fill). This can be done with one single join call. Setting time as an index allows you to slice what you need instead of joining with A. ```C.loc[&lt;times_in_A&gt;, :]```
are else statements considered bad practice?
After \`raise\`, \`return\`, or \`break\`, yes.
i heard the if statement was harmful so that makes sense
What a stupid comment.

Really recommend you to check this list of Python courses: [https://www.bitdegree.org/tutorials/best-python-courses/](https://www.bitdegree.org/tutorials/best-python-courses/) I found some good stuff here. Hope it will be useful to you too.
Okay nice! I have done a project where i scraped vinyl record coverart from discogs and then made a resnet try to classify the records release century (60, 70s, 80s) [https://github.com/KasperJuunge/Deep-Learning-Vinyl-Records](https://github.com/KasperJuunge/Deep-Learning-Vinyl-Records) . I think PyTorch is great! I have actually not used TF that much, so i can't say much about how it is compared to TF :p
I'm jumping ahead for you, but only because I don't want to confuse you about what I mean. It would be a good exercise to do this yourself. You want to take the stuff you have done at "module level" ie with no indentation, besides function declarations, constant declarations, and imports, and put it into another function declaration. def main(): GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM) GPIO.setup(18,GPIO.OUT) on = FALSE root = Tk() root.protocol('WM_DELETE_WINDOW', closefunc) the_label = Label(root, text='Hello') the_label.pack() button = Button(root, text="RECORD", fg='Red', bg='white', font='futura', relief=RAISED, command=func) button.pack() root.mainloop() if __name__ == "__main__": main() That last line with the open-and-close-parentheses is a function call. It's the normal way to call a function, which may seem weird but it's only because we are calling the function without any inputs (also known as arguments). In Tk something else is calling the functions func and closefunc, you're actual passing them in without calling them when you write them here - they only get called (aka run) when the button is pressed and when the window is closed, respectively.

I remember, earlier in my career, having to ensure all the PHP (ick) code I wrote not only worked on a modern version (5.2? 5.3?) but also on some older EOL version (5.0? 5.1) as well because there were clients (paying devs by the hour) too cheap to upgrade their $20/mo hosting plan.
 from collections import Counter nums = \[4, 3, 2, 7, 8, 2, 3, 1\] print(sorted(k for k, v in Counter(nums) if v &gt; 1))
In terms of reference material I would say either Wikipedia or the official python tutorial, depending on whether you want more information on python syntax or if you want more information on computer science concepts mentioned in the python tutorial. If you have a bit of a mathematics background you will probably find these resources useful. If you don't and you are finding it a bit dry you might find it easier to do more tutorials that help you solve problems you like. Learning by doing is what its all about, but official documentation can really speed you along rather than getting bogged down in doing tutorials that have you writing out boilerplate you don't understand well. It's up to what works for you.
It won't get security updates (at least in theory), and neither will any libraries dropping Py2 support (which is probably worse). So many people in this thread saying it doesn't matter are living in fantasy land, or working for companies that never gave a fuck about patching their vulnerabilities in the first place.
These are clearly not comparable to the Python change. a) the attack surface of a C++ compiler left in compiled executables is pretty small. The most it can do is link an old STL. Python is probably 50x as big, and the stdlib covers much more "dangerous" stuff such as networking and file handling. b) databases are internal systems, rarely exposed to the world, and not reliant on ecosystems of libraries that will stop getting updates (as Py2 will) c) if "people pay us" is your only standard for engineering, you're part of the reason software security is such a shitshow.
Is your company OK with exposing their clients to unpatched vulnerabilities? Would it survive a "doomsday" scenario if any of its products causes a major security breach? If the answer is "no", then running software with no kind of security support is irresponsible and dangerous. Sad to see so many apologists for poor engineering in this thread.

Not much experience here, but I feel like this can all be taken care of by CI. Put the latest nightly or subversion at the end of the pipeline to alert you of potential issues with the new version but don't fail the pipeline because of it.
This is awesome! But please tell me you’ve had a lawyer sign off on it...campaign finance laws are...fun.
I didn't say it was a good thing. It's common with enterprise software.
Wow! That's cool! I'll give it a look, we can do something together!
Not at all, but consider what it's doing here. Other comments are discussing that since it follows a `raise`, it's not necessary, and this is correct to a point, but what if the `raise` was just a `print` in this example? else: pass This statement never serves a purpose. If the else was not there then the program would continue execution after the `if`, whether it was taken or not. If you put the `else` there, the program will continue execution after the `if`, whether it was taken or not. It might take the `else`, where it does... nothing. `pass` is something of a strange construct in Python, and whenever you type it you should take a moment to consider whether it's necessary. It's certainly got its uses as a temporary placeholder for code that you haven't fleshed out yet but wouldn't be syntactically correct without something there, but in finished code it nearly always points to something that should be removed. After all, "do nothing" isn't really a useful instruction in a program.
I would ask your mentor, that is what they're there for. Assuming the rest of the site is Flask server side rendering Jinja2 templates then it would make more sense to do it like that. However if there's some especially rich front end interactions you could consider adding a front end framework like react to deal with them, but that seems like overkill and out of your scope if you're new to a team and project.
I recently did this with the help of \`\`cffi\`\` and it works surprisingly easy and well. Added bonus is the immediate compatibility with Pypy.
You need a colon after your if statement and after the else statement to create the blocks

# It would be funny if they have the following work around in Python 3? # Import * from past
uhm i don't think stripper is a good function name. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
assert would be better for this I think.
But can't you just enforce that with numpy scalar type while still benefitting from numpy numerical power?
I was told function names should be descriptive. I added the cheekiness all by myself :D
It's a fine approach, I've seen people do it. But ask whoever is in charge.
It is definitely possible, but as has been alluded to already. When extending an existing solution it is often better to stay within the current tool stack. Only introduce new tool if the benefits far outweigh the added complexity and maintenance costs.
&gt; And even then python would have to refuse to patch that. And even then any other organization would have to refuse to fork the interpreter with a patch.
Rust is a compiled, strongly-typed language. Python is a scripting language. Rust will never replace Python. It might conceivably replace C++ - I haven't used it but I hear great things of it.
You are lucky. I have to work with that pile of IronPython s..... daily, because thats the only thing our RPA platform supoorts.
The potential issues are not due to accessing the available data. Websites don't allow scraping due to the magnitude of requests that bots make. It adds a lot of stress on their servers if there are multiple scrapers around that hit their webpages a thousand times a second. Combined with the loss of ad revenue, it's understandable why they don't allow it. APIs provide a nice middle ground where the developers can build a bot, the server can limit the number of times the bot makes access and you pay a small fee for using it.
X = Input(What's 2x2?) If x = 4: Print(Correct) Else: raise ValueError('That calculation does not work.')
You can convert .py to .exe and run it as an all in one
x = int(input("Whats 2x2? \n")) if x == (4): print("CORRECT") else: print("WRONG") I fixed it
 x = input('What is 4x4?) if int(x) == 4: print('Correct') else: print('Incorrect') You bind the return value of the input-function to the variable x, so you should check the value of x. Since input() returns a string you need to cast it to a numerical data type to check it against the correct answer. In this case I've cast it to an integer. In the if-else statement you need to use colons after each statement (as pointed out before) and you need to indent your code properly.

"FFI" stands for *foreign function interface*, meaning a mechanism by which code in one language can call into code written in another language. Traditionally, for Python the most popular language to interface with has been C. Many people have written wrappers to allow Python code to call into popular C libraries, for example, and performance-critical modules often are written in C exposing a Python interface. There's no requirement, though, for C to be the only such language (and some popular Python modules use other languages, such as C++ or Fortran). The linked talk discusses possible merits of instead having Python interface with code written in Rust.
C'MON HICKENLOOPER!!
you can also go with a more functional programming approach: `duplicates = set(filter(lambda x: inout.count(x) &gt; 1, input))` If you need a list you can cast against the result to list.
Automating my budgeting project
Well IMHO, It wouldn't be like Y2K. However after 5 months, it doesn't get supported for official anymore. So it seems that there would be no problem but risk for some securty issue.
ArcGIS still uses python 2.7. It is inconsistent and slow. Be warned.
Nothing you say is wrong, and I've written plenty of C (and C++) that interfaces with Python, but I don't see how it at all invalidates my point. What's the argument that Rust is a likely replacement for Python?
Spam
&gt; After all, "do nothing" isn't really a useful instruction in a program. Its useful as a marker that the un-handled case is intentionally unhandled. You should put that in comments as well, but in this case I'd be happy with a little redundancy.
The title is "Rust is the next Python FFI" not "Rust is the next Python"
You have 2to3.py. I suggest you use that too the best of your ability.

Among other situations already mentioned, it also depends on the platform you're running the old code/environment on. If old code is running isolated on a docker container, it should be pretty well contained.
What's the official tutorial?
I think I understand. If I only plan on running this by itself it'd be fine, but if I plan on using this button elsewhere as a module then it's an issue. So in theory I could design all the components of my program in this way, then assemble them in another script as modules
Don't forget to add a license.
&gt; What's the argument that Rust is a likely replacement for Python? The argument is you misread the title, because it has nothing to do with replacing Python; it has to do with replacing C as the default compiled language Python code interfaces with via FFI.

A typical use case is to write tests in another file, so making sure you can import your functions into your test file without running the whole program code is standard practice.
It totally depends what you're building. Using React/Redux is more complex than just rendering an HTML template in Flask. What are you getting from your frontend tools that you can't get from static HTML? Is this actually important for the success of your project? Why?

Perfect! Thank you
I see little reason to use numpy for variables that should always be scalars. It is, in fact, slower than the math module and will fail silently if I don't add more code making it uglier. &amp;#x200B; Anyways, this is by no means any sort of bottleneck, numpy spends 500 ns per call to sqrt with a scalar input on my computer, math spends 100 ns. Not a noticable difference for something that only happens a handful of times each iteration. &amp;#x200B; The bottleneck of my code is the gradient and loss computations which are computed for every iteration and has complexity *O(nmp)* where *n* is the number of data points, *m* is the number of features and *p* is the number of target vectors (*dim(y)*).
I used Taiga a few years ago and was very happy with it. Although I now feel that most of what I used Taiga for can be replaced by Gitlab. And since most of my projects are source code based it ties in nicely. Even if you have a project that is not source code based you can still use a Gitlab project to do a lot of simple project management tasks.
Why? Are you running multiple event loops on multiple threads or something?
Makes sense you're right!
Why are waiting to set the event inside the loop? The event is threadsafe, just set it when the event is ready. Given your example, I don't fully understand your use case. You seem to be confusing asyncio and threading concepts, and their safety needs.
I'm using Django channels, the problem is that Django has inherent threading, and thus If I want to call these things from the response cycle I need to implement locking.
Not event though. Event is safe to set from another thread, that's why it exists. If something is ready, call set.
Probably some company will come along and offer you extended security and bug fixes for $$$$ and your company will pay $$$$ because they think it's cheaper than upgrading.
Waiting on an asyncio event from a different thread/loop produces an error.
Yea, I edited but you saw it too quick. Don't call wait_for.
Qt is LGPL, at least for everything tk does.
If you have the freedom to look at react, maybe Vue or angular could also work. You could do a bit of research on that matter
&gt; It is built entirely with Flask, but I am wondering if it would be good practice to include React.JS for my frontend and keep Flask for the backend for my section of the website? How would this affect authentication and authorization? You have to look at how this integrates with the web portal in general. These are architecturally different things with different requirements around token behaviors. Knowing nothing else of the project, I'd say you make this in Flask. Consistency across the project is more valuable than anything react is going to bring in. If you want to make particular parts of the page richer with JS, you can use preact widgets.
How would I set a timeout without wait\_for?
And in ten years we'll get blog posts like "building python2.7 on Debian 20 for shits and giggles"
Yes I'm writing this to use with django channels, And thus need to be able to synchronize over multiple threads.
Why post this on a English language forum?
Reschedule the wait function continuously until the event is set. But, I don't think this is right for your use case. I feel like I'm missing something and solving a problem that shouldn't exist.
Loss of support does matter, but not in the immediate short term. If you have Python 2.7 projects that don't see a lot of development (or use) and the cost of upgrading to 3+ is greater than the cost of maintaining the project in 2.7 2.7, then there is not nearly as much reason to upgrade. If you have a 2.7 project that is something like a payment processor or a web API or some package that is used by a lot of other projects, then yeah, you need to get that thing upgraded. If it's just an internal tool for something inconsequential, then what's the point?
I'm working on Swift
Python 2 apps will work and continue to work just fine for a period of time. Eventually the dependencies will degrade then there will be some critical bug or need to update some critical dependency very quickly and you won't be able to do it. The company will suffer and/or potentially go out of business since you can't recreate months/years of work in one sprint. You will potentially be able to hack together something working again, but you only get so many shots at this process before your application becomes utterly unmaintainable.
Did you notice this event is an asyncio event?
Video game developers that use the Unity game engine use C#, so its growing in use in that sector, and many companies that used Java are switching to C# along with Microsift's core.net framework.
Until it's not because using strings and bytes interchangeably has infected the system like an aggressive cancer that spreads it's infection to anyone working on the code base and eats away at them internally until they're a husk if their former self looking forward to the day when they either before one with the cancer or they die. ....

Where are your fingers?
Nice. I like the breadcrumbs
What problem are you trying to solve?
As long as the package maintainer marks it correctly, yes. But I know that stuff like IPython and other packages did (and maybe still do, I did not check) push Python3 only code with Python2 labels that had a check to specifically say "this version does not work with Python2 anymore, please set your package manager to only download the 4.x version" or similar to give a heads to those still on python 2. In the process breaking people's setups.
I previewed the content for "Microservices with Docker, Flask, and React" and it looks fantastic! I will definitely pick it up today. Thanks for the info.
Me too! Really enjoying python. What method are you using to learn out of interest?

Hi, you need to create list of tasks and run them, check the sample from asyncio documentation https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html#running-tasks-concurrently
Remember the location. It'll be a quest point when trying to bring down Skynet.
Creating a specialized component like `breadcrumb` can be done using either a class or function syntax, if that's what you mean. In the actual web page code, using Django model syntax wouldn't be practical i think.
The channels docs [explain how to do this](https://channels.readthedocs.io/en/latest/deploying.html#nginx-supervisor-ubuntu) \- while they are many ways of doing it, they use supervisor to spawn multiple threads. If you are using kubernetes or something then you can simply scale up/down your service. Alternatively, you could use gunicorn with the Uvicorn worker, and manually specify the number of threads there.
thanks :)

I'd do a left join A to B. Then create a flag for if time in A matches time B. Then you can do a simply group by. &amp;#x200B; import pandas as pd &amp;#x200B; import pandas as pd # create 2 data frames. b has 3 times that overlap with a a = pd.DataFrame({'time': {0: '12:00:01', 1: '12:17:42', 2: '12:52:13',3: '12:52:03'}}) b = pd.DataFrame({'time2': {0: '12:00:01', 1: '12:17:00', 2: '12:52:03',3: '12:52:03'}}) # merge dataframes match_df = a.merge(b, how='left', left_on='time', right_on='time2') # check if times match - assumes same dtype. Then map True/false to 1/0 match_df.loc[:,'time_match_flg'] = (match_df.time == match_df.time2).map({True:1, False:0}) # group by and put results back in dataframe results = match_df.groupby('time')['time_match_flg'].sum() results.to_frame().reset_index()
So I've implemented a main function. However it has broken my other functions. &amp;#x200B; If you have a look at my function called "func" it references button that is now inside my main. Is there a way to pass that button to another function or will I have to globally define the button?

How is this added to the actual webpage? Is the function added as a Jinja global environment variable?
yes

Thanks! And yeah, we definitely have lawyers and consultants specializing in elections making sure we are doing everything by the books.
Not sure if this will help, but still [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45947971/overlay-scatter-plot-on-map-img](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45947971/overlay-scatter-plot-on-map-img)
I didn't, but the solution still seems out of place.
It appears I lived under rock cause I did not know that such thing exists in real world

On your last point about dumb boolean tricks, I'm not entirely sure what you mean. Where in the code would I insert the on = not on? Would it be in the place of on = False?
thats fucking weird. good job.
I believe he's talking this Original: `self.url = "https://api.weather.gov/points/" + str(self.lat) + "," + str(self.lon)` Suggestion(python2 friendly): `self.url = "https://api.weather.gov/points/{},{}".format(str(self.lat), str(self.lon))` Suggestion(python3): `self.url = f"https://api.weather.gov/points/{str(self.lat)},{str(self.lon)}"`
If you are not familiar with how to set up http requests to your backend, then no. If you are, then yes. If you think you could learn it easily, then maybe.

Porting an application from Python 2 to Python 3 and having to now use asyncio which has led me into descending into the madness of an async creep viral infection throughout the entire code base, golangs coroutines are now starting to look quite attractive.
This is the full login page example from the readme (no Jinja or actual HTML at all): ```python from markyp_html import webpage from markyp_html.forms import form from markyp_bootstrap4 import req from markyp_bootstrap4.layout import container, one, col, margin, offset from markyp_bootstrap4.buttons import b_button from markyp_bootstrap4.forms import form_group, form_check, form_check_label, input_, text def login(): return form( form_group( text.h5("Email"), input_.email(placeholder="Enter your email address") ), form_group( text.h5("Password"), input_.password(placeholder="Enter your password") ), form_check( input_.checkbox(), form_check_label("Remember Me"), class_=margin(bottom=2) ), b_button.primary("Sign In", type="submit") ) page = webpage( # This is from markyp-html, all the required scaffolding container( # The root bootstrap container one( # One bootstrap column login(), # The content -&gt; login form md=6, # Width: 6 columns class_=offset(md=3) # Offset: 3 columns so it's in the middle of the page ) ), page_title="markyp-bootstrap4 example", # Page title head_elements=[ req.bootstrap_css, # Bootstrap CSS import *req.all_js # Bootstrap JS imports ] ) ```
Haha yeah, certainly sounds like we have similar backgrounds. The pills are from bootstrap. The D3 script creates a div for all three graphs and makes them all on page load. The bootstrap magic from the pill navs handles hiding/displaying the content of specific tabs. In flask in my routes.py i instantiate an instance of a class that handles the data fetching in my index() method. So whenever index is loaded this object pulls data from the db and formats it as needed, and then through the Jinja templating I can call this classes methods to have it spit out the data I need in the template and access it w D3 from there.
But of course you can pass `login()` to a Jinja render method and use `{ str(login()) }` in the Jinja template if you would like to mix the two.
Yeah. That’s pretty much my exact situation. It’s mostly been to satisfy my curiosity. I’m a data guy in my day job and I really enjoy that, and know that I’m much more capable in that arena than with full stack or front end dev work. I just like being able to do things, make things. I’ve got a lot of super creative friends and have a good idea of my own every once in a while, so I just want to always be in a place where I can confidently execute on any of these ideas whenever a good one crops up.
that's pretty funny and I wouldn't be surprised if there was such a thing :)
I knew it
It was super easy. We are using a donation platform called Qgiv, and they’ve been great. They handle all the payments. All I had to do was load their donation widget in an iframe on the site. Then I have some infra built around their API so that our data visualizations are always up to date.
Took a break from Automate The Boring Stuff to make a program on my own. It's a randomizer that picks a movie to watch. The bulk import right now is through a text file. Once I learn CSV's I'll move to them as they would be better to handle and keep it down to one files, then eventually move it to a site once I learn API's
But of course you can pass login() to a Jinja render method and use { str(login()) } in the Jinja template if you would like to mix the two.
Yes if you format your data as a geojson you can plot it in a chloropleth rather easily in Folium. If you need to assign your data to regions you should look at geopandas to manipulate teh data into the geographically related items.
Nice, I was looking for something like this. Quick question, are the keywords case sensitive or should I add every possible combination independently in the key\_list ?
Rarely, but sometimes and much less than in C. Kinda depends on your target system and tool. Back in the days of 2 GB of RAM systems, having inefficiency in how you store the data could mean your 500 MB file cannot be loaded. So maybe it required 5GB. That problem scales, so now a 6 GB file requires 60 GB of RAM. Another example is memory leakage. Run your code 10000 times and check the memory usage each time. What is common to see is a slope, a small drop, repeat that 10 times, a large drop, and repeat. If it comes back to your starting memory, that is not a leak, but you are wasting say 20x more RAM than you need to due to poor garbage collection.
They are case sensitive, but if you give me about an hour I can fix that
The main advantage I could think of would be for unit tests, so as you can supply data to the class without using the external call. That may not be significant enough though.
A database for storing interesting blog posts. At the moment it implements automatic title extraction and suggested tags before storing in Sqlite database. Next step will be to reimplement in a web app on Django and React

Hey all, I'm new to computer science and I have a question about these sorts of discussions: isn't it dangerous to be sharing your ideas like this? Couldn't someone just scoop up your comment and develop your idea without permission? I'm not trying to seem rude, I'm just trying to understand: when I talk about coding ideas in-person in-public, I get scolded for 'spilling my secrets'? How is that any different from permanently posting your ideas on the internet? Have a good day y'all.
Thanks for the reply! Looks like the MIT course has already started but I’ll keep an eye on upcoming batches.
Thank you for the reply and resource! I’ll go through it as well!
damn it github formatting from markyp_html import webpage from markyp_html.forms import form from markyp_bootstrap4 import req from markyp_bootstrap4.layout import container, one, col, margin, offset from markyp_bootstrap4.buttons import b_button from markyp_bootstrap4.forms import form_group, form_check, form_check_label, input_, text def login(): return form( form_group( text.h5("Email"), input_.email(placeholder="Enter your email address") ), form_group( text.h5("Password"), input_.password(placeholder="Enter your password") ), form_check( input_.checkbox(), form_check_label("Remember Me"), class_=margin(bottom=2) ), b_button.primary("Sign In", type="submit") ) page = webpage( container( one( login(), md=6, class_=offset(md=3) ) ), page_title="markyp-bootstrap4 example", head_elements=[ req.bootstrap_css, *req.all_js ] ) print(page)

Pushed a commit, keywords and blacklisting shouldn’t be case sensitive anymore
Its archived later on, so it doesnt matter unless you want a certificate.
Even better! I don’t really care much for certifications at this point, just want to get my learning started.

I would suggest to use only Flask, if it's a bigger project. If a smaller, then create an API with flask (with JWT auth) and rebuild the whole frontend. I don't like to see half flask, half react, half other framework/library frontend. And it's hard to maintain it, of course. But depends on project.
Quick explanation for the `print()` call at the end. All `markyp`, `markyp-html` and `markyp-bootstrap4` (and in fact `markyp-rss`, i've implemented RSS 2 as well) elements/components/higher order components return either a `markyp` `IElement` or a `string`. In the end, you get the actual markup document by calling `str(element)` which `print` implicitly does. So if you have the above code in say `demo.py`, you should just execute `python3 demo.py &gt; demo.html` and you have the HTML page. Of course you easily use these elements with any web framework.
Once worked in a place where interns were ordered to make a physical Jira board 😂
I own a few DJ/stage lights that I put on my home network (with a dmx over Ethernet adapter) and I wrote some software to make it sound reactive... but it needs more patterns it's trippy
Since its fairly new it means its still coming out. But once its all archived its there forever. You’ll have limited access to it cuz edx is trash but just make a new account and continue where u left off. Good luck!
No clue how the Italian economy is. Thought you made quality products and have a labor shortage.
