When I got to my job, I found people doing this ''' import __init__ __init__.func() '''
I used to do it. Reason: it worked.
AFAIK it's not even Python doing that, it's that interactive terminals are line-buffered (not entirely unbuffered) while pipes &amp; al are fully buffered.
FWIW it really depends on your use case. Basically, stdout will tend to be line-buffered (or even unbuffered) on interactive output (when running from a shell) and fully buffered on non-interactive output (running from an other program or to a pipe). Buffering makes printing much cheaper, but of course there's no output whatsoever until the buffer is flushed (either explicitly or because it's full).

Could also be because books and tutorials tent to focus on syntax rather than design, and many programmers studying a language don't get as far as reading higher-level books or other people's code. Could also be because too many programmers don't pay attention to aesthetics, and don't much care if their code looks nice or feels right - they get each thing to work then stop. Actually now you've mentioned it, maybe Python linting tools should include a check of `__init__.py` and warning if it contains anything other than imports and constants declarations.
This post is better suited for r/learnpython 
&gt; probably leading into some kind of scam A lot of times they include a link but to their site. So the scam is that they are trying to use your site to get SEO juice for theirs. Which is dumb because Google (if you believe the pundits) knows about this scam and accounts for it.
For starters Python and if you you know a little about microprocessors and registers it will be helpful..
Not sure, but maybe it says in the article linked?
Off topic, can someone tell me which text editor/IDE the guy is using (not Vim, the other one)?
ok thanks
Testing if a container is not empty using `if my_container:` ***is*** pythonic. Ignore the author of the article.
Yeah. something like vscode would be much better if you *really* don't want to learn any of the other editors. Once you start playing with code completion, its hard to go back. 
Plain wrong
Dude must not know about which data types are mutable or not...

Thanks for the suggestion. I ran pyannotate on one of my functions and it tells me the type is PyIStorage. However, I don't know where to import PyIStorage from in pywin32. Maybe I need to use robert_mcleod's suggestion and annotate as a string.
"using python 3". Damn, every part of the title is incorrect. &gt; Find all users connected to wifi network What is actually shown is a list of broadcasting/visible SSIDs. None of these are 'users', none of these are necessarily 'connected to wifi network'. &gt; using Python 3 Well no, it's using `netsh` to find this list.
For all those loc counts, I was using cloc and only counting python lines of code. If many of your files have 50+ import statements, that smacks of code smell to me. This isn't to say there can never be a usage for it (e.g., IPython does has one file with 66 imports). That said, I scanned a different venv, I found a couple examples (tensorflow, sympy) where there were in excess of 50 imports by the method list above. Granted every checked example, they *could* easily be reduced to under 50 imports if you imported multiple objects from a module using the syntax: from x.y.z import (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z) instead of having 26 import lines in the above example. They also were generally not in files with actual code, but were files that exposed a API (e.g., make it easy to import multiple things from a single file). E.g., the one example with 204 imports in sympy (`sympy/polys/compatibility.py`) is broken down in 9 groups. $ cat sympy/polys/compatibility.py | grep import | cut -d' ' -f1-3 | sort | uniq -c 1 from __future__ import 62 from sympy.polys.densearith import 10 from sympy.polys.densebasic import 35 from sympy.polys.densetools import 45 from sympy.polys.euclidtools import 30 from sympy.polys.factortools import 1 from sympy.polys.galoistools import 18 from sympy.polys.rootisolation import 1 from sympy.polys.sqfreetools import 1 from sympy.utilities import
That doesn't seem like a good reason. 
The strangest part is he confused type coercion / implicit casting with duck typing... Truthyness is just a subset of type coercion (and in some languages implicit casting, there's a minute difference. Saying truthiness is bad is like saying addition and multiplication across different numeric types is bad. I mean if you explicitly want to test for boolean True just prefix your conditional with `isinstance(x, bool) and` (or the equivalent in other languages).
This is a great example of why Flask is not a good framework for this type of solution. Something like Turbogears or Django is a much better fit. To do this type of project means rolling your own everything which is already included in frameworks like Turbogears and Django. For example, admin tools and authentication are also required. Add to that, his models really isn't the database model but simply function calls masking low level DB access. Which is where something like an ORM further simplifies things. Again, something which Turbogears (SQLAlchemy) and Django already address.
Has anyone else picked this up? If not I'd like to look at the api
Is this possible in Atom?

try `ls -l` on your `site-packages` directory. Its not saved in any store that I know of, highly doubt it
This kind of stuff is even worse with JavaScript. The IDE you use can help. For example use autocomplete when typing variable names, class attributes etc, this way you can avoid just writing the wrong name. On the other hand that is how bugs are made, strongly typed languages that require declaring variables can help minimize that. But dynamic languages like python prioritize ease and flexibility over strong and early error discovery. Remember that programming in language is not like programming in another. 
An IDE like PyCharm does help. Secondly, in a lot of scenarios, updating the state of an object should be done using methods. A typo in a method call will throw an error. Now, only the method needs to take care of using the correct attribute name, reducing chances of such errors. 
Thanks man
I would also say that decorators and higher order functions are a really valuable tool that you should know how to use.
I am also curious what he is working on. Please share!
`pip` doesn't store this information. As mentioned before, the only way to check is to look at the file system's records of write/update times?
This error is telling you that you can't add a str to an int. For a str type + is concatenation, and for an ont it is addition. You appear to be trying for concatenation, so you would need to cast the ints returned from randint using str(). Alternatively, ypu could use str.format or an f-string: "{}.{}.{}.{}".format(a, b, c, d) or f"{a}.{b}.{c}.{d}" in python 3 if I'm recalling correctly.
Hi! For questions like this, you should visit r/learnpython, as that subreddit is more tailored towards helping new Pythonistas. With that in mind, I might as well answer your question here: `TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'` is Python's way of telling you that it does not know what the + sign should do when the object to the left is of type `int`, and the object to the right is of type `str`. One way of remedying this is by first casting the integer variables to a string. I.e., partOne = str(random.randint(150, 200)) A more involved way is to use the .join and map functions. fullIP = ".".join(map(str, [partOne, partTwo, partThree, partFour])) However, if you're just starting out this might be a bit advanced. Google it :) 
Okay, then learn it if you want to make an android app.

Truthiness is whether or not a value is considered true values in a condition. Like `None`, `()`, and `{}` are considered False, and a nonempty list is considered true.
It should be the same, I guess it's the matter of preference what to use.
I also want to try to use some sort of speech recognition instead of subtitles, it should make a problem with gathering dataset a bit easier. But not sure if it wouldn't be too hard.
No.

Looks like it never worked. 
Ah okay, if your Docker host is on a different network this will be hard to get to work. PyCharm uses a random port to connect to debuggers / python console Let me think if there's a way to get this to work, I'm not sure if there is a way other than a VPN though.
Out of interest, what's the advantages of using a command-line editor compared to a full blown IDE? I know when I'm just doing tiny scripts I'll use nano usually. I've always used PyCharm for bigger stuff just because its much easier to see all your files etc and it was free for students. 
If there are any such issues they are typically picked up by an automated unit test. If you are working on any code base aim to have some basic unit tests. I would recommend pytest. 
An IDE with autocomplete and unit tests.
import string import re chars = [] G = 0 T = 0 A = 0 C = 0 with open("genome.txt", "r") as f: for c in f.read(): chars.append(c) genome = open("genome.txt", "r") def check(x,y): pattern = (x+"\t"+y) z = 0 datafile = genome for line in datafile: if re.match(pattern,line): z += 1 print(z) check("A","A") gs = "G" ts = "T" a_s = "A" cs = "C" for c in chars: if c in gs: G += 1 if c in ts: T += 1 if a_s in c: A += 1 if c in cs: C += 1 print("") print("Gs... : " + str(G)) print("Ts... : " + str(T)) print("As... : " + str(A)) print("Cs... : " + str(C)) 
&gt; I'm used to getting errors when my code behaves in unexpected ways. But it didn't behave in an unexpected way.
You typically avoid pickle because of security reasons (arbitrary code execution), not cross-version compatibility. You can specify a pickle version with literally just an int parameter. It's a fantastic medium for storing your own data to be consumed by a local Python process later. It's pretty good for non-HTTP data serialization over the wire if you control both ends and trust the channel, but that's a weird use case. It's a terrible medium for sending or receiving data between different people. Even so, I prefer SQLite if only because you can interact with it the same way you interact with remote databases, and there aren't many things in my world that don't require interaction with some database somewhere.
There are some projects dealing with automated bytecode optimization in order to speed programs up. Furthermore you can write your own languages by generating python bytecode. Apart from that I don't know of any practical use.
I think you're looking for a pattern like r"(\w\t\w)". For testing your pattern and learning regex in general I can recommend pythex.org. 
Thanks I will be referring back to those
I don't normally recommend regex to beginner programmers, which based on this code OP is. [Some people when confronted with a problem think, "I know, I'll use regular expressions." Now they have two problems.](http://regex.info/blog/2006-09-15/247) You might want to take a look at /r/learnpython. This problem doesn't seem terribly complicated but I can't quite make out what you are doing, sorry.

&gt; You still need an \_\_init\_\_.py to import as a module, I don't understand. You can have a package that is just module.py and setup.py, and that can be installed and imported just fine.

Have you looked at what the guys over at pybee are doing? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XSeNQyPlTY
&gt;Out of interest, what's the advantages of using a command-line editor compared to a full blown IDE? Not OP but I use command-line editors pretty much exclusively out of habit. The vast majority of my development is for work, where everything is on remote headless Linux servers/VMs that require a jump or two over SSH to access. I've yet to find an IDE that can make one SSH hop, let alone two. Because of that, I'm pretty comfortable using VIM and can't really be arsed to change things up when I'm doing personal projects at home on my laptop.
The more code that already exists the more it makes sense to use a command line editor, it seems like to me
Like already mentioned the docker container and your local environment will need their packages installed separately. The ``Dockerfile`` is responsible for installing these requirements. I suggest making a ``requirements.txt`` file for your dependencies so you can quickly update them manually as well. Defining them in setup.py can also work. Also, in a docker container, you don't really need to use venv at all.
You can bundle your game as a module using setuptools and the windows embeddable python installation. That covers windows users. Distributing for Linux and Mac might be more difficult if the people aren't familiar with Python.
Just install a new version. It's not that hard. Download installer from python.org or use ``brew``. From a newbie perspective I can understand that running the ``python`` command by default runs 2.7.10 can be a problem. You actually have to use the ``python3`` command instead. There have been suggestions in the past making python3 the default version making python 2 available using ``python2``. That sounds even more confusing to me.
It all depends what kind of game your are making. There are lots of really neat packages for python. http://arcade.academy/ https://www.pygame.org https://bitbucket.org/pyglet/pyglet/wiki/Home http://python.cocos2d.org/ http://www.tilengine.org/ http://pymunk.org/ .. and lots more .. If you are going the high performance route you might want to look at https://github.com/cprogrammer1994/ModernGL, but remember that this is a rendering library and not a game engine.
VSCode is what I learned to code with, don't think I could ever go away. Though, I do want to check out JetBrains and their IDEs. I just can't fork over the money for it right now

Where else do you put utility functions? Having utils.py or helpers.py is making it very clear to me that these functions are non-specific. 
It didn't take me 7 years to add 340 card readers. The cards calculate things like area, volume, mass, area moments of inertia, and mass moments of inertia. That all feeds into mass properties and mass breakdowns of the global structure. Beams do not simply lines that connect two grid points. There's an orientation vector that defines the y/z axes of the say I-beam. The stiffness/mass axis of the may be offset from the grid points in the projected plane of the beam using one of 2 different methods (global or local projection). The nonstructural mass axis uses different offsets. When you're dealing with 3D shells (quads/tris), you need to worry about differential thicknesses on the nodes of the element and projected element coordinate systems. Isotropic shells don't simply have 1 material, they have 4 (axial, bending, tranverse shear, and membrane-bending), so you gotta pull the density from the right one (and which one you use varies depends on which ones you set). Most cards also have checks that when they don't pass lead to segfaults in Nastran or just assumed 0.0 values of say the load that don't exist, but are referenced (rather than an error).
Do you have any time to write documentation?
I'm asking for documentation because I don't know enought about the thing that I need documentation for. 
Well that does suck. Python is a contribution effort. The contributions come from individuals that have interest and expertise in the components they're contributing to. Tkinter just isn't that popular, do there aren't a lot of experts, and there isn't a lot of interest. If you really want to learn Tkinter, you need to learn Tk. Now, I wouldn't wish Tcl on my worst enemy, but that's the most direct way to learn it. Godspeed.
I'm not seeing the huge issue. Why would the documentation for this package change significantly between 2 and 3? Near as I can tell by comparing the [3.0 reference](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html) and the [2.7 reference](https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/tkinter.html) there have been few if any changes. Can you identify a feature present in Python tkinter 3.0 that's either different or non-existent in 2.7? Also, there's quite a lot of documentation in the source code. Try this: import tkinter tkinter.__file__ and open that file. &gt; I would like to request that Python Developers take the time to complete it, other wise how can I trust that they have completed the documentation of their other libraries? Can we see the documentation for your open source projects, please? 
If this is still open, I would be happy to get details. Sounds interesting and should be no problem to implement.

No way. I'm currently almost done with something very similar (expect it's specifically for downloading music and also writes metadata) and I'm also using pyqt. And my window icon is identical.
Your indents are wrong. Match all 4 spaces
Get rid of the space before `cost` on line 12 and remove the semicolon on line 9. Python does not terminate lines with semicolons. I highly recommend [PEP-8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).
In FEA, quad quality is really important. Things like small/large interior angles are bad. Angles greater than 180 degrees are really bad most codes can't catch them, but they're screw up your stiffness matrix, aspect ratio, taper ratio, warping (what you're talking about), etc. Quads are really, really easy though. It's the projected area and the area formula is exactly the method that FEA codes use (even for higher order elements). It converges for tiny elements, which is the whole idea behind FEA. a = xyz3 - xyz1 b = xyz4 - xyz2 area = 0.5 * np.linalg.norm(a, b)

Glad you got something from it. Never hurts to read twice. 
&gt; I can't be the only programmer who makes typos and errors like this. How are these kinds of stupid little mistakes avoided by professionals? Testing.
Whats a good example of why to use them? I see basic examples and I'm like "Whats the point?" I think I need a real-world example for me to get it.
They’re more for convenience then necessity. Hold up, gimme a sec and I’ll show u.
What? Explain if you'd like, but I think I'm going to ignore it haha It seems to me that parens in an if statement allow you express explicit order of operations and readability? 
[Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.12/patterns/viewdecorators/) may be a useful example
io.open()
Okay, I'll start by showing you this decorator that allows you to try a function upto X times if an exception is thrown. So basically a retry function. &amp;#x200B; Look \[here\]([https://github.com/MoHKale/MangaGrabber/blob/master/mangagrabber/GLOBAL/decorators.py](https://github.com/MoHKale/MangaGrabber/blob/master/mangagrabber/GLOBAL/decorators.py)) for the try\_x\_times decorator and \[here\]([https://github.com/MoHKale/MangaGrabber/blob/master/mangagrabber/templates/grabber.py](https://github.com/MoHKale/MangaGrabber/blob/master/mangagrabber/templates/grabber.py)) for where I've actually used it in a make\_request method. &amp;#x200B; Now in truth, there's no need for a decorator here; however notice adding retry functionality to the make\_request method doesn't relate to what make\_request should actually do. Call me old fashioned, but a method shouldn't try to be more then what it is. A make\_request method should make and return a request; that said, simply wrapping this functionality over an existing method to give it \*extra!!! :)\* features doesn't violate my rules &amp; allows me to easily remove it if at some point I no longer desire it. &amp;#x200B; Check \[here\]([https://github.com/MoHKale/MangaGrabber/blob/master/mangagrabber/sites/kissmanga/grabber.py](https://github.com/MoHKale/MangaGrabber/blob/master/mangagrabber/sites/kissmanga/grabber.py)) for something similar. I've wrapped the entry into some methods with my logger so instead of every time I want to log entry by adding a little section before the actual method to log the method name &amp; all the parameters passed to it &amp; some code at the end which logs the value being returned from it, I can simply add a little decorator and trust all that precious info is conveniently being recorded. &amp;#x200B; For a more meaningless example, check the cast\_return decorator statements. All this does is pass the return value of the method to the constructor of the argument.

Which one is pythonic?
bytecode preserves more information about the original code, so you can sometimes do more interesting transformations, modifications, or analyses with bytecode than you can do with assembly code.
It sounds like you're coming from a statically-typed language where every class has a fixed set of fields and instances of it contain all of those fields and only those fields. In that case, [slots](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#slots) are a good way to enforce similar behavior at runtime (rather than just detecting it at lint-time). class FunnelSlice: __slots__ = ('interviews_scheduled',) # a tuple of strings; only these attributes will be allowed fs = FunnelSlice() fs.scheduled_interviews = [] # Interact with the attribute as normal fs.scheduled_interview = [] # Raises AttributeError This will most likely be more effective than a linter- or IDE-based solution when the tooling can't determine that the object you're interacting with is a FunnelSlice. def schedule(fs, *interviews): fs.scheduled_interview = list(interviews) # If your linter can catch this, it may be telepathic However, slots are stil Python attributes, with all their possibly-unexpected behavior. fs = FunnelSlice() print(fs.scheduled_interviews) # Raises AttributeError; there is no "default value initialization" fs.scheduled_interviews = [] # This should happen in __init__ print(fs.scheduled_interviews) # Now this is OK del fs.scheduled_interviews # This is also OK print(fs.scheduled_interviews) # And now this is an AttributeError again Slots also interact strangely with inheritance. class Unslotted: pass # Any attributes are OK class Slotted1: __slots__ = ('foo1', 'foo2') # Only these attributes are OK class Slotted2(Slotted1): __slots__ = ('bar1', 'bar2') # 'foo1', 'foo2', 'bar1', and 'bar2' are OK class EmptySlots(Slotted1): __slots__ = () # 'foo1' and 'foo2' are OK class SlottedChild(Unslotted): __slots__ = ('child1', 'child2') # Any attributes are OK - __dict__ is inherited class DictSlotted: __slots__ = ('dicted1', 'dicted2', '__dict__',) # Any attributes are OK, but vars(obj) won't include dicted1 or dicted2
Thanks :)
Don't need to, just download the community edition! I use it and it rocks.
Well python users are pretty accustomed to using decorators; it’s an intrinsic part of OOP beaches of static &amp; class methods. However I heavily suggest learning to create your own decorators, it’ll deepen your understanding of python as a whole and make certain problems which I would regularly see as a pain to implement or adapt to an existing infrastructure, feel like a breeze. Anyways, good luck. Edit: also, yeah, check out flask. I don’t use it (django man myself) but I’ve seen the documentation and it really goes crazy with making decorators essential to the development process.
If they are needed for order of operations then obviously you need them of it won’t function correctly.
It’s just standard to omit the outer parenthesis. I.e. if x == 5 instead of if (x == 5)
If there are multiple operations parens are fine, but in a singular if statement they are not necessary. The code in the post works, but is not pythonic and would not pass my (and many others) code review in a professional setting. Ignore if you want, but I would advise against that :)
It seems like it's doable. You need to know the version and when certain arguments/methods were deprecated. While you're at it, it seems like you'd be able to determine what version of say numpy you require. That'd be awesome.
[This](http://effbot.org/tkinterbook/wm.htm) may be what you're looking for.
&gt; Edit: this only happens when downloading a stream with no audio codec. it likely leverages youtube-dl as a back end. If you are not familiar with the project check it out. 
Any language today works this way. If you dont want to program using another people code learn pure C and write all from scratch. 
Either by having them download an .exe or by using JS I guess &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
Great question! You probably want to use something like AWS. You can batch Elastic Transcoder jobs using AWS Lambda functions (which can be written in Python). It will be a lot simpler and more maintainable than rolling your own system. I previously had my own solution with FFMPEG and a shell script. But, performance became an issue because it would take minutes to compress the video. As for the second portion, trying to do expensive video operations on the client side is *not* a good idea because it will be very complex and slow.
I think that's just a result of the bias in what tutorials you watched, rather than a general statement about Python. Somebody who only learned the core language from sources that didn't mention third party stuff would conclude, "Python is just a bare bones langauge, and nobody ever talks about a broader ecosystem."
Python 3 can.
Your answer seems to have elicited a variety of responses that may be confusing. You may like to read about properties in python which addresses your specific case of what pythonic attribute access looks like, and by convention you will make few of those kinds of mistakes over time. While an IDE will help out I think you're really asking about whether you need an IDE to develop in python and I don't think you do. As an interpreted language you should have a greater emphasis on constantly running your code, using unit tests or just a debugger for small scripts (pdb to start with). Liberal use of asserts are favoured by some. Nosier/pytestwatch are good for continuous execution. 
That is a result of the tutorials you chose to watch. Try reading Think Like a Computer Scientist. That being said, programming often *is* gluing a lot of packages together.
&gt; it would be cool to see someone do something along the lines of using emscripten to compile ffmpeg to WASM and distribute that to the clients... No, stop giving them ideas. Web dev is already polluted enough.
I've started removing six from my code in places (not entirely). It still works and is tested in python 2/3. I actively look for new features in numpy, scipy, and matplotlib to take advantage of. It's really hard to find, even going back years. For companies who haven't upgraded (python 2/3 or numpy or whatever) yet, making the case is tricky without some new feature is hard.
Yeah, AWS is probably going to be my go to as danny suggested. I never heard of emscripten or WASM... very interesting, I'll look into that, appreciate it.
The didn't copy matlab. They made a 3rd interface that looks like matlab. I don't use it. The API that most people use is not the real API. If you want to plot in real time, you have to dive into the real API.
Reminds me of that graph about self awareness and programming skill. For python, decorators made me think I was a programming god, when my code improved much more when I started to write more complete test suites
Doesn't seaborn uses matplotlib? If you can do it there, you can do it in matplotlib.
It doesn't support numpy, so I don't do it that way. If it's list/tuple only sure, but force of habit.
No...just, no. The packages are written in Python. Obviously for that to work there has to be a language at the bottom. You watched so e crappy tutorials.
Alternatively, you could queue them up for processing and update the browser when done. This way you won't overload the CPU by doing too much, but it will take longer for the queue to drain. So you async update the browser with the results. It doesn't scale well on one machine, you'll eventually have to scale horizontally to handle more video, but this could be a stop gap while $$ is tight 
You should ask questions like this in /r/learnpython. When posting there you should [format your code for reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/faq#wiki_how_do_i_format_code.3F).
Definitely don't use file objects directly -- 99% of the time, for anyone who finds this article useful, instead use: ``` with open(file, mode) as f: f.read() f.write(stuff) ``` ...which will *automatically* close/cleanup the file object, even if an exception happens.
The problem is in the conditional: if UCI == "Chrome" or "chrome": You'll need to check if UCI equals each value. For example: if UCI == "Chrome" or UCI == "chrome": Same with if UCI == "Clock" or "Time" or "clock" or "time": It will have to be: if UCI == "Clock" or UCI == "Time" or UCI == "clock" or UCI == "time":
I use decorators to do quick-n-dirty profiling sometimes: from functools import wraps def timeit(fn): @wraps(fn) def wrapper(*args, **kwargs): start_time = time.clock() result = fn(*args, **kwargs) log.debug('%s took %f seconds', fn.__name__, time.clock() - start_time) return wrapper @timeit def expensive_function(): ... 
Thank you very much, it works now
Fair enough. That's what I've been using, and I know it's good as long as the element is good, but it felt unsatisfying that the area could be very wrong for bad elements. As to the previous point, I don't think what I said earlier applies because I was under the mistaken impression was that you were representing cards in a bdf, rather than doing fea pre-processing.
Multiprocessing can’t do anything at the dataframe level if the output of row 1 is the input of row 2. You’ll want to look into parallelizing the task of processing of each individual row if you want any performance gains.
Track suit andy?
A more succinct way of accomplishing the same thing is using str.lower, e.g. the following for the first one: if UCI.lower() == ‘chrome’: 
Is there any good tutorial on being pythonic? I see a lot of criticisms of people's code and that it doesn't conform to the pep8 or it is not simplified. What does that mean and how do I write code to conform? 
Look into flask and have your website link to a flask site. 
What does the data set consist of? What’s the goal of the project? 
Put your script in Amazon Lambda. Write some PHP (or some JavaScript) that sends the pictures to it.
I interview lots of python engineers. Things I like to see. - You can put a python application out on the internet. Heroku is meh to me. I want to see ansible, docker, aws lambda, nginx/uwsgi/gunicorn, etc. Stuff that shows you hav devops chops - You've made PRs to python projects. Literally anything. - You know how to outsource functionality to 3rd party providers like Sentry (logging) and Sendgrid (email).
First step is to read PEP8. PEP are formal documents proposing changes to the Python language. PEP8 is a really early one that defines basic code style conventions, for readability and consistency between different programmers. Available here:https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/ PEP20 defines the principles of pythonicity. It's abstract, more of a manifesto, so you'll want to learn from examples. https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/ I'm on mobile so I'm not in the best position to find additional resources, but I'd encourage you to Google it a bit to get a sense for practical "pythonic" code, and note that either way you'll refine your idea of what is clean code over time, by reading (stack overflow, blogs, other people's code, etc.) and working on your own projects. Also keep in mind that a lot of what's pythonic works in python, not necessarily all programming languages, and even in python maybe some contexts might need to move away from that. You wouldn't "ask for forgiveness, not for permission" in Java, for example, because the performance hit of raising exceptions is considered too high in Java. 
Hi there, from the /r/Python mods. We have removed this post as it is not suited to the /r/Python subreddit proper, however it should be very appropriate for our sister subreddit /r/LearnPython or for the r/Python discord: https://discord.gg/3Abzge7. The reason for the removal is that /r/Python is dedicated to discussion of Python news, projects, uses and debates. It is not designed to act as Q&amp;A or FAQ board. The regular community is not a fan of "how do I..." questions, so you will not get the best responses over here. On /r/LearnPython the community and the r/Python discord are actively expecting questions and are looking to help. You can expect far more understanding, encouraging and insightful responses over there. **No matter what level of question you have, if you are looking for help with Python, you should get good answers**. Make sure to check out the rules for both places. Warm regards, and best of luck with your Pythoneering!
Sure, it's unlikely I'd stop using dicts as they're so convenient, but I'm still interested in knowing the answer. I hardly ever use tuples.
Good bot. 
For an entry-level position most projects involving a nontrivial backend are interesting for me. Heroku is fine for me and I don’t care much about open source contributions. Just a couple of projects that you’ve worked on that you find interesting and that you’re ready to talk about.
What if you are scared?
A full blown IDE can be great out of the box, so there's nothing wrong with those. They're built for development, so you can't go wrong using a real IDE over the command line. But a command line editor like vim, you can add tons of plugins to make it an IDE. There's tons of great, free plugins that have been around for a while and are solid. There's [vim python-mode](https://github.com/python-mode/python-mode). You can get all the IDE stuff, refactoring tools, code completion, documentation referencing, everything really if you look around. They CAN be IDEs even though they don't start as one. It's partly out of habit of being so used to them, partly because I can ssh into any box and work in it like normal if I need to, and partly just because I like that I can pretty much stay in the terminal and browser all day and I don't need any other apps open. You can get Vim bindings for most IDEs, but I just like the pure terminal experience with all the plugins I choose. My vim will pylint on write and give me a list of my linting errors, which is most of what I want out of a python IDE at this point. Been doing python professionally for years now, and I turn off autocomplete at this point because it's more distracting than not. I know 99% of what I need out of the standard library and the third party libraries I use, and if it's a new one I check out the docs on the side and reference the library source to fully understand them. I don't really want code completion for it anymore so even though I can have it with my plugins, I turn it off. Most other languages though, I like having real code completion. If I was going to do C++ I'd probably use VS Code or Jetbrains' CLion. If I was going to do Java, I *need* eclipse and code completion. But day to day it's mostly shell scripts and python which I'm fine 100% with basic vim, and then some javascript which I unfortunately do from Vim even though I'd probably benefit from a good IDE, just never really found a good one. Plus javascript is hard as hell to test without looking at it from the browser and seeing the DOM change and all that.
I learned in nano, began to prefer vim, then found VS Code wit PyLint. Haven't gone back.

Without going into detail, it's COBOL and mainframe based being migrated to Unix, Informatica side. So wide across most conventional text editors can't read records as single lines and instead wrap around to the next line. 
You're forgetting size of Bar? And maybe check if it's not just the default methods, by how it scales with more data. 
I can upload it to a public GitHub project or something but I'm not sure dealing with flexible display size is my top priority at this point. I don't even know what the language can or can't do right now. :p

I think parentheses make this example easier for beginners: &gt;\&gt;\&gt;\&gt; bool(0 in [1, 2] or [3, 4]) &gt;True &gt;\&gt;\&gt;\&gt; bool((0 in [1, 2]) or ([3, 4])) &gt;True For beginners: The right side of the 'or' is a nonempty list, and a nonempty list resolves to True, which means that the 'or' resolves to True. &gt;\&gt;\&gt;\&gt; bool((0 in [1, 2]) or ([])) &gt;False
I had a script running on the webserver watching for new videos. It would ship them to a transcoding cluster and the cluster shipped them back when they were finished.
I think this is the right answer. Theres no way a dict is smaller than a dict + the object wrapper (since properties are in a dict anyway).
If anyone knows,it'd be really appreciated!!!
I mean think about it, does it even make sense to you that a reference-counted polymorphic object containing 2 arbitrary precision ints and one 3 byte string to have a total size of 54 bytes? Clearly that information is not accurate. Ignore aliasing. A string by itself would need 27 bytes (3 byte data, start, end, real end). An arbitrary prec int is essentially a vector of ints so lets say 28 bytes each (an int, start, end, real end). Now all these objects will have a reference counter and string will point to a vtable (since it's polymophic). We get a total of 103 bytes. This is ignoring your own object (containing a hash map mapping string to these objects), its reference counter, and vtable pointer. I totally ignored vtable size too.
Ah right okay, good to hear. I guess one thing is you can access it from any computer, like the 'IDE' won't need any extra software on the client.
In my experience, bad quad warping is rare. I find quads with internal angles greater than 180 degrees far more common. &gt; cards in a bdf, rather than doing fea pre-processing. It does it all. You can debug an uttery broken deck because the reader takes advantage of the type system to speed up casting. You can disable post read validation (e.g., my node ids aren't the same). You can reject cards you don't care about to speed things up. You can programmatically build a model using `add_x` methods that are easier to use work with. You can read/write to/from a StringIO because it's faster. You can get element quality metrics (including one I made up, which I think is a better taper ratio), sum mass/loads on a single load id/combination for all elements or a subset. You can parse a 2 GB OP2 result file in ~4 seconds. That includes matrices, almost every result type you can think of (maybe not so much with p-elements or vu-elements). You can also pull the geometry from the output file (it's much faster and far more correct). There's certainly a lot of stuff missing (e.g., stress transforms, new MSC/NX tables, ~1/2 the cards), but that makes it giant. Adding 350 new cards isn't really going to add a ton of new capability. I'm sure the average user only knows 70 cards tops. When you've gotten to the EPOINT and ROTORG cards, you've got the important ones.
You enter that command into a regular terminal (cmd.exe), not a python interpreter.
Yes, but what version of python 3? `import sys; print(sys.version)`
After the Advent of captainduckduck, dockku etc. Nginx and docker are not really an issue. (They automate most of the problems and headaches coupled with building a full deployment pipeline)
Wow that’s pretty cool why don’t we add your feature to our project and make it a big one what you think join our slack chat 
pip3 needs to be in your PATH. Google “Windows path environment variable” and add the path where you installed python. Pip is usually in there. If not you’ll have to install pip too by google get-pip and download get-pip.py and run “python get-pip.py” to install pip. 
Alright, thanks for the help! At least I know where to start now.
thank you, for this. I already figured it out after the earlier poster directed me to start with a regular terminal. I just needed to start searching how to get the regular terminal to work. However, I really appreciate the help!

Really surprised that the slicing section didn't even mention slice objects...
import pyautogui
Thanks! Definitely looking into that asap tomorrow.
I would look into pyautogui, Al Schweinfurt has some examples on youtube
Coincidentally, this problem sort of solves itself. [Fabrice Bellard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fabrice\_Bellard) worked on both ffmpeg and [jslinux](https://bellard.org/jslinux/), which has resulted in a ton of "legacy" C code being ported directly to Javascript. So your question isn't silly at all. You can run ffmpeg in the browser.
When I started programming, I too had the same problem. When and where in your learning process are you expected to learn that? When I learned python and wanted to install some libraries, all tutorials just said "Just pip install x"
Context managers are one of the best features of Python. I would certainly consider them a top 10 need-to-know item. 
Anything you want to run on the client's machine will have to be supported by their browser. Major browsers only support Javascript as a scripting language, not Python3. Furthermore, even using Javascript, you can't call on an external executable. Absolutely not. So using a standard build of FFmpeg is pretty much off the table, no matter what you try. Where does that leave you? You would need an implementation of FFmpeg (or another transcoding software) written in Javascript. [Such a thing does exist](https://bgrins.github.io/videoconverter.js/), because of course it does. You could have a website that would serve that Javascript code in the page and use it to process videos locally. However, this is not a well-maintained, high-performance port of FFmpeg to Javascript; it seems to be more of an emulation by transpiling LLVM code to Javascript. I don't know a lot about this process, but I have a hunch that means the Javascript version will be excruciatingly slow. Probably unusable. So, in the end: yes you can do this, but you probably shouldn't. Of course, the much better alternative, as many other people have suggested, is to rent some processing power in the cloud to offload your transcoding. But I thought it would be nice to provide a thorough answer for the question you actually asked, too. 
please post more links
I've been using Tkinter for over a year now and I have had no trouble doing whatever I want to with it, and the things I haven't done there are youtube videos on anyway.
I haven't played space unicorn, but I'm guessing my game is not as interesting given that it takes 2 minutes to play so far and also in Norwegian...
Okidoke!
For context, while this might work it would be hilariously slow. Also you would probably need to patch things to support file I/O via some kind of server API. 
Another way would be to move all the video processing to the client side with something like this: [ffmpeg.js.wasm](https://github.com/BrianJFeldman/ffmpeg.js.wasm) This is a porting of ffmpeg into webassembly js, which means all the computation would be performed on the client's CPU. &amp;#x200B;
What I ended up doing was creating the venv in docker and populating it manually from the inside. Once everything was fixed, I changed the setup.py and will install it normally next time, without the venv. I'm updating devpi versions of some dependencies before we do that though.
Yep, although I was bitten once for doing that and caused an incident. If you are using werkzeug with uWSGI and are passing file object directly (i.e sending file to the user) you should not use context managers. Apparently file sending happens after the function exits. If you are confused about the above, just ignore it, you pretty much always should use context managers.

Yes you can! Let's see if I can find the repository. [https://github.com/colek42/streamingDemo](https://github.com/colek42/streamingDemo) This guy transformed ffmpeg into js and uses it in the browser to decode mpeg packets sent by the server over websockets (takes breath) &amp;#x200B; It's not exactly what you're looking for, perhaps some of the other bindings will work?
Thanks for that. Quite helpful. Are PRs really that important? Is it for code quality? What if you have contributed only to inhouse softwares and projects.
The problem is people putting everything in these (I have seen recommendation on how to structure apps where people suggest this as a design, to avoid putting everything in Django's views - in my opinion its just as bad if not worse). Helpers.py isn't moderating anything real. The reason for object oriented programming is to keep related data and functionality together. Fair enough if your functionality is non specific and doesn't actually go with any specific data, put it in utils.py, but I don't think that is the case very often. What do you think seems a more natural way to uppercase a string: import StringuUtils StringUtils.upper(my_string) or mystring.upper() 
It is terribly expensive... It's about $2 per hour of transcoded output. That's a terrible deal. If you're using your own hardware look at making use of Intel Quicksync for really fast hardware offloaded transcoding. AMD and Nvidia also have offerings. Your CPU will barely get touched whilst transcoding if you offload to Quicksync or Nvenc or whatever AMD's thing is. NB: Quicksync will not be available on server grade Intel processors so you won't be able to make use of it on any VPS. Make use of a GPU capable VPS. Most providers will have a GPU equipped box typically with a Quadro card. For $0.5/hr you can get 8 CPU cores, 30GB ram, and Quadro P4000 from Paperspace. That system will transcode much more than 1hr of HD content in an hour. You'll be getting about 2400 frames per second @ HD resolution with two simultaneous streams encoding h264. Just know that storing and streaming video is expensive. Storage space and bandwidth can hurt if you're serving up a lot. In that case I would recommend you take the performance knock and transcode to vp9 and h264. Most newer devices will do vp9. Vp9 has a slower encode time (about twice as long as h264) but you'll be able to reduce file size by about 40-60%. Itll also work on about 70% of browsers on the web. That's a whole lot of bandwidth saving if you serve a lot. Stay away from h265 for now as the vast majority of browsers don't yet support it although it even beats VP9 by a good marginwithout the same encode hit. By the way, Amazon does offer many advantages. You only pay for what you use so no paying for unused capacity - might save you money overall. Scaling with Amazon is also going to be many orders of magnitude easier. Overall work flow is very easy. I have used the Amazon service in quite a few projects where I could have gotten away cheaper by doing my own thing because of ease of use, scalability and because it integrates so nicely with their other products. 
- pep8 - you got the wrong abstraction. People using it should not have to deal with params, query terms, http response. You need to have an abstraction on top of it that hides the implementation details. People shouldn't have to deal with all of that when using it, it should return objects instead of the raw dict. - tests? - reduce the number of method calls the user has to make even for the most basic usage (minimum 3 method calls?) But it is stil a good nice try.

Although that takes the load off the server, it puts the cost on you, not the client, so I'm not sure if that's what OP is asking for.
&gt; You have to use a lot of servers on something like AWS. Could you explain further what you mean by that? You can use as many servers as you need, or with lambda or Fargate, none. I'm not sure how that's relevant anyway. 
The downside of that is that transcoding puts a big load on a system, and that's really not something you should be dumping onto your users unless they're clearly informed of what's going to happen. As a user, I'd never consent to allowing a big chunk of costly code from a third party to run on my machine. 
I do not like the first list comprehension example. Better style would be `list = list(range(2,16,2))` in python 3.x or `list = range(2,16,2)` in python 2.7. List comprehension is just not necessary here.
&gt; Is there a way to harness a user's own CPU to execute FFMPEG? Implement your software as a desktop application. Don't even think about embedding a whole web browser in it.
You need to install this module first.
It''s a pretty interesting idea, that may be possible these days. See if anyone has compiled ffmpeg / libav (an ffmpeg fork) or gstreamer using llvm to run in the browser.
Good feedback, could be presented a bit less negative.
But the sane thing to do would be use celery on the server to run the tasks. &amp;#x200B; You could probably do some work to make the video pipeline use less CPU. &amp;#x200B; If you need to only have a certain part of the video uploaded it might use less resources to cut the video first, and then run something to scale the output before processing it. &amp;#x200B; Gstreamer might be worth experimenting with, you want to try and make all your video processing work in hardware too.
True that, but at the same time you remove a lot of web traffic. As a user that do not have fast internet connection I prefer webapps that use my computer instead my connection. &amp;#x200B; It really depends on how heavy is the processing
Google the phrase "semver" to understand how Python version numbers work. 
I guess I just got tired of people spamming their beginner projects everywhere and taking up all the good names on pypi. Pypi is getting more and more like npm with each such project uploaded there.
if your interested in looking at other shortcuts, the newest version of Python has a thing called "dataclasses" to do this. Its a lightweight class designed to replace a datastore namedtuple or dict. You can also try the attrs library.
Two options: 1) Target the browser by having the app generate html. If you go deep into this and want a proper solution, google for "interactive fiction" community and the twine program at twinery.org. 2) Use a socket and build a mud (multi user dungeon).
What is you background? If you know to program just start using it, look for guides specific to your background - there are lots for "Python for \[whatever\] programmers" articles in the net. Also ask more specific questions! and this: [https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/)
hahaha sorry i just literally need to find a way to get excited/enjoy coding. Never coded before, need it for processing astronomical data
Use keyboard and mouse modules 
You'll get better help asking on r/learnpython. 
Doing a search for "python astronomy" gets a ton of hits. Here's a few (in no particular order): * [https://python4astronomers.github.io/](https://python4astronomers.github.io/) * [http://www.astropy.org/](http://www.astropy.org/) * [http://www.astropython.org/](http://www.astropython.org/) * [https://pypi.org/search/?q=astronomy](https://pypi.org/search/?q=astronomy) &gt; Its new to me, i dont like it That may be due to, if I may assume, your limited experience with computing. You may not realize just how much easier scientific computing is with python, compared with Fortran or C. It easier to write python because there's less fiddling with incidental things, so you get a working program sooner. The tradeoff is that python can be slower than Fortran or C. There are also a lot of existing packages and modules that help you with general things (eg, numpy, hdf5, etc) as well as astronomy-specific modules that others have written. Hang in there, you will quickly grow to love python.
There's a talk I often link to by Raymond Hettinger, one of the core devs, titled ["Beyond PEP 8 -- Best practices for beautiful intelligible code"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf-BqAjZb8M). I'd highly suggest watching it after having read the actual PEPs outlined in /u/Laogeodritt's comment. Actually, just watch a bunch of his talks, like ["Transforming Code into Beautiful, Idiomatic Python"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSGv2VnC0go) (perhaps even this one first). The man is a goldmine of informative content that is very well presented.
yea i 100 percent agree with how useful it is, i am just struggling to find passion within the coding itself!
i do, but would like to also acquire a strong like for the act of coding itself
&gt;SemVer Thanks! I didn't know there was a formal way of versioning. I thought it was at the whims of developers.

When you write some python for astronomy, also write the same thing in C, Fortran or another common astronomy language. That painful experience may convince you! I wrote a lot of python for geophysical applications after many years of using C, and it was so much easier in python. Keep writing python, it will grow on you.
Thanks :)
Sure, in the following link you can see how the BTCEUR price is taken: https://gist.github.com/agentphantom/117fb1973116807240f5e25410211800 Bitfinex has really bad Websocket APIs, for this script I used the REST API and polled it every 2.25 seconds.
This is more of a getting started with programming issue, less a Python thing. Python is the most straightforward language to start with though. I love Python and how quickly I can solve problems with it. I use it for all sorts of tasks, and it never lets me down. I'm not sure how far along you are, so this may be too basic, but install IPython first thing as your REPL and find out how to use a debugger. For reasons unknown to me, nobody says that a good REPL and debugger massively speeds up your learning process. 
I still think /r/learnpython is more suitable for posts like this rather than /r/python . I'll try to be nicer in the future, I really appreciate your feedback!
Here's a sneak peek of /r/learnpython using the [top posts](https://np.reddit.com/r/learnpython/top/?sort=top&amp;t=year) of the year! \#1: [My new book, "Cracking Codes with Python" is now available and free to read online!](https://np.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/7sigre/my_new_book_cracking_codes_with_python_is_now/) \#2: [I'm releasing a free code for the "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python" Udemy course](https://np.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/7fxork/im_releasing_a_free_code_for_the_automate_the/) \#3: [I made a python cheat sheet](https://np.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/82t191/i_made_a_python_cheat_sheet/) ---- ^^I'm ^^a ^^bot, ^^beep ^^boop ^^| ^^Downvote ^^to ^^remove ^^| [^^Contact ^^me](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=sneakpeekbot) ^^| [^^Info](https://np.reddit.com/r/sneakpeekbot/) ^^| [^^Opt-out](https://np.reddit.com/r/sneakpeekbot/comments/8wfgsm/blacklist/)

I appreciate the feedback. I didn’t think it was unfriendly. I’ll start thinking of how to add another abstraction layer. I did post this initially on r/learnpython but was promptly told that the sub was just for questions. I wasn’t sure where else to post it. I was just really excited to show someone my work.

It is. It's pyNastran. I'm totally fine with pull requests. Just, don't change all the imports :)
WebAssembly might be one option.
Not bad to be the first package. A few simple things: * Might be a good idea to pin your dependencies at least to a major version. In the future, requests might not have the same interface * ``nsf = FundNSF()`` sometimes hint that things could be simplified. Maybe the initializer can also take some of the configuration arguments? * Proper code formatting in ``README.md`` in general ```py from fundNSF import FundNSF nsf = FundNSF( nsf.set_fields(abstractText=True) nsf.set_params(dateStart='01/01/2017', dateEnd='12/31/2017') # enter date as 'mm/dd/yyyy' ``` * Share parts of the output of ``print(award_data['abstractText'])`` as this is important to give the user an impression what your package is doing. * Instead of ``get_`` and ``set_`` methods, consider using ``@property`` instead. ```py @property def fields(self): return self._fields @fields.setter def fields(self, **kwargs): ... ``` 
you need first install the module pip install easygui then import easygui \*
You could use an off statement which checks if the character is a space or a digit. If it is, i -= 1
without knowing any specifics (such as how large the file is) and not knowing exactly the behavior of how werkzeug handles closing the file (if it does), you may be better off doing with open(...) as f: data = f.read() return data 
``` def f(function, iterable): return list(filter(function, iterable)) ```

Thanks. This is great feedback. 
You also asking for a system that is able to interpret the screen, so you need to include some computer vision algorithm. Python and C++ have a library called OpenCV which could help you.
This will sound silly, but randomize an AI for easy-fun of coding. I had a chat-bot for administrative stuff and one day I decided to code the simplest AI like "bot, are you there?" with possible answers to the "what" keyword as ["Yes", "No", "Maybe", "I don't know"]. Eventually this lead me to add more than 500 answers to When, what, how, when, who and more keywords. As the answers was always random, sometimes I was asking stuff like "Bot, what are you doing?" and it would reply "Stop asking and go to work, asshole". It's really silly, but it made me laugh because I made it so complex in the end that I couldn't predict what it would answer... and guess what? When I realized about it, I learnt a lot about coding and had fun with it!

You could specify that it's a python 3 project in ``README.md``. I see you added python 3 in to package classifiers. **thumbs up**
editing. Its just a fancy and quick way of editing data stored in text files.
Couple of more things: * Make a new release in your project every time you push your package to pipy with a general change log : https://github.com/C-NoBlok/fundNSF/releases * Optionally you can also make a ``CHANGELOG.md`` file * With open source projects it's in my opinion important to make a clean commit history. Be as explicit as possible in your commit titles. Try to avoid many small commits in a small period of time changing the same file. This is one of the first thing I look at in projects. Neat commit history increases confidence in the project and encourage potential contributors. 
that is commonly known. unfortunately it doesn't work in my case.
interesting, I'll have to check it out. my problem has been otsu works sometimes but not others. adaptive thresholding works sometimes and not others. so I'll give this a go.
How would you recommend saving trained models?
More simply, pickled file = executable file. The dangers aren’t really relevant here since it’s about saving and loading your own model objects. Don’t go downloading and loading random pickle files, the same way you wouldn’t run random executables. There’s nothing inherently dangerous about the tool itself.
Some of the requirements for backend engineers are: \- Write awesome Python \- Optimize performance of core backend when dealing with extensive operations over massive sets of binary data \- Collaborate with security research staff to design and implement the infrastructure for the deployment of host-based defense software for black-box embedded devices \- Streamline distribution of core product libraries and software toolkit \- Design and develop large-scale automated test farm \- Secure all the things \- Database creation, integration, and management \- Cloud computing integration. I also find Heroku very useful for this case. &amp;#x200B; Good luck!
That's a really great write up. 
lol
That's a syntax change and would require a much more detailed specification, in the form of a PEP.
i don't think so but my english is really not good for posting a PEP.
It will absolutely require a PEP, and you will need to write one, or find someone to write one.
Hi, Looking at that reference UI, it definitely doesn't look "native" My normal suggestion for UI projects is Qt via pyside2. But for commercial usage, you need a more permissive license, plus you want a more custom ui. Qt licensing is pricy. I reccomend Kivy as a result. You'll be able to make a customized UI and it's MIT licensed. 
Thank you ill look into kivy i appreciate it!
And what happens if you have multiple clauses with `2:`? Or what if you have `1:` and `2:`? Do both run?
The original approach is more efficient, because unlike your example it doesn't copy the data in memory and also uses little of memory. Instead it invokes sendfile() syscall which makes kernel do all that work (it just pipes the file directly to the socket). The issue though is that uWSGI invokes sendfile() after the function exits instead during the call.
This structure looks a lot like a switch statement with an extra layer of iteration. The switch statement has been argued over a lot for Python so if that doesn't get in, I highly doubt this will.
there is no tab in reddit ,so sorry about that
huh just like if if 1 in foo: foo.remove(1) if 1 in foo: print('huh') &amp;#x200B; really idk
Thanks for the tips. I’m also new to using git and I my messy commit history was due to me playin g around a lot. I’ll keep it cleaner moving forward. 
And that's why you need to write up a PEP detailing all of those things.
thanks, i will that i will try to rewrite it with all something like this thanks 
No, but there are spaces, which you can type 4 of, which is what you should be doing in python code anyway.
hence my qualification "99% of the time for anyone who finds this article useful" :) it's definitely true that if you're writing a multi-layered program and the file object *itself* is being passed around, you probably can't use something as clean as context managers
Thanks for all comment, i will rewrite this in minte :P
There are lots of folders on a computer. If the computer had to look through every folder for a program every time you typed something into the command line, it would take forever. If all the programs were stored in one place, it would be a pain for a human to find them. The solution to this problem is for a computer and its user to maintain a list of directories in which the computer should look for commands, in order. This is called the PATH variable. You can add your python installation directory to the PATH variable as /u/Gprime5 has said.
Keras uses h5py.
You wouldn't download a car; you wouldn't download a pickle.

In pycharm you can add a run configuration that goes through SSH (I think, never used the feature though). When I'm developing a program for headless machine then I generally will just git push on my side and git pull on the other. The benefits of using an IDE far outweigh the time to push and pull to/from a repo.
If your a student (or have access to a university email), you can sign up for the Pro edition for free. If they don't have your school they even have github repo where you can make a PR to add it. All that being said, the community edition is still a great choice if you don't want to go through all the work.
Just to check if I understand you correctly. This: match([1,2,3]): if 1: print(„abc“) if 4: print(„def“) And this: for x in [1,2,3]: if x == 1: print(„abc“) if x == 4: print(„def“) Would output the same, wouldn’t they?

I've heard people suggest using Arcade: http://arcade.academy/ https://github.com/pvcraven/arcade It does seem to be more modern and maintained, but I haven't touched it.
&gt; Keras uses h5py. H5PY just providers the interface to the HDF5 file format. You will obviously need to write your own serializer/deserializer for your data.
Obviously, beauty is in the eye of the beholder. What's hard for someone, might not be hard for someone else. I was just asking for a personal, though biased, view on things, maybe from programmers versed in several languages. :) I just had a look the the /r/learnpython subreddit, thanks and also thanks, @mudclub! I'll start there.
Yes - definitely go there. Learning enough python to get work isn't hard. Learning enough to get a job at Google is a far greater challenge.
I dabbled with it back in the 2.5 days and very much unlike ia32 it's far too unstable across versions to build on frankly. The Hy guys made the same call and switched to the much more stable and forward compatible approach of ast generation and manipulation. It's not really meant to be extremely fast, nor is cpython in general, it's just a simpler means of building and maintaining an interpreter. My only use for it these days are for changing the language in very fundamental, low level means without having to modify (or even have access to) the relevant ast nodes (specifically things like caching class definitions inside functions by rewriting the callsites). It's still obviously important to know about if you hack on the interpreter though.
That’s just industry shit, they are all drones and follow what every other company is doing. Just practice interview question. I started at projecteuler.com
Don't give up! All interviews are *not* like this. I don't want to work at a company where the interview process is based trick questions. I've interviewed people for jobs where they didn't know the language we used and I let them solve the coding problem in whatever language they felt comfortable with, even if it was a language I don't know!
One bad interview doesn't mean it's all over. There are companies that don't do the logic-puzzle type of interview and can accommodate a junior developer who still needs to learn some of the ropes. 
Definitely don't give up! It's completely possible to teach yourself and move into development. I'd advise working on projects as much as possible (which it sounds like you've done!) as a way to learn. Also, if you are interested in a bootcamp but don't want to pay the cost, check out [Lambda School](https://lambdaschool.com/). Their bootcamp is has no tuition but you pay a specified percentage of your salary (17%) for two years once you get a job that pays more than $50k/year. The total amount of repayment is capped at $30k. I'm not affiliated with them in any way but have heard a lot about them recently. :) 
&gt; If you end up using AWS, your flow would look like this user uploads file to your website, website uploads file to Amazon S3 bucket, lambda function initiates an Elastic Transcoder job on the uploaded file, the job completes and puts the transcoded/edited file back in the bucket. A slightly better flow would be to have the web server provide a pre-signed URL for S3 upload, and then the file upload goes straight to S3 (less load on your web server and typically faster uploads).
You are not wrong.
Don’t give up, short answer. Keep working on your skills, read about algorithms. Sometimes the problem are the interviewees themselves — and don’t worry about the time, it’s literally their job. You got this, maybe you haven’t found the right company for you. 
Don't give up. My first programming interview was for an unpaid internship. The guy I interviewed with wanted to see a personal project. I didn't have one because I was straight out of college and my professors were extremely demanding. There was zero time for personal projects. He was a total dickhead about it. He told me he didn't believe I actually wanted to be a programmer and that I should be living and breathing waterfall methodology. He gave me a homework assignment: go make a personal project and send him an email explaining what I learned while working on this project. I wanted to give up there and then. If this is how it was going to be, I wanted no part of it. I didn't do his stupid homework assignment. Fuck that guy. Fast forward a few years. I'm working as a developer for a large company on a team I absolutely love. Three people on my team had actually worked for that prick earlier in their career and they absolutely loathed him. They said it was the worst job they'd ever had and they left as soon as possible. Stick with it and try to learn something at each interview you fail. I've failed plenty. Don't take it personally. Sometimes you'll have great chemistry with an interviewer, sometimes you'll fall apart in front of them, and sometimes the interviewer is a horrible person you definitely won't want to work for. 
I would second this, if they’re evaluating their developers on how well they can solve math problems it might be better to look elsewhere. That being said, looking up some basic cs fundamentals like data structures and software patterns. They should’ve also just gone with whatever language you know since once you know how to program, they need to see how you problem solve rather than if you know language specific stuff. learning new languages is about learning syntax and libraries which is usually a google or a talk with a coworker away. 
When I would interview developers, the idea wasn't for them to necessarily be able to solve every problem presented to them, but to see how the approached problems solving. Typically, we'd ramp up the problems until it was something they hadn't seen/done before. Our reasoning is that we'd rather know how the person deals with something they've never seen before that risk somebody hiding a serious problem until it became an embarrassment for the company...again.
This. The interviews are not trying to make sure you get the right answer, they want to see how you think about tough problems. A lot of people, especially when they are more junior, get very worried about not knowing how to approach the problem. That’s okay. It sounds like it would be helpful to work on your skills at really understanding what is being asked for (you didn’t feel like you knew what they were asking you to do), and to make sure you walk through your thinking and break problems down. Don’t give up; when you encounter things you think are beyond you capability and then work to develop those skills, that’s when you’re able to really grow. 
Oh, okay that was my mistake. But if you don't need the `if`s the change is still just minimal: This: match([1,2,3]): 1: print("abc") 4: print("def") should be equal to this: for x in [1,2,3]: if x == 1: print("abc") if x == 4: print("def") Something I still don't quite understand how `elif` would work in your match syntax. in your original example `elif` seems to be equal to any other case e.g.: match([2,3]): 1: print("abc") 2: print("def") and match([2,3]): 1: print("abc") elif 2: print("def") should print the same. Is this correct? Could you give me an example of how you would use the current value in a case to call a function: Like this: for x in [1,2,3]: if isinstance(x, str): print("string") and like this: for x in [1, 2, 3]: if x in [2, 4]: do_something(x) 
That, also don't pretend you understand something if you really didn't. That's the worst thing to do. The worst kind of employee/developer is one who's to afraid to ask question when he doesn't understand something he's supposed to do. You don't wan to hire someone like that. And really, you can't fool people, if you don't understand what they re asking you, they'll figure that out sooner or later. \&gt; especially when they are more junior Acutally... somewhat disagree. Not that this normal, but the 'especially when they are more junior'. Even senior developers spend a lot of time googling and looking for answers. Most of what we deal with every day is figuring out how things work, what actually is the problem we are trying to solve and how we might to implement a solution. That literally \*is\* the job. So never be afraid to admit you don't know something. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
"on" was supposed to be "or". I was basically pointing out that the solution to something using too much CPU on your server is to use more servers. Whether thats lambda or digitalocean or whatever. FWIW, using lambda is the same thing as using more servers. Your functions are running on servers they're just abstracted away from you.

A hearty congratulations to you. Your bad experience is where many would kill to be...you actually got an interview!!! What a great learning experience it was indeed. So you got a bit of a hiding...happens to the best of us. The advantage for you now is that firstly, you can only do better and secondly you have awareness of ypur weaknesses and can plan how to fill the holes. A bit of advice that has always helped me : if you want to be in the industry look two positions ahead. Find at least three job adverts from the same position in as many different companies. Look at the skills list...now perform a gap analysis of where you are now and where you WILL be. Write a plan of how you will bridge this gap over a certain timeframe. Learn the plan and take it with you on your next interview. This is concrete proof to a potential employer that you are aware of your weaknesses and have a plan on how to overcome them. This kind of preparation speaks volumes. They can see how you are looking ahead and how this position, that you currently want, fits into the bigger picture. Good companies look for people to invest in. People who will grow. They will want to help shape that future. It beautifully kills the old 'where do you see yourself in X year's time. So you are cack at maths now...you have already found the courses that will remedy this. Don't be afraid to ask them for their opinions...this will get them to invest in your plans amd future. Best of luck and keep us all posted.
If that is not enough constructive for you just pass by. That is a drawer quality code. 
It needs Python 3, you're using Python 2.

Gotcha interview questions are a sign of a bad interviewer. 
There is truth in your post, but there are ways to say things man. Your not entitled to protect everyone from butt hurt, but common dude a little bit of friendliness goes a long way for a fellow human being. 
Don't give up! My first job they didn't respond to me so I pestered them repeatedly and they still didn't respond to me. I took too long to do the homework, and after 6 months of my bothering they seemingly begrudgingly hired me. I was the lowest performer on their team. I was able to move on from there to another job in a new location, which I was genuinely lucky to get. I knew basically nothing. After staying there for a while I interviewed for a better job at a well known company and got turned down pretty harshly by the end of the interview. Then I tried to apply to other companies but frequently got denied at the phone screen, not even getting to interviews. I then tried for another company but struggled with the coding assignment and took weeks (when it should have taken a day). But the boss liked my attitude and took me on. My entire career has been riddled with being unqualified and being turned down. I went to a cheap state school and didn't study computer science. The only way to success is to keep trying - there are lots of jobs with lots of companies and lots of bosses and lots of opportunities. Every opportunity is different and there is a place for you, you just need to keep finding opportunities and making the most of them. I'm currently making mid to high six figures as a software engineer. Just don't give up! You'll get there.
Nah. Not when you do things in python catching completely unrelated exceptions in one try block just to unwrap that as if ladder and call a script the “CLI app”. 
Not necessarily - there's still a lot of value in seeing how the interviewee would approach difficult problems.
My point is that developers should be evaluated on problem solving with code rather than knowing specific language syntax, especially entry level. 
Just to join the crowd: don't give up. From your account, it seems like you had a shitty first interview. They won't ALL be like that. It also sounds like you're doing better then you're giving yourself for: you can actually use python to do useful stuff, talk to databases, use frameworks. So, my advice is twofold: First, keep trying, but maybe not at this company. Second, do lookup some more in-depth computer science concepts, and do some practice interview questions: not all interviews are gonna be this bad, but a fair amount will be in this crappy ballpark (in name of the IT industry, I apologize). Third (because off-by-one errors happen all the time), maybe get involved with opensource. It's good for learning more about technology, you might meet some nice folks (specially in the python community!), and it might open some doors for you too. 
great recc., it's a really good book. I solved a number of the problems in it and really enjoyed it. Also, If you need to improve your knowledge on Data Structure and Algorithms another good book is: [A Common-Sense Guide to Data Structures and Algorithms](https://pragprog.com/book/jwdsal/a-common-sense-guide-to-data-structures-and-algorithms) by Jay Wengrow. It's a really pleasant read. The examples are in a mix of Ruby and Python if I remember correctly.
and that is why I ask hard problems or problems that you have to have an aptitude for like pointers or recursion. Gotcha question are often when someone is trying to look smart and if the candidate has no chance to solve it you learn less.
hahaha ive heard stories!
a long arduous journey.... :P
I take it your a software dev working in a team? Maybe this person is just looking for validation? Cuz they doubt themselves or they want external validation before their internal validation works? I'm sure there were times that your life had the same kinda moments, I know mines did. Just cuz you said "good job", or voice your criticisms of the code in a non-degrading manner doesn't mean your losing anything. And HOLY shit I just looked at the code, your points are pretty valid, for the life of me I couldn't follow the flow. OP could have used Click or something similar to do the same task.

Listen, i bet 90% of my down voters are either entities with delicate inner self organization or didn’t even peek at that CLI app. Given the fact op has a paying job i find the advice quite sounding. If i were him/her I’d strongly take it into account. Cheers. 
I can see what you're saying. But I feel like there's still value in testing green candidates with a curve ball just to see how they handle it. Most days it seems like 80% of my job is sorting out compromises for production issues that have no ideal solution, so maybe I'm biased in wanting to see how candidates deal with those situations. It's the Kobayashi Maru scenario.
Start applying for smaller startups that _only_ require Python and aren't going to bullshit around giving you Java questions. Keep applying and keep going for it - you _will_ get a job from it eventually. The trickiest bit is just to be thinking like a developer and to believe you can be a developer! Almost like being a tourist in a city and being comfortable as a resident. It's the same with developing
Apart from the obvious question of the value of such a script, there is another one... why two scripts that are essentially the same? 
I had a job interview where I was given a small project to code. It was in a language I was not familiar with and they had only scheduled the interview with me the day before. I totally bombed it. When it was time to present my "work" I just showed them I had nothing and then tried to explain I could learn it with more time... I didn't get that job. But I didn't give up either. You learn something from every interview. Sometimes you learn that you don't want to work at a place.
Dont' give up! Your performance in artificial interview tests does not have much to do with how well you will do you job. Getting you first programming job is just a painful hurdle to overcome.
Lol well either way, this guy/gal has potential, as does everyone else. If they cherry pick their way around your criticisms for the meat of it, they'll do fine. Anyhow, have a good day stranger.
 #tuples make it more readable and make sense from first read. #it can used for searching in big database for multi iteam #can be used alot by game development on event handling ex. if key.pressed == KEY.Enter: print('enter pressed') if key.pressed == KEY.ESC: print('esc pressed') if key.pressed == KEY.Up: print('up pressed') or use match: #see how it's easy simply think match = if #use can use when with no parameter like this match(): key.pressed == KEY.Up: print('up pressed') key.pressed == KEY.Enter: print('enter pressed') key.pressed == KEY.Esc: print('esc pressed') #and like this match([2,'Hello',3]): #do it only if up key is pressed and 'Hello' is matched with list so why it's called match key.pressed == KEY.Up and ('Hello,'): print('up pressed') key.pressed == KEY.Enter: print('enter pressed') key.pressed == KEY.Esc: print('esc pressed') egg = [2,'Hello',3] match(egg): #if x in 2 or 4 it's will print(x+1) if x in (2,4): print(x+1) elif ('Hello!',): print('Hello World!') else ('Hello',): print('Hello World') ​idea maybe it's good for gui/game development and DB search so why it's called match() my english is not very well :/
Like many people said, this is not how everyone does it. Google and Microsoft ask hard questions and everyone thinks they should do it also. We do have a coding problem for people to solve, but its not terribly difficult and for entry level we ask them to talk through it as they are going so we can see the thought process. But there is one of those and its not a mind-bender at all. So keep tinkering, practicing and stick with finding a place. 
Ha! 99% of the applications I work on involve little math. The worst it gets is sum up a bunch of account's balances or multiply the quantity of something times the price. The kind of math you knew in grade school. Occasionally you might need to find the average of something. Just keep interviewing. You'll find something. 
not even google would make you do a whiteboard problem in a language you don't know.

Don't give up. * Buy Cracking the Coding Interview. * Check out this site: [https://www.interviewbit.com/](https://www.interviewbit.com/) * Check out the /r/dailyprogrammer sub and use those challenges to dip your toes in some other languages. I know we are in the Python sub, but seriously learn other languages. I personally hate Java, but learning it will force you to learn OOP principles, especially the important ones like inheritence. Python supports OOP, but it doesn't strictly enforce those concepts. Maybe even try your hand at a functional language like Haskell. Learning how to do things with a strictly functional language can challenge you to think about problems differently and how you might approach solving them. &amp;#x200B; Honestly, everything you learned in your intro to programming course is a sufficient foundation for you to build on. Don't waste your money on a bootcamp, because they likely won't teach you anything you don't already know or can't easily learn on your own. 
Sounds like your company doesn't know how to interview programmers/developers/software engineers. Don't judge yourself on one bad interview.
I read the links... I was just hinting you to try and come up with a single script that handles both cases... 
Four different interviewers? Wtf
If the job really was pure-python and the interviewer forced you to work with Java, it was a stitch-up. Besides, dev people at large-ish companies don't look kindly on candidates coming from service desks - they have formal channels to get graduates, and even your current manager likely doesn't want you to leave if you're any good. Try again elsewhere, maybe after reading up on typical interview questions. Good luck!
I dont know anyone who passed every tech interview they went to. I personally failed many interviews before getting an idea about how to approach tech interview. That being said, your skills are quite far below the current tech hiring bar. First, knowing only 1 language is absolutely terrible. Every engineers in Google know at least 5 popular languages Second, I dont think the interviewers are unfair at all. An employee costs a lot. An incompetent employee costs a lot more. Companies designed their hiring processes to have as little false positive as possible, even if it means they sacrifice some recalls. Third, coding interview is a beast in itself. You gotta hunker down and *study* hard for it. I have BS, MS and PhD in Computer Science and I’d still take a month off to study for the interviews. All my friends take these interviews very seriously. In short, dont give up. But the field is very hard. You need to devote a lot of time and efforts into turning yourself into a stronger software engineer.
ye but....it certainly helps when completing those things!
Question seems like a gotcha question when you have no idea how to approach them. Like, if you dont know DP, then any DP questions seem like a gotcha question.
this is a good recommendation for starter. But this book is definitely necessary but insufficient. Look into leetcode, Elements of Programming Interviews.
Its kinda funny and condescending to assume that you know better than these companies.
That's hilarious. I use it to read op2s and never really looked into the card section.
Be passionate about achieving your end-goal, that helps a lot with getting those things you are not really passionate about but need to do to achieve that goal done
How are tuples making it more readable? I seriously do not know. &gt; `#see how it's easy simply think match = if` Why are you not using `if` then if it is the same. Right now I don't see any benefits over using `if`. Wait a second, `match()` would still try to find a case which it could match against? # What would this do? match(): None: print("Okay") 2: print("Is this possible") # Would this work differently? match([]): None: print("Okay") 2: print("Is this possible") &gt; match(egg): &gt; … &gt; if x in (2,4):print(x+1) This would make `match` behave exactly like a for loop. &gt; match(egg): &gt; … &gt; #elif,else &gt; not ('Hello',): print('Hello') &gt; elif ('Hello!',): print('Hello World!') &gt; else ('Hello',): print('Hello World') This part of your example changes the syntax of three existing keywords or at least two because `else ('Hello',)` makes absolutly no sense to me and seems more like an copy and paste error.
That's fair. |But he also told me it was kind of a trick question and that the actual answer involved using floats and modulo to get the answer. I took that as more of a hard question than a gotcha question, since it seems there was a solution that doesn't seem especially obscure. I'd be curious to hear what the question was.
Thanks for your recommendation.
If you're supposed to notice some aspect of the question itself, then sure. If you're supposed to know the exact details of how floats and modulo interact (I thought modulo was by definition an operation on integers, so either there's trickery or I'm missing something) and you're not interviewing for a position where those details are extremely important, then I'd call it a gotcha.
 #like this #tuple so stupid in syntax :/ match(egg): #reomve Noun print("Okay") 2: print("Is this possible") match(egg): #why if? x in (2,4):print(x+1) #it's looks better match(egg): not 'Hello': print('Hello') elif 'Hello!': print('Hello World!') else 'Hello': print('Hello World') [tuple just stupid] [i'm noting it, thanks for the feedback] &amp;#x200B;
Hey dude, the questions aren't meant to trip you up, they're there to test your knowledge and show your level of experience or expertise. However you may feel right now, learn from it and keep pushing forward! 
Do not give up! I had to interview at least 20 times to actually get an offer as a Jr. Web Developer, and I have a B.A in Anthropology and graduated from coding boot camp. Many of the interviews for major corporations involved ridiculous programming and math challenges. But companies that actually need a specific type of developer (Front End in my case) do not do this ridiculous whiteboarding examination. A lot of being a developer is how well you c an work with the team and get your job done. Companies that whiteboard are using an ineffective and outdated interviewing process. Even the best senior programmers in 2018 use google to find basic syntax. Thus, please do not be discouraged and continue on your quest of getting a developer job! 
&gt;Interviewer: asks a question &gt;Me: Stares at whiteboard for 30 minutes &gt;Me: Done &gt;Interviewer: But you did nothing. &gt;Me: Oh? You dont know whitespace? 
It seems the interviewers were trying to prove how smart *they* were - it was either all about them OR it was all about what you didn’t know (Java - by some measures a language that will soon enter the zone of obsolescence). They didn’t want to know what you knew - they were more interested in exposing you. But you exposed them - as being undeserving of your talent. Let’s genuinely spin it like that . Was this a startup? - with an attitude like that I am betting these guys will move to another job soon - durability isn’t likely to be their strength. It’s all about scoring points.
Now that you have some experience what parts of conventional software development practices do you find yourself using the most? Personally I've been programming python data processing pipeline for my research for a year but never took a software architecture/dev class and I am wondering what I'm missing.
In my experience most interviews are like this, but certainly not all. I can't help but think though that your preparation for the interview would've led you to complete a bunch of practice riddles and questions from the internet. Did it not? How do you do with those? Anyways, you can very well find a job that doesnt do interviews like this. In fact I give interviews at my company and don't give riddles or trick questions. If you live in the bay area and are open to working development other than Python PM me and i'll happily refer you.
why **match()** not if or loop? match() will structure a lot of useless if in one codeblock thats can used anywhere and anywhere with find function of list or tuple or something else that can be used for a lot of purposes! \----------------------------------
I recently had a six hour long interview in which I have four hour long technical interviews back to back. I hadn't eaten breakfast or had coffee and we started at 9am. I didn't get a single "ideal" answer and asked one of them to repeat a question an uncountable amount of times. In the end that one amounted to writing a simple for loop. Honestly the worst interview of my life. Guess where I work now? Haha. It isn't always about being right, it's about seeing how you work in those situations. And if it is about being right, then study more and continue forward. Don't let this act as a barrier, let it be a learning opportunity. You got this!
Not op but thank you for an interesting book recommendation i’ll have a look at it. 
Even though python contains some convenience functions I do not think that `it looks better` works if you try to push a PEP forward. What would the output of this be match([None, 2]): print("Okay") 2: print("2") `Okay, Okay, 2` or `Okay, 2` ? Why are you writing `else 'Hello'` again? `else` is meant to be the fallback case which always Matches if Nothing else does. The `'Hello'` should not do anything.
What kind of shit head cancels an interview they're supposed to do? If that was really their reasoning then fuck them.
Good thing you didn't get that job. Those people are not the ones you want to work for. Real job problems are solved by experience, research, and consultation with peers! 
I'd argue that questions that rely on one specific trick to solve are gotcha questions for the purpose of an interview. You have limited time, are stressed, and there's a chance you've never been directly exposed to that specific trick in the first place. All it does is guarantee you won't do as well as you could in the interview, for no real purpose. 
ok, look will look like this if you use for loop! foo = ['banana','apple','Apricots','Clementine','Dates'] for x in foo: if x == ['banana']: print(x+1) if x == ['apple']: print(x+2) #and .... but with match :D match(foo): 'bnnana':print(x+1) elif 'Banana':print(x+2) else:print('this will be printed') #oneline 'apple':print(x+2) 'Apricots':print(x+3) 'Clementine':print(x+4) 'Dates':print(x+5) this is the original idea before some ideas that make it's useless keyword. btw this is very easy straightforward. and no any other ideas will be added it's just make worse and no parameter it's good idea tho.. it's make sense to me be this look it's so easy :D &amp;#x200B;
General problem solving skills are really important. The worst programmers I've worked with run with the first idea that comes to mind and refuse to rethink their approach. There are sometimes days where I plan, think, and communicate without writing a line of code. To be less general, I've spent most of my career pulling data from databases, transforming that data into reports or views and displaying the data to users in some form. I use arrays, enumerables, maps, and hashsets a lot. Learn SQL if you haven't already. Every company I've worked for or interviewed at has used a relational database.
That's noble but it's wrong to pretend that already knowing the particular language you're going to be using is not a competitive advantage in an interview context. 
That was a really terrible interview process. Whiteboard riddles are the WORST way to interview most software development candidates. If they were hiring you for a Jr. level Python development position, they should have asked questions in Python that are just outside of a beginner's grasp in order to better gauge your problem solving skills; not whether or not you understand the arcane minutiae of an arbitrary riddle that has nothing to do with the problems the team is solving on a daily basis. Don't give up hope!
Based on the description of how they acted I’m guessing they were running you through the ringer because they didn’t plan on hiring you even before they met you. Maybe they had someone else they wanted already picked out or had some reason based on company politics or their egos. The job market is very good right now. Keep at it. You’ll do fine. 
Well I haven't programmed in a while at the time I made these, and have never programmed seriously before, just learned then. I could make one, because I know Windows doesn't use a shebang and relies more on the file extension, but this was just my quick way of doing it.
I second this as well! Just to add, we have all had bad interviews. Interviews are weird. Sometimes you or the interviewer are having an off day which will definitely effect the outcome of the interview. Also, it is worth looking at books like “Cracking the Coding Interview” to get a better grasp of questions you will likely be asked. Since OP is not coming from a technical background, books like this are important to get a crash course in underlying CS basics like time complexity, basic data structures, algorithms and jargon. 
&gt; After the third time I asked him to repeat it I just pretended to understand. This is the only thing that made me think you did bad. Never do this. More than likely they are throwing hard shit at you to see if you do something like this. Dude, you'll be fine. Just try again. This isn't one shot and you're done, this is keep shooting until you hit one in.
If you put every `print` on the same line as the `if` condition it would almost look like your `match` Statement. &gt; `'bnnana':print(x+1) elif 'Banana':print(x+2) else:print('this will be printed') #oneline` The `else` clause either will never be reached or the output for `foo = ['BANANAS', 'apple'] would be: this will be printed # caused by BANANAS; as BANANAS != bnnana and BANANAS != Banana this will be printed # caused by apple; as apple != bnnana and apple != Banana x+2 # caused by apple; as apple == apple
Banana peels are eaten in many parts of the world, though it is not very common in the west. *** ^^^I'm&amp;#32;a&amp;#32;Bot&amp;#32;*bleep*&amp;#32;*bloop*&amp;#32;|&amp;#32;[&amp;#32;**Unsubscribe**](https://np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=BananaFactBot&amp;subject=I%20hate%20potassium&amp;message=If%20you%20would%20like%20to%20unsubscribe%20from%20banana%20facts%2C%20send%20this%20private%20message%20with%20the%20subject%20%27I%20hate%20potassium%27.%20)&amp;#32;|&amp;#32;[**🍌**](https://np.reddit.com/r/BananaFactBot/comments/8acmq6/banana/?st=jfof9k8d&amp;sh=acd80944)
The only way to be sure you won't succeed is if you give up now. Give yourself some time to process the interview, try to understand what went wrong, try to improve, give it another shot. Good luck! 
I second this comment. A software developer doesn't just know the answer to any problem they encounter - they are good at getting answers to problems. Breaking things down into easily managed problems and then solving those to build into a larger solution. Keep practicing whiteboarding. Find a website you like and walk yourself through problems. I talk to myself out loud and pretend that I am teaching a class/walking somebody else through the solution. I especially like codewars because it shows you solutions that other people have come up with. My solution is almost never the "top" one which means I have something to learn from after I've understood and solved the problem.
So my first interview was really bad. I was stressed obviously, but my social skill amswer were boring, and technical one wrong special. It was some java algorithm. I succeeded all the following one, and next job i got made me several year after technical director. I am not trying to brag here, but between stress and type of question, you can fuck up. Do not give up, keep going, even if you were not good with algorithm, plenty of company do not care of such skill, so do not worry, it might take you couple of try but you ll get there. 
Yeah, I feel for OP but giving up and just pretending you understand something is simply kind of poison. I have a feeling that that single thing may be what caused the cancellation. If you take one lesson from this, OP, I think it should be this.
What kind of shit head makes a job candidate that has no chance of being hired for the position sit through a 30 minute interview?
That's definitely a horse shit interview. I would have walked shortly after the Java guy. You really shouldn't have had to put up with that. They were obviously unprepared. Riddles are what lazy ill prepared interviewers give. Just keep going. Eventually interviewing will become routine for you. A skill.
Don’t give up... but maybe learn another language too. Only knowing Python will limit the way you think as a programmer. CS grads come out of school knowing multiple languages. When you get hired you’re going to need to learn new stuff so might as well try it now. 
Seems like bad interview process. Really you can think of it as a way to filter on company culture. 
I had a very bad interview once. I went to UCLA and got a degree in Electrical Engineering. After I graduated I couldn't seem to get an interview anywhere. Finally got an interview at a chip company called Maxim. The interview was like a 6 hour test basically. I specialized in EE with biomed applications so I took a lot of premed classes where I would've normally taken EE classes and also got 0 hands on experience at UCLA. If you took a class on circuits at UCLA you would never actually touch a circuit board and would basically just do really complicated math the whole quarter. So I had really few applicable skills by the time I had graduated when many people who went to worse schools had more. But I had shown I can learn quickly and I'm very smart otherwise I wouldn't have gone there and graduated. My interviewer told me I was the worst candidate out of 35 and basically laughed me out of the interview. I got really really depressed afterward. Why am I taking a 6 hour test for an entry level job that will require on the job training anyway? Since then no interviews have gone half that bad. But yeah, you're going to have some miserable interviews in your life. Some companies just make the process terrible. I have now been working for 5 years at a major hardware company and just got another promotion on Monday with 11% pay raise, so things change. You just need to keep on it and eventually you'll get the job. Don't let it get to you. 
Also: most interviews go badly, that's why on average people apply and get interviewed for more than one job before getting an offer. And to repeat what others have said again: different companies have radically different interviews.
I think it depends what the job asks of you. I work with a few guys who came from coding camps and they're good at getting thingd to work without having a clue how to explain it or maintain it. It's very frustrating because you have to babysit them and do tons of code reviews. You become their teachers. They're hard working and will work on anything you ask them to work on....that's pretty darn valuable, but I think we underestimated how much handholding they would need and we've essential lost a developer as a result of bringing in 4 people with minimal experience. 
There is not an oversupply of good developers. There is a massive supply of really bad ones and an oversupply of relatively better ones. But finding really strong developers is extremely hard. Especially ones that have the necessary soft skills to manage and mentor others. We fired a guy after 2 days because his older brother did all his interviews and we didn't know until after he started. I felt terrible for him because he moved for the job... But it's totally his fault for cheating us. 
I still think it is (or was? Our werkzeug version is old) a bug. If file handle needs to remain open after function exits, it should duplicate the file descriptor so me closing it would have no effect.
Interview questions that use the modulo operator is kind of indicative of a bad question. Not a lot of self taught people know this operator because it's so infrequently used.
[This is a useful article to read](http://blog.interviewing.io/you-cant-fix-diversity-in-tech-without-fixing-the-technical-interview/). It's from a company that does an online interview platform, and looks at their data. Choice quote: &gt; As you can see, roughly 25% of interviewees are consistent in their performance, but the rest are all over the place. And over a third of people with a high mean (&gt;=3) technical performance bombed at least one interview. Whole thing's worth reading, though. Tech interviewing is awful.
Huh, is that what that magical percent sign operator I use all the time is called? Never knew. /s
so I can just install this and my app can send "system message" email with this ?
This sounds like every developers first interview. Even after I've been in the biz for about 15 years I more or less failed a coding interview last year. The world needs developers so try somewhere else. Btw, I see other comments about interviewers seeing how you go about solving the problem...your process. This is absolutely true. My interview style is to give an almost impossible problem. Then I tell the candidate that we're going to do it together. I do this to gauge teamwork. 
Don’t give up. I went from entry level support to mid-level engineer in 5 years, and I’m terrible at math. If it’s what you want to do, then keep at it. 
Seems like one of those things you would say up front, not during a second interview. If I don't put Java on my resume, and the job description doesn't say I should know Java, don't ask me questions about Java. If you need someone who can write Java on Day 1, then you're the one who wasted our time, not me. Honestly, even if I do know the language you ask me about, I take it as a big red sign if you weren't organized enough to tell me before getting balls deep into the second interview.
Also, please do know how to use modulo to solve regular programming problems. Trick questions sometimes touch upon comp sci and ds/also fundamentals.
Did you see the data? It's a super easy job 
i agree with everyone that this seems to be at least as much a fault on their side as you seem to see on yours. as for maths, well. it's a thing. it helps, almost always, everywhere. and good news: everyone can do it. humans are amazing at maths, every single one of us! the way it's thought in school turns so many people off, it really breaks my heart because it's so beautiful! imagine seeing art the first time when before you where blind or hearing music for the first time when before you where deaf. discovering that there are libraries full of amazing tales and stories out there after you learned to read. that's the level of beauty maths has in store for you once you learn it. a good way to connect the learning of programming and the learning of maths is [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) you can write in any language you want, you can look up any clues you want. it's about improving yourself. and best of all, if you know all of those, you'll be able to smack any interviewer coming at you with math riddles with an instant answer right across his smug white board.
&gt; The whole interview was essentially how well can you solve riddles using math. Well, I'm probably never going to be able to do that. #Not with *that* attitude, you won't. Here's what I would do if I were you: I'd work through as much of [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) as I could. Some of it is very easy. Some of it is very hard. All of it is math-intensive. You **do** very much need to learn how to solve math riddles because math riddles are just a simplified version of what much of real-world programming is. Remember, **programming is applied mathematics (sort of)**. But mostly, you need to show your interviewers that you have a good idea about how to go about solving problems -- more importantly, how to go about understanding what the actual problem is. &gt; Should I give up? Of course not! &gt; Are all interviews like this? No. &gt; Where have I gone wrong? You choked in an interview. It's a learning experience. It's good that you had that opportunity. Moreover, you haven't studied all the python functions and learned what they're for. Otherwise, the problem with the modulo would have been more obvious to you. &gt; After the third time I asked him to repeat it I just pretended to understand. That's a showstopper mistake. If you don't understand a question, ask him to rephrase it. &gt; I went home and got very, very drunk. Sounds like a professional programmer to me!
This reminds me of the worst interview I've had, and honestly, it's not you, it's them. Don't give up, keep at it. &gt; he wrote on the board was in Java - I don't know Java. If the interviewer knew this, then they made a mistake. Someone coming from a pure python scripting experience shouldn't be expected to follow a java example in an interview situation. The interviewer could have done it in pseudo code. &gt; The third interviewer came in and also asked me some really hard math riddle. I've experienced this kind of interviewer, and it's just showboating. This guy wanted to feel smart, and its bullshit. I don't feel these kinds of questions are fair to do in an interview because they don't accurately tell you how a person would actually perform on the job. Some job interviews are going to suck, don't let them discourage you. As long as you have the drive to learn these skills on your own, your doing good. You'll find a place that's a good match. You probably dodged a bullet not getting that job. 
&gt; mid six figures you make $500,000 a year as a software engineer?
Using tkinter i'm trying to run a test GUI script. The results on the right are from my MacOS machine and the results on the left are from my Win10 machine. I'm curious why my MacOS machine is giving me this blank result when it's the same identical code. Both computers are running Python3.7.

I interviewed for what I thought was a Ruby on Rails position a few years ago. They kept asking me C# questions. I was honest, I told them I didn't know C# and answered the questions the best I could using Ruby, Python, or Javascript. I did wind up getting the job.
The company doesn't care if you're self taught or not. I feel like it's pretty reasonable to expect someone interviewing for a dev position to know operators that are in most common languages.
Exactly. One of the best ways to prep is to know how to verbalize your thought process. Get good at explaining your thinking in a logical way. The teams that are worth joining aren’t going to spend the interview throwing you curveballs and dinging you on wrong answers, and they don’t get hung up on specific tool knowledge. Tools can easily be learned. Thought process and problem-solving cannot. 
There’s a mod. I think it’s called computer craft that add a computer terminal and turtles to the game that you can program to mine, farm, and do lots of other stuff. I think it uses Lua. I’ve played around with it. It’s pretty good. 
Oh. So you should only encounter problems you know the answer to in a dev environment? Giving an interviewee a problem written in a language they are not used to see is a good way to figure out how they handle that. Do they immediately shut down and get frustrated? Do they fake it and hope they are right? Do they ask for a general idea of what the code is doing to determine how the problem could be solved in a language they do understand? Are they comfortable asking for help or clarification on things they don't understand? The take away is "how does this person overcome road blocks?" Over coming roadblock type questions are part of every interview. In ops case it was just a very hands on road block experience. 
Also, please feel free to provide criticism/suggestions - I know I still have a lot more to learn. Unless you're criticizing from a code style / documentation perspective, in which case - according to google standards, I need to maintain consistency with myself. Mustn't break google standards now!
Jesus Christ, don't give up on the first go. Not all interviews are like this. I, personally, have never had an interview that lasted more than one round. Employers who know what they are doing concern themselves with whether or not you can do the job they're hiring you for and not some 'entry test for MIT' bullshit. Just apply elsewhere :)
Hey I just wanted to throw my personal anecdote onto the pile. Don't let this interview get you down. I absolutely bombed my first three or four interviews, but eventually landed a contract entry-level position. Six years later, I just got promoted to senior developer at a Big Five tech company. If you have drive, aptitude, and a willingness to learn, you can be successful once you get your foot in the door.
the only thing worse is testing bitwise operator knowledge. What are you using it on so often? What was the last thing you used it for?

Good programmers never blame the tools....
Hah, assuming that I'm a good programmer.
You went through a fundamentally broken interview process. And it's the norm. Nobody does any of the shit they did on whiteboards when they're getting paid. Because it's a dumb way to code. They only thing they're testing is if you've read "cracking the coding interview" recently. How the industry got here: some people were good at getting computers to do things. So they were asked to get more people to do those things. The problem is the second step: now someone who has been trained their entire career to get computers to do things has to evaluate humans. They've never studied human behavior or cognition. The result is a weird interviewing standard that only evaluates how well you do weird interviews and is not at all reflective of the work. I'm trying to change this. You can read about the next gen [here.](https://engineering.checkr.com/breaking-the-mold-interviews-at-checkr-e9dbf370e0f6)
I'm not sure what this meme is supposed to be, but it doesn't seem funny or interesting or true in any meaningful sense that would make it worth posting. Also, why not just post this to /r/ProgrammerHumor if you just want to make memes about python?
What kind of clown uses Java to interview a Python-only developer. You had a bad interview. **ONE BAD INTERVIEW** Next one could be entirely different.
Could you draw a diagram of a use case? I think it'll make more sense with a visual.
I'd argue that language is a bad indicator if you want someone long lasting as a software engineer but a good indicator if it's a short term need (unless you are really hiring an expert). The unfortunate truth is that some languages have quirks that you need to work around. For example, the GIL in python vs the event scheduler in Node. I've seen programmers used to python fail at node because the scheduler becomes empty because of async tasks. Or the fact that java requires the `.toEqual()` function to be called rather than `==` because of a lack of operator overloading, and there's a whole slew of API differences. Honestly I've been in a position in an interview where trying to figure out the various APIs made the entire experience more difficult than actually solving the problem programmatically. 
Mmm I can definitely do so tomorrow. In the meantime, let's say you have ClassA with a bunch of unique methods and ClassB with other unique methods. If both were decorated with @assimilate, to translate an instance of ClassA to ClassB -&gt; all you'd have to do is ClassA(some\_class\_b\_instance) to get an instance of ClassA with all the state/attribute of the previous ClassB instance. (It shares the same \_\_dict\_\_) Meanwhile, the pointer to the ClassB instance now goes to the ClassA instance - meaning you don't need to update pointers to your original object. So far as everything outside the object is concerned, the original object is still there. It's just a different class with new attributes!
Yes
I did post this to /r/programmerhumor, but it is also Python-specific.

I’ve used that mod a bit also. My computer is pretty much a potato so it can’t handle much mods
Ha, expensive bootcamps.... let me help ya there and say don’t waist your money on a bootcamp. They are overpriced and taking from what you’ve mentioned it seems like a bootcamp wouldn’t give you any more of an edge(imo, I paid for an expensive one). I’ve had dozens of interviews over the past 6-8 months and I’ve bombed some(many). People keep telling me to keep pushing forward. Gotta be the right place, the right time, the right fit. So to the question should you give up? Hell no. 
Yes, I'm trying to make a portable device. Thank you, this was extremely helpful.
The problem was, you probably entered into a Java shop that needed some automation done. They wanted to have someone with skills in both, so when your job automating was done, you could be an asset to the Java side. You did nothing wrong, it was just the wrong job for you, and honestly, they're reaching pretty far for someone who does Java and Python well at an entry level job. Don't give up on yourself, just give up on them. Going for an entry level position is always going to be a crap shoot. From my experience, companies interpret entry level as anything from "I used python once in college" to "I've created automation frameworks for the government using nothing but the standard python library and some duct tape". Keep looking, keep interviewing, and keep getting better. If you want help with a career path, or help looking at the right jobs to apply for, everyone here is willing to help, or just message me, I've got a few years in the python automation world, and a few decent recruiters in a few places around the US that can help find some interviews for you. Just drop me a DM. Stay sane!
Being any kind of decent developer basically requires you to be comfortable being uncomfortable. Solving logic problems and debugging are not skills that come naturally to anyone. If a bad interview is all of the adversity you can handle, you may be right to want to give up, but maybe not for the reason you're thinking.
Not all interviews are like this. Many you don’t even get to write code, many jobs you find because you know someone who you worked together at a hackathon. Maybe you’re just not good at technical interviews, or the actual job is very computer science oriented, but there are way more jobs that ask Fibonacci sequence and that’s it, specially for entry level.
&gt; I've used python on my own for automating tasks, interacting with APIs, and building my own side projects (using flask, sql, plotly, etc.) If you've done all of these things, you're more than qualified for an entry level job and would stand up well against many college graduates with no experience. I'd put as many of these projects as you can on a github account and use that as your portfolio when applying to future places (put it on your resume!). It goes a long way when I can look at your code before you come in and have an idea on specific areas I want to target during the interview. Sounds like your company has some pretty shit-tier interviewers, honestly. &gt; The interviewer gave me a programming problem that was like a riddle to solve. Riddles are dumb. If they asked you to write an algorithm or design a system, that's one thing and that's pretty standard. I'd need to know more here to judge. &gt; The second interviewer ... everything he wrote on the board was in Java - I don't know Java. He was aware of this and I kept having to ask for clarification about what the code was doing and then 'interpret' that into python. Probably some sort of OO nonsense that's specific to Java and requires having taken a Design Patterns class, if I had to guess. If the programmer couldn't switch to pseudo-code upon learning that you don't know Java, he's a terrible interviewer. Either way, probably not something you need to know going into an entry level job. &gt; The third interviewer came in and also asked me some really hard math riddle. Interviewers like this are unfortunately very common. They take some "important thing" that was hard for them to understand and then test people on it, because anyone who's as smart as them must know this thing too. They're wrong and 20 years behind where programming education has shifted to. I regularly interviewed entry-level python candidates at my last job. Shoot me a PM and I'll send along the problem I created for new grads if you're interested; 30-40 minutes tops.
Stuff you should understand: data structures, algorithms, debugging, databases, source control. That's honestly about it. A lot of "software engineering" instruction focuses on big picture stuff like designing the interworkings of a complex system so that they play well together. That's nice and all and you definitely need multiple people on your team who can do it. But if you're looking for a role as an entry-level engineer, you probably have little-to-no say in those discussions and can learn those skills on the job just by paying attention and asking questions.
Nah. It's definitely a bit rude to cut things short but you save everyone's time. Interviewing done right is a lot of work on both sides. Making 2 people who have no reason to be talking to each other sit in a room and solve problems for an hour is stupid.
If I wanted an object that has methods from two otherwise unrelated classes, wouldn't this be a pretty clear cut case for multiple inheritance (which I use only as a last resort)? +1 to seeing an example, can't even begin to understand why I'd want this without one.
projecteuler is good, but those problems are considerably more difficult than stuff you'll get in even the most rigorous interview. (I've had marathon interviews at multiple top 10 tech companies, and been offered jobs too.) I've been playing with interviewbit which in my experience is more representative of the worst you might get asked. (Which of course, makes sense because unlike projecteuler that's what it's for.)
Well, you come up with your example, I'll try the same thing my way, and we can see which one looks more polluted. :P
Well, by definition it only ever has the namespace of the _active_class's instance - so it is always more streamlined than other bridge and pimpl patterns I've seen 👅. Not to mention more generally applicable. How many arbitrary classes can you change between with a relatively slim wrapper?
&gt; most interviews go badly, I had like 4 interviews go great (in my mind) - didn't get a single offer. I had one terrible horrible no-good interview in which I almost disconnected my webcam in sheer shame. Got the job. 🤷‍♂️ I have no idea what's real.
Usually some problem on codingame.com will come up where I need a remainder or check for even/odd, or if one number is cleanly divisible by another. I did exaggerate my usage, but it is fairly frequent and useful. Bitwise ops are something I have spent next to 0 time learning/studying.
It took a while. It's nice to be able to plot the geometry 100x faster. MSC and NX have to be just slightly different. It's funny to see how people used to save on bytes and maintain backwards compatibility. Quads/tris have a float material angle theta and an int mcid/material coordinate system. So of course the mcid thera is calculated as `512.0*(mcid+1)`. You couldn't make a new quad format?
In terms of theoretical niceties I'm not really interested or knowledgeable enough to comment on how novel this is as a design pattern. In terms of how it works in practice for bridging two classes, I'm interested and curious. Gotta see real code, though.
/u/PremiumVIP Please?
I've been applying since January, took a couple month hiatus at a temporary job that really has nothing to do with programming. Still looking, unfortunately, I'm in a very popular tech area so ita a very saturated field. It's definitely demeaning. I'd be lying if I said I haven't almost given up in this field too.
FYI, someone's making a similar commercial product: https://beeline.co/
https://github.com/i008/easyimages Was working on this package, slim wrap on top Pil to make life easier especially exploring images / results etc. I find it useful myself maybe someone will also. 
I recently had one interview for a React position. When I got there the guy had a math background and asked me kind of a graphing/mathemetical question. I honestly had no idea what he was talking about. I said I though this was for React. I went through the motions and made some 'uh-huh' as he basically walked through the code. It would have had nothing to do with webdev. 
&gt; Solving logic problems and debugging are not skills that come naturally to anyone That's not true and it's not helpful to OP to say that. If they continue in the field, they'll run into tons of people who are naturals at logic and/or debugging. There *are* people who breezed through discrete math and software developer classes. They *will* be intimidating. But there are also just as many, if not more, people who had to work very hard on those skills.
1. There’s a reason a lot of people say to apply to the jobs you don’t want first, to get experience in interviewing for the jobs that you do want. Now you know more of what may be asked of you in future interviews. Also, in science, if you do an experiment and the results tell you nothing that you already didn’t know doesn’t mean that the experiment was a waste of time. In fact, by telling you nothing new it told you quite a lot. It could mean that what you tested for doesn’t affect what you think it affects, or that it confirms something you already assumed or knew which is a good thing. Just keep interviewing! 2. The question involving java … I would venture to say that they did that on purpose. You see, even though the job says “Python developer” what they are actually looking for is a “developer who knows Python.” At the end of the day, programming is programming, and the programming language is just a different hammer. I don’t care that you don’t know Java, I care that you know how to program. I care that you can infer what a function does by looking at the eg names and syntax. I don’t care if you knew what every single line does, I care that you know what the overall thing does. My advice is to focus less on the syntax and to look at the bigger picture. It’s okay to say “I’m not familiar with java so I can’t say 100% that this function does THIS, but based on these names and comments and using some intuition I feel like this line does this and that line does that.” and here’s the important part: “so based on this assumption, I would solve the problem by doing this, assuming that my assumptions are correct. In a real setting of course I would double check by looking up documentation or asking a colleague, but this is how I would do it with my limited knowledge at this moment in time.” That last bit is important because it says a lot about you. First it tells me that you are humble and know your limitations. It also tells me that you know how to find answers (google, colleagues). It also shows me a bit of your reasoning/intuition process by being able to guess what a thing. Finally, by saying “assuming I’m right, this is what I would do” it lets you solve the problem. It doesn’t matter if the “code” doesn’t work or if you made a wrong assumption, all that matters is that IF you had all the right cards you COULD solve it. 
Some programming overlaps with math though. Things like recursion, AI, algorithms in general, building models are part of programming but also require a mathematical approah to it. It may not explicitly use math to implement, but the thinking and mindset in approaching the problems are inherently mathematical. Perhaps programming can be thought of as math + engineering. Sorry to OP, but math is important. Not because you'll use it explicitly, but because it trains you to think in a way that programming requires.
OP, don't give up. You need to interview as much as possible. Sometimes these puzzles are used to evaluate logical thinking. But it also happens that sometimes the interviewer is more interested in showing how smart they are instead of evaluating the ability to perform the job. Everyone experiences such interviews from time to time. Just keep at it and you will encounter better ones. 
The people that interviewed you are bad, and our industry sucks at hiring practices. That is an unfortunate reality - and it's why it takes a few attempts (wasting both your time and opportunity \_and\_ the interviewers') to get into FAANG (I work in FAANG as a python-heavy SWE). Non-FAANG will gleefully cargo-cult those practices. Today, if an interviewer forced a different language on me I would terminate the interview immediately. Those interviewers are the types of people that believe an interview is the place where they go to get their ego satisfied by showing you how much smarter they are than you. That is, of course, not the point of an interview - it's to determine your skills via signal you can demonstrate, and mutual sales. To pass their interviews, you essentially have to demonstrate \_their\_ thinking, and they may also be mediocre thinkers - it's almost as if you would have to remind them of themselves before they got so awesome. I've had a few of these types of interviews - including one where I now am at - and my mistake was using my own approach. I was literally told I was doing things the wrong way - when my approach was at least as good or better then the gold standard they were trying to measure me against. It's felt really good the past few years to ignore their recruiters - thirsty as hell for the idea of me working there. I've given a few interviews now - and forcing Java on a Python person is a rookie mistake that would indict the interviewer's skill. Apple once literally laughed at me for not knowing what the "static" keyword in C (not C++) did - which is not a problem because it is a completely irrelevant feature of C. It made me feel like absolute dogshit at the time, until 10 minutes later I googled it and revealed that my interviewer was a dumbfuck, and therefore I dodged a bullet by not having to work with a dumbfuck like that ("mutual sales")
How "magic" is this?
&gt;Especially ones that have the necessary soft skills to manage and mentor others. Exactly, I know that I'm not the most talented developer on my team - and I don't have a CS background to back some technicalities as well. But my attitude towards problem solving and taking ownership/initiative are way more appreciated by everyone, from management to the really exceptional devs that know 10x what I do. Interesting enough I was quite frontal on the interview about not being a coder, but a problem solver, and I'm happy that the role gave ample room for this. I am lucky enough to work on an amazing team though, where everyone is really helpful and values opinion and group cohesion, so if something is above my capabilities I can openly discuss with anyone, and everyone has the same attitude. 
First go to your roof, then find a window, then open the window, then dive out of your house.
Don't give up pal! 1 interview is fuck all. I am currently working as a it security consultant. I have wanted to be in the area for years. I hated studying but made it to uni, failed about 10 interviews. Applied over 100-200 times. Re studied what I wanted to get into several times. 1) even if you feel ready understand that a technic interview is there to see the extent of your level. They will push way past the basic requirements, to test potential, interest and analytical thinking. 2) Do some free online programming courses and do projects. 3)reaply and don't give up! 
Lots of good advice in the comments here, but just to add my two cents: you don’t want to work for a company that conducts its interviews like that. Nobody does well in their first technical interview. Mine was a disaster. It happens to everyone. You didn’t waste your time; you got some great insight into how this company hires engineers. Based on that insight, you should look elsewhere for your first engineering job. Regardless of your skill level and how you performed, your description of the process tells me that they don’t know how to conduct interviews. If they don’t know how to conduct interviews, how can they possibly be doing a good job of hiring? And if they aren’t, that’s certainly not a place you want to work, much less seek mentorship or build your career. The purpose of a (good) technical interview is to assess the candidate’s problem-solving ability. It’s *not* about how well you can regurgitate some solution you’ve memorized beforehand. If it feels like a candidate has seen a particular question before, I’ll give them something else. I’m trying to get a sense for your critical thinking skills, how well you communicate, and whether you’re able to ask good questions along the way – I can’t do this if you’re not grappling with something you’ve never seen before. You don’t have to come up with the best, most optimal solution ever devised (although, bonus points if you do). The best candidates are articulate and unafraid to admit when they’re stuck or don’t know something. Asking for help is something you’re going to do every day if you become an engineer. It’s not a sign of weakness or stupidity; it shows me that you know what you don’t know. So – if you still want to do this, here are some action items: 1. Buy yourself a copy of *Cracking the Coding Interview, 6th Edition* by Gale Laakmann McDowell (available on Amazon). The only way to get better dealing with problems you’ve never seen before is to practice. A lot. 2. Never, ever, *ever* pretend to understand something you don’t. This is the only thing in your post that leapt out as a red flag to me. Consider how it looks from the interviewer’s perspective. It’s obvious when it’s happening, and someone who is inclined to do it in an interview may very well do the same on the job. That’s not good for anyone. Instead, ask for help! Ask as many questions as you need to in order to clarify. This is just as important as coming up with a working solution. 3. Try to find someone(s) to mock interview you. Most software engineers have a favorite interview question or two up their sleeve, or you can just have them ask you something out of *Cracking the Coding Interview*. Practicing on your own is one thing; sitting across from someone, working under a time limit is something else entirely. Practice on a whiteboard too, if you can find one. 4. Take a deep breath. You’re in the fortunate position of already having a job, which means you can take as much time as you need in order to make this transition. Technical interviews are really different from most other kinds, and can be really daunting if you’ve never done them before. Feel free to PM me if you have any questions or just want to discuss further. Good luck! Keep your chin up.

Thats so me, when people ask me what i listen its hard to answer becouse to range its so big aas long as it doesnt have a lot of lyrics its fine for me hahahah
None at all. For around four or five years I worked in an office where we played music out-loud. I basically found it a distraction, but in an odd way. I get really strong "flow" (sort of like a hyper-concentration/focus) when programming/problem solving. I almost completely shut-out the world around me, and part of that is that I can't hear much.. to the point that I can't hear my colleagues sitting next to me calling me unless they do something unusual (i.e. shout with alarm in their voice, but usually they just tap me). So really I don't hear the music much.. but then when you drop out of that flow, the music kicks right-back in and to me it sounds like someone's just turned the music on mid-album and track - and that's quite annoying as it's a bit of a distraction. You never really get to enjoy the album/track either. In the end, I prefer to do programming XOR listen to and enjoy some music.
FFS! One interview and you want to give up?! I'll tell you exactly where you went wrong. You expected to be good at something the first time you tried it. Interviewing is a skill. It takes some time to be good at it. Did you walk the first time you tried? Did you manage to catch a ball the first time? No, you'd have fallen over or dropped the ball, but at that age we just try again. Learn from the experience. Do better next time. Go on more interviews... lots of interviews.... even some interviews where you don't even want the job. Play with them, learn from them, get better at them.

This whole thing cuts both ways. Quite. often a company will ask its IT department heads to set interview questions, and they end up with thise ridiculous Krypton Factor interviews. In my own experience, I recall setting a basic technical interview for a BI consultant + SQL developer, and had so many candidates that couldn't even order the clauses. A good interview will have a broad mix of questions much like an IQ test: some simple to establish basics, many shades inbetween and some almost impossible, or very niche to sort people into flavours. If the interviewer insists on walking people through all the answers, that process will bloat to ridiculous level. Those guys need training.

Don't give up, it's just a single interview and poorly conducted at that. Though lots of interviews involve solving some kind of algorithmic problems either during the on-site part or during the screening process. If you have a couple of months, work through problems in "Cracking the coding interview" book and you'll be ready for these kinds of interviews. Generally, some companies expect their employees to have a traditional CS background even if the job is about implementing some boring Web service and some ask only some application development related question (how would you design a database, what tools would you use to solve a specific task etc).
Nothing, it bothers me when I am thinking

Well, tbh, just knowing a language can't lend you a programming gig. A programming language helps you *implement* your solution for a given problem. But you need to come up with a solution in the first place. That is what really matters. Translating that solution into code just requires the knowledge of syntax and semantics of the language, which isn't a big deal.

Usually hours of [anime](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAPhMJb-LIU) soundtracks like this ones. Relaxing, calm, easy to listen. I could tolerate anything except techno. I hate that with a passion.
I sit in absolute silence... But when I am not coding I listen to rap... Emin3m to be precise...

EDM or death metal, something where there’s not a lot of (understandable) words
I agree with no lyrics! But listen to Cool Jazz, like Miles Davis Kind of Blue, or some Dave Brubeck. 
Ohh, don't do that. SQL wasn't meant to store data that way. What you need to do is to map the data from your jsons into temporary dictionaries/tuples and then send those to SQLite.
Classical music with noise cancelling headphones. There's great piano covers of anime openings that I usually listen as well. A great example: https://youtu.be/sEQf5lcnj_o
Try fluent python
Haha that explains why I can't find anything online lol, just would be easier if I could dump the JSON and have it remain valid for future use. Suppose it will have to be a CSV or similar for each exchange. 
Old school reggae
Epic instrumental - I've started from listening to Audiomachine and then discovered more similar artists through Spotify. As for many other people, songs with words distract me. When I get tired of it, I either switch to melodic metal like Amorphis or even electro metal like Crossfaith. When I really want to focus, I switch to - Forest sounds" or something like that (there is an artist on Spotify). Also, noise canceling headphones were one of my best buys for work. 
Yes, CSV is also a good format to store your data. Python also has a built in module to save to csv. But you will also require to manually specify which fields of your json to save. If you want to save the JSON as-is, then take a look at MongoDB and PyMongo.

It's more which ones lower on resources as I'm purposefully limiting myself to using the pi to make it as efficient as possible, I was hoping to dump the JSON as that would use very little resources but if the packages to do this are too heavy I'll have to go down the CSV route. Cheers again pal, I'd still be reading instead of doing if you hadn't offered advice. 👍
Music to code by, from Carl Franklin (dot net rocks podcast host) is good stuff, they're all palmadoro (sp ?) length tracks, no lyrics
Hans Zimmer scores have contributed to all of my most epic code.

As /u/Kbhusain has already mentioned, I can highly recommend [Fluent Python](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920032519.do) - it's a really great book for someone in your position. I've found digging into the [Python source](https://github.com/python/cpython) very informative; the libraries in-particular are a great place to start. I dug into them to see how their async IO system was implemented, and I found that very educational so have looked into all sorts of things now. PyCon presentations are often really great (this is true for any tech/subject actually, their conference talks are usually very good - be it Python, Blender, Black Hat, etc.) Their YouTube channels are somewhat disorganised, but you can see [PyCon 2018 here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsX05-2sVSH7Nx3zuk3NYuQ) and follow the recommended channels/videos for more. Whoever looks after their slide distribution is [much more organised](https://github.com/PyCon). [PEPs](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/) are really interesting, and you can follow some of the proposals, or go-over some of those that made it in. For example, coming from a more strongly-typed background, I was surprised to learn that python doesn't come with a Database Abstraction Layer, but does have a specification for one which they all (seem to) implement - which gave me some key insights into Python's philosophy. The Python-Dev [group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/dev-python) / [mailing list](https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/python-dev) really gives you a detailed insight into the work that's going on with the language / libraries and the design philosophies of the python developers.

Either techno/EDM with no lyrics or classic rock/rap playlists with songs I’ve heard 100’s of times so the lyrics aren’t a distraction
I am currently reading this one and so far I like it. 
I have 2 Twitch streamers that I always watch. They usually play casual games with some chill lo-fi music in the background.
&gt; keep shooting until you hit one For a second I thought this was r/seduction :)
I really like this book but the example which is used in it so hard to understand.
What are you goals?
Made a discord bot for the original Guild Wars game to display skill tenplates! Was kindof fun and a good exercise working with bit encoding / decoding, web scraping, and some image manipulation! I might put it on github if people wana see it later :)
&gt; Venezuela, you can make mid 6 there. What you did there? I'm seeing it...
Check out vexento on youtube! Quite chill music that is good background noise for concentrating. Only songs have lyrics, but I skip them. He has his songs organized into playlists too
Whitesnake
I heard you were offering a job? Haha
Maybe the reason is because English is not my native language. I can understand the purpose of the author in specific contents. Just can't understand the example. I will try to read again. Last time, I dropped at "Class" section.

Good read, I like the Validation part. I honestly never thought to use them as a validating wrapper but it makes sense. Thanks for sharing!
Then you should take a look at [RESTful Authentication with Flask](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/restful-authentication-with-flask) by Miguel Grinberg as well. :)
Acid techno
I love some real fast-going rock. But when I come across an issue or something I really need to focus on, I will pause the music for a moment until I am going hard again.
There's no indentation! That alone makes this a really poor reference for beginners.

Every interview is an opportunity for you to learn. That's not pick-me-up bullshit, it's reality. It's ok to be bummed, but see it as a resource and not a failure. Now you know where to focus.
Oh I always feel bad.
Why not go with the [football-data](https://www.football-data.org/) API instead?

Well, there are only 3 parts of the module (all 3 are documented) you should read. (Well 4, if you include the module-level sets of magic methods at the top.) It is pretty magic, because it implicitly converts references of self to self.queen. However, this is an explicit conversion with @assimilated classes, as you can use @resist on a method to prevent that from happening. The only reason you'd want to do that is if you wanted to evaluate the hash or equality of two instances of the de facto class instead of two borg pods (which override equality and hash to maintain consistency with hash map lookups.) For many, the idea of redirecting calls of magic methods is not possible - because traditionally you can't control their access with __getattribute___, but this introduces a few new ways with decorators. It's really not a long module, and there are use cases and examples inside. It's all one file inside /borg_pod/ besides __init__.py.
Pink floyd or Ludovico Einaudi
I just wanted to share it since, for me, Corey is the best Python teacher on youtube and I really learned a lot from them.
Really anything by David Beazley is interesting. If YouTube videos are your thing, I'd really suggest you look into his talks. Usually he's doing something ridiculous, but he dives into the details enough that you always learn something. Same thing with James Powell, Joe Jevnik, and a couple of others.
/r/wavepool
There's a lot more to this than just changing classes! Changing __class__ will give you access to the class's methods, but we're also interested in all the other aspects of class and inspections which aren't changed with editing __class__. I would point you towards posts and talks on how changing __class__ actually more tightly couples the two implementations instead of decoupling them. You can find such discussions by googling the actions you described. This is entirely general: new and init are both called to instance the correct variables, and the class methods (effectively) act on an actual instance of that class,
Oh yeah and if you read the documentation for @assimilate in /borg_pod/theonlyotherfilebesidesinit.py, there's a real world CV use case at the bottom of @assimilate's documentation.
&gt; If you don't know how to use a hash table, I'll teach you. This is the point I'm getting at. Not every employer wants to teach you how to use a hashmap or a modulo. Sometimes, employers want/need you to have a base level of knowledge, and there isn't anything wrong with that. For instance. I do a lot of Python, C#, and occasionally Lua. If I went to interview at a place that uses exclusively C++, it would be totally valid for them to ask me how to dereference a pointer or about templates. Those are things anyone could answer with a few seconds access to google, but if you don't know how to dereference a pointer or what a template is, you probably don't know when to use them either, which is useful information. Maybe this company doesn't want to teach me to template or pointers. I just don't think it's unreasonable to want entry level employees to be familiar with the tech you use. Maybe OP interviewed at a company that makes grid based video board games, and they use modulo all the time to convert from pixel coordinates.
No man's sky sound track 
Sign up for a community college class in discrete mathematics or just grab a book on the subject and self study. That kind of class should help you significantly with starting to gain the right kind of intuition for this kind of problem solving. 
As everyone had said here already, Fluent Python is phenomenal. High Performance Python is another great book, if you're interested in making your code more performant.
wow really good read. the aspect of logging performance data thru decorators is great. always hate adding redundant debug statements to functions

It's just like any spoken language, if you don't use it you won't speak it. Look at the "collections" library and look for videos from Raymond Hettinger. He wrote that.

Nothing. How could I hear the voices in my head calling me a dumbass otherwise?
Same thing.
A valuable software **engineer** is someone who has strong engineering basis in a lot of categories, and to name a few: * maths * physics * linear algebra * signal processing * problem solving * fast adaptation * imagination, out of the box thinking These fields of science all give you different ways to approach the same problem, either that's part of your interview, or your job. Knowing a programming language is something that anyone can do, after they have all of the above. In short, if you want to get a software engineering job, **focus on the engineering part first**. In my humble opinion, don't give up, invest some time on these categories, and everything will click.
Run the Jewels and Death Grips on repeat.
Try those if a in [1, 2] if a in range(4, 50)
For your first issue: if a in (1,2):
So how would we do this? if a == 1 or b == 2: # if a is equal to 1 # or b is equal to 2 With your method this could be interpreted as: if a == 1 or a == b == 2: if a is equal to 1 or a is equal to b which is also equal to 2
Maybe it works but this sort of thing is like taking a class to get a grade instead of to learn. Like if you can game the interviewer with what you learn in this book... They're a shit interviewer. I'd say 9/10 times I know whether I'll accept a candidate just by chatting with them for 10 minutes. The actually technical questions usually just confirm my initial thoughts.
Metal, punk, and pod-casts.
Metal, trouble is sometimes I'll get carried away and just sing along. But I honestly find my thought process is much clearer when I'm listening to music and am generally much more productive
`if a == 1 or 2:` would always be true
His first day of work was \~2-3 months after my last interview with him. He looked like a different person... he was taller, younger, lighter complexion, and different hair. I think through conversation one of my colleagues found out he had an older brother that worked in a similar role. So we put 2 and 2 together that his brother did the interviews. We were looking for someone that was junior/senior level and this guy didn't know anything. We reviewed our interview questions and there was no way the guy who showed up on Wednesday and Thursday would have been able to answer them. I've read stories about stuff like this, but I always thought it was like a joke.
Great article. I'm definitely going to use decorators for logging. I have a question. Let's say we have: @logging def func_(): pass Is it possible to call *func_* without the executing the logic in the *logging decorator*? For example the decorator logic would be useful in development, but we may want to toggle it off during production.
I really like the Shadowrun OST (Returns, Dragonfall and Hong Kong).

Thanks for the kind words and for sharing the course! I hope you find it helpful. I’ll be adding more to the course once I get back from visiting some family for a couple of weeks. 
For the larger groups `set(range(4, 50))` would be more efficient. Set literals like `{1,2}` can similarly be used, but may not be more efficient for small cardinalities.
OP could also define a class Or, which holds a collection of values and overrides all the comparison operations to return true if they hold for *any* of the collection. So `a == Or(1, 2)` would work. And perhaps even `And(λx:x&gt;3, λx:x&lt;50)(a)`. Not that they should do this, of course. 
Stuff like Irving Force, https://open.spotify.com/track/1QAYmj9ALwaMTizJVq2Yu2?si=3Q_OFxyoQqKmvjPkUjXxxA.
Won't constructing a set make range enumerate its members, which the `__contains__` method of a range object is designed to avoid?
Does YouTube dl not do this?
Everyone's getting merge privileges on the main repo, for a truly democratic way forward.
You're right, if the range is constructed each time then `set` doesn't buy you anything since it enumerates the range. I wasn't aware that range has a special `__contains__` method, but it makes sense.
One of the many lovely gifts of Python3 (well, I guess python2's xrange had it too). The [`__contains__` code ](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Objects/rangeobject.c#L338) is pretty nice, so it does the whole check in a few hundred nanoseconds.

I've been trying to make an aimbot for http://www.aimbooster.com/ but can't really decide what modules to use, or the path of action to take. I see two ways: I take a picture of a target and subtract everything except for the target and then save the pixels for the program to recognize, or find a way for python to identify the color of the center of the target, and find the targets that way. Any ideas would be helpful!

Can you provide a concrete example of a problem this solves? In the form of code. Even something highly reductionist that showcases your approach would be very useful to understand why one might want to use this instead of alternative approaches. The reason I say this is that I can imagine a number of possible ways of doing what you are doing without any decorator magic. However, it is entirely possible I'm ignorant to some specific requirements that you work with. An example would lay that to rest. &amp;#x200B;
Hey man you seriously are one of if not the best programming teachers I’ve found on the internet. If there’s a module in Python that I want to better understand I watch your video on it. In fact, your video on the sqlite3 module has inspired me to write my own password manager, easily one of the most complex projects I’ve ever attempted. Keep up the awesome work!

You don't want to add it as an environment variable, you want to edit the environment variable named "Path" and add Python's path to the end of it.
Change `beans = int(str)` into `beans = input(str)` and `if "Yes"` into `if beans == "Yes"` and `if no` into `elif beans == "No"`. You can't have 3 options like that without elif. Also, that `if "1"` also doesn't make real sense, I think. But I don't know what it's meant to do. Just know it's the same as if it didn't exist.
Bad indentation. beans= should be same indentation as newfile=. 
Thanks for sharing! I was just looking for a reason for Django.

Awesome dude keep up the good work! I really hope I can get better at tagging too, it would make automating office work so much easier in the online databases we use, but so many of the elements are obfuscated or non-linearly indexed. Does anyone have any suggestions or material they can share with me to still be able to assign functions to them, or even just material on creating effective python scripts for web apis that require authentication? Would appreciate it tons!
Hi!, 1. The indentation is wrong in "beans = ..." 2. The "if" is wrong, you need to compare something (like variable=="value" for example) 3. The second "if" need to be "else if". If not, everytime after the "Yes" the function is called again. 4. I guess, if you like think in your exercise in the real world, you need to add a "return something" for know what you finally do, and maybe this is not a good example for a recursive method. You can use a loop ("while True... if ok: break) and force a exit if the user like cancel or a error is repeated. &amp;#x200B; Enjoy learning!.
Turtle is only as slow as you make it https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/turtle.html#turtle.speed https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/turtle.html#turtle.tracer I used turtle to make a graphics engine rendering symbols for data in a simple array. There was a little lag, but it was drawing a whole levels worth of content for every keypress. Turtle can actually go VERY fast.
Go search for and watch all the PyCon tutorials and presentations by Raymond Hettinger and David Beasely. 
Speed will take you only so far. The fast stuff is in the tracer function.
1. /r/learnpython 2. Don't share code with images 3. *Obviously* it's going to help us to know what your code is supposed to do, and what it's actually doing. 4. Your indentation is wrong, everything from `beans` down to the end of the `else` block needs to be back one level 5. You're calling `int()` on a string which isn't a representation of an integer 6. Non-empty strings are always truthy (`bool("whatever") == True`); you want `if beans == "Yes"`. But also you don't want to call that variable `beans` 6. You probably want to iterate rather than recurse but this will probably work
This is OK. It's because Python closes when your code is finished running. Try running this: &amp;#x200B; import time for i in range(5): time.sleep(1) print(i) &amp;#x200B; Then this: import time for i in range(5): time.sleep(1) print(i) &amp;#x200B; input('Type anything to leave: ') 
Do the tools run on the server or locally on each machine?
Its not all about the speed of the turtle, you need to adjust the regularity and delay of screen refreshes.
I deleted the comment because you 'already knew about this' and I didnt want to clutter up the internet with redundant information. Oh whats that? Your turtle is still slow? Maybe you didnt already 'know' it after all.
try putting turtle.tracer(1000,20) at the top of your script
This is how all programs work, they close when they're finished running. Before long you will probably learn how to put your code into a main loop that keeps running until you're finished with it.
Here’s what I think: There’s no getting around the need for a database. Resorting to JSON means you are just using a really crappy and less reliable database. The only alternative would be saving data locally and making it possible for the farm controller to pull the data from each machine, but that’s going to **cost them a lot more time and money**, and probably be *less reliable* than just letting you use a small Postgres database on the server. I think you just need to argue for the server capabilities you need to keep the servers running. 
Plotly is also a good plotting library
Nobody uses CGI scripts anymore because they suck compared to Flask or Django. I think I used it back in the 90s at some point with Perl or something, but I honestly have no idea how you’d do it today. It’s really a question about Apache, not Python. 
Hi there, from the /r/Python mods. We have removed this post as it is not suited to the /r/Python subreddit proper, however it should be very appropriate for our sister subreddit /r/LearnPython or for the r/Python discord: https://discord.gg/3Abzge7. The reason for the removal is that /r/Python is dedicated to discussion of Python news, projects, uses and debates. It is not designed to act as Q&amp;A or FAQ board. The regular community is not a fan of "how do I..." questions, so you will not get the best responses over here. On /r/LearnPython the community and the r/Python discord are actively expecting questions and are looking to help. You can expect far more understanding, encouraging and insightful responses over there. **No matter what level of question you have, if you are looking for help with Python, you should get good answers**. Make sure to check out the rules for both places. Warm regards, and best of luck with your Pythoneering!
This is a culture problem. Tread lightly, but you probably need SQL.
I love reading these stories. Solve this really easy problem, but do it in the stupidest, hardest way possible. My condolences on your horrible working environment :(
Fluent Python is one of my favorites.
The apache scriptalias directive lets you define an alias for a url to go to a scripts directory, commonly cgi-bin. Then you use /cgi-bin/somepath/yourscript.py as the action. 
Nothing, I think the core committers at best agreed to delay, which is bad news.
Thanks for the resources. 
That doesn't sound so bad. I think you've struck on the right idea with having 1 file per user, you just need a file format with less syntax than json. How about having your client-side tool generate a username.csv without headers: 180901,bob-desktop,include and ftp it to your server in a fixed directory with all other users. Then your server can simply `cat *.csv &gt;schedule.csv` every 15 minutes.
This question requires way, way too much context for anyone here to have any hope of helping you answer it. You also included the **sbatch** script (which is slurm-specific) instead of anything to do with the python code. The answer is going to depend on what the node hardware looks like, what the workload looks like, and (a little) on what the python code doing the task looks like. The slowness you are experiencing could be due to IO or RAM bottlenecks, an squeue scheduling or throttling issue, how you decomposed it, ... any number of things, and most of them are not python related. If you have co-workers on the slurm cluster who are more knowledgeable about slurm than you and have some understanding of the workload, you should probably ask them.
Haha, well, there's a few reasons I left it as the eye-gouge that I did. 1. The question is half-trolling, half-a-sanity-check on my part. 2. The code is meant to be readable because it's going in an essay for my philosophy instructor, who is not a programmer. 3. I'm specifically referencing a recent media scandal in which someone said "truth isn't truth." I wanted to claim that "x isn't x" is never a true statement and demonstrate it programatically, but then I got caught up with breaking my own rule.
Since you mention the ESP8266 and you say the coding side confuses then you should start playing around with the ESP8266 in an Arduino environment and get used to programming it in C/C++. The [second step in the "Setup and Configuration"](https://github.com/scottlawsonbc/audio-reactive-led-strip#setup-and-configuration) of the GutHub project leads you through that. The only differonce I can think of is you have to select your actual ESP8266 board in the "Selecting the ESP8266 Thing Board" step rather than the SparkFun board. Once you have done that search for tutorials on connecting an LED to your board and getting the "blink" sketch running. Then you might go on to controlling your LED strip. Again, search for tutorials. Then you might try continuing the GitHub project which, as far as I can tell without actually doing it, looks reasonably complete. You can ask questions about the ESP8266 on /r/esp8266/.
An easy answer would be ... [spoiler](/s float('nan'))
I see. So are you saying you don't have a solution? &gt;!Here is \[the one I was thinking of\](https://i.imgur.com/3C5eTQb.jpg) in Python 3.3. (I thought it was 2.7.9 but I was mistaken). I can't replicate in 3.7 though.!&lt;
Oh wow! Also, I didn't when I asked, but now I have two solutions (that work in all versions of Python afaik).
I very much doubt the first is possible for recent Python versions, without outright corrupting the execution environment. I checked the source and there aren't any hooks. You load the same address onto the stack twice, and check if they're equal pointers.
When you upload an audio file to SoundCloud, it gets copied and converted into a 128 kbps file for streaming. Scripts like this just pull *that* audio file, *not* the source file (which is not accessible). So, no, that is not possible until SoundCloud increases their streaming resolution, which probably won't happen any time soon. 
I thought the same but Terr_ posted a really interesting answer in their spoiler.
Nope, that isn't a solution. &gt;&gt;&gt; def thing_is_thing(thing): ... if thing is not thing: ... return False ... if thing is thing: ... return True ... &gt;&gt;&gt; thing_is_thing(float('nan')) True 
Oh, damn, you're right. I was also playing with == and != comparison operators and forgot to change them back... :c
That's different; you're saying that two different literals might have different addresses. In Python 3.7 the constant folding improves, so those two constants when defined on the same line get interned and deduplicated, which is why it changed. But if you pass it to `thing_is_thing`, none of this matters. You'll always get `True`.
One at a time. I am not yet there, I am in IT now but I am leaning towards the opinion that there's really no end to this. I am 27 now, 3 years ago I was doing insulin batches. 1 year ago I was rack/stack guy to systems integrator (sysadmin/netsec) I knew then thatI wasn't happy because I wanted to learn more. I wanted to appreciate what devs are doing to the servers I provision and maintain for them. The only thing I think age is important is HR screening you for the job.

Where are you attempting to convert to float ? 
Basically I'm getting an error: TypeError: Image data cannot be converted to float &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
Which line ?
wait what is this &amp;#x200B;
shoot, misread what you wrote (read it as why). I was converting it float using: img3= float(img3) &amp;#x200B; but after that I got a completely different error: TypeError: float() argument must be a string or a number, not 'NoneType'
For extra evil: class OhFuck: def __eq__(self, other): return other.__eq__(self)
```&gt;&gt;&gt; x = OhFuck() &gt;&gt;&gt; x is x True &gt;&gt;&gt; x == x Traceback (most recent call last): File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt; File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 3, in __eq__ File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 3, in __eq__ File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 3, in __eq__ [Previous line repeated 994 more times] RecursionError: maximum recursion depth exceeded &gt;&gt;&gt; x != x Traceback (most recent call last): File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt; File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 3, in __eq__ File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 3, in __eq__ File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 3, in __eq__ [Previous line repeated 993 more times] RecursionError: maximum recursion depth exceeded &gt;&gt;&gt; ```
Thanks for your reply, that is really motivating
Ah you were right, img 3 was = None in that case, how would I get an image output \[kind of like this: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UquTAf\_9dVA&amp;index=14&amp;list=PLQVvvaa0QuDdttJXlLtAJxJetJcqmqlQq](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UquTAf_9dVA&amp;index=14&amp;list=PLQVvvaa0QuDdttJXlLtAJxJetJcqmqlQq) (5:12)\]
Right, that's one kind of evil. The other kind occurs when you compare it to a normal object, because it violates the symmetric property.
The type error tells you this ! Basically it says " you can't take the float of nothing " 
You have to debug systematically. Make sure p1 and p2 are as you expect. 
Know what you want and the consequences of failing to achieve it. 
Can you give me an example? I tried to compare it to a random object, tried both operators, and tried both configurations x == y / y == x, but the behavior seemed pretty consistent.
thanks I'll give it a shot
You posted this same thing two days ago: https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/9bpzqo/can_someone_make_an_edgenuity_python/
If you're on the Django learning path, eventually it's a good idea to try to contribute to an actual project. May I humbly suggest then to those interested, check out [wger: a self hosted FLOSS fitness/workout and weight tracker written with Django](https://github.com/wger-project/wger/).
Some guy on Discord made this. It's technically cheating since it uses a wrapper but it's still really interesting. https://paste.pydis.com/aqevuqeduv.py
Well,now it's more in depth and theirs log in info for someone who wants to do it. And to top it off,you couldn't even do it without logging in.
I hear a blond orange-colored old guy is muttering shit like "Make Python great again" 
Well, here's the problem: the interviewer has to, basically, predict the future, and they have to do it based on like what... half an hour they spend knowing you as a candidate? One obvious problem with this is that this is definitely not enough time, second, less obvious problem with this is that interviewers themselves went through this flawed process as did all of her peers. So, you basically get assessed by random people for random standards with a lot of randomness in assessment itself. Now, you've been given some tricky questions. No. They aren't testing your IQ. They are, basically, testing if you have been interviewing for long enough to memorize the answers. Very few people and only very rarely can come up with even basic algorithms on their own in the very short time-frame of an interview. I don't believe Hoare would have invented quicksort if he was given this as an interview question and had only some 15 minutes to answer it. --- While all of this looks very grim, think about the times, like a decade or so ago, when the fashion for programming interviews was slightly different: they would often hire a psychologist to perform this duty. I have a bunch of stories of having to work through these interviews. ;) --- What I think the system should be like: I actually like it how things are done in hospitals. When you apply for residency, you don't go and interview with the head of the department and such; instead, you ask them to be allowed to participate in their daily work for some time. Probably a few months. People working in the department get used to you, get a better idea of what you are capable of etc. and *then* you get to interview with people making a decision. Of course it's painfully slow and expensive. Some people spend several years before they start residency, but, the system overall makes a lot more sense.

The state of the art way to do this is object classification based on convolutional neural networks. Look into AlexNet or Faster R-CNN to see what is possible. 
Any reason for the MIT license?

BTW, how long did you work in Python? My main major is not programming, just try Python because I feel interested in it. Do you mind if we could discuss more about Python or some expanded topics around technical?

 I don't think determining whether or not an arbitrary object in an image is recyclable is as easy a problem as you think it is. Contrast- size- orientation - small differences - shadows: show me a database lookup solution with greater than 90% accuracy and I'll give you $100
 if img1 == img2: return True There you go. \/s I never said it is easy. I said you are making it ultra complicating by bringing a neural network just because. There are plenty of frameworks that do this for you already with highly accuracy without a need to train a model. Plus I 100% know you won't pay for it, so I won't even entertain the offer. 
If SQL is an issue why note use NoSQL like MongoDB/Redis. DB is mostly used for storage and retrieval. [PyMongo](https://api.mongodb.com/python/current/) is a good library I know of which can help. Add in a bit of [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) to the mix and you should be good to go. 
I am 29, worked in game industry till 26 and moved to web dev, app dev as business analyst. 2 years ago I learned Python because of the raise of data job. Then I realized I kinda like programming. I want to learn more, I jump into Django, study about algorithm, Docker, Kubernetes ... A lot of thing that I want to learn. Sometime I feel like you. I really regret because I spent some years in game industry. But, according to my opinion, technology changes everyday, it's doesn't matter how old you are, as long as you could learn and catch up the new ones. You are OK. I am still learning everyday and I want to form a firm of Python for outsourcing and make product. It's never too late my friend.
But img1 would never be img2, even if taken with the same camera from the same position. I don't think you do much computer vision work. 
[Software Architecture with Python](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35040250-software-architecture-with-python) is a good book that covers organisational aspect of Software.

I’m 26 and I just switched fields entirely. Straight up told them I couldn’t do it straight away, and had to take a while t get up to speed and they believed I was smart enough to do it. 
Hey @corey! Thanks for great material to learn. Would you recommend for a start path Django or flask? Considering that learning a thing which provides more profit over time as you learn it? Cheers!
I would have each tool to have their own SQLite database locally, that maintains just their own schedule. That's their "master" copy, so to speak. So that's the user-side of it sorted to be exactly as it is now with very little effort/change to anyone no matter how you tell the server what's going on. That de-couples the user-side from your decisions going forward. Then you need to think about how you're going to tell the server what to do. So the simplest way would be to just FTP a file over every time a change is made on a client, that details the change that the client has made. You could do this in several ways: 1. It could be like a queue of change messages.. so the server script would read through each message in-turn, process it, then discard (move) it after it's been processed. 2. You could have one-file-per-day/machine as you suggest, and not having a file would be to indicate the default (say, include in farm) behaviour. Another option entirely.. that's sysadmin dependent.. have the farm controller query each machine as to whether it wants to be included on a given day. That could be done in a number of ways.. little socket server, file-share, or even by interacting with the renderfarm client on the machine in some way. I'd ask to have a meeting with your sysadmin team about the best way to do this. Explain the existing architecture, how that's clearly not viable anymore, than run through some options and see what they'd prefer you implemented.
I will. For now I know just that GOG has an API, that gives you list of all games, if I remember correctly.
The so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so guy &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; JK.
Yeah, and it might be faster with BeatifulSoup. Regex isn't really known for it's speed.
Seems like you may have uninstalled sklearn? Or changed environment
You should really get to know pep8, the code is a bit of a mess currently. Most code editors can be set up to check for pep8 automatically so it's easy to learn that way.
I started using pycharm but I never uninstalled sklearn
pycharm does usually create new environments with it's own dependencies. See if sklearn is installed in `File &gt; Settings &gt; Project: Name &gt; Project Interpreter`
^ thsi!
Why not have the script restart the service for you? Or, better still, use one of the many tools designed with keeping long running processes active in mind (systemd, for example)?
/u/ClownMayor This works like a charm. Also the hint you gave on the malformed input I had. One more thing to ask here. If I know for sure that `remove_dict` will always be smaller than `source_dict`, wouldn't it make more sense, to loop over `remove_dict` instead?
Because it being useful wasn't my primary goal.
True
Lol, fair enough then!
Works on 3.6.6 though. &gt;&gt;&gt; float('nan') is float('nan') False The `id`s are the same, though. So why does this happen?
This is the proper way to do it, but an alternative would be to download the pages in parallel using [aria2](https://aria2.github.io/) and then processing the downloaded files. And then you have all the content locally so you don't have to rescrape if you realise you missed something.
Those are different `float('nan')`; you instantiated it twice. The `id`s are not the same; if they were then they would compare equal with `is`.
Sorry what I meant to say was I've been using pycharm as of the past week, but I ran my code in Spyder today (which is what I initially used)
I think it's in memory by default (just like `int`s from -256 to 256). &gt;&gt;&gt; print(id(float('nan')), id(float('nan'))) 1906492776736 1906492776736 Different instances, same `id`. 
With all respect... Silly logic. Either you share the best solution to a problem, or you share something you made that might be useful in some case. This just sounds like laziness with an attitude like that. 
You are creating UI in Qt so I highly suggest you to use qtdesigner as a GUI to create the ui file.
This is different. Because you immediately call `id` on your first value, the reference count drops to 0 and it gets destroyed. The next float you make gets allocated in slot you just cleared out. &gt;&gt;&gt; print(id(float('nan')), id(float('nan'))) 140514529468728 140514529468728 &gt;&gt;&gt; f = float('nan'); print(id(f), id(float('nan'))) 140514529468728 140514529468536 
Oh, that makes sense, thanks! I wasn't aware of this.

scrapy is multi-process oriented and complex too use. As it's not an issue on parallel programming (CPU) but I/O you should consider this new paradigm with python: async/await: https://medium.freecodecamp.org/a-guide-to-asynchronous-programming-in-python-with-asyncio-232e2afa44f6 You now have an equivalent to "requests" which async/await support. Here is a example : https://pawelmhm.github.io/asyncio/python/aiohttp/2016/04/22/asyncio-aiohttp.html 
When you say FTP do you mean SFTP? Honestly either way, it’s a WTF, but if it’s insecure just go ahead and quit before these people give you brain damage. 
Very cool, albeit a bit too verbose. Why would one use it rather than latex? 
I think is a good idea but personally I don't like the implementation because of the [Rule of least power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_least_power)
I don't have enough hardware clue to tell you what kind of CPU to get; but as far as the "mobile or desktop" question is concerned: - mobile is less future proof and has a higher risk of premature death, so if you plan to keep the rig around for a while, and possibly upgrade as components become available / affordable, desktop is a better investment - there is a third option: beefy development server + commodity grade mobile workstation; and then you remote into the server from mobile. This way, the mobile part is expendable, and you still get the benefits of the desktop workstation.
 I am using the NodeMCU v3 Esp8266 board with some standard Ws2812b leds. My biggest concern is that I bought a power supply like [this](https://www.amazon.com/PHEVOS-Universal-Switching-Raspberry-Computer/dp/B074YHDFV3/ref=sr_1_10?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1535890996&amp;sr=8-10&amp;keywords=5v%2Bdc%2Bpower%2Bsupply&amp;th=1) instead of the wall outlet ones I see people using. I made it as far as successfully "uploading" this blink code in arduino IDE but my leds never lit up, I'm assuming I powered them incorrectly. 
Is your sklearn library fixed at a particular version? Otherwise you might be installing the latest version which would be different from when you first built the code. 
Been looking for something like this cheers
Any plans to publish to the jetbrains plugin repository?
Every year one of my students decides to attempt this game, so I thought I'd better get around to making a tutorial - finally had some free time today. Hope you get something useful out of it. Enjoy!
Orignally, I have used Beamer. But I was not happy about it, mainly, because of terrible error messages and hard scripting. Also I use many SVG images and I did not find a way to define partial revealing that can be setup directly in Inkscape.
I have that same board. I’m not familiar with the power requirements of those leds, but I suggest starting with just powering it from the USB cable and getting a basic LED going. The built-in led is on pin 16, so start with that to check your settings in the Arduino IDE. 
I could create a DSL, but I do not think that it is a good idea. I do not want to teach (as a creator) or learn (as a user) a new language. And it is always easy to miss an important feature. So a small DSL will grow and grow and it ends as Turing complete language, but with weird semantics, and weird syntax for less common cases. For example, let us name an evolution of PHP. Also in TeX (that is a completely different story), writing some basic scripts (loops, conditions) was quite a horrible experience for me. But using Python, you got all things for free, including tooling and many libraries.

What kind of computation do you anticipate you'll be doing?
I'd love to see some benchmarks for this sort of comparison. One way you could ballpark it yourself for your specific usage is calculate the performance gain that using Intel's optimisations give you, and see how that percentage difference compares to the difference in [CPU benchmarks](https://www.phoronix.com/). It's crude, yes, but would at least give you some insight. I'm looking at potentially switching from Intel to AMD with my next upgrade too.. all those fast cores is really tempting, as you suggest! If you do make the switch, please do report back with some numbers. I would personally stay away from workstation laptops unless you have a really specific use-case for them (i.e. you need to go and show people things running on decent hardware). I did so for years and I hated it.. you're often fighting things like under-clocking, they're big and heavy enough that I used to hate having to move it/lug it around, and they go out of date fast so are very cost inefficient. The intrinsic UPS of a laptop is nice though, I'd recommend investing in one.. that way things can wind down nicely and not fuck-up your data. I second the idea that having a decent "server" machine (be that your desktop at home/work, or hosted externally) and a thin mobile client (literally in this instance!) to talk to that elsewhere / on the move. How often don't you have access to the internet these days? It also means that you can leave things running 24/7 (and schedule things to use lower-cost power) which is nice.

Could you use sqlite in "memory" mode so it only writes to memory? I won't actually write anything to file/disk. 
Write only to FTP makes no sense when talking about an app that uses SQL.
Hmmm. The way you've constructed that won't work. newfile = 'something' msg = 'Are You Sure You Want To Call Your New File? '.format(newfile) shit = input(msg) print(shit) 
Is this what you wanted : shit = input("Are You Sure You Want To Call Your New File: " + newfile + "?") 
Yes, because it's a terrible idea. FTP is a server protocol for file access. You don't access a SQL db as a file, you access it via the server process and socket that it opens. The two are unrelated.
You could also use fstrings shit = f”Are you shure you want to name it {newfile}”
So maybe a dumb question - but if I'm comfortable with everything/most of that book, am I an expert? Is that all there is to know? It didn't cover performance much. (I did love the book though)
Formatting?
Wrote a simple guide that explains how to [concatenate values in Python](https://datatofish.com/concatenate-values-python/).

Not everything in the world 'just works'. I can see why you think the way you passed two arguments to input should work, because print works that way, but it doesn't work.
Hey Corey. Can you consider making a tutorial on CherryPy ? I've used it at work recently with great success. Its easy to use and has some great basic features, is very lightweight (compared to Django) while being totally extensible. I feel it needs more exposure and many folks can benefit from it. 
Generally speaking a laptop won't cut it for most people. At first, sure, but then if you ever run into something that's really CPU or GPU heavy you're kinda fucked, especially if you go the macbook route just due to poor hardware support when things break (and they will). Personally I'd just revamp your desktop and keep your mobile system as is, remoting into your desktop when necessary. &gt; My software already spawns a lot of parallel processes via dask/multiprocessing module, but I'm not touching the GIL, so threads are managed by Python and I don't care about them. You are touching it. You just don't know that you are. &gt; The problem is that I'm working with both int32 and float64, the code is not entirely parallelizable, so I need both cores and IPC. You may be able to gain more available power by changing your algorithms to be memory dependent via generators. &gt; The Intel support for Python is amazing with MKL, so I don't know if the cores number of Ryzen 7 / Threadrippers matters more than the optimization that I can get from MKL/AVX2-512. I can't say much for the specifics of threadripper, but the Ryzen line has been shown to be better than MKL when using OpenBLAS by around 22% on some calculations, and 10% worse on others (by some Julia users). Intel doesn't really have any ground in the space of competitive benchnarks in the desktop space anymore. The ryzen &amp; threadripper and ryzen2 &amp; threadripper2 lines were major hits against Intel that flew mostly under the radar because of PR moves. Threadripper 2 was shadowed by Intel's overclocking lightshow when in reality it was smoke and mirrors powered by an industrial cooler. But Threadripper2 was dollars to donuts what it was described as.
Will do. Thanks and sorry for the inconvenience.

I quite like it! One proposal... I would make a console script `elsie` that would render a python file into slides. It sounds better than to have the last line being `slides.render(some_file)`. It would make it importable.
I'm not so sure it is verbose? Drawing lines and rectangles etc is not really less code in LaTeX?
PyCharm’s PEP8 inspection feature and PyLint are very similar but they don't overlap completely so, if you use them both, you will catch more issues (just check the screenshots form the OP, you will see that PyCharm is not higlighting the same error as Mypy and PyLint). You can get the full list of issues here: [http://pylint-messages.wikidot.com/all-messages](http://pylint-messages.wikidot.com/all-messages) Mypy is more focused on static typing checks and, same as before, it doesn't overlap completely with PyCharm's checks.

Hi. I think you misunderstood what binary mode means when reading files &gt;Normally, files are opened in text mode, that means, you read and write strings from and to the file, which are encoded in a specific encoding. If encoding is not specified, the default is platform dependent (see open()). 'b' appended to the mode opens the file in binary mode: now the data is read and written in the form of bytes objects. This mode should be used for all files that don’t contain text. &gt; &gt;In text mode, the default when reading is to convert platform-specific line endings (\n on Unix, \r\n on Windows) to just \n. When writing in text mode, the default is to convert occurrences of \n back to platform-specific line endings. This behind-the-scenes modification to file data is fine for text files, but will corrupt binary data like that in JPEG or EXE files. Be very careful to use binary mode when reading and writing such files. ([Source](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html)) To get 1s and 0s (for whatever reason) I think you would need to read bytes in binary mode and then convert these bytes into 1s and 0s. There are better ways to do that, but as a quick hack you could use the [bin() built-in function ](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html) for the conversion. 
&gt;&gt; I feel like starting a Python dev career at 23 is late No, absolutely not. Where did you get this idea from ? I'm over 40 and I started learning and using python in my early thirties. There is no age barrier to learning a programming language. It all depends on the time and effort you put in and at your age you have plenty of time. Start early and keep practicing. 
Thanks, it did what I wanted :)

Not sure if I understand the constraints here properly. If your application under no circumstances allowed to write to the local file system? That can make sense in the modern application world, but that implies you have some external infrastructure to store things. FTP sounds like an odd choice.

Thank you for proposals! - I do not see benefits from creating an extra script except removing an extra line. What you mean that it would be not portable? - Function list_item is exposed; it defined in the example script and it can be simply modified to enum. But it is a good idea to create a package with some common elements like bullet points and enumerations. In example, I want to demonstrate that it is simple to create own bullet points that can be simply customized to user's needs. - For sake of simplicity, I have tried to avoid parameters that can be simply implemented by user if necessary. However, my colleague already asked me for this parameter, so I am going to add it:)
This is more of an Apache web server question than a python quesiton
Pylint is great but I usually prefer flake8. Nice job. 
The 1st thing to do is put "Please" as the first word of your title. The 2nd thing to do is take the whole mess over to r/LearnPython.
I’m sorry if the title sounded rude but no need to call me a mess mate.
I was referring to your question, not you.
You might need to change your virtual environment if running it in Spyder. It works in PyCharm because the software keeps track of virtual environments for your, which Spyder does not if I recall correctly.
Actually its both. But I think I got the apache part of it. So I'll re-post in python.
You should write your bot to handle that without crashing. It's very simple to do so. As to *how* you do that it depends on the details of how your bot is written. Your solution is akin to someone creating an elaborate system of pulleys and mattresses to cushion the blow of their car hitting the car in front of them without realizing they could instead just apply the brakes.
Thank you. It should not be too difficult to create also a flake8 plugin. If more people are interested I might consider doing it.
I do many Kodi addons and all of them are legit. This is my twitter: @TwilightZer0 and my repositories: https://github.com/Twilight0?tab=repositories. My addons are targeted primarily towards greek users, but I do have international ones such as the euronews addon.
Thanks, that's kinf of what I was looking for. I've been looking at this problem for some time. And there are several 'opinions' on how to do it. Like.... See the this next post/reply following yours. I've run across suggestions on putting it in other directories like www, opt, etc. - has a better security measure, but they were kind of vague (still is maybe). Yup, everybody uses flask or django - I already knew that.
Curious as to what you mean by better ways than \`bin()\`?
PyLint plugin just got approved by JetBrain: [https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/11084-pylint](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/11084-pylint)
Ah cool! I installed it before anyway but this just means I can keep it all up and running on all my machines easily.
I'm not sure, but if OP wanted it as an integer rather than a string, would it be better to do use some bit shifting on the byte? 
Glad to hear that. If you find some time please consider rating the plugin on [Jetbrains website](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/11084-pylint).
I would be among its users!
Thanks, but I'm trying PyGame right now, becouse there are more tutorials about it.
Sure, no problem! You can download the file from here: https://gist.github.com/agentphantom/f42968eb3b869dcb2b773b38465eafe4 You will only require to install one PIP package: pip install pysher --upgrade Instead of jsons you will receive a dictionary.
I enjoyed my Surface Pro 3 for 3 years or so. Now, the battery has become real crap and it often throttles itself due to heating with even only light workloads. It needs a new battery and possibly an internal cleaning, but they are apparently very difficult to take apart (the guy doing one in the demo video I found cracked the screen). Now I'm getting a Lenovo Thinkpad to replace it. So I'd say - go with the Surface if you want to use it to take notes. OneNote + the S-Pen was great for this. Real natural writing. However, if you don't need the notes, I'd get something a *little* thicker with better thermal management and a replaceable battery. 
Lol. I hope you finished taking care of business first! :)
Thanks!
Cheers!
Feel free to comment on the tutorials if you have a question - I monitor it pretty closely 
It's pretty nice, I just use it for fixing bugs and writing some code/documentation, so light tasks, PyCharm/Visual Studio/Visual Studio Code work all like a charm, battery life is not exceptional but still good enough, it’s light and nice looking. I think that if you don't want to waste money on a MacBook 12" Just because you really need macOS, the Surface Pro is your best option.
Thank you for the Indepth answer! How does it fare with databases , etc?
Thank you for this ! Do you reccomend the 256ssd?
For me 128GB in enough, it depends on your needs. I use a lot OneDrive, so storage is not a problem. It's really a good product, don't worry!
Awesome!!! Thanks a lot I appreciate your time 
Your a star pal I just couldn't get my head around the pusher element of it. Really need this one as well as it's the only one that offers USD to EUR directly instead of trying to go through a crypto. Still reading up on the packages you listed earlier, am I correct in stating it's possible to launch a local server using flask? Was thinking of serving a static web page with the current statistics but would prefer to keep it all native if possible. Gotta say though it's some bloody learning curve with the nuances of python over java / javascript, it's very easy to read and code but I keep going too fast and leaving small latent errors lol. 
Indeed, Pusher is a bit different but actually easier to implement. You basically need to specify the Pusher Key ID, subscribe to the channel and listen to the event type. I assumed you needed btc/eur but you can easily tweak those pairs. In the following link you can see a list of all available pairs: https://www.bitstamp.net/websocket/ Yes, with Flask you can easily serve an HTML page with the data from the exchanges, Flask is also Python and super easy to learn. Don't worry about learning too fast, with practice all the small errors go away.
There's a job board at the top of this subreddit
Oh man, I apologize! I was on mobile and didn't even know it was there! You think I should just remove this post then? 
Yeah think it's the first time I've complained about picking something up and being able to use it in a couple of days. Cheers for the info I've made another top level post but it hasn't shown up yet, if you don't mind I'd like your advice on it. I've coded all this up in the Bitmex sample market maker and was looking at python wrappers for the exchanges. I've tried to install one in the virtual environment but when I run a simple test script it says no such package. Is this normal or am I being stupid?
When you create virtual environments you need to reinstall all the required packages again. When you create a virtual environment is like you create a fresh Python installation as it comes by default.

Last commit was in March this year, are you one of the contributors? Might be itnerested 
The computation will not change a lot since now. It's a software for backtesting trading strategies and getting results as Excel files via openpyxl and interactive data plots via Bokeh. It loads in memory 500 pandas/dask dataframes (10GB data on disk stored in Apache Parquet file format), creates asset objects from data, apply the desired strategy function to all the assets in parallel, stacks the all the assets results (2-dimensional numpy arrays) to create a 3-dimensional portfolio array by slicing it and performing computaion vertically always with numpy. Then it creates results files and store them locally. A lot of computation can be parallelized, so more cores I can get the faster the software will be, but still there are portions of sequential code, and that's why I need high IPC and Intel with MKL/AVX2-512 could be a better option. It's not an easy choice.
Yeah I understand that part however whilst inside the environment I mkdir test, cd test and pip install *****, I then write a simple script that uses the new dependency and get "no such package" or something similar. Using ls shows nothing in the directory even when cloned from GitHub. I'm sure it's something simple and I'm doing something wrong but I can't find anything online that's similar. Cheers
Looks like pro-desktop-workstation + easy-mobile-devide is the most suggested solution and I think is the most future proof and wise way to invest my money. It still remains the problem on the hardware, Intel (MKL, AVX2-512) vs AMD (cheap cores).
I see, I don't have much experience with virtual envs, but just to be sure, are you activating it before using it?
Yeah it's not been deactivated since I started. Might just make a new one and install from scratch and see what happens. Someone just commented on my top level post saying that if files / folders are moved it can screw things up so it might be I need to set up the file system prior to creating it. Cheers
We can see the history being written! Thanks for the plugins.
I have moved some sub folders during the modification to make it more user friendly. Is this likely to affect it in your opinion?
What exactly did you modify? The virtualenv? If so, don't do that.
No the project file structure pal, files moved and folders created with new files inside. Just at a bit of a loss because the install says everything went ok.
No, I'm a dev for FreeCAD but just a power user for wger, who's also interested in packaging it for Debian (although it's currently blocked by a few Javascript packaging problems, story for another day.) In terms of "owning your data", health and fitness stuff is some of the most important and so I think the self-hosted space really needs something like wger. Because of this, and because I think it's good learning advice, I wanted to do a little evangelizing :)
New to Python (and coding in general). Decided to make a program to learn (on top of reading). Use: track a persons time spent working on different clients. To be very lightweight/quick. Record results to CSV. Using tkinter. Open CSV (or make if not one present). Buttons can only be used if in order (e.g. cant press stop before start). Next step is to make a button to build reports with the data using matplotlib and bring up pie charts etc. Very happy to have actually made something!
&gt; You are touching it. You just don't know that you are. Give me the knowledge bro! &gt; You may be able to gain more available power by changing your algorithms to be memory dependent via generators. I'm already using generators whenever I can. &gt; I can't say much for the specifics of threadripper, but the Ryzen line has been shown to be better than MKL when using OpenBLAS by around 22% on some calculations, and 10% worse on others (by some Julia users). I've read that too, but I'm only a Python developer, I don't know anything about any other programming language, so I have no idea how to compile OpenBLAS, ATLAS, LAPACK for AMD hardware. I just install Anaconda &amp; PyCharm and that's it. &amp;#x200B;
For a first program, this is extremely impressive. Well done OP.
You'll have to elaborate on that one. This could mean so many things. Can you show the structure of your project in a code block or something?
Not at my PC but I'll try to explain, sorry if this is hard to follow, Project folder(virtual env entry point) Market maker folder(installed with pip) All the stuff that came in market maker Web socket folder(new) All my custom scripts Test folder ****This is where I installed the package using pip**** Sorry again but I'm on mobile
If you change **append** to https://docs.julialang.org/en/latest/base/collections/#Base.union does it improve performance?
now the time is 0.45 for julia (with union) and 0.0005 for python, i made it even faster(not with union)
Very useful, very nice! Well done!
I don't really know Julia, but my super quick read is that the Julia version is using array inclusion checks which makes the overall perfomance quadratic, and the Python version is using `set` inclusion checks which has linear performance. So this really isn't a fair comparison at all. I'm assuming Julia has some sort of set data structure which would have comparable asymptotic performance, and which I suspect would be faster than the Python version.
&gt; Switch to ATLAS, LAPACK and OpenBLAS: [https://discourse.julialang.org/t/openblas-is-faster-than-intel-mkl-on-amd-hardware-ryzen/8033](https://discourse.julialang.org/t/openblas-is-faster-than-intel-mkl-on-amd-hardware-ryzen/8033) As I said to another user, I'm only a Python developer, I don't know anything about any other programming language, so I have no idea how to compile ATLAS/LAPACK/OpenBLAS for AMD hardware on Windows/Linux. I just install Anaconda &amp; PyCharm and that's it. Also, [looks like](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45722188/tutorial-for-installing-numpy-with-openblas-on-windows) that "compiling ATLAS/LAPACK/OpenBLAS from source" it's not an easy task, at least under Windows. So I think this is a major problem for me (I don't understand why Anaconda doesn't offer an option for OpenBLAS/ATLAS/LAPACK instead of MKL when downloading their platform).
Why should I care so much about L1 cache? I think already know the answer, I just would like to have a detailed explanation. Thank you.
Good job, man, good job!
I've been looking for a plugin like this for a while. Thank you very much for your contribution!
I'm fairly confident that the issue here is that 1) you're not using the same algorithm on both sides, 2) you're including time spent printing, and 3) you're not using good benchmarking tools. On the Python side, I run an `ipython` REPL and get results like In [3]: %timeit sum(i for i in range(1000) if i % 3 == 0 or i % 5 == 0) 88.9 µs ± 3.78 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10000 loops each) On the Julia side, I cooked up julia&gt; using BenchmarkTools julia&gt; @btime sum([x for x in 1:999 if (x % 3 == 0 || x % 5 == 0)]) 5.128 μs (10 allocations: 8.47 KiB) 233168 You'll need to install BenchmarkTools from [https://github.com/JuliaCI/BenchmarkTools.jl](https://github.com/JuliaCI/BenchmarkTools.jl). I'm no Julia expert, but I imagine that isn't the most efficient version either.
&gt; One way you could ballpark it yourself for your specific usage is calculate the performance gain that using Intel's optimisations give you, and see how that percentage difference compares to the difference in [CPU benchmarks](https://www.phoronix.com/). It's crude, yes, but would at least give you some insight. As other users alrady said, in order to remove Intel optimization (MKL) I should switch to ATLAS/LAPACK/OpenBLAS , but I'm only a Python developer, don't talk to me about compiling and so on, cause it's alien to me and that's a major problem. &gt; If you do make the switch, please do report back with some numbers. Oh dont' worry, I'll create a new post here with the comparison results. It's just a matter of some weeks. Looks like pro-desktop-workstation + easy-mobile-devide is the most suggested solution and I think is the most future proof and wise way to invest my money.
Is it an option to deploy your code elsewhere? The choice of workstation does not matter as much, as you could use a dedicated machine for the execution of your code.
This is really inspiring for newbies! Nicely done and designed for a first program! 
Evrything that's doable it's an option! I just don't know anything about dedicated remote machines and their costs.
These are some awesome ideas, well done!!
Please post this in the job sticky
This is a really awesome program. This is the best way of leaning how to code. Take bits and pieces mash it together... watch it work!! 
Very good one. It does not use pygame and shows a good capability of turtle module pretty well. This is an excellent beginner learning project.

great job op. keep it up
&gt; Give me the knowledge bro! Any interpretation of Python bytecode occurs within the GIL. Depending on what you are doing, you can release it and then reacquire it later, but generally doing this would be something *extremely specific*, or not touching any Python objects. Even if it's in the first category, if it isn't also in the second, you can very seriously screw up. Because of this, release mechanisms only really exist in C/C++ (and in Cython, which transpiles to C, but has a nice semantically simple way of running code while the GIL is released). Most of numpy is fast because, on top of other things, it releases the GIL as soon as possible (holding on to this global mutex is what makes Python so slow). Ex, IIRC arrays are just special wrappers around C arrays + some configuration for the wrapper, any time you use a numpy specific type (ex int32), then it is a special wrapper around a standard 32 bit integer. If you use something like `bool`, you're actually using `bool_`, which is the numpy-wrapper around some equivalent C type that is meant to be able to be 100% compatible with the Python type. Knowing this, if you say, add two to an array of what you think is ints, the internal C array version of those ints are accessed, and a C int 2 is added to each item as it is placed in a new place in memory, then a new wrapping view is made, the lock reacquired to finalize the view with whatever python-specifics it needs, then you go onward. Furthermore every python bytecode execution acquires the GIL, does it's thing, then releases. This is why threading is slow when CPU bound but not IO bound-- iobound ops don't really acquire the GIL as long nor as often, perhaps even only on the initial call and conversion of the buffer into C. Processes don't touch the main process's GIL because anything sent to execute in them is serialized, sent to the process, deserialized, then executed. They touch their own GIL-- and that makes sense because in all technicality they have their own interpreter. There's even a PEP to expose the sub-interpreter C API as python wrappers to be able to directly create and execute code in these sub interpreters-- the idea being is combining them with Threads, you theoretically no longer need something as resouces heavy as a Process, because each interpreter has it's own lock. Basically imagine if the `code` module and `multiprocessing` had a baby with a defect that doesn't have a pthread limb, so you can manually give it one via `threading.Thread`. I use this gorey analogy because I hate the current proposed implementation-- instead of serializing and executing internally (which can quite simply be done with the inspect module), the implementation expects a string that compiles into valid Python code. It's clunky and you lose safety of static analysis tools and IDEs. There's plenty of better solutions, the simplest is a new string prefix which adds methods to create subinterpreters around it, or use the inspect module as mentioned. &gt; I've read that too, but I'm only a Python developer, I don't know anything about any other programming language, so I have no idea how to compile OpenBLAS, ATLAS, LAPACK for AMD hardware. I just install Anaconda &amp; PyCharm and that's it. With respect, you don't need to know anything about other programming languages to follow some simple tutorials on how to build numpy with any given math internal library. Also I'm pretty sure the version on PIP is built against openblas. You can check via numpy.show_config

Sounds like a case for PyAudio : https://people.csail.mit.edu/hubert/pyaudio/
like a bootcamp?
oh ok. Good luck!
Nope. Not looked at github yet.
ok cool. Nice work!
Will do! Give me 5 minutes to get behind my computer. Thanks. 
Good job mate, that’s pretty impressive!
It’s a good idea. You would not believe how many software engineering jobs there are where the primary requirement is Java.

You could use the `max` function like: def second_largest(my_list): my_list.remove(max(my_list)) return max(my_list) &amp;#x200B;
sorted(my_list)[-2]
Wow that is impressive. My first program was Hello World lol
Oh sorry, I should have written the last paragraph differently, because I'm not confident at all in that. Edited the paragraph now. 
excellent, thanks! 
&gt; isolated script to make sure everything is installed and working, however it throws an error saying there is no such package - In your isolated script - did you activate the virtualenv before it runs ? - Check if you're using the python interpreter from the virtualenv and not the default one.

Good! What did you did for UI?
Definitely incorporate version control on your next project and push your commits to github! It’s a great way to build a portfolio while keeping your code history easily accessible for yourself!
anyone else follow the tutorial but couldn't get "from app_config import log" to import??

If I could give you a suggestion, try changing to button text instead of having 4 Buttons. Start stop could be the same Buttonn 
Reminds me of TimeBilling by Lemontech, good stuff OP, keep it going
use the json standard library for reading and writing the json files. you wont append entries to the current file but read, change in memory and rewrite the whole thing.
[https://pybee.org/](https://pybee.org/) could be an option
For displaying calendar data in month view. Users can create events that are recurring daily, monthly, weekly, etc.
Thanks, I will have a look
Kivy is currently my top option, but I do not know what I dont know so I’m trying to gather more info.
Did you take a look at r/https://kivy.org?
I should have mentioned that one of my constraints is having to work with both Macs and Linux - this is why I use `~/.venv` instead of `/home/username/.venv` (which wouldn't work on Macs, where it should be `/Users/username/.venv`. I was annoyed to find that tilde-expansion doesn't work with shebangs, hence the code here. You're right though, if it's a single system (or multiple systems with the same OS), changing the shebang is definitely easier.
Put up code on Github? &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
This would be better on /r/learnpython, but in the meantime... Mean: use the `sum` builtin instead of reducing (if you're not allowed to use `sum` for some reason, why would you be allowed to use `reduce`?). Median: again, it looks like you should just sort the list using `sorted`. Mode: use a `Counter` from the [collections module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html). You might object and say "but I wanted to build my own versions!". The above changes are still yours: you're just using better components. Programming is all about re-using small building blocks effectively.
Thanks for the inputs. Will post the query on /r/learnpython too. And I should have mentioned it in the post - the assignment asked me to try to do this using reduce(); hence the usage. 
Thank you so much! :) I have one more query in case you have time - is there a better way to write the mode bit using reduce()? I couldn't think of a way to use reduce() there. 
Wow this is pretty cool love this ❤️❤️
We have in our website a pretty rare use case where we need to handle session expiry times differently for specific user groups, user permissions, request metadata, etc.. This package was created to help defining those expiry rules, for anonymous and authenticated users, with simple configurations. It also helps defining default expiry times for anonymous and authenticated users. Maybe it also fits you, so I decided to make it open-source and share it.
This is a re-post because the previously had a broken link :-( &amp;#x200B; A few months ago I implemented this simple flask app that processes a dataset file (called supermarket.arff) from Weka and gives recommendations based on an existing market basket. ​ Despite its simplicity, I feel like it is worth sharing, cause sometimes we don't really understand how websites and other applications recommend things. They probably use different approaches or technologies other than this one, but this is an easy to implement item recommendation application, using association rules and apriori.
Everything. Every middle-tier/Logic that you could imagine. It’s just a language of choice by most full-stack teams. 
Thank you, I'll give it a try!

Cool, but will be nice if this will support env from docker. If i have project interpreter in docker then pylint is not able to see any imports in project.
Lots of GUI's are cross platform. [Here's a short list](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/faq#wiki_what_gui_should_i_use.3F). What else do you want from a GUI? In a nutshell, tkinter is fast to program but looks kinda outdated and blocky. PyQt looks much more modern and you can use the graphical design QtDesigner, but it's more work to learn and use. 
Depends on the complexity. Also remember that PyQt5 is GPL v3 that may add some constraints.
Thanks, I'll probably use Qt or this new Beeware thing I just discovered. I want to make a Trello clone that detects a Keybase installation and crates Kanban boards for your Keybase teams.
That's cool especially for someone that's just starting out !!! i'd suggest you also learn about pygame to learn about OOP and drawing images and things like that, it'll help you(you can take references on things to create from this channel: [https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman](https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman)). and maybe also at a more advanced level, try TensorFlow and learning about AI. That'll greatly increase your understanding of programming. Good Luck!

I don't really know the math or the algorithm behind it, but it looks like your looking for a [Voronoi Diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram).
**Voronoi diagram** In mathematics, a Voronoi diagram is a partitioning of a plane into regions based on distance to points in a specific subset of the plane. That set of points (called seeds, sites, or generators) is specified beforehand, and for each seed there is a corresponding region consisting of all points closer to that seed than to any other. These regions are called Voronoi cells. The Voronoi diagram of a set of points is dual to its Delaunay triangulation. *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Python/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28

how does it compare to flask?
It seems that there are a plethora of resources available from a simple google search for tkinter tutorials/examples. After seeing OP's post, I googled for one myself out of curiosity and found myself working through this [one](https://likegeeks.com/python-gui-examples-tkinter-tutorial/) in no time. Nothing fancy and I'm sure there are better tutorials, but it gave me a decent idea of the type of widgets available with the module, how to create them, give them functionality, etc.
It seems that your comment contains 1 or more links that are hard to tap for mobile users. I will extend those so they're easier for our sausage fingers to click!

This is great. Exactly what I was looking for an easy UI to select config options before running my script. Thanks!
I'm extremely impressed by the design. Did you make it yourself or did you draw inspiration from other sites? I've been doing this for eight years but with tkinter all my programs remain gray and pale.
'convert to frequencies' is a vague term. are you trying to analyze the audio stream's frequency content? for that, you would have to use fast fourier transform. here's something to get you started: https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/tutorial/fftpack.html#fast-fourier-transforms
Denmark?
nah, better, Sweden
I'm yet to do that. 😒
You'll want customizability but still very good "defaults" :) The idea with removing that line is not so much the line, but it is that you can create a console script eventually that might add some functionality other than `render`.
Looks great! I'd add a confirmation to the reset button just in case.
How to check things like this: 1. Activate virtual environment if not yet active (you need to see a modified shell prompt with something that resembles the name you've given to your environment). 2. Run `pip show &lt;package-name&gt;` where `&lt;package-name&gt;` is the package you want to use. If the output is empty, it means the package is not installed. It is possible that you did not install it, even if you ran `pip install &lt;package-name&gt;` because it conflicts with another packages already there / is not available for your platform / is not available for the Python version used by your virtual environment. 3. Run `pip install &lt;package-name&gt;`. Pay close attention to the messages you see. `pip` will actually report failure, it it isn't able to install a package. 4. If `pip show` gives you an affirmative answer, but you still cannot import the package, open the directory that `pip` claims to be the directory where the package was installed and inspect the source code of the package: perhaps the name is different? (Pay close attention to capitalization, underscores etc. sometimes you may be following documentation that is not up-to-date or too new compared to the package).

Your desktop system is already quite good. What you can improve is CPU clock and RAM speed, maybe number of cores. Don't think any mobile workstations can do much in those areas. &amp;#x200B; A desktop with intel 8700K or Ryzen 2700x coupled with 3600-4000MHz DDR4 will give you a noticeable performance improvement. Threadripper if Dask multi-core is a big part of calculations. &amp;#x200B; As for Intel and MKL: MKL will run perfectly fine (and fast) on modern AMD processors. It's all about instruction sets, and Ryzen supports everything Intel does. Except AVX-512, which a) is only applicable to small portion of calculation and b) MKL will fallback to other instruction sets (AVX, AVX2) without a huge loss. Don't worry about it.
Note that there is 2 alternatives for Qt: PyQt5 or PySide2
&gt; What you can improve is CPU clock and RAM speed, maybe number of cores. I'm using a NUC, so I can't improve CPU/RAM speed, or the number of cores. &gt; As for Intel and MKL: MKL will run perfectly fine (and fast) on modern AMD processors. [Looks like OpenBLAS is faster than Intel MKL on AMD hardware](https://discourse.julialang.org/t/openblas-is-faster-than-intel-mkl-on-amd-hardware-ryzen/8033), but compiling OpenBLAS is not an easy task for me, as I am only a Python developer.
Well done. For someone just starting this is impressive. Don't stop learning. A good tip I wish I was given when I first started is to read other people's code. If you have the time, try doing that.
His solution is much more time efficient. You have two for loops with loops inside of them (if....in), where as by storing letters in a dictionary he reduces the time requirement to be (I think) linear
23, are you having a laugh?? most people are leaving university circa this age never mind being "too late"
I'll give this a shot tonight might be the package isn't compatible with python3. If this is the case is it possible to use the python 2.x interpreter inside the python3 environment?
I'm new to prorgamming and Pythin and I can't wait to be able to produce somethig like this. Nice one. 
To be honest, at the moment, I’m not really. I’m not to familiar with focus stacking either, so I’m just trying to gather as much info as I can. I’ve inherited some c++ code but am yet to go through it in detail to make sense of it
Consider adding the functionality to auto checkout once the system is idle for more than 15 minutes.
axis = 1
Correct!
Thanks for the reply! But unfortunately, that doesn't work. Adding axis = 1 only changes my columns order to Marriage Rates first and then Fertility rates :/
In terms of IDE, you can't go wrong with PyCharm Community. I use it and the code assistance and intellisense is very good. Having said that, you could also go with Visual Studio Code or even Vim if you wish to work on the command line.
https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/merging.html Second hit on google. This is a very good reference with visual representations. I understand the frustration, as I also had some problems with concatentation when I started learning pandas. If I had to give you an answer to what you are doing wrong, it would not be the missing axis=1, but rather that you struggle for a whole day with something, which can be solved fairly quickly with google. It should be your ally and when you start asking it the right questions, this type of problems should be solved faster.
it doesn't work? perhaps I misunderstood your problem do you have a link to the files?
Thanks u/Xavenne, I made it myself based on an itch I have with my job being an Account Director in a service industry. I used a .grid() based system and just played around with colours, OptionMenu()'s, borders, activebackground, etc. 
Good idea u/criangulien, I will play with this tonight!
I don't currently use Github. 
I will look into it thanks
Yes good idea, will try and add this tonight. 
I am half way through reading [Learning Python by Mark Lutz](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/80435.Learning_Python). It seems really good but is a very long read and I found myself losing grip on concepts as I read on so I decided to just try and make something. On top of this, I have watched youtube videos, googled etc. 
tkinter, which was surprisingly easier to learn than I expected. Probably on par with HTML. I made the GUI first and although I had never touched tkinter before, I made learnt it and made that GUI in a day (then another day of minor tweaks) on the weekend. 
I teach python with pycharm community edition. One of my topics is flake8 and I'd definitely use such plugin. 
Ok, there seems to be interest, but I am not really familiar with this checker (and with Python on general: I am an Android developer that just started to play with Python): can you help me to understand all the possible use cases and the output of the validation? Checking the docs I saw that it doesn't provide a json/xml output out-of-the-box but you need to use an extension for that. I would like to stick to the feature provided by the stock version so I guess I have to parse the human friendly output. For Mypy and PyLint I have different level of severity (error, warning, info/note, etc). Do I have the same thing also in flake8? I found some violation code [here](https://pycodestyle.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html#error-codes) and others [here](http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/user/error-codes.html): is there a page that list them all? Can I use these as my source for **all** the possible severity errors I can have (very important information since I have to parse them)? Can a plugin define its own errors that don't start with 'F', 'E' or 'W'? Do you have a suggestion on how to handle the filter? Does it make sens to have a filter at all? How should I group the errors? (if someone else want to also provide support/knowledge about this tool, please comment here or send me a PM)
What languages or frameworks have you considered/used?
I'm glad that you're learning by getting things done and solving problems. BUT this would be better solved with a mobile ready web application.
Thanks. I wanted it to be a desktop app so I didn't need to launch via the web and so it took minimal screen space and can be on top of all other windows. Although I am sure this could be done via a small popup. Plus, centralising each users csv data more easily would be good. Plus, I haven't even looked at web apps yet so it's currently outside my skill set but I could use that as an opportunity to learn!
Thanks u/thomasginn, I imagine if your coming from c# the GUI build may seem more impressive a feat than it actually is. tkinter is a built-in for python and I understand that it is significantly easier to use than many other languages (much less lines of code needed etc). 
Depends on what you are using it for and on how you do it. Both approaches have pros and cons. I believe oop has a bad rep because of languages like C++ and especially Java (imo). To quote Alan Kay: &gt; "I made up the term object-oriented, and I can tell you I did not have C++ in mind."
And you can do neither in Python :x
What's missing from python to be able to do OOP? Not that you'd want to do pure OOP in python anyway.
If your classes are repetitive you're not doing OOP right. Write it once and subclass it.
Is it open source? Can you provide a link to the repo?
u/criangulien I have now done this by putting the stop &amp; start button in the same grid location, then using .lift() and .lower to change at the event. 
this smells like homework and Cunningham's law
1. Create an example-config.ini (so people can copy and add their api key in it) 2. .gitignore and add config.ini (that way the config.ini will never be pushed to git) 3. don't be stresses each time when pushing, because your secrets now are save in the config.ini)
Good luck writing functional in a large corporate team.
[Sure](https://github.com/timfeathers/planterbox)
Cheers for the help pal, turns out the alias for pip had been forgotten. Managed to check earlier today and it had used 2.7 instead of 3.6. installed using pip3 and all is working. Cheers

The irony is that using plain python is probably going to be fast as well. That really is developer time well spent, and no need to write a blog post ;) with open(filename) as f: dc = [] for line in f: key,_, value = line.partition("#") values = value.split() dc[key] = values
Very readable and simple but potentially malicious 😈
Good luck! Naturally you might have to tweak it a little, but it should be a good basis for the "reading" part :)
when I first learnt it it was as hard as talking to a brick wall secondly it just adds more work watch this video: &amp;#x200B; [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9pEzgHorH0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9pEzgHorH0)
Thanks for the reference and the link. That *is* what I wanted. A quick Google search shows me that scipy has a function for it.
as soon as this person claimed the idiomatic way was `apply` I knew he/she was probably using pandas wrong and this article wasn't worth the read. if I'm wrong, please let me know
In C++ you can use a std::deque (there are other options too), so you only have to read from the file once. You might have to copy to a python data type, but copying from ram to ram is going to be a whole lot faster than reading from the hdd twice.
Python's is definitely good enough to be useful, built-in enough that you don't really need to learn anything on top of an understanding of other languages' classes (`__new__` is the only thing I can think of), and useful enough that the only reason you wouldn't use it for what is normally an OOP task is if there's already a language construct which does it better - which fully OOP languages are just straight-up lacking. Python classes are definitely better than javascript's, for example.
You may very well be right! What would you say is the idiomatic way?
I wrote a custom log handler and formatted that logs everything as key value pairs. My handler takes the `extra` parameter that all log methods support and uses that as the structured data so that something like `logging.info("Hello", extra={"foo": "bar"})` is output at `at=INFO message="Hello" foo="bar"`. Key value pairs are easy to parse and are supported by most logging services. Why not format the data into the message? Because that makes it much more difficult to parse messages and to parse data from the logs. Structured data can be aggregated and analyzed.
