For high data loads, sure. But it's not a general purpose DB, so you'll probably end up maintaining two different database instances for minor benefits. I'm all for choosing the right tool from the beginning, but in this case I think Postgres is good enough for a long time.
I use pyodbc, openpyxl all the time for automation at work. Lots of automatic reports. Freezing them a distributing the tools also makes it easier when you want to give others your program.
I just like writing about Python and decided to write some books on the topic. You might find my blog helpful as well: https://www.blog.pythonlibrary.org/ I can help a little with code questions, but I really recommend posting on r/learnpython, comp.lang.py or StackOverflow as well as I tend to get pretty busy and it might take a while to get back to you.
Pandas + xlwings ftw

Created the post this morning on /r/rabbitmq with no real bite or discussion. So trying to gather some dialog here. What would your alternativeto be for celery using rabbitmq? If you have questions about the libraries mentioned feel free to ask.
I'm intrigued by the order you've put integration (or at least, comparative) tests and convergence tests, when I've done them before, I've typically considered the convergence tests a lower test than comparative tests - ie. You want to make sure your code has properly converged (or at least, is converging) before you compare it to something. If you know what your convergence properties should be, is there benefit to creating an automated test than runs multiple resolutions and tries to fit the convergence? I can see how this would be a good idea, but the implementation could be difficult - Too restrictive, and it could be too sensitive to changes. Too lax and it won't be useful. There is also the issue of how to stop the round-off error at the end of your convergence confusing everything. The Method of Manufactured Solutions is definitely a good suggestion, although it confused me at first because I know it as False Forcing!
No, it's not a 100% signal, but it is a signal. How about it's the second most loved DB according to the StackOverflow survey (that is voted by active users of MongoDB) and the most wanted for those not yet using it. Also a stupid ranking made by idiots?
Nope. But it's very highly ranked on the Most Loved category of people who do use it according to StackOverflow.
Hope so! Thanks for checking out the course.
http://fredfries.pythonanywhere.com/ This is it so far, I am now going to add multi threading to make it faster 
I've had a quick play with Hypothesis and it is definitely a useful tool! Thank you for the suggestion :) Do you mind if I ask a few questions about how it works? It seems to cluster examples around the edges of a range and the middle is relatively under sampled. For example, when I have a range like 0 &lt;= x &lt;= 10^4, examples of O(1) are basically non-existent. I know that my values will typically be in this middle range, with only a few rare extreme values. Does it matter that the examples don't really consider the expected usage? I'll try to look at the other two soon!
No, that's just a lot of people that don't know any better. That's why it's important to have periodic reminders to not use MongoDB in production 😊
Hey guys, I edited Google so it only returns cat pictures. You're welcome.

Yes, `map(inc, range(0,10))` will work. `def` and `lambda` to exactly the same thing, it's only the syntax that's different. --- If you have more questions like this it's better to post them on /r/learnpython. Be sure to [format your code for reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/faq#wiki_how_do_i_format_code.3F) or use a site like pastebin. Also, include which version of python and what OS you are using. 
Great to see Python is a top programming language. Hopefully, the job market will grow due this news. 
Python is awesome, you're right! I'm sure you would want to go into a specific field sometine though. Depending on what you're interested in take a look at data science, web development, rasberry pi etc. I'm sure you will find something you like. Youtube is your friend in learning new stuff.
&gt; I've typically considered the convergence tests a lower test than comparative tests - ie. You want to make sure your code has properly converged (or at least, is converging) before you compare it to something I meant that setting up a convergence test, as you recognize, necessarily entails running at multiple resolutions in order to talk about whether something is converging. This is what I meant by higher complexity, especially because you have the added requirement of fitting the measured convergence rate. My preference is to start simple by just doing a single simulation and comparing it to a problem with a known analytical solution, and heuristically checking that you are close to the answer. &gt;If you know what your convergence properties should be, is there benefit to creating an automated test than runs multiple resolutions and tries to fit the convergence? Yes, one benefit is to make sure you don't have a bug in your code that prevents you from getting the desired convergence! Or, you might think of it as empirical confirmation of convergence for the theoretical method. I agree that some difficulties might discourage one from making convergence an automated test, rather than something manual with human interpretation. Some reasons you point out; another reason could be if it's too slow. But if you are able to make the automated test run in reasonable speed, I recommend it. "Sensitive to changes" is a feature, not a bug! It's often easy to make seemingly innocuous changes in one part of the code, which you tell yourself won't have a major effect, but in fact do. The automated test alerts you to these kinds of things.
I'm having problems setting up a new project. I cannot find a suitable "interpreter". Tried to find help googling but couldn't find an answer. Can you help? What's an interpreter?

Surprised to see Java that high up, would've figured more trendy languages would show up higher. Goes to show what people actually use.
My MSc project ended up as a TeX repo for the same reason.
Awesome, thanks man!
Looks pretty good. You should post this on /r/learnpython as well. --- I think those parts are far too short to be justified as parts. All 6 of those should be a single page. --- Just like you did with decorators, I think you should explain that the factory notation is equivalent to target = factory(args)(target) --- You pointed out that any callable can be a decorator, but you didn't point out that any callable can be decorated. I suggest you add an example of decorating a class. --- There's a lot of decorators in standard python. I suggest a part VII where to mention a few of them and how to use them. `@property`, `@classmethod`, `@total_ordering` and `@lru_cache` come to mind as very useful. 
I made a front-end program to help keep track of my workout routine (trying to get in shape before Christmas). It's working fine, now I'm just adding cool things to it (working on things like a calorie calculator at the moment). 
 @boom # &lt;= this is you calling the function The python decorator syntax is just shorthand for this call: stealth = boom(stealth) So no, it will not "run without calling it".
also sklearn and tensorflow
@cephalopod1 I was able to make pipeable work in conjunction with docopt. But it required a slight modification to the _get_input method in pipeable. I needed to make the modification because if no arguments are supplied then docopt by default will print a nice "usage" string based on the docopt specifications in the script. In order to use pipeable with docopt, I needed to decorate my main function with @Pipe. But if no arguments were supplied pipeable throws an IndexError like so: Traceback (most recent call last): File "stub.py", line 25, in &lt;module&gt; @Pipe() File "/Users/rrajen/Projects/Python/Pipeable/pipeable/pipeable.py", line 24, in __call__ wrapper_func() File "/Users/rrajen/Projects/Python/Pipeable/pipeable/pipeable.py", line 17, in wrapper_func inp = self._get_input() File "/Users/rrajen/Projects/Python/Pipeable/pipeable/pipeable.py", line 55, in _get_input raise IndexError(message) IndexError: No input provided. In order to work around this, I modified _get_input as follows: def _get_input(self): """ Gets the input from stdin if it exists. Otherwise, it looks for a command line argument. Raises an error if no argument is given. """ if not sys.stdin.isatty(): inp = sys.stdin.read() elif len(sys.argv) &gt;= 2: print len(sys.argv) try: inp = sys.argv[1] except IndexError: message = 'No input provided.' raise IndexError(message) else: inp = None return inp Other than that, I had to change setup.py to set python_requires='&gt;=2.7' (some of us are still living in ancient times I suppose ;-) ) All in all, it works reasonably well for my purposes. Not sure if you want to incorporate the changes I had to make for my purposes in a manner that makes pipeable live by itself as well as coexist with docopt. Thanks again for the module :-)
Thanks! I will definitely make use of these ideas :)
Or what people are forced to use. But Java fanboys get all cringy and defensive when you point out that there are other languages than Java.
Congratulations, you actually did it! xD
Personally I'd like to see in depth comparisons to sure and ensure, which are more mature and appear to do more or less the same thing. Coz glancing at the readme, my first impression was "oh, I already have all of this".
[This was just posted 2 mintues ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/75yvog/looking_for_a_python_mentor_or_suggestions_on_how/). 
I will make those changes! Thank you for trying this out. I'll release a new version tonight and let you know once it's available!
Haha! I didn't think that'd actually work!
Competition in that space is tough. Remember you're competing against Stack Overflow, so any explanations need to be on point for Google to index them higher. Agreeing with @novel that you could combine all those parts into one. You might want to mention in the beginning there are three types of decorators: function, class, and class instance.
You got me!!!
That's pretty much the same argument.
&gt;the defense for MongoDB is convenience of use The only real convenience Mongo adds over, say, postgres, is its abandonment of schemas by default and its passwordless setup by default. Needless to say, those things have bitten thousands of developers who aren't even developing anything very big who have been hacked or have fallen into a mess of unnormalized data or gotten hacked by bots.
Unless this counts private repos I'm fairly certain most of them are people using it voluntarily, I have a hard time believing it'd be the third most popular language on Github simply because people are forced to use it _and_ upload their code to it.
Seriously. I spent some time recently actually developing a useful tool in node.js, the amount of 3rd party imports for basic functionality is astonishing. Really made me appreciation the Python standard library. The tools we have in the stdlib are nothing short of excellent.
Those "issues" can really just be chalked up to misuse.
Seems like there's competition [PyExpect](https://github.com/CapoChino/PyExpect) apart from the comment:- &gt; Note: I'm currently awaiting approval from my previous employer to release this source. That was four years ago, nothing since.
The whole Java Script environment is a mess. The language is descent but using libraries for products must be a nightmare. I experienced something like this with C# which I had to learn for a project. While the basics are nice a simple function like a unix like logger has to be imported as well as a nice json serializer, because the one from MS isn't able to serialize a simple dictionary. 
Looks really cool. Congratulations!
^ title Some people in my class wanted some help with learning Python, so I started putting this together for them. What do you think? Please point out any typos or grammar errors. Thanks.
Do you have any experience in Python's asyncio? Or have you heard about it? I ask because I'm creating async scraping library from scratch and maybe in a few days i'll publish it on Github and I will need some help with developing new features. But it's really nothing certain.
You've lost me, where does it say anything about reversing the alphabetic characters?
Sorry
Thank you. I will certainly check out intertools and will add to my list :)
OK, here you go, but I strongly encourage you to learn to do it on your own :) import re def sort_alphanumeric_strings(in_seq): """ Return a list of items after sorting the numeric part of each item.""" sorted_alphanums = [] for elem in in_seq: alpha_num = re.findall(r"[^\W\d_]+|\d+", elem) alpha = alpha_num[0] num = ''.join(sorted(alpha_num[1])) sorted_alphanums.append(alpha + num) return sorted_alphanums seq = ['ID27363804', 'ID27364774', 'ID27366302', 'IDS27367315', 'IDS27367381', 'IDS27364139'] print(sort_alphanumeric_strings(seq)) It prints the following: ['ID02334678', 'ID23446777', 'ID02233667', 'IDS12335677', 'IDS12336778', 'IDS12334679']
I started with WingIDE, it helped me learn to program too because of its integrated help page. The student version is free.
Hi Where this tutorial located at?
Well I'll pipe in that doing those kinds of contributions is really appreciated. Thank you and good for you.
It's only late when you're dead. Keep fighting the good fight.
Cheapest? On your own computer for free.
Does it help to know that project has been worked on for *7 years* this month? That means that each day the developer "only" had to do 1/2555th of it. 
For the most part, YoutubeDL is that complex because 1) downloading videos from youtube is *not* a simple task at the best of times, and 2) lots and lots of options.
i love pandas!
Maybe the project was finished earlier but they kept on adding and editing the code? So you're telling me that this project's scope is huge and only an expert or a team of developers can realize this? 
If you don't want to use regular expressions, you could do it like so: def sort_alphanumeric_strings(in_seq): """ Return a list of items after sorting the numeric part of each item.""" sorted_alphanums = [] for item in in_seq: alpha = '' digits = '' for ch in item: if ch.isalpha(): alpha += ch if ch.isdigit(): digits += ch sorted_alphanums.append(alpha + ''.join(sorted(digits))) return sorted_alphanums
I guess I should have specified besides your regular computer
I was hoping it would also have soft asserts.
I have no idea what the actual history of work was on this project, but my guess is that 7 years ago it wasn't as sophisticated as it is now. It may have started rather basic and expanded greatly over time. Certainly the developer has been doing *something* for 7 full years, right? One dedicated person could do all this, but not someone at a rank beginner's level of course. It kind of seems like you are acting like you just started jogging and are frustrated because you can't run a 7 minute mile yet.

How is this lib different from using pytest and just doing: def expected(x): return x assert expected(1) == result ?
Yeah I should just focus on what I can do right now and the rest is up to time. Felt a bit frustrated and worried because I thought I'd never be able to do this. 
are they even made for the same purpose?, I mean they are both used in machine learning but I think tensorflow is made for low level while pytorch not, I may be wrong though, I have only used tensorflow

I use heroku to host web apps for testing. However, not sure if this is what you're asking. What do you mean by jobs? Like a job listing site ?
What's the first? English?
Why are you sorting individual characters in the strings, not the strings themselves?
I didn't like Python at first but damn it really grew on me.
You can get that good eventually, with time and practice. Be patient with yourself.
What do you mean by low level?
Kotlin made me love Java ecosystem again. Kotlin is amazingly well designed. Static typing makes it even better. 
sqlalchemy - yes. ORM - no. That's my preference at least.
This sounds cool! And useful! But I don't feel like I have a good grasp of how you use the API or what exactly it is doing...sorry I'm not sure how to phrase it in a more helpful way.
The loop doesn’t sort individual characters. It separates each element in the sequence based on alphabetic and numeric portions in it. On each iteration, the following expression re.findall(r"[^\W\d_]+|\d+", elem) returns: ['ID', '27363804'] ['ID', '27364774'] ['ID', '27366302'] ['IDS', '27367315'] ['IDS', '27367381'] ['IDS', '27364139'] ‘ID’ is the value at alpha_num[0] The numbers are still unsorted. ''.join(sorted(alpha_num[1])) gives you the concatenation of the sorted numeric portion. Then, it appends the alpha + num to sorted_alphanums 
We’re currently learning Python as our first language in CS. If anyone needs some good beginner tasks to actually use python I can provide the “homework” our professor is doing with us. I’d love to share it with a beginner and talk with someone about the homework’s so we can progress together :) 
Time. It takes time and dedication; like anything else one wishes to attain any higher level of understanding. youtube-dl has been in active development for at least 7 years (as another user here has noted), with at least 558 contributors (according to the Github repo). youtube-dl is no small side project some man or woman just pulled from their knuckles in a weekend -- indeed it is a large and sophisticated code base, covering many use-cases as well as taking care to address many edge cases (!!) Programming is hard; it'd be unfair for anyone to tell you different. It is not impossible, however. So, with time and dedication, yes, you will reach that level one day if it's your desire.
Sounds good man 
I would introduce this topic with simple generators rather than throwing dunder methods like `__iter__` and `__next__` into the ring. Also the choice of py2 instead of py3 is especially a bad choice on the iterator/generator topic. Python 3 utilizes the iterator protocol way more in plain sight `range, zip, enumerate` and also `asyncio` was a important addition to the whole idea `yield from, coroutines`... Also, the concept of tuples is very important here! My standard introducion looks like this: In [1]: sample = 1,2,3,4 In [2]: it = iter(sample) In [3]: it Out[3]: &lt;tuple_iterator at 0x7ff12a1ff470&gt; In [4]: next(it) Out[4]: 1 In [5]: next(it) Out[5]: 2 In [6]: next(it) Out[6]: 3 In [7]: next(it) Out[7]: 4 In [8]: next(it) --------------------------------------------------------------------------- StopIteration Traceback (most recent call last) &lt;ipython-input-8-2cdb14c0d4d6&gt; in &lt;module&gt;() ----&gt; 1 next(it) StopIteration: In [9]: it = iter(sample) In [10]: while True: # pseudo for-each loop implemention with a while loop ...: try: ...: item = next(it) ...: print(item) ...: except StopIteration: ...: break ...: 1 2 3 4 In [11]: def g(): ...: yield 1 ...: yield 2 ...: In [12]: it = g() In [13]: next(it) Out[13]: 1 In [14]: next(it) Out[14]: 2 In [15]: next(it) --------------------------------------------------------------------------- StopIteration Traceback (most recent call last) &lt;ipython-input-15-2cdb14c0d4d6&gt; in &lt;module&gt;() ----&gt; 1 next(it) StopIteration: In [16]: for item in g(): ...: print(item) ...: 1 2 Then you can start to go deeper into stuff like piping/delegation, sending and custom `__iter__` and `__next__`: In [17]: def printer(): ...: while True: ...: try: ...: msg = yield ...: print('Got: ', msg) ...: except StopIteration: ...: break ...: In [18]: p = printer() In [19]: p.send(None) # to init the generator In [20]: p.send('Monty') Got: Monty In [21]: p.send('Python') Got: Python In [22]: p.throw(StopIteration) --------------------------------------------------------------------------- StopIteration Traceback (most recent call last) &lt;ipython-input-22-354a8c7180d0&gt; in &lt;module&gt;() ----&gt; 1 p.throw(StopIteration) StopIteration: In [23]: p.send('Anybody there?') --------------------------------------------------------------------------- StopIteration Traceback (most recent call last) &lt;ipython-input-23-708d6664ba60&gt; in &lt;module&gt;() ----&gt; 1 p.send('Anybody there?')

I discovered youtube-dl and benefited from it just recently. There was an old favourite youtube video that had been deleted by the uploader. I tracked down a copy on youku (Chinese youtube basically) and wanted to download it for personal use. I went through many websites that seemed entirely built on downloading youku videos but they were outdated or something and couldn't handle it. The closest one gave me a recording but it had a few seconds of freeze near the beginning. I found youtube-dl via command line apt search and curiously saw it supports youku as well. It installed with a bunch libs I had not needed before due to using VLC. With a simple command it downloaded and processed the video for me. Finally it printed a warning about not being able to fix an error in the file and suggested installing an optional package. The video had a very small glitch at the very start. I installed the package (ffmpeg) and found that by running the same command again, it detected the video had already been downloaded and processed, and simply used the optional package to correct the glitch in it. Really nice.
Thanks! It's really great to get nice feedback on a project you've been pouring yourself into. We really appreciate it. We have complete documentation at https://docs.wallaroolabs.com/ that might help ease you in. Some folks, a single example is enough to get it. Others need more than 1 example. We all learn differently. If you give the documentation a go and still run into problems, feel free to email me sean@wallaroolabs.com. I'd love to find out what you are having a hard time with so that we can 1) get you going, 2) learn how we can improve our documentation. 
I'll gladly peruse the docs! Thanks.

&gt; I think I'm gonna download this project and learn it piece by piece until I understand every part. I will first read and look up everything I see in the code and try to apply what I learned on other mini projects like my database one. Then once I've fully absorbed everything youtube-dl has to offer me I'll try to make my own without the help of the code. Would this be a good road map for myself? There have been well over 15,000 commits (changes) to the project between over 500 contributors over seven years -- and [the first commit indicates *this* project started as a refactoring job of an older version](https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl/commit/4fa74b5252a23c2890ddee52b8ee5811b5bb2987). Something like this requires a lot of domain knowledge; going through and learning every piece of this will likely give you a really deep understanding of YouTube codecs, and not necessarily teach you anything about good coding practice or style. As (Cory Benfield so eloquently says,)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptbCIvve6-k] big open-source projects tend to get messy because of their wide scope. You're unlikely to need to build something of this size and scope from the ground up on your own. Don't let this freak you out. There are many, many steps between building a project with a single file and something of this size and scope.

&gt;How about it's the second most loved DB according to the StackOverflow survey (that is voted by active users of MongoDB) and the most wanted for those not yet using it. Also a stupid ranking made by idiots? Not exactly, but it does kind of weight more towards beginners wanting to get a website up and running in 30 minutes rather than people running a hardened production system. Mongo's marketing is, incidentally, directed with laser like focus on the beginner programmer. If you did a survey among experienced developers maintaining production systems the results would be quite different.

Let's say you want to create a neutral network, in theano or tensor flow you will have to design it, add the layers you want, create the activation functions and maybe train it with backpropagation using symbolic expresions to calculate gradient, if you use sklearn you just need to instatiate a class to do all that, but you have not that much control about the structure or how it is going to be trained
Thank you for a good answer sorry my code wasent formatted correctly as I am new to Reddit as well as python. This is my first program would you please explain what netloc is?
Python is really good.
Python comes with a debugger built in, it's called `pdb`. If you want something more visual, try PyCharm - it's a great IDE that comes with an equally great integrated debugger.
That'd be awesome!

That's actually... comforting to hear. Still waiting on them to finish up "adjudication" on my contract position so I can go back to work. It's been almost 3 months since they got my paperwork and I only left active duty a little over year ago and am still within the window of my re-investigation. It's always a love-hate relationship working for uncle sam.
I think you have the wrong idea in mind of what PyTorch does then, because it has the same goal in mind as Tensorflow, only in a different way. PyTorch networks are built during the training loop itself, Tensorflow creates a graph first to which data is fed.
Yeah that was basically what I was wondering if pytorch was somewhere in the middle between tensorflow and sklearn or it was mostly the same as tensorflow
Microsoft... One of the few things that ranks below JavaScript, lol. Really though, NPM isn't terrible. `package.json` for the project defines which packages to automatically grab when the project is moved to a new system, and works pretty smoothly. It's not terribly different than Python's PIP, really. It's not so much the fact that packages need to be imported for a product, it's the sheer size of the final dependency tree (which often ends up being massive, as one package depends on another that depends on another and so forth) -- and the need to import 3rd-party code for something as fundamental as [`strftime`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/strftime). In Python, even with fairly complex projects, there's usually a limited number of relatively self-contained 3rd party dependencies.
Most good IDEs have debuggers - I use Pycharm which has a really good debugger. I think IDLE has one - not sure how well featured it is.
The Army is really moving ahead of the curve on keeping software up to date. 
I'd suggest `pudb` if you're going to be trying out a debugger
Sorry for my own delayed reply as I rarely log into reddit. Sorry for the harsh delivery, but I hope you catch my drift. Good luck with the studies, see you out there!
I'll add to the sentiment, I'd love to see the homework
Glad I'm not the only one that likes SQLAlchemy core but not the ORM!
Well deserved, /u/takluyver!
Well, to be fair the sqlalchemy orm is a good orm. It's just that orms are the devil when you come from a data and database background.
I just wanted to pop into this comment to share my two cents on the matter. I think that there is a time and a place for everything, but as a developer I hate attention spent on code length. Of course we should all be efficient with our code, however I don't think that distributing functions across multiple scripts makes an application inherently easier to read. Whether you are tracking code through several functions and/or scripts or following along a long function, you are still reading X lines of code. Organization is important, and everyone has their own organization methods -- don't confuse "short snippets of code" with "organized". The best approach is to find best practices that work for the involved developers and stick to them.
Tensorflow and pytorch are very different but on a completely different axis than you are thinking about. Tensorflow is similar to the map-reduce way of computation where you define a dataflow graph on which the computation will be executed. So, construction and computation are clearly separated in tf which makes prototyping and debugging much harder. Pytorch is similar to using regular, numpy operations so it is much faster to play around with but it is also a lot harder to optimize and scale since the graph is not determined statically.
I've read about it quite a bit but I've never had a reason to use async/await myself. It is certainly something I'd love to be able to say I've used in a useful capacity rather than just playing around with it.
Thanks! I posted there offering my services.
Great! [Here's another fun project just recently posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/760hkq/replace_pyqtgraph_gui_with_physical_switches_for/).
Yes please!
We're not here to do your homework. If you want help, try /r/learnpython - but be willing to learn, and don't expect to get your work done for you.
I'm a psychology graduate, with a background in industrial informatics. During my first semester, I did some voluntary work at my university's laboratory of developmental neuropsychology. Since several psychological tests are printed on paper, there's ground to automate some of them, and especially the evaluation process. Once you have the data in a computer, it's easy to go through the process of evaluation, where sometimes it involves tedious recursive data analysis. I did so with a couple of tests (one involving pygame) during my period of work at this lab.
I'd love to sign up for that
When you're going with serverless, why not go all serverless? If you go with AWS Dynamo DB, you can bring your entire stack up with one [SAM template](https://github.com/awslabs/serverless-application-model) or one [Serverless spec](https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/quick-start/).
I want in! 
I use Visual Studio 2017's community edition for line debugging. It's free and uses IntelliSense to anticipate code errors. You can place breaks and do step overs from the interface. 
you could try the IDLE
Remove anything that appears more than once? You could use a dict, mapping values to the number of times they appear. 
x = list(set(x)) Will remove all duplicate items from x
could you maybe give me a brief example?
but would would only change myList from [1, 2, 2, 4, 5] to [1, 2, 4, 5] what i want to do is change it from [1, 2, 2, 4, 5] to [1, 4, 5]
PythonTutor is amazing for simple enough programs.
Hey, I've somewhat new to python, however I decided that I wanted to start off by doing something with OpenCV, and settled on trying to "automate" Chromes Dino game. After a few days, I have come up with [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vceDabnT3OE). It works pretty good most of the time, however I do have some things that I want to fix/add. *Code is here: https://pastebin.com/it374uWF* 1. When I call the function pyautogui.press(), my application runs much more slowly. You can actually see this in the video when the dinosaur jumps or ducks. It goes from around and update every 0.1s to 0.25, which is pretty severe. Does anyone know how I can fix this? 2. The overall update rate isn't very good either. This is due to the ImageGrab() function I am using. I am wondering if there are any faster ways to capture a screen region that I will be able to implement into my code. 3. All of the values for when to jump are manually put in by me. I have been looking into neural networks and genetic algorithms, and I'm wondering if you think it is possible for me to implement one into this program. The problem right now is that as the game speeds up, the dinosaur doesn't account for that when deciding to jump, and I was hoping that I could solve that problem by implementing a genetic algorithm. I was thinking somewhere along the lines of using the game time as fitness, and when deciding to jump, not only taking into account the distance to the closest cactus, but also how long the game has been going for. I have wanted to learn more about genetic algorithms, so if you have any information/suggestions, that would be amazing. Thanks for any help, I really appreciate it!
You don't have to write 'assert' and it is much easier to write your own matchers. Also I really like that it reads much clearer, as it is always clear what is the value that you expect to be how. This makes it especially easy to provide clear error messages.
Well, he will have to rename it then when he wants to upload it to pypi. :)
What exactly do you expect to be a 'soft assert'? pyexpect does have a mode where it returns a tuple with the first value being True/False (wether the assertion asserted or not) and a string that is the error message. We use this to build validators that need to collect multiple errors.
Yeah I would love that please do share thanks 
What library (link please) do you want it compared with?
&gt; What do you mean by jobs? Most likely he is talking about cron jobs.
Do you have values for how many reps to do of each exercise or something?
google for "python sure" and "python ensure"
Please! 
&gt; I've had a quick play with Hypothesis and it is definitely a useful tool! Thank you for the suggestion :) Do you mind if I ask a few questions about how it works? I could help, and obviously happy to continue :-) &gt; How does the distribution of values from Hypothesis work? There's actually two parts to this. Hypothesis makes no guarantee about the distribution of values - only that it will try to find a (minimal) counterexample to your assertions. This works pretty well, because it *also* uses branch coverage to try to explore all the edge cases in your algorithm. If you think of it as searching for an edge case rather than generating random data, it might be more obvious. However, sometimes it really does focus too much on parts of your input space you don't care about. In these cases, you can actually *combine* strategies using the `one_of` strategy, or just 'bitwise or' (`a|b`). Because Hypothesis takes left-ward strategies as simpler, you can informally specify "look for bugs with inputs from the whole domain, preferring this subset". That would read: `@given(floats(0.1, 1000) | floats(min_value=0))`
You could use a Counter, from the collections module. Iterate through the list counting the number of times each value appears with the Counter, and then check all the items that have more than 1 and delete them. Not the most efficient solution, but I never heard of something that needed to remove all values that were repeated including the original, otherwise a set would work. 
&gt;When I saw this I couldn't believe how complex a simple task could be Welcome to programming. &gt;Then once I've fully absorbed everything youtube-dl has to offer me I'll try to make my own without the help of the code. Would this be a good road map for myself? Probably not. There is a lot there that you have no real need to understand deeply unless you're building something exactly like it. There are hacks which are not particularly nice which you shouldn't really learn from. Best way to learn is to build something real that scratches your (or somebody else's) itch.
I'm trying to make a calculator that uses the finite field algorithm. For one of the parts of the algorithm I need to cancel out all values that are duplicates
Yeah now that I see the comment by u/groovitude that mentioned there have been 500 contributors to this project, which itself was a re-do of an older project, it's *really* not apt to compare yourself to this! 
&gt; Youtube is your friend in learning new stuff. Can't stress this enough. I've been working on my Python lately and found myself wanting to get other things involved into the process (JavaScript, Basic Bootstrap integration). YouTubing things I didn't know along with things I already knew and I was able to get some decent looking stuff (for an amateur) in no time at all. 
 &gt;&gt;&gt; myList = [1,2,2,4,5,6] &gt;&gt;&gt; from collections import Counter &gt;&gt;&gt; non_dupes = [k for k,v in Counter(myList).items() if v==1] &gt;&gt;&gt; print(non_dupes) [1, 4, 5, 6] 
I modified [this comment overwriting script](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/10380-reddit-overwrite) (The one where you see "This comment has been overwritten by an open source script...") to back up my comments to a private S3 bucket before overwriting them. Basically I wanted to delete my comments for personal/privacy/experimental reasons, but didn't want to permanently lose 7 years'/14k karma worth of writing/discussions. The link to request access sends me a PM so I can retrieve the message from S3 and share it with the requestor if I so choose. The unintended consequence of doing this has been that I was quickly banned from a number of subreddits since mods think it's some kind of weird spam. I also have gotten at least one mod message that I believe was triggered by the automod mistakenly thinking the content of the request message link was a form of brigading due to the permalink. 
 list(set(myList)) is what you need..
I'll give you my opinion but you know what opinions are like... With your background, I'm thinking you like applying technology vs the pure science/math aspects of theory. I think a pure math degree is going to be overkill and not something you would like doing. For another perspective, I just saw this interview with Tim Hopper and thought it was really interesting and might apply to your situation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_UrZ4pmKmI Some folks hate on CS degrees because it is sometimes too theoretical. I remember wondering why in the world I would need to understand big-O notation or graph theory. However, I do find that those theoretical basics are useful foundations for better coding. I am not saying it is a requirement but you seem to be interested in getting a degree so if its between CS or Math, I'd go CS. Good luck!
 expect(3).to.equal(4) I dunno man, that's some weird looking python.
Ah. I guess that makes some sense. It certainly looks odd at first. I've never seen someone do anything like that before. I guess you're a pioneer. :)

Yeah, I didn't expect anybody to even notice, much less receive so much negative attention. I'm going to update it tonight to explain what it is a little bit better and think about ways to make it less disruptive to threads while still retaining privacy.
Here is an example for the counter https://pymotw.com/2/collections/counter.html and the result will be each number as the key and the times it is in the list as the value. You can iterate the counter and delete all the keys whose value is 2 or greater. Then you will have the list you want with counter.keys(). The problem is that you will have to iterate the entire list twice, which depending on your performance needs could be slow. 
Awesome! Please send it to me too!
Thank you for your feedback.
Yes, please ! 
Ya'll are over-complicating this by importing a class you don't need. All you need to do is this OP: newList = [] for x in myList: if myList.count(x) &lt; 2: newList.append(x) Not the most efficient way but you don't need to worry about that now. 
I've seen a pretty strong correlation between function size and codebase quality (measured by my enjoyment). I have nothing to back this up with except personal experience. Function names can be self documenting when done right
This is looking like it's going to work. I've already implemented one of the other suggestions that someone posted. I'm going to try this also. Thanks 
Why would you recommend this to someone just learning Python... You don't need to import another entire class for one thing. myList = list(set(myList)) does the same thing with the same 2n run time. 
here's a gist with just celery and beat schedule. this is using version 4.1 so the config variables are all lower case and are a bit different from a lot of tutorials online. https://gist.github.com/zenners/5c76464edeb8b99df4a23ecb6100d310
They all work its just you should avoid importing unnecessary library modules, it just makes your code more complicated than it needs to be. For simple programs of course it doesn't matter, but its not something that beginners should be encouraged to do. Implementing these things without helper classes also helps you learn better. 
Im totally down, thats awesome
Please!
I'd appreciate it!
Just wanna lambda man! Dynamo is cool and all. But for my use case, ETLs lambdas should do me good 
Pls!!!
as everyone else has stated, that would be amazing. Thanks for offering!

This is some really great stuff! Thanks for the post and I will be sharing this with my classmates as well.
Interesting. That verbiage is better. I get it, but from the perspective of another user, it is a little frustrating. You clearly participate a lot, and I think that message interrupts the natural flow of conversation. Then again, if you only did it on older threads, I guess that would work. A newer thread full of that message would drive me nuts. I can see how a tool like that could be useful in certain circumstances.

Why not just use pip?

Yes please! I would much appreciate this.
I'm no new programmer, but I'm new to pythom. I would love if you could share me your assignments for practice.
Thanks for the clarification. Ill be looking more into it. I don't remember the dumb ass who told me that 
In addition to what others have said (pdb, PyCharm), if you want to test some things out and find the interactive console or IDLE to be annoying, check out &lt;a href="http://jupyter.org/install.html"&gt;Jupyter Notebook&lt;/a&gt;. It's a great tool.

You can try it in a virtual environment, which you should use anyway. pip install virtualenv Then I would make a directory for environments and cd into that environment. Next, create a virtualenv with: virtualenv projectname_env I usually give my environments the same name as the project with a `_env` ending. Virtualenv will create a new directory which will include a batch script called `activate.bat`. Use that to activate your virtualenv, then try to install pytest in the virtualenv with pip.
That would be awesome man! Thank you!!!
r/learnpython and read the sidebar.
Nice. May i suggest sharing via a github repo or a series of gists. The different answers could be in separate branches and the questions and answers for a single person could be in the form of different commits. Just a suggestion.
https://learnpythonthehardway.org/
Any URL can be divided into several component parts, the *protocol* (http, https, ftp, file, etc), the *netloc* (an IP address or a DNS entry like www.foo.com that resolves to a specific IP address) which can optionally include a *port*, the *path* (the "directory path"-like structure that limits the focus to the resource being requested, which may go as far as ending in a specific file name), the optional *query* (key=value style questions or attributes to require or potentially set on the resource, this section starts with a ?), and others like *remnants* that tend to be specific to *protocols*. I'd suggest you look at the docs for **urlparse** for all of them.
The first resource that will help you, it's github.com To learn how to program, start your project. Then find a mentor, or just a guy who's more experienced in programming, so that he can advise or guide you in your project. The theory is useless, just practiced.
Where can I find a mentor?
What do you mean by you can't apply what you learned into practice? Are you doing the projects that's part of the course? That's important. Projects really help you feel like you're applying what you've learned so far. Also from looking at the syllabus the course is more of an intro to programming/Python overview course. If you want to make something cool I recommend taking a look at some APIs from some companies that you like and try come up with something using them. http://www.pythonforbeginners.com/api/ 
Yeah, I mean the projects in the course. 
In this week, I release a new version of my Vietnamese natural language processing toolkit underthesea The main feature in this release is named entity recognition. Our experiments focus on conditional random fields models, which yield a reasonable result and fast (~20 mins per experiment) https://github.com/magizbox/underthesea/releases/tag/v1.1.5
"I really want to learn, and to make amazing codes and programs." - it's your quote. Think of a amazing program. And do it. Mentor you can find in community: gitter, forums etc.
Fuck no
Shake off this mentality. I firmly believe that people who are interested in programming have the capacity to be good at it. It's very likely that Udemy's approach just doesn't click with you. Maybe you're one of those people who need googling instead of guidance, for instance. If that's the case, find something *very* hands on and just chip at it. If you're interested in bioinformatics, for example, take a look at Rosalind. Else, buy a raspberry pi and build something with it. If you are a different type, then just keep looking for what fits your style of learning. There's so much various material on Python out there.
Please 
Well I can't access the course material but if you send me the project description I can help push you in the right direction.
Yup. They're in a txt file. Get them -&gt; randomly choose some of them from their respective category (like core exercises or hiit exercises etc) -&gt; store them in another txt file with the date (I guess I'll make pie charts or something at some point) -&gt; do them and adjust the sep x rep count if necessary (haven't finished this part yet)

Nice one! Would love a scoop of that :)
The author of the book is a pompous egotist and has quite unconventional ideas about learning programming, and even though he is engaged in the community, it's a very one-sided engagement. People tell him he's wrong and he just snaps back at them. A while ago he published a blog post pretty much saying that Python 3 is a horrible language, even though the consensus is the opposite (plus Python 2 is going to be end-of-lifed in 2020). Then he reluctantly updated his book and made it non-free in what I suppose was a retaliation (?). More importantly and objectively, his whole idea of teaching a language is "type everything exactly as I write it here and don't ask questions" instead of "figure stuff out by applying what I've taught you." To the point where he literally says people should *memorize* truth tables ([here's a snapshot of the page](https://web.archive.org/web/20170707220609/https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex27.html) from before he pulled the book from free access). I really can't understand how anyone could benefit from this approach and I from what you've said I have an inkling it's definitely not how you personally would want to learn to code, either.
You can present the board as a list of row lists. Since tic-tac-toe uses a 3x3 board it will be this: board = [[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]] Which when printed out will look like: [0, 0, 0] [0, 0, 0] [0, 0, 0] So lets say a player wants to mark the bottom left corner as 'X'. The is the 0th index of 3rd row. So you access it using board[3][0] = 'X'. The first number when you index your board refers to the row, and the second number refers to the column. Think y and x on a graph, y = 3 and x = 0. So now the board will look like this: [0, 0, 0] [0, 0, 0] [X, 0, 0] So read input from the console and convert that input into row and column indexes. Write something like: "Player X Enter Move in the form of (Row, Column): ". Then take the row and column values and use that to update the board for each turn.
Thank you! ^_^
You reminded me: I also made 2 GUI programs with PyQT5 &amp; cx_Freeze. Our front-end application wasn't great for inputting recurring things or downloading all reports per customer contract (had to be done manually per order). I also played with openpyxl, but most of the Excel reports I made had an embedded SQL query (people wanted to pull instead of push).
[Requests] (http://docs.python-requests.org/) is pretty useful imo

It'd probably be better to post this on /r/learnpython instead.

Depends on what you need to do. Look here for the top libraries for the most common tasks: https://github.com/vinta/awesome-python
Thx for the Lough haha
yeah, i typed them by hand
Not bad. :)
I’ve been working on automatically updating plugins for our Minecraft server, as that’s the most boring part.
About your third point, I have seen that approach previously, I hope it helps: https://youtu.be/P7XHzqZjXQs 
Yeah what do you need? What we're doing isn't very hard, just turning a deeply nested object into a flat one, not sure it's really the most exciting use case of anything really. More just something we have to do for backwards compatibility reasons. 
Pretty sure it works through pip these days.
I second pudb very highly. It gives you a "graphical" session but in the terminal, so it's not much extra to get it going.
**or** *dons wizard hat and begins laughing manically* ... from functools import partial @partial(lambda gen: lambda *args, **kwargs: list(gen(*args, **kwargs))) def fib(n): a, b = 0, 1 for _ in range(n): yield a a, b = b, a + b fib(8) # -&gt; [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13]
Thanks for the practice! How should we reply, by posting on gist?
Yeah, but that statement was towards the fact that full OpenCV functionality only works on Windows from `opencv-python`. HighGUI didn't used to install with it for Linux or Mac, and now that HighGUI is supported FFMPEG is still not linked for Linux or Mac. So IOW it's a good Windows installer.
[PyFilesystem](https://www.pyfilesystem.org) is maybe not the most important, but good to know about.
If you want to do smart prosthetics, you want to do a robotics degree at an institution that does research on smart prosthetics. That way, there is a chance there will be classes on that kind of bio-med engineering.
Thanks!
Maybe if you do something entertaining it motives you to spend more time on it, and by extension you'll get better at it. People here might boo at me but I'm going to suggest you take a look at Godot Engine. It's a game engine &amp; editor like Unity which features a scripting language that looks like Python (not saying it is Python). With that you can visually see what you're building and it won't be too abstract. And it might even be fun to play with. However, this is good only as a starter. Because once you go deeper you'll find big non transferable differences between the engine and Python. For this reason you should switch on Python when you're comfortable with the basics of procedural and object programming.
find you a job or stage, any kind of occupation with commercial purpose, after, you must code :)

The libraries everyone *should* know at least the basics of (in roughly this order, although that gets fuzzier pad subprocess): 1. os 2. sys 3. logging 4. subprocess 5. re 6. itertools 7. collections 8. functools 9. urllib 10. math 11. pickle 12. json 13. inspect 14. string 15. atexit There are certainly many others, but those give you the ability to read and understand the source of most others. Beyond the standard library it's all up to your interest and domain.
Just to go coursera, find python courses, look for course made by chuck severance and go through it, its very good for beginners
A lot of people encourage you to think of a simple program and implement it. I think it's a good idea. Start with really simple projects, I mean, really simple (simpler than tick-tack-toe), and implement it. And start raising the bar a little with projects that are just a little bit harder than the previous one. If you decide to do so, than let me know, you can send me a link to your github, I think I will be able to spend a while reviewing your code. I program since I was a kid and have 2 years of professional experience.
There are also services like code-wars, most of them are strictly about resolving some algorithms problems, but most of them are also created like they were a games. You can check it, but disadvantages of these services is that problems you solve won't be very practical for you.
Is it only HTML parsing with regular expressions that summon Zalgo? I don't hope anyone think that this cover all valid email addresses.
If it bothers you, you can use *.gitattributes* to force github to make you a Python developer again. https://github.com/github/linguist#overrides
It depends: do you want "standard" or "best"? For line-by-line execution, Spyder or any Python IDE works well. It works essentially the same as in Visual Studio, so some (most?) would call this "standard". Others think that we can do better than this: Jupyter notebooks, or the Hydrogen plugin of the Atom text editor.
You are starting brackets which you are not closing. Make sure each bracket is in a pair. Also not sure why the dictionary is in a list? 
1. Please see [r/learnpython](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython). 2. Just count the number of brackets `{` and `}` that you have and you'll soon see where you're going wrong.
Should look like this: grades = {"Susan": [45,37,54], "Peter": [62,58,59], "Mark": [49,47,60], "Andy": [78,8,62]} print(grades) 
Programming is like science: stand on the shoulders of giants. Instead of learning every part of youtube-dl, you could just learn its API and incorporate it in your own GUI app. 
You can write it like this too: expect(3) == 4
God thanks! This is really usefull for learning 
These look like nice libraries with a similar take. Will take al look - thanks for the heads up.
Sounds like a good idea, i havent used that yet tho. I will figure that out this weekend, gotta mention im not an experienced programmer myself. 
It may be a barrier for the students to install Python the way you describe it. On Linux, the first option (install from source) is not something I would advise. Your CS students could be better at it than mine, though. A much lower barrier is to run it through the browser via Jupyter (https://try.jupyter.org/). You could convert the entire tutorial into a Jupyter notebook. 
Like the idea thanks
I think those of us who've been programming a while think that "think of an amazing program" is an easy step. But it takes a lot of experience to learn what's *possible*, what's practically *achievable*, and get into the mindset of seeing things that a new program could solve.
IMO programming is a means to an end, so its important to have a goal. Think of something you want to build and then work towards building it.
"Regex" and "e-mail address" should never ever be in the same sentence. E-mails are so complex that any attempt a validating patterns will either be utterly pointless or exlude perfecly valid addresses. There is one and only one way to validate an address: sending a confirmation e-mail.
venv already ships with python now. python -m venv virtualenv Gets you a venv called virtualenv.
It could be painful, but why not use fabric to copy python script to remote server and execute all you need there? Maybe also good way is to send all data to some centralized storage
I had my problems but I never had to install anaconda.
Yea this what figured. In the mean time I'm still at the beginning stages of programming and haven't met much resistance. But I believe once I get more into it I'll need an operating system that is easier to interface with. 
I use idle and I have no problems. I dont know how to fully utilize the program though.
I had the same problem. It took me about a week to set everything up correctly. You'll find this to be true with any langauge. It always a bitch to set it up for the first time.
We're already using puppet to handle the CM of these systems, so I could easily distribute a set of python scripts across the nodes. I guess my question is that I'm trying to understand the model of fabric - are 'shell commands' through ssh the only things that are actually executed on the remote host? 
(This post belongs in /r/learnpython) What have you tried? Normally, you'd spawn 10 workers and each worker would in an endless loop take one item from the queue, work on it, and when finished, pick the next one; i.e. it would never stop. You'd have to wrap the processing part in a try/except to catch any exceptions (and log them!) so that it does not stop even in case of an error.
Programming teacher here (not yours, but I do give a BMI assignment later in the semester.) Please be sure to clear this project with your professor. He or she may take a dim view of this project. While I’m sure your intentions are well-meaning, you’ve just created massive headaches for your teacher, because now you’ve created a dandy tool for people who don’t want to do the assignment themselves. I see my assignments posted online all the time, and it simply adds to the database of code I have to check against to ensure students are doing their own work. When the instructor discovers that you have (good intentions or not) simplified cheating and increased his or her workload to prevent cheating, this could be a problem for you. TL;DR: Let your professor know you’re doing this, because he or she will find out and might be quite annoyed.
Good advice, I will talk to him. Haven’t thought about that. 
Good advice, I will talk to him. Haven’t thought about that. 
Well, If I understood you right let me just show to you peace of fabric documentation: "It provides a basic suite of operations for executing local or remote shell commands (normally or via sudo) and uploading/downloading files, as well as auxiliary functionality such as prompting the running user for input, or aborting execution.". So, yes fabric allows to execute shell command remotelly via ssh, uploading/downloading files.
Well, next steps: 1. use generator 2. use python3 style 3. check carefuly your code and get off all useless things)))
I have a coroutine while True loop that takes an item from queue, checks the item processing rate (simply by semaphore acquire), and creates a worker task to process that. 
Newbie here. While I am (re-)teaching myself Python, I am creating CYOA games for my kids. They really loved it, so now I am putting together a CYOA/RPG for my older kid's upcoming birthday. I have already incorporated a version of hangman and guess the number in the game. Any other ideas on mini-games that I both learn how to program and incorporate into the overall game?
Simplicity is always elegant. Thanks for sharing 
This is a job for configuration management. Look into Ansible, it can execute commands and report things back.
Nice post, Matt! 
Maybe you will right
I've used a generator while solving an Euler project problem, my limited knowledge on them makes them look sketchy, but I will go into them more deeply. Py 3, I will switch over the weekend, as I will have a lot of time to get familiar with it. Thanks!
I wrapped quite some Fortran code and made it accessible to C and Python. However, for this code, I would advise you not to do it at all. It's just not acceptable anymore to read values from an input prompt. Better to study the Fortran until you understand what the program exactly does, and then write it anew. With something like [numpy.random.choice], (https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.13.0/reference/generated/numpy.random.choice.html), it could be very short script. My old professor was very amazed when I replaced his old Fortran eigenvector diagonalization code with a single Python call into numpy.linalg.svd (which itself calls into a Fortran library) that ran much faster.
Ansible or Saltstack , you might use salt without installing minions by using salt-ssh. 
When I'm learning some new language or library, I always try to change bits and pieces. I loosely follow along with the tutorial and and add extra elements to the code to do something like convert this to that. I find I learn more from experimenting than blindly following the tutorials, no matter if they are pdf, magazine, video etc.
I'm not an Airflow expert. The airflow website (https://airflow.incubator.apache.org/) does state: "Airflow is not a data streaming solution" It's the first line in the "Beyond the Horizon" section: https://airflow.incubator.apache.org/#beyond-the-horizon 
&gt; chuck severance nice... here's his website with links to the books and courses, including the free ones. [link](http://www.dr-chuck.com/)
use a framework like bottle or flask to process your request?
At least you could precheck it is a posible email address. Something like this I guess: .+@.+\.
No, it's because the "programmer owns the dot". JS and Lua also have add, substract, etc methods, but you can JIT them away. Not so with Python. PyPy's JIT does a decent job, but it's a very hard problem.
interesting, will try something similar using flask. I googled quickly to see if you have [notebook support](https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide/notebook.html) but google only returned links to old docs. There is a warning with link to latest. but the link does not copy the path of the current page so I start at the index again :/ If the url was just changed from [../0.10.0/..](https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/0.10.0/docs/user_guide/notebook.html) to [../latest/..](https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/0.10.0/docs/user_guide/notebook.html) I would be able to use this awesome lib quicker. Just a suggestion.
The programmer owns the dot in every language that has a dot.
Start projects! I myself am very project based, and it helps loads. Plus, it'll look good to have a lot of completed projects, big or small, under your belt. What I've done is coded and designed my own website, and put all my projects up there along with my other non-computing work. As well as that, I've tried to complete as many courses as I can, online, free, in real life, etc. It all looks very good imo. And because you're putting your projects up online, it'll force you to make them good and high quality. Shove in a bunch of fancy documentation, processes, updates, etc, as well as the program itself. Also, enter competitions! Win or lose, it's one more thing you can add to your library. So hopefully by the end, your website will almost be looking like a CV, with a bunch of stuff you can be proud of! Fill it with projects, courses you've done (bonus points if you travel somewhere fancy to do a course, for sure add that), competitions you've entered, etc! Hopefully this helps =]
That doesn't match the entirly valid address postmaster 
Depends on the company. My company would want experience with custom data parsing, numpy, and desktop gui development. It's assumed things like the standard library and how to use all the major features of python (e.g., list comprehensions) is clear. A web-based company would have very different requirements.
Thanks for your reply. I can see that. My work has my working with Google App Script these days, but I feel like Python would be more valuable since it has so many packages 
I cringe whenever I see string imported. Someone doesn't know about split.
Not so. In C, for struct S {float x; float y;} s; s.x is syntactic sugar for *( (float *) s ), and s.y for *( (float *)(s) + 1). 
I find it very hard to learn programming except by doing something. Find a simple problem you actually want to solve. It could be a simple website, a numerical problem, searching text.... A lot of interesting problems require learning Python plus a library for that problem. It sounds that at least you are not suffering from Dunning-Kruger syndrome. I do not think you are going to learn that much in two months unless you are an absolute genius, so I think its good that you know you do not know much yet. Find an approach that interests you and keep going.
It's for the constants and **maketrans**, which are bloody useful, the latter being worth its weigh in gold. If code had mass.
Raspberry Pi or repurposing some old computer if the task is frequent or suitably intensive. If it is light and/or infrequent, you should figure out some device that is already running for other reasons. Some cloud services do allow you to pay based on use though and thus could be a good fit for an infrequent light process that still needs to happen reliably. I think Amazon's has a cost structure like that, even.
python (2.7 or 3 ) is pre-installed in linux Os and bsd you need to donwload and install python for windows
Create a [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) and install it in that virtual environment. In order to use it you will need to be in that environment. &gt; python -m venv venv &gt; call venv\Scripts\activate.bat &gt; pip install pytest 
I've never heard of HighGUI. I'm a python dev, but know someone that teaches it, is it something worth checking out for beginners.
If it's a company that builds web applications, they'll be wanting to see things like Django, Flask, celery etc etc If it's a data shop, scipy, numpy, pandas, matplotlib, sklearn, theano etc etc It's really going to depend on what the company does and what they want you to do.
Depends entirely on what the company needs. [This job listing](http://www.indeed.com/cmp/Tata-Technologies/jobs/System-Integration-Engineer-1e29753469717893?sjdu=QwrRXKrqZ3CNX5W-O9jEvSACnHMP3BfocKn5vCZ5XEhhK36D7g1kKfIA7LROBotDo5eBZNrEaFAtKEgu6dL8Xsh9489SMPljn4Ur0a4fw2k) is going to have an entirely different set of requirements than some generic webdev position.
that is fantastic. 
[set_xlimit](https://matplotlib.org/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.axes.Axes.set_xlim.html) is not working?
The bad news is `maketrans` is gone from the `string` module. The good news is that, quoting from [other language changes](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.1.html#other-language-changes), *Now, str, bytes, and bytearray each have their own maketrans and translate methods with intermediate translation tables of the appropriate type* :-)
They will be looking for what they think they need. This varies wildly between companies and positions, so it really is impossible to tell. From what you describe, a junior-level job that doesn't require any particular in-depth knowledge should be right up your alley; from there, you will learn things on the job as you need them. Beyond the job ad, the established way of finding out whether you would be a good fit for the job is to apply; and if they end up rejecting you, don't be afraid to ask why, and what you could work on to be mire hireable.
Lol I think you're getting something mixed up. QT maybe? HighGUI is just part of the OpenCV library. The GUI part that contains the functions like `imshow` and trackbars and such.
ax.set_xlim(0, 1000) if its a subplot or plt.xlim(0, 1000) if you have just called plt.plot(x, y).
Thanks for your try to help! I already have installed python3 pip and all needed modules.
Doh - I've never got further with OpenCV than trying out some examples.
You could use fabric to send a python script that prints out your data to the stout and you parse it. JSON would be a good format. If might look into http://rpyc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ Also check out other rpc methods https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1879971/what-is-the-current-choice-for-doing-rpc-in-python
Training videos and books can help at the beginning, but the real way to learn is to pick one small challenge at a time that does something useful for you. For instance, reading a CSV, adding a column, then writing it to disk in a new file. Or downloading a web page and extracting a chunk of text. Copying and pasting from Stack Overflow is A-OK. Also, try to think of unexpected errors as fun little puzzles that give you a chance to learn something new. If you get frustrated, take a break and come back to it the next day. Good luck!
That's neat. I wish Google Fit had all the data points that Apple Health does. It's mostly just steps, sleep, and a few other things.
Hi, thanks for the feedback :) That's a pretty cool idea. I'll have a look into this more. Actually, most of the people in my class (classmates, not students, sorry if that was inferred) use Windows, but as I use linux I thought I 'd put it in there. Maybe it would be a better idea to put the package manager stuff beforehand?
Thanks guys! I can't believe I didn't think of that... Appreciate your help. :)
So are they in the process of creating the course ?
https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html You should know all python standart library!
Heh. Nifty. 
schwifty?
Hmm ok. If I just provisioned the module to all the nodes I wouldn't even need to send it then I could call and parse. Gotcha.
 fibs = 0 : 1 : zipWith (+) fibs (tail fibs) fib n = take n fibs fib 8 [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13] Why I love Haskell. 
Ahh, the never ending problems of still straddling two worlds.
Can anyone explain to me how this decorator and these lambda's work? I can see what is happening and why you get the result you get, but I don't understand what's happening exactly.
Thanks a lot, appreciated.
For starters, `functools.partial` is a function that returns a function, and **most** decorators are functions that return other functions def add(x, y): return x + y add3 = partial(add, 3) add3(5) # -&gt; 8 All decorators take a function as an argument def printname(func): print(func.__name__) return func @printname def return_true(): return True #return_true Decorators that wrap functions with arguments must have at least two functions, one that takes the decorated function as an argument and another function that takes the decorated function's arguments as its arguments. def print_func_and_args(func): print(func.__name__) def wrap_args(*args, **kwargs): print(args, kwargs) return func(*args, **kwargs) return wrap_args @print_func_and_args def power(n, k=1): return n**k power(9, k=2) #power #(9,) {'k': 2} 81 Generator functions return iterators def powers_of_two(n): for i in range(n): yield i**2 gen = powers_of_two(5) print(gen) list(gen) #&lt;generator object powers_of_two at 0x10ffcfc50&gt; [0, 1, 4, 9, 16] To recap 1. `functools.partial` takes a function as a parameter and returns another function 2. decorators wrap functions and take them as parameters, returning something else (usually another function). 3. generator functions return iterators --- def add2(x): return x + 2 add3 = partial(lambda n: n + 3) add5 = partial(lambda n: add3(add2(n))) @partial(lambda f: lambda n: add3(f(n))) def alt_add_5(n): return n + 2 print(add5(1) == alt_add_5(1)) #True from functools import partial @partial(lambda gen: lambda n: list(gen(n))) def fib(n): a, b = 0, 1 for _ in range(n): yield a a, b = b, a + b fib(8) # -&gt; [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13] [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13] 
I might also add that it takes some use of lambdas, partial, decorators etc. for it all to sink in. It took me a long time to become relatively comfortable with those concepts and others, so don't feel discouraged if it doesn't make sense at first and always feel free to ask questions.
I assume you have a numpy array? You can just set the shape: data.shape = -1, 3 --- If you have more questions like this it's better to post them on /r/learnpython. Be sure to [format your code for reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/faq#wiki_how_do_i_format_code.3F) or use a site like pastebin. Also, include which version of python and what OS you are using. 
Isn't maketrans, just a fancy replace? I'll occasionally do something like replace spaces with question marks in something that can't have question marks, so I can process it easier before I remove the question mark. I've also done things like `str.replace(' ', ','.replace('\t', ',')`, but that's fairly rare.
This code would take me a lot less time to process: def fib(): a, b = 0, 1 while True: yield a a, b = b, a + b list(itertools.islice(fib(), 0, 8)) 
I've always used `fibs = scanl (+) 0 (1:fibs)`
I agree that's the better way in most instances, but I think it's cool that you can do it the decorator way as well
Yeah, I hate it when Google points to the old version but then I can't find the relevant section in the new!
I don't believe the author of this blog post is actually associated with Bokeh.
nope, just a fan :)
Hello /r/Python! After lurking here for some time, I now published my first project and wanted to share. paw is a pattern and wordlist generator written in Python. While popular wordlist generators mostly offer only a limited number of custom charsets besides standardized ones, paw allows for customized charset at each position.
For the tasks it's suited for (for instance replacing all terminal punctuation with white space for word splitting, or breaking Caesar ciphers) it's more powerful by far than **str.replace** and sometimes orders of magnitude faster than **re.sub** ... it isn't always the right fit, but when it is it's exactly the right tool.
Thank you for the suggestions. 
Hah, try to explain this too all the customers I worked for.
How about this? A bit more general. from functools import partial wrap = lambda f: partial(lambda gen: lambda n: f(gen(n))) @wrap(list) def fib(n): a, b = 0, 1 for _ in range(n): yield a a, b = b, a + b fib(8) # -&gt; [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13]
yeah the possibilities are endless, really. 
The first one that comes to mind is no protection against zero division error, if D=0 you'll crash. You can create an if statement or a try/except block to catch this. Also you might as well download python 3 if you're just starting, no point getting familiar with a basically deprecated version. Good luck, looks good. 
`firefox --screenshot https://url.com/ --window-size=1920` should do it, if you have Firefox 57 or newer - that is, beta/nightly.
`firefox --screenshot https://url.com/ --window-size=1920` should do it, if you have Firefox 57 or newer - that is, beta/nightly.
I think the partial decorator would work well for closures where it's not something that's meant to be interacted with directly. For other use-cases it's probably better to use explicit function composition, itertools, comprehensions, or a more robust decorator like the one you wrote.
&gt;PhantomJS dropped python support What do you mean? It still works. https://pythonspot.com/en/selenium-take-screenshot/
Thanks! I've added multi threading now to make it smoother, just gotta work on sorting them by release date now.
But there should be only one way. 🤔
I'm not an airplane hobbyist, but kudos for writing what looks like quite detailed documentation, and for building binaries to make it easier for users to use. Your project looks very slick - I don't think you need a disclaimer about not being a developer by trade. ;-)
There are two main approaches to making an app: web apps and native. **Django** is a Python framework for making web apps. Python runs on the server, and people access it through the web. The good news is that a lot of people use Python for web apps, so there's a lot of tools and information about doing that. The bad news is that it won't really work when a user doesn't have internet access, and that you'll probably need to use Javascript as well: that's another programming language, which can run in the web browser. **Kivy** is a framework for native apps, especially mobile-style apps. This is the path less trodden - not many mobile or desktop apps are written in Python (except some Linux desktop apps). But Kivy is quite actively developed, and it lets you write an app entirely in Python. SQL is a language for talking to databases. You might need that, depending on what your app does. But I'd recommend you leave it for now - you can always learn about it when you find you need it.
Thank you. I appreciate the feedback.
Your python seems running, as you have &gt;&gt;&gt; means thats you have interpreter working. As for those error messages that seems related to powershell. Quik google didnt give good copy/paste solution right off the bat.
According to [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22390395/python-script-in-powershell-remote-exception-and-nativecommanderror) stackoverflow post the solution should be redirecting stderr like this: python 2&gt;$null
Sometimes you install Python on Windows and it doesn't configure the path correctly. Make sure you enter [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("Path", "$env:Path;C:\Python27", "User") in PowerShell to configure it correctly. You also have to either restart PowerShell or your whole computer to get it to really be fixed. Source: https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex0.html in your case you need to replace "C:\Python27" with the install path of your python 3.6
Aren't you trying to run python from Windows Powershell ISE by any chance? If so, try to run from Windows Powershell (no ISE).
&gt; python(the language i want) Well, there you have your first problem. A language is a tool and while preference plays a role I'd suggest never to grab to one language and let it go. If there is a framework or library compatible with the language you use, be my guest but if there are better alternatives maybe you should see somewhere else. Case in point: Django is a great framework to develop web applications, but there aren't many alternatives to develop mobile apps using Python, not that I'm aware of at least.
Fair enough. Rock on man!
Just keep at it. Try to make simple stuff you or someone you know may want to use. I'ts ok if you don't remember the syntax, a programmer is going to read a lot of documentation and examples when doing something new.
I'll try that, thanks. I didn't realise PowerShell (non-ISE) existed. I presumed the version I'd been using was the only version. 
[OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) is probably going to be important. This blog has a lot of information about setting it up and using it: https://www.pyimagesearch.com/ (The most recent posts are about deep learning, which you probably don't want, at least for now. But that's not the whole blog)

Convincing application. Working for free 
jo u/sjdv1982 - so, i agree with you that if it were for a *practical* purpose, it would be a waste of time. however, its for fun. the guy i know is a professor of mine but hes more like a grandpa to me, and this is a way for us to have fun and communicate. also, it may interest you to know im changing the script totally, not going line by line. for instance, im using OptionParser to take user arguments and im reading the values from a file. anyway bud, i agree, just tryna have a little fun wit it. thx 
I would think so. Anyway, I think that python3 is pre-installed for the major Linux distros nowadays (python2 definitely is). By the way, you can execute shell commands inside IPython/Jupyter, although sudo is a bit harder: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44996933/using-sudo-inside-jupyter-notebooks-cell
Cool! I’ll have a look. 
finPoly[0] is 12, so your code is actually trying to do "for i in 12". The "TypeError: 'int' object is not iterable" is telling you that you can't do that, because integers are not iterable (you can't for loop through them). What you need to do is use the range() function. for i in range(0, finPoly[0], 1) The range function takes 3 parameters, start value, stop value, and step amount. The code above says start at 0, stop at finPoly[0] (which is 12), increment i by 1 each time. Note the start and step arguments are optional, I just included them to help explain. You can just do for i in range(finPoly[0]) for looping through the Python range function is a for loop in other languages. You see them as for (int i = 0; i &lt; n; i ++) While "for i in iterable" in Python is the "for each" loop in other languages.
Kivy is an opengl toolkit with its own opengl-based drawing api that you can use, and in principle you could use its low level opengl bindings more broadly. If you just want to make a mobile-compatible app using opengl, you can do this using [python-for-android](https://github.com/kivy/python-for-android) - this is Kivy's Android build tool, but it isn't actually limited to Kivy. If you build an app with the (default) SDL2 backend, which is what Kivy would also use, you should be able to use pyopengl just fine. You'd also want to use something like pysdl2 to manage the sdl2 window.
Thank you sir
Thank you for your answer! I am glad to hear this since it almost looks like black magic to me \^\^
That's all of us at one point or another :)
You might consider a package called pickle, and store your info in a dict. Or, learn SQL/an SQL interface. Cool project!
Selenium is the new phantomjs.
One liners are always fun to come up with but you should be careful because they tend to encourage bad runtime complexity. For example your code first calls the key_func on all elements in args to generate the set, sorts the set, and then calls key_func for every arg again for every key. Lets say the elements in args is N. This leads you to having the run time of key_func multiplied by N + n log n + the run time of key_func times N times N keys, or rather O(key_func) * N + O(n log n) + O(key_func) * O(N) * (N). Throwing out the lower terms, this is polynomial O(N ^ 2) at best is key_func is O(1), and could be a lot worse depending on the key_func is. If key_func is O(N) then this is a O(N ^ 3) function. You can do a lot better than this by using a defaultdict. output = defaultdict(list) for arg in args: output[key_func(arg)].append(arg) Appending a list is O(1) so the runtime for this is O(1) + O(N * key_func), and throwing out lower terms gives O(N * key_func). That's a big difference in performance. If N is 100, your function has to do 10000000000 * key_func computations, while the other method only requires 100 * key_func. Something to keep in mind as you go forward.
I am actually using pygame. Would that work? Could probably change to sdl 
Suggest.... Accept / decline.... Follow up "was toss the right time between cleanings.... Machine learning to settle on accurate cleaning schedules rather than self defined ones 
Alternatively, just cache the results of key_func and you only get the overhead of a dict lookup and function calls (which are non-trivial in Python and are worth mentioning here, I think). I still think your solution is more elegant overall
I'll follow this advice in the future. Thanks for the wise words.
... Um....
First you need to open your file in append mode: with open("somefile.txt", "a") as f: Then you can write to the end of the file: f.write("X: {:&gt;4} Y: {:&gt;4}".format(x, y))
Bored, so here's a stab: from collections import defaultdict, OrderedDict from itertools import chain data = OrderedDict() with open('tocsv.data', 'rb') as fh: current = None for line in fh: line = line.strip() if '=' not in line: current = line else: key, val = line.split(' = ', 1) data.setdefault(current, defaultdict(lambda: '?')).update({key: val}) #print repr(data) unique_keys = set(chain.from_iterable(v.keys() for v in data.values())) fields = sorted(unique_keys) print print ', '.join(['time']+fields) for row_time, row_vals in data.iteritems(): print ', '.join([row_time] + [row_vals[f] for f in fields]) 
I'm still rather green at Python (1ish year) and taking a course in Python right now as part of my master's in InfoSec. Currently, I'm learning about sets (intersect, difference, and unions). Kinda went over some of those concepts when I was hanging out on Treehouse and flipping through SQL stuff. So while I have a quiz over sets and dictionaries come Monday, I'm reading through Automate the Boring Stuff. I might flunk my quiz, but I'm learning what I want to learn and trying to convert my AutoHotKey scripts to Python.
Was the deleted comment something along the lines of, "You should get what they were paying him?" Because you should or at least half.
Just a note, there is a full python API to plotly. The claim that you need JS for plotly is false.
Hi! Here's two quick points: - Package your code. Your git repo appears to be just a folder of files; I think it's better to use some sort of packaging utility. Here's a really basic example I wrote for one of my projects: https://github.com/dpedu/datadb-cli/blob/master/setup.py. The benefits from doing this are various, but I'll list what I feel are the most important: &gt; 1) how your program is installed becomes obvious (as setuptool's setup.py is easily recognized by any python professional). &gt; 2) Your code is installed as a module, meaning other people can import your code and make more cool stuff. &gt; 3) setuptools will automatically add programs to your $PATH. E.g. instead of typing "python ./path/to/scanner.py", you could define a "runmyscanner" item and launch your scanner by only typing "runmyscanner". - There's "unprotected" code in scanner.py. What I mean is, code that executes as soon as the file is loaded. Or to be clearer, code outside of methods or other checks. This is a problem because if someone imports code from your module, it will start doing things! Common practice is to wrap code like your: subnets=(item.split('|') for item in open('subnets.txt','r').readlines()) [scan_network(subnet) for subnet in subnets] #scans every network in the list Inside of a check like: if __name__ == "__main__": subnets=(item.split('|') for item in open('subnets.txt','r').readlines()) [scan_network(subnet) for subnet in subnets] If someone runs `python ./myfile.py`, then `__name__` will be equal to `__main__`. Otherwise, e.g. if someone imports your code, `__name__` will be something else. I think these two points are the most important. Some more nitpicking below: - Your `get_node_data` method returns a string by concating the data it gathers. It would be better code (because it would be more easily reusable) if this method returned the values in a list. If you REALLY need them in a single string, it's trivial to combine them later. - (I know I told you to change this but) the way you combined multiple values into a string is more typing than you had to do: return '%s|%s|%s|%s|%s'%(node_data[0],node_data[1],node_data[2],node_data[3],node_data[4]) This could be better expressed as: return '|'.join(node_data) + "\n" Assuming node_data has only 5 entries. If there's more, you could write `node_data[0:4]` instead. You seem to pass around data like this a lot, passing lists (or even more complex data structures) is better. - If all you're doing with subprocesses is running a simple command and reading output, `subprocess.check_output` could reduce each of your sub command calls to 1 line instead of 2. - In your `scan_network` method, you have a `try...except` block that catches ALL exceptions. It's good practice to catch only specific exceptions relevant to what your method is doing. - You have this check - ` if len(net_scan)&gt;1:` in the `scan_network` method. I think you meant to write `=&gt;` instead so that when there's data available it prints the progress. The way you wrote it, it waits for two entries to appear instead of one and I don't really see a reason why. I bring this up because you could instead write ` if net_scan:` because empty lists will evaluate to false. And it's cleaner code.

Selenium cant do this because it relies on both of the above drivers as far as I know. I can only take a screenshot of the active frame, not the full webpage.
Importing a class hardly complicates things, especially a standard library class, but it's easy to just use a dict for the same job. Using an O(n^2) solution just to avoid importing a standard library class is a terrible tradeoff.
OP is clearly a beginner so encouraging him to use library classes to solve problems before he develops a strong grasp of the basic data structures isn't a good way to learn. The other solution in this thread included list comprehensions and argument unpacking. A suboptimal solution that show cases the features of lists vs throwing all that other stuff at him will help him learn better. 
Yep. And yes we are actually in negotiations over it.
Also note that there is `itertools.groupby` in the standard library (though it is lazy instead of creating a dict in memory, so it can handle large inputs).
Pointing beginners at newbie-traps like `list.count` when you could teach them to use a dict just builds bad habits, though. You could have posted the dict-based solution, or the sort-based solution (which has its own merits that may sometimes even make it outperform the Counter/dict, particularly for adversarial input).
The data format looks very similar to [INI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file). The only exception being the section headers. If you're able to manipulate/make copies of the files, you might consider simply wrapping each section header in square brackets (`[]`), then using Python's [configparser](https://docs.python.org/3/library/configparser.html) module to handle all the parsing for you. For example, this: Time0 key1 = 25 key2 = 30 key3 = 10 Time1 key1 = 20 key2 = 10 key3 = 15 ...would become: [Time0] key1 = 25 key2 = 30 key3 = 10 [Time1] key1 = 20 key2 = 10 key3 = 15 Then, in your Python script, something like: from configparser import ConfigParser cfg = ConfigParser() cfg.read('path/to/data.dat') rows = [] for section in cfg.sections(): rows.append(tuple(cfg[section].values())) ...which would yield: [('25', '30', '10'), ('20', '10', '15')] From there, saving data to a CSV format is simple: Use Python's [CSV](https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html) module to write your data to a file. Something like: import csv with open('path/to/new/data.csv', 'w') as csvfile: writer = csv.writer(csvfile) writer.writerow('key1', 'key2', 'key3') # Header writer.writerows(rows) # Data
**INI file** The INI file format is an informal standard for configuration files for some platforms or software. INI files are simple text files with a basic structure composed of sections, properties, and values. In MS-DOS and 16-bit Windows platforms up through Windows ME, the INI file served as the primary mechanism to configure operating system and installed applications features, such as device drivers, fonts, startup launchers, and things that needed to be initialized in booting Windows. INI files were also generally used by applications to store their individual settings. *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Python/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.27
Opencv is quite good. Also check out [pillow](https://python-pillow.org/), which is oriented more toward image processing and manipulation them computer vision.
Coverage.py is the de facto standard coverage library. Use it. Unittest is part of the standard library; however, I am writing new tests with py.test. Previously we used nose, but it is pretty much dead. Pytest is a bit more functional (literally, you can just have functions) which leads to cleaner tests (although that’s subjective). It is also explicit about dependencies (fixtures). Some inexperienced developers tend to treat unittest’s setUp method like a constructor, injecting a bag of state that ultimately leads to poorly-understood tests. All of py.test’s fixtures are injected as arguments, so you know pretty much exactly what’s going on for each test case. 
THIS WORKS , but it creates too large of a file with 1000's of X Y cords .......... How would i make it only write x, y to the file with a click ????????? THANK YOU SO MUCH THAT HELPED ME SO MUCH !!!!!!!!
Thank you, this is very helpful. Would you say pytest is the best place to start?
Yes, start with py.test. 
To monitor clicks, you'll need an object that will call a function when it is clicked. This could be a GUI like tkinter or PyQt or you could use something like Pynput.
Correct one right? https://t.co/8R8dfh8IBu
&gt; OK, so I'm doing the course "Learn Python the Hard Way" Seeing that your question has been answered I'll just point out that there are vastly superior resources to this one.

If you have the images as multi-layer/channel TIF files I can help you out (I'll have to PM that or something). My labmate and I developed a macro in ImageJ to do just that, the data analysis itself I do in python which you can find [here](https://github.com/tentekal/backgroundSubtraction). Let me know if you need any help, I struggled with this alone for many months before I got the scripts/tools I needed! 
Have you done sometjinglike this? I have a crude version of what he has set up for himself but there are a few things where I am taking to short or long nd haven't figured out the exact timing yet. On the other hand I have discovered it is simplest if I do dishes every day. 
Checking in and out of work. Program&gt; Logs into the ADP portal using selenium: Starts: outlook, skype for business, chrome, flux, Spyder and the CNTLM proxy Ends: Logs out and checks time spent logged on. At the end of the week tells me how close I am to 40 hours and when I can leave work. 
What do you mean by convincing application? Haven't looked at open source projects yet but plan on it. Any recommendations?
I came across some of these fullstackpython posts not too long ago, they're nicely done by the way (just noticed you have your whole site on github, too!). Bokeh is great. Have you ever tried creating a hover tool with two y range axes?
This is really creative!
WOW, I will try looking into that...... i used to have an autohotkey script that did this ,,, i am self taught python so this might be really complicated if anybody wants to just paste the code, otherwise i will paste the code. (i updated the main code )
I was interested in bokeh a few years ago, then I learned JavaScript and D3, and realized they were trying to reproduce D3 in Python. D3 is easier.
As a mechanical engineer that uses python a lot this is good for learning. But also learn numpy and scipy 
sick!
Ok, thanks! Will check those out.
You might be able to write a script to scroll down the page taking screenshots. Then you could stitch them together. It's a lot of work but would give you what you want.

Vigil is a very safe programming language, and an entry in the January 2013 PLT Games competition. Many programming languages claim to take testing, contracts and safety seriously, but only Vigil is truly vigilant about not allowing code that fails to pass programmatic specifications. Syntax and semantics Vigil is very similar to Python with the minor proviso that you must provide a main() function which will be automatically called for you. Infinitely more important than mere syntax and semantics are its addition of supreme moral vigilance. This is similar to contracts, but less legal and more medieval. Runtime vigilance This is where Vigil sets itself apart from weaker languages that lack the courage of their convictions. When a Vigil program is executed, Vigil itself will monitor all oaths (implorations and swears) that have been made. If an oath is broken, the offending function [ python 3 print without newline ]( python 3 print without newline ) (the caller in the case of implore and the callee in the case of swear) will be duly punished. How? Simple: it will be deleted from your source code. The only way to ensure your program meets its requirements is to absolutely forbid code that fails to do so. With Vigil, this shall be done for you automatically. After enough runs, Vigil promises that all remaining code meets its oaths.
You can also do this using CEF Python library, I've added tutorial here on reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/670t3l/take_a_screenshot_of_a_web_page_using_cef_python/ Note that this technique of setting big viewport is not always reliable, it will fail miserably on some websites, and that includes Selenium as well. The 100% reliable method would be to use javascript to scroll web page and take screenshots during each scroll and then merge all images.

Pandas is by far the best package I've seen for working with data like this. You can read a dataframe from a CSV and choose what values pandas should place for empty values (e.g., zero, np.nan, etc). I'm on mobile, so too lazy to link, but just Google "pandas from_csv). Your resulting code will look something like ``` import pandas as pd data_df = pd.from_csv(path) ```

Just so everybody knows, Bokeh has gone through a lot of changes. A lot of things have been removed/deprecated/or moved out. So the documentation is nightmarish. For example charts have been totally removed, so if you want to make a bar chart, you have to use holoviews. Lot's of old examples just don't work anymore. It's an awesome package, and I have been using it lately, but it's far from polished, and documentation and clarity of use is a weakness, particularly when it comes to the whole bokeh server thing.

People frequently misunderstand the Zen of Python. It does *not* say "Only One Way To Do It" (despite what a lot of Perl people used to say about Python). It says: There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it. The emphasis should be on the *obvious* not the one. There should be an obvious way to solve the problem. Its okay if there are a million ways to solve the problem, so long as there is *at least* one **obvious** way to solve it. (Preferably only one such obvious way, but that's not compulsory.) 
Thank you for sharing your insights. :) Nonetheless, pythonic for me means that there’s a common denominator for how things are done and people should think twice before going a different route. Always remember “simple is better than complex”. A solution using decorators is (at least in this case) more complex than a solution without.

An interesting claim, given that Boyer-Moore isn't a regexp algorithm. I haven't looked at the code, but I'm assuming you're either scanning the search string for special characters or taking an explicit parameter to see if you need to do a plain text search rather than a regexp search, and then using Boyer-Moore if you're doing a plain text search. And what, a home brewed NFA for regexp searches?
/r/learnpython is the right sub for this. &gt; How do I fix this? It is not clear what "this" is. Explain and you might get some help. Also, format your code or use something like pastebin.com. It is unreadable and makes it difficult to debug/diagnose and help you.

https://pastebin.com/FpN1btpz So, when the user is asked if they want to partake in the questionnaire, rather than typing Yes or No (which is what is in the code) you can just type a random word or letter and it will just go onto the next lines which would be the age question. Is there a way I can stop this so it goes back to the top?
That is because of the indentation. The age line should belong inside the `elif` part of the program. Currently, it is outside the if block. So, the age question doesn't care what the answer is to the above questions. 
Pretty nice and detailed guide. Just note, though, that using Pusher introduces the service as a third-party dependency, meaning that you don't have full control over it and might want to avoid it if you're dealing with sensitive or confidential data.
Perhaps you might want to ask a specific question. __all__ isn't necessary, it's mostly just a way of keeping a clean module, to export only a few symbols.

You can use whatever you want really. I think it's good if you use the command line to run scripts, so that you know what's going on. Sublime is fine, atom, notepad, python idle etc. You don't need anything extreme like pycharm to learn python.
From what I see neither in root of requests or click libraries does not contain ____init____.py but the sub-packages does. Why is this? AFAIK there should be an ____init___.py inside the root that pulls all the sub packages, in order to do something like this: from request import sub-package if not, the imports is: from requests.requests import sub-package Am I right?
The root of the requests package does have `__init__.py` ([here](https://github.com/requests/requests/blob/master/requests/__init__.py)). You might be confused because the package is not the top level of the Github repository. Normally the package is a directory within the Git repository, and the top level contains packaging information (`setup.py`), configuration for testing tools (`.travis.yml`), and other directories for things like docs.

Some constructive criticism: Lines too long, and probably too many comments! I know you've been told to comment your code - and that is a good thing, but you shouldn't write comments that explain what obvious code does. Where the operation isn't obvious, or complex enough that you might need to explain it to your future self, put the comment *before* the code. Also reduce it down to "headline" style language - just say what happens, for example: #we firstly timestamp the operation, but we store the timestamp as a string (just chopping off the decimals as we don't need it down to the last nanosecond) Goes to: # timestamp the operation (strip off nanoseconds) For big block comments, particularly at the top of the module, or top of a function, use docstrings like this: def get_node_data(node): """ this function interrogates node for information and logs it as values in a string in order to then compile a list of results for the whole subnet """ node_data=[] # timestamp the operation (strip off nanoseconds) node_data.append(str(int(time.time())) # we add the IP that we're pinging to the result list node_data.append(node) Finally, it helps to break your code up vertically into distinct sections, so your eye naturally picks out the extent of each section. But don't go mad - only do this as much as makes sense/makes it easier to read.

I've just been using multiprocessor and mapreduce. I'm able to parse 10gb Apache access logs in under a min. 20 lines of code.
Your example doesn't use heat maps in any way. What you're describing is a type of interactive visualization that's far outside the scope of most Python libraries; you'd almost certainly be doing a great deal of hand-coding new functionality into any toolkit you might choose to try to achieve this. For instance, you could try to leverage a toolkit like MayaVI or something else built on VTK, but you're probably going to be doing a lot of low-level implementation so why not just go to the VTK layer directly? Most importantly, it's not clear that what you're describing is the best way to present this sort of information. It seems like it would be much easier to parse and understand in a table where each component was clearly identified and all the metadata you needed was there.
Still need to indent another two spaces. Indentation changes the meaning of Python programs, so it’s kind of important. The else clause could belong to the if statement or the while loop, depending on how it is indented. I believe you want it to be connected to the if statement and indented so it is the same level as if and Elif. While loops can contain an else clause, but it isn’t necessary or particularly useful.
The itertools function requires the input to be sorted by the result of the key function already in order to give the same result
python-for-android has a pygame bootstrap, but it's old, deprecated, and possibly has hacks that would interfere with normal pygame use.
Thanks for clarification
Now I know, thanks !
My bot is still working with PhantomJS https://gitlab.com/kenzietandun/lltwitter/blob/master/lltwitter.py#L270
Please sort the code out, and while you're at it get rid of the unneeded brackets, e.g. if len(textnums) != 3: while det &gt;= 0.0 : is all you need.
I'd be interested in seeing this. Is you code posted online somewhere?
well the heat map would be for overlaying a bunch of the same data on top of say the same data. Maybe not a map but something to the effect of “we installed 5 lug nuts, average time on the top lug nut tool 10 seconds but the other 4 took 20 seconds a piece.” As for the best way of displaying it, we want a quick way of seeing a good or bad install over the course of time. 
Sure np. Baby is about to take morning nap. Need about an hour and I'll give ya a link to the GitHub.
Reddit is not a good place for support, I recommend the IRC chatroom myself.
I recommend PyCharm as an IDE. In terms of learning, start with understanding the basic syntax, classes, and comprehensions, then go from there.
all noted, thank you
If you indent an entire thing of code by four spaces on reddit, it'll show up with monospace formatting: #!/usr/bin/python27 import sys, math def calculate_roots(a,b,c): start = "The coefficients %f, %f, and %f have" % (a, b, c) det = (b ** 2) - (4 * a * c) def r(a, b, det, sign): return (-b + (sign * (math.sqrt(det)) / (2 * a) if det &gt; 0: r1, r2 = r(a, b, det, 1), r(a, b, det, -1) return "%s have 2 real roots: %f &amp; %f" % (start, r1, r2) elif det == 0: r1 = -b / (2 * a) return "%s have 1 real root: %f" % (start, r1) else: return "%s no real roots" % (start) cont = True while cont: line = raw_input("Input a b c: ") z = line.split(" ") if len(z) != 3: cont = False try: a, b, c = float(z[0]), float(z[1]), float(z[2]) except ValueError: print "Error: Not all inputs are numbers." cont = False else: print calculate_roots(a, b, c) The way you typed yours, multiple lines merged into one.
I tried but it didn´t worked flawsless. What worked as expected was using nbconvert to html, cleaning some html elements, as &lt;html&gt; itself, and pasting as raw html. You can add hooks to wagtail editor, adding new features to it. Wagtail uses halo.js editor. You can google 'halo editor wagtail hooks' and you´ll find more information. I stopped working hard on it as I´m using puput and I´m waiting for them to update to streamblocks, which are awesome and work really well for injecting jupyter notebooks in the way above mentioned.
Thanks! I´ll wait for the reasons above mentioned. If it still does not work as expected, I´ll try it.

vispy is not under much active development anymore. PyQt can do absolutely everything one could imagine, its problem is documentation. Most documentation is for PyQt4 or for C++. Try Googling PyQt + QGraphicsItem, I hope it works for you. 
I've started Python with only an editor and the Interpreter. I know some friends who have used a debugger, however I can learn better when I have to search the error myself. Obviously this doesn't work on huge project but as a beginner you don't work on them anyway.
How does this compare to ripgrep or the_silver_searcher?

Yeah, pretty much. It identifies longest fixed substrings in a regex and uses it to anchor the match with BM, before running the full regexp search. So if you search for "abcd*ef", it will start by using BM to search for "abc".
Ty, Enrolled!
yeah, I've not thought much about that. It would be a good idea though. I just haven't thought of a good meaningful benchmark to use. For example, I used to have something that shows the diff. between searching a 1GB text file for a "pathological" backtracking expression, e.g. "e*riknyquist" using python re library (takes 15-20 secs), and then the same using rxvm (takes about 500 ms). But that seemed not very meaningful to me. Open to suggestions!
It says $195 on my end. 
You probably wouldn't. Regex indeed is probably more solid, given that a bunch of people seem to use it already..... but if for some reason you need a non-backtracking parser and you could make do with fewer bells and whistles (e.g. no backrefs, no sub-matches) then you might try rxvm. 
So, I just tried generating a ~10GB plain text file with "cat /dev/urandom | base64 | head -c 10000000000 &gt; file", and I appended my name "eriknyquist" onto the end. Then, I searched this file for the expression "(e*[rR])+iknyquist" using the 7-line python rxvm example that can be seen here https://github.com/eriknyquist/librxvm/tree/master/pyrxvm#quick-example 6 seconds to search the whole file.

I don't understand your pricing strategy. You have 1 hour of content with 23 minutes of it dedicated to setting up python for 120 dollars? There are much more indepth course with 40+ hours of content, more topics explored, more exercises, etc... for the same amount if not just a little more also on udemy. I honestly just don't see where the value is. 
I was thinking of PyGraphQT, but PyQT itself might be a good idea, too. Can someone explain how QT works for open source projects?
I don't know many people who use discord for programming. The ecosystem is generally on slack (which discord is cloned from), and the old boys (c, asm, etc) hang out on irc. 
Is the bottleneck the downloading or the actual processing? If former, you could use asyncio or similar to download in parallel. If the latter, you could use multiprocessing module and create thread pools to process in parallel. Of course, if you are on a single CPU DO instance and already maxing out CPU, then would need to spin up multiple instances and distribute work across instances.
Actually the bottleneck is the classification algorithm. Downloading is pretty fast. But since it is only one cpu I see cpu spikes and also memory spikes. But I think it is not possible to classify two images in parallel- on that machine. Not sure if it would be faster to go to batches like download 100images and classify 100
Take a look at [this](ivre.rocks) project, you might find it useful to improve your solution!
that's really cool!... i'll deffinetly check it out
Agreed. But then again nobody will actually pay 120$. I don’t think anybody would pay more than 20$ per course on Udemy, since they are so often on discount (120$ to $10, 150$ to 25$) I think the reason it shows as 120 is the Udemy pricing model.
Neat. Was your host an AWS m3.small? What's your memory usage look like?

Too late :(
(This ended up far longer than I intended but since I've written it now, I'll post it. It's up to you if you ignore it) I have no knowledge of making RC planes or gcode but this looks like a good project. Things like the logo (did you draw it?) and well written docs make a world of difference to first impressions of people looking at the project. And since you asked for feedback and comments on the content are often more useful than platitudes... One suggestion I'd make is to add the package to pypi so that you can add a third `pip install hotwing` method of installing it to the source and binary versions. I'd also suggest looking into virtual environments for people installing from source. On unix systems, installing system wide packages is generally not recommended (not a terrible thing but worth thinking about) because python is used for some system operations. If you want other feedback/things to add (please don''t take these as criticisms - the project looks good, this is just where I'd take it from here): * add a way to generate the config file. Copying and pasting the file works but means leaving the program and coming back and breaks up the flow. Having a command (something like `hotwing init myconfig.cfg` to create the config file would be very useful. It could just paste the default as it is or you could use something like [cookiecutter](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/cookiecutter/1.5.1) to customise it interactively - I'm not sure how well it would translate to designing wings. * I know there is a definite advantage to using standard libraries over third party alternatives so bear in mind this is entirely subjective (and many people on this subreddit are going to disagree with it) but I'd look into using something like [click](http://click.pocoo.org/5/) instead of argparse. It removes a lot of the validation code you need for things like `if not os.path.isfile(CONFIG_FILE)` and converting inputs to floats/files etc. It can also do cool stuff like make autocompletion work on the command line and adding colour and file redirection. * Have a look at the [logging]() module to replace the `if DEBUG: print(...)` blocks. It make it much easier to change what you see when running the code. I wish I'd known about it when I started out. Also see the articles [here](https://dev.to/grhegde09/logging-done-right-makes-your-life-bright) and [here](http://vasir.net/blog/development/how-logging-made-me-a-better-developer). * Add a [shebang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)) to the top of your file so that unix users can run it without calling python directly (ie `$ hotwing-cli config` instead of `$ python hotwing-cli config`) Minor code review type stuff - feel free to ignore * In your `main.py` module you have a load of lines like from hotwing_core.profile import Profile Because you already have the imports in the `__init__.py` file of `hotwing_core`, these can be replaced with from hotwing_core import Profile * I'd break the main function up a bit. It's long and alternates between validation/checks/converting arguments and actually doing to work. * You have a fair amount of repeated code. Bits like the [`get_config`](https://github.com/jasonhamilton/hotwing-cli/blob/master/hotwing_cli/main.py#L104-L123) method could use the fact that `str` and `float` are callable and be condensed to opt = CONFIG_OPTIONS[section][parameter] try: return opt['type'](Config.get(section, parameter)) except ConfigParser.NoOptionError: if opt['required']: raise else: if DEBUG: print("using default for %s - %s"%(section,parameter) ) return opt["default"] # you might also add an except block to cleanly handle the case where # the user has entered invalid text (eg `abc` for a float field) Also look at what sections of the two `Rib` constructions are common and pull them out. Maybe add a `from_config` class method to Rib. Finally I'd just like to repeat how great it is to read through a project that has good documentation and examples. It makes it so much nicer to read through and appealing to users.

Yes, for me too 😢 Any way to upp it somewhere? 
* remove one indent of except, if, else * add colon after 'if number is 2' so the correct code is: number = input("What is 1+1?\n") number = 0 while True: try: number = int(input("What is 1+1?: \n")) except ValueError: print("That's not a number!\n") continue if number is 2: print("That's right!") else: print("Are you dumb?!")

This is amazing. Thank you!
I dont really get what you mean when you say “remove one indent of expect, if, else” , but i added the colon
Python indent equals to 4 spaces, on line 7 there are 8 spaces, remove 4. the same goes for the following lines: on line 10 and 12 there are 8 spaces, make them 4. and on line 8,9,11, and 13 there are 12 spaces, you need to make them 8. 
No, it was on my 3-ish yrs old Intel i5 laptop. Files are handled 8k at a time, and the memory usage for the actual regexp matching is determined by the expression, not the input. So the memory usage is the same whether you're searching through a 1GB file or a 10GB file. I don't have the actual numbers offhand (i.e. how much memory is used in total for that test I posted above), but hang around for a bit and I can post them
What version of python?
Thanks, Discord getting really popular btw. 
He's new to python, he can't figure out how to install matplotlib, and he keeps getting an unsupported wheel error. Is it really that difficult?
The amount of memory allocated to hold the compiled expression "(e*[rR])+iknyquist" is 372 bytes. The amount of additional memory allocated whenever you want to match that expression against some text (no matter the input size) will be 150 bytes. This second number would only go up if you had longer/more complicated expressions. 
Just install anaconda 
The easiest way I know, is to just install Anaconda. 
Would have loved to try this course!

Yes but Slack has become an industry standard for a lot of companies. It also ties in well with various tools such as CI.

&gt;For example, { AND circuit, AND gate } is a synset that represent a logical gate that fires only when all of its inputs fire. Did this guy purposely choose the most obscure example he could think of
I know, but the assignment is just the benefits and drawbacks of using it (in context against a list if needed?) I don't know anything about them and couldn't find anything online, so any help would be appreciated.
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2831212/python-sets-vs-lists Ultimately, the answer is it depends on what you're doing.
I just started programming. I've been working on a script to practice lists. It basically randomly chooses one of four pokemon and they fight until each one has fought an equal number of times. They've fought a 1,000,000,000 battles at this point. I made a post about it because I'm not sure what's going on.

Durnit, I should really subscript to this sub. 6 hours late 
It shouldn't be. That's why people just use Anaconda. It comes packaged with all that stuff. Otherwise, `pip install wheel` first.
this particular example is borrowed from the assignment problem description, why this is obscure anyway? since AND gate "IsA" logic gate, i think it's an easy one to understand synset-hypernym with an analogy to specialization-generalization in OO concepts, is it not?
It really depends on what you're doing, but there's a few notes about sets that set them apart from lists: * Sets are mutable; their contents can be changed at runtime. * Sets work according to the rules of [set theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_theory). That is to say that they have no inherent order to their elements and cannot contain repeat elements. (eg. {A,B,C,D} is a set, but {A,B,B,C} is not) * You cannot create sets from mutable types like lists, or other sets; if you want to create a set from another set, the source set must be a frozenset. You **can**, however, use a tuple to create a set. * Sets add special meaning to certain operators. For example, 'x &amp; y' creates the set representing the intersection (common elements) between the sets x and y. If you don't care about order and don't want any repeat elements, sets are good at getting the job done. If, however, you need something that can handle repeat elements, can be used to create n-dimensional arrays, then you want a list. Again, this isn't a complete set of pros and cons; likely, it barely scratches the surface, but it should suffice to at least get you started.
**Set theory** Set theory is a branch of mathematical logic that studies sets, which informally are collections of objects. Although any type of object can be collected into a set, set theory is applied most often to objects that are relevant to mathematics. The language of set theory can be used in the definitions of nearly all mathematical objects. The modern study of set theory was initiated by Georg Cantor and Richard Dedekind in the 1870s. *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Python/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.27
You're using `random` but expect the results not to be? While it's true that over a large enough number of repetition, the number of battles fought would average to the same, there is no guarantee for a single run. If you want to increase your chances, you'll have to drop the randomness (or guide it a bit). For example you could pick a random Pokemon except the one that has fought the most battles so far.
I'd suggest Coursera, and Edx.. pretty sure there are other resources but not that I know of
Wow. Thank you for the in-depth review and feedback! I will definitely implement these changes. The logo I had designed by someone I found on Fiverr.com. As for Virtualenv I was trying to make the directions as simple as possible but I always use separate environments. I wonder if adding the additional step will trip up users. I really like the idea of the config file init command. Makes total sense. All these years I've been coercing integer division and there's a simple import statement to fix this. Oh man how much time I could have saved myself if I would have known this earlier.... Thanks again! 
&gt; While it's true that over a large enough number of repetition, the number of battles fought would average to the same Actually, even that's not true. OP has a multinomial distribution with each p_i = 1/4. While the expected value is equal to n/4 for each X_i, the variance grows with the number of trials as 3*n/16, so it becomes more and more unlikely that the values will ever be equal.
Yeah, that does make sense. I'll try to limit the randomness in some way. Thank you your advice!
Nothing wrong with the code, this it just straight statistics. There's just nothing in your math that would force the numbers to converge. Let's say I flip a coin 10 times, and get 5 heads. What are the odds of flipping another coin 10 times, and also getting 5 heads? It's only about 25%. (See the Binomial Distrubition for the math). In your case, every time one score pulls ahead, the other 3 scores have to also pull ahead to converge. But since all 4 scores have an equal chance to increase, it's more likely that the first score will increase again before all of the other three have a chance to move up.
Why didn't you pay attention in class?
Why didn't you try google?
This is extremely basic math and programming. If you can't do this then you clearly aren't paying attention in class (you aren't fooling anyone this is obviously some kind of homework)

Okay, I just love this. This just ought to be perfect for discovering how to plot this specific figure you have in mind but don't know what it's called. Oh and don't get me started on the layout and navigation of the website... nice. Instant bookmark. Although I wish he would use and showcase matplotlib's object oriented API and not it's Matlab like interface. 
Of course not. Install it, and then you have a Python version with matplotlib pre-installed along with other rather useful libraries.
Thanks man didn't know that.
Hi, you're right, Udemy pricing is pretty nuts! A course is almost never sold at full price, so a good promo just means an discount to $10 instead of to $25. You're right also about the amount of video - the core video content is less than an hour, and it is more focussed than other courses. But unlike other courses, you'll spend hours practising with the exercises, which are provided as Jupyter Notebooks. Making the exercises (and finding the right datasets to illustrate concepts) really took *ages*, and I hope that having good exercises written for you will mean you learn more effectively. Looking at my landing page, though, I could articulate that better.
Yeah, this is an excellent project to learn with. I would probably do this with selenium to browse the website and openpyxl to update the spreadsheet.
Bookmarked!
Hey! The link for bad chart is... bad! It links to the icon URL instead of a page.
Thanks man doing that
Thanks man. Using sublime.
Not using a debugger myself :D
Oh I mean I installed it. Does it replace Pycharm? 
This is great.
In terms of programming skills or mathematics?
/r/learnpython is a better place for questions like this. If it wasn't clear in others responses, indentation depth matters in python.
Wow, a huge thumb up. ``python-chart-gallery.com``, I'm gonna memorize that.
In the past, I did flask, fronted by gunicorn fronted by nginx. Like this article. https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-serve-flask-applications-with-gunicorn-and-nginx-on-ubuntu-14-04 With nginx, I could fire up multiple gunicorn processes on different cpus, and have nginx proxy ports 80/443 to the different gunicorn server ports. Each gunicorn instance listened on a different port. It was overkill, probably, but it worked well. 
You are correct in thinking that the advice of putting nginx in front of any WSGI servers has become more folklore than based on first hand experience of the people who are stating this. Reality is that although in some cases putting nginx in front of a WSGI server does provide benefits, it isn't always necessary. For a start Apache/mod_wsgi works quite happily without needing nginx in front of it, just so long as you don't screw up the Apache configuration. Unfortunately, if setting up Apache yourself the default Apache configuration is not very well suited for hosting Python web applications. The default is more appropriate for PHP and static file handling. So you do need to pay some attention to how you are setting it up and not just accept defaults. Using mod_wsgi-express avoids the problems with defaults as it uses a generated configuration which is tailored to using Apache for Python web applications. Either way, you still need to tune any WSGI server to the needs of your specific WSGI application. As to whether other WSGI servers need to have nginx in front really depends on what your application is doing. For the majority of WSGI applications out there, the volume of traffic is low enough that using nginx in front doesn't really make much difference. If using a hosted platform for your WSGI application, often they have a routing layer in front of your application which acts to help isolate your WSGI application from the Internet, and provide a measure of buffering for request and response anyway, which is the benefit that nginx is in part is argued to provide you. One opinion which definitely seems to prevail out there is that using nginx in front of any WSGI application will somehow make the WSGI application somehow magically faster. That is complete nonsense. For the typical WSGI application the bottleneck is still going to be your application code and call outs to backend services. So although nginx may help in certain cases, you are much better off spending your time implementing some form of performance monitoring for your application. Do this well and it will help you to identify the real bottlenecks and help you make your application better. This will provide you greater long term gains than putting nginx in front of the WSGI server you use.
Neat, thanks!

Think 'advantages and disadvantages', 'pros &amp; cons', compared to other data structures. How quickly does a 'set' implementation perform the basic operations of adding, deleting, finding an element? traversing the collection? When would you use a set and not a list, or a heap? When would you prefer lists to sets?
[matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
The comment has been deleted, could you share the link as well?
Minor typo at the end: "except ‘z’ is only evaluated once." should be "except ‘y’ is only evaluated once."
Indeed. This is probably a 'quick hitter' for needs vs when you really need something more robust. And Matplotlib, especially the non pyplot side (the OOP side) is like swinging a sledgehammer at times. I found the Docs on the Matplotlib to be pretty helpful. http://matplotlib.org/gallery/index.html#api-examples But even more helpful, if you have a SafariOnlineBooks sub (I prefer online vs the O'Reilly books -- not color and layout needs improvement IMO) but Jake VanderPlas' "Python Data Science Handbook" (Ch 4) has a great run throw Data Viz, especially the OOP side of Matplotlib. https://www.amazon.com/Python-Data-Science-Handbook-Essential/dp/1491912057
this is an excellent cheatsheet, esp for the ones i don't use so often. bravo!
Maybe [Dask](https://dask.pydata.org/en/latest/index.html)?
good paper
I use gevent-fastcgi and uWSGI backends with nginx. Nginx for production is highly recommended for python environments. 
Theano? Or Dask indeed.
Sure, it was just a link to the [d3 example library. ](https://github.com/d3/d3/wiki/Gallery)
The main 4 libraries used for the plots seem to be Matplotlib, Seaborn, Pandas, and Numpy. All 4 libraries are supported on Python 2.7 and 3+. 
By who and why?
Just that Sublime costs $80.
I've started using the highly-recommended Python Crash Course now, which seems great.
No enums? def press(btn): if btn=="info": print(app.infoBox("INFO", "This is the info box")) elif btn=="error": print(app.errorBox("ERROR", "this is the error box")) elif btn=="warn": print(app.warningBox("WARNING", "This is the warning box")) Is this what happens when you cripple your code in order to support Python 2?
Right
Because NGINX handels static files bettet/faster

What is this line for when self.value is already a hexadecimal string? hex(int(self.value, base=16))
Do you mean dependency graphs? Or do you mean graph theory? My colleague and I did a search for the latter ourselves a year or so a go, couldn't find anything. In the end, we wrote our own Numpy+Cython routines for clique detection etc.
What if you replace method 'min' with 'dense'?
You're missing a closing `)` on the previous line.
There seems to be some confusion as to why it’s necessary to run a reverse proxy in front of the most popular WSGI servers (gunicorn and uwsgi). It doesn’t magically make your app faster. What it DOES do is protect you against [slow loris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slowloris_%28computer_security%29)-style attacks. Gunicorn and uwsgi are normally configured with a pool of workers. Because of Python’s GIL, each gunicorn or uwsgi worker can only handle one request at a time. If all your workers are busy, your server hangs. This can occur maliciously (someone is attempting to bring down your site) or accidentally (you have a bunch of slow endpoints). It’s likely to happen on a smaller scale in most web scenarios while your workers wait for data to arrive from a network connection. To protect yourself from that, you can use a a reverse proxy that fully buffers requests before sending them to your WSGI server. That way, your reverse proxy does all the waiting, and your workers only do work when there’s work to do. On the other hand, you don’t need a reverse proxy if you don’t have GIL’d WSGI workers or a non-buffering WSGI server. You could use [Waitress](http://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/waitress/en/latest/), a WSGI server that fully buffers requests (though it doesn’t support SSL) or Tornado or uwsgi asyncio nodes or even write your own web server using threads or asyncio. Ultimately, many people choose to use the most popular setup, which necessitates a buffering reverse proxy, hence the advice. 
**Slowloris (computer security)** Slowloris is a type of denial of service attack tool invented by Robert "RSnake" Hansen which allows a single machine to take down another machine's web server with minimal bandwidth and side effects on unrelated services and ports. Slowloris tries to keep many connections to the target web server open and hold them open as long as possible. It accomplishes this by opening connections to the target web server and sending a partial request. Periodically, it will send subsequent HTTP headers, adding to—but never completing—the request. *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Python/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.27

By the mystical "guys that know this stuff". This is in line with "don't write your own crypto" or "the authors of framework X are better at Y than you". They authors of crypto libraries or popular frameworks obviously seceded by _not_ following such silly baseless advice. Note how in a topic I started to try to, for once, discuss WSGI servers without the usual non-sense, most of the replies are already people stating that they run gunicorn or uWSGI behind nginx. It's like I am comiting heresy or something.
Nice idea, have you considered saving the colors in a pre-created dict so that the CSV doesn't need to be read each time/at all?
I specifically stated clearly that that is **not** my use case. It's literally the first thing I said after stating what I want to do. I don't mean to be sarcastic, I'm genuinely puzzled why would you reply to a topic where you outright ignore the first and more obvious thing I say? Is it trolling? Do you get a kick of echoing what some guy said somewhere? did you get confused? Was it not clear enough? I don't know how I cuold possibly make it more obvious than I did.
The Python Data Science Handbook is available online for free [here](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/).
DataFrames let you filter with a Series of True/False values. So you can combine those with logical operators. df[(df.third_col &gt;= 4) &amp; (df.third_col &lt;= 10)] Assuming “third_col” is the name of your third column and “df” is the name of the DataFrame. 
You installed it, so you have matplotlib. Type pthon myscript.py
The column has no names. I figured it out though!
Try /r/learnmachinelearning. Excepting those in Matlab/Octave, Java, or perhaps Lua, most content for beginning ML will be based around Python.
I recommend [Programming Collective Intelligence](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Collective-Intelligence-Building-Applications/dp/0596529325). You will learn to build machine learning algorithms from scratch. Sadly it does not follow the Python naming conventions. Another great book is [about scikit-learn](https://www.amazon.com/Mastering-Machine-Learning-scikit-learn-Hackeling/dp/1783988363) which is a widely used python lib for machine learning. It contains simple examples and practical knowledge.

There is no safe and unsafe. There is only the amount of risk you are willing to accept.
This is great work! Most times I'm searching for examples there either partially wrong or complicated. 
Why not use Anaconda?
We are going for a simpler system, one that doesn't wrap around virtualenvs. The difference in our package manager is that the python start-up is customized when viper is installed. So there is no need to create environments at all. It will just know which dependencies to use from the hash values.
I guess it technically does error checking since it will throw a ValueError if self.value is not a valid hex string.
&gt; If all your workers are busy, your server hangs Are you sure about that? I think the whole "GIL" thing is not applied when we're talking about separate processes. GIL blocks multiple threads, but not processes (as far as I know...). So I think where you have workers based on separate processes than I think the problem with GIL doesn't appear.
Very nice! Thanks for posting that.
 Anyways, We've already figured out how to solve this issue(read the github issue). We're only getting started is why we have less commits. We're wrapping around easy_install, so a lot of the problems are already solved. We're not going to need to build an environment management system like in conda at all since it does not need it. So far we've borrowed some code from pip and taken some of the inspiration from pipenv.
So it doesn't support vitualenv and it will only work for one project at a time? What about changing dependencies for a given project? 
So, instead of using a text editor that doesn't have all of the pycharm features out of the box, you're suggesting he uses a different text editor which also does not have all of pycharm features out of the box.
Haha just figured it out... I was too busy looking at the line mentioned in the error to spot it..
I'm sorry you've misunderstood me, I didn't meant to say you should use it behind a proxy. But most people are using wsgi for normal websites with static files and therefore it makes sense to use Nginx to serve the static files for security reasons. I understand your position but think it's pretty rare. I think i wouldn't use Nginx in your position either.
No, why wouldn't it support virtualenvs ? It's completely compatible with it because `Viper` doesn't even need to be aware of it. Change the dependencies in the `viper.json` file of the project. Understand ?
You name your colums with: mydf.columns = [my list of column names]
wait so if matplotlib is installed how come I still can't import it in my code?

Sets are O(1) for most operations. The makes a huge difference if you’re doing anything in a nested loop. They are also really great for seeing what’s in one and not another without any loops! Basically, they are hugely useful! If you use them correctly!
To understand why a reverse proxy is sometimes necessary you need to understand the different execution models of WSGI servers. Lets explore a couple of Gunicorn's worker types: **Sync** The synchronous worker can only handle one request at a time. This is nice from a simplicity standpoint, but it has some drawbacks. The main one being that a slow client can completely tie it up. This makes it trivial to DoS. A reverse proxy like nginx fixes this issue by buffering up slow requests, only sending them to the WSGI server when they're ready to be processed. **Async (gevent/eventlet)** Asynchronous workers can handle many simultaneous client connections without suffering from the slow client problem. It does this by [monkey patching](https://github.com/benoitc/gunicorn/blob/master/gunicorn/workers/ggevent.py#L57-L79) the standard library so that most blocking IO calls actually don't block anymore. Now, instead of blocking, it registers the IO call with an event loop behind the scenes and attempts to process the next ready client connection. This uses the same machinery that nginx uses internally (epoll/kqueue). All of the extra machinery and monkey patching in async workers adds some complexity. It's not a free lunch. It's still possible to block by the worker by calling a function that does a lot of CPU intensive work (which you should probably be offloading into the background using something like `beanstalkd`), or by blocking on IO that wasn't monkey patched. Waitress from the Pyramid folks is also a production-ready WSGI server that can be exposed on the internet. You can read about the [design here](https://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/waitress/en/latest/design.html). TLDR: understand how the WSGI process deals with IO -- that's the key to understanding what's safe to put on the internet. Also, you still may want nginx to serve static files more efficiently or terminate SSL.

Yes, just use an SQLite database, which conveniently comes batteries included with Python. [Tutorial](http://sebastianraschka.com/Articles/2014_sqlite_in_python_tutorial.html).
Finally some objective information. So I suppose gunicorn and uwsgi just assume that they suffer from that condition and just tell you to put nginx in front. But what about others? From the top of my head there are: bjoern, cherry.py, wsgiserver, gevent, fapws, tornado. Is any of these suited to expose to the internet? Do the people developing them say so? Are there any success stories with any of them? I'm more for lightweight options, but I don't think I would restrict myself to the very fastest ones.

Check out Puppeteer by Google. 
That works, thanks a ton!
Does Theano have the same general purpose capabilities as Dask? I've only ever worked with tensorflow and it isn't general enough.
I was looking for something like dask (just got that name now), is the tool he created found open source? It'd be very useful to me.
Are you suggesting a pickled object or just sorting all the values in code?
I am interested in this too. The problem is my career has been in web apps and APIs, large scale systems, etc. since I left school. In other word, my theory sucks. Like really sucks. Does anyone know a book or online course that starts at the basics(the more basic the better) again?
Very cool!
What do you mean by “naming conventions” ?
It does not follow Python recommendations and style guide [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) 
Well I’ll be completely honest. I’m almost brand new to coding. I’d like to learn alongside other people. :/
What do you want as fonctionnalities? Theano (and tensorflow) as almost all the numpy functionality. They have been developed with machine learning in mind but have a full graphe computation engine possibilities. What is missing for your purpose? 
CherryPy has long been reliable.

You’re using import hooks? How will you handle other import hooks? Afaik import hooks don’t compose at all...
It’s not like loading code is free... you’d have to benchmark that to see if it makes sense. 
Remember to backup your database so you don't mess up his business. I highly recommend that you read [this](https://www.backblaze.com/blog/the-3-2-1-backup-strategy/) and have a reliable backup strategy not founded on optimism ;)
&gt; Is there a toolkit that bundles up a macOS app out of some given Python code (and its dependencies) so that the user does not have to install Python? Yes
No we decided not use it since it would require code to be processed on each import. We decided to use a sitecustomize.py file that will be injected into python upon first install. Users can also use `viper bite python3.6 python2.7 python3.5.4` to manually inject into specific versions (similar to how pyenv global). Then when a python file is launched, our code will run and detect all dependencies required from the `viper.json` dynamically adding it to `sys.path`. If a cache is available it will use that. If a dependency is not found, it will download it to the `.viper` folder and added to `sys.path` again.
True, its not free indeed. I didn't make any tests on this either to confirm my previous statement, just considering that it's a list of value pairs I thought it might be faster to store colors in something like a dict (or more optimized way) in order to save time.
In the future, /r/learnpython is the correct place for these types of questions (please read the sidebar). Also: Avoid a picture of a computer screen at all costs. Copy and paste your code.
Sounds good to me. Just to check that I understood: you download libs to one dir for everything with one dir per lib-version combination? So that you never need to download one version of a lib more than once to the same machine?
also this one: https://www.amazon.com/Python-Machine-Learning-Sebastian-Raschka/dp/1783555130/ref=pd_bxgy_14_img_2?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=CZYJ85V2TQJ2438TRBBQ
I think the assignments sounds bogus. There aren’t any “benefits” and “drawbacks” of using sets compared to dicts or lists or whatever. Either you use the correct data structure or not. It’s like asking what the benefits and drawbacks are of a hammer compared to a saw. I’d just interpret the question as “when is is appropriate to use a set, list or dict?” It’s a bit bigger maybe but it’s a question that makes sense. 
Pro tip: *always* start with basic syntax when troubleshooting. Even after many years, basic syntax errors are probably 50% of my errrrors.
You should probably just update a database with the data and then export to excel if needed. But otherwise seems pretty straight forward. I’d use bs4 because I’m used to it mainly.

They do actually have one? What can it do? Last time I tried searching, I couldn't find anything official.
Yes that is the plan. Everything is hash based. So if a library is already available or supports another version it will just add it to `sys.path`. By default no library will ever be reused twice. Our future plan is that if global is enabled using `viper global`, it will download everything to it's global app data directory instead of the local `.viper` folder.

Presumably so that you can create a `Color` from a `str` (that seems to be the only way to create a `Color`—it might make sense to be able to have `.from_string` and `.from_int` methods and call one or the other based on the type of the `value` parameter).
Why develop yet another package manager, why not work with the existing teams to improve what all ready exists? What makes you think that your project is an improvement on the current system? How much of this has been discussed on the pypa mailing list? I could go on but I believe that my message is clear, this is yet another doomed to fail project.
Join anyway and learn in the experience. No matter level you can learn and always come with new I dears.
Your code editor actually highlighted the problem area for you as well.

Teaching course at North American University using 2 books: https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml https://github.com/rasbt/python-machine-learning-book-2nd-edition/
These are 2 top resources based on reviews, and the content is amazing. I take very practical approach.
HI, I have the same issue like u. Have you fixed this problem yet? 
This book is very good if you need to learn Python, Numpy, Pandas, and Matplotlib first.
Every system so far is based on wrappers around virtualenv which makes the architecture of the package managers very different what we use in ours. The closest thing that comes to what we are developing is `pip` itself. One thing I like about the codebase of `pip` is it's very easy to read. But pip uses Optparse(for their own reasons) which will soon be depreciated and it isn't looking like they are about to start using argparse soon. We haven't had talks with `pypa` yet about this, but we did bring this forward to the #python irc channel where certain users raised some very good points. You can see my frustrations displayed on the gitter archives [here](https://gitter.im/viper-python/Lobby/archives/2017/10/09) This wasn't my idea to begin with and the intial idea was completely different from what we have right now([check this out](https://www.devrant.io/collabs/888205/viper-a-modern-packaging-tool-for-python)). I could technically drop this project anytime I want since this I haven't really put a lot of my time towards it. But I would the moment I feel this project isn't worth continuing. But for now I do feel it's worth something. All of this extra virtualenv mumbo jumbo is so unnecessary. Building complicated hacks around a problem that will to come back and bite you in a few years is not the way to go. A lot of the attitude in the python community is like this(just my personal opinion). Let's build more are more abstractions until we can't dig ourselves out any more. Atleast `viper` gives people options if nothing else.
I liked more some of explanations in the chapters on classification and regression from Aurélien Géron's book, but this book is also generally very good. Sebastian tends to show some concepts by implementing them from "scratch". 
Actually, this is not really good way to use database directly. There are a lot of different ORM ehich can reduce your code and allows to use differrnt databases in different environments for your application. So, take a look on SqlAlchemy this is really heavy ORM engine, but you can do almost anything you want with queries. Basicaly you just need to setup connection and create models, that's it. 
I am aware of all that although it doesn't answer my questions. But rather slips into the rhetoric of "you have to put nginx in front of it". I have used eventlet many times and others such as gevent and twisted a few times as well as the standard multiprocessing and threading modules. Supposedly we are not considering toy servers or development servers like flask's as a viable option to start with. We are already assuming they have the basic ability to serve at least a reasonable amount of requests.
Not yet. Get back to you when i find one. Cheers man.
I use nginx because I can get https for cheap. I can also use it as a doorman to a dozen services all running on localhost on different ports and just have nginx route them correctly.
Sure. Then what exactly is that risk? Isn't be aware of the risks what's important then? Taking the amount of risk from what others say without knowing the details sounds like the perfect recipe for disaster. We see all these servers saying to put nginx in front but they don't walk us through why exactly that is necessary. So far, /u/whereswalden90 was the only one pointing out a plausible valid reason not to expose a server to the internet. Yet I haven't seen a single page that mentions this in their webpage.
One of the bigger benefits you don't touch on is that nginx can serve as an inexpensive load balancer. If you find that only wsgi server isn't cutting it (and you've either determined that your app can't be optimized or optimizing isn't worth it), you can simply tell nginx to proxy to multiple wsgi servers. By exposing just the wsgi server, you create more work for yourself when you need this. 
So far, it's the only one I could find that assumes that. Here's a cherry.py contirbutor saying so: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3436202/cherrypy-do-i-really-need-to-put-it-behind-a-frontend/3441801 Althuogh another stackoverflow question mentions some SSL problem which I haven't had the time to read about in more detail: http://recollection.saaj.me/article/cherrypy-questions-testing-ssl-and-docker.html#ssl wsgiserver claims to be "production ready", but that is quite vague.
&gt; I understand your position but think it's pretty rare. This is confusing. Why is it rare? Isn't it the case of any public web api out there? But yeah, probably the starting point on any web server discussion would be precisely to define what that means. How much traffic is thrown at static assets and how much at a tiny computer program, aka dynamic content.
Well the best of luck to you but as I've never needed any help with packaging I'll leave it up to you. Of course 40 years in engineering and computing does mean that I RTFM before squealing on stackoverflow, reddit, quora or whatever that I can't do something, when the question has all ready been asked and answered a trillion times. Are beginners really incapable of using a search engine? &gt; But pip uses Optparse(for their own reasons) which will soon be depreciated It has been **deprecated** since 3.2 but I'm not aware of any indication as to when it will be removed. Maybe Python 4?
I need to do digital logic operations and have giant wierd nets in wierd shapes doing tiny operations at each activation point
I've been using composer and yarn and I like them over pip... they are more simple and clear
There are two types of python naming conventions, pep8 and wrong.
The reasoning that my partner on this project gave me was that this way we can compete with package managers like `npm`. You'd be surprised by how much you have to hold their hands sometimes. We as more "experienced" python programmers have been so accustom to dealing with this issue that it becomes second nature for us to use a virtualenv. I can remember giving a presentation a month back to some of friends on installing one of my projects so they could start pushing code and not one person had used a virtualenv before. I can assure they still haven't pushed any code. And I just checked, I guess optparse is deprecated after all. You can be f*ing sure that when even pip is using optparse, it's time for a change. Anyways, thanks for well wishes.
Finally somebody understands lol

When I'm given the error traceback, I always look at the line above first, before the given line. A good habit to pick up.
It's **PYTHON** :-) Start with the [requests package](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/).
hex() returns a string though.
The limitations are less around scale—AWS can provide larger instances. The limitations are around the libraries you can use. Pure Python? Go for it! Need a C library that isn’t in the default install? Probably won’t happen without some manual compilation. numpy and scipy are two obvious libraries that may have problems running. Regarding scale, look into caching via CloudFront or serving static pages from S3. I try to avoid going to the server when possible (e.g. for static, user-independent, content). 
Does it work in reverse? That would be very useful.

The problem is that each worker has a GIL. If you have 10 workers and I throw 10 slow requests at you, you can’t serve any new requests. 
Thanks, this helps alot
Having different modules loaded depending on what directory I am in sounds really unintuitive.
So you're complaining it's too easy ? But when `npm` does it, everyone is okay with it ?
No, I don't. You said it didn't wrap around virtualenv implying it doesn't work with that. You're using json which is supposed to be easy (new users don't know json; shoot I don't and I've been using python for 11 years) , but pip already has a requirements.txt file with a simpler format. Why not use that? You mentioned in another post that new users find python complicated. They have trouble closing parentheses, think brackets and parentheses are the same thing, don't even know what pip is or how to use it or what packaged to use. Helping beginners is a long road, especially when they don't want to do packaging. So now you're adding a json script on top of that. A new user will never write a requirements file. They want a gui with a description of each package. Anaconda has all that. It will even give you the MKL versions of certain hard to build libraries, so it's 10x faster. Users can upload their package to a central server, so conda can find it. It can build libraries that pip bombs on. It's really good.
I don't know what you did or what your environment looks like or if you even installed the right thing. You gotta be more helpful. I don't even know if you're on Windows or not...
Sorry if I wasn't clear, but the async Gunicorn workers and Waitress do not need to be behind nginx because they do not block on IO.
[The Geron book](https://www.amazon.com/Hands-Machine-Learning-Scikit-Learn-TensorFlow/dp/1491962291) is the best one out there. I just spent time going through them all and this is the best choice.
So tell me. Why isn't everyone using `conda` ? Why oh why ? For some reason or the other is the newer pipenv more popular ? Json is exactly a python dictionary according to beginners. But I have to admit I stuck to json because it meant one less dependency. As for the other thing, why would an older `.ini` file be better ? Please don't say TOML. Now the poor beginners have to learn one more syntax ? Had you noticed that the github issue also states that it can support a simple `.viper` file which would have been just an `.ini` format file ? It's not like we hadn't considered any of this stuff. We're not cutting out the pros so that beginners can a bit more comfortable. The pros can still use a `setup.py` file or an `.ini` file if they want. Lastly, what would make you think it won't work with a virtualenv ? Does `pip` wrap around virtualenv ? Please tell me why you think it work instead of just simply saying it won't. Thanks for the feedback btw :)

How? You try to address a specific problem, develop an overarching plan, and code it. You box yourself in, do a hopefully small redesign and move on. I've been running an open source project for 6 years. There are modules I've recoded 6 times because I couldn't do something, while keeping the API the same. It's 200k lines and while it has crusty bits, it's really good and reasonably popular. You just do it. I don't ask for help, but I get it and it's helpful. People occasionally complain and if they make a good point, I try to address it. I built a super important part to use dictionaries when I should have used numpy (which I wasn't comfortable with at the time), so I rewrote the thing and sped it up by 500x, while dropping memory usage by 5x. There are modules I want to have that I've attempted 3x that just turn out to be bad, so I scrap it for a year before another idea strikes me. Think I finally get how it should be, but you need to learn what the problems really are. Pip isn't broken and it's not hard to use if you read the docs, but there are things it doesn't do.
After working through this book would you say you would be comfortable implementing basic machine learning in a work place? Im working as an analyst and have been wanting to add basic ML to my toolkit 
lol i'd seen that comic before lol. made me chuckle.. i really wanted to collaborate with #pypa. But it's not like they are going to abandon pipenv just to start working on a better solution. That's what supporting viper would essentially mean. There's no way to integrate those features without starting from scratch. Considering Kenneth Rieitz is on that workgroup doesn't help either. They'd just vote to continue with pipenv. It's called bias. ^_^
Take a look at this: http://knowpapa.com/wb/ Not sure if it'll work in py 3x but worth a try.
You could try going through following recent books: * [Introduction to Machine Learning with Python](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920030515.do) * [Python Data Science Handbook](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920034919.do) * [Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920034919.do) though half of it deals specifically with Deep Learning &amp; Tensorflow
Not sure about the others, but Gevent and Tornado, being async, do not suffer from this problem AFAIK, and I believe Gunicorn and uwsgi can both be configured with asyncio and gevent workers. However, I'm not sure any of them cover SSL, which might be a showstopper for you unless you're terminating SSL somewhere else (a CDN, loadbalancer, etc.) (Please, for the love of ~~god~~ the internet, do not run your site without SSL) You might have some success looking at how people do Python web services on Heroku, since it's much harder to set up a reverse proxy on it than to just use a WSGI server. One additional problem you might run into if you use a relational database is running out of database connections. If you're processing a bunch of requests at the same time and each one needs a database connection, you run the risk of opening more connections than your database can handle. Connection pooling and max connection limits (though you **definitely should** use them) just shift the problem around, making it so you throw errors to your client rather than bringing down your database. You skip this problem entirely by fully buffering your requests, since then database connections are only open for as long as it takes to process a request. I only have direct experience with nginx/{gunicorn,uwsgi} setups, so I can't personally vouch for other setups. I've heard good things about Waitress, though the lack of SSL isn't a problem on Heroku (where I'm hosting my work). I would personally do a fair amount of testing/research before selecting any other options. Here's what I'd check: * Can you concurrently serve a number of long-running requests equal to 10x the number of workers? * What happens when you need one more request than your max connection limit allows? * What happens when you need one more connection than you have in your pool?

Probably, but I don't know what kind of analyst you are, so it's impossible for me to say really. 
Post over on r/learnpython and we'll help you out. Make sure you put down what you *have* figured out so far. You need to look up how to get keyboard input, how to print output, at least. 
What have you got so far? Python has libraries for just about all the things you have mentioned above, but you don't mention what you mean by "process it" (that could be anything, really).
Yeah ,I've found this before but this is basically what I've already made. What I need is something that actually interprets the HTML/CSS rather than just display the plain text of it.

How deeply invested in TKinter are you? I have used pywebkit in the past, and it works pretty well, but re-writing your project to use GTK might not be feasible or trivial.
My project is less than 200 lines. So not bad, but the idea was that no external libraries would needed and it was all using Python standard libraries.
No no no..you're missing the point. We're looking for collaborators. People interested in helping to build something like this. I was just posting this here trying to find people interesting in devoting their time to this. There's so much stuff to code in this project I can't even wrap my head around it(dbs, appdir management, wrappers, hashing, filemanagers, tests). Normally, I would box myself in. But there's only so much I can do alone and with the very little spare time I have(Plus this is just a side project of mine). I figured it would get done a lot faster if there are people who like the idea working on stuff simultaneously.
I'm definitely saving this thread for later...

Think about what kind of persistent data you need to handle. AWS Lambda will scale the processing aspect, but if you need to use a database (RDS) or some other form of persistence, how will that scale? And have you planned for the cost of that service?

It's not too easy. It's awkward and something I would have to constantly keep in mind while developing. Everyone is okay with Javascript taking 90 seconds to compile everytime they make a tiny change also. I am not very familiar with the Javascript workflow, but everytime I have used it we are building something and it makes sense to run the build command from the root directory. Doing datascience in python, I am not always running a command from the root project directory. In fact I rarely am. Do you never `pip install -e`? Do you never use the console scripts entry point? Im usually developing a module in one location and a use case for it in another or several locations. 
I've done a similar project, I might be able to put something together relatively quickly.
Moving to a using nginx as a load balancer isn't without work. First off, to load balance across multiple hosts you need to setup a new machine to run the load balancer. It is unlikely you would have had that to begin with if only running the one instance. When you do that, you have to contend with what you do about static file hosting. If that means you are now doing static file hosting on the load balancer host, then deployment becomes more complicated as you need to separately deploy the static files to that host. Instead of hosting static files yourself any more, you might decide to move them to a CDN, which means possibly tweaking your application as to how it handles caching. So moving to an architecture with a load balancer isn't necessarily like flicking a switch. Instead there a bunch of new issues you have to contend with. This is going to be the same whether you were using nginx previously in front of your WSGI server on the same host or not.

All valid points. At work we have a server dedicated to handling (most) static assets -- there are one or two applications that serve their own via Nginx inside the same docker container (which, unfortunately means scaling the app adds more Nginx instances that are unneeded). What I've been toying with is using maestro-ng to deploy docker containers to several hosts and two other containers to serve static assets, and then an NGINX container sitting in front of them to proxy to each (assets off of `/static` and APIs off of `/api`). I've only toyed around with this at home but it seems like a good enough solution to handle: 1. Only using as many nginx instances as necessary (three in this case) 2. Allow independent scaling of application (albeit on demand is a bit difficult with just Nginx and Docker; adding something like etcd might fix this, but the application I primarily work on doesn't deal with burst traffic) 3. Keeps frontend assets up to date without needing to push them to a CDN (which is overkill for this application). Conceivably bug fixes for frontend code could use a different deploy path than the backend code, but I've not experimented with that yet.
Although the Waitress server uses async i/o to manage the initial request as it arrives and buffers up request content, the way they have done it introduces new risks. Unless they have changed the implementation since I last looked, the way in which Waitress is implemented actually exposes it to memory usage attacks. IOW, fire off a a lot of parallel requests with a lot of request content but don't actually complete sending it all. Sure it will not exhaust client connections as things are still handled as async at that point, but if that request content gets buffered in memory then the attack can blow out memory usage which could then cause the application to fail or slow everything down if it starts swapping, as memory available on the host is exhausted. Now it does from memory have a timeout mechanism whereby if the connection is idle for some period it will close it and so throw out the connection, but usually these timeouts are way to large. A straight timeout on activity is easily defeated by sending a single byte every so often. If using Apache/mod_wsgi, your defence against the latter is the mod_ratelimit module of Apache. When using mod_wsgi-express this is set up automatically with some reasonable defaults. That module allows for detection of connections which have stalled, but also has the ability to terminate connections where the rate at which data is being sent through is too slow. Basic WSGI servers tend not to have such more sophisticated systems for dealing with such attacks. For Gunicorn async workers, you can also perform such memory attacks. All you need to do is identify a request handler which buffers the complete request in memory and just not send it all. The reason this is a problem with the async workers of Gunicorn is that the cap on the number of concurrent requests they handle is ridiculously high at 1000. So you can actually create a lot of concurrent requests and just flood it with request content. Using nginx in front doesn't always help as although it will buffer request content, it will not if request content buffering is turned off, or if the request content is over a certain size, in which case it will start streaming the content anyway, thus exposing the WSGI server behind to these sorts of memory usage attacks. These basic WSGI servers, although they can have a setting which allows a cap on the amount of request content, with a '413 Request Entity Too Large' response being automatically generated, the setting is way too large and is for any request. Take Tornado ASYNC server where streaming of request is not being done. In that case it also buffers up request content in memory, but it only has a singlet default setting on 100M per request for maximum request content size. So it too can be attacked in this way. Looking at Apache, it has not cap on request content size by default which can be taken advantage of. It does have

Hiya, kudos for giving this a go! I'm struggling to discover exactly why you're going it though - I'm not saying you don't have good reasons, I just can't see them enumerated clearly somewhere.

Not OP, but use pandas regularly and had a question. When starting out, I never used the dot syntax to access columns because I used "human readable" column names. Having discovered method chaining (and particularly the "assign" method), I now use valid Python variable names for columns (mainly to take advantage of ``assign()`` in method chaining, but the dot notation is nice). So, I guess I was wondering if there's a way to take advantage of assign and dot notation when your column names contain spaces, or if standard practice is to just rename them before displaying them (displaying them using, say, ``to_html`` on a website or ``to_excel``).

You could use key/value unpacking: df.assign(**{“my column name”: someData})
Does it use the file where you called python from? Or where the script is located?
You could use key/value unpacking: df.assign(**{“my column name”: someData})
To piggyback on /u/i_can_has_data, the technique there is called "masking," and masks can often get lengthy. I'm not sure if this is bad memory management, but I usually define a ``mask`` variable and then apply it, which I think also makes my code more legible. Something like ``mask = (df.third_column &gt; 3) &amp; (df.third_column &lt; 11)`` ``df = df[mask]`` Again, not sure if this is bad memory usage (since ``mask`` is a DataFrame of the same size as ``df``), but I think it makes the syntax more legible and makes it easy to keep lines under 79 chars.
Not sure if this is applicable to you (or if I understand your intent, tbh), but if I was doing something (in Python) on a webserver and required authentication, I'd just use Django.
Interesting! Never thought of this! Most of my column/index names are actually based on Django model instances, so I just define "name" (human readable) and "code" (Python variable form) to the Django models (if you're not familiar with Django, basically just properties of a class whose instances are stored in a database) and then when I'm ready to present it, I make a database call that returns a dict of "code":"name" entries and use that to rename everything. Never realized your solution was possible, good to know. I imagine I'll keep using my methods since ``someData`` is often a lambda and I try to stay under 79 chars, but it's good to know this. Thanks!

 The open source platforms are already there to build one from home. It’s going to take someone to make a module in python to scale this town to the everyday small user. And what is really cool is being able to use the VPN and rent GPU Power to make your own super computer. We have already arrived at the point for someone to build their own machine learning AI that learns without us. 
"Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow" is great: http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920052289.do I also really like this for learning the basics about neural networks (I'd read this first if NNs are your focus): http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/
It's enough info to start you off and get you writing working models, but I'd want an experienced data science to help validate your models if there is any significant amount of money on the line.
Definitely refer to the github repo for updated code examples though. I found a few instances where the book code failed to run without error.
So I started reading this and realized he is working on his PhD at MSU. Not a week later, I walked by him in the physics building. I see him all the time now. It's odd to read some random Amazon recommended book and then see the author in your daily life.
Not sure if you saw this Stack Overflow article, but it helped me in the past when I integrated Flask with Paypal. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34324100/paypal-integration-to-flask-application
+1 to “Hands-On Machine Learning” - it’s fantastic. Shame the name is such a mouthful because it genuinely deserves to become a classic.
Not dumb. This is how we learn. Make mistakes, man, and feel free to make them so you are daring.
Say hi to him :)
MIT has a great course on [edX](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-mitx-6-00-1x-11). That's where I got my start and I highly recommend it.
Thanks I’ll check it out!
You can try codecademy. Really easy to start and I think it covers the subjects pretty well (except maybe the lambda function IMO)

Also, if you do an `import Math` then you can get pi with `Math.pi`
 nicknames: List[str] = ['Jonny', 'old mate'] setting the default to a mutable object like that is asking for trouble, set the default to None and then do self.nicknames = nicknames or ['Jonny', 'old mate'] I'm confused by your main question though, is the question about newline placement? or whether space is allowed around `=`, generally you would want to have a new line for every parameter (even self), or roll them along until you run out of room, and then wrap. So pep8, requires no spaces around the `=` when setting default values. and then do all parameters on their own line (with trailing comma) class Person(object): def __init__( self, given_name: str='John', surname: str='Doe', nicknames: List[str]=None, ): pass or run them together until you run out of room before wrapping and align with the open parenthesis... this is probably the more common style, but I don't like it as much (appears to be what you were doing anyway, but it looked wrong to me because I usually go with a longer default line length of 120 chars). class Person(object): def __init__(self, given_name: str='John', surname: str='Doe', nicknames: List[str]=None): pass Other option is to just not care that much about PEP8, like Beazly does.
I'd recommend finding some simple project that someone can hold you accountable for. It's so easy when getting started to "put off the programming for another day". I learned everything once my employer made me accountable for delivering code on time.
&gt;So I started reading this and realized he is working on his PhD at MSU. Not a week later, I walked by him in the physics building. I see him all the time now. Sounds like the plot of a movie. Soon you'll discover that you were Sebastian Raschka all along!
I (and many others) suggest "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python." Certainly for beginners. It's well written and there are plenty of examples/prompts you can follow along with. You can buy the book, but it is also [free](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/).
Start by having a specific goal in mind for using Python. ‘Learn Python’ is a useless goal. When you have a goal, you’ll learn as you go.
If you're into meeting up with people, I'd suggest civic hack nights or civic hackathons in your local area. I've been to [Chi Hack Night (in Chicago)](https://chihacknight.org/), and they had a great vibe happening -- they even offered free food and learning groups. Some of these groups are working on such great things, but they're probably more prevalent in urban areas and college-towns. 
Thanks , although these links don't have what I am looking for, they still are great source for understanding Paypal Integration with Flask. Here is the link to what exactly I am looking into: https://developer.paypal.com/docs/classic/products/permissions/
Thank you. Here is the link to the PayPal option that I am trying to integrate. https://developer.paypal.com/docs/classic/products/permissions/
This package is really helpful, I am looking into it and will contact the developers. If you are a pro and can help here is the link to what I am looking to achieve https://developer.paypal.com/docs/classic/products/permissions/
The best way to learn python is the hard way. Book: Learn Python the Hard Way
The question was about parameters with a type and value passed in so the white space around the operators not the actual code it's self. 
Do you have any suggestions? I looked around in github but nothing spesific catched my eye. 
I agree, however, at least for me, the goal could be as easy as "complete this Python tutorial". I don't necessarily need a project idea. I've learnt the basics of many languages this way.

All I can say is that I used the requests package to make API calls with django and then you just read the API documentation on PayPal's site. If you get stuck feel free to ask.
People use it to predict the stock market.
Start with CodeCademy and try to finish within 10 days, then move to Udemy "Beginner to advanced". Though it's paid one, but you will get some discount, or just search for coupon code. Don't waste too much time on basics.
In my Mechanics Master Degree, we learned it with simple projects and using Jupyter from the Anaconda set. Jupyter is a web interface and easy to use. It's very helpful to have it for rapid prototyping and has all the libraries. 
You could start with this, I guess: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgGIqRFvFFk (have no idea if it's good though).

I've learnt the basics from YouTube tutorials by a guy called Bucky. They're pretty good! 
In Python/Django you don't write much code inside html, you prepare your data into python scripts and then feed an html template with this data. have a look at [Django's templating system](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/ref/templates/language/), a good resource is also [Jinja2's docs](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/2.9/). self-promotion here: Another way is to build the html directly in your python scripts with my open-source project [TemPy](https://hrabal.github.io/TemPy-docs/).

I like the books, Automate the Boring Stuff and Think Python. Both are available in print and for free online. I prefer the printed copies, and buying the book -- if one has the means -- compensates the authors for their hard work. I got them on Indigo but I'm sure they're on Amazon too.

^^^ That. Alot of the content doesn't seem well suited to beginners in the subject. I have a couple of decades coding experience but zero with ML and my maths is pretty basic. Can't seem to find anything geared toward that.
Things got out of hand this weekend. It started with a quiet Sunday morning and a very simple scraper to pull the daily specials from a local restaurant I frequent; just seven little strings...then I thought it would be more useful if I could push it to my phone... The next thing I know, my Sunday is gone but I have a configurable setup for pushing text notifications to subscribers and managing subscriptions, logging, and some other junk. 
http://www.reportlab.com/opensource/ is the most advanced, i guess. and it has great huge manual.
import argparse import csv import gzip import logging if file_name.endswith('.gz') != True and file_name.endswith('.csv') != True: print('Only gzip and csv files supported') raise RuntimeError f = gzip.open(file_name) if file_name.endswith('.gz') else open(file_name) reader = csv.reader(f) print('Processing file %s' % file_name) for row in reader: if len(row) != len(header): print('Row with incorrect number of columns. Got %i but expected %i. Row %s' % (len(header), len(row), str(row))) raise RuntimeError payload = { 'api_key': api_key, 'user_initiated': 'false', 'user': row[0] } for i in xrange(1, len(header)): payload[header[i]] = row[i] try: r = conn.post(API_URL_ROOT, params=payload) r.raise_for_status() except Exception as e: print('Error sending sending user property.

PEP 8 explicitly says that you should use spaces around '=': """ Yes: def munge(sep: AnyStr = None): ... No: def munge(input: AnyStr=None): ... """ see https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#other-recommendations
Is the code up on github? Would be interested in taking a look at it. This is awesome though!
Take a look at sentdex and siraj raval on youtube. 
Same question from yesterday [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/76iz6i/which_is_the_best_book_for_python_machine_learning/).
It depends on what you want to use Python for. If you want to use it for data science then my repository might be helpful: https://github.com/TiesdeKok/LearnPythonforResearch
fair point - what type of jobs?
What's a github? Seriously, no it isn't. I'm too insecure to share my code...but not too insecure to admit that insecurity...it's a weird place to be. Anyway...It took all my courage to post that I actually did this and now I'm all out.

Did you read the next bit down?
You can also say hi to him here "Hi /u/sbt_" 
I strongly recommend learning python 3* rather than 2.7. This might not be what you mean, but I think it's still worth saying. 
It does a pattern match on the path. If it finds a similar path in the list of hashes, it will load that dependency. So the question is irrelevant becuase it will always know where json file located. The json file is only used to tell viper what dependencies manage.py will should load. It will always use the file called by python. There is no need to configure an entry script.

For filling pdf forms there is a command line tool called pdftk. It merges fdf form description files with pdf forms and produces "flattened" pdf. This is a java program, but you can call it from python via subprocess or os.system. Here is an example on how to do it [in php](https://www.sitepoint.com/filling-pdf-forms-pdftk-php). Here are a couple of ready python pdftk wrappers [1](https://github.com/revolunet/pypdftk) [2](https://github.com/rammie/pdfjinja). 
Programmer, data scientist, science scientist, data base admin. Even the life of a normal office drone can be pretty engaging if you have the ability to solve your admin woes with a little bit of python magic.
Looks interesting! Not exactly the same, but for writing RTD (real time data) functions in Python you can also use PyXLL: https://www.pyxll.com/docs/userguide/rtd.html There's an example showing how to stream twitter data into Excel here: https://www.pyxll.com/blog/a-real-time-twitter-feed-in-excel/ It's also possible to do using win32com and this open source package: https://github.com/pyxll/exceltypes 
Books! I agree with automating the boring stuff being a great book to start with. And try try all kinds of online materials too. I personally never liked code academy and I know others feel the same, so give it a shot and if you like it stick with it. If not, you’re not missing out on much.
