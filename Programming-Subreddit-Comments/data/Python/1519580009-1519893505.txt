Thanks! I'm the creator of that course, although as other people have posted here, it really depends on what people mean as "large". I think people see a data set of several GB and think they need some larger solution, when pandas has no problem handling it, or you could even use dask to just break it into chunks locally (which pandas can do as well to some extent). So for people with "semi-big" data I would recommend pandas and numpy. I teach that in my other course: https://www.udemy.com/python-for-data-science-and-machine-learning-bootcamp/?couponCode=MEDIUMPYDSML
Check out the code in this post to see exactly that. I hope to update it to map the frequencies to notes :) http://nickdnickd.com/blog/2018/01/16/Let-There-Be-Sound 
Baring a situation where this question is answered a relevant answer to your query is unlikely. 
You guys make super cool stuff. Nice work!
Oh my god dude you don't write lines that fit in shitty terminals so I can't read it in VIM reeee!!!! Oh my god dude some of your older code has tabs, reeee!!! Can you please fuck off?
As stated above the output range is from 0 Hz to Fs/2, where Fs/2 is half the sample frequency of your input data.
Definitely [UCSD Python for Data Science on EdX](https://www.edx.org/course/python-data-science-uc-san-diegox-dse200x) It will give you a very quick way to learn python basics, python data structures, numpy, pandas, and matplotlib. These tools will allow you to import big data of multiple types into python, manipulate/explore the data, identify correlations and data statistics, and then make illustrations/figures to help you share your data discoveries with others. I must add, they will help you get your machine set up so you actually have the basic tools to do data science (python/jupyter notebooks) Highly recommended, it's a little slow at the start - but picks up quick. Their Jupyter notebooks for each section are pure gold. Try doing 30 mins per day for a week or so and see how it feels. You'll be surprised how much you learn! Good luck!
Which one? I have only seem docassemble.org 
The point of HackerRank is that it's automated, though. For an initial screen, you just want the system to tell you if a person can do some basic coding, yes or no, without any intervention / grading on your part.
QQ: do lawyers spend a lot of time with nlp stuff on discovery docs? What do those tools look like?
I think when I installed tensorflow it didn’t support 3.6. But it looks like it supports 3.3+ now (which I’m assuming might not include the dev branch features) Either way if you setup a conda environment it becomes trivial to maintain so you can update whenever 
R
To start new projects there is no reason to use Python 2.x. Never! Python 3.6+ is better in all aspects.
You could use [requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/user/quickstart/). A package that handles most of the http for you and takes care of cookies and such
It's ok to give another alternatives, but only another language without any discussion is pointless.
Well, that was a self-fulfilling prophecy.
2nd this course. I enjoyed it and it got me into Jupyter Notebooks which I currently love as an alternative to what I would normally do in Matlab.
Yes, Splinter + headless Chrome. Very easy to implement.
You're the man dude. I moved from C++/Matlab to Python relatively pain-free using your courses.

Oh that's awesome!! I use Debian on my personal computer and servers and didn't hear about this. Do you have a link to any further info on this migration? I searched a bit and didn't see it in the Python FAQ or Python packaging guidelines.
Could you tell me where you find those data sets in the first place?
I'll check that out. I would recommend looking into NLTK library.
It is specified to return two decimal places you should do it like that. That shows you read and understood the specification correctly and wrote a precise implementation. At my university in CS101 we had a task to output "Hello, World!". Some students omitted the comma and (since it is checked automatically by a script) didn't get full score.
I've pretty much bought all your python classes at this point. Love your teaching style. Keep up the good work.
I'm set on learning Python and don't necessarily need it for scientific computing and/or statistical/mathematical analysis just yet. So while I understand where you're coming from, if I were to learn R, it'd be in addition to Python rather than as substitution.
It's something on top of code if that means that your code is not going to change because of adding logging statements. Read [Good logging practice](https://fangpenlin.com/posts/2012/08/26/good-logging-practice-in-python/) and adapt the code to python 3, for example you don't need to use %s for logging formating you can use the format fucntion or f-strings
Just curious, are you [this person](https://github.com/DenisCarriere/geocoder)?
/r/bigdata is a thing too just fwiw.
I feel Python 2.7 is something like Windows xp was, everybody sticks to it til support runs out and even then someone will still continue using it
Dryscape supports rendering dynamic JavaScript content without opening a browser.

In python 3 it's quite common.
I think this could be pretty useful already in the prototyping phase of a scraper where you can easily dissect the page in your REPL. Offtopic: This is one of the few times where it is acceptable to have "&lt;something&gt; for humans" which isn't requests ;)

The way forward is to get the `adb logcat` output (I think it's `buildozer android logcat`), to see the error message from the crash. You did set the `p4a.bootstrap` option to `pygame`, right? It uses sdl2 by default, so that should be the first step.. You may also need to use `kivy==1.8.0` in requirements, if it was built for an older version.
https://matplotlib.org/basemap It will do everything you need in matplotlib.
N-players online pong would be a lot of fun, with some twists like multiple balls, powerups that reverse controls...
Shouldn't matter, as your solution will need to be matching up points in 3d anyway.
First, FFT algorithms often make assumptions about the layout of your data and order the output in a not-nice way, do `fftshift(fft(fftshift(fx)))` to make the center sample 0Hz or DC. The DFT (and by proxy, FFT which is just an implementation of the DFT) assumes equally spaced samples. It knows nothing about the units of your function, but it does know something about the relationship between frequency and length (frequency is inverse length). The algorithm will spit out a result that has units of cycles per sample, which might be easier to think about grammatically as cycles per pixel. Sampling theory also says that we can't represent a sinusoid with less than two samples per cycle. If you had 1 second sample spacing, 1/1= 1Hz. But you can only capture up to half of this without aliasing, so you can only go up to 0.5Hz. The FFT algorithm will produce the full result, so the output ranges (loosely) from -0.5Hz to +0.5Hz. Because your input signal is real valued, it has the property of being hermetian symmetric, i.e. the signal at -xHz is equal to the signal at +xHz. I said loosely because another convention of FFTs is to always return a sample at 0Hz or DC. For an even length array, this means you lose one sample at one end, and the convention is to drop the positive signed one. Here's a script that shows all of the units, import numpy as np from numpy.fft import fftshift, fft, fftfreq from matplotlib import pyplot as plt plt.style.use('bmh') tmax, N, f = 5, 100, 0.2 x = np.linspace(0, tmax, N) # x is in seconds y = np.sin(2 * np.pi * f * x) # sin(2pi f x) is a sine wave of frequency f with x of unit time (seconds) dx = x[1] - x[0] # given to fftfreq, sample spacing y_fourier = fftshift(fft(fftshift(y))) / N x_fourier_numpy = fftshift(fftfreq(N, dx)) x_fourier_manual = np.arange(-N//2, N//2) / (dx*N) # start, stop for arange, stop is excluded assert np.allclose(x_fourier_numpy, x_fourier_manual) visual_padding = 3 fig, axs = plt.subplots(ncols=2, figsize=(10,4)) axs[0].plot(x, y) axs[0].set(xlabel='time, s', ylabel='amplitude, a.u.') axs[1].stem(x_fourier, np.abs(y_fourier)) axs[1].set(xlim=(-visual_padding*f, visual_padding*f), xlabel='Frequency, Hz', ylabel='Amplitude, a..u') plt.show() You can play with f and N. If you increase N, dx will get smaller so the extent of the output in the Fourier plane is increased, but the sample spacing in that plane remains the same (so you would still only have samples at 0.2, 0.4, 0.6Hz on that plot with those parameters). If you want to make more densely sampled points in Fourier space, you need to pad the input array by making `tmax` bigger.
Off topic but I'm using your python boot camp course and it's great, thanks. 
Wow that's interesting. I will google it.
At this point if you are to program new software in Python, it would be rather stupid to use anything other than the most recent 3.x release. For one the vast majority of the useful libraries have been ported. Second you don't want to build around old libraries that will most certainly become unsupported soon. Beyond that it is part of life to find the perfect library for your needs written in another language that you don't want to use, can't use or is obsolete. It will happen sooner or later.
You probably want to use the `csv.writer.writerow` function to handle any quoting issues. https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/csv.html#writer-objects 
Looks nice Kenneth! Is this intended to replace the usual requests + beautifulsoup combo?
Thanks!
Thank you!
As a Kenneth Reitz project he's kind of obligated to call it "for humans" at this point.
Not sure which data sets you're referring to? You can check out Kaggle for lots of data sets to play around with, or UC Irvine ML Repo
Also print(foo, bar, baz, end="", file=fobj) which in Python 2 would have to be spelled print &gt;&gt;fobj, foo, bar, baz, which… yeah nah. Using `print` to write to a file in P3 actually makes sense rather than just obfuscate.
exactly!
I mean that function a opens the file - stores the file handle - and then the application calls function b,c,d,e &amp; f to process the file - and then function g closes it. I have absolutely no issue with calling more than one function from inside a with block :-)
I understand what you are saying now. Normally in Python we would put all those functions into a block to take advantage of the "with" context manager, but the difference is purely stylistic. I don't think you're doing anything wrong, but it's slightly unusual.
Important features I think are missing from the sheet (over some which are like star-imports-in-functions which… isn't exactly an essential feature): ### Keyword-only parameters In Python 2, python-level parameters are pretty much all positional *and* keyword (the C API allows positional-only, keyword-only and mixed). Python 3 introduced keyword-only parameters in pure Python functions: def foo(a, b, *, c): `c` is a required parameter (no default value) but *must* be passed as keywords, calling `foo(1, 2, 3)` would be an error. This allows for much clearer API. Note that the lone `*` can also be an `*args` spec. Incidentally, 3.8 *may* introduce positional-only parameters at the Python level. I think it's slightly less important but it would be neat regardless. ### Chained exceptions Exception objects got significantly upgraded in Python 3, first with chained exceptions which are very confusing the first time you see them (the most recent exception is at the bottom) but also oh-so-helpful: if you raise an exception while catching an other, Python will automatically link the two and the default traceback dump will show both exceptions. This is *invaluable* when debugging. You can override this with `raise new_exception from old-exception-or-none`. Using `from None` will break the chain, using `from &lt;some exception&gt;`. ### OSError subclasses In Python 2, OSError is a leaf class, from which you can inconveniently get-and-check an `errno`… within the `except` block. In Python 3.3, OSError is a the head of an entire hierarchy of errors matching various errnos, with clearer names and better convenient. ### PATHLIB!
I recently switched to Bandwidth from plivo after looking at Twilio and Bandwidth, because MMS is important, and Twilio has it, but they don't do group texts. If you receive a group text you receive it as if it was only sent to you individually. Bandwidth has a beta feature for full group text that I am waiting for. They call it messaging 2.0. They are taking forever on it, it course. Plus Twilio is really expensive. Obscenely so. Twilio had much better docs and tutorials though, like this one. I'll give them that. I just can't fathom that being enough to make up for the cost and uncaring support. (If you have huge volume I hear they care more.)
I agree - the challenge is when you are trying to provide an API which does the file openining and closing and data processing functionality. that API can't easily use a with block when opening the file. In general though a with block is the best way to go - where possible.
Indeed I didn't mean to argue but to philosophize about the difference, so thanks for being cordial! I like your interpretation when you say that, although indeed for the program there is a magic number, there isn't in the reading of it to a user. It's a subtle point and interesting to think about.
Thanks for making this! I’m looking forward to playing around with it!
Wow. Amazing. I've PM's you, but I'd love to repay you for this somehow? 
Seems like just a bit of an oversight to start thinking about how it's going to be deployed *after* writing the code. For future reference, I'd recommend golang for this purpose, as it is deployed as a single binary file.
Never used hackerrank which is quite funny.
I can't agree more. Django is a much quicker way to produce a quality solution because all the integration is done for you. 
As others have noted, but seemingly not in the same reply, there's two questions here: 1. What is "large"? 2. What do you want to do with it? You'll get much better answers if you give people some specific details. 
Complete newbie should read the sidebar and post in the right sub. The individual print statements you're using implicitly print on new lines. In your for loop, you could create a list with the evaluations and print them all after the loop.
 1. strgen.StringGenerator(reg_exp).render() gives you a random string, this is in no way a systematic way to search. 2. also to really speed things up, just check the dns server, there are python modules for that. see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11618118/python-check-if-a-hostname-is-resolved 3. An I agree that there are just too many names 12 character long with 11 domains. 
Fair enough - I assumed you were OP. Still, browsing your history, you seem like you have some really over the top anger issues.
Awesome awesome awesome awesome. Like how easy the XPath selection is.
You seem like the kind of guy who should drop programming and pick up psychology.
There isn't a single coherent sentence in this entire paragraph. It's actually quite impressive.
What a superhuman effort to make something like this in about 24 hours! *checks file size* Okay, even if the Python source is only 225 lines (including whitespace and comments), that's still a Kenneth-Reitz-level effort! :)
I really ought to learn golang. Python did end up being super useful due to the nature of this project. 
another kick ass project, will def test it out
Why though? Just not a fan of BeautifulSoup?
Because you can `program` away a `$USER`'s sense of sarcasm very easily.
I use [Inno Setup](http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php) for this. You can call small Inno Setup Scripts containing all app infos from the command line using os.system. Create a small app_deployment.py that calls PyInstaller then create a setup.exe ready for deployment.
R for data science.
You don't need to cover the list into a set to do a membership check like that. Just do "if x in list".
You can try to use Kivy's pygame bootstrap, as terminak has described, but I don't know if this will actually work well. This bootstrap does use pygame, but was always a bit hacked together for Kivy's use, and I'm not sure if things like touch input will actually work with normal pygame. That said, it can't hurt to try, and `adb logcat` is definitely the way to go to debug it.
When importing from Quandl my financial data goes descending instead of ascending. So the dates I set is 1995 to 2017, but it lists the data going from 2017 to 1995, how can i flip that around?
Actually sets seem to have exactly the same sort order as the keys in a dictionary, which seems to be based on the hash value.
As /u/pwoosam pointed out, your problem is that you don't understand what your data structures are capable of. It looks like you don't need to use sets at all. A lot of the operations that make the set data structure really cool just don't make any sense when preserving order.
If you think sets should be ordered, then you will need to specify an ordering predicate. But some sets don't have a native ordering predicate; that's why they are sets and not lists. Sets have an equality predicate, not an ordering predicate.
SQL for database queries.
No you don't as of Python 3.6, that was the point of the post. Python 3.6 dicts are ordered by insertion. while sets still do not have a defined order.
Someone link the xkcd comic about creating a 17th standard with the intention to be the end all the standards when you're really just making more modules that do the same thing.
Thanks for making this and sharing it as open source!
One of the strengths of python programs are that they are portable, and, at least with pip, you can use wheel files for any machine type. &gt; Wheel is currently considered the standard for built and binary packaging for Python. https://packaging.python.org/discussions/wheel-vs-egg/ 
No, I think my point still stands. It looks like you're trying to squeeze extra performance out of your checks. Why don't you try testing what you actually do instead of a component of what you actually do? &gt;&gt;&gt; timeit(stmt='1000000 in l', setup='l=list(range(999999))', number=1000) 8.690355000000011 &gt;&gt;&gt; timeit(stmt='1000000 in set(l)', setup='l=list(range(999999))', number=1000) 40.27572799999996
That's not what you're doing. When you find yourself typing "x in set(l)", you're converting the list to a set every time. If you're in a position to use the same set each check, then why do you care what order the elements in the set are in?
Looks like this is mostly a wrapper around [pyquery](https://github.com/gawel/pyquery/) (a jquery-like library for python) and some [parse](https://github.com/r1chardj0n3s/parse). Seems a bit disingenuous to make it seem like this library is doing all the heavy lifting of parsing the web page.
it could slow down `set` the `set`type is a collection with math's set operations, like `contains`, it does not required ordering to do its job. python3.6 dict having insert-order behaviour is a implemention detail they decided its a "cool feature", IMHO its a bad idea to enforce this implementation detail into the language, some day they could found a even faster way to implement the dict, and not they are stuck with this one. Also, I dont rely in dict order, its a mapping, not a sequence.
Well, most of the work is being done by other established libraries - notably [pyquery](https://github.com/gawel/pyquery/) and[parse](https://github.com/r1chardj0n3s/parse).
The sheer definition of a set is, that it cannot have an order. No matter what you are trying to do. As long as there is one living mathematician in this world, you have to deal with it.
That's a good argument, if it could slow down sets. Haven't heard that before. Are you sure about that? Actually insert-order *was* an implemention detail originally in Python 3.6, but Guido has later made it an oficial spec, see https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2017-December/151283.html So in some literal sense Python is stuck with this one (or will be when Python 3.7 is released), and my question is if doing it for sets wouldn't be an idea as well :-) I can see several advantages (but agree that speed is important). 
Do you know who Kenneth Reitz is? You might want to look him up.
It shouldn't be relied upon anyway. &gt; The order-preserving aspect of this new implementation is considered an implementation detail and should not be relied upon https://docs.python.org/3.8/whatsnew/3.6.html#deprecated-build-options
Kenneth Reitz (the author of this and the `requests` library) pretty much invented the "&lt;something&gt; for humans" tagline. It is a well deserved tagline for his projects. ;)
Guido has later changed his mind on that: &gt;&gt;&gt; "Make it so. "Dict keeps insertion order" is the ruling. Thanks! See (this post on the python-dev mailing list)[https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2017-December/151283.html]
Yes
They're both holding 999999 elements, all elements are the same. The only difference is if the container is a list or a set. Set membership testing is just ridiculously much faster than list membership testing:-)
&gt; If sets were ordered by insertion, then it's possible that they won't do the other things that they do well, as quickly. That can be a valid point. &gt; And guaranteeing order of insertion as a function of the set's interface just doesn't make sense for a set. The same could be said about dicts, but they're ordered now, without loss of speed. I think if sets wouldn't lose speed doing this, it could improve some coding patterns.
That was my bad for reading your post wrong. Lol My most humble apologies :p You could write a class that maintains both collections, a set and a list for your different needs. Or you can do a quick Google search for some ordered set implementations. But sets do not account for order by design as they are meant for set arithmetic and to do it efficiently. Having sets be ordered by default would drastically hinder performance as you've seen with your list and set comparison above. Checking for and comparing hashes is more efficient than iterating over an list in order by insertion. Perhaps you can sort your lists? Or keep track of the insertion order with another data structure like a dict. Or just make that class that has both a list and a set.
Sure. But anyone can plug together some libraries and get them to work together. Considering the various interfaces the resulting combined functionality could have and deciding on the best "For Humans" one takes a little more effort.
I don't maintain the win branch but my co-worker who does has chosen py2exe and custom work that launches a setup guide in a cmd window the first time. This works for our purposes but if you can pull off an MSI package using pyinstaller then go for it.
Do you see anything strange when you open the CSV in a text editor? What is the encoding? If it is UTF-8, then you should have something like open('example.csv', encoding='utf-8')
Yes, when I see the file in Notepad++ , I se that it's saved in UTF-8
The problem is that sets are much more than quick item lookup. Introducing ordering to a set doesn't really mesh with the other things that sets are *really* good at. What does ordering mean after an intersection or difference?
You could use a dictionary with their `user.id` as keys.
Great questions! 1. Animations / Time Sliders - could you add this as a feature request on the Github repo? We can add this to the roadmap! 2. Add a geotiff - you can do this today by uploading your geotiff to your Mapbox Studio account and dropping it into a style you use in Mapboxgl-Jupyter. Were also working on raster image support completely client side from a bumpy array of pixels - like you'd typically use in a machine learning feature extraction task. Stay tuned on Github!
Post the code you have already. 
I agreed is really useful, but it still prefer if it was not a python spec, because like I said, if they ever found a faster way to implement dict that cant garantee insert order, then It would not be accepted.
Seen that around. Looks good!
🙄
For humans...cringe.
You forgot the // in your url.. https://
I've always understood that sets are so fast in membership checks BECAUSE they are unordered. Also i believe python 3 only uses an ordered dictionary when created with **kwargs in a function call
Writing a library isn't creating a standard
That's what I was hinting at :P
No problem. It happens all the time. Good luck with the book. I really enjoyed it!
Did you use a tool to scaffold out the package? 
http://lmgtfy.com/?q=twitter+api+exact+phrase+search -&gt; https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35733825/python-twitter-api-how-to-search-for-tweets-containing-an-exact-phrase
yes, as others have said, the 'for humans' is taken from his 'requests' library messaging. It fits.
&gt; requests + beautifulsoup comb good. Beautifulsoup could be a bit painful at times.
e1, e_rest* = dom.select(‘user.input’) Also works: the first element becomes e1 and the rest are stored as a list in e. But in that case you’re still doing more than necessary by assigning the rest when it’s unneeded. I think what you’ve written is fine 
&gt; GIMP GIMP's dead anyway.
If you want to iterate over the list, you can use for item in el: print (item) # or do something else with it If you want to access only the first item, el[0] would be my choice. You can check for existing by using `if el`, though most likely using try and except would be better to prevent potential errors.
I already visited that site and that method did not work.
Bias is not the same as fake news. A biased publication can be 100% accurate about all the good things one party is doing and all the bad things another is doing: that's not fake news. Meanwhile, another publication can fabricate incorrect and/or misleading articles about all parties equally: fake news, not biased.
I tried to do this in selenium. I had no luck finding the tag. I bet this could be used for a lot of other things.
Thank you dude!
Hey man thanks for making this course. You did a *really* great job on it. I've been working through it for about a week or two now and am learning a lot from it. I'm looking forward to your SQL course as well.
Then it helps to give a description of what you've tried, and what part of it wasn't working
Cython. 
Python is already good at data science. A language which works well with python is one which does something python doesn't.
Just wanted to add that I’ve referred a number of developers looking to get into data science to your courses.
Yep that's why they are separate categories in my model
I have been using numpy, pandas, and matplotlib to extract measurement data from CMM (coordinate measuring machine) reports in order to produce graphs so that we can see what the effects of temperature fluctuations do to the assembly.

I feel your pain! I did this my first week on the job. Opening the file (even in notepad++) was pure hell but I needed to see what lines were repeating.
C. With a little bit of C knowledge, you can do a lot with ctypes or cffi. You can use a tiny bit of C to optimize performance critical parts. It's also very useful if you want to create bindings for some existing library.

There is [this page](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/scenarios/admin/) which is an overview of modules mainly concerning deployment and configuration, though there is a bit on monitoring. A search finds other online docs [such as this](https://python-for-system-administrators.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). For a more "nuts and bolts" resource look at this [ActiveState search](https://code.activestate.com/recipes/langs/python/tags/sysadmin/), which is a collection of code fragments doing various sysadmin things. Searching for "book sysadmin python" gets a few hits, but I don't know how good they are
working with the azure ADF 2.0 python sdk. Trying to get some of the pipeline flows working programatically.
One guess: the Umlaut in the path could possibly be part of the problem.
theonion.com: High accuracy Seems about right.
Im not sure what point you’re making about the imports.
This looks awesome, but also expensive for projects you want to publish. and officially, you'd need a commercial license for private access... Pricing is here: https://www.mapbox.com/pricing/ 
Guido isn't coming for you in your sleep if you write unpythonic code, btw. You should aim to write pythonic code, but it's ok if something looks funny from time to time. Now, if you need the first element, just take the first element. Anything else would be unpythonic.
remote available? 
any replies? 
Why not use [Hypothesis](https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/master/)? As well as trying a far greater variety of input and reporting minimal examples on failure, [it can automatically generate data to match a Django model](https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/master/django.html)!
Un
To give a quick idea of what this module builds on and what it might do. Maybe I can assume it'll give me an alt. user agent if my current user agent gets blocked. 
The while point of this post was that you wouldn't even need to convert between lists and sets, if sets were ordered. So the test is not incorrect, if ordered sets are as fast as unordered sets.
&gt; What does insertion order mean after an intersection or difference? I would do "values are inserted from left". So the questions is really if ordered sets are possible, without sacrificing the good stuff in the current (unordered) set.
I see no reason to use this over LXML in combination with requests? LXML supports both css selectors and xpath. It is also likely to be faster than Pyquery which this library relies on. Additionally, I'd rather handle user agent stuff on my own rather than use the underlying library.
I don't get why this is better than beautifulsoup. It has always worked really nicely for me.
This is really interesting. I don't have a use for it yet, but I like the example of disallowing prints. It's something that I always dislike in group projects when someone forgets to remove print calls. I'll check it out in my next project, thanks for your work :)
It's a good book. Numpy, pandas and matplotlib are decently covered, sometimes I would have put more emphasis on some topics and less on others. The part about machine learning (scikit-learn ) is really nice imho. What's more: the author, Jake VanderPlas, has made the entire book available as jupyter notebooks on his github page: https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook 
See where I'm calling **test** on the value returned from **input**? There.
Python is not only older than Java and .net, but it is also way more portable, used in more diverse situations (nobody does scripting, geography, matlab like analysis and the like in Java/C#) and is embeded in 2 of the most OSes. But taking java and c# as a model of compatibility is a joke. First, in the 90'/00', Java had so many incompatible versions existing in paralllel in was not funny (god the nightmare of the browser java plugin updates and the dread of programming on phones with java before dalvik...). And .net wasn't even usable on anything else than windows. Plus, here is the kicker: Python doesn't have multibillions dollars company backing it. The PSF actually has an incredibly small budget, with a small number of people actually pay to work on Python. 
So if my input was phonename = input("What is the name of the new phone? ") How would I check "phonename". Thank you for your assistance. 
You can say phonename = input() and then you say if (test(phonename)): I think
Aren't we all?
Use an ordered dict with null values against each key. That should give you both the ordering and fast membership test.
With: if test(phonename): [do something if it passes] else: [do something if it fails] Since I've no idea what you're trying to do with it, that's about as far as I can point you.
I find Python + C++ and a bindings lib almost unbeatable. You can work in python and optimize in C++ very easily. Gives you the best of both worlds.
Whilst I do agree with you completely about the point you made, as someone who works in data science it is beneficial to know both if that is the route you want to go down as a) some companies mainly work with R, and b) there are some things which are easier or done better with R. However, I would still learn SQL, HTML, css, Javascript etc first though
Fam, I dun wrote this little module to make logging work the way I want it to by default, and cut down on boilerplate a bit. Let me know what you think.
Postgres isn't a programming language. It's a database. 
I think he's saying that this library is nothing new, it's really just a wrapper around functionality of existing libraries. You could do the same things using just the underlying libraries and save yourself some dependency bloat. 
Not to mention it seems like it's just using LXML under the hood anyway. 
Got a new job. Getting to know the system well before diving into some refactoring.
Thanks for releasing this. What's the performance like? The standard library logger sometimes causes a noticeable performance drop.
Heard of logzero? https://github.com/metachris/logzero I think it was developed with similar motivation, but seems more fully fledged.
Ok... But thanks
No, San Francisco only.

why link to the tweet that is just a link to a course?
Since there's no redundancy in an ec2-based solution it has to be more robust.

Lol fixed. 
Honestly, unless they bring something very new or unique to the table, /r/learnpython is there for a reason.
May I link this comment to issue? I need some time to think about your suggestions. thx
Agree but learning python doesn't stop and thus it's common for one with some experience to write a blog with tutorials or a new introduction to python for newbies. How many have been posted here? 
Any thoughts on why they keep getting upvoted?
[removed]
We should just use Regex instead!
This module provides a nice api, but combining and hiding the nice parts from those modules.
Is this dude working for EnrollCourses? Check his profile, he's only posted links to tweets of this twitter account..

Cool game and explanation
Sure but new/unique is subjective. I wouldn't mind all tutorials going to /r/learnpython regardless of perceived content
Here's a sneak peek of /r/learnpython using the [top posts](https://np.reddit.com/r/learnpython/top/?sort=top&amp;t=year) of the year! \#1: [My new book, "Cracking Codes with Python" is now available and free to read online!](https://np.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/7sigre/my_new_book_cracking_codes_with_python_is_now/) \#2: [I'm releasing a free code for the "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python" Udemy course](https://np.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/7fxork/im_releasing_a_free_code_for_the_automate_the/) \#3: [90% Python in 90 minutes](https://np.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/661o5a/90_python_in_90_minutes/) ---- ^^I'm ^^a ^^bot, ^^beep ^^boop ^^| ^^Downvote ^^to ^^remove ^^| [^^Contact ^^me](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=sneakpeekbot) ^^| [^^Info](https://np.reddit.com/r/sneakpeekbot/) ^^| [^^Opt-out](https://np.reddit.com/r/sneakpeekbot/comments/7o7jnj/blacklist/)
I'm 100% behind the concept, but the implementation needs a lot of work. I swtiched to Python for all new projects about 9 months ago and I'm loving every second of it. But I'm about to unsub from r/python because it's so weak. Your fixes do almost nothing to address that. Really, I'd just ban any general python tutorial plus any tutorials for over-posted tools (tensorflow, pandas, etc). I'd also ban any self-congratulatory junk like "omg python is #1 on siteyouveneverheardof.com!!!!11"
FWIW, I disagree with the idea that IDEs are a crutch. Don't feel bad for using them. I've used VS Code (with the python extension), WingIDE, Spyder, and have heard good things about pycharm. Find one you like and use it--especially for a beginner there won't be much to distinguish them. 
If I want to learn Python, there's a subreddit for that. Maybe the delineation shouldn't be between "beginners" &amp; "experienced" Python devs
A service limit increase is trivially simple and is there to protect you from an unexpected billing.
I believe it’s the magical path to escape the maze + boosting your point to over 9k :)))))
Someone subscribed to both /r/python and /r/learnpython probably isn't going to check which sub a tutorial is posted to before upvoting.
Why is this posted here and not on r/learnpython?
My issue is, how do I use that as a data source? Do I have to download or install something? If so, how?
http://downforeveryoneorjustme.com/pypi.python.org
pyquery relies on lxml, as does this library.
Though I do reference this: https://github.com/kennethreitz/setup.py
read that as Material Design - Patterns :D
It's just an invitation :) HF !
As a NL resident, I feel extra left out.
Totally understand the concern re: if your project blows up on social media. If you have a public project and it blows up with millions of API calls, tweet us @mapbox with your visual and we'll comp you (nice job making an amazing visualization,btw)! If you're building an internal application at work, Mapbox is free to use for development and POC purposes on your team. If several members of your team are using Mapbox ongoing for months, you'll want to grab a pay as you go commercial account. Mapboxgl Jupyter doesnt require using Mapbox API calls. The project is open source. It will render any data you throw at it from vector tiles, wms rasters, videos, or geojson. It doesnt require the use of Mapbox API calls, so if you prefer to self-host map tile data such as open map tiles, you absolutely can.
This question intrigues me; I have never thought there would be a tool for such a thing. What would you recommend?
So now an operation that was commutative is now no longer?
There was a library posted from Github here yesterday, a popular one (can't remember right now) and one of the tracked issues was about tutorials on the correct structure of a Flask app. There was a *lot* of good conversation about how the top search results for tutorials on the matter were extremely bad examples and teaching newbies, the ones who need them most, really bad practices. So while upvotes are supposed to weed bad examples out, it's a huge challenge to moderate on the quality of tutorials and allowing bad tutorials is only making the problem worse. I think tagging is OK, but a better option would be to leave tutorials out completely and just have a curated list in the sidebar. This would require a detailed review of the tutorials by the mod team though. 
Haha I understand :) We are currently organizing a Java Challenge for the Netherlands wich should begin in April ! I'll let you know ^^
Visual Studio Code has a similar feature, although only during debugging [when you set "debug.inlineValues" to true](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/tips-and-tricks#_inline-values). Then there is the [LivePy plugin](https://github.com/donkirkby/live-py-plugin) for Emacs, Eclipse and PyCharm.
And if you're resident in Belgium, you can participate :)
I'm not sure what you mean? What did he do? Could you explain? (I understand other people understand, but I also want to understand!) 
Ah, cool, thanks!
At first I was like what does this guy know about $100+ in ad words, then I saw the name. Cool. You make some great videos :)
Starting a python package requires a bit of boilerplate. I know there are some tools that help generate that boilerplate. Django has a tool to help start a django app, I know there are others. This author has his own template for starting packages.
I think it should be mandatory for the poster to at least write a short description of the tutorial, what it is trying to achieve, provide links to the libraries used and other relevant info. Instead of just dumping a link for viewership.
kanboard
Same question here. Any experience using Django-Timepiece? 
No. 
Sidebar: `If you are about to ask a question, please consider r/learnpython or the learn python discord. Homework-style questions will be removed, and you'll be encouraged to post there instead.` Tip: google `python get todays date` and `python compare dates`
This was amazing thank you for your answer 
Spyder, which comes with the Anaconda Python distribution, as well as available separately, has a [variable explorer](https://pythonhosted.org/spyder/variableexplorer.html).
Isn't this the proverbial situation when you're suggesting a technical fix for a social problem? Tags generally make any kind of info more usable and easier to search, but I doubt they will stop spammers and clickbaiters. If it happens, I'll be happy.
Sounds like feature-cruft to solve a single use-case. I'm not a fan of breaking understood convention to make something faster. The orderedset library is still there for you.
A programming language and its third party library ecosystem is usually very much info, so taking will guesses will get you old. This will give you a headstart: import datetime; datetime.datetime.now()
Could we please refer to these sorts of posts as /R/Python Enhancement Proposals, or RPEPs?
`if x in list` is not the same as `if x in set` if the membership test is conducted many many times, while the list is only converted to set once for the purpose of this test. (I think OP's example is being misunderstood (or is not 100% clear) to imply that OP performs the list to set conversion each time they conduct the membership test). 
Not just tutorial spam. We're also seing a growing number of non-effort summarizing articles, like "10 obscure libraries no-one should know about, but I can pawn it of as news, so my link to yet another bootcamp will be seen" of a few days back. What's worse is that they seem to be posted by well-established spammers, as they almost immediately jumps to 50+ upvotes. After that point is reached, it's almost impossible (due to the lemming effect) to vote such blatant spam away. 
Funny the/r/learnpython mod said they remove most tutorials and the bot says top 3 links are links for learning python.
I had some time this afternoon, so I thought I'd give this a shot. I think you'll be able to work with it. I'm a novice Python tinkerer, so no warranty or assurances given ;) https://gist.github.com/anonymous/4cea14959be08d280d533e26c4907b60
&gt; No tutorials allowed at all. I highly doubt tags will fix the spam. I'm totally OK with learning how to speed up my matplotlib code by 500x or learning PyPy or Cython or how pickle works. I think that's advanced enough to benefit the average person. I'm not OK with tutorials that cover for loops.
It appears to be a RESTful API. So you just need to query it. If you need that explained... well you'll need an HTTP(S) client, and you'll probably need to do quite a bit of learning. But reading the documentation will be necassary. 
Correct. And of that is the case, this is a good use of set. Being able to remove duplicates and search by hash is more performant than iteration. However, what OP wants is a data structure that keeps track of insertion order, searches by hash, and possibly allows duplicates? OPs requirements are not clear. But the point of this is should sets keep track of insertion order and the answer is no. We would lose the many benefits of a set.
To be fair, the the top 2 posts are fully fledged books that you can get for free and from a well recognized author/contributor. 
A talk/tutorial targeted to experienced/professionals should be in r/python imho. eg. someone recently posted a new [blog](http://python-patterns.guide/gang-of-four/decorator-pattern/) by brandon rhodes
I am fine with learning. I am very eager to do that. I just feel a little overwhelmed and confused as to where to start. One of the reasons why I'm sticking with only Python for now. I was getting a little too over the top by also trying to learn HTML, CSS and Java
Can we try to be more concrete? So I've posted links to /r/Python from my blog in the past: * https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/7lhth6/how_do_async_for_loops_work_in_python/ * https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/7el2yf/javascript_promises_are_equivalent_to_pythons/ * https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/72keq7/how_do_you_rate_limit_calls_with_pythons_asyncio/ * https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/67uf8s/how_do_you_limit_memory_usage_with_asyncio/ * https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/63jnkp/what_color_is_your_python_async_library/ Is this considered as spam? Would you call those tutorials? Is this acceptable? Thanks!
As I said, if it's advanced enough to benefit the average person, I think its' fine. They makeup a small percentage of what's typically posted.
Excellent. I found BSoup to be pretty annoying to get going with. I love the way you set up with tutorial in the readme
Pip installable? 
Sure, it's "fine," but we're trying to make rules, where having something that isn't subjective is ideal, so that's what we try to seek. As I asked, is there a reason you'd rather go with this subjective rule for this subreddit, instead of just ruling that anything that isn't an official-sourced tutorial should go to /r/learnpython?
/u/Sentdex had a bot for this. [Here](https://youtu.be/7uhMemi2mFc) you can see his work.
Hmm... Thanks for the hint, I didn't think bout that. But unfortunately it isn't the cause of the problem (just tried it out...).
*has* /u/Spam_Detector_Bot/ still hard at work :) 
Oh haha sorry.
&gt; those tutorials are many times not very well built That's what the down-vote button is for. If it's a bad post, mark it as such. I don't think we need special tags.
I find those ones interesting and I'd like to see them on the main page. Like most people, I don't visit learnpython regularly.
Here is another option - get it straight from Nasdaq using the tutorial and code for copy paste from here https://www.scrapehero.com/scrape-nasdaq-stock-market-data/
for python, you will want 'requests', you can pip install it.
Define objectively *"not very well built"*. Because that's how you get censorship.
Expanding on that I prefer unpythonic code that works to pythonic code that doesn't.
&gt; So python3 will just be a symlink to the new python4 binary? This is (one of the many reasons) a few of us have been screaming about the absurd idiocy of PEP394 since 2011. It was a completely ham-handed way of punting this interpreter-naming football down the field, and between the deprecation of 2.x and the release of 4.x it's finally time to pay that piper. Arch Linux maintainers solved this problem 100% correctly in 2010 (i.e. python will always points to the latest interpreter, python2 always points to the latest python2.x, python2.7 always points to the latest python2.7.x, python3 always points to the latest python3, etc. etc.). This *permanently* fixes the problem in a very logical and organized fashion. If your script NEEDS exactly 2.7 you add that dependency, then call/shebang the binary called "python2.7". If you are fine rolling with the latest version, then you simply depend on python and then call/shebang the binary called "python". Permanently and logically fixed? Then a bunch of blowhards showed up in 2011 and wrote PEP394 (because people writing python2 code need compatibility today and 10 years to change their shebangs!) which locked every other distro into the current bullshit-cycle, and let everyone simply ignore this problem until python2 deprecation (which is now right around the corner!). Do you know what I have to do on my arch box when python2 is deprecated? Nothing. How about when python6 is released? Not a goddamn thing. Do you have any idea what a shitshow my RHEL boxes are going to be at each one of these junctures? All of my vendor scripts still assume python==python2.... because why not. And now I have an additional decade of shit calling python3 as a shortcut for (the latest version) to deal with when the binary flips to python4... etc. etc.
It's not (only) about spam. My rationale goes like this: - OP wants to share a tutorial - fellow redditors at first sight should get an idea about the content quality. - OP can flag own post as recommend/feedback/request. - redditors can relate. If they are experienced on topic and want to offer feedback to a new tutorial one wrote, they will. If they are unexperienced they can follow the recommended tutorials. If the post aims to discussion, others can contribute with their "favorite" tutorials etc. How does this sound?
Problem with the tutorials specifically is that is claims expertise. And I believe we should protect this community, by declaring the level of expertise behind such tutorials. Recommending a tutorial I enjoyed is one thing, and writing my own tutorial on how to use python lists is a totally different thing. OPs should do both, but the rest should be able to distinct those two.
Taiga.io looks great, and has a free self-hosted option - designed for agile teams and includes support for scrum, kanban, and epic boards.
Saying that tutorials is for learning =&gt; tutorials should be in /r/learnpython doesn't make much sense, because we never stop learning. The top post of the year in here is a tutorial. And it should be that way. We want to learn, we want to discuss, we want to get the language updates and news. There is no reason to split all those apart. Is there any reason you don't want tutorials in /r/python? 
Just created it for you. If mods think it as a good move, they can mention it in their description to keep spammers away.
Thats me. and its him.
Now you have two problems.
So, uh, best = the way you wish it worked? Ok.
User id is best key for anything discord related. It will never change because it is generated from the time account was created in, and they all are unique no matter what, so you can always be sure that one ID refers to the person you want it to refer (unless they switch accounts).
Yeah so just have keys as ID's, problem solved :)
As I mentioned elsewhere in this thread, we remove most tutorial links in r/learnpython because we think people learning python are better helped by a curated list of tutorials and having people give them individualized help rather than a never-ending stream of tutorials covering the same topics.
How about write code that doesn't crash and doesn't need shitty 3rd party libs that fix the problem that doesn't even exist? If you handled exceptions properly you wouldn't need this, especially when most of the time retrying with wrong input isn't what you want to do.
A library is more than the sum of its imports.
If you actually want to remove alphanumeric characters from a string then surely "In the 1980s" would become ""? So what are you trying to do?
Ok. I'm sure you enjoy being negative, but leave me out of it.
Use getpass.getpass() to make the initial input invisible. 
Knowing what a programming language is doesn't make me negative. It just makes you look fucking stupid when people repeatedly tell you that and you still act like someone is against you because `&lt;insert conspiracy theory&gt;` and not because what you mentioned isn't a fucking programming language.
Gotta love the &gt;If you're resident in Belgium, you can participate :) After you already says that you're from NL. People like this...
Begone thot.
Great job knowing what a programming language is. [PostgreSQL 8.4+](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Cyclic_Tag_System) is Turing complete.
eh. angry programming is angry.
I do not know why, if we never stop learning, we can't also visit /r/learnpython to learn the things? A reason for no tutorials in /r/python is the tutorial spam, and a desire to come up with a rule, where a desireable rule is objective and not subjective. 
And that's fine/to be expected for /r/learnpython to remove most of the spam tutorial links too. A curated list makes more sense, though is usually too-slowly changing over time.
Great job not knowing that extensions of SQL aren't same as SQL. By that logic you could extend CSS to be turing complete and it would be a programming language, so could be your stupidity.
eh. stupid skid is stupid.
&gt; Oh! my IP has not been banned How funny! I've been eating apple seeds like there's no tomorrow, and I haven't died from cyanide poisoning yet.

My solution to the spam problem is to unsubscribe from large subs. The smaller that subscriber number in the sidebar, the less tempting it is to the spammers, the less spam gets posted. Few mods are willing to be aggressive enough to eliminate spamblogs.
Transcript? Any text?
The article contains the full text of the interview.
def function1 (a, g) a= size g = color def function2 (r) r = qty of shapes main () calls the function of function1 then validates to ensure that the size is at least lets say 10 if it checks out then it calls out the function2 to continue the process
Is the assignment to _come up with an idea_, or to _implement_ them? *If your assignment is to come up with an idea, you're missing the point. You can't ask people for their ideas and copy. Make your own idea. Don't engage in academic dishonesty. It makes everyone's piece of paper worth less. *If your assignment is to implement an idea then do the first one that comes to mind. A stock management application. Cool. There's lots of those out there already. Pretend one of them is a high-fidelity prototype. Make a list of core features, and implement them. 
Does https://help.github.com/articles/about-project-boards/ do what you want, except for the self-hosted bit?
Drinking, sorry.
IMO /r/learnpython should be aimed at beginner content while /r/python is news and late-intermediate to advanced content. Beginners are of course welcome here but the content should be able to assume a minimum level of Python proficiency. 
Funny :-)
No, implying that you don't have to write the code to do that yourself. That's what libraries are for.
It doesnt take up too much space..I would just leave it. Only if you have a lot of libraries, and you are using a bunch of them without some kind of `virtualenv` could this become a headache..
Thanks for the feedback. As you can tell I am extremely new at Python and am going through the early stages of things not making sense. I used function1 and function2 as I had not gotten to the naming convention yet. For the other comment, Ok so a user opens up this program. I need three inputs. (s) size (c) color (n) number of shapes When the program starts the user will be asked, what is the size of the shape you want? Then the program asks, how many of these shapes do you want? Since the program now asks if you want lets say 8 shapes, it will need to ask you, what size of the other shapes and the other colors of the 8 shapes. If the user inputs 2 shapes, it will draw two shapes. So this is where I know I need a loop which will take the input of the user. The inputs of the user must be defined in the main function. My apologies for not posting this in the correct forum. 
Is your project OpenSource? The advantage of GitHub is that there is a huge fan following behind it.. so its very likely to add new features and reduce bugs quickly for the next few years at least. Newer projects from startups might have more fancy features.. but you never know how long they last..
Surely it would become `" "`? 
&gt; We're also seeing a growing number of non-effort summarizing articles... Oh, like KDNuggets! That website with the shitty yellow theme.
I agree that python is missing something. But instead of this, why not just introduce a switch/case statement with fallthrough? It solves the problem you are trying to solve, on top of the "problem" of chaining a bunch of if/elif to see if what a variable is equal to.
r/learnpython and read the sidebar
Nowadays it's pretty hard to tell TBH
For someone who is completely ignorant to the topic. Are there any specific features that standout on Nutch? What kind of data are these serious scrapers collecting with it? I was pretty impressed with Scrapy, but that's because I don't know much about the scraping world.
Tags won't solve the problem. Basic tutorials need to be forbidden in the post rules and mods should hand out temporary and permanent bans for breaking them.
Two signs are a comparison: is X equal to Y, X==Y will give a true or false response. A single one is an assignment: make X equal 5, X=5. Also best to post these questions on r/learnpython :)
So it has to be an idea nobody else is doing? That's really hard.
No as long as someone in my class isnt doing it
Thank you so much!

That's not really a job for Python - it's probably possible, but that sounds more like a job for tcpdump or wireshark. Once you've got the packet(s) captured, then go ahead and process them in Python. On the other hand, there are a bunch of hits on a Google search for "Python packet capture", so other people have gone down this road. 
The video was created with Joytan, a PyQt5 desktop application, with a number of Python libraries such as pydub, PIL, moviepy etc. Let's take a break and listen to the relaxing audiobook. You can find the code here. https://github.com/kokimame/joytan
The problem with using tcpdump or wireshark is that I would like to be able to scan the network traffic live, not record it, save it, then search it.
When you say "add", do you mean mathematically add objects together that implement \_\_add\_\_ or \_\_radd\_\_ OR do you mean add values of common keys to a list at that key in the new dictionary?
anything is possible.
How about ngrep?
I'm trying to avoid using system commands to accomplish this task such as ngrep or tshark and stick strictly to parsing the network traffic using code, but if I must, as in there is no better way, sure.
That's true, based on the example given. I just wanted to make sure I understood correctly.
Exactly what information are you seeking? Your request seems quite broad, too broad to gain any useful insights.

No problem, good luck on your learning journey!
I’ve ran into similar problem but not pygame itself. Make sure you don’t have a file in the same directory named pygame.py. That would import your pygame.py instead of the package you downloaded. 
for key in dictionary; for key in other_dictionary: new_list.append(key) new_list.append(key) 
I'm not sure what you mean by default dictionary. Do have an example?
I forgot about that! thanks for reminding me!
I had them. You're welcome.
 result = dict(x.items()+y.items())
= sets the variable X= 3 or variablename = “a string, list, or other thing” == is to compare As in loops or other statements (while, if-elif-else) X == variablename ##——[not the same]——## I’m brand new at this too. 
You made a CMS *with* a CMS?
The ability to answer random questions would be a nice feature. My younger cousins back in Utah always ask Alexa questions like,"Why do tigers have stripes?" And it's really awesome to see how wowed they are by the response.
I'm not averse, but I think we'd need a more engaged moderation team to really make this work.
Without a defaultdict:- result = dict() for key in dic_a.keys(): result.setdefault(key, []).append(dic_a[key]) for key in dic_b.keys(): result.setdefault(key, []).append(dic_b[key]) I'll test the code later.
Are your dict values all numbers? Then: from collections import Counter new_d = dict(Counter(d1) + Counter(d2)) 
I just use Google maps directly. Python 2 but shouldn't need much for py3. https://github.com/Permafacture/pygmaps-ng Example (large flat html file but requires internet access): http://elliothallmark.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/austin_zoning.html
Hibernation does turn off your computer. It saves all RAM to disk and powers off the machine. On the next power-on, it restores RAM and tells devices to resume as best they can. As for Python, this highly depends on what OS, OS version, windowing system, virtual desktop system, and even apps, to support querying and adjusting their state.
What editor are you using? Because I'm afraid you're using something like notepad, or VIM without add-ons. Go find yourself a decent editor, maybe PyCharm, that'll check PEP8 for you and auto convert those pesky tabs to spaces. See if it helps 😜

Curious to look through it. As a note only to help capture interest, may be worth including screenshots of it in action in your README
Not sure what "slow" means here, as reading a file over the 'net is always slower than reading from the local filesystem. Maybe there is some sort of timeout value you could set to something like 1 second. A timeout may throw another exception, if you *can* set a timeout. Questions like this are better asked in /r/learnpython.
I'm using Sublime 3. Also I'll repeat again: I don't give a fuck whether you, cocksuckers of "professional "standards"" want me to put 2 spaces before putting inline comment or one, I'll put as many as I want and you can all fuck off if you don't like that.
FYI, since no one else has mentioned it yet, `d1.update(d2)` is equivalent to: for k, v in d2.items(): d1[k] = v
Thanks man! Yes that will definitely happen.

Not going to help someone who can't bother to ask their question properly. You haven't shown us your code, you haven't even bothered to say where exactly the error comes from.
As others have said, this is best handled by the operating system. There *might* be ways for a python program to reach into other running applications and read or change their state, but it's not obvious how to do that from another user program and it's not worth the time figuring out how to do it **and the risk** of crashing your computer.
I think this is the best approach. A standardized format to quickly gauge how useful a tutorial might be for a reader.

Damn you seem so angry, who hurt you?
I've enjoyed both Learn Python the Hard Way and Automate the Boring Stuff. I started with LPtHW, and the first half of the book really helped drive in the basics. The second half gets into more advanced stuff too with some good projects.
Why pass it a number? Is that a seed for a random function? Why not have it search new comments for a keyword like !coinflip and have it respond "Heads" or "Tails"?
If you're fairly new to programming, you might also enjoy [code club python projects](https://codeclubprojects.org/en-GB/python/) 
Must have typed the name in wrong. 
Good point. The number you send it is equal to the amount of times the coin was flipped, so if you send it 10 it will go through a loop 10 times, inside the loop a random number either 1 or 2 is generated, 1 is equal to heads 2 is equal to tails and then there are just if statements after that stating if heads is greater that tails heads win and so on. I want to be able to not just send heads wins or tails wins but send the data along too. Something like out of 10 flips it landed on heads 4 times and tails 6 times so tails is the winner. 
Nice work. But why is the video image so overloaded? This should be about zen not chaos and graphic design from the 90s. Also the bell between the the points is way to pearcing. Sounds like that sound from camshows.
Actually pygame has an [init function](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/pygame.html). They aren't trying to call a constructor.

Why do people keep using Python 2.7 for new things?
Thanks for sharing, it looks useful and overall I think you did a good job for a first python package. Some feedback: * should always use 3+ for new projects, unless you really cant avoid it. (your package doesn't appear to need it, as python-pptx is compatible with Python 3.4) * Well done using tests! Maybe include a more complex pptx file to check how it handles that? * typo in the comment in line 47 of conv_raw.py # retriwve * use git exclude to exclude backup files and build stuff from the repo. Normally its fine you just backup everything using git, but for a public package, make it clean as possible with only the stuff people need. (not sure if you need the .eggs and build folders as well?) You could also look at PEP8 formatting of comments to make it completely consistent. Nice work! 
You mean Wes McKinney's book? I haven't read the last edition, but it's a good book as well. It focuses mainly on pandas (he is the main author of that library), so that part is covered more in-depth than in Vanderplas' book. If you want a solid introduction into Python machine learning and scikit-learn, Vanderplas' book is still recommended. If I were you, I would download the notebooks https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook , and if you like it, you can still support the author and buy a copy of the book afterwards.
This is a really common problem in various subtle forms. Basically, your `if` test doesn't even come close to doing what you think it does. It will always evaluate to "true", because you have one single test (food=="taco"), and then a bunch of strings [0]. What you mean is `if (food == "taco" or food=="tacos" or food == "Taco" ...): `. There are a bunch of better ways of doiing that - the closest to what you have would be `if (food in ("taco", "Taco", "Tacos"...)):` and you could convert the input to lower case so you only have to test against lower case. [0] Here's an interesting thing. It might seem that the strings evaluate to true (and indeed they do), so a list of strings is true. But it's not quite that simple. Try these: if (True): ... if (False): ... if (True, False):. ... if (False, False): ... 
I think you are expected to add a pair. Like m[6]=5

Making a decent video about the world of zen may be far beyond my artistic ability. btw, I was just editing the last reply. This one is the video I put more effort into graphics and audio experience. If you don't mind, give me a feedback.
/r/learnpython is a great resources. Codecademy is decent, but teaches Python 2, which is outdated and you should really learn Python 3 instead. It's a fine language to learn first, better than most others.
Why Python and MongoDB specifically?
In regards to codecademy, do you still think it’s a good idea for me to learn the rest of my programming from there? I know that site gets a lot of mixed feelings from experienced programmers. 
Codecademy isn't enough to learn "the rest of your programming" - it'll give you some basics, but it's definitely not going to teach your _everything_, if such a thing is even possible at all.
You can try to use the [NetfilterQueue](https://byt3bl33d3r.github.io/using-nfqueue-with-python-the-right-way.html) module to pass some packet to an userspace program
You might want to look into [Pelican](https://blog.getpelican.com/) then - it doesn't use a database, but it does use Python.
It won't teach you to make apps with graphical interfaces, or websites.
/r/learnpython/wiki has lots of resources.
wait, so the complete answer is m[5]? 
It's the keyword unpacking syntax. So you're saying unpack those two dictionaries into `foo='bar'` style keyword arguments, but then wrap that in a new dictionary.

When people say they "know how to program", they may genuinely mean quite different things. This is similar to how people may say they "know how to write in English": in some context it may mean that they are proficient enough to make people who read English understand what they wrote (they may be making a ton of spelling and grammar mistakes for example). In a different context, it may mean that the speaker knows how the grammar and spelling work, that there are dictionaries etc. In yet another context, it may mean that the speaker considers herself a writer, as in someone who knows how to structure a novel, or to create a slogan for an ad campaign. It is not at all necessary that the writer know about grammar (although very common), just as the person who knows grammar rules well isn't necessary good at coming up with campaign slogans. Programming, in my view, can be a vocational, engineering and mathematical discipline. The vocational side involves knowing your tools, being aware of existence of libraries, frameworks. Understanding the domain in which the program is used. Engineering side is about creating those tools and libraries, working on designing new computers. Mathematical side of things is about analyzing how those tools and libraries will work in principle, what is the underlying theory of computers. The bootcamp-like places (Codeacademy being one such place) are targeting the vocational side of things. They are there to give you a profession that involves creating end-user products s.a. web sites, games, mobile phone apps etc. If you want the engineering side, then Codeacademy isn't for you: you need to go to college for CS / EE degree. And if you are into math, then, again, college, but math / theoretical CS.
Personally, I like it. I mean sure, the creator can just get their friend to post it as a recommendation, but at least it gives an idea to the community. And if the same person is recommending every article from a site, then its grounds for a ban. After that let the up/down votes decide its fate. 
Nope, one should definitely exclude them in your `.gitignore`. In fact, I’d suggest adding common editor backup file patterns to a global `~/.gitignore` in your home directory, and then do: git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore
Here's why it doesn't really make sense to have a C-like `switch` in Python: The advantage of `switch` in C is that it computes a small hash-table with jump addresses where the program needs to transfer control once a key from hash-table is selected. Hash-table is created at compile-time, so the linear time it takes to create a hash-table is not spent by the program at run time. In Python the construction of hash-table would have to happen at run-time, since Python simply doesn't have a place to store static data in the same way C program can do that. So, you'd spend linear time constructing hash-table and then constant time selecting a key from it... it's better to just write a bunch of `if...else`. As for repeated conditions, there's a strong argument against doing both your original problem and it extends to your suggested solution: you shouldn't test the same condition more than once, this is prone to error and complicates understanding. A textbook solution for this problem is to store state with the tested condition and use state-specific method to handle further conditions. Here's how it works: def test_two_conditions(a, b, c): if a and b: print('a and b are true') if a and c: print('a and c are true') Of course, in this case, it is easy to rewrite it as: def test_two_conditions(a, b, c): if a: if b: print('a and b are true') if c: print('a and c are true') But often times it's not so straight-forward (you need to place extra code that has to be executed unconditionally between two `if`s, or the conditions are more complex, in which case, the way to go is to do something like this: class TrueA: def do_if_b(self, b): if b: print('a and b are true') def do_if_c(self, c): if c: print('a and c are true') class FalseA: def do_if_b(self, b): pass def do_if_c(self, c): pass def a_factory(a): if a: return TrueA() return FalseA() def test_two_conditions(a, b, c): a_state = a_factory(a) a_state.do_if_b(b) a_state.do_if_c(c) This is certainly longer, but it allows you to split one complex function into a smaller, simpler parts. It's easier to test and to patch.
This looks interesting. Your screenshot does not show all of the code. Can you make another one that shows two longer lines? I don't have linkedlin account.
i really hate those things. instant thumbs down when i come across one. 
**We didn't think of the rise of multiprocessing and multithreading**
That has nothing to do with Python 3. The language can handle multithreading just fine, it's the Python reference implementation that can't.
I've been trying to wrap my head around this. I've read that Jython has no issue with multithreading so the problem isn't a pure-python problem. Is it correct to say that the problem is in the way CPython interfaces with c-extensions and pypy has a similar problem (but for different reasons?).
Try this one on Coursera, it's much better https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python
The problem is that the CPython runtime isn't built to be thread-safe. Therefore only one thread may execute Python code at any time within one process. Native machine code not calling the Python runtime can do what it wants, e.g. numerical C extensions can and often do use OpenMP internally. You *can* do multithreading in CPython, but the threads cannot run concurrently. Therefore this is only useful for I/O bounded tasks. I do not know enough about PyPy to know what the problem is there.
Multiple CPUs/cores on the same system weren't even on the horizon when Python was designed, and the few SMP architectures at the time were certainly not something you'd be using Python for.
Few languages are designed for parallel processing. C++ certainly isn't. You either use clunky compiler extensions like OpenMP for that or even clunkier manual system calls. Python's lack of concurrent multithreading support isn't an issue of language design, it's an issue of how the design is implemented in CPython.
When python 3 was designed? When python 0.9 was designed we already had multiprocessing systems. When Python 3 was designed we already had AMD multicore CPUs. Python 3 was still born because of changes to str-&gt; utf8+bytes and no proper in-design multiprocessing/multithreading support. Global lock should go.
I am actually one of the best coders in pythoon ever, just never learned graphic stuff
Well, at least you're confident in your abilities.
How much do you know about the GIL in CPython?
There are some language design issues to consider in a multi-threaded context, and they aren't exposed in python. For instance you would want certain basic operations. For instance one would naively expect that adding an entry to a dict should be atomic, but since the language is so amenable to hotpatching and dynamic typing that effectively means that an entire function call to setattr should be atomic... at which point you might as well just demand that all functions be atomic. So you really would need to introduce some new concepts and keywords to truly support multithreading safely. The alternative is to do it the C way and assume everything is unsafe and is not atomic, and then demand that the programmer puts locks everywhere. I honestly don't see that as being very pythonic, and to quote hettinger "there must be a better way". Now in practice the C style unsafe threading is what we have, but since nobody really uses threading it doesn't matter so much.
I am actually one of the best coders in pythoon ever, just never learned graphic stuff, I have been awarded with thousends of awards from my activity in the python community and I've created as many as 10 thousends softwares, which durning my 20 years of work, sold more than 166,000,000 copies in total. the industry of the python wouldn't be the sae without me 
I am new to Numpy and this is amazing! Your other tuts too!
Interested to hear what these are!
Hi, this looks nice. May I know if it supports like: `soup.find('div', {'attribute': 'value'})`?
I figured it be more fun if you could tell the bot the amount of times you want the coin flipped
I have always been interested in doing this to sift through SEC docs for toxic dilution and offerings.
You could have an optional GIL and an `@atomic` decorator which acquires that lock and doesn't release until the function is done. Obviously the implementation would be hard, but the interface for optionally atomic functions isn't impossible.
It can't be monkey patched, but as a programmer I am expected to treat things that claim to be dicts (and implement the interface) as dicts... to do otherwise introduces a bifurcated type model similar to Java's awful int vs Integer. I don't think we want to go down that road! 
`x, y, z = obj.x, obj.y, obj.z`? I don't think I understand the desired outcome. Is it necessary to declare variables? Are you able to instead operate off the object's values at the time they're needed for calculation? 
Thank you, for your comprehensive feedback. I recently found out the new convention on writing in python3, as for the other points I will make these adjustments.
That's really heavy handed though, and it's unlikely that library authors would wrap the correct functions. So then you have the best of both worlds: poor performance and bugs! I think we either have to make significant additions to the language in terms of keywords, concepts, and a more in your face memory model... or we just accept the crappy C model of saying that multithreaded programming is not for mere mortals and requires explicit locking.
I am trying to improve my python chops by writing/modifying a script a day. I consider myself a newbie, its been 6 days so far and I have been struggling with the feeling that I am "Running to stay in the same place" rather than getting somewhere. Ideas were hard to come by initially but I think I have a good idea of things I could do for at least the next 2ish weeks. Mainly doing this because I really really enjoy using something I made myself to do a task. And I think this would give me a good set of projects to pick from and expand later. I am also just an undergrad at university, and I feel like this is a good way to build up my portfolio/take a break from my classes. Never have gotten back any feedback on python code, feel free to take a look/comment-criticize it if you want, [here](https://github.com/div3/100DaysOfPythonScripts) it is. 
Python 3 has nothing to do with multithreading. CPython has been a continuous codebase since 1990 and the GIL is everywhere - it's a huge effort to remove it at this point and it might even be impossible without sacrificing single-thread performance. There was no reason to expect at that time that multiprocessing systems would be as common as they're today because most people just expected CPU frequencies to keep doubling.
Agreed, I was referring to design of CPython and not the language itself.
Yeah. Your whole post underlines what i said
Guido specifically mentioned cleaningUpTheOldNames.
yes that is correct. This is due to the reference python implementation using something called the GIL (Global Interpreter Lock) which is a mutex that protects access to Python objects, preventing multiple threads from executing python bytecode at one. It's necessary mainly because CPython's memory management is not thread safe (and due to its existence other features have also grown to depend on the guarantees the GIL enforces). Guido is all for replacing the GIL but there is a condition that must be met before the GIL is removed. It must not break C extensions (there are many people working on it currently but at the moment there is no solution which doesn't break C extensions) and it must not cause slowdown to single threaded applications. the GIL was brilliant at its time since most computers only had one core and could essentially one run one thing at a time. however since multi core processors came along it's sad to say but the GIL is a minor flaw in the design of the reference implementation (when it comes to multi-threading)
Hey, don't mind the downvote but would you be so kind to explain what you don't like about this?
You don't necessarily want adding to a hash table to be atomic and should not force it. Stockfish (the strongest chess engine) uses a non-threadsafe hash table by design since for them it's more important to be fast than 100% right.
But that's bullshit, amirite? All of us know that CPython is the only implementation which is consistent among platforms and supports all of the modules on pypi. In fact the backwards incompatibility introduced by py3 actually what made it a CPython alternative, because what's the point of porting your module which works perfectly in py2? All non-cpython implementations suffer from same issues unfortunately. Defaulting to python3 on the main page is what made everyone download it instead of py2 and putting time into it. However corporate won't ever switch. But that's not the point. Even now years later no work is put into proper multiprocessing and multithreading and Guido still stands by that decision. It's like there's a huge elephant in the room and he won't admit it. I don't need any more syntactic sugar. In fact I'm tired to invent new names because the dev team stole asyncdef and await from me (joke obviously).
Calling it an implementation detail is really downplaying it. 
That still displays the user in the input in the terminal which is what Im trying to stop. Tried getpass and it hasnt worked for me in that regard.
It's not like [people didn't try to tell him at the time](https://www.artima.com/forums/flat.jsp?forum=106&amp;thread=214112&amp;start=18&amp;msRange=15). TLDR: the importance of multiple cores was obvious, but C extension interoperability was deemed a higher priority. 
I'm sorry for the formatting, it did not work how I wanted
For those of us who don't want to watch the video, can we get the bullet points in here?
Obviously not. The other big thing would be fixing up map, filter, and reduce, either by removing them entirely in favor of iterators/generators/list comprehension, or by making them more useful a la Java 8's Streams
For me, the main reason to consider it is its functional features, whilst still being able to use all of Python's existing libraries. I've been meaning to do some stats/ML project in Haskell, but Coconut seems to be a nicer alternative. In particular, I really like the pipeline style and new lambdas. Not sure if this is a good example, but I just pulled out one of Tensorflow's MLP example, and rewrote it Coconut-style: cross_entropy = ( features |&gt; xs -&gt; (xs `tf.matmul` weights['hidden']) + biases['hidden'] |&gt; hs -&gt; (hs `tf.matmul` weights['output']) + biases['output'] |&gt; ls -&gt; tf.nn.softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits(labels=labels, logits=ls) |&gt; tf.reduce_mean ) So nothing terribly exciting, but I think I do prefer function composition with one-line scope than declaring many intermediate variables. Also, the currying and pattern-matching examples look great!
Not an issue. In fact, it might even be faster. Also, /r/learnpython.
Thanks to you!
Multiple CPUs in the 90s were definitely not uncommon in the workplace and were available at home even with Intel architectures though admittedly more rare. The Pentium Pro in fact officially supported multiple processors. There were technically dual processor 386 and 486s like the Compaq SystemPro. I personally have a dual processor Sun Sparc 5 and a quad processor Sun Ultra 60. I first used Python (v1.5/1.6) with this architecture since my college was based around it. The difference between then and now is single processors, even on SOCs, are so much more rare it seems ridiculous to optimize for it.
Print should be an interface.
Unlike C or C++ a dictionary is a core primitive object. As such we certainly need clear semantics as to what happens within a directive like `foo[x]=1` when there are multiple threads contending for access to `foo`. Python really doesn't bring those kinds of concerns forward. I don't know how the interpreter processes that, and I don't know how it might interact with other threads. Given that python actively encourages indirection (with decorators and duck typing) it is very hard to reason about how a python program will run in a multi-threaded environment. So it isn't that I have strong objections to `foo[x]=1` not being atomic, but if it isn't atomic I want to know what hell is actually going on there. And I don't think I can say that with any confidence.
 str(Print(‘hello world’)) It has a `__str__` method 
this to me is one of those minor linguistic additions that wipes out a whole class of awful 'helper' functions that have historically polluted so many codebases. quite nice.
Nice copypasta skid.
It may be because Button does some stuff you don't really want/need.. you can easily sidestep its visual representation and compose the behavior from Image, which can keep the aspect ratio from kivy.base import runTouchApp from kivy.lang import Builder runTouchApp(Builder.load_string(''' &lt;MyButton@ButtonBehavior+Image&gt;: source: self.state == 'down' and 'down.png' or 'up.png' MyButton: ''')) Typed out on mobile; not tested, but looks ok..

Looking at you, `logging`
Thanks to everybody who commented and checked out the code, I appreciate you guys sharing your insight.
The ones that come to mind, and these are entirely personal, are that I think there are a few weird behaviours in the async stuff and the types was canonised too early. I wouldn't want either removed, but some "We've learnt, and got a better idea of what we want" type re-work could be could. Basically I think they were both major features introduced at a time when the mindset wasn't cautious enough.
&gt; TLDR: the importance of using multiple cores was evident, but C extension interoperability was deemed a higher priority. To be fair, that wasn't necessarily wrong. Python does multithreading just fine as long as the additional threads are IO-bound and Node's success is fairly good proof that a large share of software being written today is not dependent on cpu-bound multithreading. For very large swaths of software, the main thing needed for "good enough" performance is simply to do IO in a way that doesn't block (as well as being able to do IO in parallel).
I would have liked an answer to: How do I need to write my python code today to make the transition to python 4 easier?
I would only recommend this book if you are at least a year or two into your Python journey or are coming in with a few years of experience in another language. I started reading it in November. Still at it. Taking the time to absorb concepts.

I thought GvR mentioned before that the hope is 3.9 --&gt; 4.0 and it won't be a breaking transition.
I have worked through a basic python course before, but mainly focused on the scripting side. This is a great dive into learning how to make useful web applications. The instructor's pacing is excellent. It moves at a pace fast enough to keep me interested, but he also goes into enough detail that I can back up the video and re-listen to any concepts I might have missed.

Ok, that kinda helps. It says row[0] but all my categories are in columns so would I just replace row[0] to column[0] ?
Exactly. Python isn't Smalltalk, why should we use Smalltalk's unit testing patterns? We have better patterns available.
I think anyone who wanted proper parallelism moved to the JVM or the CLR years ago.

You might need to roll your own for this one I don't know of any widely used blogging platforms that use Python and MongoDB. It should be straightforward with Flask though, there's even a [connector](https://flask-pymongo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) module between Flask and PyMongo.

Thank you, that's interesting. I am not really familiar with pipeline protocols (I do use a lot of lambdas) and I think that is why I couldn't see the use. Time to step up I guess,
its pretty widely used it could be a dependency for some other package you installed. Also, are you using a virtual env? You will want to properly isolate your environment from other envs.
i am not too sure? How do i know if I am, and how do I isolate it?
Although I wanted an already built scraper or crawler of some sort, I still appreciate your reply. This book seems nice to go through. Thanks.

The Talk Python course Python for Entrepreneurs will teach you everything you would want to know about using Pyramid to build a webapp. I know Flask gets a lot of love, but I've been super happy with Pyramid and this course was key a learning experience for me in being able to launch a couple of webapps. Definitely worth the money. https://training.talkpython.fm/courses/explore_entrepreneurs/python-for-entrepreneurs-build-and-launch-your-online-business
The + syntax is fine but it gets ugly fast if you’re adding more than one or two things. There’s a separate problem that Python builds strings in a loop inefficiently (it makes new memory entries for each partial string), so if you’re doing that, the best practice is to append the strings to a list and then do `final_string = "".join(my_list)` instead.

We should just add a stable version of pytest to the standard lib. Pytest is so nice. Me every time I test in python: "I *could* google how to use unittest again, or I can just make a `test_stuff.py` file, a `test_my_time` function, and call `pytest` from terminal"
I'm forced to use unittest because it's what we use at work. But having used pytest, I genuinely can't think of a single reason I'd want to use unittest over it.

Whaaaat? How did I miss that dictionaries are now ordered by default in the core? Also, how the hell is the performance the same?
Pytest is incredible. I shudder to think what black magic it's doing with the AST in the background but it does exactly what a testing framework should do.

Last week I built a couple of scripts with Python and a basic portfolio site with the usual front end (HTML,CSS,JS,Materialize). This week, I am beefing up my Django skills so I can feed the Python scripts output directly into the portfolio. Also, I am working on resolving Github issues for Conky. https://github.com/mswanson-me
Some linters follow the #noqa convention where you can add the #noqa to the end of a line and have the linter ignore that specific warning. If this is a few time thing, i would suggest doing that as it requires “less configuration”

As a beginner with python, I'd recommend you start with small projects ans extend them. Make sure you learn and practice everything, as python sometimes tend to get a bit complex, which makes it vulnerable to bugs and errors in the code, and although there are programs, such as checkmarx ans others, that might help with it, it might become a bit of a pain detecting those. Good luck.
Looks like it's automatically commenting. Can't read what it says though. 
My first introduction to programming was more than 10 years ago, but it didn't click for me until just a couple of weeks ago. For all those years, I think I felt that same "running in place" feeling. I understood the data types and functions and classes, but I didn't know what to do with that. My friends kept telling me things like "that's what's cool about programming... you can do anything!" But to me, that was too much freedom. What finally led to me making commits and contributing on projects was when I encountered an interesting problem that could be solved with Python and I knew enough that I decided to do that. I have also been studying the stock market and economies, and I wanted to make myself some tools to give me specific information based on the movement of the stock market for each day. Kinda vague, but there are some definite steps to take: retrieve stock market data daily, organize the data, chart the data. Right? Seems doable. I'm still working on it, but I've learned A LOT: *How to work with APIs *How to work with JSON data *How to organize my code logically for scalability *Libs:requests, io, json, ast, numpy, pandas Of course, I still have a lot to learn! I encourage you to keep going! Looks like you are a ManU fan, so you've got a ton to work with there. Maybe find some historical data for the club and work with it? Personally, datasets are what inspired me. :D Best of luck!

Text says something along the lines of: Sorry to bother you kind sir but would you please remove me from your digital message distribution list. On an additional note: the substance of your reports could use further improvement
It's probably unrelated. It's actually illegal to be unremovable from a mailing list, because anyone can put your addresses there. Something like Personal Digital Rights Act, or something, idk. I had to quote it once to get off of a Babtist mailing list after some online trolls though I could use Jesus in my life lol I got removed REAL quick when you start quoting laws.
Code that doesn't use `enumerate`. Could just read the data and then use `zip` and `len` to do the sums. Better yet use `pandas`, that's what it's designed for.

They don't have an API?
This is in pretty much alpha stage at the moment and is intended for Python 3.6+ only. The tool is capable of: check Check consistency download Download dependency packages freeze List all packages init Set up a new project install Install dependencies list List installed packages outdated Check for updates prune Remove extraneous packages run Run a virtualenv binary uninstall Remove packages why Figure out the dependency chain 
That majorly depends on your interest. If you have interest in numerical computing, one good project is to implement a neural network and train it for XOR function.

Of course. They're not gonna let some noob script spam comments _that_ easily. What he should have done is have it way an hour between comments, that way you leave it running overnight.
Ha ha very true
This a thousand times. A lot of the standard library is mess. 
awesome... giving this a try now.
Only because he didn't put in a delay. Having the script post a few, wait a while, then post a few more would likely be sophisticated enough to make it past their checks.
It came up as I was looking for alternative workflows. I'll be adding pipenv/Pipfile support soon!
Awesome. This works perfectly. Thanks! I thought from documentation that I was using the _post-0.8_ "best" way.

The first open source project I released made me feel like I was actually contributing something and it was amazing. I'm a medical student and I felt like this was even more helpful to the world than taking care of patients. A bit of a sick thought maybe, but the creative side of the creation of these projects just makes me feel great about what I'm doing.
No, but you can start a worker on some VPS and not use your own laptop for this. If the worker posted a comment per half an hour, it would be 336 comments per week, while OP could be enjoying life and using his laptop as usual. Source: did some IG automation through API.
&gt; C extension interoperability was deemed a higher priority For good reason. The C API is what makes Python useful to the sectors where it is actually popular and growing: science, engineering, machine learning, data mining, etc. Those are all fields where people, believe it or not, need to actually run native machine code written in C, C++, or even Fortran. The lack of multithreading is an annoyance, but it doesn't break anything because more often than not, these algorithms spend 99% of their time in two or three loops which are in C++ anyway. Not being able to easily feed that C++ code pointers to NumPy arrays *would* break things.
Yep, like any tool it's possible to abuse. When I've used it, I've given candidates 1 hour to do two problems I feel should take about 20 minutes combined. It seems to weed out ~20% of candidates. If you can't, eg, order a sentence by word frequency in an hour there's no way you'll pass the real interview.
That's due to the wonderfully named CAN-SPAM (Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography And Marketing) act.
Maybe. But I think every post being identical would also be a bit of a clue it was spamming.
C extensions work on virtually every Python implementation, including PyPy. You're missing the point [above](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/80lpda/guido_van_rossum_bdfl_python_3_retrospective/dux2pk4/).
This is definitely possible, albeit pretty complicated if you have no experience. Your best bet would be to use selenium to automate browser actions that log into your bank / check balance / pay bills / etc. I don’t know if banks have APIs that would allow you to directly interface with their payment systems so you probably can’t do this at a low level without selenium, which is basically just a macro. But also, most banks already have auto pay functionalities, just Incase you want to do this without python 
It is!!!
Zapier would be good for that if you wanted to set it up super easy and quick.

90's Jukebox Once your tests are passing for 10 - Classwork - Conditionals Review, copy your code here to start this lab. The goal is to change your code to fulfill the new jukebox requirements. We need to build a 90's theme juke box with the following songs, grouped by genre: rap: 1 : Dr. Dre., Still Dre 2 : Souls of Mischief, 93 'til Infinity 3 : Warren G, Regulate rock: 1 : Third Eye Blind, Semi-Charmed Life 2 : Oasis, Wonderwall First ask the user for a number of quarters with the prompt: Enter quarters: If the user enters anything less than one, print: Sorry, this costs money... If the user entered enough money, ask the user to pick a genre with the prompt: Genre: If they don't enter one of the genres above, print: Sorry, I don't listen to that stuff. If they pick one of our genres, play all of the songs in that genre, charging one quarter for each song until there is either no money left or they are no more songs left to play in that genre. For each of the songs played, print: Playing &lt;artist&gt;, &lt;song&gt;... where &lt;artist&gt;, &lt;song&gt; is formatted just like it is above in our song collection. If the user should receive change back, print the change in the format: Change: $&lt;change&gt; where &lt;change&gt; is the amount of money the user will receive in dollars. Print out Thank you for using the 90's jukebox! at the end of the program. Once you're done, press run tests to see if your program works successfully. Example Input / Output No money Enter quarters: 0 Sorry, this costs money... Thank you for using the 90's jukebox! Play all rap songs with no change left Enter quarters: 3 Genre: rap Playing Dr. Dre., Still Dre... Playing Souls of Mischief, 93 'til Infinity... Playing Warren G, Regulate... Thank you for using the 90's jukebox! Play all rock songs with no change left Enter quarters: 2 Genre: rock Playing Third Eye Blind, Semi-Charmed Life Playing Oasis, Wonderwall... Thank you for using the 90's jukebox! Play all rap songs with change left Enter quarters: 5 Genre: rap Playing Dr. Dre., Still Dre... Playing Souls of Mischief, 93 'til Infinity... Playing Warren G, Regulate... Change: $0.5 Thank you for using the 90's jukebox! Play all rock songs with change left Enter quarters: 5 Genre: rock Playing Third Eye Blind, Semi-Charmed Life Playing Oasis, Wonderwall... Change: $0.75 Thank you for using the 90's jukebox! Play one rap song for one quarter Enter quarters: 1 Genre: rap Playing Dr. Dre., Still Dre... Thank you for using the 90's jukebox! Play two rap songs for two quarters Enter quarters: 2 Genre: rap Playing Dr. Dre., Still Dre... Playing Souls of Mischief, 93 'til Infinity... Thank you for using the 90's jukebox! Play one rock song for one quarter Enter quarters: 1 Genre: rock Playing Third Eye Blind, Semi-Charmed Life Thank you for using the 90's jukebox! Play two rock songs for two quarters Enter quarters: 2 Genre: rock Playing Third Eye Blind, Semi-Charmed Life Playing Oasis, Wonderwall... Thank you for using the 90's jukebox! Play invalid genre Enter quarters: 1 Genre: techno Sorry, I don't listen to that stuff. Change: $0.25 Thank you for using the 90's jukebox! 
But won't this just help him since it'll appear he has more activity on his posts? Negative comments still count as views and that will only help his stats, right?
Here's my code: #90's Jukebox 2 option = input('Genre:') if option == 'rock': option_1_1 = int(input('Song number:')) if option_1_1 == 1: print(str(1) + ' : Playing Third Eye Blind, Semi-Charmed Life') elif option_1_1 == 2: print(str(2) + ' : Playing Oasis, WonderWall') else: print("No Entry") elif option == 'rap': option_2_1 = int(input('Song number:')) if option_2_1 == 1: print(str(1) + " : Playing Dr. Dre., Still Dre") elif option_2_1 == 2: print (str(2) + " : Playing Souls of Mischief, 93 'til Infinity") elif option_2_1 == 3: print(str(3) + " : Playing Warren G, Regulate") else: print("No Entry") else: print("Sorry, I don't listen to that stuff.") print("Thank you for using the 90's jukebox!") 
Use If statements to check the conditionals (as literal as that sounds, it’s a pretty straight forward request) and store your songs in a dictionary that have the appropriate attributes

But why are you converting at all? Regardless of how you’d like sets to behave, the statement if i in set(&lt;list&gt;): Is not something you should ever write. It will *always* be slower than if i in &lt;list&gt;: because you are allocating memory and performing hash operations, unless your interpreter is smart enough to skip the conversion. That’s not to say you can’t use a set as a longer-term cache, but you should only construct it once and store it off. Even then, it would only be effective if but that will only be effective if you are not updating (esp. removing from) the data very often and keep the cache consistent.

Well you're lucky. Using my current Gmail account, I subscribe to a number of very technical mailing lists and I've had to create a filter for each one to let messages bypass the spam filters. I was seeing WAY too many false positives. (and this is not DMARC related) As for my original Gmail account, one I've had since Gmail was still in beta, I can only use it for things I don't care about. It gets so much spam in the inbox you can't see legitimate messages. And a false positive in the spam folder, you'd never find it! 
Yeah, sorry. Entirely new to the sub. I can delete the post if needed. 
Why do you like it better? I'm currently using InstaPy

Deviant. I love it.
github.com/hardware/mailserver With this docker compose file, I get zero spam, moving to the spam folder trains the system that those messages are spam, moving them from the spam folder trains the system that they're ham. It also checks a ton of blacklists and whatnot without slowing down delivery too much. Also comes with web UIs and automates SPF/DKIM/DMARC and ARC. It can even automatically PGP encrypt mails. It's worth it.

I think my android phone does that. I've noticed that i can report things as spam or telemarketers after calls and it will say "Likely telemarketer" when it's ringing.
The real joke is in the username ; -)
I don't think that will work : (?P&lt;senses&gt;[A-z0-9 .]);? Note the ? is after the semi-colon! which won't match `Senses Perception + 2` You could add another group (including the semi-colon) match optionally: ((?P&lt;senses&gt;[A-z0-9 .]);)? You'd also have to change anything that used group *numbers* but since there are named groups it's probably safe.
I do occasionally spot check it, especially if I'm expecting something. I've never missed anything important.
definitely.
I almost always look through my spam messages before deleting them. The false positive rate really depends on how you use your email. There are a few addresses I consistently don't get my messages, regardless of how many times I've told google I want those emails. That said, it has a 99% success rate with me.
I've gotten "likely fraud" before...it was a legit sales call from Spectrum (well, as legit sales and Spectrum can be).
&gt; Is there a way I can pass an array to the decorator that contains a list of roles or permissions for each route individually? for example, [snip] so validate_user() can compare the user type to that list and accept or reject the request right there? What you're looking for is a function with a signature like `wrapper((Req -&gt; Resp, Permissions[]) -&gt; (Req -&gt; Resp)` and transforming it into a function like `wrapper(Permissions[]) -&gt; ((Req -&gt; Resp) -&gt; (Req -&gt; Resp))`. Here `(Req -&gt; Resp)` means a function that takes a request and returns a response and ` ((Req -&gt; Resp) -&gt; (Req -&gt; Resp))` is a function that takes a `(Req -&gt; Resp)` and returns a `(Req -&gt; Resp)`. There are several ways you can do this: * `functools.partial` * `toolz.curry` (this is a third party module) * manually curry * not doing it at all Someone else provided an example of the last one (not doing it at all), and if you're not already using `toolz` there's no point in installing it just to get their currying functionality. Of the two left, `functools.partial` is a bit cumbersome for this as it ends up being roughly similar to what I'd do, which is this: def validate_user(func=None, *, perms): if func is None: return lambda f: validate_user(f, perms) # same as before return decoratored_function This makes the function you're wanting to decorate an optional positional argument and your permissions a required keyword argument. If you're not using Python 3, then you can sub `perms=()` for `*, perms` and then they're an optional keyword argument. But the way this works is you'd do something like: class SomeView(MethodView): decorators = [validate_user(perms=['admin'])] And `validate_user` sees that it's received the `perms` argument but hasn't received the `func` argument so it returns a lambda that holds onto those perms in a closure and when it's provided the func, it'll actually invoke `validate_user`. There are other ways of doing this, but I think this is the most straight forward and the least amount of boiler plate. For example, this method has an extra level of indentation before even getting to your logic: def validate_user(perms): def _(func): @wraps(func) def decorated_func(*args, **kwargs): return func(*args, **kwargs) return decorated_func return _ And this one uses a class, which is a heavyweight and potentially dangerous solution: class ValidateUser: def __init__(self, perms): self.perms = perms def __call__(self, func): @wraps(func) def wrapper(*args, **kwargs): # do stuff with self.perms return func(*args, **kwargs) return wrapper Dangerous because if you don't know about descriptors and how they operate you can potentially screw yourself. In this case, it's actually perfectly safe even if you decorated the actual methods of the MethodView. However, if you accept the `func` in the `__init__` then things get real hairy real fast.
Omg that guy looks so douchey
It's fucking atrocious the minute you try to do anything complicated with it. Really good for simple stuff, though.
Thank you! 
I hate that guy's stupid YouTube ads. Nicely done.
I think just adding [;]* after the regular expression I gave him for Senses should do the trick. To be honest i am not sure what he needs his capturing groups to be though.
You’re doomed, give up. /s SysAdmin moving towards “DevOps” here. (Who has a degree in “Programming” from ages long past.) So take any professional programmer’s advice over mine. IMHO Python is a good start, by it’s important to learn the basics of programming logic and design. Procedural and Objective Oriented concepts are critical at first. They way, if you decide to move to a different language, you’ll have a solid foundation to work from. Try to solve specific problems at first; how do I post to you his wiki? How can I catalog my book collection? Make ugly code and don’t be afraid to iterate. Keep writing and playing... look for “small” projects on GitHub, get an editor/IDE that will tell at you for making mistakes. Remember, there is no genius without love and dedication. Nothing is effortless.
what is this "delete" of which you speak? I just stopped deleting anything years ago
`Senses ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; ?` But you're right, we don't know the actual requirements.
Only by 1.
Mine says "scam likely".
thanks, how about: `soup.find('div', text=re.compile(r'TEXT'))`?
I use an O365 account where I implemented a host of automations specifically for marketing emails, spam and mailing lists. These jobs run on a Linux server 24x7 to ensure that such emails never see the light of day. Now every time my phone's LED blinks I know it's an email worth reading. 
&gt; I've gotten "likely fraud" before...it was a sales call from Spectrum The system works!
Sounds like great advice! Thanks, I was about to just give up since I was doomed. I already have a degree in Network Administration. But Really got tired of the field and wanted to change it up. I think it started because I wanted to write some apps for my nieces but had no idea how. So now I want to learn, and I get a huge 75% discount from my university so I figured I may as well take advantage of it.
Or make multiple accounts and simply use a VPN to hide yourself. Not all VPNs have APIs to work with but PyAutoGui is useful when you need to REALLY hack something together.
Could you provide the code?
Yes im also trying to access the nan indices.. and yeah "imputated" its like changing the nan value to the knearest neighbor
I spot check the spam folder to make sure there are no false positives, then hit the empty button so i don't waste my time spot checking already checked mail. I usually wait until there's &gt;1000 messages in spam to do it, so it takes a few weeks each cycle. I never find anything misplaced, but I still can't stop looking, just in case.
I think I remember doing something like this back in visual basics day when I was in jr High 2 decades ago. Trying to find what breaks it and why it causes it not to work. I have tried watching youtube videos, but most of them go by the content so quickly its difficult to keep up. 
Indices cannot be nan. x[nan] is undefined. x[0] can be nan. If that's not what you meant, again, can you provide an example, because as I said x[0] is defined.
Could the better way be software transactional memory?
I don't think videos are the best place to start. There are good ones for specific topics, but try skimming the wiki links in the sidebar, some of which are text tutorials. Also, since nobody mentioned it yet, beware, python2 and python3 have some incompatible syntax issues, so you have to know the version of the tutorial you're using (you should just use 3). For example, they changed the print function, so even Hello World breaks in old tutorials...
Now randomize the delay from between 30 and 60 minutes, subscribe to a free VPN service like tunnelbear, install an openvpn client on the VPS and have the script cycle through connections to various VPN servers in other countries randomly every 5-10 comments and I can almost guarantee they will evade spam filters unless the VPN endpoints are known to IG.
Yes, you are. It's too late.
Can you post a tutorial on how you scripted that?
I initially took it as an off hand joke, but then I heard people laughing in the background and that immediately made me think of Zed.
You're not wrong, I think I misread your opinion before. But it's probably one of these things where there's never a good time and then you accumulate so much technical debt it becomes infeasible.
We arguably have that already with dict vs UserDict and all that.
Have a look at this twitter thread on programmers who started in 30s, 40s, 50s :) https://twitter.com/ossia/status/949421989126602752?s=19
I could program it to say error or something if you would not put the right number.
Thanks!
maybe pick 2 from `['I WISH TO UNSUBSCRIBE', 'I HATE YOUR CONTENT', 'THIS IS FAKE TRASH', 'UNSUB ME NOW']` or something. 
And add markov chain on top of that, which was fed data of their own comments so every comment is different and has real sentences that almost make sense, and boom, it's not spam.
&gt;Tried every possible way. Forgot to try "mark as spam" which ensures that you will never see it in your life again.
Just dont. Just use miniconda3
You are not quite supposed to use the `http` server directly inside uWSGI. Try add a nginx as reverse proxy with `socket` using uwsgi binary protocol.
How do you use getpass, and what is your environment? The code below do in fact get an input without showing it in the console. I think your problem is that you have some weird terminal settings. secret = getpass.getpass('Enter the secret value:') 
Would be a lot easier to help if you indentet your code :/
You must be bored. Why not just auto-delete? But if you're going through 5 minutes of effort anyway, it'd be more effective to report CAN-SPAM violation for his whole domain.
sorry here is a cleaner version def main(): quizzes() def quizzes(): print("Homework:") weight = int(input("Weight(0-100): ")) totalE = int(input("Total points earned? " )) totalP = int(input(("Total points possilbe? " )) print("Total points = " + str(totalE)) + "/" + str(totalP)) print("Weighted score = " + str((totalE) * weight) /100) + "/" str(weight)) main()
Interesting. Could you add some more documentation? I guess it is supposed to work like npm but i am not sure.
Hi, what error? 
Remove the local declarations of subfile and subroot inside your function. They shadow the lists you pass into the function.
The autogenerated CLI help is extensive - just add --help to any command. I'll add this info to the website in the future too.
i just get a syntax error and dont know why 
Also turn `subroot = subroot.append(i)` into just `subroot.append(i)`. `.append()` just returns `None` and modifies the list in place, it doesn't return it. 
 totalP = int(input(("Total points possilbe? " ))) # missing one paranthesis at the end print("Total points = " + str(totalE) + "/" + str(totalP)) # Missing one paranthesis on the end, and one too many on "string(totalE)" print("Weighted score = " + str((totalE * weight) /100) + "/" + str(weight)) #removed parenthesis after "totalE, added plus sign before "str(weight)"
Do any banks still support logging in with only a username and password?
You know how to read, right? Read the fucking sidebar. Then post in the correct subreddit for this shit. Then read THAT sidebar. No, read their sidebar before you fucking post. Pay special attention to the part about "we won't do your homework for you".
I know how to do 3d graphics , I am a expert I made the dancing camel animation 
Well, my point was that I'd like the benefit of sets (eg. quick membership check) and the benefit of lists (esp. orderedness). So I would rather not do the conversion currently, you're right, and in practice probably would to the conversion upfront. But still, then I'd have to consider upfront if losing the orderedness would be a greater loss than losing quick lookup. With ordered sets, this consideration would in many places be unnecessary, or at least much, the negative consequence of choosing sets over lists would be lower.
[Pipenv](https://docs.pipenv.org/) is the answer to pretty much all of your questions.
If you mean having a different virtualenvs in the parent folder, grip will ignore it. True venv nesting/inheritance is not yet possible AFAIK.
I’d love to see the source code you have a public repo? Thanks. 
I feel like Microsoft do the exact opposite of what they should be. 90% of my focused inbox is spam, and anything that I actually want to look at is relegated to my normal inbox which requires more effort to actually view.
I love this sub.
pip does not need sudo to be installed first time, isn't it dangerous to use sudo?
The API docs should include the rate limit
It is, running pip as root with sudo is in 99% of all cases a super bad idea for security and system maintenance reasons. To install a Python package globally on a Linux system you should _only_ be using the package manager with the repository packages to avoid fucking up your system beyond repair. For everything else, use a virtual environment.
I wish it was your opinion, but it's true. Because you can just write browser extension for pretty much anything you'd ever want to do on your browser automatically.
Microsoft email programmer: “Tim you flipped the mailbox names in the code you idiot.” 🤣 Only logical explanation or they hate everyone.
pip does need sudo if you're installing it globally for the first time on Linux
 They shut their API access down https://www.instagram.com/developer/authorization/
Thanks Julien. Wishing you all good luck!!!
Do not install globally! Ever. It's a really bad idea.

“The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is now.” – Chinese Proverb I'm 33 as well, but started programming professionally about 12-13 years ago. I think the most important thing to understand is that programming is a tool to solve a problem. The specific language is not important, especially not when just starting out. You are learning to program more than learning to write Python. Python is a fine tool to learn Programming. When you know how to program you can pick up a new language fairly quick so don't stress whether or not this specific programming language is the right one to learn. You don't have to choose you can have them all. There is no reason to wait until the course starts. Just go write some ugly code from a tutorial. Put code together and see what happens. Familiarize yourself with your tools by playing around with it. You will not be writing production ready code for a long time anyway so just have fun with it. Show your code to people and take all the advice and critic you can get. Take pride in your code but accept that its ugly and badly written. Every time you learn from a mistake you get 10x better than if you are just told the right answer. As times goes on and you keep coding you start write better code and start criticizing other people's code and asking why did they do X instead of Y. And now you have the tools to find the answer. You have now learned to program. You still suck, but: “Dude, suckin’ at something is the first step to being sorta good at something.” ― Jake the Dog
Not everyone, just the senders that don't pay them to be in focused inbox :)

It's a bit shit how you have to manage a virtual env and pip separately. There are other projects to combine the two, for example [Kenneth Reitz's Pipenv]( https://www.kennethreitz.org/essays/announcing-pipenv)
The GIL technically doesn’t even prevent multi*threading* from being used. There’s an entire module for that in fact. What it prevents is simultaneous execution of the Python runtime in more than one of those threads at any given moment.
Maybe I am missing something, but I get uncomfortable looking at all those field you need to fill out to register for this quiz. I think I'll pass.

This is much more a job for /r/learnpython, but you seem to not understand what's called "passing by reference" and "function returns", as in the general programming concepts, they're not python specific. What you're doing at the moment is declaring "global variables" called subfolder and subfile &gt;&gt;&gt; a=1 &gt;&gt;&gt; b=2 &gt;&gt;&gt; print(a,b) 1 2 and a function called ls that takes those two arguments &gt;&gt;&gt; def c(a, b): ... a=3 ... b=4 ... print(a,b) ... then calling a function (ls) and passing in references to those two global lists. &gt;&gt;&gt; c(5,6) 3 4 the first two lines of your function then dispose of the references that were passed in and replace them with new, blank, lists. &gt;&gt;&gt; print(a,b) 1 2 &gt;&gt;&gt; c(5,6) 3 4 &gt;&gt;&gt; print(a,b) 1 2 &gt;&gt;&gt; Notice how here when I first print a, b you get the global values (1, 2), then I call c with a=5, b=6 and it prints the local a, b within the function c, (3, 4) So you need to look up [return](https://docs.python.org/3.6/reference/simple_stmts.html#return) and you need to use different variables, so here's your current code simplified: &gt;&gt;&gt; a=1 &gt;&gt;&gt; b=2 &gt;&gt;&gt; def c(a, b): ... a=3 ... b=4 ... print(a,b) ... &gt;&gt;&gt; print(a,b) 1 2 &gt;&gt;&gt; c(5,6) 3 4 &gt;&gt;&gt; print(a,b) 1 2 &gt;&gt;&gt; and here's roughly what you intend to do &gt;&gt;&gt; a=1 &gt;&gt;&gt; b=2 &gt;&gt;&gt; def d(e,f): ... e+=1 ... f+=2 ... return e,f ... &gt;&gt;&gt; g,h = d(a,b) &gt;&gt;&gt; print(g,h) 2 4 &gt;&gt;&gt; 
Fun fact: recent versions of boost::test provide a BOOST_TEST(expression) macro which provides like 90% of usual functionality you get from py.test assertion rewriting using template magic. Shudder about _that_.

this. - pip install pipenv - pip install virtualenv - pipenv --python &lt;your-desired version eg 3.6&gt; [if you have multiple installed, so to be explicit] - pipenv install &lt;package&gt; - pipenv run python &lt;program.py&gt; [to execute under your virt env] - source $(pipenv --venv)/bin/activate [to work solely in your virtual env]
`pipenv shell` is a better option for that last one :P
If you're not afraid of the internet police, you can fill them with fake information.
right! but I got this problem once getting a message "Shell for UNKNOWN_VIRTUAL_ENVIRONMENT already activated." And after that it got a habit to source the venv. 
\^\^
Last question is incorrect
&gt; my android phone does that. I've noticed that i can report things as spam or telemarketers after calls and it will say "Likely telemarketer" when it's ringing. What app and/or exact model of phone are you using. I will throw my iphone in a fucking dumpster and go back to the dark side immediately. I need this in my life. Pls help.
Lol, I was thrown for a loop by the very first question which asked what condition would make a program run without error, because I knew that `while ...:` is valid Python and thought that conditions are actually preconditions. In much wisdom is much grief, and he who increases knowledge increases sorrow! Also, some other similar question (about a fractal) had the correct answer already inserted apparently, which was actually more confusing than helpful. Also, I hope that after it ends there would be an opportunity to do it again without a time limit.
It is random order so can you be more specific plz? :)
Is there a human readable version of this?
I don't want to talk to anybody anyway. Only strangers on reddit.
The one where you mutate a list thats a default arg, result should be [10, 10]

Hey guys, please if you think that a question may be not correct, please send it to us directly. EDITx IT'ers are definitely not experts in Python but they will forward it to the right jury members...info@editx.eu
Thank you! 
The creator had a great talk about the project on Talk Python to Me podcast
FYI It worked when I viewed on my laptop browser, but not on my mobile browser.
Indeed, I just asked, there will be the possibility to do it again without time limit and to get the details of each question and answer privately...
Thank you all!
Four spaces in front of each line to format code. In RES you can just highlight and click the "code" button.
Interesting, gonna check it on my PC later :)
I know you already have your answer, but a syntax error also gives a line number and where it occurs exactly. It is very helpful to read that, and if you ask a question, to share it.

The abuse in this case, is raising Exception, and using a naked except. This could be much safer with a custom exception.
Python2 had about a decade head start to build an entrenched base of legacy code, especially at places like RedHat, which are notoriously slow to change. A more fair measure would be: how many new projects are you seeing that don't support Python3? Not only is that number vanishingly small for most of the popular ones I've seen lately (as in, 0), projects are starting to drop Python 2 entirely: Django is going Python3-only, and I'm pretty sure I heard the SciPy stack is headed that way. If Python3 had been stillborn, none of that would be happening.
Yes, python is best place to start, especially when you want to get things done (without having all degrees possible in CS, literally) and not learn how computers essentially work and only then write something, if you were to start in any low level language.
GvR stated in the video, he's been working at Drop Box for 5 years, they're still on Python2!!! This will forever be a monument to indeed how difficult it was/is for shops to migrate from 2 to 3. The talk points out a lot of the compatibility layers were bolted on to 3 as an after thought because they didn't anticipate the level of problems they were going to cause with 3rd party libs.
Comments and DM spam is harder with IG now, you need a lot of comments and you need to spin them through syntax and comment structure.
You won't be allowed to login from multiple different IP's on Insta anymore. You'll get account locked after the second one.
After about a day or two, Insta will notice the comments are all similar and will block you.
You were right. The jury member didn't put the right code for this question. Thank you for notifying !
This has been a big help, I figured out one of my other regex issues using this tool. Thanks for this, currently trying to bash my way through this problem. 
I wouldn't look at anywhere else than PyInstaller. The other freezers are generally too much of a hassle.

No no no. It's, "Ah doo decleah!"
Read the sidebar; it holds the answer to your question.

Is it possible to learn this power?
Well let me put in another way. It's not a spam, as long as author gives us some context, some description, some affiliation note. If it's just a link, then it could be anything and to judge by the content one needs to actually go through it. So in the next tutorial you want to share (which I encourage you to do), I would suggest to elaborate a bit more. Did you write it during learning (feedback)? Or have you been putting down knowledge you have gained through the time from multiple sources (recommend)? Does it cover new unmapped python territories (recommend/discussion)? Do you want input from redditors (feedback/discussion). Is it just your personal notes you want to share (feedback)?
Reply once. Most mailinglist software will ignore an empty mail. But Google will never mark spam a source that you have written to. 
I'm going through my previous entries to a coding problems website and rewriting/redoing some of the work in a clean way, factoring out functions for future use, and writing docstrings and comments documenting my work in a nice, clean jupyter notebook. I should also mention that I was shamed into doing this after seeing Peter Norvig's exquisite github. 
Correct. I don't hate the GIL at all. I do very complicated 3D GUI applications that are slightly slower than they could be without the GIL, but mehh...it's Python, so who cares? Still, for certain applications, it would make a huge difference.
I have never heard of anyone using mod_wsgi. Most folks I know use nginx+gunicorn. Gunicorn has support for auto reload. However, ideally, you should just restart the application. This kinda gets into DevOps land, and swapping containers/AMIs. Also, the number of developers shouldn’t matter. Developers shouldn’t be remoting into machines. Your build system should be doing all of that for you.

Not just difficulty in my opinion, it's also just the the lack of incentive to upgrade in a lot of cases. Only now that the deadline is approaching people are thinking about upgrading.
This is only happening because the psf is forcing it, and it’s only working because while they burned a ton of folks like me who have all but abandoned the language (I would honestly never recommend python for new projects at this point, too risky no matter what GvR says) python randomly became hot as a teaching and data science language. Had that not happened either the psf would have abandoned py3, or more likely it would have died, become as niche as something like perl.
Fairly basic program but one I will find very useful, as I often like to change my desktop background to one of my most recently taken photos. This attempts all names beginning with '_DSC0' and then every 3 digit number on the end AKA '_DSC0000' all the way to '_DSC0999'. This means i can drag and drop the photo onto my desktop and it will find it without renaming straight from the camera
CODE: #desktop background import ctypes from itertools import combinations_with_replacement alphabet = ["0","1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8","9","_","a","b","c","d","e","f","g","h","i","j","k","l","m","n","o","p","q","r","s","t","u","v","w","x","y","z"] temp = "" for i in alphabet: try: temp += i.upper() except: None for i in temp: alphabet.append(i) for i in range(1000): #tries common nikon file names (e.g. '_DSC0001.jpg' name = "_DSC0" + str(i) #tries every combinations from '_DSC0000' to '_DSC0999' name = "C:/Users/Rory.BJ-PC.000/Desktop/" + name + ".jpg" #adds the location ctypes.windll.user32.SystemParametersInfoW(20, 0, name , 0) #sets background
sololearn is a great intro from there you'll have to start defining what you want to do with python before continuing your education once you've done that there endless free resources (like the aforementioned r/learnpython as well as endless free pdfs of textbooks online) as well as paid online courses such as the ones on Udemy which I recommend. Udemy has sales pretty often and they're dramatic so I recommend waiting for a sale as far as that goes. Good luck, and try to program every day
I've tried it... it is promising, but I had to go to gitter and ask how to run the basic repo. Paraphrasing a bit: "Use the beta repo in this branch to run xyz. Also prepare for breaking changes soon." My natural response to that is delete and look for alternatives. There is sooooo much churn on these *pybee* packages that make them really hard to recommend. BTW - dig the username.
&gt; Most folks I know use nginx+gunicorn. Gunicorn has support for auto reload. That's really good to know. I guess I made the mistake of assuming mod_wsgi was the best direction to go because it's recommended by the django install documentation. &gt; Developers shouldn’t be remoting into machines... Which is one of the reasons why this aspect of mod_wsgi is so frustrating. I'm definitely going to have to do some more DevOps research. Thanks!
I just finished the main part of my first python project - a random character generator for Dungeons and Dragons. I know there are more steps I could do with it and I could certainly condense the 90 data files I created and used for it, but for now it works and I'm happy with it! An example of the output: Race: Tiefling Class: School of Illusion Wizard Background: Soldier Raw Stat Rolls: [12, 10, 17, 8, 15, 8] Racial Bonuses: STR: 0 , DEX: 0 , CON: 0 , INT: 1 , WIS: 0 , CHA: 2 Stats With Bonuses: STR: 12 DEX: 10 CON: 17 INT: 9 WIS: 15 CHA: 10 No Extra Stat Choices [Github Link](https://github.com/RoseArtemis/CharacterGenerator/)

It's not a great book, it implicitly makes assumptions about how computers work, which aren't generally true. It prefers imperative languages over functional / logical, so, for example, you won't find help there, if you need to implement a heap w/o mutability. But, there are 80-90% of all CS grads, who read this book, so, if you are going to a job interview, it will provide you with the common language with your interviewer. If you work with a single single-threader computer, in something like C or Python, it may provide you with decent recipes for variety of problems.
Beautiful. Well done!
Hey, thanks for reading. I used LXCs and Ansible back in 2013 for setting up a dev environment for various projects. It's definitely a nice step up from using VMs in terms of efficiency, but from what I've experienced, Docker beats in every category that matters to me (ease of use, spin up / down speed, etc.).
How about having it show your recently taken shots and letting you pick from them instead? 
But you don't actually need to simulate it since it doesn't change the outcome whether you flip it 1 time or 1 million times. You can still provide the option though just don't do the calculation.
That’s a nice idea I might try it out, although the main reason for this program being so limited is that I want it to be quick so I don’t want to have to open IDLE and then run through the shell 
On somewhat similar note dfsch implements tail calls by essentially throwing C-level exception (the VM contains somewhat ugly C macrology that implements exception handling in C in a way that is somewhat similar to WinAPI's exceptions, this is then used to implement TCO, tagbody and condition system). The implementation is arguably ugly, but the end result is that anything that you can do in scheme code you can also do in C native functions.
My iPhone does this (flags numbers as Scam Likely). My previous Android phone did it as well (OnePlus)... I think it has more to do with how comprehensive the spam number database is than the phone model.
&gt; Having to tell the server every time the code changes seems clunky As opposed to what?
I use Mr. Number on my android phone for that. If enough people mark a number as spam, it will automatically block the incoming phone call from that number.

Knowing C/C++ might help you but it is not necessary. Furthermore, C and C++ are a lot more complex then Python, which makes them a lot more vulnerable to bugs and errors, that are very hard to be detected unless you use some programs, as checkmarx. So I wouldn't recommend on learning them before learning Python. Good luck.

It is very much Python's task if other developers don't provide the tools necessary for proper development. Electron is now being developed by GitHub community. When community doesn't do it, the companies/foundations themselves do it. Like Windows installer for windows and similar tech for Ios. Why wouldn't Python Foundation not do that, especially when doing that will lead to much wider adoption?
test.py The most dangerous .py there is.
"Batteries included" philosophy.
Love this idea. Are they just random functions from github?
This is a cool little hack. What it does it go up the call stack to figure out what variables were available to the calling context. It has some minor scoping issues with inner functions. If a variable declared in an outer function isn't used inside the inner function, it isn't in its locals so the `nonlocal` keyword has to be used in order for it to be available. It's also probably limited to CPython because of frame inspection.
Can't you right click and set as background directly?
[OpenDSA](https://opendsa-server.cs.vt.edu/) is my resource of choice
As you are part of the Python community I look forward to seeing you do the work needed to make this happen. It is certainly **NOT** part of the core developers remit.
Are you seriously suggesting that the 100,000 entries in pypi are part of the "batteries included" philosophy or what? Why PyQt, what about wxPython, possibly others?
https://docs.python.org/3/library/inspect.html#the-interpreter-stack The `del` is there to prevent cycles in the frame references. CPython uses a reference count for garbage collection, and cycles prevent the reference count from getting to 0. Python does have a cycle detector, but using `del` here is an easy and fast way of getting rid of the potential cycles.
oh you’re right ;-;
I know I should read this and actually understand the matplotlib API. But we all know the next time I need to use matplotlib, I'm just going to hack together the bare minimum viable solution using Stack Overflow.
As far as I know this doesn't increase memory usage because the interpreter is already keeping tabs on the frames and call stack. The only thing that would use memory is the ChainMap, but it's a lot more efficient that creating a new dictionary and updating it with the locals and globals.
Most Python devs are simply not QT users. A great deal of Python developers are unpaid contributors and are free to work on things they consider important. You yourself are also free to work on your pet peeves like the installer that you want and you can actually make a difference. I'm sure the QT community will gladly mentor you and eventually accept your pull request.
I would have if electron/JS option wasn't available. Its easier for me to switch to JS and develop Electron apps. The end users don't care about what language you use, they need an setup file which they can use to install a program. If a language doesn't provide an easy way to do that, its a big flaw. There are different instructions for creating an executable PyQt app in Mac and Windows(Mac is much harder) and web is littered with unanswered questions about deployment issues. 
Hi, The website looks good. Can't comment much on the code myself. One thing though, why are there two static files folder? The images you have used look pretty clean. Did you design them yourself or is there any source where one can find these?
I still appreciate it none the less. 
You need PyQt to develop an user interface to your script so that non developers/non tech folks can use it. You mean to say you never distributed your code to other end users? What kind of solutions have been developing so far on python if you have never interacted with end users? The main use of any program is to provide a business solution. I don't know how you can do that without having a proper mechanism to develop a setup distributable for a GUI Program.
r/learnprogramming might be better for posting it. Good job!
Paging u/mikeckennedy 
Emacs is my goto editor for almost any language. It has a very robust python environment. And a pipenv module was just announced. There are many good configuration examples that can be found by a simple Google.
I'm only upgrading because Ubuntu and Fedora ship Python3 support out of the box. Deadline had nothing to do with it for me, which is the case I've been making for the last couple of years to tons of down voting. When RHEL ships it in the stable repo, that's when Python3 will be universally switched to, IMO. My point was, the python reddit community loved to hate Python3 deniers like myself (aka realists), and now we have GvR himself saying he hadn't even switched his own employer over successfully.
&gt; his is only happening because the psf is forcing it, and it’s only working because while they burned a ton of folks like me who have all but abandoned t I was never a fan of the switch, but I never thought it was a big enough deal to not use python as long as you could ignore the python3 fanatics. I do agree that it cost the greater python community some mindshare. All the libraries were available for python 2, but everyone was shouting to use python 3, which probably confused a lot of new comers.
Perhaps it would be more elegant to fetch the present files and go through them, looking for _DSC rather than blindly asking for 1000 files that don't exist. Just a suggestion :)
Oh I still have million line python2 code bases I support, I just can’t in good faith support creating new projects in python given how the transition was handled and the imminent cessation of py2 support.
I see, this makes sense! Thank ya
Yet another useless, spammy, link-obfuscated referral pipeline. Do not click.
Would you prefer just «SyntaxError: invalid syntax»?
grrr it worked just fine in python2
Any suggestions on where to learn to package and publish to PyPI?
PyCharm is be far the easiest. VSCode is nice, but requires setup, where as PyCharm just seems to work.
Without singling out a particular library, the whole of packaging and deployment is a bit of a mess. It's got a lot better recently but it does lag behind some other languages especially when it comes to deploying to non-technical end users i.e. regular desktop apps.
This is great stuff! Definitely the inspiration I need. 
Definitely a good sound advice! I'll check out the side bar and see what I can find for online exercises and resources/books are available. I know I have a few PDF downloaded.
No you don't, there are plenty of other UI toolkits. And not everyone builds desktop software for Windows. There's tons of us working in web development, data science etc. I haven't faced this problem personally in the last 15 years.
How are you fairing now? Was it a great choice?
Awesome, this is very true and makes a lot of sense. I just come from a sense of martial arts. Sometimes you can learn a martial art at age 35 but you won't be great at it like those who started at 25. 
Dang.
I have script which FTPs the files to the server then "touches" wsgi.py. Works fine
Agree I know somewhat how a computer works, thanks to my degree and various certs I decided to pick up. But I feel like Python seems very popular and common each time I talk to my friends who are into programming. Most of them also know the C+ language but Python always comes up as #2 as their favorite.
You don't HAVE to use Python 3 if you don't want to. Just budget for support for after 2020.
I think that'll mostly be built-in modules and examples rather than the interpreter itself.
Black box a &gt; modified version of CORS algorithm with space rescaling 
https://snarky.ca/why-print-became-a-function-in-python-3/
I meant that it's high level language and simple enough for anyone to pick up, works both for OOP and procedural programming, so, especially beginners, don't need to deal with the OOP bullshit while learning the syntax and trivial things such as if statements, for loops and so on, nothing bad. And yes, it is popular, it's mostly used as a "project" language where it's not the result of the project itself but is used for automation of specific tasks and sometimes even prototypes, e.g. neural networks, often times it's just straight up used for them until it needs to be deployed, where production code is written in C++ for example. I wrote my own deep neural network in ~200 lines (this includes all the matrix math, IO to files for all the data reading, NN saving, NN training, NN using...), I don't know how many that would have been in C++... 
Understandable, but tell your legal team that pytest is [MIT licensed](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/license.html), which means they're almost certainly vetted that license as being compatible with your proprietary work.
I'm retired now and comfortable. My degree was pre-Python. Pascal, C and Lisp is what we learned with. Would have killed for Python. Good choice - not great. I graduated with a solid theoretical grounding but almost zero practical knowledge. 
fstrings are indeed the fastest way of concatenating strings. For example, `f'{a}'` is measurably faster than `str(a)` for converting `a` to a string, because it avoids the function-call overhead that comes with str(). So yeah, the only real drawback to fstrings is backward-incompatibility, but on the other end a major drawback to plus-sign concatenation is unreadability. For pre-3.6 python versions you should use normal string formatting, i.e. `'{} blah {}`.format(foo, bar)`.
 &gt;No you don't, there are plenty of other UI toolkits. Can you give a list of UI Toolkits which are better than PyQt? &gt;And not everyone builds desktop software for Windows. Almost every person in the world I know uses desktop apps for windows/Mac. I have no idea what you are talking about. Even people who use web apps, use a version of desktop apps that work offline and sync later. You are full of shit.
I guess you could iterate through a list or something? Like `for i in attributes: setattr(cls, i, getattr(obj, i))`
fuck. tk. inter.
I don't think the legality of it is too much of an issue, more that they've got to make it play friendly with all the proprietary stuff from a technical perspective.
And before 3.6, `dict(d1, **d2)` is slightly uglier but valid
If you want to handle a csv, you might want to import use the 'csv' module, which is part of the standard distribution. It makes reading and writing csv files a lot easier. You might find [this](http://www.pythonforbeginners.com/csv/using-the-csv-module-in-python) helpful.
Just a few days back the PSF were asking for people to try out `warehouse`, the new (hopefully) improved pypi.
I was wondering if there were some custom scripts like this out there. Did you try nginx+gunicorn before going down this road?
I always thought it was funny that the PyPy interpreter is written in python.
&gt; I would have if electron/JS option wasn't available In the UK we say put up or shut up. As you haven't done the former then please do the latter, especially as PyQt is no doubt completely irrelevant to a lot of python programmers, myself included. 
lol you are a idiot kid. I will let you stay that way. I don't give a shit about Python, JS or any language as long as it gives me a solution to my requirements. I am not fanatic of any language as you seem to be. What a stupid kid.
Sorry, what is your question?
Worth noting, this only works if all of the keys in `d2` are strings.
I always considered Python as a user friendly language which is why I thought the devs in the community would be so as well. But every time I open a comment section in this sub, someone with a more novel idea is getting please-get-back-in-line downvote treatment. It’s a letdown to see. Python has seen a lot more use of late, but the discussion here is as stale as ever. There’s a lot of empathy in the idea of making it easier to get Python code out there. Being so weirdly defensive and abrasive about someone’s suggestion is just odd. There are lots of new python devs out there as of late. It would pay to be in friendlier spirits. 
Awesome! Thanks for clarifying. 
Ah, I get it now. Even though you can read it in a txt editor the encoding is someone different than if I had just put the text and values into vi or nano then had my script read it. Since the lesson was focusing on actual txt files the way I read it got the BOM. The actual lesson I had to do for the class was really short and just had us read "I'm" from a file and append " Batman" to it. Which is why I came up with a more complicated problem to work on for my own extra practice.
Pycharm. It has an amazing debugger, runs tests, version control, docker integration, virtual environments, sphinx integration, coverage, debugger, database connectivity, debugger. did I mention the debugger?
So have reminders work like alarms?
Yeah. Eventually all could be supported by a core module, or at least some things like packaging tools for each could be part of the standard library. It would certainly streamline a lot of things. I don't really see it to be any different than cross platform support like what is offered by os and sys.
Visual Studio Code one editor, all solution.. :)
As per the sidebar I guess you should check out /r/learnpython. As for your question I don't know what you are trying to do with the `w=` keyword argument, but otherwise this works: ``` firstlist = [('A', 'B'), ('A', 'D')] secondList = [1, 2] finalList = [] for i in range(len(firstlist)): finalList.append(firstlist[i]+(secondList[i],)) ```
Basically yes. I have an echo dot, but I've also built a few raspberry pi units with some custom wav files encoded that played at certain times to give various reminders via cron and aplay. Then with alexapi and a custom Alexa skill I could control the pi as a headless unit with my voice. The reason being that I use it as a special needs assistant for those that need reminders to "take their medicine" etc. My method is kind of a hodgepodge of a few different things to make it work and no where near as nice as telling the assistant to, "remind so and so at 6pm to take their medicine everyday." Hope that gives you a better idea of the what and the why.
What framework doesn't require restarting an application after a code change? You're not developing under Apache.. are you?
Thats great, congratulations on being retired. Hope its treating you well and I'll definitely do my best to make the most of what I learn with Python.
Is the code available 
This is awesome! I've been wanting to make a webscraper to download an image off of a website (changes often) and then make it my background.
I’ve always wanted one similar, let me know how you download from the site!
That's definitely the challenge I force not happening lol. I'm fairly new to python, but that's going to be my first "project".
I’m fairy new as well, I’ve not found any way of doing this kind of thing yet, although I’m sure it’s possible as I knew someone who had a program that downloaded train and bus times and told them the quickest route (a proof of concept for your idea at least)
Depends on how you learn. The best approach for me was to find a project I wanted to do then learn as I go via YouTube, trial and error, and documentation.
That downvote wasn't from me, BTW.
It’s reddit trolls abound.
No, it's not. Those in Python are mostly tests (Lib/tests) and included packages external to the interpreter (/Lib/*). The interpreter's source code is in the "Python" subdirectory: https://github.com/python/cpython/tree/master/Python 
No, not an option, we are running Apache
sit is down — reddit killed it
PyQt may be one of the better UI toolkits available. However: &gt; You need PyQt to develop an user interface to your script so that non developers/non tech folks can use it. is a complete lie. If I needed a quick interface to a script, it would most likely be coded in Tkinter. I built and entire ERP app in Tkinter. No it isn't as lovely as it would be in Qt. But I sure didn't "need" Qt.
My man
You're not making any friends with that display big empathy. I'm trying to give you a perspective. Most people using Python are _not_ creating desktop apps for Windows using QT. It's a niche. Python would not be my first, second or third choice when building a desktop app or a mobile app. It is however very popular in web development and in data science where your problem largely does not exist.
if you think using a language to create desktop apps is a niche, then the language gas stagnated. Reason JS is exploding in use is because it has stable platform for developing desktop apps(Electron), Web Apps(node) and mobile apps.
The need to restart isn't a requirement of the framework. It's a requirement of mod_wsgi, which is specific to Apache. I was trying out Apache because the django documentation recommends it, but it sounds like nginx may be a better choice.
I've enjoyed Al's books. He's also very helpful via email if you have a detailed question/problem. http://inventwithpython.com/
TLDR Not a guide but a sales pitch for docker / a docker course
I can't speak to the legal side of things - but do they **know** something is up? If not, have you considered presenting what you **could** do to your manager, and ask if they have some more stuff you could automate and bring efficiencies into? For example, if you are completely automated... can your new job be to help automate some of the other processes in/around your company? Can you perhaps build an ETL system that allows OTHERS to use your automation? That way, you stay relevant.
Wait exactly why can they take your salary back? part of the NDA agreement if you break it?
Yep. Needs a "for humans" version built from the ground up, without multiprocessing underneath it.
Curious what host/hosting service you went with? I'm boarding that train soon so to speak. 
something like that, its rather in my contract I didnt want to ask around to attract unwanted attention, but from a colleague I trust I was told that apparently someone used to do this for years and outsource to an Asian country, it was rly sensitive data. As the company I am working for was previously not that big, they put this condition in so no one would do it again, and if they did they would have some of the money back to help cover the damage I suppose. thats what I have been told anyway, and I signed it
I dont know to be honest, i just want to be safe, people have been snooping around but my main manager found out and told someone, i heard this from someone and it cant be made it, very unlikely for it to be so similar. If I do present it, im not sure I will be rendered useless I am pretty sure there is maybe two of us doing this max, and even after I have completed my report someone else double checks it (so ofc I added some deliberate errors in my script etc) And I asked about this previously, adn it was more like we are a small company, "we dont have time for this" and "that extra teaching etc etc, we agree but the boss says this etc etc" What exactly do you mean by an ETL system?
I actually do, they user python 3 at my work
Long story short I cant but I think they know, what exactly is an ETL system? And not really they just say "we are a small company we havent got time to teach anyone, etc etc" that nonsense, so im not ina good position, i already tried offering my abilities to help with the receptionist but the just disregarded it
At first I thought it was smart, they was mainly just managers of projects rather than technical people, they wouldnt suspect anything - I was thinking in my head i had the recording to see what I did in history and was doing it at the same time? that might be a good excuse if they bring that up. I am thinking of getting one, never really done this before that why I am kind of scared plus I am young, its because I signed the contract its an idiotic clause, but no1 will dare do it again if that makes sense.
I have to restart gunicorn when I do django. And IIS when I do asp.net.
Are you in the US? If so, it will be almost impossible to take two years salary away from you without going to court. If you use direct deposit, then I would stop using that checking account and switch everything over to a different bank, just in case your boss is a tool. A NDA means that you can't disclose company information to anyone who is not specifically authorized by the company to see it. Did you do this? A non-compete means that you can't go to work for a competitor for a set time frame after leaving the company. Did you do that? Many lawyers will offer a free consultation to see if you're a good fit. Take in a copy of the contract that you signed and be honest with them. Don't lie to anyone, that will only make things worse. I'd tell them "I used a company computer that the company assigned to me to do computer work that the company assigned to me. I don't understand what's going on." 
But since you're not outsourcing, you're not breaking the NDA. They can't take back your salary. Moreover, none of this is wrong. The worst thing you did was to automate a system they didn't know what able to be automated. If you present it like you did a good thing, you can sell yourself as a definite boon to them. They could even save money because, hey, you're the wiz, what else can you automate? That said, lying is wrong, and lying further could get you into even more serious trouble. On this issue, go with honesty and accept the consequences. On your future resume, say you saved the company $[your salary] per year in automation. Boom, future job.
Cool idea for a project!
If they have already caught you - you can't control that. If they haven't - you can present a positive business thinking face, instead of this sneaky one. If you go to your manager and present it as - "Hey in my free time I've figured out a way to make these great automatic reports! CHeck it out!" You are owning up to your accomplishments, and then you are inviting them to say "Nice work!" or "Stop it - do it the long way". For all you know they don't understand what you are doing and don't trust it. So build in some education in your presentation. Managing-up is an important skill and one you should be working on building. If **YOU** have an automated job, I bet you have other co-workers that are ALSO in need of automation. So instead of tricking them, embrace it and help them to move the needle. Develop infrastructure and reporting that others can utilize to get more work done. You mentioned reports so I heard "Extract, Transform, Load" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load DevOps, ETLs, etc. are all about providing value. If you've made automation that can fool your company for 2yrs - you clearly know how to provide value.
I mean, automating your job *is* smart, if you do it correctly.
{ 'you' : 'know' } 
and btw i meant they have the potential to claim back my salary up to two years (the time i worked there)
Last time I checked Spotify was a JS + HTML app running in a tiny shell that manages Chromium webviews. When I was a Linux dev, Dropbox still used GTK+ at least on Linux. Please refrain from calling everyone idiots because they happen not to share your priorities.
I think the Python Software Foundation might be wary of "picking the winner" regarding Python executable bundling and cross-platform GUI frameworks. It's complicated by the number of platforms they'd have to support. I think their view is to just let 3rd parties sort it out.
Deny you were using the video to pretend you were doing work. Just say you were trying out screen recording because you thought you would need to use it for a presentation (or just insert lame excuse). 
Hi, What kind of error did you get? The site is loading ok here. It served the request in 2ms on the nginx side of things and then another 18ms for it to reach my place of residence.
LPT: No matter what you did wrong, lying about it makes it worse.
Thank you! I figured it would be simple enough for a first project, and I mean me managing that is a testament to its simplicity xD
*shrug* Presumably you have a job or task description that says, "Get X spreadsheets, compile report with data, send out report". If it doesn't specifically say, "manually and laboriously copy and paste each value", you're pretty safe legally and they can't take your pay back, you've performed the tasks as required. So tell them that you've been working on a script and that you check the results before sending the data out. If they're not keeping tabs on you enough to spot that you're doing very little during the day, well, that's on them. Tell them that you've been fine-tuning your script if you want to fix a few edge cases, no doubt you've been doing some tweaking occasionally. They'll take the discovery of this automation one of two ways: - They'll be aghast, and fire your sorry ass. You're better off not working for companies such as this. - They'll be interested in this script. If you're careful, you keep doing what your doing and can spin this into automating other things in the business in your "spare time". 
&gt;When I was a Linux dev, Dropbox still used GTK+ at least on Linux. lol. Funny that you are in Python subreddit and don't know which mainstream apps were developed in Python, shows how ignorant you are https://www.codeschool.com/blog/2016/01/27/why-python/ "The Dropbox desktop client is written entirely in Python, which speaks to its cross-platform compatibility. Dropbox has about 400 million users and considering it isn’t bundled with any operating system distribution, that’s a lot of users downloading and installing Dropbox. In addition to their desktop client, Dropbox’s server-side code is in Python as well, making it the majority language used at the company.

I haven't tried it yet, but it sounds like you might not have to restart gunicorn if you use [the --reload option](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12773763/gunicorn-autoreload-on-source-change). 
Right now i'm more angry at the fact that i have to do an HTTP GET for every frame or find a way to drop some. Also when running in foreground i have to hit ctrl-c when initializing the screen for some reason.
No you can definitely read CSV files with open(). It's just a little more tedious. Here's one way you could do it (I haven't tested this code but the idea is sound.) with open("my_file.csv", "r") as f: data = f.read() list = [] for line in data.split("\n"): list += [line.split(",")] 
So say we all. In your defense, matplotlib was never designed to be intuitive from first principles. It was designed to be intuitive to people used to the Matlab plotting API.

I'm just a dude who has spent 20 years developing web apps with many different techs and documenting my process. About 5 years ago, I used the exact strategy I documented in that post to set up a Python environment (without Docker). I found it to be not that great because of all of the problems I listed. The only reason I write about Docker is because it legit changed my entire development to production work flow for the better. As the article mentions, you can continue not using Docker and just follow the non-Docker technology choices. No one is forcing you to buy anything. You could even read the ~70 Docker related blog posts on my site for free if you were curious about Docker in general.
1. i mean there is no fine print saying you cant automate it, really does any jobs specifically say that? 2. Yes, but I adjusted it to make mistakes and errors 3. On the work laptop
Give specific examples of how using python would be advantageous versus current technologies. 
1. That was my point. 2. That’s the dishonest part that will get you fired. You sabotaged your job performance to avoid detection. An honest mistake won’t get your fired but a deliberate one....? 3. Are you authorized to install python or if it came with it, were you authorized to use it?
GTK+ is a UI toolkit (in fact the most popular one on Linux thanks to GNOME being the most common desktop environment) that comes with Python bindings. I am not going to comment on that.
spins and spins and nothing..
There is always an API, it may not be documented, but it has to exist.
Where do you live? Are you behind a proxy? Are you using a VPN? I also just checked http://downforeveryoneorjustme.com/nickjanetakis.com and it says it's up.
&gt;From the article: I know, this is where you’re thinking “omg, this whole thing was a sales pitch for buying a Docker course” you said it not us...
I'm sorry if I've put you on the defensive, the TLDR is intentionally stark to help readers who may think it's a guide, step by step etc - which was my interpretation of the title. Selling isn't always about money e.g. championing Docker's benefits while the community edition is free
There *was* an API that *used* to exist. But they explicitly shut down token access for everything but viewing content. 
Well first consider whether or not python is actually better than what you're currently doing. If everyone already knows Java/Matlab, is it really worth it to use a whole new language? Then give specific examples where python shines over your current setup, and give some disadvantages to python as well. Even better would be to **show** why python would be better.
When it comes to python, can you really say this is an abuse of exceptions, though? I mean, python considers [non-infinite loops](https://docs.python.org/2/library/exceptions.html#exceptions.StopIteration) to be an exceptional case, for pete's sake.
Or use a library written on top of matplotlib, like Seaborn
Gotta have a demo. You have to show them something IF it is ever going to work. I’ve done my own thing a couple of times and have mostly had success. But there could be consequences to making it look like you don’t appreciate the way they are doing things. I’ve used Matlab extensively and it has a ton to offer, so make sure you are setting yourself up to expand your horizons too. I fall back to the idea that you owe it to yourself to state your professional opinion and point out opportunities where you can. And then you wait and let time tell. Either they come around or they don’t. 
Poor title choice! Was really hoping for docker tutorial
Have you ever used a package manager from another language? Pip is fine, but barebones compared to even the dotnet package manage which allows you to create projects via templates.
Hi, There is a full Docker tutorial which is linked in the article, here's the snippet: &gt; I have a whole tutorial on [running a real world Flask application with Docker](https://nickjanetakis.com/blog/dockerize-a-flask-celery-and-redis-application-with-docker-compose) if you want to read it. It doesn’t go into the gory details of everything, but you will have a real world Flask app running in Docker in about 15 minutes. It goes over setting up a Flask app with Celery and Redis to work with Docker Compose.
Totally unrelated to python, but I feel bad for this poor Wizard with 17 Con and 9 Int. Soldier background indeed. Can force an interesting story though. Maybe they were really just a run of the mill soldier and they're deciding to dabble into illusion magic despite having difficulties.
You can start by reading the sidebar. Then you could post in the right sub. Then you could google the elements of what you're trying to do.
It sort of is step by step guide, but instead of directly in-lining the installation guides for each piece of technology (such as pip, virtualenv and honcho), I link out to those project's main sites. At that point you could install them if you decide to go that route.
To add to this, I would ask for a raise. Then if they keep you on at your current salary everyone wins. But the act of hiding your acts does speak dishonesty..
Why is PyPy so fast? It is written in line noise!
I meant that the website/app need to work somehow, you can always pretend to be an actual human user doing human things, or document the undocumented API.
I would add A Life Lesson here, the moment that you use terms like they wouldn't suspect anything. What you're doing is not something that a business will appreciate. If one of my employees came to me and said hey I figured out a way to automate my job, I would immediately think of bigger and better ways to implement that employee. If one of my employees came and said they won't suspect anything, even if the act that he did wasn't something I would terminate over- sneaking around is. It speaks to your character, listen to that voice it'll help you further in the long run

What if you give a program an image link from a website, then it sets your desktop background automatically? No need to download manually etc etc. (?)
Hahaha maybe! Though the raw stats are there so they can be reassigned if needs be. 
if you look at the download stats for cheese shop (pypi) you will realize that most python developers are not using python for desktop apps. Currently, I would recommend c# winforms, javafx, electron or unity for desktop apps.
also /u/patrys dropbox used to use gtk but switched to Qt recently. I believe they may still have some dependency on gtk.
&gt;(so ofc I added some deliberate errors in my script etc) You have only made the situation worse for yourself. Automating your job is something everyone should do and if you can automate yourself out of a job that's fantastic and typically comes with a promotion. What you did however is not automating your job in good faith. You appear to have deliberately sought to shirk your responsibilities so you could slack and INTENTIONALLY injected errors into the process. You also intentionally misled your coworkers by recording and playing a loop of work being done. You aren't going to get in trouble for automating things, you're going to get in trouble for lying and misleading you coworkers and that's a hole you dug yourself. Your best bet is probably to tell your boss about the stuff you automated. Perhaps remind him that you automated everything while still doing the job at full capacity, though you've undermined that argument by intentionally inserting errors into the reports. For future reference the correct thing to do is automate your work and tell your boss that you automated it. You don't necessarily have to tell them everything is fully automated but the goal is to get more work and expand your role not sit around doing nothing.
This sounds very elaborate and highly unlikely. Cool story. If this is actually true, try not to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory at your *next* job.
RPython*, an altogether different beast.
Thank you i didnt know there was such a place!

What’s my purpose? To set the background. Notices that you can right click the pic and click set background with 2 clicks. Program explodes... Sidenote: Cool small project tho. Useful for people who often have issues searching after right clicking or the lazy people in general...
Lookin' good
Article briefly mentions PEP567, which will be in 3.7 and solve this problem: https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/contextvars.html
&gt; I'm not defensive You're coming across as pretty defensive, which is strange because there's nothing wrong with 'pitching' things... But people may not be interested in reading it, thus this comment chain
For development you should use mod_wsgi-express. It has a command line option to enable automatic reload on code changes. See: * http://blog.dscpl.com.au/2015/05/using-modwsgi-express-as-development.html If you are using system Apache and manually configuring it for mod_wsgi, the documentation for mod_wsgi provides code you can use to have it reload on code changes: * http://modwsgi.readthedocs.io/en/develop/user-guides/reloading-source-code.html#monitoring-for-code-changes The thing you have to be very careful of is that automatic reloading can resulting in breaking your application because it can reload code before you are finished making a set of changes. As a consequence, you should never use automatic code reloading on systems which are actively used by others especially production systems. This is why it requires a manual action by default, of either restarting Apache or touching the WSGI script file. That way you know changes are ready for a restart to be performed.
I like that part "don't lie to anyone". This makes a big different in many things in life, not only work.
https://github.com/stonewell/pygui This old project looks good.
"plt change x axis label" "plt set figure size" "plt set axis limits" "plt save image" "plt line ..." .... x 100 My google history every time I use matplotlib (weekly). Or at least it used to be. Now my searches are prefixed with "sns"! 
There's a tutorial in the docs for using setuptools and twine, also includes publishing to PyPI. Also, strangely enough, the docs for the Click lib have a great walkthrough on using setuptools for packaging. Sorry I don't have links for you. I'm on mobile.
This is well written and a great guide for using matplotlib effectively. It was only after I started using the OO approach described here did I really begin to be able to make plots just the way I wanted - I wish I had read something like this sooner.
I am calling my function within main. If i call main after it says " not enough values to unpack(expected 3, got 1)
Their official docs are great! https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/distributing-packages/
Total python noob here but finished tinkering on a game engine I'm working on using pygame. It was originally a "box pusher" game but I'm repurposing the engine to hopefully create an MMORTS/dungeon crawler game with a crypto economy (actively looking for technical co-founders btw). Anyone interested can check out the github: https://github.com/jonargyne/stronghodl
You could have conditioned yourself to using the parenthesis by using `from __future__ import print_function` in python2.
Well, they picked Tkinter and Guido long ago (2003) said wxpython is the best GUI framework out there. Times change though. People have opinions and those change when a program takes 12 years to support Python 3.x.
Looking for technical co-founders to help work on Stronghodl, a dungeon crawler/MMORTS concept with a cryptocurrency-based economy. Currently just have a basic game engine that needs to be hacked into the prototype piece by piece. Here's the github, happy to connect via Skype with anyone who wants to learn more, user id: 'jonargyne' Github: https://github.com/jonargyne/stronghodl
Basically, yes: it's just random functions from the most popular github repos with some filtering applied. E.g docstrings are cut from the functions, too short/long functions are ignored etc.
 Vim and cmd... I'm a monster
I'm not sure I live in the same world as all of these commenters. Where are you that being honest about automating your job results in good things for you? Business isn't out there to be your buddy and help you out once you've shown you're unnecessary. They'll take your program(s), because anything you do on company time is stolen from you, get rid of you, and continue on trying to milk every dollar out of every situation without regard for any impact on human life. Employees aren't humans, they're tools.
And the options he has covered are not much better. The GUI story for Python sucks.
Slow down
TLDR; a range object is an iter**able** not an iter**ator**. That took way too long to get to.
&gt; In Python an iterable is anything that you can iterate over and an iterator is the thing that does the actual iterating. So you give a definition and revoke it later on (obviously) - the above is simply *true* for ``ramge`` objects 😉 You could add a short disclaimer there that this is not sufficient as definition as shown below? But overall I really liked the article; and I must confess that I never have thought about this so explicitly until today.
The official Python docs already make it pretty clear that they're sequences, but good write up nonetheless. https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#typesseq
This is what I get when using Quora as source, I should know better than to trust shady sources..
Here is another option that I personally prefer -- Create a `dict` with the tuple `(row, col)` as the key and the `Table` instance as the value, b = {(row, col): Table() for row in range(8) for col in range(8)} You can access any particular element by doing `b[(row, col)]` I use this design for my sudoku solver - https://github.com/siddhi/python-training/blob/instructor/sudoku/sudoku.py In that code the `Board` class contains the overall board, while the `Cell` class contains data on each individual cell in the board. That said, you can definitely use a flat list (like the one you have in your post) or a list of lists approach (as proposed by /u/crunk) as well. There is no right or wrong way.

Finally put my app on the [vscode marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=almenon.arepl) Fixed a couple bugs and added timing info so you can see how long your code took to execute. 
Was this seriously good or shit?? xd
Thanks for showing me that, wolf looks pretty cool. I wouldn't say it's an alternative though - more like a complement. You can run wolf and arepl at the same time. Maybe I could even integrate it into AREPL.
Alternatively: **TLDR;** range is a sequence, not an iterator But that does sort of gloss over the big section on what iterators are. I actually wrote this somewhat as an excuse to *explain what iterators are* because I suspect folks misusing the term might not know how they work. I may be off base and the issue could be that they don't fully understand how range works though.
No negatives no problem :) I just released my app to the [marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=almenon.arepl), btw.
We all react to the entitlement. /u/SpecialistComment come waltzing in and demand that something should be provided to him for free. That attitude will not make you friends.
It really is a game changer!
Calling it shit would be understatement.
I had a fault in my thoughts, you are right. Also I forgot a *not* in my first paragraph. Sorry for the confusion. 
Itinerant iteratables iterate inimically
Made a discord bot for our server that shows Fortnite BR stats when you request them in a cool little graphic. Most of the work was getting the "official" API to work properly, since there really isn't one.
barcelona,no, no. but it is up now 😜 
Well... Docker is a new technology and not without bugs. For example, there's also some unfortunate aspects of running your code in container, and then having to work with the artifacts stored on your system (eg. if you mount a volume from host filesystem into container to say, store logs): you will have to deal with user management. Say, you are on Linux, and you want logs to be stored under your user's account, then you would need to mount `/etc/passwd` into container and pass it `--user` and `--group` on each run... but if your user comes from LDAP... You'd still need to learn a good deal about filesystems, perhaps even re-partition your disk to make Docker work faster... logical partitions, udev, fdisk, cgroups... every now and then you'll have to fish for the documentation of obscure parameters in `/sys`... It's only simple if you do very little with it. Docker on MS Windows / Mac OS is even worse integrated because it has to run in a VM, so you'd still need to learn about port forwarding of your VM player, how to mount volumes into your VM player etc. But why would anyone want to program on those systems is beyond me, so idk.
Don't you have any logs of the installation? When I compiled 3.6 I didn't have libsqlite on my system, and it was clearly written during the compilation.
±0.5°C accuracy up to 85°C, which works fine for the strict 77°C target temperature of the lautering process. However, the boiling process requires a more flexible 104°C, so even 102 or 106 would be technically acceptable here if the error margin truly grows to ±2°C. Truth is that accuracy is truly determined by methods of calibration and we aim to calibrate our DS18B20s on the higher end of the spectrum, as they will really only be used in heated kettles.
Others have said, Pyinstaller is the way to go. Make sure you know your project inside and out, doing so will make it easier to configure Pyinstaller.
It depends on your specific use case. For general data analysis you have numpy, scipy and pandas. One of the big plusses of python are the generators that enable you to handle large datasets without taking all your RAM. Pandas is also able to read data in chunks which has a similar effect. Though I reckon that the best you can do is to produce a sample report of what can be done with python. Other advantages are that: * It is free, no licenses needed * Syntax is somewhat similar to matlab for math and plotting * Actively being used and developed in industry. * Ability to use python for batch processes. * Ability to interact directly with SQL databases (e.g. sqlAlchemy)
Thanks for the link.
No worries! I wish the words iterable and iterator were more dissimilar. I mistype/read one for the other all the time!
The `range` function in Python 2 actually returned a list, which is also not an iterator. The `enumerate` and `reversed` functions have always returned iterators. The `zip`, `map`, and `filter` functions used to return lists and now they return iterators as well.
