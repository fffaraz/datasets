\&gt; True in the REPL does not show up but ide like pycharm will show it. This is again more of a "target audience" issue, but say you are developing something that is not for internal developer use, it would be quite limiting to have this information missing \(or would require adding the info to docstrings nonetheless, which would then render the type comments redundant\). Anyways, I will probably adopt the Python 3.5 type annotations in my private projects and see how I like it in practice. It does sound like a nice feature to me
&gt; Just be careful with your loops - a common source of subtle bugs is the last line (or several lines) of a loop being indented wrong. It's not a syntax error and it will usually parse and run... It just won't do what you want. This is a good tip. Thanks!
Hey I just wanted to thank you, /u/krisbykreme, /u/doulos05, and /u/scrdest - kind of a amazed that I got 4 good answers to that quick question at the end. Thanks!
For the "**How influential are they?**" part, I suggest looking at the tweet to like/retweet ratio. You'll find something interesting...
Sure
I'm going to suggest that python may not be your best choice here. It can probably do it, but there are better tools for this. On would be open frameworks - a C++ multiplatform framework that - with plugins - would be able to build this quite easily. It could even run on a raspberry pi. 
I heard some good feedback about nuitka ! Good luck with that packaging. 
The former is very bad form given it's in the language spec to not do that. Fundamentally though, it's the same, except it's slower. If your code needs to support a float, tuple, list, and numpy array by up promoting you can simplify a lot of the logic.

Know pip 10 threw a wrench in the works, but still feel like 2018 is a tad slow compared to 2017. Regardless, keep up the great work JetBrains folks. Love your product. Use it every day, and am better at my job for it.
This makes the 3rd significant "push" from someone toward learning flask in my life. That's my cue to dedicate my summer project to something flask related. Guess I'll be rewriting my webapp from Django to flask this summer! It has the added bonus of easily getting around any possible IP issues moving the app to my new employer, so that's a double plus!

&gt; Here’s something else: sometimes you wouldn’t need to even load a page to get dynamically generated data. Often (more so for foreign sites…) the data can be get-requested easily with no credentials. You can use Chrome’s dev-tools (press F12) to watch the network traffic when you request stuff or load a page, and catch which request sends for that data. You might luck out and get the data you want as a nicely organized and very fast JSON file, meaning no need to slowly load and parse lots of useless HTML, you can just use the Requests or url.lib packages to request the url for that JSON data. This is how I do it. Either the devs made it easy on themselves (and me, in the process) and built an API or they're loading pre-rendered HTML (yuck) and I can still parse it with `requests_html` or whatever.
But what platform/OS u're using?
There is no single answer. It's always "it depends". For example, Bokeh is a very nice tool and you get interactivity almost for free. However if you have a very complicated site, you will find that it's not as straight forward as you imagined. On the other hand, you could use Altair or Vega, create your plot definitions in JSON and use a websocket to send update data. Spec'ing out a vega chart is more than a little annoying and you don't get the nice interactivity you do with Bokeh. In either case, you can do an awful lot with something like bottle / flask and a vega or bokeh. You can then use things like the QtWebEngine to embed the site into a desktop app for example.

Got a 4K screen and this almost reaches the edge. How do people actually read code that this? Word wrap is turned on?
Also, sorry if this is the wrong sub to ask this question. Given that my question is explicitly about hardware, but with constraints... I wasn't sure whether to post in r/Python, r/Mac, r/WebDev, r/HomeAssistant, r/AskProgramming, r/LearnProgramming, r/SmartMirrors, or even /r/Raspberry_Pi for ideas.
Thank you for the feedback! I really like the QTWebEngine idea. It seems simple enough and could show some nice data feeds. I am not too familiar with Django or Flask development. Would setting up websockets to send data be something I would need to really learn Django to do? I never did get into the web development side of Python.
My group and I are using python installed from [python.org](https://python.org), using pip to install packages, and Atom.io to edit and run code, including Flask apps \(using the Script extension\).
Regarding pip 10: Python should be used to backwards-incompatible upgrades by now :-)
I know you have a section about why your not using a RPi, however, have you considered using the RPi just for the temp/humidity monitoring? You can keep the shazam functionality running on the Mac mini and been have it periodically poll the RPi for temp/humidity data. The RPi can just dump data to a file at a given interval and then the Mac mini just had to read this data via SSH or anything other protocol.
Can confirm PYTHONPATH does not need to be set for the standard libs. Thanks for the pointer. 
That’s pretty cool!
You're using Python 3, which uses `input` instead of `raw_input`. Also, /r/learnpython.
Your issue is either your actual PATH variable or your PYTHONPATH variable. Check your environment vars from your launching shell. You probably used a poorly designed installer at some point that added these directly to your `.bash_profile` or `.bashrc` I’ve seen several bad python installation recommendations that involve directly adding dist-packages or other non-bin paths directly to your path. There’s also rarely a good use for the PYTHONPATH variable unless you really know what you’re doing - you always want to let the binary figure it out instead of forcing it statically in your envvars when you have multiple versions of python installed.
I resorted to just writing html on the server every minute
thank you. I'll delete this post now.
Why not let a third party handle the dashboard, such as elastic, and you just need to write something to send the data in.
pandas, scipy are R-like packages as far as I understand. Also jupyter notebook is pretty leading edge for work stuff.
Wish i could, but i can't :/
You're welcome. Now, please don't use % formatting on SQL again, and it's all fine!
I second this. It would be a small investment, but there is much more potential for growth to add more functionality in the future. 
thanks for the pointers. Unfortunately, they didn't have anything setting the PYTHONPATH. I don't have a .bash_profile, maybe that's a linux mint thing? Though google showed me that I do have a .profile, and that also had nothing even mentioning python.
I'd highly recommend using django\-channels and redis for this, here's a decent guide on something semi\-similar: [https://medium.com/@auxyz/creating\-a\-cryptocoin\-price\-ticker\-with\-django\-2\-0\-part\-one\-2b628deb85d9](https://medium.com/@auxyz/creating-a-cryptocoin-price-ticker-with-django-2-0-part-one-2b628deb85d9)
I saw annotations somewhere and tried using them, I was able to pass other types and figured it didn't work. I hadn't realized that there were tools to use with the annotations. Thanks for the info. 
Python 2.7 is almost deprecated 
Nice. Some other factors keeping information local that the author didn’t mention: fear of saying something wrong and looking stupid, and permanence - once something is publicly on the internet you can not erase it. We as net citizens can be quite intolerant sometimes. 
Isn’t Grafana the standard for Dashboard time based data? Use python to ingest the data and store it somewhere, then have Grafana read from the data store.
Can I get a link to the book please
Yet another suggestion: mathplotlib seems to have animation support. That library is used where I work usually for static stuff but folks seem like it for its ease of use with python. It's not web based though, more like a library that once invoked, opens a GUI up and the python code updates it. For my own team, for real-time stuff, our python stuff talks Web Application Messaging Protocol (WAMP) to a central server using publish/subscribe queues and a meteor based front end picks up and renders changes to the user. Is the stuff you're working on private or could you share some more details on what you're trying to accomplish? (eg. what do the RFID cards and numbers represent?) (PS. ever get KF2?) 
&gt; I've been messing with my python a lot lately trying to get openCV to play nicely Don't mess with your system Python. Ever. A step towards fixing your problem might be calling `dpkg -S` on files/directories in your Python directories, and see which files aren't covered by your package manager. You may want to delete those files. But generally, you fucked up by messing with your system Python, and it's difficult to manually fix.
I would suggest Plotly Dash over anything else. It's remarkably easy to plug in real-time data using deques. There's even a python programming tutorial on it. https://pythonprogramming.net/data-visualization-application-dash-python-tutorial-introduction/

The link in that post to [how to run an async team](https://github.com/maxogden/async-team) was quite interesting. \(Albeit this started off\-topic and that takes it even further off.)

Python is really only second to JavaScript and it's irrelevant that you're talking to healthcare industry as Python is one of the fastest growing languages. It's only one level away from the sea but it something like five times easier to read, it's very easy to create little Proto types and it's touring complete so it's very strong.
&gt; Would setting up websockets to send data be something I would need to really learn Django to do? for what you're trying to accomplish, the backend will be pretty simple compared to the dashboard itself. essentially the backend just has to accept requests, persist data somehow (log files or db), and shovel data up a websocket. if it stays simple, you don't even need a framework at all. you can just use the `websockets` library and your entire backend could fit on a single page if you need multiple endpoints or non-ws communication, you can get up and running with flask pretty quickly. unless you have other requirements like user management or authentication, django might be overkill. it will definitely have a longer learning curve, but if you plan to grow this project, i'd suggest learning django if you need something more robust than development servers provided by one of the frameworks, you will probably spend more time doing server config than developing the backend. 
We have [a pretty long list of learning resources in the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/index#wiki_new_to_programming.3F). Try a few and see what resonates.

What is "Visibility Graph Simulator"? What is the general idea? What does it do? In which contexts/field this appears? Sorry if this is a stupid question. I am curious. 
While I agree that the Project Euler questions are a great way to get into programming in a language, it sounds to me as if in this situation your job will not to be a great Python programmer but to do statistical work, with Python instead of SPSS or R as the tool to support that. If that's the case \(and if it's not, I'm not clear why they brought you in for an interview\), what you probably want to do is take some of the things that demonstrate your knowledge at the job itself and show that you can learn to do them in Python. So look around the 'net for tutorials on solving in Python the particular kinds of problems you'll be working on. I do development and QA process improvement in a Python shop. \(And I came in with no Python experience.\) If someone without Python experience came in for an interview, I'd be impressed if they told me they'd spent a day playing with at the various unit test frameworks and told me why they thought Pytest was better than the others. That would tell me that, though they don't know Python, they know unit testing and it's just a matter of learning a different flavour of the general concept. \(And that they understand how to generalise these ideas across programming languages.\) But if they showed me that they could solve Project Euler problems, I would still have no idea if they even understand unit testing, much less if they can take what they know from having done it in one language to others. In the same way, I'd imagine if you came in saying you started with no Python knowledge but quickly picked up how to do the things you do in NumPy and Pandas \(or whatever\), your interviewer would believe you could quickly learn to effectively do the job you're being hired to do.
Sorry quite new to reddit ..... Still trying to get the hang of it 
Thx!
Almost all of them say that for me
Thank you very much! I have to admit I'm a bit hesitant about C\+\+, it always seemed like a tough language \(I never tried it, I just assumed that\). I really just chose Python because I've always heard it's one of the most gentle languages. I really like Javascript because everything is so simple with it, but this is not a web app so that's out so I figured Python might be good. But I'll go check out the learning resources at open frameworks and see what I can do. Again, much appreciated!

I am generating secret and public api keys per user on signup. This part of the problem is sorted out using standard practices. Secret key is never sent over the network. It is added as kwarg to the client and then the client uses it to create a signature based on the message. 
I didn't really consider this. Good point!
TBH- I used it as an experiment to do something similar - in my case it was a OSC controlled multi-web cam app (used OSC to switch between cameras). The APIs are really well defined, and there's lots of examples out there. 
I like this idea and will definitely be going this route instead! Thanks

Python Crash Course
This misses what I find to be a key point about the 3.6 "type" annotations: they're entirely separate from the type checker you wish to use. [PEP 3107 annotations](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3107/) simply add some additional data to the function definitions. This does nothing unless something reads and makes use of those data. Most often I guess this would be [mypy](http://mypy-lang.org/), but pick a different library and you could use this for entirely different purposes, even unrelated to type checking. I think that this is a brilliant decision: there's a whole world of how one might do various kinds¹ of type checking. Just look at the the huge number of Haskell type system extensions available in [GHC](https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/) \(not to mention more outside of it\). That said, he's close when he says at the end, "I think type hinting is at the end of the day essentially the same as your unit tests, just expressed differently in code." Close, but there is a key difference. As Dijkstra said, "Testing shows the presence, not the absence of bugs." Type checks are small _proofs_ that certain bugs are absent, and are thus qualitatively different from tests. For what it's worth, I built a fairly major program (a high-frequency trading system) in Haskell around 2008, after almost a decade of Java and Ruby programming. I'm still a fan of TDD, but while in Java/Ruby/etc. anywhere from 40% to 60% of my code was tests, in Haskell that dropped to around 5%. (And this despite being a new language to me.) I also realized soon enough that I was spending considerably more time working on my type declarations than the code for the functions themselves. This wasn't "checking" work: the types _were_ the work and after I got them right I could almost type code randomly until the compiler passed it and the program would correctly do what it was supposed to do. --- ¹See what I [did there](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kind_(type_theory))?

Have you installed docutils?
An automatic text summariser for news articles. It’s objectively terrible, but I’ve wanted to make one for a while and it’s kind of my baby now.
Yes, I tried ```pip install docutils``` and it says **Requirement already satisfied**.

Not when SFTP isn't supported at the other end. SOC device. Only vanilla ssh and therefore vanilla scp.
Use the CrystaX NDK, as in [the documentation](https://python-for-android.readthedocs.io/en/latest/buildoptions/#python3).
Try upgrading, `pip install --upgrade docutils` and if that doesn't do it, uninstall it and the reinstall it. The error suggests it's got a mismatching version, since it's looking for a module in docutils that isn't there.
So I'm getting this error. **Cannot uninstall 'docutils'. It is a distutils installed project and thus we cannot accurately determine which files belong to it which would lead to only a partial uninstall.** I think it's because I have anaconda installed. How would you recommend I uninstall docutils?

PyPRI gives you a few advantages over that: - It supports upload of files via twine - It provides an authentication layer - you can control access to specific packages for individual users - You don't need to point it at a specific file - creating an account gives you a single repo with a single URL - you can create as many packages as you want in that repo - It manages versions for you - with a simple bucket of packages, you'd need to know the exact path to the file. With PyPRI, you just need to know the package name - It provides the convenience of not having to set up your own server - you could use a solution like pypicloud, but this takes time to set up, and you'd potentially need to pay to host it somewhere anyway

I've used matplotlib with very good success in the past. I would be 100% willing to use it again if the animations work the way I think they do. So far the examples I'm finding online don't seem to work in Jupyter. I'll have to play around with it tonight, but I like the idea of using matplotlib. I'm hearing a lot about using Web applications, Web Widgets/sockets and I'm going to try some examples out soon and see if it works out. The idea of it seems like it should work. It's just a personal project, the idea is tracking which glasses are picked up and for how long. This data could be valuable to optometrists (I have a lot of optometrists in my family some of which own franchises). It would allow them to see which brands are picked up, and how long the customer views them before putting them up. I've been doing Python for 8 or 9 months and thought this would be a great project to try out. So I got some RFID kits, some Pi Zeros and am now trying to show numbers on a screen to reflect the RFID outputs. I want the data to show accurately and quickly, I don't care for the looks as I can take care of that later. I just want a working model. Do you mean Killing Floor 2? Lol yeah, I actually have it for Steam and PS4, I think it was free on PS4 for a little while. What do you play on?
Yes! 
Hey guy. Is there a way to use the new pipfile format, but just install things like normal (no virtual environment)? I can't find anything online, just people who want to use their old requirements.txt with pipenv.
It’s great to be honest I like the content so far and I even subscribed 
I've never used it so have no idea, maybe `conda uninstall docutils` ?
Vue.js + Flask is personally my favorite combo out of the tools you suggested.
You're going to need to tell us a little bit more about what exactly you're working with and where your problem is.
Your company must be using a proxy which tries to act as a CA, but it cannot because no sane person would give some random company's proxy that kind of power. So, instead it just uses a self-signed certificate, which it then inserts in the chain of certificates that are used to sign messages exchanged between your internal network and the outside world. This is bad. Your IT should not do this. They probably did this without even knowing it, probably installed some junk like Pulse or some such "enterprise security solution", which did it for them. They probably don't know how to undo or disable this. However, what they may know is how to find and produce a certificate for their garbage proxy. Python uses it's own list of CAs, which it keeps somewhere in its installation (look for `*.crt` file in your Python installation directory). You will need to append the certificate that your IT will produce to the list of known CAs in that file.
Well, you shouldn't be "installing things like normal" in any case! This is not "normal", it's the not recommended way to do stuff! To answer your question, the whole point of Pipenv is to facilitate your workflow so that you can easily work with virtual environments (and extensions etc.). I guess you could make the pipenv generate a requirements.txt from the Pipfile (do a `pipenv lock -r) and use that for pip, but it's really convoluted and weird. Just use virtual environments! Life will be much easier and more organized with them. I get that you're worried that you'll have one more thing to worry about etc, but that's what pipenv is here to help you with! Here's your old workflow * Run `sudo pip install library_x` on Linux/macOS/BSD, or start an elevated PowerShell/Command Prompt on Windows and do `pip install library_x` * Start Python and use library_x Here's your new workflow: * `pipenv install library_x` (no sudo, no elevation) * `pipenv shell` * Run Python and use your library. Yes, it does seem like a step more, but it swallows the "sudo/elevated" stuff you need to do to install the "library_x" into your system. And of course, installing stuff in your system Python in Linux can go downhill fast.
For GPS access, you'll need a GPS-capable device. Do you mean GPS or IP-based location? As for displaying the location - if you're writing the app, you control whether or not that information is displayed... Have you tried googling something like "python gps"? Have you read the sidebar?
obstacles
Why do you want to uninstall it? Worst case, just trash the virtual environment and create a new one. If that doesn't work, then you *really* shouldn't be uninstalling it. If you're not using virtualenvs, start, and watch this and other problems melt away.
Last job was at a health care company that was all Python. During the job search for that job, I interviewed with two other health care companies using Python. Next week I'm interviewing at a health care company that uses Python. I've also talked to three other health care companies using Python. There are companies doing data science stuff with it. There are also a lot of companies that just use Python because it's a handy general-purpose language for building internal tools and gluing stuff together. Python != machine learning, and "uses Python" != "does ML".
Use flask to make a web server, then make a request to that server from your frontend (you can use the Axios JS library for that).
Which library?
Agreed. No need to create your own solution when you can let Grafana do the heavy lifting for you. You can just have a singlestat pane on the dashboard that will display the amount of cards scanned. You just have to have the data in a data source that Grafana can work with: mysql, postgres, influxdb, json, etc.

That sounds awesome tbh. So I guess like a dev\-specific LinkedIn type deal? I'm curious about the auto resume/CV generation.
Thanks, yeah exactly. Check out this example profile: https://able.bio/alex - if you click on the PDF icon under the name it pulls all the profile details into a CV template. It only adds your contact details (email and phone) to the CV of you are logged in and downloading your own CV.
What are you looking to get out of the dashboard? A straight up qt application would be the fastest and easiest, even though desktop apps are so passé in 2018. If it's a one off project I prefer flask over Django since the latter requires setting up a ton of stuff you don't need, and flask is much simpler. You can also use Vue/react with flask, or you just just stick with vanilla js.
I'm thinking machine learning is a better approach because it can make predictions which is important to changing the pids before the machine makes a change.
Hey, I'm in the same boat, is there a way to fix this system-wide? The same issue affects Git and Firefox.
Great info here. Thanks, I'll bring these points up on Monday 
Really liked this - clicked out of straight curiosity and ended up watching the entire 30+ min video!
same question for $PATH - the answer to these two questions will tell us what we need to know to fix

Woh, that’s awesome, now I won’t be able to stop myself from thinking of how to make my own
A visibility graph algorithm does the following: For each point of each polygon, what other points are direct line of sight visible to it? Add an edge to the visibility graph for all these visible points. You can then use this graph to find the shortest path from point a to b. This is used in path finding, AI, robotics. The simulator I made just lets you play around and see how it works interactively. I have written some blog posts on this in the past: https://taipanrex.github.io/2016/09/17/Distance-Tables-Part-1-Defining-the-Problem.html https://taipanrex.github.io/2016/10/19/Distance-Tables-Part-2-Lees-Visibility-Graph-Algorithm.html
The visibility graph algorithm is where the grunt of the work is, you can always take a look at the source code: https://github.com/TaipanRex/pyvisgraph and as I mentioned above, I have some blog posts explaining how it works.
You can download the whole site from an archive they provide. Why not just do that? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Database_download

&gt; [Namedtuple] provides the **only** super-easy framework to represent a datatype or small object I disagree here. There is also the SimpleNamespace object from the types library, which, as its name implies, is really simple. In [1]: from types import SimpleNamespace In [2]: x = SimpleNamespace() In [3]: x.hello = 1 In [4]: x Out[4]: namespace(hello=1) In [5]: x.hello Out[5]: 1 It doesn't require that "silly mandatory first argument" like Namedtuple does, but it is also not immutable. I often use it as an easy way to bundle data to be returned from a function or method.

**Slashdot effect** The Slashdot effect, also known as slashdotting, occurs when a popular website links to a smaller website, causing a massive increase in traffic. This overloads the smaller site, causing it to slow down or even temporarily become unavailable. The name stems from the huge influx of web traffic which would result from the technology news site Slashdot linking to websites. The name, however, is somewhat dated, as flash crowds from Slashdot were reported to be diminishing as of 2005 due to competition from similar sites, and the general adoption of elastically scalable cloud hosting platforms. *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Python/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28
Probably won't be accepted by the unicode consortium, because python may be regarded as a brand or product. Imagine Mcdonald having their own emoji, than would open the floodgates 
Have you considered making this into a sellable product but keeping the source available?
Yeah, I mean if PHP gets 💲 then Python should get its own emoji.
The code looks very well written and organized, clearly you put a lot of time into polishing this project and it shows! Here's some opinionated feedback: * I don't like that it installs the `la` command as a shortcut for your application. Set it as `localalias` so it matches the package on PyPI and leave it at that. It makes the documentation confusing, and `la` is already commonly used as an `ls -a...` alias on some shells. * Spend some more time refining your readme * The gif is well made, but the example alias function that you're showcasing is too arbitrary and complicated. A simple and straightforward motivating example would be good to help people understand where the application shines. * The second paragraph of the description was hard to read and took me a few passes to comprehend. It would be more cohesive if the example matched the one in the gif. * The TLDR at the bottom would actually work as a great tagline at the top of the readme. * The whole concept of per\-directory aliases sounds like a Makefile. You could map `r` as an alias for` make ru`n, and then create a Makefile in the project directory that defines what` make ru`n does. That would accomplish essentially the same thing, right?
LoL... OP: " I need help deciding how to productively spend my time." You: "BUILD ME AN EVERQUEST BOT TO HELP ME POWER LEVEL!" :P

I used the following example to get around this issue, although I can't recommend anyone use it. (using the newer pypi) pip install --trusted-host pypi.org --trusted-host files.pythonhosted.org &lt;package_name&gt;
Unfortunately, the only way way to fix this system-wide is for your company to stop perpetrating man-in-the-middle attacks on its own employees. The issue, as described above, is that your company has its own CA cert which they use to sign the connection between you and the proxy. Since this cert isn't in the default trusted certificate lists that come with various software packages, it needs to be added to those lists. Your company has added this to certain lists, such as the one(s) used by Windows and Chrome, but other software packages, such as Firefox, come with their own separate list of trusted certs. Each of these has to be updated separately. In some cases you may have a direct or indirect choice of trusted cert lists for a package. For example, Git for Windows [can be configured](https://stackoverflow.com/a/46332681) to use the MinGW OpenSSL library or the native Windows Secure Channel library. Each library has its own trusted certificate list and the latter may have your company's cert installed by the admins.
Pretty sure this is a reference to reddit's april fools day event which redditors were tricked into thinking it was snek related and people started spamming snek &amp; that emoji.
It still needs lot more features to be added to make it into a sellable product, but I want to keep this free anyways. I would like to accept donations but only after I think it has enough features. The source will ALWAYS be available.

How is anything supposed to progress if people demand backwards compatibility? Do you know how much that limits developers?
If you haven't used `attrs` before I recommend you try it. I use it in all my projects now, it does everything dataclasses do and more, and does not require Python 3.7. They also iterate faster since they don't have to wait more than a year to push new features.
Why did you think I was criticizing anything? 
Interesting idea, I never thought of that! BTW, do you know if it's possible to transfer the data from the RPi to the Mac without using the internet?
Are you saying that I can plug the DHT22 sensor directly into the esp8266/esp32 wifi module, without having to use a Raspberry Pi? I'm very new to this, so I am having trouble wrapping my head around how a wifi module can process data from the sensor?
Hello! Site looks great! I am learning Django myself and it is inspiring. Thanks! I signed up a few minutes ago and am waiting for the confirmation link email. _(waiting)_
wheatdog No quite exactly. I want to achieve what [sacred](https://github.com/IDSIA/sacred/) did. For example, following is my project structure. ``` . ├── dataset │ ├── __init__.py │ └── mnist.py └── train.py ``` In train.py, I have something like `from dataset import MNIST`, and `MNIST` is a class defined in `dataset/mnist.py`. I would like to have a way to track all the dependency files train.py need. In this case, it is `dataset/__init__.py` and `dataset/mnist.py`.
What about navigating to `site-packages`, finding the directory / archive of `docutils` and simply deleting it?
&gt; why are there so many frameworks for taking things that would ordinarily be dictionaries and making their 'keys' available as attributes? Well, here's your confusion. Those wouldn't be dictionaries. A much more efficient way to implement attribute access is to have the underlying data-structure be a struct. I.e. your language compiler / interpreter will know that when you do `Foo.bar` it needs to translate it into `memory of Foo at offset defined by bar`. This works faster, and especially so for small objects. This also uses less memory (hash-tables need more memory because to live up to their theoretical properties they need to have about 20-30% of empty space, they also use complex internal data-structures: typically an array containing doubly-linked lists, which naturally comes with a memory bill).
By correcting before a deviation from the target steady state, you will probably introduce system instability. In my opinion, prediction should happen at a higher level than the PID.

i'm trying to make a GUI that saves files and can only be opend by a specific username, password and location basically it is a location based encryption program. 
The current mouse selection *anywhere* on the desktop is usually the domain of your *windows manager* and *desktop manager*... on Windows and Mac those are sort of (but not exactly) the same thing, on Linux it could be a whole mess of different setups. I'm not aware of a single, cross platform way to do this... I've seen some tools that do this in GTK specifically, but IIRC they relied on lib calls in GTK that listened directly to X events, so I doubt they'd even work with, for instance, Wayland. Plus this was years ago at a company I no longer work for. In normal operation GUI toolkits like tkinter allow you to only talk to windows in your own process directly; so you can get the selection in any widget you control easy enough, but not widgets running in another process. For that you'd need some form of Inter Process Communication (IPC), but that's going back to being pretty dependent on the environment in use.
Oh hi Mark 
It uses combination of async/await and concurrent.futures. Strategy is somewhat similar to that of [requests-futures](https://github.com/ross/requests-futures), but I came to know about requests-futures much later on halfway through the project. However, I think that api of vinanti is much easier to deal with compared to requests-futures. In normal async code, as soon as event loop starts, main thread gets blocked. I wanted to get over that limitation, and callback is most preferred way to do that. Maybe it is possible to implement entire thing with just plain threads (without async/await/futures), but I don't know. I'll look into it.

A different name for `groupby` might have been a good idea, but the horse has already left the stable. There is a hint in the fully-qualified name: `itertools.groupby`. There's no way to _iteratively_ group the data. That's why the whole pre-sorting is distasteful. It's double-handling the data unnecessarily.
Github.
Pre-existing work experience. 
There isn't but Python Foundation should create one. They are in the best position to provide this accreditation, and apart from the pythonistas getting a way to show their credentials to a client or employer, the PSF will also have a way to earn some income.
I had to google to find out what a NEET is. And yeah, unfortunately for you, there are no guarantees when it comes to salaries. The best way is to develop a good work ethic, work on prijects, and constantly improve yourself. There aren't many shortcuts with this, I'm araid, because you are competing in the job market with others who are doing the same. Except for absolute entry-level jobs, most employers care more about experience than qualification anyway. They would rather you show them a great portfolio that you worked hard on, than some accreditation that they've probably not heard of. 
I believe Qt has a DnD option, though it may be complicated. Another option is turning your project into a webapp.
I'd recommend PyQT5. Look up some tutorials for it. It's very good, has a drag and drop editor, and is easy to learn. 
Thank you so much for your videos. They helped me come up and going with pandas. 
I don't think that's a proper hint though. Nothing about it being itertools says it has to return iterators and do things iteratively-- hell, look at the "rough equivalent" to `itertools.tee`. In that way, if the horse hadn't yet left the stable, and this were being done from the beginning, this function should have been named differently, and `groupby` instead either doing what I mentioned above about the pre sorting or the probably algorithmically better def groupby(iterable, key=None): key = key or (lambda i: i) pool = defaultdict(list) # starting in 3.6 dicts are ordered, so so must default dicts. In previous version a subclass of ordered and default dicts woukd be required for item in iterable: pool[key(item)].append(item) return iter(pool.items())
That's wonderful! I wrote one of those last week for my projects, they're really fun even if they don't work super well!
I'm glad to see you're still working on your project! How smoothly is it going despite finding Vagrant this far in?

Is there a specific reason you want to do this in Python? There's pretty good standard open source software for this kind of thing, eg tcpdump and/or Wireshark.
Okk
But can it be possible in Python ??
No just for fun
Of course it is. But it's much more work, why do it if there's excellent free software for it?
Honestly I don't know about Wireshark or tcpdump is there is any course about either of them so i can master them ?
There is immense documentation for Wireshark and tcpdump. A simple search for 'tcpdump examples' will yeild endless results. If you must do this in python, you'd probably be looking at the scapy module. But as it was suggested earlier, this is much more difficult
Look at the source code for the ssl module. There was some env variable you can set to specify the default CA store.

Healthcare is a big deal, and just 'throwing ML' at the problem isn't something that's useful. A twitter bot can mess up, but the cost of a false negative or false positive in healthcare can be huge. In some cases it can actually mean life or death for multiple people (especially when time is a factor). Before a technology is widely implemented in healthcare it goes through a host of trials to make sure that the technology works, and when it does fail (because it will) it fails as safely as possible. That takes time. Any given ML program needs to be tested and understood before it's implemented in sensitive scenarios otherwise it's simply unethical. Theranos is a prime example of what happens when you ignore proper testing in favor of implementing "THE solution" without understanding the implications. (Ok to be fair, theranos is a prime example of a lot of terrible things, but among them is not understanding the limitations and failure conditions of a new technology). As /u/ubernostrum pointed out, python doesn't necessarily equal machine learning. And not seeing 'ML' emerge in the sector doesn't mean it isn't a huge area in the field. I do bioinformatics research and python, c++, R, c, and increasingly go, are all popular languages of choice in academia. Looking at industry, any given language a company uses is largely dependant on who is working in that company and what they know. The next requirement is that the language they're using to is able to solve their problems and make their job easier. If there are lots of academic uses of python, there will be lots of people in industry using it. But it'll take time for modern cutting edge machine learning methodologies to be implement in an average health care scenario. The big issue is: does a given language provide you with the flexibility to solve a problem given the constraints of the system. Python is flexible and in most use cases except for maybe threading and speed python's ease of use makes it one of the best languages to use in health-care focused problems. Even in those cases python can still be one of the best languages of choice, you just have to learn some hidden tricks of the language to optimize it. After that, the big thing you need to learn is how to manipulate information. Every programming language boils down to that concept. Break a problem down into small parts, and manipulate the data you're given to get the data you need. Learning programming is really about learning a methodology, and languages are just ways to implement it. You will always be able to learn the syntax of another language should some job require you too. My opinion is this: Python is useful in healthcare, and will become increasingly used. Just because you don't see the field embracing convolutional neural networks and LSTM systems doesn't mean it's not being worked on, it just means we're in the "OK What happens if I do this" phase. The sector wants success, it's just aware of the cost of failure. Python will be useful (and I'd argue currently is) in this sector. And if you end up in a job where you're not using python, you'll still be using the methodology to problem solving you learned while learning python

LLVM isn't easy to work with at first glance, but there's some good tutorial material out there for Pythonistas. A couple of people have taken the LLVM "Kaleidoscope" tutorial and adopted it to Python: [https://github.com/frederickjeanguerin/pykaleidoscope](https://github.com/frederickjeanguerin/pykaleidoscope) [https://github.com/eliben/pykaleidoscope](https://github.com/eliben/pykaleidoscope) I used the above as the basis for my own language project: [https://github.com/syegulalp/Akilang](https://github.com/syegulalp/Akilang) I can also recommend a tutorial to create a little C\-like language, again using llvmlite and Python: [https://github.com/paivett/gone](https://github.com/paivett/gone)
Wtf is wrong with have you. Going to school isn't about "sucking dick". I don't know why wannabes think they could spend a couple weeks learning a.language and *poof* they are a rockstar. You can't do that and the assumption is a slap in the face.to those.of us who put in the work and education. Stop trying to shortcut everything. If.you have.anxiety over.your.finances and want to get into software, start with an associate's degeee to get some training.
Looks like polygon modeling 
I don't really understand the hoopla over attrs. I've tried.to get on board a few times.buts for me it's always been a solution to a nonproblem. It.neber made.my code cleaner or shorter in aeaningful way.
Looks pretty sweet
Your app will have to hook into the accessibility interface of the app whose text is being translated. Search for "Linux accessibility interfaces" on Google for more information. Pretty much any programming language on Linux can access those.
Oh God. Search the python bytes podcast for so many options (none of them ideal)
Looks like that reverses rows. You can use reset_index(drop=True) in the second line.
PyQt has been very good to me.
What happened with pip10? All I know is pip stopped working for me and after a series of incantations/upgrades/downgrades I got it to work again.
Another vote for wireshark as it's likely a good idea. That win said we made one with a highly talented programmer who made one using: c, selenium, scrapy, beautiful soup, python and we leave it running while surfing but 80 to 90 % of the data it catches is so meta it gets deleted. Maybe narrow your field of view for smaller data collection.
I'm sure you're biased by the fact you own a degree/title and the idea of it being useless is too much for you. A lot of people have done great things without titles: Elon Musk, Bill Gates, Steve Jobs... Yeah, I may not be as smart as them, but I least I want to be myself instead of being "normal".
Once, I met a guy who worked that way, he didn't tell much about it but it seemed he was able to earn a living... 
They aren't norm at all lol. They were successful busjnessmen not programmers. You'd probably want to mention someone like Kenneth Reitz or Zuckerberg to try and sound lime you know what you're talking about. But no, I'm not biased by having a degree, I'm informed by it. I goty degree late in life and have seen booths.sides I'd this while you are being a George Costnza about your life trying to shortxut your way into something you aren't nearly qualified for.go watch your youtube videos on python and blog tutorials champ ... I'm sure you'll be a shining star in a few more weeks.
Well, even if it was impossible, it worths trying it. That's how Mankind evolves, trial and error. If I die, at least I've tried to live my way: I'm gonna die anyways... Imagine if Columbus never risked his life to discover America...
even if it's impossible it's worth trying? Literally the opposite but ok. I didn't realize you were just trolling.
You can't tell if something is impossible if you don't even try.
Yes you can. Self sabatoge and making excuses for why you're not going to improve yourself won't work. Just a hunch.
Not currently but we are working on something. It's such a new language that things have grown so fast that keeping up is a challenge.
How about: your_dataframe = your_dataframe[your_dataframe.columns[::-1]] 
Ah, you're the kind of person sure of what other should do since others are telling you what to do since you don't have a clue about who you are.
Never ask, "Can it be done this way?". If time, cost and scope are infinite, the answer is always yes. Therefore a better question is, "Should it be done this way?".
If you want a near guarantee get an AWS cert then get more.
I'd agree, PyQt is great. If you're looking for help online though, don't search for PyQt, since most of the docs are in C\+\+. Instead, search for PySide. It's nearly identical, but the docs have Python code in the examples.
Thanks, I just watched a couple of those and got some decent clarification on things I'd already been using but with no real expertise :)
Sure, for instance if you get a Bluetooth adapter for both machines you can transfer data with Bluetooth, However that requires them to be close to each other. Depending on what you mean by internet, I'd suggest the easiest way to transfer the data is through the local network (i.e. not reaching out to other servers on the external network, just transferring data between two computers in your local network) You can do this many ways: SSH, FTP, SMB, SCP, etc... There's plenty of YouTube videos showing for to do this 
Thanks dude! It’s my first package for Python. I did realize late last night that I forgot one function in the README so I gotta fix that 😬
This post is better suited for r/learnpython 
wx is pretty easily to learn if you're familiar with OOP. No drag and drop that I'm aware of, but placement with horizontal and vertical sizers is incredibly easy. 
Hi to you as well! It's actually Kevin Markham, but no worries, hundreds of people have made that same mistake because of my last name :\)
Awesome! So glad to hear that these videos have been helpful to you! I actually have a new video series that might interest you, [Best practices with pandas](http://www.dataschool.io/best-practices-with-pandas/), which is basically an edited version of my 3\-hour pandas tutorial from the PyCon 2018 conference.
You are very welcome!
Sweet! I tried to structure this video series so that individual lessons of interest are easy to find, and you don't have to watch the entire series. Glad that worked for you!
I'm working on a video that showcases a collection of user\-submitted pandas tricks... feel free to submit [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxrGx8cPJlQ) if you're interested in contributing!
My wife is a structural engineer at a large firm and I pitched the idea of doing some python automation for her. She and her coworkers were appalled by the suggestion and said there was no way that I could automate something so complicated as their work flows. Much eye rolling ensued. 
I think BDFL would be that title.
*facepalm*
Dict keys can be much more than what your dotted access can handle in the language. Think a while on complications in accessing `my_dict["string with spaces"]`; or `my_dict[hashable_class]`. 
If you want to build a value object, it's a life saver. It handles the init, repr, can make it comparable, hashable, frozen. If you need a default value like a list, you can handle that in a sane, safe way rather than doing None checking in the init. If you only used attrs for handling the init method, I can see why you wouldn't want to take it on. But it's great once you hand over a bunch of boiler plate generation to it. 
In their latest incarnations both pyqt and pyside refer directly to the c++ docs Other than signals, slots and variants, there's not much difference between qt in C++ and Python to be honest. Most people should be able to read the c++ examples and infer it even if they don't know the language.
OVH has cheap VPS.
The “data catching” you’re talking about is called “sniffing”. You absolutely can do that in Python using the `socket` module. You’ll need to run the script with admin (aka root) privileges, though. 
Perfect timing. Thank you for posting this. I came here to ask a question about this exact topic, now I’m going to watch these first. Before I go though... I’ve never used pandas. I’m a mechanical engineer with some experience in Python, but I’m no expert. I have datasets containing telemetry from some testing I’m doing, which has a very high sampling rate. Basically, I’m sampling 40 data points 500 times per second, for multiple minutes, so I’m winding up with files up to around a GB. I’m trying to write a script to plot the data, but the only method I’ve ever used (matplotlib) is extremely slow. Is pandas the right way to go for something like this?
Namedtuples are not what you think they are. Unlike pre-3.7 dicts, they're ordered; they can be instantiated without defining the keys every time; they can be unpacked; they're immutable; and they're hashable. While dicts can contain different types, there usually isn't any need to, where that's pretty much the entire point of tuples, named or otherwise. As others have pointed out, dicts are more flexible than Boxes because only certain strings can be used as a Box key, but anything hashable can be used as a dict key.
&gt; none of them ideal I love listening to that podcast, but I find hilarious how many GUIs there are and how we don't have an ideal one
I did learn a lot with your videos. Thanks you! 
Feel free to grab it, I'm too lazy to submit it :-)
you can probably do something like this: def fun(styleString, startNum): if (“cls-“ + str(startNum)) in styleString: return styleString[styleString.find(startNum):] else: return “” I don’t see a need to (imo) overcomplicate this by using a regex
It took me a few reads of your post to figure out what your question was but I think I've got it. I personally would split the style string, doing something like this `style.split(".cls-")[1:]` (to get rid of the empty string at element 0). Then I'd use enumerate and go through the resulting list, making new strings with the indices you want, and `''.join` the result. For example: def reindex_style(style, starting_idx=0): items = style.split('.cls-')[1:] reindexed_items = ['.cls-{}'.format(idx) + item[-15:] for idx, item in enumerate(items, starting_idx+1)] return ''.join(reindexed_items)
Isn't that just a simple proxy server? There are ton of example code out there. You just have to change your browser's proxy setting to the new proxy server.
pandas is fast for in-memory data sources, since you have a gb of data and most newer machines run ~16gb memory you should be ok. As for time series, check out the [resample](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.resample.html?highlight=resample) method.
I made a partial port of [WanaKana](https://github.com/WaniKani/WanaKana) which helps with Japanese text identification, called [WanaKanaPython](https://github.com/luke-c/WanaKanaPython). It's also on [pip](https://pypi.org/project/wanakana/)! This is my first real Python (and pip) usage so any critique would be welcomed :)
It seems that your comment contains 1 or more links that are hard to tap for mobile users. I will extend those so they're easier for our sausage fingers to click!

Mechanical engineers think 500 Hz is fast ;-) Sure it's 40 channels, but still basically DC. 
Haha, hey cut me some slack! I thought I was doing well just googling to find out about pandas!! :)
Ok. And what part is giving you trouble? What have you tried that isn't working like you expect?
I found these to be the easiest to use: https://srinikom.github.io/pyside-docs/PySide/QtGui/index.html They're a bit outdated in a few places, but overall very helpful.
A note on matplot lib: Matplotlib has 2 user interfaces, A matlab like \(slow\) and a object oriented \(much faster\) If that does not work, I have had pretty good luck with pyqtgraph in the past. However the support is tiny vs matplotlib. \(Also I believe the creator has moved on\)
&gt; Is there any softwares that has a drag and drop thing for it Look into Qt Designer. It allows you to drag and drop various widgets and layouts and arrange them together, as well as change most of their properties, e.g. button text, icon, number of columns in a tree, etc. You can use it with PyQt5 or PySide2. PyQt5 is better, but has problematic licensing. If you don't care about licensing you should use PyQt5. 
Yea just have your python script call wireshark or tcpdump.
Doesn't python use an internal dict representation anyway? I'm not sure on the internals.
Don't understand question Security company == ?
Beware though. It works great under GNU but installing it under windows is a pure nightmare.
`pip install pyqt5` should work -- there are wheels with Qt built in for Windows, Linux, and Mac. Need Python 3.5+ though. If stuck on 2.7 or something, conda is another option.
you have to match versions by hand
Moving my old mp3 into Spotify playlists and having a go at that API for the first time. Hope most of the confusion are behind me now so the rest can be smooth sailing.

Hi Mark, I started straight away with Spark and have never known a time before DataFrames (such as RDD). What incentive is there for me to learn Pandas? I very rarely work with an amount of data that will fit on my machine, and if I do, I have Zeppelin + Spark running in a Docker container that I use locally for POC before spinning up a full cluster for the production-grade Jobs. 
Looking into PyQT and seems like this will do the work for me. Thanks!
Although I concur on using Qt to a certain extent, I encourage you to try GTK3 \(if you're using linux, otherwise it's hell on earth\). You can create the interface with Glade, then link the functions
I'm pretty much certain that nowadays you can just pip install pyqt5 on a fresh Windows machine with Python 3.5+ installed and be up and running. I don't work with Windows much, but I just did this a couple weeks ago. Check it out by downloading a wheel from PyPI (https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/#files), unzipping it, and browsing to the Qt binaries (PyQt5/Qt/lib).
An intersting option! I'll think about that. Thanks!
I've also set my DNS in /etc/resolv.conf to [1.1.1.1](https://1.1.1.1) \(has made not difference \)

&gt; PyQt is a set of Python v2 and v3 bindings C++ lib must be installed.
This is great, thank you.
+1 for pyqtgraph! That's what I use for interactive plotting where matplotlib is too slow for good interactivity. There are also plenty of others like bokeh, Altair, bqplot, toyplot, vispy, etc. For a very quick overview of all the tools and how they relate check out this video: https://youtu.be/FytuB8nFHPQ.
Ok, great, thanks for the definitioin of PyQt. But I'm telling you (and you can check for yourself), the C++ lib is packaged in the wheel that is downloaded from PyPI and it is installed in site-packages. Here's an announcement from the mailing list from when they were first trying out this idea. https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/pipermail/pyqt/2016-April/037217.html The caveat about the wheels being too large for PyPI is no longer the case, so it has been trivial to install PyQt5 **with Qt** for a while now.
Have a look at Revit Python Shell https://github.com/architecture-building-systems/revitpythonshell
Elon Musk did formally study engineering. And Bill Gates and Zuckerberg dropped out of Harvard in order to launch cutting edge tech. They did not get careers they founded companies. So if that is what you are trying to do innovate then. But if you want a career or to be taken seriously in any means go to school.

I'm working on getting the code for a screen-ruler program that I made in `tkinter` restructured. A typical workflow of mine involves setting a PDF file to 100% zoom, then noting down measurements from it in points using a screen ruler. Unfortunately, the package I typically used had some incompatibilities with my system ruby libraries, so I ended up rolling my own. I'm fairly satisfied with it on the whole, it works with python 3.5 and has support for measuring in pixels, points, em, inches, millimeters, and pica. If anyone wants to try it out, here's the [github](https://github.com/aggerdom/screenruler). It currently runs using `python3 -m screenruler.main`, from the parent directory, but working on getting that fixed up this weekend. 
Hi Carl. 
Have a look on scrapy, or Portia if you wanna a GUI to identify how to do it the user-friendly way before coding
Dunno anything about enaml or beeware, but Kivy is not good.
Not the overlord of syntax errors, but merely 300 simple errors wrapped in not-so-safe threads.
I think i remember the author explaining the project at Pydata 2013 in New york!
Good job. The code looks overcomplicated though, and the style is inconsistent. It's also hard to take a project seriously with a `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` 
I disagree with the code of conduct statement, I work with a org that helps people transition from military to software. We have repos that we encourage people to contribute to. We have a code of conduct that indicates you should respect contributors of any skill level and help them. 
Nice, I'll check it out when I get a chance.
From the (very brief) reading I did, Enaml just looks like a wrapper for Qt's QML language. QML is way more superior than Kivy, with the only caveat being it's JS based instead of Python. But, it was built by Qt to specifically run on mobile. So when I was testing out QML, I'd write the program in QML, compile it in Python to test how everything worked. Using PyQt5 to test your QML is much faster than building each project in Qt Creator. And when everything works out well enough, you can just move your files to your Qt Creator C++ project pretty seamlessly.
Damn hipsters and their "async" frameworks.
If all lines are in that format, there will be some shortcuts. If not, which I assume is the case, or you would not be asking, there is regex.
I am genuinely curious, what file format is that?

Regular expressions might be the best way to go here.
[SimpleNamespace](https://docs.python.org/3/library/types.html?highlight=types#types.SimpleNamespace) might do what you’re looking for. 
I started using backported dataclasses, and switched back to attrs. The factory syntactic sugar with the `attr.ib` took away the verbose annoyance. It is just my default method of starting classes now. 
Maybe. I'll have to try it out. Thanks! 
Take a look at this project boilerplate (https://github.com/wdm0006/cookiecutter-pipproject). Using it, all you need to do is add your code.
You might want to look into data classes which are new in python 3.7 (available soon). They are meant for this exact problem (a lighter weight solution to using a class for data)
https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/1956/generate-the-longest-error-message-in-c

GDPR.. is this the European privacy thing that has been rolling out? Heard about it from the `python-bytes` podcast.. seems like everybody has to now change their websites to address this.. Must be a big headache..

Otherwise frequently the pain becomes greater than the benefit. Because there are always unknown hickups and unpredictable things that you didnt know you are going to be facing down the road..

Are you sure Matlab doesn't provide GPU acceleration: https://www.mathworks.com/discovery/matlab-gpu.html? I have used Matlab quite a bit in my Grad School and now using Python full time. For sure a lot of the open-source ML code is written for Python.. but the underlying code behind the `pythonic` interface is actually in C or C++. So you can probably do the same in Matlab as well... Unless you are also trying to learn Python on the way.. Which is actually a great way to do so.. as well.
You're very welcome!

pandas is designed for in\-memory use, and so it sounds like it's not a good fit for your workflow.
This post is better suited for r/learnpython 
thanks! love what you’re doing for the community. 
It's far better than it was even a couple of years ago. I started developing on Windows because it was an environment I was comfortable with, so I guess out of that came my willingness to make whatever concessions I needed. But as time goes on I don't need to make anywhere nearly as many concessions! 
Awesome series! I would add that you can also do axis='index' or axis='columns' instead of axis=0|1. This is something I wish most tutorials would mention since not everyone looking to learn pandas already has numpy background.
Why not giving [PyFladesk](https://github.com/smoqadam/PyFladesk) a try?
Thank you. It was resolved. I appreciate it.
This seems appropriate... Here's a snippet for OP from collections import namedtuple Settings = namedtuple('Settings', 'setting1 setting2 setting3') settings = Settings( setting1=10, setting2=20, setting3=30) print(settings.setting1) try: settings.setting1 = 'new value' except: print('The tuple is immutable, whoda thunk it.')
40 data points times 500 times per second times 180 seconds is about 3,600,000 million data points. You could probably just sample 10,000 out of those and get a plot that would look pretty close or nearly identical to the full plot, maybe minus a few outliers. 
Normally I would agree, but the application here is a motor controller that has a very sensitive control scheme, times 4 motors, and the 40 data points are all important pieces of telemetry. So there’s not a ton of opportunity for downsampling without risking missing something important. I wound up using pandas for one of the smaller datasets with around 1million points, and it seemed to work pretty well, and much faster than matplotlib. Now I just need to learn to make the plots look better. The videos are also quite good and helpful. 
You are doing very well! My sister is mech and I'm electronic eng so the banter is non stop. I couldn't help myself ;-) She also recently picked up python, the next step is pandas.

Nice, but I only see 40 :)
This was an interesting and fun problem. I thought a regex substitution would be a decent solution and it turns out you can pass a function to re.sub. The downside to it is that the signature for the function passed to re.sub looks like it only has the match. However, a closure worked for passing a "global" around that doesn't need to be public. import re def update_styles(style_string, offset): exp = r'(\.cls-\s?)(\d+)({fill:#[0-9a-f]+;})' def my_replace(m): new_value = str(int(m.group(2)) + offset) return m.group(1) + new_value + m.group(3) return re.sub(exp, my_replace, style_string) new_string = update_styles(your_string, 14)
I like kivy but I think the building process is kind of hackish and unintuitive for someone like me who's not into coding professionally. 
&gt;It's also hard to take a project seriously with a CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md Many people won't work on a project if there isn't a code if conduct. Furthermore, what's wrong with putting in writing expectations of civility? 
For tuples? No, it uses an array. There's a problem with classes though. Normally, you'd want them to be structured the same as tuples, but because Python allows users to add properties at run time, it chose to have a dictionary for such cases. That's not the smartest move, it was, probably, easiest to implement. I remember when Google came up with V8 (the Node.js JavaScript implementation), they devised a better scheme for dynamic objects: they'd just keep generating new classes with the required number of slots every time the slot was created, relying on the fact that people rarely use this feature. But they since then improved on this strategy, and don't do this anymore. Other languages which also have objects that can gain slots dynamically at run time usually solve this problem w/o using dictionaries too. Say, in CLOS you would have to re-define a class to make that work, but that's totally possible to do at run time.

Can you not just write a short code of conduct in the readme?
There are games such as Coding Planets on Android that help teach basic coding concepts like functions and loops. Others focus on algorithms. Learn Python by SoloLearn is a good app specific to python. There are plenty of really good apps to help learn Python specifically or programming concepts in general, and to get you to just start thinking like a programmer. 
It would be easier to make a phone app that translated text captured with the camera. See what /u /yawpitch writes.
Just a simple question. Pandas can't be used to, say, maintain the data if a feature class? My understanding is that it basically takes a copy of the data and processes that but never writes back to the source. Is that write ?
Excuse my ignorance. But isnt the request (with headers) available to you already by the time your jwt code gets hit? I fail to see why/how async would make this any faster.
Iterate over a the string, look for numbers and periods. Have a little buffer var that gets numbers or periods appended. Whenever main loop sees a non-number/period, check isnum on the buffer and then float it if was a number.
There is a very beginner friendly app called SoloLearn (Web, Android and IOS). Perfect for people just getting into programming. The community is helpful and there are dozens of cool little challenges to do every week or so.
I use % for two main reasons. Familiarity and terseness. Not just terse, but able to wrap. Compare: s = ('blah blah blah %f blah blah blah' % (math.pi)) vs s = 'blah blah blah blah blah {0} blah blah blah'.format(math.pi) Where can I put a linebreak in there? That said, I like the ability of `.format()` to use named values, so I have been using it for some light string templating recently.
Firstly, you can write e. g. {0:.2f} to specify a float with 2 decimals, see e. g. https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-string-formatters-in-python-3 Secondly, the best formatting method is f-strings, see e. g. https://www.blog.pythonlibrary.org/2018/03/13/python-3-an-intro-to-f-strings/
.format I experimented with f strings but they did not make me comfortable. They're a little too implicit for my liking.
+1 for f-strings!
I don't understand the requirements. If you just want all the numbers, it's a very simple regular expression to just match on digits found \(\\d\+\) : [https://regex101.com/r/keXnmr/1](https://regex101.com/r/keXnmr/1) . Then with Python "re" standard library you get all the match groups as a list of strings. \(look up the docs: [https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html) \)
How is .format any better when it comes to cohesion in that case?
I get the impression you're quite new to python but you can do this s = ('blah blah blah blah blah {} blah blah blah' .format(math.pi)) And everyone will understand what's going on. Even better, in python 3.6 you can just do s = f'blah blah blah blah blah {math.pi} blah blah blah' And you could always do named arguments like so "%(name)s's number is %(num).2f" % dict(name="Ben", num=math.pi) What you can't do is explained well here: https://pyformat.info/#named_placeholders For these reasons `%` formatting is considered deprecated and you should use f-strings for normal formatting and `.format` for template formatting. 
&gt; Where can I put a linebreak in there? s = ('blah blah blah blah blah {0} blah blah blah' .format(math.pi)) or s = 'blah blah blah blah blah {0} blah blah blah'.format( math.pi)
I concat strings with +. It'll be a cold day in hell before anyone can stop me.
Since f strings have the same\* syntax as `.format` then they will always have exactly 6 less characters... \* ^(you must put quotes around string indexes)
or a MemoryError
Wait...you can break on a `.`??
A lot of my code looks like this, where the processed variable is directly tied to the string: myformattedmessage = "{} blah {} blah blah".format( method(myvar.prop).xyz, anothermethod(anothervar.prop1.childprop).anothermethod("xyz"), ) The thing that concerns me about f strings is that they could end up like this: var1 = method(myvar.prop).xyz var2 = anothermethod(anothervar.prop1.childprop).anothermethod("xyz") [ 30 lines of code ] var = somethingelseagain.the_developer_might_not_see_this_line_of_code_and_only_change_the_above_one [ 20 lines of code ] myformattedmessage = f"{var1} blah {var2} blah blah"
If you use parentheses, yes :)
Wouldn't you just put those variables together anyway, if it's possible to inline them in the call to .format?
f strings require you to define the variable though. .format doesn't. In my example above, the f string version has variables var1 and var2 while .format has no defined variables.
Can you give an example?
Huh? f-strings allow arbitrary code execution f'this equals 5: {1 + 2**2}'
Pff. Real pythonistas use ''.join(itertools.chain('hello ', name, ', you are ', [age], ' years old.'))
Ok, you *can* but I wouldn't do arbitrary code execution inside of a string. The code example I gave in this thread.
Of course, it's just an operator (which ignore whitespace). `x . y ()` is valid python. 
Yes, f strings are great, but only if you can guarantee your program will only run on 3.6+
Why? The core devs specifically worked to make it that way for a reason: it's really bloody useful. 
Currently watching sentdex's beginner's videos. They've been incredibly helpful and get straight to the point about what you do and why you do it. Last night I tried to make a program that takes user input to determine if nutrition macros are being if hit. Used nothing but if statement's and it works perfectly (except for the calorie bit which I asses if due more to the large amount of if statements). Point being that I actually feel I am progressing even though I know barely anything. Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVp1vrfL_w4&amp;index=1&amp;list=PLQVvvaa0QuDe8XSftW-RAxdo6OmaeL85M
A more direct replacement to your .format\-example with f\-strings would be to place var1 and var2 directly above myformattedmessage, not to have 20\-30 lines of code between each of them var1 = method(myvar.prop).xyz var2 = anothermethod(anothervar.prop1.childprop).anothermethod("xyz") myformattedmessage = f"{var1} blah {var2} blah blah" I see your point regarding reuse of temporary variables and other bad practices, but that kinda applies in every situation where you are using variables, I don't think it's a drawback of f\-strings in particular. If you have long calculations **and** you want to avoid storing them in temporary variables, I agree .format is better since you can do line breaks and comments and stuff.
I prefer to keep a strict separation of concerns between logic and presentation- even when it's just a simple string. This is one of the things that drew me to the django philosophy: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/misc/design-philosophies/#separate-logic-from-presentation I dunno, perhaps I'm overreacting but I still get nightmares from maintaining smushed presentation and controller logic in PHP from 2004.
In the example pydry gave, the equivalent f\-string without temporary variables looks pretty bad myformattedmessage = f"{method(myvar.prop).xyz} blah {anothermethod(anothervar.prop1.childprop).anothermethod('xyz')} blah blah"
Oh I see. Yeah, that's what I meant about this not being a problem if you maintain strict discipline. However, in practice I think in a lot of cases they would drift upwards - it's something I can see happening incrementally without any one person doing anything very wrong. As @XtremeGoose rightly pointed out you can avoid this by putting the calculation in the string itself but that approach doesn't really make me comfortable either: myformattedmessage = f"{method(myvar.prop).xyz} blah {anothermethod(anothervar.prop1.childprop).anothermethod("xyz")} blah blah"
I agree in that specific case when the code is particularly verbose I would either use variables or `.format` for readability. But its not an argument to forgo f-strings in their entirety. f"{colvec.T} is all positive: {(colvec &gt; 0).all()}" for example is nicer in my option that the equivilent `.format` call.
I tend to use .format or f-strings for "technical" formatting as I find them more readable and somewhat more reliable: because the arguments-passing is very explicit there's no risk of passing a single tuple-parameter or dict-parameter and having everything blow up for instance. I also find str.format much clearer for named parameters: "foo {a} {b}".format(a=42, b=63) versus "foo %(a)s %(b)s" % {'a': 42, 'b': 63} **However** when it comes to translatable strings f-strings are simply unusable and .format is way too powerful (it allows arbitrary attribute and item access) and a bit too finicky to give to "random" translators, so printf-style it is. Translators can (and do) regularly fuck up but it's much harder to be malicious. That's too bad too, because format strings have the advantage of being indexable (e.g. you can use "{1} {0}") whereas printf-style requires named parameters. On the other hand, named parameters are much clearer when there are multiple parameters anyway, translating "Adding {0} to {1}" is meaningless, translating "Adding {expense_name} to {account_name}" is much clearer. &gt; There are two ways of string formatting in python There are three: the older printf-style (`%`), the newer format (`str.format`) and the newest f-strings. &gt; "Today is {0}.".format(datetime.now()) # 2018-06-03 16:50:35.226194 The index is unnecessary. If you want to be explicit i suggest formatting by name. &gt; The only problem I'd imagine would be when you have to deal with long floats: You can add format specifiers between the braces of .format or f-strings: https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#formatspec
But you'll have to `str()` convert too many variables such as ints, floats, datetimes, etc., so isn't that both tedius and less efficient?
&gt; Where can I put a linebreak in there? s = 'blah blah blah blah blah {0} blah blah blah'.format( math.pi) &gt; That said, I like the ability of .format() to use named values, so I have been using it for some light string templating recently. printf-style has the same capability: you pass in a dict (instead of a tuple) and provide the dict keys in parens between the % and the format specifier: s = 'blabla %(thing)s' % {'thing': math.pi'}
I think that's fair, but I'd also like to point out that this is also a Django philosophy &gt; Django apps should use as little code as possible; they should lack boilerplate So "{key} : {value}".format(key=self.key, value=self.value) or something more realistic would break said philosophy. 
Yep, and also have to use single quotes around that xyz to avoid a syntax error :P
&gt; For these reasons % formatting is considered deprecated and you should use f-strings for normal formatting and .format for template formatting. Except neither work for translatable data: f-string plain does not work (there's no runtime hook) and format strings provide way too much power (arbitrary item and attribute access) to allow untrusted format-string injections.
Or suppress the newline with a `\`.
Yes, but: 1. you have to use a `\` to "suppress" the statements-ending of the newline 2. or you have to be in a context where the current statement *can not* legally end e.g. within braces, parens or brackets
&gt;this is also a Django philosophy Yes, absolutely. Whenever I write *any* code I'm usually trying to balance 'write the least boilerplate', cohesion, coupling and language complexity. It's very common that things that improve in one area are detrimental in another. &gt;would break said philosophy. Well sure, but you wrote a bunch of unnecessary characters there. If I saw that I'd instantly rewrite it to be this: "{} : {}".format(self.key, self.value)
Frankly you shouldn't be using `%` for that either. You should be using dedicated safe parsers. 
It looks like the variable `FRAME` holds a `type` object (i.e. a class) and not the container object that you were expecting to be in it. Can you show the line where you create `FRAME`? You may just need to add an extra set of parentheses.
&gt; Frankly you shouldn't be using % for that either. Of course you should. It's perfectly suitable and well-understood. &gt; You should be using dedicated safe parsers which you then pass to .format. Why would you even use format if you're already implementing your own format-parsing routine?
Which is why I said a more realistic example. It's very handy to have a name of the thing you are putting there so I don't accident write "{} : {}".format(self.value, self.key) And cause a bunch of problems. 
Sure, but for something that short the chances are that you wouldn't make that mistake. For something a bit longer (e.g. with 5-7 variables) I might start naming the variables.
Well because tuples and dictionaries are handled differently when used with `%` which can cause unexpected errors and because `.format` has extended formatting options.
Depends on what you are scaping. If you want to scrape tables that are generated using javascript you will need Selenium, Beautiful Soup, and Pandas. Once you arrive at your url you want to scrape a javascript table, run this... For me... the most powerful 4 lines of code I have ever used for scraping tables. #Now get the innerHTML page with javascript tables and hand off to Beautiful Soup html = self.driver.execute_script("return document.getElementsByTagName('html')[0].innerHTML") soup2 = BeautifulSoup(html,'lxml') table2 = soup2.find_all('table')[0] #df2 is my pandas dataframe with all vehicle history table information df2 = pd.read_html(str(table2))[0]
I just wrote: FRAME = bytearray btw it should have been FRAME[(x*80+ y)] = a[y] 
Just like I thought. `FRAME = bytearray` doesn’t create a byte array; it just makes “FRAME” another reference to the same class that “bytearray” refers to. To create an array with an initial length of 120*80, you’d need to do `FRAME = bytearray(120 * 80)`.
Wouldn't that result in 'bool' object has no attribute 'all' ?
Why import an extra module when you can use the builtin sum. sum([hello ', name, ', you are ', age, ' years old.'], "")
One very important thing I recently discovered about f-strings is that you can use a capital F.
Once you know, it seems logical :) thanks man!
 def func(string): buf = "" nums = [] for c in string: nbuf = buf + c try: float(nbuf) buf = nbuf except ValueError: try: nums.append(float(buf)) except ValueError: pass finally: if c == "." or c.isdigit(): buf = c else: buf = "" try: nums.append(float(buf)) except ValueError: pass return nums
&gt; Well because tuples and dictionaries are handled differently when used with % which can cause unexpected errors That is a minor concern, and one which can be trivially remedied with a trivial proxy object (also it's tuples and mappings not tuples and dictionaries). &gt; because .format has extended formatting options. printf-style has extended formatting options, and if format has additional ones compared to printf-style, I know of none which is of any use in translations contexts.
Bunch looks interesting! It does provide access with simpler syntax. Though it also requires another import and a function to convert other data types before use. That's what I was getting away from when I stopped using yaml and then json. Functionally, there must be a few dozen ways that all work just fine. So this isn't a technical challenge. I should clarify somewhere here that my question is about finding the aesthetically *lightest* way to do this. Ideally no library imports, no conversion needed, and simple syntax in both the definition of the values and their usage. But I'll check out Bunch and see how it feels. Thanks
If % was good enough for sed, awk and cc back in the 1970s, it's (still) good enough for me.
This one happens to be on digital ocean, but just about any will do 
thanks 
okay man ..thanks .. will check out 
thanks 
I'm taking edX computer science course using Python, and using other different \(random\) sites to exercise.
cool, but why is that important?
You go try that in an interpreter ;) 
In answer to your first question, nope.`colvec` is a numpy array with element-wise operators. 
`format` is a lot more powerful than printf style https://pyformat.info/
I have % pretty much burned in my brain after 19 years, but I'm starting to use .format quite a bit more. 
&gt;There are three Four. `string.Template` ____ Or more if you count `str.__add__` and `str.join`
Sanic! I guess you gotta go fast!
Thank you very much for posting this. My company is figuring out how to deploy an ES integration. Dealing with ES via Python will make our work much easier.
You can basically do anything with python.. however it is quite popular for machine learning and deep learning now a days. but you can develop web applications with django and flask, you can develop realtime application with asyncio.. you can develop GUI application with tkinter and many libraries out there.. you can build cli scripts.. you can automate stuffs with building scripts and many more. and best IDE for python for beginners is PyCharm by JetBrains.. check it out or else you can configure python to any text editor like atom, sublime or vscode with plugins and work with it. I personally use Atom, its free and awesome.
The best thing I've found is [recordtype](https://pypi.org/project/recordtype/), it's a mutable NamedTuple.
.format, because it'll handle Python's dynamic typing; I've run into issues assuming typing with the % operator. Can't wait for Python 3.7's fstrings, those look really useful.
I prefer either .format or fstrings. I'm from a background of C development though and I'm comfortable with the % style as well but the others are more readable in my opinion. 
Dawg, `f”i have {apple_count} apples”`
I’ll leave the specific advice to the already excellent posts in this topic and I just wanted thank you for wanting to share your knowledge with the rest of the python community. Good luck :)
Because F is bigger than f.
By using f-string, you can guarantee your program will only run on 3.6+. :) If you can, they are faster as well as better than any other option.
My pleasure. I did complex work in minutes thanks to some amazing packages built by others. 
I'll check it out
Looks very interesting
Love the explanations and visual resources
It will come in handy
Yes, turn these into date objects instead of doing messy string typing. datetime.strptime("12-19", "%m-%y") Or something roughly like that. Then you can use all the power of datetimes ordering, etc. You could sort like sorted(mydates, key=lambda x: x.month()) Don't name your variables array or arr, use something descriptive. 
You don't have to wait, they're in 3.6 or if you're using pypy they backported them to 3.5
If you are looking for a job, I recommend learning Django to make a website. Lots of job postings are looking for software developers for web technologies. Django isn't the most popular web framework, but it is respectable and will prepare yourself into the web development world. 
That only works if your interpolation is local. If you need to pass the format string elsewhere it won't. Given passing formatting strings around is potentially dangerous. That said, can't wait for 3.6 to be the lowest supported version so I can just fstring most things. 
Definitely follow /u/Mr_Again's advice. But the reason your code doesn't work as expected is the result of the split is a string, and they aren't being sorted in numerical order. arr = sorted(arr, key=lambda x:int(x.split("-")[0]))
Jaja I'm a teenager , but I will consider it 
f strings best strings!
In order, f-strings (I use Scala most of the time lately, so f-strings feel right at home with how strings are formatted there), format and... that's it. I no longer use % unless it's throwaway code I run in the console, just for typing a few less characters. Keep in mind format can... format the same way % can (see [this](https://pyformat.info) for a refresher)
Life could be easy if python only use one type of quote for string. we might have `print('$easy life.')
oh nice, Python now has a feature that Ruby has only had since it came out.
Obligatory r/learnpython My answer will not modify your code, but instead just point you in the right, imho, direction. Use a context manager (with open(filename) as f) to perform your file operations. Those include f.write, f.read, and so forth. I could also recommend list comprehensions, function pointers, etc, but you’re doing fine so far. 
 of course .format() can do number formatting - "a number {:.2f}"! also you don't have to use explicit {0} indexing, you can go by position {} or use labels {a}. https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/string.html#format-examples You just discovered .format()? people are mostly migrating away from that to fstrings if they are using modern versions. dude, you have to read the docs 
Format absolutely all the way. Oftentimes you just name the variables and use a dictionary with values.
I use %, I find .format to be too verbose
You can contribute to open source. Mozilla has an amazing community and has a lot of bugs/quality of life fixes, that need to be done in python. I would suggest going to Bugs Ahoy! https://www.joshmatthews.net/bugsahoy/ and select Python on the bottom left checkboxes. It will show you a list of bugs and you can see their details. It may seem daunting at first, but the simple bugs require less coding and help understand the workflow. It mostly deals with automation and testing.
Yes string interpolation is a nice feature, and it's cool that Ruby has it too, other languages like PHP and Javascript have variations of it as well :) 
That’s my one use main use case for `.format` now. Some of our code defines templates that we use throughout a module and there’s no such thing as a deferred f-string. 
&gt; format is a lot more powerful than printf style Again, not for the purpose of translations and localisations, and what additional power it has is a *problem* in that context not an advantage. &gt; the datetime module has locale aware __format__ for example. It's an embedded strftime which makes it worthless: the locale is global and the only somewhat correct format operators in a localization context are `%c` and `%x` which are both inconvenient and insufficient (can't select desirable fields and single width) unless you want to force every translator to reimplement their locale's datetime formatting as part of the translation.
Another point: Posting the image of the code is frowned upon, and it would be better for people to access it if you put it on a service like gist.github.com or repl.it
Just curious, when you want a blank line like OP did in his string, is it better to make an empty string or to use \n on the next sentence?
My guess is they’re new to this, so they don’t know how to use VC/repl.it. They make lots of new developer decisions with their code: * Multiple ifs when a simple list comp or eval() - I know, it’s dangerous - would suffice * Using no functions * Importing random in a while loop * Using print() with commas instead of fstrings, .format, format specifiers, or even ‘+’ concatenation. * Breaking a shitton more PEP8 guidelines * More things that I don’t want to type
I use format and prefer it. I also love that f-strings are a thing in Python 3.6. It makes strong interpolation way easier. String format is also a mini language, which adds a lot of power to it. You can do decimal formatting, padding, etc. all with formatting. See https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/stdtypes.html#str.format It’s the way forward, prefer that over % 
\n
Hey there! You might be interested in a library I wrote called yapconf See more here: https://github.com/loganasherjones/yapconf It allows you to load configurations from JSON or YAML or in memory dictionaries. The config you load is available via properties or via the key value pair. Let me know what you think!
Thanks
wtf is month 13? you are almost there with your hack, but it's still sorting as strings - not numbers. polar has your fix in his comment. Mr_Again has the best answer. turn them into dates and don't do this messy hacking. that would also have caught your data error. 
They are faster?
I prefer vinyl too
Indeed they are. https://cito.github.io/blog/f-strings/
Or just `' '.join(map(str, ['hello', name, 'you are', age, 'years old.']))`

That was a good read. I would have expected f strings to be faster than `%` but not `.format()`
Use Regex import re def find_floats(string): return [float(match) for match in re.finditer(pattern=r'\d+\.?\d*|\D\.\d+', string=string)]
Is the deferred use with i18n for multiple languages? Not run across a use case for this and curious where that would come into play.
Looks good. You might be interested to look at and maybe include my wikitranslator: https://github.com/susca/wikitranslator Feel free to clone or copy/paste.
str(var) + &gt; .format &gt; %var &gt;I've faced that error so many times in the earlier days when I simply used to "There are " + x + " mangoes.". This works great in most other languages as they "auto-convert" the x from integer to string, but not python because of its "explicitness". I don't know what you mean? Works fine: "today is " + str(datetime.now()) + "!" or more elegantly date = datetime.now() string = "today is "+ str ( date ) + "!" If the type itself is not convertable with str(), some of it's attributes should be.
There's a typo in the README, under the first point \("Downloading pywikipedia"\): `pip install pywikipeida` Otherwise nice and simple wrapper around a few URLs! :)
&gt;s = 'blah blah blah blah blah {0} blah blah blah'.format(math.pi) f strings can be multi-line, so it could be: s = '''blah blah blah blah blah {math.pi}\ blah blah blah\ blah blah more blah''' 
Month 13 is Smarch.
One thing that I haven't seen anyone mention that makes str.format advantageous over %--you can repeat arguments. I also think the syntax is quite clear when this is done, since you have to do it using kwargs: print('This is a float: {fnum:.2f}. This is an int: {inum}, which is ' 'different than a float like {fnum:.2f}'.format(fnum=4.568, inum=11)) Gives: This is a float: 4.57. This is an int: 11, which is different than a float like 4.57 
Yah I agree, this is my only, yet main, contention with f-strings; the layout when long variables come into play. It just looks ugly af.
F strings
Oh yes, thanks 🙏:)
&gt;I don't know what you mean? I think they mean that they try it without the explicit conversion via str() and expect it to work automatically. Also, I disagree that str() is best--it allows no control over how the variable is formatted into the string, using the default automatically. It's equivalent to %s or {} with no format specification, but with the other two, you can also choose to specify a format if you want.
Oh yes that looks interesting, may see when I start adding more language support 
&gt;It's equivalent to %s or {} with no format specification, but with the other two, you can also choose to specify a format if you want. [Are you referring to this special but functionally redundant syntax?](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/string.html#formatstrings) 
Don't sell yourself short. Skills are skills.
f-strings are only evaluated in their current context. Mostly because they'd be incredibly dangerous otherwise. i18n stuff, like babel, are lazily evaluated but use the % formatting style with format like arguments. kind of confusing honestly.
Yes? What do you mean by functionally redundant?
&gt; neither work for translatable data This is the best and possibly most rational argument against f strings and format(), I think.
Hahahaha. Dude this is dope and very creative, hats off
Thanks for checking.. Its actually going pretty well. Because of the nature and complexity of the project, I am dealing more with the underlying Operating systems, network protocols, logging, testing etc, compared to `Python`libraries.. `Vagrant`is good, for reliable settings.. but my experience has been the more complex a system gets.. the more likelyhood there will be a bug, that I will have to chase down. `Vagrant` relies on `VirtualBox` as the provider.. so I am adding another layer of complexity. Also I have to learn how to convert the current scripts to `Vagrantfile` format. If I started out with `Vagrant` probably it would have been worth it.. but now that I already know and have the scripts to setup my `VM`, it will take me more time to convert to `Vagrant`. So I have delayed it for now..Perhaps when somebody else joins the project or I have more time.. I will convert the scripts to `Vagrant` files Its not that difficult.. and its interesting learning curve for sure, which I can utilize in future projects for sure..
Pretty cool.. when are you thinking of releasing the bot? And what infrastructure are you planning on adding?
Illusion 100
I'm not a fan of having the same functionality implemented multiple times. To me it looks like you can do the same things .format offers in regular python.
Nice work. What kind of algorithm did you use to translate the audio?
I've been working on a very complex (for me) sort of battle simulator utilizing Python's regular file creator, as I haven't yet created my own IDE. I'd always wanted to make it as soon as I'd started learning Python, and while it's all still text-based, I'm incredibly impressed at the amount of learned about Python during the process of building it. Basically, a player selects their class (as in the WoW definition, not the Python keyword.Ironically, I hadn't learned about those at that point, and right now I'd rather not go back and change everything even though I now know how.) After they choose their class, they begin to battle an enemy! If they win, they receive experience points based on the enemy's level (and later, their stature - wretch, common, rare, boss or mythic). Their moves auto-rank up and increase their stat points, even changing certain modifiers altogether, or adding previously locked modifiers. (An example would be changing adding a shield that blocks magical or physical damage, or changing a shield from one to blocking both.) I've now learned a fair bit about OOP and classes (thanks, u/coreyschafer) and added an equipment system based on that. Just this morning, I've finally completed the loot generating system for when an enemy dies. I was giving it a good ol' college try last night, but by 1:30 in the morning I was approximately useless. Either way, I'm *nearly* finished! There's just a few more things to add, culminating with a save/load system utilizing JSON (as right now you only maintain your character and inventory up until you die or the game restarts.) and then it's finally complete. I know it's basic, but I'm proud nonetheless. 
That’s the kind of use I had in mind. Our S3 buckets are named in a certain pattern, so it’s easiest to have a module-level template instead of repeating it dozens of places. That’s easy enough with `str.format` templates, but there’s no f-string variant like: ``` template = deferred’{foo}/{bar}’ ... foo = 123 bar = 456 template() ```
Fair enough, but I don't think str() and str.format are redundant, since you can't control formatting with str(). I agree that % and str.format are largely redundant, though there are a couple things I've found you can do with str.format but not %--e.g. justifying to one side of a string: &gt;&gt;&gt; '{:&lt;12.2f}'.format(5.33333) '5.33 ' &gt;&gt;&gt; '{:&gt;12.2f}'.format(5.33333) ' 5.33' &gt;&gt;&gt; '{:^12.2f}'.format(5.33333) ' 5.33 ' I would also argue that str.format _is_ "regular python", but that's more semantics.
It's basically the only place where I don't use f-strings or .format, especially since Python 3 has format_map (that's the one bit of ugliness when trying to use str.format in 2.7).
When I was learning python, I wrote a web scraper, just to collect news articles from the top ten news sites in Germany. After that I build a tool to collect weather data from different regions/cities in Germany to find the city with the best weather. Currently I am building a tool at work to collect data from different APIs to then compare (graph and report) different data points for different domains as well as competitor's domains. Other stuff was more one off stuff and smaller scripts. 
If you want some help vectorizing functions, I can throw some time your way if it's an open source project.
Cool stuff but why is this a 3 minute video? You couldn’t just show us the audio solver working one time? 
I'll forgive a dude for splurging a little time showing off
&gt; I don't think str() and str.format are redundant, since you can't control formatting with str(). of course you can. n = round(5.3,2) total=12 s=str(n)+(total-len(n)) * " "
I use .format(), but when I started, all the tuts and books I read used %var and it made no sense to me as a beginner. Now i have to figure out f'strings' because they say it's way faster
Use percentage for logging, since the string expression is only evaluated if the logging level is required. Otherwise square brackets and f strings are the winners here.
C-string style (`%s %d`) is great for the `logging` module so you can use `LoggingAdapter` wrappers. `.format` style is great when you have to print an entire collection of data. `s = 'status {status} running for {uptime}s on server {host}'.format(**info)` F-strings are great for selective local formatting.
`%` is actually faster than `.format()`, but messier.
TIL again 
Nice work dude! Is it open source?
Typically, I'll focus on building modules/classes/packages and then glue them together to build my program. Build a piece of code that gets your data from Website A, then one that does it for Website B, then something that pulls those together, then something that reads your configuration from a file, etc. A benefit of this is that your code ends up more structured and isolated, communicating with each other across well\-defined boundaries. This makes it easier to reason about and easier to write tests for. Then build your GUI and plug all the code you've already wrote into it.
It doesn't appear as though anything about this is automated. I could be wrong, but it look like human driven mouse clicks.

Awesome code!! I will never be that competent. Quick general question: The function naming, is it PEP8 compliant? I'm a newbie and I read that function should be named audio_solver() vs AudioSolver() Did I understand PEP8 right?

`str.format` except on the rare occasions where I'm using a _really_ old version of Python. I like f-strings better but I rarely have the opportunity to use Python 3.6.
Okay that makes a lot of sense actually. Thanks!
Naming convention is just a suggestion, you don't have to follow it to the tee. You'll find that a lot of devs actually don't follow PEP8 conventions. Don't stress about it.
so it's a class instance
I'd imagine it won't be hard to implement an automated click version. IIRC pyautogui does that, and probably quite a few libraries out there as well.
Ok, I'll ask there
&gt; I will never be that competent. Never say this. It might look impossible to you now, but in the (maybe not even so distant) future you say "Hmm, looks interesting, I'll give it a go as well". Stuff like this is often using the right backend tools with just some Python to combine everything. &gt; Did I understand PEP8 right? Correct. It might be a class, which is named right, but used incorrectly then. Also remember that PEP8 is a general guideline, nobody is required to follow it.
Not everything has to be pep8 compliant. However capitalized names are usually for class definitions functions and methods are lowercase and snake cased.
Great find in the stdlib!
&gt; Now i have to figure out f'strings' because they say it's way faster Chances are VERY high that the speed difference won't be noticeable for most real world uses..
Reminds me a javascript template tags, which are admittedly pretty neat. I don't think you can defer them though - maybe with hackery you could. That's about the string related thing that javacript has over python. 
I'm aware of this but I plan on making websites with django and if the case comes up where I have to format strings, I'd like the project to scale well. Although I pretty new to django and I don't know if I'll be using too much string formatting as opposed to jinja templates and html
Nice intro, thank you!
True, I’ll use % in backwards compatible code for 1-2 arguments only. Note that % can also take a dictionary and named specifiers by dict key. For complex blocks though I prefer format, or f-strings on newer code.
very cool. Would love to hear about how you went about solving this problem!
As far as I understand this. You download the mp3 file split it into little parts where each of the numbers figure and send those audio files to Bing for speech recognition. Am I right ?
Hows it work??!
The don't stress it part really is about things like calling a class `Rss` vs `RSS` or other details like that. Nobody is suggesting people start naming the functions CamelCased.
Am interested, thank you.
Yeah pyautogui or just load up the AutoItX3 dll file and knock up whatever functions you need (mouse move, mouse click, send keys etc). The whole thing could be automated so easily.
Code?
Most welcome :-) Let me know how it goes. You may DM me if need help.
Most welcome :-)
If you just need to perform linear regression, you can do that in say any standard spreadsheet program. E.g., [libreoffice calc](https://help.libreoffice.org/Calc/Regression_Analysis), [gnumeric](http://www.hep.by/gnu/gnumeric/regression-tool.shtml). If you want to perform a linear regression in python, there are a lot of options. For example: * https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.14.0/reference/generated/scipy.stats.linregress.html * http://www.statsmodels.org/dev/regression.html * http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression.html * https://www.tensorflow.org/api_guides/python/regression_examples
Having had the same problem as you and having gone the tkinter way I would recommend that you consider a web based frontend. Easier to maintain, flexible and works everywhere
Seems like a bad idea for scaling. Actually automating the inputs from the OS would limit you to one browser. Better off mimicking mouse movements through CDP(Chrome DevTools Protocol). 
From the file list, looks like they just followed GitHub's checklist of recommendations: [https://github.com/ahopkins/sanic\-jwt/community](https://github.com/ahopkins/sanic-jwt/community) Personally, for small projects, I think adding a code of conduct may do more harm than good, especially since they are usually longer than the project license. In this project, for example, just adding a short paragraph with an external link for the full statement should be enough.
TIL `format_map`
So I'll be the first to reply that this is NOT a "Super Beginner" Python question as this is fairly advanced stuff, I would say you are an advanced beginner. Post this to stack overflow as this is possibly in their range of skill and I'm not going to go over the grammatical issues or the over documented declarations or imports that are really not needed in python but this might be for memory reasons as you state you are a beginner. That being said... Gwedo believes tests are important and I've noticed you have no testing in this routine. I highly highly recommend you start with smaller pieces and weave them together with tests. Then bigger issues tend to solve them self easier as it's a matter of form or function within the structure that tests will reveal within your code. Looks good but I vote this is a SO post. Link to it and I'll review it there.
Why? It seems legit to me. 
Sure, there are bound to better ways, AutoIt was my goto for Windows automation back in the day so I know it well.
Recaptcha is meant to stop bots... this is a program doing the recaptcha for the programmer 
Agreed! That is relatively new \(depending on which function you are using\), and so many tutorials pre\-date that change and/or the tutorial author hasn't kept up with changes to pandas and/or they just prefer using the numbers :\) I do prefer 'index' and 'columns', and that's what I now teach \(such as in my [PyCon 2018 pandas tutorial](https://github.com/justmarkham/pycon-2018-tutorial)\).
 That's beside the point, that can be automated easily. The hard part is the captcha, which was specifically designed to prevent automation.
you don't worry that this is going to push them to make the captcha harder for people with visual disabilities?
I'm sorry, I don't quite understand the question... could you clarify what you mean by "maintain the data if a feature class"? Thanks!
What is it based on, an RNN I assume?
Might lose the speed advantage if you have dictionary unpacking. I always use the version that is easier to read or understand, until I prove performance is an issue. It usually isn't. Especially string formatting. You are usually not formatting text in a tight loop.
Good point. Most loops I encounter see 1-10 items anyways, not thousands. If I ever get to the day where string formatting is significantly affecting my application performance... that will be an interesting day indeed.
Oh, I've never used it. I spent my fair amount of research on trying to break this damn captcha with the intention of having it multithreaded. Started with Selenium, then webfriend, and lastly with an unofficial port of Puppeteer(Pyppeteer). 
Hello! I'm a bot! It looks to me like your post might be better suited for r/learnpython, a sub geared towards questions and learning more about python. That said, I am a bot and it is hard to tell. While I was at it, I checked [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) and found these results which might be useful: 1. [Methods in R for large complex survey data sets?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35210712/methods-in-r-for-large-complex-survey-data-sets) Though fair warning, this section of the my code is under development, and I don't expect these links to be very useful ###I am currently running in a supervised mode for testing and only comment when it's been approved *** ^(this bot is written by /u/IAmKindOfCreative)
Looks good!!! Can you set it up so I can choose whose twitter account t we look for input? I'm currently building an AWS backend with a multi property social media analytical engine. Would be willing to collaborate.
Thanks for the reply, I have posted on SO here is the link: [https://stackoverflow.com/q/50670263/9889210](https://stackoverflow.com/q/50670263/9889210) I'm not too sure about testing just yet as I am still trying to grasp certain aspects.
If you are using pandas, you can use the `.value_counts()`. [Doc here](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.Series.value_counts.html). This is optimized for string counts and saves you the trouble of re-inventing it. 
The main part is he is able to get the CAPTCHA solution automatically, gluing everything together is some work, but is pretty straightforward. 
That would be super cool. It actually is set up to take in any users twitter handler as seen in the picture below. Also you'll need your own twitter API tokens to run the first part of the program (theDonNLTK.py, although that only handles the retrieval and save of the data) You can run the second program using the provided data in the git, it just parses the data for Proper nounds by default (and you can change the part of speech identifier in the program
I’m stuck on python 3.4 for a bit at work, so fstrings don’t work for me currently. I usually use both the “%” and .format but the contexts depends. If I’m debugging and I want to print out something to the console to see where I am in the program execution, I just use “%”. If I’m making a template that’s going to be used in an email, for example, I’ll use .format since it makes the template make more sense. 
Great job!
That would not be good PR! Just imagine the headlines "Hax0rs defeat captcha making browsing harder for the visually impaired!"
You can do the same with % if you supply a dict rather than a list/tuple.
We built a twitter bot that read the local traffic as if it was spoken by Thor about how the Avengers were solving the traffic. Cops became Ironman, tow trucks were hulk etc.
No worries I'm neck need testing for the second time and it's like this "I think" Answer me a question first. In two sentences or less, define the quantitative outputs you want from your code.
Unless I'm misunderstanding your question, you probably just need something like: import pandas as pd import matplotlib.pyplot as plt boroughs_df = pd.read_csv('path_to_csv.csv') # this is a Pandas DataFrame boroughs_df['Boroughs'].value_counts().plot() # Or make the plot fancy looking 
Yes, thats the naming for a class, not a function. Normally you'll see `module_name.ClassName()` but yeah in this case AudioSolver is probably a function (though it could be a class that automatically starts in `__init__`, which would be a bad thing.
I'd like to see what library or api he used for parsing the audio. Would be extra ironic if it was google speech api.
You don't even have to break at the period like the others' examples: s = ('blah blah blah blah blah ' '{0} blah blah blah;.format(math.pi)) Will work too, it will join the two strings in the parenthesis.
What does your CSV look like? Can you post at least the header, or type `print(csv.head())` somewhere in the code?
how did this get almost 200 upvotes? This is like 1/3 of the views of the video itself. I watched through most of this video and found it rather underwhelming. Here's a better video on this topic (in my opinion): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elojMnjn4kk&amp;list=PL5-da3qGB5ICeMbQuqbbCOQWcS6OYBr5A
Is there a legitimate purpose to this? To me this seems like another example of "just because we can does not mean we should". I suffer from both vision and hearing issues and these Captchas are getting so complex I sometimes cannot get past them. So I really hope that this effort is for good and not evil.
As if you didn’t have enough recommendation already, I’m a fan of `attr`: import attr class Network: discovery_multicast_group = attr.ib(default="224.3.29.71") discovery_multicast_port = attr.ib(default=10010, type=int) discovery_response_port = attr.ib(default=10011, type=int) pubsub_pub_port_a = attr.ib(default=10012, type=int) pubsub_pub_port_b = attr.ib(default=10014, type=int) If you are gonna use json files then presumably you’d have a `dict` with the keyword/value pairs, then you could do this import json with open(‘network_config.json’, ‘r’) as f: net_cfg = json.load(f) my_network = Network(**net_cfg) 
You do know that a bot is a program, right?
Security fractures - he solved the ReCapcha He built the smartest bot in his toolshed! He proved it could be done With no fingers and no thumb It found all the signs on the road ahead
Thanks for the suggestion. But this seems much heavier syntactically than what I'm already doing. My question is really a style question about how simple and light I can make the syntax of settings that can be modified by users.
if the whole browsing process was automated selenium webdriver does this pretty intuitively
It started running last night and is running today as well (though it is in a supervised mode). Hopefully you'll never see him since it's primary goal is to direct basic question submissions to the r/learnpython sub. The bot is /u/pythonHelperBot The infrastructure was adding files save the submission ID and username after each of the bots comments so the bot never comments on a post made by a user when it's commented on some previous post made by the same user, and never comments on a post more than once even if the bot is restarted: basically infrastructure ensuring the bot runs ethically and avoids accidental spam. I also added some blocks so the bot ran in a loop after it loaded its classifiers into memory, following the style of my twitter bots. Once it runs long enough, is programming-killing error free and doesn't have too many false positives I'm going to try and run it on a raspberry pi. 
That... was my point yes
I mean then I don’t understand what you’re asking for? Your example is already concise and succinct. What’s wrong with what you already have?
It's pretty good but classes seem a bit conceptually heavy for just a mapping data type. I was wondering if there was a native data structure that could be as syntactically light. Maybe a trick for dicts or something more intuitive for this application. Just so I can communicate better, what you think I was asking? 
That guy that commented on SO is 100% right. You can do whatever it is you want with like 10 lines of code. All we need is to see the structure of the csv file. 
This post is better suited for r/learnpython 
Trying to create a virtual environment from a command prompt lol.
Great thank you!
Good job on the script! A couple of comments: * On several separate occasions, you maintain a `count` variable that you manually increment. You can make your life easier by replacing count = 0 for tournament in future_tournaments: ... with for count, tournament in enumerate(future_tournaments): ... saving you the hassle of manual incrementation. Read more about `enumerate()` [here](https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#enumerate). * I noticed that the `finished()`, `created()` and `started()` functions are very similar. Would it be possible to accomplish the same task with a more general function that you could apply in all three cases, with different arguments? * For future projects, you can use (argparse)[https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html#module-argparse] to parse command line arguments, moving the help section at the beginning of your script to the command line. Other than that, nice work! Hope to see more of your stuff soon!
That's my guess.
What? I don't even know how to do that I am a labview developer if you can call someone like that a Dev. I work for rf department in Poland in one of the universities I don't know how to write stupid bots.
I thought you wanted what was essentially a `dict` but with dot access. If you’re worried about memory usage you could just define `__slots__` in your original classes. Or, I dunno, you could subclass dict to implement dotted attribute access? class Parameter(dict): def __getattr__(self, k): return self[k] def __setattr__(self, k, v): self[k] = v my_network = Parameter(port=42) my_network[‘port’] # 42 ny_network.port # 42
&gt; Bing that is what he does, you can see the host speech.platform.bing.com Awesome project, could be 100% automatized very easily with selenium or similar. OP are you planning on sharing the code? if not it doesnt really make sense to post your cool project.
:)
Ya, just wanted to show its not a one time fluke.
reCapthca detects mouse movements on screen. I use pyautogui's 'tween' feature to move the mouse in ways that are more human, rather than just using a straight line.
You are correct, I got lazy with that one.
Had no sexist motive behind it. I just found it funny how the video uses a missleading thumbnail (in a way) to appeal to largely male audiance (sorry if the observation is sexist and insults you). And how is my statment delusional? P.s. I also had some experience with labview in my university days. I enjoyed automating experiments with it, good luck in your field.
I will share the code. Right now i am using some sloppy os.system() commands and what not that I want to straighten out before I embarrass myself. I've just been a tad busy lately, but I will.
great! Im saying that because I would definitely help making this a package (even a scrapy addon)
In my experience, very poorly.
I will for sure release the code in a few days. As I said below, right now there is some sloppy os.system() commands and what not that I want to straighten out. As of now the program is very un-scalable. This may seem sort of irrational, but I really don't want this to end up having a negative effect. It's a cool side project, but there are reasons that Google spends a lot of time and money making reCaptcha reliable. 
Well, it exposes a flaw in reCaptcha, which could eventually be fixed by google. Proving that this works by example proves that actual spam bots can defeat the system and post spam.
Pretty much what I did (off someone else's library) couple of years back. And that's also what he's doing. The audio can be easily deciphered, given enough training (data points) to the parser, doesn't even have to be bing.
Maybe, you could try: https://github.com/altair-viz/ https://m.youtube.com/watch?t=6178s&amp;v=ms29ZPUKxbU
You know what? Code that works is code that works. Everyone expects code to be a bit of a work in progress, but it looks like you have it doing what it is supposed to, I would put it on github and work on it over time. Plus, you never know, you may get some good contributions. I personally would love to contribute to something like this with interfacing and automation of some of the tasks, maybe even help to get it to scale out multiple parallel instances and practical implementation examples. Definitely keep it on the DL though, a proof of concept like this definitely is a security workaround and google will find a way to patch for it if it picks up a lot of steam. When you're ready could you send me a link to the github (or gitlab or whatever you use) so I can use it and possibly contribute?
What does that `@threaded` decorator do above that async function?
I will judge, looks good and where are your tests? :-)
He was joking. No one really concats strings with + because it's slow as fuck. The recommended way is list.join or f-strings.
Noone cares because we're all using f-strings now 😀😀
Tupac cares, if don't nobody else care.
OTOH recaptcha used to be more of an academic/ public domain benefit thing and is now used to benefit Google’s mostly free but for profit services. 
Check out Raymond Hettinger's "Beyond PEP8" video on YouTube for more perspective on code style vs readability vs stability vs compliance. One of the more memorable talks I've ever watched (I've probably watched a couple hundred of these sorts of videos and this is definitely in my top 5).
&gt; Google spends a lot of time and money making reCaptcha reliable This makes it so cool that you broke it
Ah, right, I always forgot that. Switched to using str.format for everything before I learned that that was a thing. Edited my comment.
Casting the net a little wide there. Tonnes of sites use recaptcha to (try to) make sure their sites aren't abused by bots. I personally don't think it's all that effective, I'm sure someone is using mechanical Turk to solve them already.
Ah, well yes, that will have the same effect. I would argue that using str.format yields much clearer code (took me a few seconds to figure out what you were doing). Also saves a few lines since you don't have to define new variables purely for formatting. So maybe they are ultimately redundant, but I would argue that str.format will almost certainly be clearer and more concise when doing format specification.
He’s saying that the bot itself is an illusion. As it is tricking the captcha
“Lots of devs” includes Guido van Rossum, eg. `list` (should be `List`) and `True` (should be `true`). 
no, no. neither for any test nor taking any course, just for quick reference...
So this is the code equivalent of "fridge art"?
&gt; twitter bot that read the local traffic as if it was spoken by Thor about how the Avengers That would be awesome to see! Do you have a video or anything?
Would be awesome if the OP posted a GitHub 
Ummmmmmmm, trying to remember the name. I'm not remembering it but, we currently use "Thor does traffic" and working on "superhero food truck" or "avengers traffic" so it was like that. Two plus years ago. Ahhhhh haaaa! Dopeywins, wasn't my first choice but we won the hackathon and it was a great learning experience. Check out the twitter page.
Wraps it with it's own event loop and runs the func with the default thread pool executor. For example... @wraps(func) async def wrap(*args, **kwargs): loop = asyncio.get_event_loop() return await loop.run_in_executor... return wrap
That's hilariously true.
Good thing no one at Google is ever on Reddit or would ever visit a programming language sub!
Not yet. But will release soon. Including a deployed demo.
But reCaptcha gives words as well. How is he getting numbers only?
Pretty sure you can just completely do the clicking part via selenium. I don't think Recaptcha screws you over fake / hard to verify clicks, just makes you do more work.

I did that same thing with an mmo bot. Cool script.
Sorry bot, I ninja edited. I guess you were the better ninja
Maybe send code to google so they can improve captcha. Of course seeing tge code myself would be nice. 
Great project. I landed on list comprehension, scan quickly....great content. Just bookmarked..thanks
Sauce???
Oh that's pretty nice way of doing it actually. `run_in_executor`, isn't really a thread though, is it?
No need to hire minimum wage workers to solve captcha by yourself when many sites provides access to those captcha-solving minimum wage workers as an api like this one: http://www.deathbycaptcha.com/
I get that f string has speed advantage but I’ll take string formatting any day for readability 
I really prefer .format versus f-strings. It's just clearer for me to separate the formatted from the data to be placed in the string.
Selenium has a python library, that's the gold standard for web automation and testing, plus you can run it headless, never even have to see the browser window.
We have this in game dev. Characters can speak certain templated messages ("Hello $name!") and these have to be editable by non-programmers (i.e. content builders) so they're managed by a GUI editor. The name it's addressed to won't be known at that point, since we don't know what the player will pick, or who the player will interact with.
vim because is simple, yet, powerful.
I love atom, the customizations, the'hacker' community, the plugins. It's also the first one I really started developing in.
&gt; run_in_executor, isn't really a thread though, is it? It is when you set the first argument for it as None and set ThreadPoolExecutor as the default executor! :) 
automating the browser portion (navigate to recaptcha page, click audio button, wait for download, send numbers to text box, and clicking submit) is fairly trivial and can be done with a number of well-known tools (selenium, pyautogui, etc.). Solving recaptcha, on the other hand, is not at all a trivial task when writing browser automation scripts. Hence the value of OPs post.

Maybe sort the words in random order and then use them one by one?
Sublime Text
Any link to what this command is called?
PyCharm Sublime Text This question gets asked at least weekly. A search of this subreddit will yield plenty of discussion.
They gave you the name of the command: `random.shuffle` BTW it sounds like you're experiencing the same phenomenon as https://labs.spotify.com/2014/02/28/how-to-shuffle-songs/
Look into [`itertools`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html).
The common projects all have a very similar workflows, so any of numpy, scipy, pandas, scikit, opencv, astropy, ... all have open issues you could take a look at and take a stab at fixing.
&gt; That's hilariously `True`. ftfy
You shouldn't try to build all possibilities of words. This is time consuming and memory intensive. Look into the known algorithms for spell checkers. Heres an example: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance#Computing_Levenshtein_distance

I won't claim this is the best and/or fastest algorithm but this seems like it might do what you are asking? &gt;&gt;&gt; from itertools import product ... ... ... def solution(kvs, s): ... char_combos = [[char] + kvs.get(char, []) for char in s] ... return [''.join(p) for p in product(*char_combos)] ... &gt;&gt;&gt; d = { ... 'u': ['e', 'o'], ... 'm': ['n'], ... 'o': ['u'] ... } &gt;&gt;&gt; s = 'jumbo' &gt;&gt;&gt; solution(d, s) ['jumbo', 'jumbu', 'junbo', 'junbu', 'jembo', 'jembu', 'jenbo', 'jenbu', 'jombo', 'jombu', 'jonbo', 'jonbu'] Generating all of these permutations seems extremely inefficient though (especially for potentially thousands of words?). Have you thought about using something like [levenshtein distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance) instead? 
selenium can be easily detected by googles captcha so it wouldn't be a feasible option for this
How? You can change he user agent strings to whatever you want, there's nothing about it that should identify it to google or any other search engine. 
I’m working in a simple script that: - downloads a video (or a list of videos) - extract the audio - upload just the audio to my personal Dropbox acc - create an rss that will take the meta data and the direct link for these audio files on Dropbox And then use this xml as a RSS feed for my podcast app. My intention is to download lectures and similar videos where I would want to listen while commuting without worrying about loading the video. I usually do this manually, for each video with YouTube dl, ffmpeg and then uploading manually to Dropbox and using a service to make the rss. But I’m tired of it, so I’ll spend a couple of days putting everything together. I’ll be pleased to just chose a video, feed it into my script and then forgetting it until my podcast app notifies me about “new episodes that “u/mvpetri-cast has released”
I have never used any of those. Though that is one of the secret joys of finding other solutions part way through a project: going "Ok next time I'm learning this thing too, then I'll be able to do more work more easily".
I just literally did my first pyautogui program. Cool can't wait tl read more about it if possible.
It is incredible easy to do that with pyautogui. There is a method where it shows the current x and y position, so you can do it and make a note where you want to click, set some timers if needed and it will do it nicely 
Thanks to your work, someone’s Tesla just smacked into something stupid. Keep it up :D
I'm a little confused, what mouse movements were the bot sending? The video to me looked like all the bot did was solve the audio captcha, does it also click the "I'm a human" box and fill in the result?
Actually I would use the screenshot/compare function since UIs get moved easily, but if you keep an image of what button is supposed to be pressed it's more reliable even if the position is moved.

Yea, I thought so, I'm considering Minimum Edit Distance as well. I'll look into that.
Thanks alot. I'm gonna check it.
Thanks. yea, I'm aware that this is very inefficient way to do this. I'm considering Minimum Edit Distance as well. I'll look into that.
Sounds cool! Glad you found those OOP tuts helpful
First of all thanks, finally some feedback. I knew about the enumerate but I don't know Why I haven't used it, will do it soon. Yes that's what I think that I should some how remove code duplication. Like I am getting name of the tournament in all the three functions and also other thing. Will optimize the code the moment I get some time. I have used argparse before but haven't used any other parser so decided to go for docopt and while I was using I actually felt that I shouldn't have used it :) Right Now I am more focused on my GSoC project so I think I'll make some other stuff after GSoC.

Do you use speech recognition API or did you make your own model?
If you use the default selenium driver it can be detected
The data you have seems like it should be immutable. I would use NamedTuples or attrs.org (frozen) or data classes (frozen), or my favorite data structure library: https://github.com/tobgu/pyrsistent
Python 3.6 has `random.choices` which also accepts a list of weights, for making weighted random choices. The problem is determining how large the value needs to be to begin with, and how much to decrement by. Even weighted random choices can still produce duplicates if the weights aren't far enough apart &gt;&gt;&gt; random.choices(['A', 'B', 'C'], weights=[5, 10, 5], k=10) ['B', 'A', 'A', 'B', 'C', 'B', 'B', 'B', 'B', 'B'] A simple (maybe silly) solution is to pre-sort the list. Now pick the first one, rotate the list (put the first one to the end of the list), and shuffle just the tail (last half) of the list... Then repeat. import random def rotate(l, n): return l[n:] + l[:n] def get_word(): global wordset next_word = wordset[0] # Get top word wordset = rotate(wordset, 1) # Rotate list by 1 tail = int(len(wordset) / 2) # Get tail length (last half of list) wordset[tail:] = random.sample(wordset[tail:], tail) # Shuffle the tail return next_word wordset = ['enlarge', 'private', 'sustain', 'feature', 'pottery', 'portion', 'surface', 'concert', 'monster', 'missile', 'anxiety', 'convert', 'symptom', 'freedom', 'referee', 'forward', 'extinct', 'dentist', 'texture', 'pumpkin', 'confine', 'fitness'] random.shuffle(wordset) for _ in range(250): word = get_word() print(word) It's not perfect (ie. there's a very slim chance a word could endlessly get stuck in the tail) but I tested and the distribution was not too bad... probably good enough for your game.
Very helpful I will see if this works in my code. Getting kinda late here. Thank you!!!
I really like his approach, but computing the error2 words is memory intense. Since there are so many possibilities, it might be better to compute minimum error distance between the input word and every word in the dictionary. 
so you're the reason why these shits keep getting harder smh

Trying to predict Pitchfork album scores using sentiment analysis with Pitchfork dataset.
Maybe that would warrant a bug bounty of reported?
Instead of `except Exception as e:` and listing exceptions you'd like to re-raise, accept an exception type or tuple of exception types to retry on. Anything else is an immediate failure. Also `local['exc'] = e` is dangerous as the traceback contains previous stack frames, after the failure that starts to include previous exceptions which includes previous stackframes. You should add a `local['exc'] = None` before entering the try block to clear that out. Additionally declaring this in the decorator factory rather at the execution time makes this dangerously thread unsafe. You also forgot to reset the retry counter at each run, so this'll begin randomly failing with old data. I don't think your tests uncovered this since you never reuse the same decorated function more than once. I don't think `:param self: instance, if applicable` is useful at all. I can't think of a situation where it'd be needed unless you start fussing around with descriptors and applying decorators ontop of descriptors can be maddening and isn't reliable with staticmethods in Py2 (py3 is slightly easier). More of an aside, something I don't ever see done is using timedelta with backoffs. It seems obvious to me, but maybe I'm a weirdo. I also don't see a lot of support for cancelation tokens either, though it could probably be faked with a creative object passed to both retries and wait func. 
Thank you! :)
Word Embeddings offer semantic similarity between words 
f-strings are a terrible idea. 1. Make Python code not backwards-compatible with earlier interpreters. 2. Most code intellisense tools don't work with them, they tremendously complicate language grammar, which is already unnecessarily difficult, making it less likely that new alternative implementations of Python or projects like Cython will be created in the future. 3. They create long strides of text which are difficult to break apart, making code formatting more problematic, especially if you try to do this automatically. 4. Their syntax is problematic and not entirely obvious. For instance, without executing this code, can you tell if this any of this will work: foo = 42 print(f'{f' 'oo}') print(f'{f' f'oo}') print(f'{f' + f'oo}') End then explain to a new comer why this works or doesn't, and try convincing them that this is a worthwhile feature. Seeing how a similar thing creates tons of indecipherable mess in PHP or Ruby... and now Python doing the same stupid mistake, because learning from mistakes others make has never worked for anyone.
Whoa... this is a huge subject, and it is as poorly researched as it is huge. Off hand, I don't know about any common knowledge ontology beside Cyc: http://www.cyc.com/ (they used to open-source some of their stuff), but it's not in Python. I'm afraid that if you are looking for a pre-packaged and easy solution to your problem, you are up for disappointment. The keywords to your web-search would be "ontology" "common knowledge" "knowledge representation formats" "rdf" "semantic web" and such... but that a long research project you are doing, not a weekend's hobby project.
You will probably need to use the Paypal API. I don't know the details, but investigate that.

I think there's two "bots" here - the audio captcha solver, and then another gui-automation one that clicks on stuff and then starts the solver. I'm guessing that printing the solved numbers to the console is just for our benefit, and the numbers are also passed to the gui bot behind the scenes. OP, please correct me if this is wrong.
&gt; I have a list of Ip's (100 plus) in the format IP:PORT in a text file. can I use this list as a single request AFAIK, no. You can only use libraries like gevent to run more requests in parallel.
ad 1) But this is often not a problem. In my team, we only develop internal company tools. So the code will not run with earlier interpreters, because it doesn't need to. I also control the interpreter installation so I install the one I want. ad 4) You could create tricky code with any feature. IMHO f-strings look visually more intuitive than the other two methods. I mean in normal usage, you could abuse anything of course.
Are the combination methods in itertools actually more efficient or just shorter syntax?
!RemindMe 3 days
Which is why I said Illusion 100.... meaning that the whole concept of a captcha is now pointless because clearly, a bot is capable of solving the problem that allegedly only humans are meant to be able to solve.
1. You cannot overload assignment in Python, so your `y = x` case is not possible. 2. You actually can extend `int` class to get all those magic methods with more or less suitable implementations. Consider also that a more useful system of units would involve having translation tables for units, eg. seconds to minutes, minutes to hours etc. It would also be handy to know that some units, like, for example 1 Newton = 1 kg * m / s^2, so if you had numbers with appropriate units to begin with, you might want to translate that into more appropriate units, alternatively, you could, say that the same thing is measured in Pascals (to which you can translate Newtons by doing simple algebra, no new information required). Or you may want to convert between Imperial and SI units etc.
Would love a link!
If you want to go with permutations, it might be more efficient to only compute permutations on the misspelled words, not the whole dictionary. This leverages the fact that most words in a document (assuming you are running on a document) will be spelled correctly. Something like: - for each word in the document - if it is spelled correctly (matches a dictionary word), continue - else generate all permutations of word using letter substitutions. If any of these are dictionary matches , suggest them as corrections.

I would argue the exact opposite, because you don't have to learn how to learn the format specification syntax to know what's going on. To me, &gt;'{:&lt;12.2f}' Is clearly less readable than str() + and * . But it's just personal preference anyway...

You need to look at accessibility hooks. That'll give you highlighted text and allow you to pop up a box. You'll need to be running a daemon too. You won't be able to make something Linux, Mac and Windows compatible easily. That said, I think there may be a way to do it with QT. I once saw a clever accessibility app using QT and used QT bindings to native protocols and was related to TTS for the visually impaired. Its been so long I don't know if its a viable route still or what the damn thing was called. Regardless, if you're asking the questions you are, you're probably well out of your depth trying to take on this task. Best of luck if you do!
Builtins are different. List and True are built-in primitives. True is even special in that it's a singleton. List has a syntax for itself. Pretty sure PEP doesn't apply to things that are literally hardcoded into the language and its implementation
what hwatehattehefck Do you mean you can crack reCaptcha ?
Java and Python are two different worlds apart. The only way to integrate them is via inter-process communication. That's what py4j does, it uses sockets and an internal protocol. Jython is a different story, it runs Python code on the JVM, so your python code will be the guest, and the Java application will be the host. You can do fine with REST, or even by invoking a Java application as a subprocess and collecting the outputstream.
Nah, the secret sauce is that auditory captchas are always really easy to solve. Even for computers, and they kind of have to be unless you want to stonewall the visually impaired.

AM TRYING to populate a list with records from an SQL dataset using an Sql query, My Boss said the code is not conventional and i shld rewrite the code in order to optimize the code... 
For #1 and #2 - in this case no new features would be ever created because tools do not support them beforehand. This is a cost of progress. For #3 - Then maybe formatting this text in code is a bad idea to begin with. If anything fstrings make it clearer what goes where even if at expense of length. `%s %d %s %s %s %f` is very compact and at the same time totally unreadable. We find ourselves counting damn variables only to figure out what goes where. For #4 - no syntax is ever obvious before one learns it. Syntax of fstrings is pretty simple though. `{source:format}` where format is from good old printf.
Your code is still not indented properly.

That would be easily mitigated using something like UglifyJS, right? Also the guy you linked to actually explained it can be mitigated by a chromium source code change and also by editing chromedriver.exe in a hex editor.
Oh boy. Ok well it's still not formatted correctly. The code after the for loop should have four more spaces such that for d in data: internal += [ ['']*4] ... Next, if you're going to ask for help at least do the work to help those helping you. And finally, just do your homework. If you don't understand it, take a late and talk with the teacher. If you don't want to talk to the teacher, then fine, but own up to the situation you put yourself in. 
What they mean is that even if you need to do a lot of string formatting, you will probably find it makes a difference between a response time of 50 ms and 49.9 ms, or something like that. F-strings are really cool, and you should definitely use them where appropriate, but scalability isn't why.
Now you're doing engineering you need to develop a data-based approach to problems. Example: You've only learned Python and it's your first langauge. Yet you say it is one of the best languages to learn? How do you know? This is the difference between art and engineering. Engineering requires data to make decisions.
You should do a comparison with backoff in the readme.
&gt; However when it comes to translatable strings [...] .format is way too powerful (it allows arbitrary attribute and item access) I don't think that's going to be a problem, since you will just be inserting either strings or numbers into them anyway, so translators will just not use that part.
As mentioned, been in the web industry for over 8 years. I have seen numerous PHP, JavaScript, c++ and other languages I have no clue about. I think I am familiar with engineering as I did mechanical for my degree lol, anyhow thanks for the input. Will keep the difference between art and engineering in mind. 
It would depend a lot on what kind of Java code you were actually trying to use and how. I usually interact with java code by invoking a new process, calling a REST API, receiving a REST API call or publishing/subscribing to messages on an MQ.
&gt; I don't think that's going to be a problem, since you will just be inserting either strings or numbers into them anyway, so translators will just not use that part. It's absolutely a problem, because you can't assume every single translatable string is going to be reviewed individually before being exported, so this can be leveraged by a malicious actor.
2nd question: You can easily do concurrent requests with `concurrent.futures`: make a function that does a single item use a ThreadPoolExecutor to map over it.
I really like format for more complex replacements. I use % for easier tasks.
I'm looking to run tasks on the server from web input, I mostly want the web input as convenience since the other option is coding on my machine upload to git and then sync on the server to execute the new file. Security isn't that big a deal since if people can access the web interface they can access the server. I will update the post with a clearer description of what I want.
If you want to make sure all words are picked at least once before there are any repeats, you could do something like this: def generate_words(): wordset = ['enlarge', ... insert words here ... ] while True: random.shuffle(wordset) yield from wordset wordgenerator = generate_words() def newword(): words.set(next(wordgenerator)) If you want to make sure no single word shows up twice in a row: import collections def generate_words(): wordset = ['enlarge', ... insert words here ... ] # use another number instead of 2 to make sure that # to make sure no word shows up twice in more than # that number of turns, so for example maxlen=3 # would also prevent freedom -&gt; dentist -&gt; freedom last_picks = collections.deque(maxlen=2) next_pick = None while True: while next_pick not in last_picks: next_pick = random.choice(wordset) yield next_pick last_picks.append(next_pick) wordgenerator = generate_words() def newword(): words.set(next(wordgenerator)) 
What is there to leverage, though? &gt;&gt;&gt; '{.strip}'.format('hello') '&lt;built-in method strip of str object at 0x033D2F40&gt;' Oh no, now the user knows the memory address of a string object! And if there is no review process, you have bigger problems, since malicious translators could just translate any old string to have a different meaning (like translate "quit without saving" as "save and quit", for example).
Indent with four spaces: s = '''blah blah blah blah blah {math.pi}\n blah blah blah\n blah blah more blah''' Although your example should really have been s = f'''blah blah blah blah blah {math.pi} blah blah blah blah blah more blah'''

That's like calling `math.cos` redundant because you can achieve the same effect with `math.sin(x + math.pi / 2) `.
Operations that load from the disk will be slower obviously, but otherwise you should be fine.
Check out https://pypi.org/project/units/. Note that in Python, assignment is simply rebinding, so: &gt;&gt;&gt; y = x &gt;&gt;&gt; y is x False ... can never happen in single-threaded Python, no matter the type of `x`.
It's still not that clear what you want. Can you give an example of a script you might write/exercute? Just the general gist of it...

Why is code so complicated? What is `sklearn` doing that a simple `np.polyfit` + `np.polyval` couldn't do?
You want *less* random, not *more* random. It is perfectly random to get duplicates or gaps and there is no relation between different random choices.
It was more for illustration purposes. There is more than one way to get the regression results...
I'm trying to figure out why sklearn was used when it's the statsmodels output that he uses in the end. As a regular user of statsmodels I'm wondering why I would ever use scikit-learn as part of this workflow? Was it just to show different ways to do the same thing? Also it looks like the GUI could look a lot better by using left align maybe so that the fixed width font does it's job to align columns.

Take a look in the new Data Classes added in the 3.7 version: [https://hackernoon.com/a\-brief\-tour\-of\-python\-3\-7\-data\-classes\-22ee5e046517](https://hackernoon.com/a-brief-tour-of-python-3-7-data-classes-22ee5e046517)
The only way to is to write a translator. Make a java app that calls the java API and presents (say) a json interface to python. It could either be a persistent service (i.e. running as a server somehow, including a web server) or a command line invocation thing. It depends on your needs.
Typically yes.
Then you probably meant that Python is one of the "easiest" languages to learn, or one of the most beginner friendly languages. Software devs are a little sensitive about programming language comparisons. :D
In addition to my critical comment I just wanted to say good job! You made a thing, wrote a blog, and shared it with the world, which is more than I've ever done. This also is a reminder to me that the starting point for a GUI teal can be just the text output like this. I tend to start with some crazy complicated end result in mind and bog down before I get a useful tool.
This is a pretty bizarre response to be honest. Clearly it *is* one of the best languages to learn if it *inspires people to learn programming*. So many potential programmers have been turned off the whole idea because someone tried to shove C or Java down their throats right from the start. If Python grabs someones attention when they just went looking for something by themselves, then it's exactly as OP says: one of the best languages to learn. Objectively speaking, (as you obviously know, despite coming on strong with the devil's advocate argument), it's a very useful and relevant language to learn. It is ubiquitious in cloud, data science, *science*, systems administration etc. etc. Someone coming from writing CSS should absolutely be encouraged into Python as a *learning language with excellent applicability to real world problems*. If they keep going and really catch the programming bug, then they can tackle Haskell or Java later.
Got it! The pandas workflow is to read from a data source into a pandas object called a DataFrame. Manipulating the DataFrame does not affect the original data source. However, you can write a DataFrame back to certain sources, though it would not happen automatically. Here are the functions for [reading into a DataFrame](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/api.html#input-output), and here are the functions for [writing out from a DataFrame](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/api.html#id12).
I find your response equally bizarre. We agree there's nothing wrong with learning Python. However, I don't see how the OP can say Python is the very best, when the OP has no experience of learning any other language.

&gt; XML ... Good performance for large data set. &gt; JSON ... Performance is not good when dataset is huge. Really? Are you implying that writing/parsing XML is faster than writing/parsing JSON? Have you got any benchmarks to proof it? &gt; JSON ... Program usually needs to load all data into memory first. Usually, but not always. JSON stream parsers/writers exist as well.
Yes, it was to show different ways to do the same thing. I personally prefer to work with statsmodels when it comes to applying linear regression... I originally applied left justify, but it didn't look that good. I will definitely improve the look of the GUI in the near future. It is more functional at this point...

&gt; However, I don't see how the OP can say Python is the very best, when the OP has no experience of learning any other language. The OP should instead say something like "I enjoy this, and it's working for me. I am making progress". Why is that a relevant or important distinction for someone new expressing a burst of enthusiasm for programming? Who speaks like that ever? And why should they? They didn't at any point say it was objectively the very best. It is subjectively, in the context of OP's first foray into real programming, better than the other languages they have come in contact with. Therefore, it is good to learn. Therefore *they* find it one of the best to learn, because it's the one that made them *want* to learn. What's bizarre is to fixate on the semantics of that one irrelevant point in the context of this kind of post. Pedantic arguments on the best overall learning language are better left for StackOverflow, not a Python newbie's post in the Python subreddit.
Not really. math.cos does not introduce special syntax.

I wanted to use this in Windows script, I had a bash script function that worked well, but I gave up on trying to use the same function in python using pyreadline. Requirements are bash binary, which is easy to get via [chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/). But apparently bash is maybe provided by [cmder](http://cmder.net) or [msys2](https://www.msys2.org/). I should probably do 'Ideal Windows dev env' at next python meetup.
Well as a person who did a tour of programming languages with no background in programming or engineering what so ever, and at 36 for the record, I can tell you that I found python by far the easiest programming language to learn. I have looked at, chronologically, swift, php, sql,JavaScript (web), python, node(backend), cypher, go, java, c, and c++ Of all these languages python was the easiest and t is hardly a surprise since there is almost consensus on that python is easy if not the easiest for a beginner to start was. I think you can argue that python is not the most functional, or efficient, or well written or any other thing and it would be a perfectly reasonable argument. Except for how easy it is, python is easy and perhaps the easiest. If you know an easier one. I would like to see it 
I usually use JSON because a package is built-in with python, and it's human readable. configparser is a good library to parse ini files, and it's even easier to use than JSON.
&gt; I really don't want this to end up having a negative effect Send it to Google, at least, so they can adapt to it.
Well... I didn't expect this
1\) That's the cost of progress in a language like Python. You must be already managing your runtime environment tightly so I don't see any reason why this should be a major problem. I bet that you don't like the new async features too. Following this idea we would be trapped in Python2. 2\) WTF. PyCharm support them. VScode support them. Sublime extensions support them. So does Cython and Pypy. 3\) They often make text \_\_shorter\_\_ to read and where they doesn't a ".format\(\)" call is obvious. 4\) Following your logic you probably want to remove parenthesis from IF statements because you can create a fucking giant unreadable expression if you want to. List comprehensions too. Lambda functions too. Your idea is completely non\-sense because in the vast majority of use cases they are simpler to read.
The gayest stuff is always implemented in Python for some reason.

I'm about 3 weeks in trying to learning python in my spare time \(a couple nights a week I give it some hard effort\). I have been writing very simple and stupid little programs just to test out what I've learned... Like import this CSV file, and tell me a bunch of stuff about it, write the results to a text file or console, stuff like that. I just discovered pandas and holy crap it's awesome. I just made a list of 6 projects to do for work that will be immensely helpful \(i run a small business\)...I coded one in 2 hours on friday and it works perfectly. A task that used to take me about 15 minutes is now 15 seconds. I am starting to get my feet wet in django as well because I really need that for a couple big projects later on. I desperately need a portal for my clients so hoping to use that goal to learn and create something wicked. All the quotes I've had for it are about 100k all in, so saving some or all of that money would be just dandy.
&gt;Enaml just looks like a wrapper for Qt's QML language Yes, enaml conceptually inherits from QML, but uses Qt widgets, not QML

You’ve answered with quotes. 
I've tried without it, trust me. It still answers with the else statement.
Yes, I agree with the JS part too.
By sharing code in an image instead of pasting it using markdown formatting, or linking to a pastebin/gist.
Try again and link the output. Replying 'Yes' to input() will result in "'Yes'" being stored. (A string with five characters: ', Y, e, s, and ')

RemindMe! 6 days 
I’m 50 and just started on my Python journey. 
Here is the output when I try without quotes: https://pastebin.com/Xx2cVvha
When you ran the app, you entered **'**Yes**'** in quotation marks. `input()` in Python 3 doesn't do any processing on the line of text you entered (like Python 2's `raw_input()`), so `Quest_answer` was set to `"'Yes'"`, which is not equal to `'Yes'`. If you're used to how `input()` worked in Python 2 (treating the text you entered as a Python expression), you can get the same effect in Python 3 by doing `eval(input(&lt;prompt&gt;))`. Avoid doing this if it's possible for your input to come from an untrusted person, because an "expression" can contain code to do anything that the Python interpreter has permission to do.
OK, so let's say that exists, what's to stop me stumbling on your site and doing: git push origin --delete master
Whenever I try without quotes it still does not work. I've tried with all of my acceptable answers, btw.
Yuri is the best DDLC character if you disagree you're simply WRONG
Well it's only published on a local network it's a build/automation server so that doesn't concern me to much
What do you see if you print the value of Quest_answer after you store your input in it?
Are you typing it wothout spaces in the same case? (Also, you should just use .lower() for string comparisons so that you dont have to test for multiple cases
What do your friends call you? Foster Pleased to meet you, Foster Do you want to go on a quest, Foster Yes Then get out of my presence! Yes 
The yes is the Print(Join) code
To start I’d eliminate the both “or” from your if statement and then answer with Yes
Where’s the checkbox for “I am a robot”? Cmon google!
Yeah. Could you provide an example of how I would use .lower()? (I'm new to this, "just" starting)
When you ran the program, did you type a space before "Yes"? The code that you've shared doesn't print a space there, and if you typed it, it will be part of the input that the program sees.
It still answers with the Else statement
I just ran this code and it worked.
Oh, thank you. This is the answer. What should I do with the thread?
Just went to ask that
One thing to consider is that if you are importing user-edited files, it might be a security risk because they could just put whatever code they want in the init function. If people ever wanted to make your program into an exe, you wouldn't want to be importing python code.
The units are just metadata. I don’t intend to ever use them in my calculations, but it’s nice to have that available when I’m running things interactively in Jupiter as a quick sanity check or if I forgot. 
Alright can I ask why I’m being downvoted for this? Like it makes me not want to bother helping other people with questions here because you guys are all so fucking hostile. 
u/undercoveryankee figured it out for me. On another note, is there any way to end the code after the Else statement?
Normally, I'd recommend leaving it up in case it helps someone else who's had the same problem. In this particular case, moderators will probably take it down soon because it should have been posted on /r/learnpython instead of here, so it's fine if you want to delete it yourself.
Oooh alright, I'll be sure to post there. Thanks!
["Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could that they didn't stop to think if they should."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nazm3_OXac) 
An example of using `string.lower()` here would be for checking `Join`: ... if Join.lower() == 'yes': # checks for 'Yes', 'yes', 'YES', etc print('Get your stuff ready') else: print('Oh well.')
i feel like it's simpler than that, it looks like they're just adding 100% transparency to the white mask on top of the pattern 
I see
Because 24 * 60 * 60 is not the same as 25 * 60 * 60? Specifically the first term. Also, /r/learnpython.
There is 24 hours in a day, why are you trying 25 on the calculator 
But I insist, if you have a unit-annotated value class and you ignore the unit when comparing values, it'll hurts the semantics of your abstraction. If it was me, I would do something like: s1 = Scalar(100, "m^2") s2 = Scalar(100, "m/s") s1 == s2 -&gt; False s1.value == s2.value -&gt; True This is the easy part. You will have to implement the whole symbolic math behind the scenes: Scalar(100, "m^2") + Scalar(10, "m^2") -&gt; Scalar(110, "m^2") Scalar(10, "m") * Scalar(10, "m") -&gt; Scalar(100, "m^2") Scalar(100, "m") / Scalar(10, "s") -&gt; Scalar(10, "m/s") Scalar(100, "m/s") * 2-&gt; Scalar(200, "m/s") by overriding the operators. If you consider complex numbers you are even more screwed. Or consider vector quantities. It would be amazing having such class implemented.
Wow didn't know Luno was known outside of....hang on are you South African?
Without seeing any code, but based solely on your variable names, it appears you're doing something weird in the global and class scopes. What is `Problem`? `Problem.spec = Spectrum(Signal.get_parameters())` implies you have three different class definitions and are using class-level attributes to modify their state. Assuming that's true `Problem.specs[0].find_residuals()` is probably doing some inefficient calculations/lookups compounding smaller problems in your code design. We can't help you unless you post source code. /r/learnpython

Should be in /r/learnpython . 1. You compare int to string \(answer is an int, "1" is a string\). Either don't convert input to int or compare to 1 instead `if answer == 1: #do stuff`. 2. You don't close the bracket for `int` function. Just add another closing bracket where you convert input to int for an answer.

I would like to post source code, but besides being sorta\-confidential, there are about 600 lines of code just for those 2 methods. The process is extremely complex mathematically, and it has taken me several months to write and debug in probably not\-the\-most\-efficient\-way, so I will try to condense the problem here: `Problem` is a class that saves a bunch of floats, a `Signal` and a `Spectrum`. This class is being expanded, but right now it has 2 methods, one of which is &gt;get\_spectrum\(\): args = self.signal.normalized\_arguments\(self.n\) self.spectrum = Spectrum\(self.blv, [self.trv](https://self.trv), args\) self.spectrum.calculate\_discrete\(\) self.spectrum.calculate\_dispersive\(\) Previously I altered this method to simply run over lists at each step, but even with a single element in the lists, the runtime was much larger. `normalized_arguments()` is just a bunch of simple algebra that returns a tuple with the arguments I need in the shape I need. What I called "`find_residuals()`" is the "`calculate_discrete()`" here, and this is the hard to explain part. This method uses yet another class \(`Rectangle`\) to integrate a function of args around a perimeter using the scipy` quadratur`e function. This is the most complex part and involves about 8000 small matrix multiplication steps and checks for convergence. Leaving all that aside, once the calculation converges, th`e Rectang`le instance will find two smalle`r Rectangl`es that perform the same calculation as above and also converge. This is performed iteratively until eac`h Rectang`le returns a value smaller than a given integer \(3\). With this, a list o`f Rectangl`es is formed with a given integer smaller than 3 associated. Next, similar calculations are performed with the `quadrature` function but this time using polynomials that use the associated integer. This returns a number of sets of coordinates. As a final step, these coordinates are refined using scipy `optimize` method and returned as a list of tuples. This list is saved as a `Spectrum` attribute.
Do tell, why should I not take Microsoft's history into account, both in regards to open source, and acquisitions. After all, Skype, OneDrive, and Nokia went so well for them!

This is explained [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/enum.html#enum-member-type) in the docs. The idea is that the enum members are instances of the class, so that you can define properties/methods/etc. on them. To leverage this behavior, just make your enum a subclass of an additional class. The prototypical example, an `IntEnum`, same as your example, is shown [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/enum.html#others) in the docs, and is actually built-in to the `enum` module.
Microsoft is a nicer version of Oracle. It's not much to have. 
Sorry I'm late to reply to this. Thanks for the awesome feedback! I've already changed a few things based on your feedback and am going to fix up the README more when I have time. In regards to the last statement about makefiles: Yeah, sortof, when it comes to the specific examples I used above. But there's more to it than that I think. For one, `make` does not handle command-line arguments well. Plus setting a global alias to a single letter is a bit restricting. For example, I use localalias to set `b` to open up my books-to-read.txt in vim when I'm in the directory that holds all of my notes. So I wouldn't want to waste `b` my assigning it to a global alias. Thanks again for the feedback! Best I've gotten so far!

We moved all our company repositories to gitlab about 2 months ago, the reason was mostly their good ci/cd setup and integration (without paying for all those things separately). Would we have moved if GitHub was still working for us. Hell no. Will I move my own projects? Hell no. I still remember how crazy people got when Facebook bought whatsapp, in the end I ended up giving just more companies my info and now I still use whatsapp but the others are all gone. Main reason: most people didn't move. The same will happen here I think. Also when Microsoft bought Mojang, people where screaming about the death of Linux support.. still works fine. Don't listen to other people, make your own decisions.
Creepy.. but cool.
Forcing myself to learn finally...unfortunately my first "oh this will be easy project" is probably more than I could handle. I get these daily reports of URLs visited by all the systems on the network. I want to basically ingest these via a script and spit out only the stuff I care about. Right now, I am already annoyed/frustrated at the learning process, but I will power through.
This is the bones I came up with based on what you said above. class Problem: def __init__(self): self.blv = None # ?? self.trv = None # ?? self.n = None # ?? self.spectrum = None # type: Spectrum self.signals = None # type: Signal def get_spectrum(signal=None): pass class Signal: def __init__(self): pass def normalized_arguments(self, n): pass class Spectrum: def __init__(self, blv, trv, *args): self.blv = blv self.trv = trv self.args = args def calculate_discrete(self): pass def calculate_dispersive(self): pass Now, without knowing any of the implementation details I can already see a few problems; some of which are causing your computation overhead. 1) Are `Signal`, `Spectrum` and `Problem` really discrete objects? It appears like you're using the to isolate functionality, which is fine, but they're all so intertwined are they *really* different things? If a `Problem` has a single spectrum, and a spectrum is contructed from a signal, then at most you have two objects `Problem` and `Spectrum`, where `Signal` is just a definition of values that instantiate a `Spectrum` instance. 2) When you switched from a 1:1:1 relationship between your three classes and went instead to list of instances I believe you're recalculating each `Spectrum` (or `signal`?) when you want to retrieve them from the list. Your `get_spectrum` above appears to be a lookup, but it's not, it's a re-calculation. 3) If you have to run all your `calculate_` functions when an instance of `Spectrum` is created, why aren't they just a part of the creation step? Same thing with `Problem.get_spectrum`. It appears you could simplify everything by changing the `Problem` specification: problems = [] def _iterate_attr(iterable, attr): for o in iterable: inst = getattr(o, attr, None) if inst is not None: yield inst all_signals = partial(_iterate_attr, problems, 'signal') all_spectrums = partial(_iterate_attr, problems, 'spectrum') class Problem: def __init__(self, signal): self.signal = signal self.spectrum = self.build_spectrum(signal) @classmethod def from_spectrum(cls, spectrum): # .. work .. prob = cls(None) prob.spectrum = spectrum return prob @classmethod def build_spectrum(cls, signal): if signal is None: return None # .. work .. # .. work .. return Spectrum(blv, trv, signal_args) Then you're not repeating re-calculation work, it's done once on Problem instantiation, and you can iterate its attributes independent of one-big-problem (pun intended) class.

You mean their history of releasing thousands of opensource projects? Or are you stuck 20 years in the past? You know 20 years ago before a whole change of management at Microsoft. 20 years ago when you would be hard-pressed to find opensource running in any business other than webhosting?
The flakey P2P video conferencing software? 
 new_string = "".join(c for c in old_string if c.isdigit())
Ooh, this looks fun! s = '000\-000' t = ''.join\(\[c for c in s if c != '\-'\]\)
Best answer, wanted to reply same method but you got here 1st.
Thx. Np. Up voted you because you would have given the same solution 😉
 new_string = old_string.translate({45:None}) 
Microsoft is a very different company, or wants to be a very different company, than the company that bought Skype and Nokia.
Do you think Microsoft is still the same company 20 years later?
Uhhh cool...
Leetcode seems to be the go-to for interview type questions. Otherwise, you should find a project/idea you are interested in and start working on it.
Yes. More so, in fact, and their behavior remains consistent, inside and out. Lazy minds will say 'but what about X?', while Microsoft makes moves like this. 
I think there's a lot of FUD going around this acquisition. Microsoft has a lot of incentive to not fuck up github, mostly the goodwill of every developer using it. While I'm still on the fence about Microsoft's actual motivations, I'm willing to extend the benefit of the doubt to them. This isn't Gates or Ballmer running the ship anymore.

Well nevermind then. Move off Azure, no VSCode either I guess. And obviously you can't use github anymore. But hey, living in the past is cool too.
They also use it internally. And have made/released some good tools for huge repos. But I do mean huge, like the entire windows codebase type huge.
Really awesome work
Finally not stuck with Skype. ZOOM was a better fit. 
That's terrifying and awesome at the same time
This should be in /r/learnpython 
thank you, it worked.
You should probably start by reading the sidebar.
The source code for it is a bit of a WTF. It works and I use it, but it wasn't well designed.
Well python has huge amount of libraries. You can do anything using the right library. As for your question , as far as i know you can start creating games using pygame. Just check it once. Hope this helps you.
Gotta be able to wank at an angle
If your preferred future is Microsoft, I don’t know what to tell you. 
It’s possible to live in the present without using those, actually.
Since you are asking for references/a portfoilio instead of money, did you consider just building a site and telling people you wrote it?
Maybe check out CITA. They regularly have charities looking for people to build them websites/donor databases etc. Obviously they might not be looking for a solution in Python, but that's not a bad thing, as a programmer who can only code in Python is basically worthless to any real business \(I'm a "Python programmer", but I easily spend 30\-40&amp;#37; of my time writing/reviewing/debugging code in PHP/Java/Bash/C\). Obviously there's also a load of sysadmin work available too. One note: don't force Python into a non\-Python environment, unless you want your references to be "Do not hire; complete and utter moron". If they want a Wordpress site, give them a Wordpress site \- it will be better for them and better for your career. As a rule I have a "Don't work for free" rule, as if you don't value your own skills, how can you expect other people to, but charity work gets a pass.
You need to build an SSCE http://sscce.org/ Short, self-contained, complete example I'm not going to make blind guesses as to what your code does.
My preferred future is whoever is providing the best tools/service. If some of that is Microsoft with Github, if some of that is Amazon with AWS, if some of that is Google with Gmail and sheets and whatever, if some of that is Apple for an iphone. Then so be it. I don't see why I would rule out one particular company.
Nobody said you had to. Your confusing my opinion with something you have to believe or prove wrong.
&gt;I think there's a lot of FUD going around this acquisition. I am inclined to agree. In general, it's a good idea IMO for people to be aware of ownership changes to software or sites that they use. Microsoft\-specific concerns aside, it's not uncommon for features and benefits to change after such an acquisition. Whether that be for better or for worse, is up to the user to decide. Ultimately, git is a free and open source system. The worst case scenario here is that something undesirable happens with the social or collaborative parts of the site, in which case it is simple enough to migrate in most cases.
Sad if true.
