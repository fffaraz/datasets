Are you looking to create web applications or desktop? For web I would recommend Plotly Dash (https://plot.ly/products/dash/). Although its mainly meant for analytics dashboards, you can do much more with it. I have personally not created any desktop applications but I've heard good things about https://www.qt.io/qt-for-python 
Just curious why you use virtualenv if you are also using docker?
yeah, I would not consider those people credible. the internet allows any idiot to get the same exposure as anyone, so it's up to the individual to filter the nonsense out for themselves.
Taken from /u/twillisagogo great template: General * Editor: whatever you want to use (I use VS Code with `flake8`/`black`) * Source Control: `git`/Github * Planning: JIRA * Team Communication: Slack * CI/CD: Jenkins * Deployable Unit: Docker for dev/CI, Kubernetes for QA/Prod * Production Environment: on site/GCE * Production Database: GCE Postgres * Production Monitoring: `newrelic` Python Specific * version: python 3.6.x for new stuff, some legacy still on 2.7.x * dependency mgmt: `pip`/`pip-tools` * db interaction: Django * http request routing: Django and nginx * exploring: Django / [shell_plus](https://django-extensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/shell_plus.html) * serialization: Django Rest Framework * app server: `uwsgi` * test data: Django * test runner: `py.test`/`tox` 
Sure, but let's also understand that most publicly traded businesses play the short game. 
Because in Dev mode you generate environment often not in docker.
I am probably the edge case here. Developing tools for 3D applications that run on windows and mac. Only time I deal with linux, is for work that has to deal with batch processing on our servers. 
I smiled and face-palmed. Nice work :)
as I said above in my list. docker is used for deployment b/c of our use of ecs, that doesn't mean I have to use it for development other than maintaining the respective docker files. I dont see any upside over virtualenv that would compensate for the added complexity other than what has been marketed. &amp;#x200B; the bulk of my workflow is &amp;#x200B; * run \`pserver --reload dev.ini\` * edit code/test from what I understand, docker images are immutable which means each time code/dependencies change I must rebuild the image before I run it, unless I do something like mount a external directory in the image just for development purposes at which point an immutable docker image with a mutable external directory offers no benefit over just using virutalenv to begin with. &amp;#x200B; I might be off base on this and admittedly set in my ways to some extent. But i'd be happy to hear how docker makes the edit/reload/test better. 
General * Editor: vim/vscode * Source Control: git * Planning: Trello * Team Communication: GitHub/email (2 person team) * CI/CD: Travis * Deployable Unit: Docker * Production Environment: Amazon/ECS * Production Database: RDS/Postgres Python Specific * version: python 3.7.x * dependency mgmt: conda (work) / docker containers (personal projects) * orm: sqlalchemy * prototyping: ipython * test runner: nose
I work in QA meaning that all Python modules and scripts that I create/manage are for internal use only, and my answers will be accordingly.

In python? Mega nope.
Yeah, the whole `range(len(x))` thing should be avoided. Setting aside any efficiency concerns, we should write code that is clear and easy to read. Making a range based on the length is not as clear as using the list itself and leaves you open to making clangers by forgetting `-1` adjustments and the like.
The way I use docker in dev is to build the image with all the dependencies, then mount my local code for for dev, so yes it’s mutable but I know that the dockerfile for release is going to build with the same deps as I’m using in dev, so one less thing to go wrong. I don’t think it makes the dev process better, really, but is more of simplifying process. 
Does anyone know how to pull historical data from the coinigyV2 api? The api docs really suck. 
I agree with the "nicer to look at" argument in general, but there are a few cases where I think writing out explicit loops is better. If your list comprehension is a long, ungainly one, I feel like it's better to break it up so it's easier to read. The point at which you should do this though is probably a matter of personal preference!
&gt;but I know that the dockerfile for release is going to build with the same deps as I’m using in dev and what about other people who work on the code and need to change deps? 
Absolutely an issue but one we catch in CI - build the image and then run tests against that. 
I think this is a suboptimal way to use Docker, but maybe that’s just my opinion 
It depends why you would need to pause it. If you need it to pause at a specific point to debug for instance, you could use `import pdb; pdb.set_trace()`. This will pause execution at the line you put this on, giving you some cool stuff you can do to debug. If you need to have the script wait for a certain amount of time for some external process to happen, short of checking for the process to be completed in a while loop, you can always use `sleep` from `import time.sleep`, which lets you pause the execution at that line for a specified amount of time (in seconds). Again, this really depends what you're trying to achieve out of pausing the script. Maybe you could elaborate?
for us, CI/CD is where the docker image is made, unit tests run and then deployed to ecs for acceptance testing and promoted to production(no re-builds)
You can check out the design at https://github.com/Ulauncher/Ulauncher/ (that project is completely open source, as far as I can tell). Is there a specific part you're interested in?
We do all of our automations and data science models entirely on Windows via the IDLE and Jupiter Notebooks. 
I've worked with Python on Windows off and on since 2006 - it's more common than you think. You can absolutely run Python in production on Windows. At one job we did most of our data feeds with Python, at others (including my current job) Django websites.
I do data analysis with these tools * System: macOS / ubuntu * Python 3.6+ * Libs: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, requests, beautifulsoup, selenium * Environments: conda, docker * Editors: VScode, jupyter notebook / console, vim * Team: slack, trello, monday / asana * Virtual machines: digital ocean * Database: redshift, postgres, mongodb, s3
I dev on a Mac and deploy to Linux.

Thank you! It seems like you gave me enough information to get where I wanted to be, even if some of it did take an embarrassingly long time to realize. And as you said, most of it wasn't really related to pybind11 after all, probably more of my lack of understanding of how to build and link C++ extensions. For anyone that comes along later (or in case I need to revisit this more when applying it to the actual code) here's what I figured out so far. Not quite sure I have this all orginized as well as it could be but it seems to let me do what I was after, just include one header file for the library interface and one wrapper cpp. I made a repo here https://github.com/novice-with-qs/pybind11_question That has a my_lib folder in it with a simple-ish C++ library that can be built with cmake, set to build a static lib. NOTE TO SELF: This must have the -fPIC flag enabled, I did that by adding set_property(TARGET my_lib PROPERTY POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE ON) I build the my_lib library in a my_lib_build folder like mkdir my_lib_build cd my_lib_build cmake ../my_lib make That results in a my_lib_build/libmy_lib.a file. Then in my setup.py file I added these lines to the extension: include_dirs=['my_lib/include'], libraries=['my_lib'], library_dirs=['my_lib_build'], NOTE TO SELF: It took me an embarrassingly long time to realize that I just needed to write my_lib and not libmy_lib or libmy_lib.a or anything else like that for the libraries parameter. Then I can build the extension (first returning to the root of the repo) cd .. #to get back to the root of the repo python setup.py build_ext -i That generates a build folder and a wrap.so file in the root of the repo. Then I can just see that my test works by doing python test.py All my various library functions are doing are taking an int and returning it incremented, thus the output of the test.py Thanks again for your help!
Small nit, the samples you posted are 37%-70% faster, but take 30%-40% less time to run :) For example, if your code runs twice as fast (100% faster), it will take half as much time (50% less time).

You have a very good system, nice and mature with few holes for issues going from dev -&gt; prod. How often do releases go out?

By the way. this is the Rust twitch.. so you have a link to the channel.

Planned releases go out monthly. Hotfixes go out as needed, sometimes multiple times a day. 
Wow, I would love to see your project
Honestly you shouldn’t feel bad. Though this stuff is simple in principle it becomes extremely confusing in practice and frankly most people just give up before getting as long as you have. I have a talk a while back which has some code attached to it. You can probably skip the talk, but the code might be helpful: https://github.com/ApproximateIdentity/cpp_extension_talk Also if you’re bored I have some articles written on this sort of stuff on my website: https://thomasnyberg.com They are usually a bit niche for most people, but you might find them interesting. In any case, glad you sorted it out!
XD I was about to tag you here and suggest that the guy ask you for help but guess I didn't need to.
I get paid but they don't care how I get it done, so I use Python, neovim and git. I'm lazy with testing.
Web stuff, machine learning stuff, computer vision stuff, automation. All on Windows. I spent years on a Windows machine doing all my development in an Ubuntu VM...which works great, but one day a year or so ago I just cut out the VM and everything is fine. 
Currently using Selenium, as I just learned how to use it, and I'm using it to run the necessary JavaScript to structure the website and prepare it for scraping. I use find_element_by_xpath() and copy the xpath from Chrome's developer tools. Then I use a range() to iterate through the listings (all are just separated by div[1], div[2], etc.) And store the price, beds, baths, address, phone #, etc. If all accessible. Learning how to use .DB slowly to see if it's better than an Excel sheet .csv 👍
If it serves only one purpose make a micro service out of it, use rcp or http to build the rest api and that's it, if this service has to face the outside world place a load balancer in front of it such as ngix and spawn a couple of this processes that handle the requests. It's standard practice.
Desktop application on Windows. It's not an externally sold/used software and our department has control of the image on these pc's running the software, so we can either run the python script or freeze to an executable. The software is pretty interesting in that it talks to a lot of external systems over sockets, none of them are web servers though
I code on Windows both personally and professionally. Having coded using Red Hat before, my opinion on coding on Windows is that it's fine. I don't really get the whole thing around why Linux is seen to be the best environment for coding. That might have been true back when Bash wasn't available, but mingw does everything I need from a Bash shell, and latest versions of Windows 10 have Bash through WSL. 
Thanks for the response Menefotto -- the main program will be running on a small remote device and will be accessed by very few people, at max 5. These people will go to a web interface, authenticate and perform a request to the REST API that should trigger an action :) 
Please avoid the wild card import in your example, it makes me hunt around for what the module provides, when I would prefer clarity. 
Windows + Anaconda works very well in my experience. Been using it daily for a year or two.
A banking environment. \- Bash 4.0 on redhat 6.5. \- Linuxbrew, as we have no admin rights and we need o build our tooling by hands. \- Tmux \- Alternate between spacemacs and neovim (jedi in both cases) \- Ansible \- Gitlab \- Pytest Older projects: \- Python 2.7 on conda: conda caused us several issues when we started using python 32 and python64. As it tries to cache packages locally but does not store enough metadata to distinguish between the package origin (32 vs 64), and confuse the two together. So yes you can end up with a 32 bit library in your 64 bit python which breaks everything. We moved half the projects to vanilla python with virtualenv. \- flask, sqlalchemy. Newer Projects \- Python 3.7 with venv \- aiohttp, we love asyncio. \- sqlalchemy
Interprocess communication has quite a few choices. The most common one in use is sockets, because most projects need to support a distributed deployment. There are many options if you'd just be running locally: shared memory, pipes, etc. As you've discovered there is a multiprocessing library that abstracts away, for example the multiprocessing manager class which internally uses sockets but simplifies a lot of the low level details. The answer to this question depends on your requirements. But here are a few options: * Use multiprocessing manager and create a registry class that maintains the processes, spawns them at the right time, etc. This is simple to setup but it could get complicated depending on the types of things you're sending back and forth. Easiest to use and get going with. * Use gRPC or some other remote procedure call framework to facilitate the command and query passing. gRPC utilizes http as the transport layer and it has a serialization / deserialization layer called protobufs. This is a bit more complex than multiprocessing but still not bad. * Use a message broker, such as RabbitMQ or kafka. This is probably the one with the most programmer overhead to get going, but it's also probably the best performance and scalability of the options. 
You're welcome, forget about nginx then, just build an http server than is able to perform your users requests ...
I don't necessarily disagree, I was never sold that this feature was a good idea. however if you think comprehensions are a good idea at all, then the difference between the following comprehensions is almost literally nothing ``` [a for a in b if a] # vs [f(a) for a in b if f(a)] ``` and the fact that you can't reasonably extend from the first to the second is...unfortunate. you shouldn't be forced to switch from one construct to another (which is typical of comprehensions, so maybe they're not such a great idea)
Lot of Flask based Microservices dev for me. Deployment via Docker (into AWS). Also Lambda functions in AWS. Dev platform is mainly VSCode on Mac.
I'm a pretty experienced python developer. I really have a hard time understanding the need to comolexify something that's do simple. Can you help me better understand the practical use case being solved here? At my job I use zookeeper to maintain yaml configs that merge into each other based on a particular app and host etc, so maybe you might say I've just complexified.thibgd in my own way.
Yup very good point, will fix. If you check out the quickstart, should become clear you just need `Bonfig` and `Store`! https://0hughman0.github.io/bonfig/quickstart.html#quickstart 
Thanks for the catch! My bad I can't edit the title. I got mislead by the % number in the benchmark output.

For me the reason still sticking with full blown VM is Docker. Docker for Windows or Docker in WSL don't cut for my workflow.

I have limited understanding of the internals but from what I can understand from the issue there is a general abstraction for parsing arguments called [argument clinic](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/clinic.html) . In some of the cases the abstraction adds some overhead where you can directly check for args to be a tuple of certain length in positional argument and get the required values speeding up common cases. The abstraction comes at a cost that it's easy to write avoiding boilerplate code but there is work to make sure it's smart enough to generate code like the hand written one. I am not very sure about the problem with kwargs. There is an issue for kwargs I think that I can't find at the moment. Similar issue in bisect module where there is 25% speedup : https://bugs.python.org/issue34925 . Issue for single positional argument case https://bugs.python.org/issue23867. I could be wrong due to my limited understanding of C internals but the issues might help you.

I take your point, it's definitely want to solve the same problem as ZooKeeper, the focus is much more about bringing in your config into Python and what you do with it next. I think Bonfig's strengths only start to appear once you have a more [complex configuration](https://0hughman0.github.io/bonfig/cheatsheet.html). It allows you build up this configuration from smaller components through inheritance. It also allows you to easily pull in data from different places e.g. `.ini` `.json` environment variables, whilst accessing them all in the same way. Additionally because configurations become `Bonfig` instances, you can define methods that operate on your configuration data just like any other class, for example allowing you to write serialisation methods. And finally it lets you quickly add additional functionality when it comes to [getting and setting](https://0hughman0.github.io/bonfig/api.html#bonfig.fields.FieldDict.add) configuration values from fussy places.
Have alook at [https://spacy.io/](https://spacy.io/) , it provides spanish models too.
It worked :)
Thanks for those links. I just took a quick glance through them and they seem like they will be very useful. I'll look through them more later, especially the section about the gil since that will likely be something I'll want to deal with. From what I can see so far I think you may have hit the sweet spot with your examples that are simple without being too simple. For example a lot of the pybind11 examples I read just work with everything in one cpp file, interface, implementation and wrapping code. Which is fine I suppose but lead me down the garden path of referencing all of the cpp files which becomes problematic rather quickly. But your examples seem to have things laid out in a way that actually tries to mirror reality while still being easy to understand. I'm sure it'll take me a bit to figure out some stuff but having examples like yours to work from makes things significantly easier. Thanks again!
I use jupyter notebook as a MATLAB replacement for interactive data visualization and algorithm prototyping.
Historical reasons, I guess. The two concepts are mostly interchangeable, and the term "truthy" is actually not used in the official documentation.
I work in IntelliJ. Builds are done in Jenkins. Deployments are either in Kubernetes or debs installed with Ansible. There isn't really much of a "stack" to speak of...
Yes, so it should finish `else: return perfection(n, b-1)`
"Government work" is extremely vague, and there is no "best". [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) might be up your alley, though.
Sublime, Subversion and it runs on Ubuntu. I mostly do API integration stuff with network kit. 
I assume you haven't googled `python json`, then.
I work on embedded python.. - IDE: PyCharm - Bitbucket + git - Planning: JIRA - Team Comm: Slack - Documentation: Confluence - CI: Jenkins - Deployable: rootfs (yocto + open embedded) ARM v6, v7, v8 - Monitoring: custom - Cloud Services: custom Python: - version 3.5.3, from 3.3.1 - dependency mgmt: yocto - DB: sqlite3 + custom management - app runner: custom - app upgrades: custom - serialization: custom + modified msgpack - runtime: asyncio (3.5) from asyncore (3.3) 
I think the idea is that anyone who knows programming will know how to print/loop/whatever but their ability to plan and execute programs is more important than the language they use.
The varied config types might be useful actually - in my case ive had the luxury of demanding a unified type. &amp;#x200B; I think you are correct that we are solving complex configs in a similar way, by combining multiple configs hierarchically. i think I will use the idea of replacing config values if a environment variable for it is found. I'm not sure I needed multiple format handling yet though.
Seconding this approach. Using xpath on an XML file gives you a list of elements. A list comprehension turns that into a list of dictionaries which can then be directly formed into a dataframe with pd.DataFrame.
I think people claiming that professionals do not use tools are on the bad side of the [Dunning Kruger effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect) (competent people underestimate themselves and incompetent people overestimating themselves) 
I wrote a system that handles the university’s two hundred data integrations. We are an Oracle shop. Our system is 100% Python 3, and consists of several daemons and a console to manage them. We have a group of four that sustains the operations. 
**Dunning–Kruger effect** In the field of psychology, the Dunning–Kruger effect is a cognitive bias in which people of low ability have illusory superiority and mistakenly assess their cognitive ability as greater than it is.

This. And sometimes the dataframe is just entirely the wrong tool for the job. Countless times I've replaced it with python lists or dicts and seen speed ups of several orders of magnitude. Because it was the wrong use case for dataframe. Particularly, any time you're iteratively inserting or modifying data as individual points, the python builtins are almost always superior. Until you need to do operations on whole datasets, and even then, sometimes numpy arrays are the solution.

Ok, now that I'm thinking about it (and yes I am starting to get so used to python I wanted to type "I\\'m") if you know a program that can spell check python, maybe coding in general, if it's easy I would appreciate it. 
Yes. Also, /r/learnpython.
I have been paid to write Python, at a job I left about 2 years ago. A couple Django projects and numerous scripts, though it was primarily a Java shop. I used Notepad++, and occasionally Vim (but only when I was working on a server, at work). The database used was Sybase SQLAnywhere (I don't recommend using it with Django). The larger of the Django projects, which was about 5 years ago, consisted of a web interface and back-end process that ran reports, mostly overnight. The back-end process used APScheduler and Matplotlib, along with a custom script to run the APScheduler as a Linux daemon. APScheduler was too easily crashed when the scheduled reports threw errors, so if I did this over again I would have just made it a cron job. The backend process used the same Django models as the website, which worked pretty well. I like Django's ORM. I haven't used code assist with Python. I use Atom now, basically because I want a cross-platform Notepad++. We used Subversion with TortoiseSVN for version control (though they've since switched to TFS -- did I say it was a Java shop? Well, the Microsoft faction was winning as of when I left). No CI/CD at the time. unittest for unit testing, though not much of it for these projects. Coding on Windows workstations. Manual deployment to RHEL servers, using WinSCP and Putty. Separate servers for staging and production. Front-end requirements weren't fancy, so it was just HTML/CSS/JS with no framework, with some JQuery to make searches ajaxy.
Thank you Guido, very cool!
In Python "truthy"/"falsey" usually means "anything convertible to `True`/`False`", not just the `True`/`False` constants. This is because being convertible to a boolean value is often an explicit part of a class API. R doesn't put emphasis on conversion to booleans.
vim on my computer, notepad++ on other computers. git-bash on my computer, cmd on other computers.
Got it, thanks 
Thanks for the insight 
"Government work" covers a lot of ground. Like...scientific? Accounting? Law enforcement? Even each of these is a huuuge field. If you want to get into programming, just start with some language. Once you learn one, the next one is 1/10th as hard to learn and the third is 1/10th of that. Also, you probably wanted r/learnpython.
Too bad I'm too lazy to go refactor all my workarounds from the past
The Console Host on Windows was terrible compared to the Terminal Emulators on Linux or macOS (macOS's is the best, IMO). I'm glad to see that ConHost has improved immensely, and (more important) that it's finally enjoying support and development. It's still lacking, of course, but the difference is not as pronounced anymore.

Embedded python? Your job would be a dream come true for me.
PyCharm remembers your interpreter's full path, including the drive letter. You need to change the path if the drive letter changes, and it probably does change between your computers.

This is an awesome book for python hobbyists that I really enjoyed. Automate the Boring Stuff with Python: Practical Programming for Total Beginners https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00WJ049VU/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_i_6BntCb7332JXC
automate the boring stuff with python would be a good follow up. 
I saw that one too. I was planning on going through that one after I finished this book and when I was a bit more comfortable. Thanks for the suggestion! Do you know of any other books that I might not have seen yet?
Thanks for the suggestion! It does look really interesting.
For my job : - Editor : Notepad++ - Source Control : Git (private Gitlab install) - Management : Kanboard (we moved away from JIRA) - Communication : Discord - Python version : 2.7.14 - Framework : Renpy SDK For myself : - Editor : Sublime Text 3 - Source Control : Git (Github when need be) - Management : Trello - Python Version : 3.6.5 (looking into installing 3.7 soon, when I find the courage to reinstall my packages) - Linting tool : pycodestyle - Tests : unittests (I'm a basic bitch) - Deploying : cxFreeze, or py2exe depending on the platform 
Hi there Grunfy, Glad you are taking up Python. If you have questions on how to use etc... there's a bunch of people you can reach out to on /r/learnpython. Have fun learning.
One theme you'll note on the below is that we have a lot of legacy software that has been written using different libraries and frameworks. Python: 2.7 for most (legacy) code, 3.5+ for new code Async: twisted Web backend: Klein (flask inspired microframework on twisted) Web frontend: mix of jQuery, angular, ember, react GUI: mix of pygtk (gtk2), pygobject (gtk3), pyqt Testing: twisted trial, pytest, tox Editor: emacs, with elpy, magit Linting: pylint Typechecking: mypy Source control: git Code review: gitlab Ticket tracking, planning: Redmine with agile plugin CI: buildbot Dev ops: Ansible Dependency management: Debian packaging using dh-python+setuptools (prod), setuptools+pip+virtualenv (dev) Packaging build system: pbuilder Virtual machines: libvirt+qemu+kvm Base OS, prod: Ubuntu 12.04 with a 16.04 update almost done (yeah, I know; our update precess turned out to be more complicated than expected, we have a heavily customized OS and high availability distributed system expected to be updated by naive users, so updates are complicated, we now have working updates and are finalizing the new release) Dev OS: Fedora 29
&gt;besttopnewcontroversialoldq&amp;a &amp;#x200B; Hey there, thanks for the mention! I'm the owner of spotify-downloader but I wouldn't call it a quality code project. I started it nearly 2.5 years ago and I've learned many new things about code-style since. There have been a few refactors but I am certain there are still ways to achieve lower coupling and more modularity. I don't know how the other 2 projects are quality-wise but I've heard good things about [django's codebase](https://github.com/django/django).

I would assume that, given the school requires you to do this test, the classroom laptops are equipped with all you need to take the test? I mean, if you want to prepare or continue to work on your code at home, the only thing you would/should need to 'move' between classroom laptop and home pc is the code... 
Why notepad++?
It's really fun! The devices we code on are rpi-esque as far as specs go, there's some C/C++ interop, but most of it is signals and radio communication processing. The whole stack runs on Python in a ~100mb RAM footprint. Python makes it really easy to run on "anything" including our dev machines and build servers.
You've been told by the bot before to asks these kinds of questions in /r/learnpython 
More info required Is it a browser game? If not you probably need to take a screenshot and use optical character recognition to read the words. You are using pyautogui? if a browser game you can interface with the browser via means such as selenium.
Yes, we are given computers that have the Wing IDE. The main problem is the program I'm writing uses imports, which Wing doesn't seem to support. I tried asking my teacher why this was and he said he didn't know, and I doubt he looked into it. My workaround was just to bring my IDE with the modules I used (Pygame, Numpy) to the classroom. The second problem which stems from using my USB is that my python interpreter breaks whenever I'm not using my home laptop, meaning I can't run my code, and the laptops at school won't run mine because the imports my code depends on are just registered as Errors when I run it on those laptops
How do you handle running on dev machines and build servers that don't have radios peripherals that your embedded devices have?
I remember trying this on Thursday, but pycharm had greyed out the option to change the path when I was on the school laptops. I'll try it again though 
Thank you /u/K900_ for answering me, and letting me know in a courtesy way unlike this jackass.
Thank you for pointing this out. I don't know why I didn't start there. :/ I'll check it out now.
Man, any kind of eyesight loss conditions/diseases scare me a lot. No cure, not preventable in most cases either. I do wonder how many legally blind programmers there are and how do they work around it?
Python 3.7.2+, C++17, Cython(trunk) Editor: Nuclide (atom) and vim Frameworks: Asyncio, thrift-py3 
A few ways, 1) We use a hardware abstraction layer (HAL) to map sysclass files with mocked input/output. 2) The pieces of the stack are modular and can communicate over sockets. So, you can run part of the program in a docker container that connects to other services that run on real hardware. 3) There are USB versions of similar hardware (like z-wave) that can be mapped to emulators/simulators. For example, a z-wave USB key can be reprogrammed to simulate any number of smart home devices for testing/debugging.
Usually I'm all for open sourcing my code, but my plan is so hopefully one day make it a game I can sell. I'm not an expert in legalese so I just made it a private repo. Would be happy to chat about it with you though
cause I got it setup for .rpy files which is an extension used by renpy to recognize script files, and I have a laguage highlighting module for renpy syntax. Couldn't find such syntax highlighting on sublime, so I stick with N++. Plus I already have all my snippets and layout how I like it to be. For pure python projects, I use sublime though
I pretty much use a combo of the book mentioned, ITPro.tv online classes and youtube tutorials - here is a good one - https://youtu.be/rfscVS0vtbw (4 + hours worth, great on the fly examples of simple programs). I'm not a software engineer by any stretch, but I've got the basics down that I can make useful programs at my job in ITSec

Ah, I see. Heh heh, kinda reminds me of this [comic](https://xkcd.com/1782/)
HTML/CSS/Javascript.
Relevant but not too much. I use sublime for everything else. But like any good developer, I have more than one tool in my toolbox. Just on my PC alone, I have half a dozen different text editors (atom, ST3, Notepad++, Editra, Vim) and that is not even counting all the IDEs (Android Studio, Codeblocks, IntelliJ, Visual Studio - not VSCode, Arduino IDE and I probably forgot some). I just use Notepad++ for my job cause it's setup correctly, and Sublime Text settings are a bit of a pain to set properly.
vim, bash, xmonad or i3 ... git, Docker Compose, Kubernetes, some CI/CD stack, PyCharm/IDEA now and then

VFX community is big. I don't think you're an edge case.
It's not harsh. I found your comment extremely useful, and I'll be changing the way I do certain things because of it.
It is still true today because doing any real programming in WSL is a joke. It is fine for writing python script if your job is DevOps but WSL is a turtle compared to a Linux OS. It is incredible slow and using python in windows vs linux is no comparison. WSL is great for small things and small "programming" projects but give me a Linux distro any day. 
I work on python for embedded Linux systems Business: • IDE: PyCharm/VS Code (with python plugin) • Bitbucket + git • Planning: JIRA • Team Comm: Slack • Documentation: Self hosted wiki • CI: Bamboo • Deployable: Debian packages / apt server / Yocto rootfs Python: • version 2.7 • dependency mgmt: yocto / self hosted apt server
Dev on Mac deploy to Linux. I used to use Linux locally but to be totally honest it can be a pain in the ass if you don't have a specific reason to.
How do you manage 3.8-dev in prod? What's your python upgrade cycle like? 
It's just a joke :( I'm a fraud! 
WAUT? That doesn't exist in IEEE?!!
When it comes to actually running Python, I wouldn't do it through WSL. I would just use Powershell or run code through PyCharm. Can't say I've ever noticed any speed problems.
Just to state, schools tend to use outdated software... like ours made us code in 2.7, use idle, etc. On the mac you can install whatever without root easily, on windows, an escalation bug to get admin then install. However, those methods were the preferred as our school. And most schools, do not allow you to plug anything into the computers, especially a life USB. Violates the school terms of service thing they make you sign on day 1. It counts as tampering. Have you thought to partition the USB and store code into the storage partition? Linux is very good with that, treats it like a USB within a USB.
Find a small problem and try to solve it without using too many resources. Your solution doesn't have to be perfect (it never will), but you will get better the more problems you solve on your own. As you progress, you can move on to reading up on special features that may help you solve a particular stubborn problem. Natural progression and learning by doing will be your best ally. Don't push yourself too hard - it's supposed to be fun.
The amount of activity from Serhiy in tracker and GitHub is hard to state. Serhiy and Victor created almost 1k PRs each driving 20-25% all commits. Serhiy always provided invaluable feedback and perspective over issues and a definite inspiration for many of us in commitment and quality of contributions. They will surely be missed and I wish I had more time to work with them with a lot of gratitude towards the guidance Serhiy gave on my initial work. With all said health is always important and I wish them best. I am sure there are many people across different communities whose work and enthusiasm is very high setting a higher bar but go underappreciated.
&gt; test data: factoryboy Have you ever considered using [Hypothesis](https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/)? I switched over a few years ago and would never go back, or for that matter try to test anything without a similar tool. Major highlights: - Never, ever flaky. Once it triggers a bug once, the cache means that bug will be triggered every time until you fix it. - Reports minimal examples. The implementation must be black magic because it's entirely automatic, but debugging is so much easier. - Simple core API and tons of optional helpers, plus frequent (semver) updates.

I'm pretty new to Python myself, but I would probably just store each day and its info in a nested list. You don't need a function for this. I have no idea what your error is about, just wanted to offer an alternative. BTW, these types of questions are really best suited for r/learnpython.

Saving while booting from the drive should be possible. While it sadly not an option anymore in the ubuntu startup disk creater, you can still get persistent storage if you use something like [Universal USB Installer](https://www.pendrivelinux.com/universal-usb-installer-easy-as-1-2-3/) .
I agree with the other poster. But try people.items()
General Domain: Data ETL Editor: Vim/Sublime Text/PyCharm* Source Control: git/Bitbucket Planning: JIRA Team Communication: Slack CI/CD: Jenkins Deployable Unit: Docker Production Environment: Amazon/ECS/ECR/EKS Production Data Pipeline: Kafka/Spark/Hadoop/ElasticSearch Production Database: RDS/Postgres Production Monitoring: Grafana/Sentry/Prometheus Production Management: Kubernetes/Helm Project Management: Agile Python Specific version: python 3.7.x dependency mgmt: venv db interaction: sqlalchemy/psycopg http request routing: falcon exploring: ipython serialization: json/message pack/ app server: gunicorn test data: we have to use a database; too much data here test runner: py.test * I use pycharm these days primarily for these reasons: 1. my team members use it and it's helpful for debugging their machines when something goes wrong 2. pycharm's vim integration is fantastic 3. I really don't have to futz with the settings or plugins like I would with sublime text, vim and spacemacs. A few other notes... 1. This is my current job and I've been developing software professionally for about 23 years of which about 20 years are using python. Things have definitely evolved over those 20 years. 2. I have developed software for: embedded systems, military aircraft, automobile infotainment, locomotives, big data, game/entertainment, etl pipelines, backend, infrastructure, network monitoring, etc. The tools (especially the Python list) above all change based on domain, so I'm not sure that one set of tools is universal. 3. At my current employment, we're primarily concerned with continuously running data pipelines and serving the results of those data pipelines through a REST interface. All that aside, our current architecture feels like this is not a great architecture overall and it should be replaced with something different. The mashup between REST and ETL simply doesn't work well with multiple REST services that are ultimately closely related but different, forcing our front-end services to query multiple backend services for data.
Pycharm, gitlab, jira, confluence, Jenkins, foreman, Koji.
This is my setup too
so how are you automating the device?
So far I have used Ubuntu startup disk cleaner, Rufus, Unetbootin, and Oracle VM virtual box. Hoenstly, I'm pretty hesitant to go down that rabbit hole again because of how much time it took, and if I install pycharm/python on my USB again after erasing partions if it will make a difference Maybe me not erasing partitions in between trying different methods could've been the issue. What makes Universal USB manager different?
I tried using items() before but it didn't work. Turns out it was because I was referencing the list item directly instead of the value stored in the loop. I got it working. Thanks!
noted, my bad!
So to be clear you were right
Same. Although with docker I’m becoming less reliant on macOS. 
I have not. It looks interesting but not sure how it would fit the use case that I'm using factory boy for. Primarily rows in the database for a given test. 
Can you format your USB in class then on your home system you have privileges/access to accommodate for the USB rather than the other way around? 
What do you mean by "Format" the USB in class?
What do you use for coding? PyCharm does this
I use the official python thing? Idk if it is. Thanks I'll look up pycharm
My work is something like 98% Python and 2% JS. For editing I use `neovim` (might switch to `spacemacs` or `kakoune` for [Matt Might's programmer resolutions](http://matt.might.net/articles/programmers-resolutions/) next month). My editor configuration is fairly simple. I can count the number of plugins I use on both hands: https://github.com/EFulmer/dotfiles/blob/master/init.vim I work heavily out of the shell, so I use `tmux` extensively. I am not extensively familiar with `tmux`'s power features but with a fairly minimal knowledge I can get a lot done. My work Python stack is pretty conventional. We're on 3.6.7 (last time we checked 3.7 we could not use it - iirc due to `async` getting true keyword status, which broke some dependency that had `async` as a variable name) `flask` for web services that don't have a UI and are just a collection of endpoints. `django` for web applications that require forms. Also the standard data science toolkit of `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`, and so on. For testing, we use `pytest`, `factoryboy`, and `behave`, though it doesn't work well for us, so we're moving everything to `pytest`. Everything is run in a Docker container, pretty common nowadays. Our deployment is done through `ansible` which is very nice IME. I want to set up a playbook to install and configure my setup on new machines, but I don't work directly out of remote servers very often. For infrastructure, we use GCP. Everything we do is fairly conventional; VM running our Docker images, and a PostgreSQL server also managed by GCP. 
Do you guys write documentation in jupyter notebooks? If so were you able to integrate it with confluence?
I use Docker for Windows + WSL and haven't had any issues. It also makes it simpler for pycharm use. What part of your workflow requires a VM over that?

oh no, totally understandable, I dont know a lot of code anyways, but Im interested in how is your project, how does it look like and how doez it behave like the thing OP showed us, I liked OP post so if your project is similar, then it would be quite interesting to me.
Microservices development and python services for Angular 7. I develop on Windows 10 using Visual Studio Code then generate a Docker container to deploy. You can have Linux Docker container in Windows. In the rare case I need Linux i run an Ubuntu image in Hyper-V in Windows 10 and pull the Image from the Microsoft Hyper-V library so it takes very little time to install.

WSL is great for checking compatibility in scripts that run cross platform but that’s about it. If you’re writing a Linux program then you should be using a Linux distro for debugging but it’s easy to use WSL in order to just check for cross comp errors 
We've only recently started using Jupyter, I didn't know there was a confluence integration! That's awesome.
There are lots of them, and they just use screen readers. Sites and programs with bad accessibility are always a problem, but hopefully less so every day. 
I use the queues in a multiprocessing manager, but I think those only work with similar processes.
Just want to say that, as a budding programmer/developer like myself, it’s really interesting reading this conversation between you two. 
Would you mind explaining the differences and reasons for using both docker and kubernetes?
This is actually a rather new job for me, so I do not know for certain. I am also super new to Kubernetes. It seems that docker and docker-compose is a lot more developer friendly and easy to use locally, but Kubernetes is a lot better in a production environment and lot easier to monitor and scale. 
They're idiots who don't know what real pros use.

Now that I write code for myself I get to choose the toolset. * Fedora 29 with KDE Plasma current version (5.13 I think) * VS Code * Konsole * Ansible * Python 3.6+ * Virtualenv * Docker on occasion * Flask * Database migrations decoupled from the application code. Your persistence data structures shouldn't have a hard coupling with your software structures. The Rails/Django paradigm of class == DB table is a disaster. * Whatever database is best for the job. Dynamo, MySQL, postgres, redshift, I don't care much anymore after doing data work for 15 years. They're all fine, pick the ones best suited for your use case. I do prefer MySQL over postgres for vanilla rdbms (i.e. outside of use cases like GIS, where pg is better) because replication is better and the internal DB management tools are infinitely better (e.g. "show processlist" instead of the arcane incantations you have to do in PG for everything) * Kafka is cool though way overused, like all shiny objects in this industry * Message queues are a handy paradigm. Rabbit, active, zero MQ, doesn't matter much. Pick the one you know. * Redis I'm of two minds about. I like what it can do, with TTLs and complex structures in memory. But the flush to disk method is poor, and the API is evil and unintuitive. Tooling around redis also sucks. And HA redis is a pain. * vim for quick edit jobs, especially files outside of home you have to edit as root. I have vscode running as me and sudoing a new instance for config files feels heavy.
Universal USB just makes it easy to set up persistent storage on your bootable USB. If you want a portable system on a stick that is my go to. If you’re just trying to write your program in both places and have it run easily have you though of just using git? You would still need PyCharm on both computers but at least your program would be easily run on either system.
Hrm... What happens when you invoke the interpreter from the terminal (vs pycharm)? I.e., does the interpreter start when you run `python` at the command line? Need more info to help
My own use case: I often need to edit upstream pypi libraries and make pull requests. I mount my entire virtualenv and any git checkout pypi paths in the docker pythonpath. pip install -e (editable) etc. I also have a slow PC so helps to not have to rebuild my docker image if I edit my reqs.txt. I do the same with npm node_modules folder. Always a mount folder and not a dockerfile instruction. 
General: * Languages: C++, Python, Bash * VCS: Git - Host: GitHub * OS: Ubuntu 18.04 (w/ Gnome Extensions) * Build: Bazel * Packaging: Starlark (Bazel) for emitting CMake "install"-like artifacts * Editor: Sublime Text 3 - paid, of course :) If debugging C++ / CPython extensions gets too hairy: * gdbserver + gdb * gdbserver + CLion if I just want a GUI * Dependency Packaging: Docker + pip for generating deterministic archives for Bazel to consume + cache * Planning: ZenHub, Asana, Google Docs * Communication: Slack * CI/CD: Jenkins, a smattering of TravisCI + CircleCI * Test Data: Kitware's Girder - for UAC + Hashsum plugin to get deterministic large data stuff that works well enough with Bazel (could mebbe work better, but I hacked this interface a while back...) Python (2+3): * Numerics: NumPy, PyTorch, Pandas * Exploration: Jupyter Notebook (starting to take a peek at Jupyter Lab) - Integration with Bazel (and being able to run notebooks as unittests) - Widgets. Widgets all the way. * Hacking Deps: `virtualenv` + `pip` * Hacking C Extensions: [Custom-built CPython w/ dbg+valgrind](https://gist.github.com/EricCousineau-TRI/ce79d3265bb72934267e24ddc8c623bc) * C++ Bindings: pybind11 (with some public mods) * Testing: `unittest` * HTTP Stuff: `requests`
Oh lol, I was actually asking if you all had intergrated it. I haven’t been able to find documentation on how to do it, which is surprising. Sorry for the confusion!
- Editor: Emacs with elpy and some other plugins - SCM: git, plus a locally hosted gitlab server - Team communications: I don't have a team. If I need to tell myself something, I scribble it on a post-it and put it on the bottom of my coffee mug. - Deployment: Web apps are deployed to Debian on VMware using fabric or bash scripts. For desktop apps I use cx_Freeze to package and the desktop support staff for deployment. - For bug tracking, I use our internal ticket system that I maintain. 
One of https://github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-py or https://github.com/DataDog/datadogpy or https://github.com/prometheus/client_python depending on whether I'm in a position to pull or push metrics. 
I use vim in large part because it was beaten into me by the senior dev in my first professional job. I tell my juniors to do whatever makes them happy. It's a better way. 
Why Trello? Why not something like kanboard with swim lanes? Also how big is your team
Couple of notes here. 1. There's a python library called "stem" that integrates with TOR and works super well 2. There's a config option within TOR called "FascistFirewall" that'll force your traffic over :443. Give that a shot If that doesn't work, try out a pluggable transport. I'm quite partial to the one that uses domain fronting, because domain fronting is bad ass. I think it's called mute or something like that. A final note, please try to stay out of trouble.
Do you have virtualbox at both locations? I have an external USB drive with a vmdk file that has my development os, Ubuntu, and I just carry that around. Moves between my laptop and desktop.
I write web software &amp; maintain a few Free projects like [Aletheia](https://github.com/danielquinn/aletheia) and [Paperless](https://github.com/danielquinn/paperless): * Arch Linux * GNOME * gnome-terminal * PyCharm * Docker (both for testing different environments and deployment) * Firefox * Django * PyTest (for isolated modules, Django test runner for Django) * pytest-sugar * pytest-xdist * pytest-cov * pycodestyle * iPython * GitLab (handles all of the following): * Source code * Tasks/boards * CI * AWS * EC2 * S3 * RDS * gunicorn * supervisor * Heroku * Circle CI I have a few clients &amp; projects, so there's some overlap here as some systems were in place before I arrived. Generally though, I'm a huge fan of GitLab and prefer AWS to Heroku.
For main work, PyCharm. Experiments, Jupyter. (Found that Visual Studio is broken in regards to re-loading external DLLs of different versions.)
&gt;A bit off topic, but why is it still so (relatively) hard to append rows to an existing DataFrame? Why not use pd.concat()?
Most respondents said they use pytest. I found it is slow from few tests I run with GCP Python examples. What do you like using it? There are only few use nose too.
I started Learn Python the Hard Way about a week and a half ago and made a few scripts at work to automate some monotonous uploads. My goal for this week is to finish a script that will add files in a folder to a second folder if they are not already present in the second folder. I have it working for the most part but I need it to run 35 times to different folders and it errors after 3. I'm only about 25% of the way through LPTHW so I'm punching above my weight class already. Back to the books.
Yes!!!
Is there anything special treatment required, or is it as straight forward as developing and deploying on Linux?
Doing the lord's work.
Also I can snapshot VMs and bring them back when I inevitably destroy them.
look into tor bridges.
I did this for a year at a startup. Started with just me and my friend, Python 2.7, git/Github, pip, emacs. Eventually switched to Python 3.5, started using venv, and switched to PyCharm for my IDE. Eventually settled on pytest for tests. Slack for team communication. We didn’t use CI.
I need some help on python, **1.

I agree. Recently had a contract where they made me use Windows so I thought, ah, WSL will be great, I can do Linux on Windows. Holy fuck it's slow, using Git.
::-1 is a view not a copy. 
NEVER use the IDLE. I also suggest using PyCharm as it will try and force you to do things correctly.
If user_Input == "Addition": Result = num1 +num2 Elif user_Input == "Subtraction": Result = num1 - num2 Etc... Print(result) 
Sounds like a question for the learn programming subreddit. But to answer your question you can use IF statements. You should probably go through a beginner programming tutorial like CodeAcademy that teaches the basics of programming because this question is the very basics. Do that and then start do your project.
WSL is only really slow when accessing many files. Processing heavy code will run just as fast. And the permissions issue isn't really any issue for most people developing on single-user personal computers.

What's it missing now?
There's a lot of people who are super passionately anti-windows.
Any surprises and gotchas with that method. I prefer Linux all the way.
Linux/Emacs. I use Windows rarely and not for dev.
Very nice!! How did you do the animation? What ide/tools did you use? 
No that's great. I've got some health downtime right now and am enjoying break from work. Looking to use the time to automate as much as the job description scope creep as possible for when I get back so I'm not back in the deep end. Appreciate the input. 
Yes, that's true. Here's the thing about anti-Windows people: you can have your software preferences, but isn't it cool to see what the "other side" thinks?
Working on not giving up on making my game since I know every project I start I never end. And being closer and closer to 30 with no actual portfolio leaves me nowhere in a competitive side of programming. 
Social media website. Frontend is in REACT, but Flask/Python backend/API.
I strongly suggest you check out pyenv to replace virtualenv, and poetry for pipenv.
Save the program as a .py file and run it from terminal. Curses needs a proper terminal to work and most likely IDLE doesn't emulate one. 
As in proper terminal, would the “new file” tab that opens a notepad/text-file page where you can input code, and then when you run it, it runs in the first window the IDLE? 
Oh, for example Emoji display. They're working on it though: https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/commandline/2018/11/15/windows-command-line-unicode-and-utf-8-output-text-buffer/ Yes, it sounds trivial, but it's used in some progress bars (which are using Braille characters), some status characters etc. Some terminal emulators are also able to display full images beside the text, but that's abusing the terminal emulator, really.
We use it extensively in automation and monitoring. Works really well with AWS.
Windows+ Anaconda + Odoo. Some workarounds but working okish.
I've get paid for coding in Python about two years yet. I'm a big fun of CLI. Here is what I'm using: * I don't like `pyenv`, there is no need to "manage Python version", just use any shipped with your distro (but ensure it is Python 3) (if you want more fresh one, switch to rolling distro, I'll recommend Solus). * I prefer to use `poetry` to manage dependencies, but still use `pipenv` in some old ones). If I need to do something directly with project's virtualenv, I use `vex`. * Git for VCS. * Editor: Sublime Text, Neovim at times. * Code formatter: `black`. * Testing framework: `pytest`. * Linter: `pyflakes` (tried `pylint` but it is over-complicated and produces false positives (and hard to set up not to do)). * Metrics: `radon`, `coverage`. * I've used gitlab builtin CI, Circle CI, Travis CI. Basically using anything is available. * Docker and `docker-compose` for deployment and "local-staging".
 \&gt; Take one snapshot, use all data as cached. &amp;#x200B; So... it's a snapshot of what all the [coinmarketcap.com](https://coinmarketcap.com) API offers at a current time?
No, It parses all historical daily data with beaufulsoup from their website and writes csv files(like excel file). Uses that afterwards. Maybe I should’ve been written it specifically.
This is a nice simple write-up, spoiled by the huge "join me on Facebook" button. On mobile, it covers a significant portion of the screen.
Well, I still upvoted you because I saw "coinmarketcap".
Lol, thank you.
Save your source code using File-&gt;Save As from the IDLE menu. Name it e.g. `snake.py`. Then open a [terminal](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/usage/terminal/). Navigate to the directory you saved the source code using the `cd` command. Then you can run your program by invoking python: `python snake.py`. Maybe you should ask further questions at /r/learnpython.

If by 'run manually in the console' you mean 'run as a script' then you can divide above estimate by two (at least)
You certainly *could* use Hypothesis for that, but it wouldn't add much unless the specific contents could affect the result of the test. If you're using `@pytest.mark.parametrize`, those tests might be a better place to try Hypothesis - let me know if you have any luck!
Thanks! I've always had this question, but haven't found a simple explanation.
I think your issue is not 'imports do not work in Wing IDE' but rather that the libraries you want to import (PyGame, Numpy, ...) are not installed on the classroom laptop. So the question you have to ask your teacher is if it is OK for you to use libraries/packages which are not part of Python's standard library. And if that is OK, then also ask how to go about installing those extra packages/libraries on the classroom laptop(s)... by 'how to go about' I mean agreeing "who can and will install them and by when"
i am intrested in knowing what it is called right now &amp;#x200B;
My python coding is limited to single .py files. Packages have always been a black box to me. This just highlights how much I need to learn. Thank you. 
Having a ~/.pythonrc in the root of a system on a new machine without any dependency guarantees is a pretty good excuse.
Never underestimate tribalism. There are a lot of Linux users on online communities that have the opinion of "Linux is better than Windows in every way". They don't really care what the other side thinks, in fact many of them go to Windows-specific communities just to proselytise about Linux.
`while 1`s should be `while True`s, first of all
The one with the "no thanks" that immediately removes it, you mean?
First of all, neither is more pythonic. Second of all, ’one’ rhymes with `1`.
Yeah, I agree with you. It's funny how some don't realize that each OS has their advantages and disadvantages. Proper tool for proper task, that's what I think.
Thanks!
I spent some time last year to make it as easy as possible for me to setup new python projects from scratch. https://gitlab.com/mbarkhau/bootstrapit It's an opinionated approach to packaging, dependencies, testing, ci, linting, formatting, type checking and versioning, all of it accessible through a simple invocation of `make help`. Yes I know about the cookiecutter project.
Hi guys. If you are anything like me, you download a lot of distributions. Keeping them up to date is always a chore, so I decided to create my first python project. I wanted to get some eyes on this project as it is my first. To see if there are major mistakes that I made or things that should be changed. Maybe the project is even going to be helpful to somebody other than me.
Port 9150 is the tor version made for the Tor browser. If you want port 9050 you have to start tor by itself and not in a browser. On linux you would do: "sudo service tor start". But if you do not mind having the browser open you can use port 9150. To get bridges for the tor browser you can use this guide: [https://www.torproject.org/docs/bridges.html](https://www.torproject.org/docs/bridges.html) That guide also contains information on how to get bridges for standalone Tor. Thank You So much, i'll try it considering your notes and i'll stay out of trouble. &amp;#x200B;
I'm having my xkcd.com/353/ moment right now.

You could put the webserver into the asyncio process, attached to the same event loop as your core functionality. You could use aiohttp for this. (there might be reasons you chose flask that I can't see from the text above.) Another approach would be to run a separate thread in your core app, running the flask stuff. Use queues to pass messages between threads. (This is fiddly, and not a great model. It would work) If slapdash is fine, you could have the web server drop files in a directory, each with a unique name. Each file is a command. The core app could periodically look for files in that directory. (This is a hacky IPC where you use the filesystem to host a queue. It is easy to get started, but in the long run often more trouble than doing something elegant.) If I were doing it, I might do this. Work out how to launch a socket server in your asyncio core app. Host a server on localhost:9000. When the flask app comes up, have it make a long-running client connection to this. Each time you get an event from the webserver, pass it over that socket connection. You would need to come up with some simple protocol for this communication. It could be textual. (e.g. json) Sounds like an interesting project. Feel free to ping me out-of-band. 
I wrote my first module, [wraphper](https://pypi.org/project/wraphper/), and I wanted it to be easily usable by writing `import wraphper as php`, but that didn't work and I have to be more verbose, like `from wraphper import wraphper as php`. What am I doing wrong? 
I'm just switching over from PHP to Python, so I wrote a package that will help ease the transition. It's called wraphper and it aims to give you Python function aliases with PHP function names. https://pypi.org/project/wraphper/
Woah! big fan! hello!
Wrong stuff in there, e.g. this is simply not the case anymore: &gt;Python has to be instructed about which directory should become a package. To do this, simply add an empty file called `__init__.py` inside each desired folder. Every directory is a python 3 package if it has a compatible name (i.e. \`\\w+\`, unicode alphanumerics and underscores)
I prefer [`flit init`](https://flit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
`import wraphpher` gives you a module. `from wraphper import wraphper` gives you the class of the same name. There’s absolutely no need to create that class. Just delete the lines `class wraphper(object):` and `@classmethod`, dedent everything that comes after, and you have what you want. Classes are there if you want to create new instances that have to keep track of state. E.g. the following should be a class since it keeps track of the `count` instance variable: class Counter: def __init__(self, initial: int = 0): self.count = initial def increment(self): self.count += 1 counter = Counter(5) counter.increment() print(counter.count) Also: `class Blah(object):` is useless, simply do `class Blah:`.
thanks for the clarification
I refuse to work on machines without at least python 3.5
Trust me, the next time pipenv fucks up on my machine, I'm moving to something else. Stuff seems to break for no reason at all in things i'm doing and bug reporting is a nightmare. 
I'm a professional that mostly deals with node, dotnet core and devops/sre stuff on those stacks but we've got some python apps that I've helped build over the years. - Versions: 2.7 on the big boys, 3.6 on the supporting apps. - OS: Linux but running in docker containers - Editor: for python and node I use neovim + deoplete + ale. For others it's usually a jetbrains ide with ideavim. - Frameworks: Django, flask, aiohttp, there's some pyramid some where Builds - bitbucket on prem - bamboo for build server - bamboo specs because the bamboo UI is the hottest of trash - docker for isolating builds - terraform for handling infrastructure the app needs - helm for managing k8s deploys, invoked by terraform - aws/eks as deployment target - moving to Hashicorp Consul and Vault for config and secret management, haven't really figured out reloading configs for python and node yet - opentracing/jeager for diagnostics - datadog for metrics - log to stdout and shipped to ELK via host process We're in the process of deciding what to do with the python 2.7 apps despite me banging the EOL gong for a year now. Sounds like it'll be migrated to node/typescript/nest which is fine with me because that's consolidating on stacks to instrument (not all of this is automagic some of it needs to be done manually).
I would recommend Flask of Falcon. Flask is easy to get started with and has baked in solutions to all the problems you listed. You could use Flask views for your requests, and that would make them easily routable. Errors would also be easier to track 
Just feels annoying to have to press that to get rid of it… after pressing “OK, got it” to get rid of the cookie banner.
Not anything problematic that I can think of really. There are small differences between the gnu tools a lot of people won’t notice, but you can install almost anything you could want with the package manager homebrew. That is how most people would recommend installing python, but it is probably best to avoid developing using the system python on any platform. By default macOS uses launchd instead of cron, but you can install cron if you want. I use pycharm a lot but also ssh, tmux, and vim in the default terminal app or iterm. In terms of surprises, if you didn’t already know there is a ton of great software for macOS. Not all of it is foss but if you like developers getting paid you might really enjoy that anyway. 
Team Size is \~10 &amp;#x200B; As far as Trello goes. I didnt choose to use it, it was a choice made before I started there I'm just glad it's not jira. It's funny, the last sprint retrospective we did, everyone on the team said they hated Trello. But there was no concrete/actionable reasons given. It all seemed to revolve around requirements being a painful process for one reason or another. So, I've concluded that the tool matters very little for this in solving the problem of getting good requirements. &amp;#x200B; The way we use trello is a variation on kanban(or at least how I understand it). &amp;#x200B; The lanes are * Up Next * Sprint Commitment * Development (The goal is to minimize the number of stories that are in progress) * Code Review * QA * Done Temporary Lanes are sometimes used when Production bugs are discovered. &amp;#x200B; It's nothing special. It works for the most part. The teams complaints are more about the contents of the stories than the tool being used. Any tool would work here.
Hey everyone! What are great open source projects to work on in Python that will be great to show when looking for employment as a Python Developer? Thank you!
Kubernetes orchestrates docker containers doesn't it?
Awesome! Thanks. I thought that having class-less functions would be frowned upon like in PHP!
Can you explain what you mean? I think of macOS as a preference, if not macOS a Linux distro would be the next best thing imho.
Yeah, you need to think of a df as a specialised datatype (because it is) which you only take out of the box once your data is ready to analyse.
Yeah, and I wonder what the performance will look like if they filtered with filter() and only put the relevant rows into pandas.
I'm working on a similar project at work just now. My approach has been to filter outside of pandas. Stick your input data through filter() and build the data line by line in standard library python.
No venv setup, no testing, no linting, no type checking, no CI setup, no versioning and depending on your package, python 2 compatibility can be an issue with flit. 
It depends. And more importantly, GOOD luck!
A github repo where I will put and illustrate some ideas I had: [https://github.com/Fledermann/code_salad](https://github.com/Fledermann/code_salad/blob/master/README.rst) I always liked python blog posts in this style, and figured a public repo would be better than private blogs. PRs welcome!
`if type(array) not in (list, dict)` should be `if not isinstance(array, (list, dict))` so that `array` can be an instance of a subclass of `list` or `dict`. There are also other types that are countable, e.g. `dict`. In fact, anything with a `__len__` method is countable. To really cover every single case, the easiest and probably fastest way is to just try it: try: return len(array) except TypeError as e: raise TypeError(f'{array} does not have a length') If you don't care about the exception message, you can even remove the `try ... except ...` and just `return len(array)`.
Not 100% sure but I'd guess the if construct iterates over your whole dictionary to check if word is a key of it. o(n) Try-except just looks if something is stored in a fixed key. o(1)
How does a `defaultdict(int)` compare for speed?
1. /r/learnpython 2. I'm actually getting some [pretty different results](https://repl.it/@k9001/ContentDarkgreyFeed). It also depends on your data, _a lot_. If you have lots of collisions, the try/except method will be faster; if you have few collisions, it will likely be slower. Also, `collections.Counter` beats both, consistently.
In the if Version, it checks whether the word is in counter or not, for every word. In the try except Version, it does not do that. That are the extra actions. Use a profiler to find out where your code is slow
It does not. Dictionaries override `__contains__` to be a hash lookup.
Next up you should illustrate how __init__.py can be used. FWIW https://github.com/requests/requests is my go-to for this kind of thing. Or really anything that https://github.com/kennethreitz works on. 
I have around 13 million words
What matters isn't how many words you have, it's how many of them are the same.
I'm sorry I wrote the question incorrectly. I edited it now.

I wouldn't even call it overriding. That's just how dicts work.
Your code matches what I wrote, and I'm still getting different results. 
There are a lot of collisions tho, as you said. Would that make a difference?
It is actually an override. Python will fall back to a full linear search on objects that don't implement `__contains__`, but do implement some variation of the iterator protocol. 
One of the first articles I’ve bothered to read and it was definitely worth it. Short and sweet, thanks!
Yes, it would. Also, you should really just use `collections.Counter`.
The slow part of the first implementation is the 'in' operation which has to iterate over the dictionary. In python, the average get or set operation on a dictionary is O(1) but iteration is O(n). See https://wiki.python.org/moin/TimeComplexity for details.
Seriously? And you can run Linux images on your Mac? How do you do it?
I guess because to check for existence, you've got to get the hash and then check the field that maps to in the dict. Your first approach does this twice, whereas your second does the lookup once and maybe only twice if the exception triggers 
That's not the case. Membership tests in a dictionary are just key lookups, and thus are O(1).
In EVERY iteration of the loop, the CPU has to branch to execute the right code based on the if/else evaluation.* With try/except, the cpu simply runs the try code without any checks and only reverts back if an exception occured. The handling of an exception might be expensive, but if it only happens, say hypothetically, 1% of the time So with if/else, you have to do a check every loop before deciding what to do. With try/except, the code only has to do extra work if an exception occured and if this is rare, the loop runs efficiently. * Usually this effect is improved by using branch prediction(your CPU should already do this for you).
Small price to pay for the effort they put in to things though right? Little give and take, could be worse. 
That's a great insight. Really helpful.
But is it really 60x more expensive? Doesn't if-else make use of branch prediction as well?
I would not talk about overriding in the context of a fallback behavior of the language itself. It's not as if that behavior is inherited from `object`.
I would expect branch prediction to figure out what to do if one conditional statement(if) occurs much more frequent than another(else) so I'm also surprised. Maybe someone else can shed a light on writing code that helps the branch predictor to find patterns more easily.
I'm pretty sure it actually is - `object.__contains__` is defined like that IIRC. 
easier to ask for forgiveness than permission 
Your test is bogus w/o statistics of your hit/miss ratio. I'll write here few things that are relevant to other responses, I just don't want to spread this all over the place: CPU... branch prediction... etc. "smart words" are irrelevant in this context. Both code examples are translated into hundreds if not thousands of CPU instructions, but not in the straight-forward way the posts here suggest. You could use the `DefaultDict` instead of the regular `dict`, and it would probably be more efficient.
Python is not part of MS Windows distribution as far as I can tell. I believe, it should be OK to delete it from that directory. But... it's Windows. So, you never know. Maybe, you have some bad program (not necessary malicious, just stupid) which decided to put Python interpreter in that directory. If that's the case, that program won't work.
why is that module faster? is it because it's running in compiled c?
poetry shell ...
To be exact, folders with valid module names without an `__init__.py` file are recognized as a `namespace` which behaves quite differently from packages (if the same namespace is found at multiple locations from your `sys.path` it will be merged). But I see what you mean: you'll be able to import modules from it.
Definitely a lot of repetitions in my case. 13 million total entries for 170k words
&gt;Kubernetes, from my understanding, actually uses docker containers. Thank you! Most of the discussions I saw were about one versus the other, I'll do some reading on the topic.
Thank you as well.
You can create a Ubuntu USB with persistent storage. I think some GUI Live-USB creators have a wizard for it, but really, all you need is: partition your USB disk. Install Ubuntu USB on the primary partition, and whatever you want to store: on another partition. Also, something simple wrt USB: Maybe PyCharm stores full path to your USB? And it just so happen that on your home computer you have volume labeled differently than on your school computer? I.e. `E:\something` vs `G:\something`?
I taught a lesson to sixth-grade science students about genetics using the micro:bit and a Python program that simulates virtual organisms and genetic trait passing over the built-in radio. [https://github.com/seantibor/uorganisms](https://github.com/seantibor/uorganisms)
This article isn't actually a good example of how to organize a general python package that you want to distribute to other people. Kenneth Reitz, the author of the popular requests package, has a good starting point template for a project -- [setup.py](https://github.com/kennethreitz/setup.py)
Why dont people use try-catch over if-else all the time ? (I am a beginner in programming) 
Can you elaborate?
That, and the fact that if has access to a dictionary's internals, meaning it can do some things faster that a normal dict lookup-add-write.
Like this? https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45950124/creating-image-tiles-mn-of-original-image-using-python-and-numpy
Because you don't always use `if/else` to handle errors. There are many other ways it can be used.

I was disappointed to find out that curses aren't really avaiable in windows for the use case that I need. So I set out to create my platform agnostic library for manipulating the console. I've barely started but so far the whole layout system is somewhat complete. It's also pretty performant to boot. GIF to show flying components in console. https://i.noku.pw/a/H99IeaqT5g.gif https://gist.github.com/nokusukun/c751b45955d7c06d38e3af28d8fd673e
`Counter` is a subclass of `dict`, so `__getitem__` and `__setitem__` have the same performance as `dict`. However, `Counter` defines the `__missing__` method, which tells a `dict` object what to do if `__getitem__` would throw a `KeyError`. This means that the if/else or try/except logic is handled by the `dict` source, rather than in a custom `__getitem__`. So while `Counter` is defined in pure Python, it does rely on some special methods and the source code of `dict` (which in CPython is all in C), which makes things faster than you are going to be able to in your pure Python code.
You’re right, having all that set up is pretty nice. I think the problem with those things is that their opinionated nature doesn’t fit better practices you have for yourself. E.g. I use flit, pyproject.toml and my own [get\_version](https://pypi.org/project/get_version/) for packaging. It’s honestly a much more elegant and less hacky setup compared to [setup.py](https://setup.py), diverse requirements.txt files and versioneer (or manual versioning). Starting new projects with legacy Python compatibility is honestly nothing but masochism in 2019.
The first example does each successful lookup twice, while the second does only one. I'd expect the second to be faster if most keys are present, although I wouldn't expect the magnitude of difference you see, so there maybe something else going on as well.
That shouldn't be as bad a problem as you think. If I remember correctly, `str` instances cache their hash once computed.
namespace packages are still packages and “quite differently” is an overstatement: I’ve never heard of accidental merging of namespace packages, it’s a feature that is invoked deliberately.
&gt;If you don't care about the exception message, you can even remove the try ... except ... and just return `len(array)`. And if you don’t care about the docstring, just do count = len &amp;#x200B;
That was my past career. Working for a company that does product design. They have a large 3d department that has pipeline needs. A much more friendly life work balance.
Because try/except or try/catch logic should really be used for errors, and sometimes unexpected behavior. In this example, the effectiveness of try/except is only present when you have words recurring a lot (I.e., it is unexpected/unlikely to run into a word you haven't already seen) so the additional cost of an except (exceptions cost a lot compared to if/else) is worth it. So, some other examples of places where it might make sense to use try/except over if/else are things like converting strings to ints or floats. If you can assume that the usual path is for a valid string to be passed, it will be faster to adopt an EAFP (easier to ask for forgiveness than permission) style, and clean up ("ask for forgiveness") if you had something which isn't a valid integer/float. **TL;DR**: if you have a "look before you leap" situation, you should probably use if/else. But if the bad case is unlikely, sometimes paying the penalty of exceptions is worth it.
For the case of integer values (especially for counting elements), I would say `Counter` is probably a better choice.
In python, it's more common to do : try: f = open(file) #... except FileNotFoundError: print("...") except PermissionError: print("...") than to do if file.exists(): if file.we_have_permission(): f = open(file) #... else: #... else: #... It's easier to try to do something, and if you can't, do the other (ask forgiveness) than check before (ask permission)
If your object define a `__iter__` or a `__getitem__`, it will searchover all sequence, even if there is no `__contains__`
Thanks. 
Linux way: open a UNIX socket (a pipe). This is a typical way deamons talk to the outside world. Typical place to put such a socket is under `/run/{daemon-name}.sock`. This is typically faster than TCP. Another, a tad more extreme way: use shared memory. Ask the system to allocate a bunch of pages for you, and use them to transfer arbitrary payloads between your daemon and web server. This is potentially faster than a socket, but at these speeds Python interpreter becomes the slowest / weakest link in this equation, so, maybe it will not be worth the effort.
The post you linked, basically, screams at you: "don't install `pipenv`!" But you want it anyways... why? Beside problems with `pip`, `pipenv` will generate a lot more of them... it is anything but production ready. Play with it at home if you like, but don't use it for real projects--you'll end up doing more infrastructure work than you would have been doing without it. pip install -r requirements.txt Is all sorts of bad, but it is not as bad as `pipenv sync`. If you can manage to write a `setup.py` that can install your project: that would be even better. It's still bad, but better than `pip install`. Finally, the best you can do is, if you are lucky and all dependencies you need for your project are already in your Linux distro's repositories, then write a system package, which you can install using system's package manager (i.e. DEB, RPM, and so on). Barring that, and if you can confirm that simply copying the necessary packages into `site-packages` would work, this would be also better than `pip install` and friends: it is a very low effort for something that will "just work", and will be very simple to troubleshoot in the future.

Wow this is a really good article. Thanks for sharing!
I have just publish this small tool on Github. Hope you like it! I still have a few more things on my todo list like verifying Windows support, more options, and better test coverage. But it's already useful to me as it is now ;).
Yep! I forgot the blog (I will try to find it) but certain WSL IO functions are as slow as 70% compared to a dedicated linux os. For the haters down voting: I am not saying WSL sucks or is unusable. I am simply stating that if you do any real programming (not scripts or small tool creation) WSL is not the right tool.
Python files are downloadable. A program I wrote has an update checker and pop up a QT link to the download page. I did it using urllib2 and just parsing a webpage for ‘xxx 1,2 has been released’. Hackish, but it works. I’d be wary of replacing files with code. You’re likely to break something because you expected the user to upgrade from 1.1 to 1.2 and not 1.0 to 1.2. Maybe you don’t have permissions. Maybe only one file was updated, but not the others. Maybe you have a bug in the latest version or it works a little differently and they don’t want to use that.

I just double checked and, at least in my browser, there is no "no thanks". It shows up as a white square with the thumbs up icon and the text "join me on facebook" above it. That is all, no button to get rid of it. Sounds like it may be an artifact of browser "standards". I'll take a look with a couple different browsers and see if this happens anywhere else.
What projects have you done? It’s kinda hard to get better if you don’t challenge yourself and work on a project that takes you at least a month. Even that is tiny in the grand scheme. I’ve been at python for 13 years and keep thinking I’ve plateaued. Then I look at my old code from even just 2 years ago. Is it logically organized? Is it fast? Is it tested? How many hacks did I put in? How many features did I not get in due to lack of time?
I just recently came across [Learn Python the Hard Way](https://learnpythonthehardway.org) after spending a few months using Codecademy Pro for Python 3/Computer Science path. I have to admit that Learn Python the Hard Way has been more beneficial due to the style of teaching. It's really just you, Terminal (if you're on Mac), and the Atom Text Editor. Each exercise comes with an overview and then study drills to take deeper dives on the objective. In addition, there's a section of commonly asked questions. All in all, this approach has worked best for me. I also have a similar background with learning the basics of HTML and CSS. As such, using [Free Code Camp](https://learn.freecodecamp.org) has been great too.

Generally you will have multiple sockets for multiple clients. To do that you would need to use threading. In short, you would want a list that holds threads that hold connections, a list of connections, and thread that listens for new connections. The thread responsible for listening to new connections just takes the new connection and spins up a new thread that handles communication for the new connection. You would need to add this thread to the thread list and then add the connection to the connection list. Then that listening thread just begins listening for new connections again. The newly spun up thread just sits in loop that waits for data to be sent by its connection. When it receives data it can call some sort of function that can echo it back to all the connections in the connections list. Hope that makes sense. I believe there are some good client/server tuts on here that go over the starting points for these types of things. 
Thats exactly what my script is doing right now, its just that every connection after the first somehow fails
Ok, thanks, basically what I want to do is make a website using google sites or something. Could you explain how to put my python file onto my website? And also how you made the update checker. But how exactly do you send updates out? &amp;#x200B;
I'll take the down votes... WSL sucks to the point of rendering it unusable
I just double checked and, at least in my browser, there is no "no thanks". It shows up as a white square with the thumbs up icon and the text "join me on facebook" above it. That is all, no button to get rid of it. Sounds like it may be an artifact of browser "standards". I just checked and it seems to only happen with the built in browser of the "Relay" Reddit app. When looking with other browsers, the "nope, thanks anyway" is quite small and I wouldn't trust it due to it's size, location, and the VERY annoying delayed poop (auto correct changed popup to poop which is the same thing so I am leaving it) so the end result is the same. In all honesty, I dealt with the pop-up so I could give feedback. If I were actually trying to find an answer to a question and stumbled on your webpage, I would have nopped out as soon as that popped up. You already have a static link to your Facebook and Twitter accounts, this is just an annoying addition. The quality of the content doesn't matter if you drive viewers away before the have read it. There are too many other choices to put up with pop-ups. Just my two cents, do what you think is best. Best of luck with your blog.
It's really hard for me to read the code because reddit isnt formatting anything for me, but from what I can tell you have your while loop which has "s". So "s" is your socket I assume and you call accept once and then close. Have you tried adding in the bind and listen calls right before the accept call instead of only calling them once? 
Is it only for fun (or for improving your skills)? I can't see a list of killer features. &gt; auto completion and the ability to run scripts in interactive mode I'm able to do this with any text editor and Python REPL in terminal like [bpython](http://bpython-interpreter.org/). If you really want to make some tool that lots of people would use, look on [Juno](http://junolab.org/). It's a set of plugins for Atom to transform it into IDE for Julia. You can make something similar for Python. As for me, I would really like to have a watch on variables and a possibility to run blocks of code separately (like in Jupyter). 
So if python modules and packages are just putting things in folders (as it should be), what's all this setuptools, distutils, eggs, yada yada stuff where people make it sound like creating a Python library is almost impossibly complex? 
Or we can give constructive feedback so he knows what is annoying to readers, so it can be improved and everybody wins. Another option is to just leave the page as soon as a pop-up appears, which is what I usually do.
First of all, let me thank you for your help. I dont know how and why but i've just rewritten the script and now it is working as intended Heres the soloution for all that have the same problem as me: [pastebin](https://pastebin.com/puVmcs1k)
its starting to look really good. I am amateur but i am still following this. hopefully once i learn more i can help you. Cheers and thanks again
Now try deleting the s.close
No prob! Happy to see you got it working!
No i don't have virutal box in both locations, just on the USB I feel like my Teacher would question me installinf a virutal machine on the school's laptops
Did you see the video demo in read me? I thought that looked awesome. But I agree with you, OP should focus on bringing out the features in the readme a bit better
A few videos I watched had me partition the USB through the use of Terminal or Gparted, but I don't think either method works. Maybe it was the version of Ubuntu I was using?
Look into the `zip` function. Also, /r/learnpython.

Hey! This is a project I made for fun yeah. The features are all shown in the video demo but I should probably write them down in the README.
I would write your program like this: &amp;#x200B; def giveMoviesHigherThan(givenScore): return \[movie for movie, score, hasOscar in zip(movies, scores, oscars) if score &gt; givenScore and hasOscar\]
What do you even need to "build" in your Python app?
Running tests is the biggest thing, but eventually we would like to build our Docker images in the same CI job, rather than manually kicking off the image build process when we make changes. Right now building the images in the CI job would be prohibitively slow.
So how is any of it related to Python? It sounds like you just want Docker integration.
there is no object.\_\_contains\_\_, try it
Keep going at it! You can also write other little projects which either have smaller end goals or are easy to 'complete' and then are easy to constantly improve. Finally, work on what you enjoy more than anything else (and it looks like you're doing just that!). Being competitive means next to nothing if you're competitive in a field you don't enjoy. If you're working on a game, then you've almost certainly completed a ton of little projects which build towards the greater game as a whole. Inventory systems, texture, map design, comparators for win and loss conditions, or whatever builds up your game. There's a lot you've completed in your portfolio. It's just not yet wrapped up under the label of, "A game"
No, I want an incremental build system for our application which is written in Python among other languages. Docker images are the artifact format, and I mentioned that for additional context in case it was helpful.
But what are your actual build steps? Why do you need Python integration? What sort of stuff are you doing to your Python code during the build that requires your build system to understand Python?

&gt; Starting new projects with legacy Python compatibility is honestly nothing but masochism in 2019. For a pure python project, it's honestly not that bad. I recently did a [backport of pampy](https://pypi.org/project/backports.pampy/) using [lib3to6](https://pypi.org/project/lib3to6/). I didn't have a timer running, but I'd be surprised if I spent more than 4 hours on it.
Oh, I see the video now! Thanks!
I don't know what you're asking for specifically. I have a series of Python and JavaScript packages and I need to run tests against them. This entails downloading dependencies (if they're not already downloaded) and running tests for packages who have changed (or who have dependencies that have changed). I need Python integration because my app is in Python and I need to make sure that the build tool provisions an environment with the right Python interpreter and the dependencies such that my tests will run. Ideally I can use the same build tool to build my Docker images (copying my source code and the entire dependency tree for a service into an image with the right version of the interpreter, etc).
Thank you, best of luck to you too.
Would a Makefile do the job for you?
In your CI job, do you download your dependencies and run all tests with each build? Or do you have some sort of incremental build system? We're running into a problem where building and testing are taking too long (half an hour), and we're trying to figure out how to shorten the cycle.
you should probably add passwords.csv to .gitignore edit: and if you actually published your real facebook password you should obviously change it. There's bots that just scrap git hub for things like that. 
I don’t use these passwords, more just for show.
Meson build ?
Is "acceptance testing" where your automated full-stack tests run? Also, how long do your CI jobs take? And of that time, how much is spent building the image? And how many images are built in a job? Do you have only one image/service or many? If many, do they each have their own CI pipelines? Sorry for the many questions; I'm trying to get our CI/CD infrastructure up and running and it seems like we're facing many problems that you've already solved. :)
that's just like the exact opposite passwords are for. Write a documentation, add examples just don't make people who clone your repo (or at this point most likely yourself) commit their passwords by not paying attention. 
I am so fucking happy right now. Had this problem for 2 weeks. 
*Hey just noticed..* it's your **6th Cakeday** bacondev! ^(hug)
Why don't you just use Make, Gradle, etc to build your Docker images, run tests inside the container, and publish the image to a registry. Your build tool won't care about what takes place inside the image, just the entry points it needs to touch to engage your test runner, for example.
I’d suggest looking into nix and maybe hydra. 
allow me to fast review: * `Server.ClientHandlers` is leaky (it’s never cleared on threads termination) * use try/finally structure in `Receiver`

I personally don’t see your point tbh. The code is there and if you read through you will know that the passwords are randomly generated. I will always check commits anyway. Also these are just passwords no email.

I have a super simple commit-hook, where I check which files that are ahead of master and run linting on them. This is of course just abash script that runs locally on my machine, but maybe it's something you could get inspired from. If you have a list of files that have been updated, depending on how your repository is structured, you could just test and build the services that were affected.
Lol can't, the con of that tool is that it only works for a website that is using 1 server. That way they both communicate 1 on 1, but if there are sub servers also communicating then the tool won't be as useful because it it will also have to go through the other servers which might not all have the same configuration. But i will be adding a feature soon to where you can block the communication of the traffic, perhaps when a user makes an account or tries to make an account it won't work Because the tool would be blocking the request.

great information. I am curious though, if you do have audio files or images in their respective directories and you place a blank \_\_init\_\_.py file in those directories, will the audio files and images be accessible as well? even if there's no other python script in those directories?
Thanks and thanks for the explanation. It's hard to find github and info that's....relevant? Bc I feel like I'm learning Spanish in classic form while everyone around me speaks the half American version lol
We use Nix elsewhere in our organization, but it's pretty demanding. You end up writing expressions to build all sorts of obscure low-level C projects and other things. It seems cool in principle, but it's hard to get right in practice. Thanks for the suggestion though!
Surprised there was no mention of creating a `__main__.py` file. They create a very nice, obvious ingress point into your application, and specifically, help denote that it's an "application" and not a "library". 
Report it as a bug to Redhat and Ubuntu then.
I wish nix had stronger industry backing, as it’s seems like “the correct” way to do language agnostic configuration and deploying and so on, but there are some pain points that would be fixed if there was more use of it.
Hi there, from the /r/Python mods. We have removed this post as it is not suited to the /r/Python subreddit proper, however it should be very appropriate for our sister subreddit /r/LearnPython or for the r/Python discord: https://discord.gg/3Abzge7. The reason for the removal is that /r/Python is dedicated to discussion of Python news, projects, uses and debates. It is not designed to act as Q&amp;A or FAQ board. The regular community is not a fan of "how do I..." questions, so you will not get the best responses over here. On /r/LearnPython the community and the r/Python discord are actively expecting questions and are looking to help. You can expect far more understanding, encouraging and insightful responses over there. **No matter what level of question you have, if you are looking for help with Python, you should get good answers**. Make sure to check out the rules for both places. Warm regards, and best of luck with your Pythoneering!
You could look at running the building and running tests inside Docker build, via Docker multistage builds. So you'd just trigger a Docker Build on the subproject and build and tests would be run within their own images.
Try https://bazel.build 
&gt;Is "acceptance testing" where your automated full-stack tests run? Acceptance testing i'm defining as the manual end to end done by qa and eventually the product owner through the browser. \&gt; Also, how long do your CI jobs take? And of that time, how much is spent building the image? \~4 minutes at the moment. \~1 minute to build the image our ruby codebase that's being replaced takes about 10 minutes(guess why we're replacing it :)) it's not exactly incremental but I think starting from a good base image saves some time. We dont start from ubuntu and then update all the stuff and install latest python and dev headers etc for each build. instead. We cut a base image as needed and then all docker images inherit from that. &amp;#x200B; base python image built only when there's a new version of python or alpine updates we become aware of FROM python:3.7.1-alpine3.8 RUN apk update &amp;&amp; \ apk add bash &amp;&amp; \ apk add postgresql-libs &amp;&amp; \ apk add --virtual .build-deps gcc musl-dev postgresql-dev &amp;&amp; \ apk add libffi-dev &amp;&amp; \ rm -fr /var/cache/apk/* ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED 1 &amp;#x200B; every api build(Dockerfile) &amp;#x200B; from company/python:latest as base COPY . /src WORKDIR /src RUN python setup.py bdist_wheel &amp;&amp; \ pip install --no-cache dist/*.whl gunicorn meinheld &amp;&amp; \ cp -r ./tests /tests &amp;&amp; \ cp ./*.ini /tests # &amp;&amp; \ rm -fr /src WORKDIR / EXPOSE 80 COPY config.py /config.py \&gt; And how many images are built in a job? with codeship pro you can build/push as many as you want. but codeship pro is also designed to be one ci per repository out of the box I haven't figured out how to drive off multiple repos but i've been told it's possible. So, I can have one codebase and build many service images off it when the unit tests pass, the only difference in docker images is the entry point(same code) &amp;#x200B; built when unittests complete without issue adt service(Dockerfile.adt) from company/api:latest CMD gunicorn -c /config.py api.adt.app:app reference data service(Dockerfile.ref) from company/api:latest CMD gunicorn -c /config.py api.reference.app:app I dont know if this is the optimal way to accomplish this, but it seems to be working out ok so far.
i think i probably answered you above. :)
And what's the project?
What's wrong with pip install? Requirements files support version locking and hash verification. 
Hello World ;)
It isn't a view, it is a copy at least for the builtins list, tuple, str, bytes. Of course custom classes can do anything they like, but try it for yourself: py&gt; s = "abcdefg" py&gt; type(s[::-1]) &lt;class 'str'&gt; For lists, they have to be a copy, because lists are mutable. Otherwise you modify the reversed view and the original would change too: py&gt; a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] py&gt; b = a[::-1] py&gt; b[0] = 999 py&gt; a [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] py&gt; b [999, 4, 3, 2, 1] 
I have looked through the Automate book before. It seemed fine but this is the book I used (link below). It is not a book for new programmers, but if you have several years of Java then it won't pose any problems. I'm no expert, but I think the differences between Python 2 or 3 are overstated by people who don't want to have to fix existing code. I can understand that, but from a "going forward" perspective for new learners it should be a non issue. Good luck http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920028154.do
Or just use IPython? I'll just use IPython.
Ask questions, ask for help, just don't ask people to do the work for you. &amp;#x200B; r/learnpython might be a better resource, but in general, if the questions show you are actually trying you will probably get some support here, also try stackoverflow, but with the same caveats.
That's cool, I'll check that out. What are the main differences between the 2 you would say? This book also seems to have theory too, how much would you say? Because I have recently become interested in theory too
Typing game with different difficulties, the user selects a difficulty and then is presented a string and they have to type the same thing out 
What does this improve compared to a Makefile and watch make tests ?
 y0, y1 = y1, y0 - q * y1 and y0 = y1 y1 = y0 - q * y1 are not the same. Operations on the right side of `=` are computed *before* the assignment happens, so `y0` is not yet `y1` when `y0 - q * y1` is computed. 
`watch` triggers periodically not on changes. `watchcode` offers more precise control over the trigger behavior and adds features like debouncing, pretty logging, system notifications, and better audio feedback.
pip can read the dependencies from setup.py and install them for you. It also allows you to install things in developer mode so that you don't need to redo pip when you make changes.
Hi, I am sure there people out there who are plenty more experienced than myself and have better advice. From everywhere I have read python is a great language to start with. It is pretty straight forward and is quickly becoming one of the most popular languages. I use python at my current job for data manipulation and day visualization. I also am currently building a discord bot with my friend using python. The way I got into pyhton was a book recommended by a friend and a udemy course. I'll link both below. [The Self-Taught Programmer](The Self-Taught Programmer: The Definitive Guide to Programming Professionally https://www.amazon.com/dp/0999685902/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_i_MUJtCb0XXDN7K) [Udemy Course](https://www.udemy.com/share/1000kmBEIZeF9QQHo=/)

Thanks for the link! The telenovela video was a bit out of place; although a nice change up.
So you mean I can go to a web page to run `myScript &amp;&amp; rm -rf /`? How convenient!
ohh I see, so if I computed it before hand and then set it, it should work then! I'll try that! Thanks!
Yeah, very much agree. :(
Doesn't support Python 3 :(
You could use python to solve or automate some of your personal tasks. Get a raspberry and cron job the python scripts on it. 
I'm sure your parents would be proud of you.
Yes. Buy a raspberry pi and do a fun project with it.
yup i had to precompute those variables and it worked. thanks! 
Amazon allows you to export an Excel doc with all your purchases fyi
You can make challenges for yourself. For example, I had myself make a phone book, which let's you add, delete, replace, and access numbers. This is where creativity comes into play with coding. Either that or you can go on this website https://www.hackerrank.com it gives you different challenges and let's you choose the level of difficulty for the challenges. 
I thought your name looked familiar from my other comment... you are so helpful and I cannot express how grateful I am that you are patient with beginner questions. 
Oh wow, recklessness. This is beyond cowboy programming, this is almost reach Trump level programming. "There's no way the Russian can't gain access.... Oh crapp... We still need to build that Firewall... BUILD THAT WALL!!!"
Bazel and Pants are the primary build systems for monorepos. They're both still quite immature, though (last time I was using Bazel it didn't even *really* support Python at all). But your best bet is probably still to use one of them, and swear a lot. IIRC, Bazel will work fine for Py3 apps as long as that's what `python` resolves to. So you just have to do some finagling in the system you're running the builds in.
You are welcome. Try to do the same on topics you have a bit of knowledge box or in the future ;) By the way I don't often read `name` so I had not noticed :D
I will! :) 
Are you wanting to code the neural network completely in Python from the ground up or are you looking to use something like TensorFlow in Python? The [first two courses in this Deep Learning Coursera specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) walks you through building a numpy based vectorized deep neural network. The first course can be taken without paying and all the notebooks are available to you. You build a fully functional deep network that recognizes cats. The 2nd course is about regularization and you can still watch all the videos and it goes over types of regularization, normalization, and hyper parameters. However to access the notebooks where you implement them requires paying for the course. At the end of the course 2 it walks you through TensorFlow in the final notebook. I have taken the first two to understand the internals of neural networks. I am just starting the 3rd course. You don’t need to know a ton of Python to take this class. And the math is not terribly hard to follow. Calculus helps.

Beautifully explained
There are several threads on this type of subject. Depending on the attitude of the company and/or boss, as a real ROI can be shown in the time savings alone, there could be several outcomes. * You just scripted your whole division out of a job. But you may luck out since you are intimate with the code. You may stay on to maintain the code. * At least one employee is now seen as replaceable and gets let go * your whole team is reassigned or is now given new responsibilities. You will be expected to maintain your code as well as heavily document said code so it can be maintained by someone else, like a consultant when you eventually leave for greener pastures. I've been working since 1987 and in my experience, EVERY company is more interested in saving money and really couldn't care about the employee. If one of your boss's goal for this year is to come up with some money savings in their department, you better believe that your code is the holy grail that will bring a hefty raise and/or promotion, he WILL throw you under the bus. However, If this is a small family organization, it may turn out more positive because of how close everyone is with each other. No risk = no gain. Don't be cocky though. Make notes for speaking points and stay focused on what you are talking about. Remember YearlyManhours * AvgHourlyRate works out to a significant amount of savings. manhours is how many hours you all spend working to get the finished product completed. AvgHourlyRate is the hourly rate averaged, even from salary

I understand the theory of NN. My problem is converting my java NN to python. Should I just build from the ground up? Are there convertors? My Java NN was a multiclass system. From what I understand about Python, that shouldn't be a problem, correct?

If you read the whole thread, you see some asking for the code to be shared. Sometimes just mentioning something makes the lightbulb go on for others. I find it fun just reading what people have done.
One thing I’ve learned over the years, when first learning structures and design concepts like this, it can be really easy to accidentally over complicate your own work by forcing something that could easily be a single file into this type of structure. Just as a tip as you learn, remember this structure has its place in certain designs and single file scripts do as well equally. I ask myself before starting “how often am I going to reuse this code”. If the answer is often I go with a package structure, or if I notice I end up rewriting the same type of code in a bunch of single file scripts, I modularize that code. Just something to keep in mind :)
You can have multiple classes in Python. You could start over or even use one of the machine neural network packages. TensorFlow is cross platform and your model could be used in just about any language. If you do decide to write it from scratch in python, the one thing that is nice about the first course is it teaches how to write it in vectorized form using numpy. Which means it is very fast. Strictly speaking converting java directly to python may not be the most efficient code given the way python works. However, it would still work. And if efficiency isn’t an issue, they it will definitely be fine.

I used `not isinstance` at first, but I read somewhere that it internally runs `type`, so I switched to that. What's better? About the other iterables - I planned on adding new ones as and when I came across them or discovering them via someone's PR!

https://github.com/twisted/klein You would only really hear of it if you use Twisted for all of your async networking, which we do. It uses werkzeug, which is what Flask uses for routing, and hooks it up to the Twisted networking stack. We just use it as a light microframework for providing REST based APIs to be consumed by web frontends.
Looks great! Will take a look at this. Thanks!

you want subplots, and plot to the axis, instead of using the plt.plot https://matplotlib.org/gallery/subplots_axes_and_figures/subplots_demo.html 
I need them to be on the same plot like this: &amp;#x200B; [https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Seneffs-Cochlear-Filterbank-Frequency-Response\_fig2\_228731750](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Seneffs-Cochlear-Filterbank-Frequency-Response_fig2_228731750)
Does it work on windows?
In what way does it not support Python 3? I use it for an extensive Python3 codebase. It's main weakness is poor support for exporting pip friendly libraries.
You haven't given us enough information about your setup to explain how to do this, but in general your data should all be in the same container, probably a pandas dataframe, and then you can plot all the columns in the dataframe with a single call. 
You can plot a 2d array, just careful about your slicing syntax 
Maybe I will give that another shot. When I do this in a single line it combines all of the data points together onto a single same colored plot, and parts where the filters overlap are not represented. I must have just set them wrong. 
I had my first experience needing to move beyond single files recently and created my first package. It's now a significant software package for a multi-million dollar research project in a national lab. My ignorance might come back to bite them in the ass.
I do not know what you mean. I am plotting a 2D array, and I am looking for a simple way to do that. 
Sweet! Just made a few things with click at work. What was your original use case?
You are not likely to find much information on Iron python here, while it is a form of python it is quite different in many ways to (C)Python. There is a pretty active hitter chat with community members and some of the core devs who do a good job of answering you can get to here: https://gitter.im/IronLanguages/ironpython Outside of that SO has a lot of information as well. Wpf is great, while more initial investment in time than winforms, it is easier to keep a clean project down the road. There are some examples of embedded ipy projects with console windows and the like out there too. Ipy is a great option to augment .NET apps and extend functionality, or build a core if you will, depending on the goal you can do a lot in ipy. We use it quite a bit as an embedded plugin system with great results but it really depends on what your goal is and why you think you want to use ipy.
Very cool. What are you planning on using this for?
pretty superb, not even my jealousy (I wanted to absolve the cli/web distinction for ages) can make my smile go away
I like using [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) to manage the building/integrating/testing of my applications. Building my app consists of simply running `docker-compose build`. Pushing my app's container(s) to the remote registry is `docker-compose push`. Since one of the "services" I create is just a test runner, testing becomes `docker-compose run test`. I manage higher-level orchestration (such as deployments [swarm|kubernetes|other]) using [invoke](http://www.pyinvoke.org/). Configuration is all contained within `.env` files I reference in my `docker-compose.yaml` or `invoke.yaml` files.
Neat. Though I'm curious why you create a subprocess instead of invoking the command directly. Presumably this is for handling long running tasks? It also looks like you only handle one command, any plans to extend it out to support multiple commands?
Very informational. Thanks .
It does support python3 look harder. Bazel is the best thing out there for “language agnostic build system.” 
make sure when you slice its still 2d. to test, just try printing it out. test = randn(10,2) plot(test) gives you two lines on the same plot.
How is this better/different than FreeCAD? How about a blurb on the project and a link to the project, rather than a reddit thread?
you need a bash terminal and before the three commands listed you have to run cat [app.py](https://app.py) I used the bash that came with my git gui install
No I don’t use Linux. It just doesn’t work like I want. My code just works on it 99.9% of the time because it’s not that different. .i find Linux packaging and ststem configurations confusing. I can’t find a desktop interface that is as good as my Windows environment. Seriously, where is my tabbed explorer that I have on Windows with QtTabBar? I don’t have a way to properly make/edit Word and Excel files. Shoot, why can’t LibreOffice handle PowerPoint files properly; it’s the easiest of all of them. I find having a python that exists on the system that I shouldn’t use confusing. I don’t really see any advantages that I can’t get with Cygwin.
is there any way to make it accessible by other machines on the local network?
I was literally about to mention git. Lol I have git gui so I guess I’m legit 
Add `--host=0.0.0.0` after the `flask run`
Looks good (:
Very cool. Is the music part of the application or did you just add it in for the video? It's very atmospheric and I liked it. I'm no expert on text adventures but that looked pretty cool.
www.python.org I've dabbled in several languages and python has had the best docs by far. There's little you can't do if you're persistent and read the docs. And it all translates into skills that will make you a better programmer in any language. I say go for it.
As an engineer at NASA, your comment is oddly discouraging and encouraging at the same time... I've only ever written tests for very specific bits of my code, but certainly not done TDD. Obviously I'm not writing flight software or anything - just personal helpful tools.
Thank you very much for your tip, will improve once I'm at home! 
Invoking in a subprocess is the most generic approach - otherwise a CLI app that does e.g. `os._exit` can ruin everything. Also it allows you to get the exit code which can be important.
Anywhere with a Python installation and the require packages - git or bash shouldn’t be necessary. 
Does this support click sub commands? Haven’t been able to try it out yet. 
This should be in the /r/learnpython. I think you would need to look into screen recognition modules, and go from there. Would have to find a way to distinguish the diamond.
Setup.py does other kinds of things besides package dependencies. It handles various meta data, entry points, including data and Even running prenand post install scripts.
Cool! I was thinking of similar thing but for desktop GUI.

+1 for make. Its almost exactly what OP wants. There are python specific tools like PipEnv and Poetry, but I often find myself just going back to Make. 
Thanks for the answer I goal is to build an engineering application (involves a lot of thermodynamics) with a gui So it seemed pretty easy to work with wpf ironpython but from what i've read online there is a problem with ironpython running packages like numpy and others which won't help at all if true
Doesn't hug do something like this?
Forgive my possibly dumb question, but I'm pretty new to programming; how was the video created? Does the program just dump individual frames as images that then have to be combined into a video, or does it export it all as a video / gif? It's pretty neat none-the-less!
I'm an experienced programmer. This year I want to learn python and use the power of it for both on my personal fun projects and for some job stuff! I'm still reading, reading and reading Python books :) 1- "Illustrated Guide to Python" (finished!) 2- "Learning Python" by Fabrizio Romano (still reading...) 3- "The Quick Python Book, Third Edition" by Naomi Ceder (this will be the last one) I've read more than 800 pages from 2 books but, oh boy, there are still hundredths of pages more ! At the end of this marathon, I'll be finished reading 3 books and feel more comfortable with the basics I suppose.
It's different: FreeCAD is a mechanical CAD, this is an (educational) tool for designing RF and microwave circuits. The only point which may make it relevant to this subreddit is that it is fully written in Python, using Qt. I did not write a blurb because i thought that the blurb on the cross-posted thread would suffice.

Love it! I always thought that it is about to time to make truly portable GUI applications by using a browser. The next step is generating Javascript in order to update and modify elements on the page.

According to Wikipedia, Youtube uses Python, Go, C, C++ and Java for the backend.
Yes it does, and subcommands can be nested how deep you like.
Yes it should. I have tested with git bash, but it should work in windows command prompt as well.
Lots of python is used with physics and science in general for various things. So yeah... Not a bad idea. I'd research how python is used in your field via Google and learn that =) If you can't find something that makes sense to you then focus on your books. You can always pick up python later. 
Since I can never remember the order which matplotlib accepts 2D arrays, I usually loop using `zip` for these cases: fig, ax = plt.subplots() for bank, m in zip(filterbank, mag): ax.plot(bank, m) 
This is propably not the right place to ask and the error is not very specific. You may want to open an issue on the project page: [https://github.com/sabat54i/photoboothdiy](https://github.com/sabat54i/photoboothdiy) 
150 lines that are now less maintainable and less expressive. I like to make use of unpacking generalizations, type annotations, f literals, and so on. Backporting would just make all that code ugly
Am I misunderstanding something? How does the author come to this conclusion: &gt; I think that the dichotomy between fast compiling languages and slow scripting languages is a bluff. What happened ultimately was that \*compiled\* code was run. It isn't hard to see why interpreted languages are by definition always slower than compiled languages - they are slower because you need an interpreter.
I tend to use supervisord to run multiple gunicorn instances and just proxy the vhost traffic from nginx to them
Maybe you can hook into our swagger-to? ([https://github.com/Parquery/swagger-to](https://github.com/Parquery/swagger-to))
I could probably have done that, but I've found that I'm usually in favor of whatever the laziest solution is. In this case, I used QuickTime to do a screen recording, then edited the video. Took a little post-processing, but it was easier than figuring out how to build gifs in Python (though I'm sure there's probably a library that takes in a list of image objects and spits out a gif. This *is* Python we're talking about here).
Notice that the source of backports.pampy has [all the original type annotations](https://github.com/mbarkhau/pampy/blob/master/src/backports/pampy/pampy.py), and yet you can still do pip install backports.pampy on python2.7, or use f strings and install on a python3.5 interpreter for that matter. This is courtesy of [lib3to6](https://gitlab.com/mbarkhau/lib3to6) that I plugged, which allows you to develop using every feature that you mentioned and have it be transpiled to a backward compatible syntax only for the files that go into the distributed packages.
Oh, so if I'm understanding right these graphs were generated in real-time inside some sort of GUI, that you used screen recorder to capture, correct?

Hmm... Do you need to compile code to .exe? Or you just want to run your code? I think that you are looking for IDE - try Pycharm :) 
You're looking for an IDE, not a compiler. PyCharm is a good one for Python. 
- Clonenames - Kodenames Sorry that’s all I got :(
Yeah, you're def right. I have no idea what I'm talking about. 
Ah, thanks! I have installed it. When I try to run my code tho it says I have no "Project interpreter"? Do you happen to know what that means? 
It looks nice! A few remarks: 1. Why didn't you link to the github page? That's where all the information is (https://github.com/Parquery/icontract, for the lazy) 2. Does it validate types based on annotations? That's unclear from the readme. Maybe the syntax can be a little less clunky if I could write some of the constraints (like &gt;0) inside the annotations somehow, instead of with decorators. 3. How about supporting dataclass annotations as well? It could be much nicer than lots of invariant decorators. 4. How about making a few performance benchmarks? If I consider using this in a real project, I'd be interested how much slowdown I should expect for straight-forward usage (10%? 20%? who knows).
Yep! I used matplotlib to generate them, then captured using screen recorder. Saving the images and turning them into a gif with Pillow would have worked too though (and would have been "cleaner").
Python doesn't have a compiler. Python is an interpreted language. Preloaded.
1. Terribly slow. 2. Mostly doesn't work with private package servers (broken). 3. Inconsistent (whatever your requirements are, you may end up having different sets of packages installed on different runs). It, basically, only works for trivial no-brainer cases, like installing Django + a couple of very popular other packages, if you stray from a beaten path, then you'll run into all sorts of weird corner cases.
Looks great!!
Oh okay, thanks for the explanation! Matplotlib is a bit too complicated for me haha I mean, heck, I barely know how to use PyQT, no way in heck I'd be able to work with Matplotlib or any graphic creation libraries. As much as I enjoy creating projects with python, my brain isn't wired for programming and I gotta really force it to understand anything more than 2 layers deep, programming wise(99% of the posts on this sub is way over my head haha). A bit of a ramble, my bad :3 What I'm trying to say is, great job on the work! It certainly is interesting. 
Dont get me wrong. Im python newbie as well. It would be more clear and faster if you check youtube. For this matter gor example "setting python interpreter in pycharm". I look almost every simple problems there.
Wow this is amazing and might be just the thing we need at work. Thank you!
Well, Gparted should give you a friendly GUI... Terminal by itself doesn't do partitioning. Most likely you'd use `parted` program (which is what Gparted is based on). The way you'd partition your USB (if you are only going to use it with Linux) would be something along these line: parted /dev/{where-is-your-usb} mklabel gpt mkpart primary {X}s {Y}s mkpart {Y}s {Z}s Where in order to find out what `X` is you'd look into: (/sys/block/{your-usb-drive}/queue/optimal_io_size + /sys/block/{your-usb-drive}/alignment_offset) / 512 (this number is typically 8192) `Y` then would be `X+{how much you need for the operating system}`. And `Z` would be the end of your USB. I used `s` as a unit, which is a "native" unit for tools that deal with devices (it stands for "sectors"), but `parted` also understands more familiar units, like KB, MB, GB etc. To "install" your system on a USB, simply do something like: dd if=/path/to/iso/you/downloaded.iso of/dev/{your-usb-primary-partition}
Why would you want to swipe right on everyone? It doesn't make sense.
Thanks for the comments! &amp;#x200B; 1. Sorry, wrong copy/paste. I fixed it in the post. 2. Static type validation is part of mypy. icontract handles only run-time checks. I'll clarify that in the readme, thanks for spotting it. The annotation is limited in so far that you can not have complex functions which are how most practical contracts are written. 3. Could you maybe give an example? icontract should support data classes out-of-the-box. 4. The performance benchmarks are included in [https://github.com/Parquery/icontract/tree/master/benchmarks/startup](https://github.com/Parquery/icontract/tree/master/benchmarks/startup). &amp;#x200B;
It would be great to see a source code.
2. I meant that you could allow something like PosInt = Require(int, lambda i: i &gt; 0) def f(a: PosInt, b: PosInt ): pass I don't know if it's possible without interfering with mypy, but that's the interface I would aim for. 3. I meant it as a continuation of #2 @dataclass class A: a: int b: PosInt c: Require(str, lambda s: len(s) &gt; 0) Again, take it as you will. But that's what I would like to have. 4. That's nice! Perhaps you could make it easier for evaluators by posting a graph of the results.
Youtube started as written in Python, that they compiled to C, iirc. But, this was a lifetime ago. Today, there's probably very little if any Python left there. Google mostly like their products to be written in C++, so, my guess would be that most of Youtube is in C++, other languages maybe used occasionally, but for inessential stuff.
Haha thanks! I appreciate the help nonetheless 
I'm not convinced *yet* but it can't hurt to have a look at it and tuck it in the batbelt :)
It means you have to tell it where your Python executable is. You can do this in project settings (AFAIR that message provides you with a link to the relevant settings page). 
Probably you need to install python itself and point that file as interpreter for pycharm. But I would put more confidence in YT than my advice
Your already using ngixn / gunicorn so just use that and run your flask app on a different port.

If I have a sequence of images that I want to be a movie, I don't even use Python. I just throw them into ImageMagick from the command line. `convert *png movie.gif` or whatever the extensions happen to be.
Sublime Text is a beauty
&gt; before the three commands listed you have to run &gt; &gt; cat app.py Can you explain to me why that have to be run?
Aha! So it's not a common code base, but an automatic translation at built time. Sounds good. Certainly with its own drawbacks though.
Here's an example of using a dataframe to contain multiple sets of data so that they're easily plotted together. import pandas as pd from matplotlib import pyplot as plt df = pd.DataFrame({x:[x*10, x*10+5, x*10+10] for x in range(8)}) df The dataframe now has three rows and eight columns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 0 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 1 5 15 25 35 45 55 65 75 2 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 So plot directly from the pandas dataframe: fig, ax1 = plt.subplots(1,1,figsize=(4,4)) df.plot(ax=ax1) ax1.legend(bbox_to_anchor=(1.3, 1)) The plot [plot](https://i.imgur.com/1FouVct.png) all eight columns on the same chart.

Have you considered using Docker? Works on Digital Ocean, is usually super simple to set-up and has been really reliable for me in the past.
If you are happy with \`watch\` that's fine ;) I've been using it myself for quite some time. &amp;#x200B; The next step was inotifywait but I had to maintain two files, one which specifies what to wait for (I preferred to put it in a file so that I don't have to re-specify any time I work on the project), another for the commands (e.g. a makefile). Setting it up was always a bit too tedious to make it a habit. With \`watchcode\` my goal was to have a single file setup running in seconds (the \`--init-config\` feature). &amp;#x200B; In many situations \`watch\` works pretty well. Rerunning on changes is mainly important for me when working on a GUI app, where I have a graphical window popping up when re-running. This doesn't play nicely with \`watch\` ;).

I'm very interested in knowing what discourages and encourages you, please tell me more about your experience. To clarify a bit, my personal view is definitely not that "if you don't do TDD you are bad/doomed/stupid". I share with people my discovery of a practice that can help and simplify the creation and maintenance of software. I wrote tons of tools, utilities, scripts and also some production systems without TDD. They worked. And some times they costed me more time, eventually, than they would have if done following TDD. Also, TDD and testing are not the same thing: TDD is one of many aspects of testing, as I tried to point out showing integration tests in the last chapter. I guess if you want to send something in space you definitely cannot do it with TDD only.
Right now it’s called pySpy, which a) is lazy, and b) already exists. Someone just mentioned Clonenames below, I really like that. I think I may go with that! I’ll post the repo soon with a new name!
Ohhhhh, I’m a big fan of Clonenames. I might steal that. It’s obviously a clone of existing IP, so I like the word clone being in the name. I’ll post the repo soon. Thanks for the suggestions!
Very cool - I’ll definitely give this a try.

Looks like you are joining the input name before the c:/templates
Python is a programming language, languages aren't "interpreted" or "compiled" in themselves. CPython, the reference Python implementation written in C contains both a compiler and interpreter. Before modules are run or imported by the CPython interpreter, they are compiled to bytecode.
For 2), maybe something like if typing.TYPE_CHECKING: PosInt = typing.NewType(int) else: PosInt = Require(int, lambda i: i &gt; 0)
Thank you for the amazing details! Sounds a bit hard for some noob like me but I am willing to give it a try. I might come back with more questions though 😉
Thanks ! I just did it : [https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/akn5jl/just\_released\_timecalc\_do\_time\_calculations\_in/](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/akn5jl/just_released_timecalc_do_time_calculations_in/)
&gt; As for me, I would really like to have a watch on variables and a possibility to run blocks of code separately (like in Jupyter). What about [Spyder](https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder)? It has both things (and much more, of course). Disclaimer: I'm the Spyder maintainer, so this is just a bit of self-promotion.
The official documentation lists Python 3 support as experimental and there are dozens of tickets about how Python 3 is broken. I’d love some tips on how to get it working.
Yeah, I really want to use Bazel. Unfortunately the official documentation lists Python 3 support as experimental and there are dozens of tickets about how Python 3 is broken in Bazel. I’ve searched high and low for workarounds. I’d love some tips on how to get it working.
okay thank you! I need to look to have the input inbetween somehow. 
Make might not be a bad choice, but we build on a cluster and Make doesn’t have a cluster build story to my knowledge. If one worker builds something and nothing changes, the next build on another worker will rebuild everything. Also we tend to terminate workers frequently and a full rebuild of everything would take hours.
awesome, saved and will examine after work. Thank you for sharing this :D
Oh... Gotcha. Yeah, it looks `old.reddit.com` uses a different Markdown parser than the new interface - looked fine on the new interface, which is why I didn't notice... Thanks!
That would be neat. We build on a cluster though, and afaik you can’t share a build cache across hosts, so if you build everything on one worker, the next build on a different worker will need to build everything as well even if nothing has changed. We terminate our workers frequently, and a full rebuild takes hours, so this wouldn’t work for us. Also Docker’s build cache assumes a linear dependency graph; I’m sure we could shoehorn it in, but I doubt anyone would call it maintainable.
Thanks. That’s kind of the conclusion I’m coming to. But judging by the issue tracker for Py3 support, I will need a lot of swears to get off the ground. :(
The `cat` command just displays the contents of the file. It's used demonstratively to show that the py file is using click. It's not actually required. :D
That’s a nice setup! Unfortunately I can’t use solutions that depend on the Docker daemon’s build cache for reasons mentioned elsewhere in this thread. Still, very nice suggestion.
I’m not familiar.
Had a bunch of useful scripts that other than developers should be able to run and creating UI for each would be more work than creating the script in the first place. This way I only have to write the scripts ;)
Are these cellular automata?
the command "cat" just prints the contents of the file to the terminal :)
Why not just use electron then?
Hi @Ritiek, the fascinating thing about your project is how it has grown to a loved Python cli from a simple script. It gives many tips to how to scale an open source project. Yeah, I too have heard good things about django codebase. Thanks for linking it!!
Matplotlib can also generate videos all on its own. The API is admittedly a bit clunky but I have found it very useful for when I want to automatically generate videos. You can look into [matplotlib.animation](https://matplotlib.org/api/animation_api.html) if you're interested. 
I want to see the codes 
Hug looks great and is a bit similar but focus and use case seems a different. Click-web is for projects that are CLI focused but want a web interface as a nice to have without any extra work.
https://github.com/wooey/Wooey same idea but established 2015
Very cool! I would like it if the last parameter values were retained when going back after running the script. This would help in cases where you want to tweak some parameters, so you run a script several times with slightly different values. Even better would be if the output showed up under the "Run" button without loading a new page. 
I wouldn't use Electron for a small app, because it's huge, slow and bloated. Imagine a printer dialogue with 400kb of python code and 128Mb of Overhead.
Now this is interesting question I m waiting for answers Sorry can't answer the question I m riding bike 
Is this based on competition equations? What are the principles behind this?
Or different domain/subdomain
True, I guess it depends on the constraints of your system. I personally just create a flask app running on a gevent wsgi server then turn it into an executable with a qt browser included. Although that's allot of overhead sometimes. Have you heard of pysimplegui?
If you want a real beginner alternative, Thonny is a good place to start as well. When you get better, I recommend anaconda or something.
congrats you figured out im coding on an operating system
Did you use matplotlib? How did you do real time plotting like that?

I'm usually splitting my code into separate modules if the project is not that big or complex. If it reaches a certain point of complexity I'm usually diving it into separate packages that are easily reusable. It really depends on type of the project you're working on, but most of the time diving your code into separate files is a good idea

A lot of this article (such as interning integers in the range -5 to 256) are version or implementation specific and not defined by the language itself.
kk thanks
Just stated learning Python, so dictionary’s lists and functions so far. Loving the language. 
GvR wrote [STDWIN](https://github.com/thomas-hori/mirror-cwi-stdwin) back in the 90s and I thought it was for Python programs. But turns out if was for C programs.
If you're a beginner to programming, you should definitely check out [Mu](https://codewith.mu/), which is made specifically for that.

Another one? Fuck me.
"I don't like Python's design" != "Python is worse". Nothing about your rant has anything to even do with Web development. 
If you're going to pull from the back of the textbook, yeah. But it behaves like any other interpreted language, on the front end.
No all the code will be in python and python packages like numpy and scipy i'm only considering ironpython for the drag and drop, modern gui design 
Nice! I made the other one, it would be cool to see how you solved migration, eating etc. I'll share mine soon:) And what was the occasion? for fun or maybe a school project?
Not that complicated at all, matplotlib has a feature to directly exporting to GIF without anything extra! :)
Did you not use `matplotlib` to generate the graphs? If you did, you can save animations to mp4s and use any number of free services out there to convert to a gif. That's my usual strategy, anyway.

&gt; This make is very hard for IoC techniques to be implemented correctly. Not really - https://github.com/metaperl/python-oop/wiki/Dependency-Injection &gt; PHP has Traits, So does Python - https://traitlets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/ &gt; Python has Mixins. But because Mixins are the way to do inheritance, I feel they are way overused The [Nagare web framework](http://www.nagare.org) uses composition not inheritance. You also have the [multi-methods and generic functions](https://github.com/metaperl/python-oop#multimethods). &gt; To start, there isn't really a public, private, or protected attribution Well first you rail on single dispatch OOP and then you get upset because single dispatch OOP concepts like public, private and protected dont exist. &gt; Moving along, there isn't types for functions or variables. Hopefully Python will get F# type inference so you dont have to mention types. But I only see the benefit of types in languages like ML or Haskell. I prefer speed of development and a good test suite over having to manually specify types. The use of objects everywhere means your program is well-typed by the OO metods.

Plants grow if they already exist or have a plant next to them. Herbivores eat plants, and have a chance to a) reproduce, b) move around if there isn't enough food to eat, and c) die if they can't eat. Carnivores are similar, but eat herbivores, have different tuning on reproduction and hunger. &amp;#x200B; It took some tuning to get a sustainable ecosystem - the boom and bust cycles you can see in the population graph get out of hand easily.
I'd just like to point out that you don't need parallelism (as you probably mean it) for such simple tasks. You simply need asynchronous tasks. The difference is subtle but important
"Cloudless", seriously? Was "client-side" not hype enough for the marketing folks? 
What is an "interpreted language" and how does it behave? Because I have never heard it in a way that wasn't based on a fundamental misunderstanding how computers and programming languages work.
Let me know if it works. I'm curious to see how well this works for other data sets.
Same. I really need to know a proper way for exporting it to exe. If u find sth could u share it with me? I've googled but nothing useful showed up
Please simulate a meteor hitting the island and the ensuing chaos.
You sir are a hero. 
You are not compiling first. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreted_language An interpreted language is a type of programming language for which most of its implementations execute instructions directly and freely, **without previously compiling** a program into machine-language instructions.
Point 1 is not correct, Python has [abstract base classes](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/abc.html) you can't instantiate without implementing all abstract methods. Point 2 is subjective and not something I've ever come across in a decade of Python. Point 3 is subjective: yes, data hiding is generally not enforced in Python but you're still expected to respect it. Python expect everyone to be an adult, and if that's not your speed that's perfectly fine but PHP is pretty terrible in that regard because not only are there a lot of things you can but should not do, it's not following any kind of consistent rules. You just have to remember not to use `mysql_escape_string`, for example. Point 4: phrased confusingly, but I think you should check out MyPy, which does static type checking for Python. Point 5: I don't know much about multi-threading in Python either, but most of the time you'll be better served by multi-processing or async event loops for what you want to do in Python anyway.
Yes
They're still compiled first. Just because you don't specify it on the command line manually doesn't change it. Also, this is a property of an implementation, not a language.
Lots of CA other than Life have been explored, including ones like this! This type is referred to as having multiple cellstates -- Life has just two states, ON and OFF, whereas this kind has more than one ON state, each of which interacts with each other state differently.
You are chasing your tail on this one. I said &gt; But it behaves like any other interpreted language, *on the front end*. And then do a song and dance about the backend. 
Finally someone said it
Kite's shady. Be cautious approaching any of their products. https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/6p5qjt/a_san_francisco_startup_called_kite_took_over_and
Files to do modules. Proper package, module, and type hierarchy. Don't do comment separators. It's not a way of organizing. Use it to highlight things, not scale things either. Same with code folding. It's a poor crutch around code not being organized coherently.
The original product sent your code to their servers, if I understand correctly, which is a no-go for most closed-source products. “Cloudless” helps them distance themselves from their cloud-based offering.
Uh, yeah? It's just a local variable scoped to the init function if you don't assign it as a property of `self`.
In that case you can use PyQt or PySide with Qt Designer.
[removed]
It's essentially the same as having temporary variables used in a function call, so yeah that is fine. When the function returns, the value of that variable will be lost. But if you make it a class variable using `self.`, it persists until the instance of that class is deconstructed.
Thanks.
Do you mean instance variable instead of self variable?
Thanks. Understood.
I mean calling it 'self.y' instead of just 'y'. The former persists until the instance is removed, and the latter will be gone when the function is done.
Thanks 😊
It appears to be a stochastic cellular automata.
How can I do something similar? what libraries do people usually use for stuff like this? did you do this with OOP approach? I found this very interesting, props to you
I'm trying to understand what the hell you're talking about. What is the front end of a programming language?
The CLI???
It's probably true that `isinstance` uses `type`, but you should still always use `isinstance` because you can subclass other classes like this: &gt;&gt;&gt; class SillyString(str): ... def is_silly(self): ... return self == 'silly' ... &gt;&gt;&gt; len(SillyString('foo')) 3 &gt;&gt;&gt; SillyString('not silly').is_silly() False &gt;&gt;&gt; SillyString('silly').is_silly() True `SillyString` behaves exactly like `str` with the additional `is_silly` method. However, it is a completely separate class and `SillyString == str` is False. `type` returns the class of an object, so `type(SillyString('foo'))` returns `SillyString` and that is not equal to `str`. But `isinstance(SillyString('silly'), str)` returns True because `SillyString` is derived from `str`. That means it's guaranteed that everything `str` does `SilllyString` can do, too. ---- It's impossible to get a complete list of all classes that support counting because you can make any class countable. Observe: &gt;&gt;&gt; class Foo(): ... def __len__(self): ... return 42 ... &gt;&gt;&gt; len(Foo()) 42 In general, you should expect behaviour, not specific classes. You can do that with `try ... except ...`, `hasattr`, `collections.abc` and probably many other ways I can't think of right now. Which method is most appropriate varies. If you insist on hardcoded classes, you only make your code less versatile and harder to maintain. `SillyString` isn't countable according to `php.count` even though it absolutely is. 
Liskov Substitution Principle! I understand what you're saying now.
Try `pyinstaller`. Once installed, it's as simple as running `pyinstaller your_game.py` in command prompt
There's a small library which gives a more user-friendly wrapper around matplotlib.animation called animatplot (https://github.com/t-makaro/animatplot)
If you want to do open source you need to realize that It’s just as much about communication as it is about programming and building things. People will point at you mistakes constantly and you will have to be mature in your reactions to that. Right now you seem very immature and defensive in your responses, that doesn’t end up looking good for you. 
Would love to see the code for both of these. I’ve wanted to do this for years. Just never had the time. 
matplotlib is pretty huge but there are lots of tutorials out there. it's mostly about learning which knobs to fiddle with out of the dozens provided. using something like jupyter as your gui helps.
Okay fair enough, after re-reading I do realise I was being closed minded and not taking it on board. Thanks for the constructive criticism and I’ll add to the readMe stating that the passwords aren’t real and just for show in a file.
As others have said matplotlib’s animation module can also do that, but it’s tough to get started with it. I didn’t find too many tutorials on it when I started, presumably because it’s more niche. I’ve had much better luck with the ArtistAnimation class than the FuncAnimation (or whatever the second one is named as). The downside to the ArtistAnimation is you need to store all your frames in a list or other iterable, which can get slow pretty quickly for long animations. 
Good on them for fixing that if it was criticized. Still, the announcement could have been titled "Code processing is now client-side" which IMO is much clearer. And wouldn't have required anybody to look into what they actually meant after rolling their eyes. 
Yes, it looks very interesting. I had a quick look on this already. Maybe I will try to use it later. &gt; I'm the Spyder maintainer My respect, Sir.
Thanks for the inspiration! I just thought yours was really cool and I wanted to try my hand at it. Plus, I've been lazy recently and figured I should try to code something. Accounting (for things like population, migration, and eating) is done on a per-tile basis, rather than a per-organism basis. So whereas (I think) you simulated all of the animals individually, I simulated the tiles themselves. It should be faster for high-density simulations, but means there may be lots of weird off-by-one errors and lost animals (which luckily don't matter - I'm not trying to make an accurate simulation, just an exploratory one).
That's really interesting, thanks! I will look into it next time I'm doing some animations 
There's an upvote button which serves the same purpose as your comment
#YES
I am also very interested in seeing the code for this, or even a write-up! 
Sounds like exactly what I was imagining making. gonna take it for a drive.
Well, my avatar in github certainly is 
Command list?
Use $movie MOVIENAME
I did something similar in college with Matlab. Our project was to study the effects of malaria (vector borne disease) and transient immunity in humans. We had three equations describing the lifecycle of each subject (mosquito, immune human, susceptible human). Like you said, it can take a while to tune the equations so they work out at a reasonable rate, but our graphs ended up looking a lot like yours.
This would have been really cool in my Biogeography class last semester.
That works make it world readable including the internet if you open a port on your router. :_/
Thank u mate! Does it work on python 3.7 tho? Cuz I've heard it doesn't!

I used numpy to make working with arrays easier and matplotlib for plotting - nothing too in-depth. This actually wasn't OOP, though you could definitely create a class for each type of organism and treat them as individual objects. This is what the original island guy did, and it lets you do things like model how animal behavior changes with age. It's probably the "right" way to do it, but this seemed easier.
How about *Ctrl+Alt+Enter -&gt; Show Quick Actions* It has an important name, but it also doesn't seem to be doing anything.
That they do. As they would in real life, at least until resources ran out. I decided to start with them fully grown to provide a good amount of food for the herbivores.

Wow this is pretty good. Thanks for sharing!
I'm loving these posts! Keep them coming!
This should be asked in /r/learnpython. I am no scraping expert, but if you have a REGEX to look for URL formats, add them to a list, then iterate through the list.
I like your point in point 3: PHP doesn't follow consistent rules. I haven't worked a lot with PHP, but when I did, it was the most frustratingly non-cohesive, inconsistent, slapped together language I've seen. Python, on the other hand, is very consistent and predictable
You should do commit after each insert, not after for loop. You don't see you rows because of it(rows become visible only after commit)
Just posted over there! Thanks, I will look into using REGEX, I appreciate the tip! 
It looks like he used matplotlib
I'll answer the beginner question but it does belong in /r/learnpython. The way python does classes is by passing a reference of the object's instance to each function through the "self" argument. When you create an object all of the state and information associated with that specific copy of the class is created somewhere in memory. When you call a member function we need to somehow provide that context to the function. That's what self is for. In C++ or Java it's called "this" and it's implicitly accessible inside each classes' member functions.
Here's a sneak peek of /r/learnpython using the [top posts](https://np.reddit.com/r/learnpython/top/?sort=top&amp;t=year) of the year! \#1: [Just spent 2 hours to automate joining csv files saving hundreds of hours a year](https://np.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/a085dx/just_spent_2_hours_to_automate_joining_csv_files/) \#2: [I wrote a book on Python Regular Expressions, it is FREE through this weekend](https://np.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/aevgbi/i_wrote_a_book_on_python_regular_expressions_it/) \#3: [Learning Python and managed to save my company thousands per year](https://np.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/a0jqpr/learning_python_and_managed_to_save_my_company/) ---- ^^I'm ^^a ^^bot, ^^beep ^^boop ^^| ^^Downvote ^^to ^^remove ^^| [^^Contact ^^me](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=sneakpeekbot) ^^| [^^Info](https://np.reddit.com/r/sneakpeekbot/) ^^| [^^Opt-out](https://np.reddit.com/r/sneakpeekbot/comments/afd0dd/blacklist/)
Following this post because I'm also interested. 
Well first of all learn the basics through youtube coruses there are plenty of them there. You can search something on pluralsight or udemy... Etc. When you get the basics try to make little projects like snake game or maybe even simpler. Check out this site for challanges: https://projecteuler.net. If you want some books then I can recommend automating boring stuff with python and python crash course or learn the python hard way but the most important thing you need to know it's just to start... Sit for like 4 hours a day or more and code code code code. Good luck mate.
I used a powershell script to save me a couple hours of work. After a few weeks I was talking to another guy in the team and he's been secretly doing the same thing I have and we both kept it a secret from our boss we still have our jobs and new positions because of... hard work.
It's probably a bit late to start on a JIT or GPU support if you want it in Python 4. There's also no need to add a JIT, PyPy is handling that just fine. GPU support already exists in things like PyCUDA. CUDA is made by NVIDIA, who is probably a bit better then Python core devs at accessing GPUs. I mean if we can't get numpy in the standard library, what good is putting a GPU module in there?
They are agents following simple rules which leads to complex emergent behaviour, so yes kinda.
This one's my favourite. I find it interesting how the predator population is very low. We celebrate being on top of the food chain, but as predators maybe we shouldn't be this populous
Sorry there is a typo of indent. I actually commit after reading every line of log. I have no experience of what kind of performance I should expect, in terms of number of logs python can process (just some string extraction and insert and update query). There are currently several hundred lines of logs every second. What do you think may cause the delay in inserting into database (I'm using MySQL). BTW, CPU is at around 50% for mysql and 13% for python script. Thank you!
got it.
I'm not sure this is the problem but it looks like you have an unclosed single quote on the COPY statement

Wanting to become a developer before learning Python, that's quite a jump! But I love your enthusiasm, good luck with it! Unless you have a very good reason, start learning Python 3 (not 2).

Clearly 4.0 should have a major, breaking feature. How about we add a new library, `php`, which will enable access to the PHP standard library and allow Python source files to elegantly interleave code and HTML, PHP style. Naturally, a 3to4.py program will be provided to facilitate painless upgrades. What could be more Pythonic? /s Okay, okay. Honestly, I'd love to see 4.0 spent on overhauling packaging. Remove eggs, easy_install and distutils. And maybe release manylinux2010 before CentOS 6 goes dark like CentOS 5 already has. Make PyPI take over building binary wheels to avoid the inevitable shenanigans of people poisoning binary wheels.

Hi, I added a section in Readme summarizing the benchmark results: [https://github.com/Parquery/icontract#benchmarks](https://github.com/Parquery/icontract#benchmarks). Unfortunately, I don't have time to make the plots, but I hope the numbers can give you a first impression. &amp;#x200B; As I wrote in the conclusion, run-time overhead is there, but I suppose it's justified in most cases by gains in readability (formalized, verifiable and up-to-date docs) and maintenance time. &amp;#x200B; Re 2) and 3): Please note that such annotation is limited to fairly trivial contracts and prevents you from modeling most of the practical ones (such as relations between the arguments; e.g., x &lt; y). I also doubt mypy would play along so I originally decided against it. &amp;#x200B; You can have a look at [https://pypi.org/project/PyContracts/](https://pypi.org/project/PyContracts/) which has more similar syntax to the one you are proposing. However, I doubt such an approach is practical when your correctness needs a higher level of complexity than, say, range checks.
I don't hear anybody complaining about Rust. So, you know what they say

Nice man... what’s next? Fungi?
The very first thing you should do is read the sidebar where it says go to /r/learnpython
I'd like Cython included in std lib, or even support for nogil mode without using separate processes.
Is just xor-ing the data enough or do you need more?
I'm not getting this article at all. None of these proposed features are breaking changes! Why update the version number to 4.0?!
It's been stated many times it is very unlikely there will ever be a 4.0. The "clean break" style compat change was hugely disruptive and basically no one would do it again.
Only problem with putting Cython, or any other module, in the stdlib is the update cycle goes way down. You lose consistent updates at the cost of bundling. 
But... I knew this. It's been brought up numerous times on r/learnpython, too. Not only is the trick with the integers, as u/wikwikwik said implementation specific, it also display different behaviour in scripts and the shell.
Unfortunately, no. Python 4.0 is happening. It's the version after 3.9. I wish I was joking about this.

Guido personally disliked the idea of a `x.10` release. It is no longer up to Guido so I would say that's far from a done deal.
&gt; Clearly 4.0 should have a major, breaking feature. dynamite_monkey.jpg
Not only can you, you should.
Why not just have e the program render a JPEG of it's state? Then you can stitch them together as fast as you can render
Dang, thanks for the info I hope one day I cab reach this level of understanding with computers
&gt; Static type hinting I'm confused by this whole point. The core team had repeatedly said that type hints will never be mandatory and the interpreter will never do anything with them other than making them available at run time. I'd like to see better support for generics, optionals and unions because interacting with them now kind of sucks and requires all sorts of knowing internals of the type system that are prone to breaking version to version. If you want real breaking changes, let's start looking at things like C# attributes. That's not something that ever happen but would be extraordinarily useful.
I copied your code and tried to run it and it doesn't seem to work. What am I doing wrong? Here is the error I'm getting. &amp;#x200B; Traceback (most recent call last): File "[redditpython.py](https://redditpython.py)", line 2, in &lt;module&gt; import urllib2 ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'urllib2'
Since PHP is pretty much exclusively for web development maybe it's just assumed?
A coworker looked at it this morning and noted that their privacy policy was ambiguous about whether they send your code to their servers so they not have actually changed that part...
Talk to me when the PTSD from the 2-&gt;3 changeover is complete. In, oh, 2030 or so.
4.0 should have parallel processing primitives that aren't total crap, for all it's uses trying to get multi-core speed is a painful task for non-trivial workloads that need a shared-memory model.
The idea of making python 4.0 after 3.9 is just silly without a breaking feature. Guido can be wrong, and it's no longer his ultimate decision anyway
I'd like something like the `Parallel.ForEach`, `Parallel.Invoke` etc of C#. It can be done in Python of course. But a native construct for that would be nice.
 if you or anyone else is interested I am trying to start up a "favor" exchange subreddit. Mine will be more hands off, but hope to make it a place where people can post for help. Please feel welcome to subscribe guys its just in the baby stages: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Favor\_Favour\_Exchange/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Favor_Favour_Exchange/) &amp;#x200B;
How about fixing the stdlib to conform to pep-8? I’m looking at you logging and unittest.
The biggest thing that makes me switch from using Python to Go or Nim or other options is when speed is paramount. Julia compiling to LLVM makes it so fast. I'd be willing to forego any new features for a few versions - after asyncio I'm good, really. I'd rather we focus solely on the performance of CPython. GIL or not, performance is Python's Achilles heel, and I hate to see that turn people away just as Python is finally hitting its stride.
&gt; And maybe release manylinux2010 before CentOS 6 goes dark like CentOS 5 already has https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/news/ manylinux2010 support is in pip 19.
Why is this a problem? (Python predates semver by like a decade)
What's the assignment? 
Yes, but the manylinux2010 Docker image isn't ready so it isn't possible to build wheels. CentOS 6 is already end of life and there will be no more patches by late 2019 or early 2020. CentOS 6 also doesn't support C++14 so all C++ projects are held back to C++11.
Just put your code from answer one inside a while true block
To make the program run automatically you should use a while loop while(): *code*
Make use of some existing APIs, then you just need to make basic HTTP requests do something fancy looking. Like you pull stock data from one API, then alert to slack via another when a certain condition is spotted.
This is what I have so far for number 1 Z = float Z = input ( ' enter a number ' ) Print(and(float(z)))
Have you tried \`numba\`? Really easy to use. Write a python function with simple looping syntax, stick an \`@jit\` decorator on it, and bam, C-like performance.
What version python are you using? It looks like you don't have the urrlib2 module installed.
Not sure what their point is about type hints? That's already in the language (3.5 or 3.6, can't remember). I agree that tooling to make JIT easier would be great for the language and the `numba` project has been excellent on this so far. One thing I'd love to see would be a nicer syntax for multi-line anonymous functions. Sure I think there's a way to hack this with `lambda` but it looks ugly if I recall correctly.
Im using Python 3.7.2
Yeah, I'm also confused by the type hint point. If the author is saying "I want optional type hinting" it exists. If the author was saying they want compulsory type hints, then they're probably ~a crack addict~ not going to ever get that in python. 
Hello, the first thing Iearnt with python was PyQt. I recommend zetcode.com for good tutorials on it. As for Matplotlib, you need to understand there are three ways of using it. Most examples and tutorials mix all three. [https://matplotlib.org/faq/usage_faq.html](https://matplotlib.org/faq/usage_faq.html) The official documents are good as long as you know where to begin. But if you're looking for a modern plotting instrument, I recommend plotly and dash. They're great.
I have z = float z = input( ' enter a number ' ) Print(abs(float(z)))
while True: userInput = input(“Enter a number”) If userInput == “q”: break print(abs(float(userInput)))
That's exactly what it should be doing, so if it isn't, something is wrong.
Sounds like you're a person who wants to /r/learnpython
Thanks

I just want a goddamn `switch` statement.

Where does pycharm come into this?
Yeah I think it's WSL since it's working properly in Ubuntu. Thank you.
Check [this stackoverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37695939/maximum-file-size-in-pycharm)
A cool breaking change that it’s probably impossible without getting microsoft involved is Built-in support to execute python code as executables without need of pyinstaller or stuff like that. That would make deployment a lot easier at least on windows (and deployment is right now the hardest thing if you develop desktop applications). Another possible change would be the abbility to integrate python code in websites like javascript does. I mean using python on the frontend website, not as the backend server, to display and generate websites and stuff. 
The limit is from PyCharm.
Cheers!
There's an upvote button which serves the same purpose as your comment 
I would see GPU support working like async/await, where the basic feature is added to the language, and then a bunch of libraries can take advantage of it to build useful libraries. Lack of GPU support is the one answer I have to the question of why someone would use Matlab over Python.
My code was made using Python 2.7 so it looks like it's just an issue with importing that module. Here is a link to the [solution](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2792650/import-error-no-module-name-urllib2) for this on stack overflow. After you resolve that issue the code should be fine. Good luck!
We'll, if we're talking about parallelism on a version bump that ought to have a breaking change, let's drop the GIL and substitute in locking primitives. (Yeah, I know the GIL isn't a major performance problem with most workloads. But it implies a major semantic that makes some kinds of optimizations infeasible.)
I would love pointers. Would help me a lot sometimes😂
Your post said you're running a python script and directing the output to a text file. How can pycharm *possibly* be reaching into your terminal session to limit the size of a file, when there's no reason for it to know about either the file, or the process, or even be running? Maybe you're running the command through a terminal emulator within pycharm. Maybe some other aspect of your question is incorrect. Nobody will be able to help you until you clarify what is actually going on, and nobody *should* help you if that doesn't occur to you, and you refuse to expound upon it when asked. So I'll ask again. Where does pycharm come into this?
KILL IT WITH FIRE
How about pattern matching instead? https://gist.github.com/raiderrobert/cbacb4c69860ef2eba84020503c01440
https://github.com/pypa/manylinux/issues/179 It's almost here. There are three open PRs from the looks of it. Also, many of the changes that went into manylinux2010 will make it easier to roll out a manylinux2014 (CentOS 7 and up).
I would have gone with a 1.44Mb size limit. Because if your source file won't fit on a floppy you're probably doing something wrong.

I’m currently using python 3.7 and I created a simple MD5 converter to expand my knowledge in python as I’m pretty new. So I was testing the waters and converted a picture instead of something like a regular txt file. I think I’m converting a picture into MD5? I’m curious what all of these characters are representing . I’m fairly new and any help would be appreciated!! 
“...and boy are my arms tired!”
Thank you very much! It's appreciated. As for PyQT, I have successfully made GUIs in it and it's very straightforward, but it took me a few attempts! Thanks for the matplotlib stuff, I'll be sure to check it out!

I thought he changed his mind about this?
Why? use a dict
I'm pretty sure it's similar to what happens when you try to view a .exe file. Don't quote me but I'm pretty sure it's a form of encryption by the computer. 
It's a computer.
The only real breaking change I’d like to see is doing away with indentation to define code blocks!!!!! If there is one thing about Python that sucks it is this! Even if it became optional, code blocks delimitnated by begin and end characters / symbols would be of immense help. 
Each ASCII character (a,b,c....and pretty much any other character/symbol you can think of) are essentially a set of binary (10010101). That terminal takes the binary and concerts it into ASCII. Now what I think you made is a binary file that is your md5. So the terminal is taking those 1s and 0s and converting them into their associated characters. But because that's not what the binary wasn't written to be converted into ASCII all the characters are mismatched and jumbled into the gibberish you see. Hopefully that makes sense. 
Don't forget leg day. 
I’d fucking lose my job if I had to do 1 pull up anytime I had to visit stack overflow.
Yeah it does make a lot of sense, thanks for the help!!
Hi, I'm new to coding in general and Python in particular. Just started learning this week. I'm working on a little script that calculates prime numbers. 
I spend more time at stackoverflow than my home.
What are your interests? Python can do a lot of things, so it’s somewhat difficult to come up with a suggestion in the abstract.

OP means the limit pycharm has when opening files in the IDE, the default value is what OP put in the post. &amp;#x200B; not sure where you got the idea that it was a terminal issue / python issue
Is Python easy to distribute as a standalone package on any platform? Saying Windows specifically makes it sound like it's totally fine everywhere else.
Hey its Python. Do some research on AI, create Skynet and rule the world with your digital brethren.
Because that's what OP said. &gt; new files created with the command "twitter_streaming.py &gt; twitter_data.txt" have a file size limit of 2.44Mb. states that the method of creation of the file is relevant to the limit, and that the limit is on the actual size of the file. &gt; should I just create a new file in the program then write/append the results into the file instead This also does not suggest that it's a reading-files-with-pycharm problem, but something to do with the file creation and population. OP's explanation of the issue had nothing to do with pycharm, so I asked how pycharm was involved, and OP basically replied "because pycharm is involved", which is obviously not helpful.
I want to learn how to make stuff like this in the future. How can I get to this point? I have taken Harvard CS50x, and Automate the Boring Stuff so far.. 
What do the axes represent in the first three plots? Is it supposed to be obvious and I'm just dumb? I can guess what I'm looking at with the last plot, but axis labels and a legend would probably be helpful, along with a title like "population vs time" (I'm assuming).
We already have multiprocessing map
We use Flask but we don’t list it in the job post because it doesn’t matter to us if you’ve used it or not in the past. It’s likely that many jobs you’re looking at just don’t list it.
I wish stack overflow could help with the type of shit I deal with at work.
1: read the sidebar 2: post things like this in /r/learnpython 3: don't post screenshots 4: show your code 5: we won't do your homework for you 6: don't be lazy
 &gt; git pull up fatal: 'up' does not appear to be a git repository 
Aliases though, don't force people to change names in old code. While they're at it, make assert a proper function.
I don't know. I only use Windows so I wouldn't dare to give an opinnion for other systems when I have no clue about it.
No problem, thanks - you just got me excited is all.
3.10 = 3.1
They're not always different - it's relatively rare, in fact. Beautiful soup is indeed an irritatingly popular example, but what about the name Beautiful Soup screams "these package maintainers have a good head for ergonomic naming"?

Because that's messy as fuck and doesn't emulate a true `switch`.
You don't seem to know what `switch` does if you're suggesting using a dict (?)
You can sort of use a dict like a switch. But is is [hacky](https://jaxenter.com/implement-switch-case-statement-python-138315.html)

I would suggest to subscribe to: r/python r/learnpython r/pythontips r/pythoncoding For tutorial/articles checkout https://realpython.com https://dev.to/t/python For video tutorials checkout https://m.youtube.com/user/sentdex I’m sure there’s a lot more! Any other suggestions?!

Or maybe some "push" ups? Git push
*It's a shame that there isn't a SOF for writing jokes...* ;)
Right on! 🤣
I did the same 2 years ago and I was doing 10 pull ups + 10 push ups and now I am competing for Mr. Galaxy

There are lots of tools that do this, some enterprise focused others open source. Have a look at airflow or Luigi

Your assumption is correct, just read up on beautifulsoup and look at some repos with examples, it's a pretty easy library 
Thank you very much!

Reddit and the projects I care about. I read release notes.
I'd love to see more immutable variables. If, for instance, a variable / object is created with `let`, it should be immutable: let lst = [1, 2, 3] lst.append(4) # error, lst cannot be modified 
It's a problem because `python3` will launch Python 4.0 and that is stupid.
Oh, I just learnt that it is implementation specific. I will find out more about that. Yes, I think I should have stated there is a different behaviour in scripts and the shell. I know the behaviour is different. I will update the ariticle appropriately. Thanks. 
Yeah. Thanks
read the sidebar.
Most standard containers have an immutable counterpart, the exception being dictionaries. In your example you could simply replace the list by a tuple.

Thanks for asking! What I meant is that it's my job to design and analyze propulsion systems, not to develop software. The Apollo program is an inspiration to everyone in my industry. The fact that we made historic accomplishments with such limited technology is encouraging when we face technology challenges today. Today we run a complex model and say "we can't risk flying this rocket, the model says it's unsafe - the probability of failure based on everything we know and our risk acceptance threshold is too high..." and yet Apollo reminds us that it's not the analysis model that lands on the moon and that there is a balance between making perfect all our models, predictions, codes, and paperwork, and getting actual hardware in the air. For me, software is a tool that helps me do my actual job of propulsion analysis work. The quality of my scripts / codes / software is entirely my choice and if I treated my code like flight software or even like professional software and did everything that is expected or a "best practice" I would be told to cut it out and get back to work. If we really need a high quality software project, then my boss would want me to write a statement of work and hire someone to execute it, rather than have his aerospace engineer "wasting" 90% of his time writing tests, documentation, build scripts, and commit messages that no one asked for. So I'm always pulled between 2 worlds. On a good days it's great because I get to combine things I love and that compliment each other beautifully (coding and rocket science), but sometimes I'm stuck doing paperwork for 3 months and then I come back to my code that I left mid-thought months ago. I have an afternoon to answer a question ("what's the max thrust if I change this parameter?") and there's obviously not time to refactor or document or write tests - I whip up a script, get an answer and move on. Is my answer right? Does my script have bugs? Can I rely on my software? I don't know. I know I'm doing these things better than others on my team or in my department. I expose my co-workers to Python and to concepts like version control all the time to show them how computer scientists have solved the problems they are having with their messy mountain of Matlab scripts. Bit, no, 
Thank you for the highlights. I am trying to understand the process that needs to be taken after I have a model (a recommendation model). When we have a recommendation model we expect that each user when opens his app/web will see recommended items based on his history and previous interaction in the platform. **The question is this being implemented.** &amp;#x200B; 1- Do we generate the recommendation live right when the user opens his app/web page? 2- Do we build recommendations for each user (say 10 recommended items) and store them in a database. Items are fed into the user when he opens the application? &amp;#x200B;
Why is numpy not in the standard library?
My bad, from mobile phone it looked like you insert only once at the end. I think you can try to add log or print statement right after insert and commit. If it is MySQL with InnoDB engine database rows should appear just after commit. So maybe problem in some other place. also you can get a bit more speed if choosing bufsize=1: &amp;#x200B; `bufsize, if given, has the same meaning as the corresponding argument to the built-in open() function: 0` `means unbuffered, 1 means line buffered, any other positive value means use a buffer of (approximately) that size.` So if you have email per line it will be better choice. In case of constant buffer you may wait for next chank even if you get a part of current line. Also you shouldn't commit after reading a line. Better choice is to do commit only after insert (because empty commit do nothing, but have some perfomance impact) Snipped you've provided have many skips of logic. So it may have some other perfomance issues. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
Correct me if Im wrong but doesnt GIL essentially prevent parallelism in the sense that each Python process and all its threads can only run on a single core?
Thank you 
If you aren't working in datascience you use numpy exactly 0 times. It's a big complicated package used by a (seemingly big) minority of users.
Add `-f` for respects.
I somehow agree.... Good point!
Standing desk up, standing desk down.
1) This is not True. 2) More and more people cannot avoid working in data science (or related areas like ML) anymore. If you visit any computer science conference, you'll be amazed that more than every second paper is about or heavily relies on machine learning and data science. It's the majority nowadays...

The argument was for people not working in data science. Numpy is useful for people in data science. How do people outside of data science use it?

The 'best' choice depends to a large extent on the expectations of your users - Users expect pages to load quickly, they seldom want to wait for several seconds when they open a page =&gt; if generating a prediction takes some time, then 'live recommendation' may not be a suitable approach - On the other hand, users may expect that their actions have an immediate effect on the recommendations they get =&gt; if this is the case, then 'batch recommendations' (you're second option) are less suited And of course, a typical user, when asked, wants both ;) So when you ask your users what they want, also ask them which one of the two they find most important. Another thing you may look at is if incorporating the latest user actions into the recommendation you're making really adds value to that recommendation (i.e. would it change significantly what is being recommended...). Assuming users want quick pages and latest user actions have significant impact on generated recommendation, then look into how you could 'split up' the recommendation generating process into a 'batch' and a 'live' part. - 'batch' part would e.g. run every day (or every hour or every ...), process all user actions and store base recommendations in a database. - 'live' part would take those stored recommendations, add the latest user actions into the mix and generate 'live' recommendation on the fly. 
For me as a short coder, the review of each language is as below: &amp;#x200B; C：Fun &amp;#x200B; C++：Use the most, but too long &amp;#x200B; Lisp：not short &amp;#x200B; Haskell: not short, but fun &amp;#x200B; Pascal：Fast IO &amp;#x200B; Perl：Short！ &amp;#x200B; PHP：Not short &amp;#x200B; Python Not short &amp;#x200B; Ruby：短くする技量がない &amp;#x200B; Rust：More than 450Byte in IO template &amp;#x200B; AWK：Short！ &amp;#x200B; Octave：Short in same cases &amp;#x200B; Perl6：The best
Cheers on delivering! It seems like a pretty huge run-time overhead, but I'll concede that for many cases it may not be significant. Re 2 and 3, my design philosophy is to allow for every use case, but to optimize for the common use case. But of course, it's your project, not mine :) (PyContracts isn't really my speed)
I use grid engine on the linux server to manage jobs include python script, but it's not free. Other program such as slurm or hadoop may help you. It's not a matter of python, so you may ask in Linux board. 
There is also the [pyrsistent](https://github.com/tobgu/pyrsistent) project that provides immutable data structures. I wouldn't mind if they were somehow integrated in Python 4. If Python added more support to FP, that would be cool IMO. With `let`, I would like to have something like this too: let x = 2 x = 5 # error, x cannot be changed

The standard library is where packages go to die. Good luck changing things. You are also forced into a specific release schedule. Also, because they don’t want to be.
Without knowing the package history, I'd imagine that beautiful soup is a reference to tag soup which an average HTML page is, and that they somehow implied that they make it "beautiful". I also kind of like how, when abbreviate it, basically, tells you that it's bullshit. Though, I'm not sure they intended for it to be that way. That's not to say that I'm particularly fond of this package, or that there is this kind of mismatch between package names and module names (which are also package names, depends on who you ask). To OP: it gets worse. Depending on what format you use for packaging and how bad your packaging tools are, you can even stuff multiple top-level packages into your packages. Wait, you can even stuff the same package into multiple differently named distribution packages. Needless to say all of this gunk will be called "packages", because, they thought about how comfortable it will be to read the documentation, when they wrote it... wait, they didn't really, but nevermind that.
MATLAB’s biggest strength is it’s Simulink toolbox. Python has nothing popular/robust/graphical like it. Numbs can make use of the GPU if you really want it.
This is hilarious on multiple counts. But, a true story first. Once when people were still reading MDN, a newbie posted a question there: for the purpose of learning how to use MSVS, and, specifically, it's WindowsForms designer, the poor soul decided to reimplement minesweeper. His question was basically this: &gt; I put 5000 buttons on a form, and the program slowed to a grinding halt, how can I speed it up? Well, let me start first by stating that a decent editor shouldn't have a problem opening a file of any size. If you are struggling / don't have a way to do that, you failed at making an editor. For example, notepad.exe is a failure, because it will just hang forever opening large files. PyCharm is the same kind of failure as notepad.exe. But, it's really hard to deal with big files in an editor, so, typically editors have built in some functionality to handle that. The general means of dealing with very big files are called "pagers". Some very simple examples of pagers are `less` and `more`. Some programs will automatically display their output in a pager to the general annoyance of the audience, eg. `git`, `systemctl`, `journalctl` and a lot of others need to be configured to not use pagers... So, what do decent editors do, when they encounter big files (by the way, 2.5 MB is really tiny! Even archaic filesystems like ext4 support files up to 16 TB -- that's about eight billion times bigger than the limit imposed on you by your crappy editor)? Well, Emacs has a mode for this: https://github.com/m00natic/vlfi , I imagine Vim has something like that too. But, even w/o that kind of trickery, you should be fine on a modern computer when opening files several gigabytes big, in a decent editor that is.
Your project is so simple and you may use bash. (wget and grep) &amp;#x200B;

Try aggregating bunches of emails? Batch inserts are usually faster, but there's no saying who's the weak link here, maybe it's not the inserts, but it's easy to isolate this: just profile the insertion by itself, removing Python from equation. You could also remove any database-related stuff from your Python code and time it to see how often would it try to query the database. One thing I can say is that reading line-by-line is actually slow in Python, because, essentially, it will look into each character trying to establish whether that's a newline character or not, and then allocate a new string with the substring from the buffer it's reading from. If all you need to do is to search for a specific pattern, maybe getting direct access to the buffer you read from is a better idea. Finally, you don't really have to use `subprocess` for this, it's probably better if you don't. Just remember the offset at the end of the file you were reading from, and next time you open the file, do a `seek()` to that offset. That would be essentially doing what `tail` does anyways, but, in your case, you are forearmed with knowledge that the log grows quickly, so you don't need to wait for the system to notify you about changes, you can tell for sure there were changes.
Haha, had a good chuckle, thanks :)
Ruby is the only programming language developed in Japan and many documents are written in Japanese, so You should learn Japanese when you learn ruby. 
multiprocessing is separate processes ( aka, non-shared-memory ). All variable synchronization has to be done over a pipe. Multithreading is better, but we are prevented by the GIL from sharing objects in any meaningful way.
Python's stated goal from the beginning was that single-threaded workloads were the primary goal and the locking/GC was designed to achieve that goal with the total lack of decent shared memory and multi-core primitives.
Correct, so even the multiprocessing module is actually creating multiple python interpreters which are loosely coupled with pipes and send variable back and forth by pickling and marshaling calls.
It would only receive updates every 18 months.
