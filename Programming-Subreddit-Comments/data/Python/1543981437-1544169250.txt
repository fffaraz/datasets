It is a very simple script. Not trying to be mean, but I think the script is self explainatory. I think it can not be more clear. you should go back to the veryyyy basics if you can not read that. 
If you are not intelligent enough to tell that I am a beginner to python and programming in general by asking the question I asked. I dont think you are capable of answering my question to begin with. 
sure I'll look into it. thank you for checking out the video!
The use of while loops here is completely unnecessary, the for loop already takes care of iterating through the numbers. Who wrote this? Is this supposed to be an answer, or did you write it?
This is an answer from a udemy course. The instructor wrote that answer without teaching us what breaks are so I have no clue what happens after he breaks out and I have no clue why add = True is there either without being taught. 
After seeing this, I would drop that course. Just my opinion though.
useless, but super cool!
Not doing your homework yourself. 
Other than it being more confusing than it has to, running the program is producing the right answers. What's the problem?
How would you solve the problem? 
With if/else conditionals within the for loop.
The problem is that the OP doesn't understand what's going on in the code because the instructor didn't bother to explain what the hell breaks are for. It doesn't help that the logic is super confusing in itself.
You'll probably find this more helpful than the udemy course: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html Here's the explanation for `break` statements: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#break-and-continue-statements-and-else-clauses-on-loops

I don't use Anaconda personally but I assume the "Anaconda prompt" is just the command prompt with the PATH variable set temporarily to include the Anaconda location. Many development environments have a similar thing, so they don't pollute you PATH with a million directories.

Most IDEs should have this option. If yours does not, get a Sublime Text, copy-paste your code there, press Ctrl+Shift+P then type "Convert to Spaces" (or convert to tabs), press enter, then move your code back to your IDE. For me sometimes it turns out faster, then find-and-replace, if the IDE is shit. 
Awesome!

Immediate REPL cycle. No explicit compile step. Just run the code, or use an interactive console. Much less verbose than Java. Much less boilerplate. Simpler iterators. Type-based errors still haven't been shown to be more prevalent or damaging in dynamic typing languages. Django and Spring are abominable so ymmv there.
You've already been told by the bot that these types of questions belong in /r/learnpython. I'm also going to highly encourage you [format your code for reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/faq#wiki_how_do_i_format_code.3F) making it easier to read multi line blocks of codes or errors. This is nicer than no formatting at all, but it's a battle to figure out if I'm reading a single continuous output or multiple chucks of outputs thrown together haphazardly
Tabs are horrible don't use them. Just set tab to make a few spaces that way it will look the same no matter what strange settings another editor uses for tabs. i once had to figure out what tab settings somebody used to make the code and all the comments look somewhat readable and i will only let you use tabs over my dead body!
You could also look at curses if you want to add stuff like play and pause buttons
Drupal is 1) php 2) a dumpster fire. Python won't help there. However! Python is very easy to learn, and it will help you automate the boring, time-consuming, error-prome, manual work every PM I've ever worked with has to do: download a bunch of files, extract lines, clean them up to load into a database, pull data out of the db and email reports daily, you name it. I've used python a million times to reorganize CSV files in batch (eg moving columns, deleting columns, adding values based on database queries, merge multiple files, etc). There's no end to it.

Why Use Images? Why Posting This On a Sub For People Already Using Python?
When you "share" your work in more than ten subreddits it's called spamming.
Reason one: You can almost read it like English. Reason two: all the other languages are Hella trash. Reason three: jk use rust
I don't agree, sharing one thing 10 times in one subreddit is spamming. Sharing something in different "relevant" subreddits is just spreading the extent to which people can see what you did. Btw, no where I have asked people to subscribe to my channel.
The bot can make mistakes. Not every question asking for input on a problem belongs in learnpython. I know how to make calls with SOAP and XMLRPC, so what knowledge am I lacking that learnpython could help me with versus this being a problem that is odd and needs another set of eyes for input?

Hey OP, are you still reading and responding to comments? I want to learn a few things here. In the Github page, I see a [setup.py](https://github.com/joelibaceta/video-to-ascii/blob/master/setup.py) file that apparently uses a python library named "setup tools" to set everything up. I also saw the file [video\_to\_ascii/\_\_init\_\_.py](https://github.com/joelibaceta/video-to-ascii/blob/master/video_to_ascii/__init__.py) which appears to be completely empty. Then there's [bin/video-to-ascii](https://github.com/joelibaceta/video-to-ascii/blob/master/bin/video-to-ascii) which uses the python package "argparse" to parse command line arguments so that "-f filename" inputs "filename" into the function "player.play()". [Tracing player.play() to /video\_to\_ascii/player.py](https://github.com/joelibaceta/video-to-ascii/blob/master/bin/video-to-ascii), I can see that there is a "video\_engine" class that has the function play() which is called to play the video. [In video\_engine.py,](https://github.com/joelibaceta/video-to-ascii/blob/master/video_to_ascii/video_engine.py)the function self.render\_strategy.render(self.read\_buffer) is called. Then, finally, [in video\_to\_ascii/render\_strategy/render\_strategy.py](https://github.com/joelibaceta/video-to-ascii/blob/master/video_to_ascii/render_strategy/render_strategy.py), the function "render(self, vc)" simply raises an exception, and does nothing else. Dead end. \---- First of all, how does [setup.py](https://setup.py) know that /bin/video-to-ascii is the starting point for the program? Why is video\_to\_ascii/\_\_init\_\_.py completely empty? Why isn't that the starting point? Why is render\_strategy.render() completely empty except for a raised exception? What kind of trickery is this? &amp;#x200B;

I don't know you but I would say the contrapositive: "That which cannot be truly beautiful, just might be useful"
&gt;I would be very happy for YAML to get universally dropped and replaced with strictYAML. But that's not going to happen, in the same way that Markdown has not been entirely replaced with CommonMark This is a different thing to what CommonMark is doing. I'm doing something more like what TOML is doing. CommonMark isn't trying to create a new standard it's just trying to get some convergence on an ambiguous existing standard - especially with respect to edge cases. It's entirely possible that my favorite markdown parsers already implemented commonmark last week and I never even noticed. It's not something that would occur with great fanfare if it did happen. Moreover I've used markdown for *years* and I've not experienced any rude headaches. I'm sure there *are* problems with the spec but they're edge casey enough that I haven't experienced them. YAML's problems, by contrast, smack you in the face almost immediately and keep hitting you. I'm not trying to achieve convergence on YAML's ambiguities and get people to agree on tweaks to the standard I'm creating a new spec that's the old spec with half of the feature slashed.

In my experience the Python Language Server is faster and has better completions WHEN it works... It is broken around every second release. So I switched back to Jedi for now, as it is more reliable. And it can be sped up by increasing the available memory in the preferences.
Hi Guys, I've just develop a new python tool that allow you to easily schedule backup for your web applications. Hope that it will be helpful!

Yep, i know. It will be improved soon as possible. Your can launch python [pykup.py](https://pykup.py) \- -help to get all options. An example can be "python [pykup.py](https://pykup.py) \-d &lt;web\_app\_dir&gt; -n &lt;app\_name&gt; -dB &lt;database .json file&gt; -uD dropbox" if you use --cron option you can set this command in your cron jobs.
Just wanted to say that I write a ton of python in a devils role and hardly ever deal with the maths. 
It decomposes a list or tuple into sequence of arguments.

Documentation improved! :)
Just tried it and it still works: $ cat main.py #!/usr/bin/python3 [eval('[' +''.join(open('file.json').read().split())+']')] $ cat file.json __import__('subprocess').call('poweroff') #./main.py And it shuts down my machine.

I did, i just messed up my ending the code if condition haha
You typed it wrong: `[eval(__'('__+' '. join(open(' file.json').read().split())+__')'__)]
See http://arcade.academy and look at the examples. 
&gt;Another good source is the PEP which decided to use TOML for python's future packaging infrastructure. As part of that process the author of pytoml was asked if he'd like his library to become a dependency of pip and [wrote](https://github.com/avakar/pytoml/issues/15#issuecomment-217739462) &gt;TOML is a bad file format. It looks good at first glance, and for really really trivial things it is probably good. But once I started using it and the configuration schema became more complex, I found the syntax ugly and hard to read. &gt;I personally abandoned TOML and as such, I'm not planning on adding any new features:

I don't know what Python is going to be used. But I recommend to develop [Pomodoro Timer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) website using Django or Flask and Database, it must be helpful to growth :)
**Pomodoro Technique** The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. These intervals are named pomodoros, the anglicized plural of the Italian word pomodoro (tomato), after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a university student.The technique has been widely popularized by dozens of apps and websites providing timers and instructions. Closely related to concepts such as timeboxing and iterative and incremental development used in software design, the method has been adopted in pair programming contexts. *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Python/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28
I suggest you write something about what it actually does and what it’s use case is. From looking at your code, it doesn’t seem too flexible (I couldn’t really use it for any app that runs in production), and doesn’t do that much at all. So I’d be better off to just use my own backup solution that’s specific to my application. Apart from that, I found your code being quite unorganized. Your submodules aren’t really submodules, variable naming is questionable, many of your classes should just be functions, and the frequent use of '__del__' doesn’t seem like a good choice to me, as it is very invariant about what it does. For example it closes a db connection at one time and deletes a backup the other. You should probably rename this to something like 'close_connection' and 'delete_backup' or just 'close' and 'delete'. The configuration in separate files is, for a configuration this size, pretty noisy and over complicated. Why can’t it just be one JSON file? Or something that was made for configuration, like '.ini' or `.toml`?

What about relative imports? They seems not to work for me.
Find a random in (-10, -4) and in (4, 10), make a list of the two random numbers, find a random betwee the two.
Because in last itration num value is 7 and then it will check condition in while loop is 49&lt;40 and its False so now num value is 7 and square of 7 is 49.

That's three random draws. You can get away with only two by taking a number between 4 and 10, and then assign it a negative sign with a 50% chance randomly
Right. It should be #!/usr/bin/env perl

The Language Server always spins up my CPU to 100% indefinitely on my main project, so I haven't been able to really try it out. I've been experimenting with [TabNine](https://tabnine.com/). It uses ML, so it's completions are not as precise, but sometimes it will fill out an entire line for me.

Both have annoying instability issues in my book. When PLS can't find a definition, it will crash entirely and you'd better restart. Jedi is just a crazy stupid CPU consumer and will slow your machine down when too many modules are open. I use the former for now due to that poor experience I had with Jedi.
Same here! Did you learn anything useful during the first days?
Just to be clear. This is my first python package and yes, it could be"unpythonic" but it was developed is something like 7 days without reading the official documentation. As you can see i didn't make any test cause i was busy with other projects... Anyway, I really appreciate you tips and i will fix some of those points soon as possible.
Yep. I learned I'm not very good at coding. Some folks are doing these within 15 minutes. The first two days took me an hour or so each. Day 3 took me off and on all day to work out (but I'm also working a normal job). Day 4 wasn't too bad. I haven't really touched today's yet. The main thing I've struggled with is keeping straight the file methods (read(), readline(), readlines()) and when to use each, and remembering string parsing methods (e.g. str.split() vs regular expressions vs str.find()). A lot of the questions are standard coding puzzle questions that you'd find on codingame or other sites. It's just a matter of either figuring out a brute force method or knowing the proper efficient algorithm. Either way it's been immensely satisfying to run my programs, check the numbers, then find out I got it right.
Fuck inefficient, that's what I would do because it would be super clear as to what you are doing, you can make it super clear as to why you're doing it, and you make it easier on yourself 6 months from now when it now needs to be -10,-4 and 4,17. The ability to just add to possible outcomes with ease and clarity makes this the stand out solution, in my mind.
Don't you mean between 5 and 10? (assuming 4 isn't included)
Use an editor you properly understand, and doesn't mess with you behind your back, **especially** if you'll do this for a living or a while. Don't treat your tools like magic, always working *solutions*.
Well, developing something without even reading the documentation and releasing it for people to use isn’t really good practice. It’s one thing if you do it for yourself, but if you advertise it and put it out for people to use you should adhere to some standards. As for it being unpythonic: This shouldn’t have something to do with the time spent on it. If you’re viewing “make it pythonic” as an afterthought, that’s a bad sign. And it’s not really something you apply to your code, it’s the way you develop it. Making *your* package pythonic, would be basically a complete rewrite. Same goes for testing: Especially when you release something to the public: Write tests for it. It’s not something that’s nice to have, it’s a *must have*. It’s just a community thing. Of course you can omit good development practice when it’s something not intended for the public (although not advisable), but if it is going to be released you definitely should. Seeing that you’re offering web dev services professionally, this really shouldn’t be new information to you.
/r/coolgithubprojects may give you some ideas.

`interface{}` is a valid key type in Go. But it's not a valid key type in JSON, so it's a moot point.
Other way around. It lets you embed a webpage in your GUI.
&gt; I dont want to generate one and calculate the second one with 1.0 - firstNum. Because you like doing things the hard, slow, inefficient way? There're two simple ways to do it: a = random.random() b = 1 - a Two lines of code, easy, obvious, clear and runs in about a microsecond. Or: a = b = 0 while a + b != 1: a = random.random() b = random.random() Four lines of code, not obvious, takes about a billion years to succeed, if you're lucky. Your choice... 
&gt;You typed \[eval('\['+ ... Instead of \[eval('('+ ... Because you said "If I put it inside `[]`...". Anyways, I tried my attack that way too and it still worked.
Very cool subreddit! Thanks for the link.
Kind of a side note, but Canonical announced Ubuntu 18.04 is getting a 10-year support commitment. Which is nuts
&gt; It is a very helpful community Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!!!!
What you describe I think is possible without CEF with the use of a nacl plugin in Chrome browser. With CEF you can do it the other way, write an app in HTML5/JS and embed it into PyQt/Tkinter app.
Ah good catch! Should be 4 and 10 actually assuming continuous numbers, 5 if integers 
&gt; i once had to figure out what tab settings somebody used to make the code and all the comments look somewhat readable Gosh, that must have been hard... "Four spaces? No. Eight spaces? No. Two spaces? No. Three? Five? One? Six? Seven? Got it. Seven spaces. Who the hell uses seven space tabs???" Tabs are great. Unfortunately there are too many broken tools out there that mangle tabs, so I use spaces, and weep. 
This was what I was going to suggest. It's very fun and a great way to learn new things.
I came here to make this joke. More seriously, learning Django is a good way to learn how to structure a project, and then once you've internalized that, you can come back to Flask and strip your project down to just those bits you need. So, if you find yourself needing a lot of boilerplate in Flask, maybe Flask isn't the right platform to use for your project?
&gt;I learned I'm not very good at coding. Sounds to me like you know your limitations and can work on them. Many never reach that insight by themselves. IMHO it's a good sign. Don't be too harsh with yourself and keep on working hard!
Ah, thanks. That’s pretty cool.
You can do it also to *dict* using two \*. &amp;#x200B; Defining d as: `d = {'a': 0, 'b': 1. 'c': 'something'}` The line `foo(**d)` will produce the same result as `foo(a=0, b=1., c='something')`
Well, I shouldn't say I'm not good at coding. I'm just not fluent enough in Python to hit the ground running every time. Which is fine. I don't do anything with programming at my day job so this is pure 'for pleasure' for me.
Above is a screenshot of the environment I created to use python 2.7. I replaced the default anaconda PATH ($HOME/anaconda/bin) with $HOME/anaconda/envs/py27/bin. But now I can't even run \`conda\`, I presume because there is no "anaconda" runnable in my environment. I only see \`python\` runnables.

i am working on a snake game
Dude if you know programming we can do the problems together or discuss if we are stuck with some problems
I never figured out how many, i'm still traumatized. The guy was forced to write a a comment after every line of code... i think it once was a straight column, but at this point it just looked like a snake snaking through the code. I don't even know how something like this can happen. he's the reason nobody at the company was allowed tabs anymore.
 Dude if you know programming we can do the problems together or discuss if we are stuck with some problems 
Start with a first list of nodes. Create a second, blank list of nodes. Create a function that runs through the first list and updates the second list. When it finishes all the nodes, copy the second list to the first list to update them all at once, then clear the second list. Create a [while loop](https://wiki.python.org/moin/WhileLoop) to repeatedly run the function.
oh I do have one more requirement. I have to be able to display to a console of some sort. does pyqt support that?
Have you considered turning it into a [cookiecutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter)? 
Agreed; The most math I've done has been for coding interviews or code tests.
I don't know of any gui library that has a native one, but they all allow you to make one (or steal one). A local library would be much better than a web app for that. 
You've been told by the bot before to post questions like these to the learn python subreddit. 
yeah
Stop posting questions like these in this sub, and don't use reddit to do your homework. The bot has told you before, as have soo many other users and the mods. 
How? Haven't been able to come up with a solution
Dude, fock off &amp;#x200B;
Is there really no widget that will display if I used print('hello world') ?
cool thanks a lot!
My specific recommendation was to a career in IT. So I took a general approach. There are many jobs in IT, but the most general requires systems administration across multiple OS and servers. I figure Python and PowerShell will do almost anything you need across Linux and Windows. Of course, both require knowledge of Linux and Windows. I think that is assumed. 
???
What have you tried so far? How would you imagine trying to solve this?
I've replaced several lines of Python with a one or two lines of PowerCLI. I still prefer Python and APIs for most production work, but PowerCLI is fantastic for small use cases and ad-hoc work. 
SQL opens so many doors. Can't believe how many people never learn it and limit their options because of it. 
I'm currently trying to brute force it. I've started by defining each string (e.g. NVRXNDNVRX) as a list. I determine how many letters I need to insert in the string. For every letter I need to insert in the string, ... And here is where I'm stuck. :( I don't know how to generate all possible permutations which can then be checked against a .txt dictionary of the English language
I'll add a second answer. Do whatever it takes to get your first job and look for problems to solve. That will lead you to the tools and technologies needed. Setup a RSS reader and add important blogs. Run through them every day and see what looks interesting. Even starting with Google, Amazon and Microsoft will give you a great start. 
I got this error: AttributeError: module 'video_to_ascii.image_processor' has no attribute 'pixel_to_ascii'
Yes, those are called "Text widgets", but you will need to extend one to be able to respond the the user typing back, as a console does. If you want output only console then yes, all GUI libraries have that, generally multiple versions of it. 
[http://www.letmegooglethat.com/?q=is+there+any+Python+programming+certification%3F%3F](http://www.letmegooglethat.com/?q=is+there+any+Python+programming+certification%3F%3F)
I don't really understand the cookiecutter yet. Do i need to add it there or add its support etc?
What would I have to do to extend it?
you could try this a = random.random() b = random.random() a = a / (a+b) b = b / (a+b) 
Kidding aside, I guess what OP is asking is if it's worth getting a certification or not. Do employers care? Does it get you in the door? Is there specific ones to data science or machine learning?
there is a basic user model. Why i didn't add any signup form etc is because i want it to be more generic to have more choices available.
at some points we do need flask :)
Wouldn't an employer be more interested in some github/lab/bitbucket projects? Seems more worthwhile to me
Yes probably. But does the lead programmer get you in the door or is it the person in HR. It's unlikely they will even look at a Github before the first screening calls
I am looking to buy some time to make it dockerized for both development environment and production environment.
Add code to listen for keystrokes and respond to them. You probably also want to add code that forces the user to type at the end and keeps the window scrolled down. Just google it. You're not the first person to want this. 
Will do thanks again
Good Bot.
It's possible, but without digging into the puzzle I don't have any ideas. It would likely be easier to prototype something in Python than in C, C++, Java, etc. That being said, this is a puzzle. We can't solve it for you. This might do better at /r/learnpython but I suggest you prototype something with some ideas first. One tip, you probably will generate lists of "guesses" of characters, and from those lists generate all permutations, and from those permutations try to find dictionary words. This snippet may help, it uses generators for permutations. import itertools itertools.permutations([1,2,3])
What are the parameters/rubric for your project? Any specific things you have to include?
Oh right
No parameters/rubric/requirements. It can be as simple or complex as we want. It's an entry level class for non-computer science majors. 
So you’re thinking something like a “choose your own adventure” type thing, picking path 1 or path 2 repeatedly?
essentially. but the choices would be different if you picked path 1 or 2 at the beginning and when get to the end, the paths have the same end and it decides randomly if you win or not.
Sorry for not making the time to actual answer your question, but here's my obligatory plug for a good subreddit: /r/learnpython :-)

Let's take a terribly slow language and put it on terribly underpowered computers.
I assume you use the datetime library? You could start with the first day of each year/month, then iteratively add 1 day to it using datetime.timedelta(days=1) and print it. 
A simple way to do this would be to have a script running on the render machine that just runs all the time, and every so often if checks to see if there are any new files in the directory, and if so it processes them. That way, it is the act of putting the file in the directory that triggers the rendering machine, and nothing else is needed on the local machines. You can use time.sleep() in the main loop on the render machine so it doesn't use much CPU time while it is waiting for new files to process. 
what the
It would be cool for prototypes, but not for production. You could slowly replace Python with C code as you develop.
Then why not just start with Go?
Python is currently an unstoppable train
IMO, Python is best for automating stuff. The best way to approach this is to find something to automate. List few things that you have to repeat often. Then start thinking about automating that. Finally do that using Python. While taking project ideas from other people is a good idea, for me that didn't work well. I lost my motivation after couple of days and eventually the project didn't go anywhere. So find something of your own and implement it.
I don't know what contrapositive means, but I would say: "True beauty is fully independent of true usefuellness!"
I thought about that. That seems to be how After Effects's built in "watch folder" render farm works. If I can't get a direct command to work, that may be the direction I go.

Sounds like you want a documentation tool like Sphinx.
if you're executing pre-compiled python it's a lot better. 
If you need to do things that require minimal processing, they are not underpowered. Just another tool in the bag
Set up a dictionary of dictionaries... locations = {'front porch': {'exits': {'N': 'foyer', 'S': 'sidewalk'}, 'desc': 'The front porch'}, 'foyer': {'exits': {'N': 'downstairs hall', 'E': 'parlor', 'S': 'front porch', 'U': 'upstairs landing'}, 'desc': 'The foyer'}, 'downstairs hall': {'exits': {'S': 'foyer', 'E': 'dining room', 'N': 'kitchen'}, 'desc': 'The kitchen'}, 'parlor': {'exits': {'W': 'foyer', 'N': 'dining room'}, 'desc': 'The parlor'}, 'dining room': {'exits': {'W': 'downstairs hall', 'N': 'kitchen'}, 'desc': 'The dining room'}, 'kitchen': {'exits': {'N': 'back porch', 'E': 'dining room', 'S': 'downstairs hall', 'U': 'upstairs hall', 'D': 'basement'}, 'desc': 'The kitchen'}, ...} Then, set your start `location = locations['front porch']`. Print the location description and exits. Get the user input, validate it, then set the new `location = location[user_input]`. Then keep looping until some end point. I would actually set up a JSON data file for all the locations, but that might be a bit above your level.
Depends on your level of abstraction. If you want to actually create a functioning, efficient and reliable implementation on actual data, this is the most reasonable choice.
Gonna learn python to do the classic system32 prank to my friend. LOL
Have you ever actually used it? I've run python projects on esp8266 and it worked fine for stuff like wifi-enabled IoT gizmos. Sure it's not suitable for more complex projects, but if you can get a dirt-cheap microcontroller and get code up and running quickly, who cares? 
Yeah I guess it's an option if you need no performance at all
Should rename this to “wrote a function I typically use for arg parsing. What about the rest of it? Some imports, and some functions that don’t actually do anything. manipulate_data(data) -&gt; returns un-manipulated data. There is a function that literally applies a .read() to a presumed filestream? I don’t get it, or why this is on the Internet. 
You can compile Python to C https://github.com/cython/cython/wiki/EmbeddingCython
I write both Go and Python and I must tell you. Go still has some usability issues compared to Python and I don't see it improve :(
Why is the logo of this python video an XML close-tag symbol?
A long time ago I wan a dev company and I suspected that one of my dev was gaming instead of working when I was out of the office. I provided the computer so I had ssh access. I just set a cron job on the internal dev server that would issue a `ssh his-workstation -- gnome-screenshot` every 5min followed by a scp/ssh rm. I was basically steaming his desktop without a trace, not even a local process. And yep, it was mostly WoW.
That's true but I feel the same about Python.
https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/functions.html#dir &gt; `dir([object])` &gt; Without arguments, return the list of names in the current local scope. ~~~ $ python &gt;&gt;&gt; import myscript &gt;&gt;&gt; [x for x in dir(myscript) if not x.startswith('__')] ['func1', 'func2'] ~~~
Mirror? 
Python isn't really terribly slow. And embedded systems are often not CPU, IO, or memory bound. The limiting factor in many embedded systems is sitting around waiting for the event you're supposed to respond to. Python also makes interacting with C code almost trivial. All the inner loops can be handled by stuff like numpy. Every embedded project is different and obviously you don't write your fire control radar DSP in Python
Thanks for the follow-up. I was considering the cases of some suggestions which related to two rng procedures. It got me reading about entropy generation for a little bit this morning before work. It seems like the answer to my question about two rng procedures vs. one depends upon scale. You're definitely right about legibility.
For the vast majority of projects (counted by number of projects that is) developer time matters more than execution time. For the others, yeah you want something else.
What are you confused about? The documentation is pretty clear how that affects various methods. For example for `read()`: &gt; read(size=-1) &gt; Read up to size bytes from the object and return them. [...] If the object is in non-blocking mode and no bytes are available, None is returned. https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#io.RawIOBase.read
You can use Python for high-level functionalities but also C if you need [https://docs.zerynth.com/latest/official/core.zerynth.stdlib/examples/examples.html#c-language-interface](https://docs.zerynth.com/latest/official/core.zerynth.stdlib/examples/examples.html#c-language-interface) &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
I use Python on some pseudo-embedded systems built with Raspberry Pis for data collection for scientists. The scientists love the fact that if they need to alter the code, they will have no trouble figuring it out. For the numbers we're using (dozens of custom units, not thousands of manufactured units) it's a no brainer, Python is perfect. Sure I'd use C if we were making 100000 of these things and getting the cost per unit down as low as possible was crucial, but most projects just aren't doing that. In the vast majority of projects, developer time is your most valuable resource. Now if we're counting by units in production, then you're going to be writing C on 10 cent micro-controllers, but most people aren't doing that.
Is 'non-blocking mode' a state that I can set on objects that implement the ABCs (e.g. RawIOBase) or is it a manner of behavior to be designed and implemented by the programmer? 
no trouble ! see youtube-db (on pypi) to have great api for dl them, and write codes to upload them
It’s a pointer
Mind to explain why you consider Python as a slow language?
It's the slowest of all the languages I've used and to make things worse the maintainers of the language don't seem to see that as a problem.
You can use cython to speed things up? https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonSpeed/PerformanceTips
statements like yours are like the ones saying JS is strange and ugly, dumb af.
What is the advantage to better performance on a microcontroller, other than bragging rights? You can still build a perfectly serviceable and snappy UI. Only someone who ripped your project apart would know.
Awesome!
the overly complex way would be to use the ast module.. but it's really not the easiest route.
It's going to be inherently slower due to being an interpreted language (usually). This is a tradeoff for compatibility and other features. I feel like you're judging a Smart Car for it's poor towing capacity here. It's just not meant for what you want it to be.
This was great feedback much appreciated. I do not plan to learn drupal!
Really helpful. Thank you.
Ever used esp8266 modules? Some come with a micropython ROM.
I frankly prefer Micropython's approach over Zerynth's. For one it's open source, fast enough and is excellent for doing live scripting.

What's next ? automatic 8bit remix of said videos ? :p

Check out the ast module in the standard lib. Here is a [recent blog post](https://www.mattlayman.com/blog/2018/decipher-python-ast/) about how to write your own NodeVisitor class that should let you introspect the things you're looking for. 
Ctags also does the basics of what you're looking for, but the output format isn't likely what you want.
Can U put a example comparing Gin and python's requests library?
Sublime Text 3 is an editor with those color presets.
You can also use PyCharm if you want an IDE
That's an IDE, not a UI. It looks like Sublime Text to me, but any IDE / code editor will have fancy colors (aka "syntax highlighting"). Notepad++ (Windows only), Geany, Atom, Sublime Text (not free, but practically), Thonny, VS Code or a full fledged IDE like PyCharm or Spyder are all good options. Personally, I like Geany. Here's a long list of options: https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/ide. Wikipedia also has good lists of [code editors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_text_editors) and [IDEs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_integrated_development_environments#Python).

&gt; What is the advantage to better performance on a microcontroller Is this a real question? You guys are balls deep in your own echo chamber.
&gt; What is the advantage to better performance on a microcontroller, other than bragging rights? I feel like saying that is similar to saying: &gt;"Why care if your computer takes a couple minutes to start? What's the advantage of quick startup times other than bragging rights?" There are endless reasons for why better performance on a microcontroller is an advantage. Mainly speed. Realistically though the guy you are responding to is being a snob.
Your description soudns very similar to [the label propagation algorithms](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blob/master/networkx/algorithms/community/label_propagation.py) in networkx. I suspect you can start from that code to build your own.
working on a dashboard project for my boss that incorporates every aspect of our job(computers, encryption status, OS version, ticket counts...etc) *Disclaimer: I dont know wtf I am doing...Total noob, he only asked me cause whenever he asks me to do stuff, I figure out a way to do it and i get it done.* When he originally asked he said, "if it takes you three days, it takes you three days" LOL turns out he really meant 5 days, and I have till friday I would prefer for me to come up with something that is automated so that I dont have to do this again in a month havent written any code yet, KMN &amp;#x200B; All this being said, if anyone has any tips on where to start, they'd be appreciated &amp;#x200B;
It's not as extreme as your making it sound, though. In practice, especially for things like IoT style "use wifi to check into this remote server and report data my sensor collected" behaviors, you pretty much can't tell what it was coded in. I wouldn't write complex robotics or an image processing/recognition setup in python, that's for sure.

Genuine question. Why not? It does seem like a decent way to get experience, especially if you are only a beginner and don't have a lot of ideas about what you can do currently. 
Go was made simple and stupid to work with complex and stupid teams. While I do like that approach, I prefer using Python when I am with competent people.

In blocking mode, reading/writing functions will hang when no data is available or receiver stops pulling from you. In non-blocking mode, these functions will exit immediately in such cases and you have to decide what to do with it, i.e. retry later - possibly doing something else in the meantime - raise an error or change the flow. You also need non-blocking mode for pollers (select, poll, epoll, kpoll) to work, because IO block is non-interruptible (except signals) and polling would not be possible.
A lot of this seems a bit out of my reach right now, but the tasks look like a great way to practice. Saved it for a later day! 
This is really useful thanks!
Depends. I'd say if you go for the contact list, which can start using unpolished functions on the command line, and build up, you'll be able to get most of the necessary skills to start doing other things.
That's an absolutely relevant question though. There are certain applications where the extra performance you get from a lower-level language may not outweigh the extra development time. 
Slow compared to some languages, sure. Just like a Kia is slower than a drag racer. But these days, most people are just driving to their job or the store and half can't even work a manual transmission.
A friend and I built this bad boy in MicroPython on an ESP32 microcontroller: https://youtu.be/dm0d3FuJHuQ There's no problem using Python now for embedded projects, even the more complex ones. 
But why ? Why make a copycat of electron for Python, when we already have electron?
Honestly, there's a whole lot of people who care more about a language being easy to use than how it's going to perform. Real world example: If you can get a biologist you employ already to learn to run stats with python, that's way cheaper than hiring a C programmer to do it, even if you lose some time in the execution.
Dude, I am not making a remark on anyone's IQ. Simplicity - some may go as far as stupidity - is an inherent quality in many engineering things. &amp;#x200B; Okay maybe the word stupid went awkward. Just read the first parts of this article from Pike. Go is unimaginative, even boring. \*And that's what they were looking for.\* &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; [https://talks.golang.org/2012/splash.article](https://talks.golang.org/2012/splash.article)
I feel the same about svn. oh snap!
if you aren't using aiopg or asyncpg and are instead using any other database, like MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server, SQLite, you are using a threadpool, because none of the drivers support non-blocking IO at the socket level (or the file level in the case of SQLite). So just use normal DB drivers and a normal thread pool. No more need to fight the inherently blocking nature of transactional DB conversations. &amp;#x200B;
It’s already embedded into history ;)
This should be possible with MultipleLocator and FuncFornatter. Can't give an example on my phone unfortunately. 
So how does one switch to-and-from blocking mode and non-blocking mode? Because so far it sounds to me that this "mode" seems more like an implementation pattern.
Objects have types. Variable is just a pointer to an object, thus it can point to anything.
Geez, I wonder what would happen if someone would run this command on Google backend.

&gt; Pipenv: Python Dev Workflow for Humans I dislike the "for humans" postfix Kenneth whacks on all his software, as if other Python developers are writing libraries for use by pigeons. It's probably justifiable for `requests` as the standard library's HTTP abstractions aren't very nice, but for pipenv not at all applicable (for the reasons this blog post sets out)
Because there are too many good ways to get experience that \*don't\* involve doing a stranger's work for free. As a beginner you don't have much sense of the task at hand, nor do you know anything about the quality of instruction you are getting from a random internet person. Lastly, a bad experience could result in someone being turned off of programming when they may otherwise be quite talented. Instead, stick with something from No Starch Press, and spend time on stackoverflow and r/learnpython

 expr10: 1,
Correct answer (spoilers!): expr1: tuple expr2: int expr3: tuple expr4: list expr5: list expr6: list expr7: dict expr8: set expr9: set Commentary: parentheses are used for both tuples and expression grouping. As expr2 isn't empty and doesn't contain any commas, it isn't interpreted as a tuple. This could be addressed by writing `(1,)`. Braces are used for both sets and dictionaries. When such a sequence has at least one item it's easy to tell whether it's a set or a dict (by the presence of `:`), but `{}` is always a dictionary. An empty set can be created with `set()`

Shit with microcontrollers running at 600mhz Im starting to wonder what people are doing that is so performance sensitive that they need a c or asm solution. Im currently playing around with an i.mx RT1050 with ZerphyrOS and trying to bolt on micropython.
You have to [format code for reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/faq#wiki_how_do_i_format_code.3F). These sorts of questions belong in /r/learnpython.
make a basic text game with 3 classes, monsters and zones? Having to attratibute hp values, defense, attack, gold gain etc to the character the player select etc. You can make it really complicated as you go along.
I would like to suggest that the first sentence right after "about CEF" should explain in very simple terms what it does.
It is not a slow language on a processor with a good branch predictor and speculative execution.
/r/learnpython and read the sidebar.
:/ I still don't get whether the policy here is *no questions* or *no questions related to straightforward python*. For example a question like, "I want to share python code between a real-time operating system and a standard python webapp" would seem like an interesting question, but "How does for work" does not. T
I don't have a problem with "for humans" specifically. As more and more ~~"data scientists" and "analytics developers"~~ non-developers are picking up the language for doing scripting in support of their daily stuff, but they aren't specifically coders/CS people/etc. then it makes sense to describe an API that is for "regular people not expected to understand arcane underlying mechanics". In terms of that "naughty list", SQL for humans is a thing, as SQL was basically "relational algebra for humans". It's an abstraction layer so that you don't have to care what dialect your using, but avoids all the bloat of SQLAlchemy if you don't need discrete object mapping ("I just care about iterating through rows") and pandas if you don't need funky stats functions (and pandas doesn't abstract the SQL either, it just asks db-api driver to execute what you tell it then loads a dataframe).
honestly at this point I feel if pip by itself is insufficient for your needs, you probably need to go full blown conda.
No sidebar on mobile. It’s ok tho got the explanation thanks 
Google "reddit sidebar" and the name of your mobile app. Don't be lazy.
Until you find out that it's really not great for cpu bound problems without dropping into another language and the story on concurrency is pretty weak. And don't even consider packaging and distribution on something like a desktop platform (and backend is pretty weak), because that's just downright terrible. But otherwise, it's pretty rad.
Python is a great choice for testing embedded systems too. Libraries like [PySerial](https://pypi.org/project/pyserial/) and [PyVISA](https://pypi.org/project/PyVISA/) make it easy to basic automate test equipment, e.g. power supplies, function generators, etc. More complex test hardware like DAQs can typically be scripted with a bit of effort.
Try it on your own ... that's part of the beauty of python :) karl = 'they have a world to win' &amp;#x200B; then type: karl ... what does the repl print ? now karl.split() ; what is different ? now modify the loop to print other things inside ... thing, karl.count(thing) .... &amp;#x200B;
as much as I really don't want to pipenv (especially over poetry) at this point, I think these tools are being created now for a reason and concluding that pip is still the best choice by itself? seems silly all 3 tools solve at least some of awefulness that is managing in any reasonable way with setup.py and requirements.txt.

I disagree with this statement because `zip` has a meaning in python, and therefore it's needlessly confusing to refer to anything but the inverse of the `zip` function as "unzipping".
Thats evil
So you are going to do what Amazon can't even do?
You should try [PyDoc](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/pydoc.html), which is part of the standard library. It can help you parse your .py files and generate the documentations.
It take a stroke, split it on words, and then in for-loop put in dictionary two values: the length of the each word and how many times each word occurences in the stroke var. As you have two words with length 4 ('they' and 'have') the dict contains only 5 key-value pairs. (As key must be unique) Hope it helps.

Just wondering, don't you need to have low level memory management for embedded systems, in general? I'm not an expert by any means but I always thought that was the case.
Fair. Googled and it seems to be called “unpacking”. Sorry. 
That sounds interesting, but I would think you'd want low level control for embedded systems, no? Are there specific libraries for this sort of thing that vie you more granular control of hardware for different platforms? I could see using python for embedded stuff giving you a whole lot of unforseen bugs.
I've used it for applications and haven't run into too many problems. I do wish it was more flexible though. Poetry looks like a nice, flexible alternative. I do think it's worth pointing out the stuff around PyPA and "official" stuff in the Python community tends to be deeply political. Ever wonder how seemingly dogcrap libraries made it into the standard lib? It wasn't always because it was the best thing they had around back then.

Great to hear. That would be a good talk to see on YouTube. Good cause - more women bringing coding into their STEM careers. 
What would you suggest?
There are numerous use cases for CEF.
There are numerous use cases for CEF. It is more than just Electron.
What would you suggest? It's kind of hard to explain it in one sentence.
Are most of these can even be considered “data types”?
This *is* a basic question. It's asking how to write maths in code, and how to write what may be one line of matplotlib. It's also low-effort and shouldn't be welcomed in /r/learnpython either IMO - no attempt made, no detail about what they actually want, just this sketchy-ass referral link.

I'm on mobile and I have a sidebar. Maybe you mean app?
Tuple?
I mean. It's a community that literally reinvented the `wheel`. Clearly, we have problems to solve, but just keep going around in circles.
It's actually used a lot in scientific computing for cpu bound problems because of libraries like numpy. Threaded concurrency might not be required in that domain when you can use processes and spin up another VM. It's hard for me think of a situation where the nature of the program demands that you have to use a single machine.
Manufacturing hundreds of thousands or running hard real-time? Seems like those are the only real reasons these days to be mucking about with malloc as far as I can tell. (But I'm no embedded systems engineer, so wtf do I know, lol)
Did you know Python has a specific operator for unpacking the one item out of an iterable? `varname ,= mylist` will set `varname` to the one item in the list or raise an error if it has 0 or 2+ items. (That does work, but `,=` is nothing more than `,` followed by `=`. It's the same thing happening here, just destructuring a tuple rather than creating one.)
Modern embedded microcontroller are about as powerful as a 1980s 8-bit machine but have better programming environments. While you don't need low level control, it's useful to have.
Have you ever done dual language dev in Python? 'Cause it's actually really easy. Both to embed the interpreter in a C++ host and to write routines that execute in C. The fact that both those stories are so good in Python is, IMHO, a huge part of the reason it's taken off so much in scientific computing. Optimizing only the hard part is a snap.
Depends on your resource. A lot of microcontrollers now have way way more memory than you need, so why bother? Low level memory management is a fun computer science puzzle, and a pain in the ass as part of your actual job-job. :-)
yay I got it right
They are expressions that evaluate into something that has a type.
This. Interacting with C is so easy from Python. I truly believe Python's success can be attribute to that, plus readability. It's made it a completely natural choice for academics and scientists, which resulted in a huge ecosystem of libraries.
lol'd for realz.
As long as you never ask this question or anything like it during an interview!
You should be using 4 spaces. This is specified in python's official style guide, PEP8. Any IDE and many text editors will allow you to remap the tab key to enter 4 spaces. Most IDEs and some text editors respect [editorconfig](https://editorconfig.org/), which is great to throw into any shared repositories, and probably your home directory too.
It depends on the class. For instance class SSLSock(): __sock = socket.socket() Because __sock is a hidden attribute, and SSLSock() does not provide a method for changing that socket's behavior, the answer here is "no". But of course being python /technically/ the answer is yes (because you can get at __sock with some magic). 
The only reason I got pipenv was because I was learning Python and wanted to try webscraping, so I started reading through a tutorial and came to the conclusion pipenv was required to use requests. Was rather surprised when I found out pipenv wasn't necessary, and never used it for anything after that.
Ditto, I don't understand how pipenv helps enough to warrant the time spent installing and reading. Pip and setup.py are just not hard to use. :-/
&gt; Do you expect that there's a correlation between people who know the answer to this trivia and people who are going to be good software developers? There is a correlation, but it's not a very strong one. These sorts of questions are useful for screening out beginners during a phone interview, but I'd skip them if there's documentary evidence that they can reason about the basics. 
Kindof on the same note, python was super simple to use for serial communication with my embedded project. Talking over USB with my microcontroller with python code is so much easier than figuring out c# or something else
I feel all the saltiness is just uncalled for. Software becomes good over time. Packaging and dependency management has been a point of pain forever. We invested a lot into things like reinventing the `wheel` and we still haven't quite stopped spinning our wheels, either. It's important that we get new things out there, iterate on it, and eventually we can turn packaging into a point of pride for Python. Anybody willing to put their new solutions and new patterns out there, particularly in such a highly opinionated area of Python development, deserves recognition and praise for that alone. If you don't like it, or if it does something wrong, why not just contribute to make it better? Also keep in mind that you often have to be a cheerleader for your projects in this line of work, even when you know it's far from perfect. As an illustration: Raymond Hettinger has always been a Py3 evangelist. However, it wasn't until Python 3.5 came around that he actually felt Python3 was better than Python 2 in many ways. Despite what he knew about the technical aspects of the language, he knows that Py3 adoption was of more critical importance to Python than performance characteristics that would improve later, for example.
I have 5 years of experience professionally programming with Python and would not "pass" this question. My answer would probably be something along the lines of: "I don't know, I don't commit things like this to memory."
Firstly, questions like these are more a test of your ability to reason and talk about the language as they are a test of your knowledge. Secondly, what have you been doing for 5 years if you don't know how to write tuple, list and dict literals? They're one of the first things covered in any Python course. Set literals are more obscure but a good candidate would make a decent guess in that direction
I like the slogan. It's a promotion of good API design, something I hope everyone can get behind. Even if a project is not quite *there* yet, I welcome anyone to promote their own work however they like. You want to attract the kind of people who you want contributing to your project. So, for Kenneth, he wants to appeal to people who desire to make good interfaces for other people. Other projects place higher priority on different things like correctness, feature-richness, or consistency.
Whoah whaoh whoah. Tell me more sir.
Is it cross-platform?
In the world of async, anything that's *blocking* totally kills your application. So, the `io` module offers an interface to use *non-blocking* internals instead, to be friendly with your async code. Basically the whole 'mode' deal is just that objects offer this as an interface as an alternative to needing separate methods or classes like having `IoClass` and `NonBlockingIoClass`or `read` and `read_non_blocking`, for example. Hope that helps.
Which company do you guys work for that you’re asking trivia like that as an interview question? Asking so I can avoid it like the plague.
I think a better term for that would by "pythonic", i.e. using language features like object-orientation and context managers to provide natural abstractions and interfaces. That's the appeal of Python more generally - it sacrifices speed and safety for "good" design which makes it easy to learn and apply. "For humans" just seems like an indirect criticism of other libraries, and quite a hyperbolic one at that!
What a dumb question. Hopefully the candidates response is nevermind.
If I asked it in an interview I wouldn't be posting it here. 
I wouldn't use this question. I wouldn't use any kind of language trivia.
Really, it sounds like you feel the projects just aren't *good enough* to use the slogan. `requests` wasn't always good or complete. But it was [pretty much always for humans](https://github.com/requests/requests/commit/2153b21152ae86ff760b5e693ac88d998fd9ddcc) from the start, before it was good. That design goal attracted the right contributors to make it what it is today. I don't see it as criticizing other libraries so much as it is a constant reminder that making good APIs is something to strive for; a real engineering feat. So, maybe some day these other projects *will* become shining examples of what is *pythonic* for the space they're in. At any rate, I don't think it's harmful to set this frame of view from the outset of the project, whether it is the first or best of its kind, or even any good at all.
Being very familiar with CEF, I would be interested in providing day to day monetary support, but with the addition of myself and some of my developers helping to contribute development to help accelerate the releases cycle and bug resolution. If this is something that would interest you/Czarek, let me know and we can talk. 
Although trivial, what I do like about this is that it seems a lot of my recent applicants do not have a good fundamental of things. A perfect recent example I have some pen&amp;paper (for the in-person interviews) interview questions and funnily enough sets seems to confuse some candidates. I think using something like this for a step 2 screen share interview might provide useful. It's getting harder and harder to weed out qualified candidates. 
Yes, please let me know more details via email.
Explain? In my view the aim of a technical interview is to test the candidate's ability to reason. The question prompts the candidate to reason about the differences between various pretty boring, well-known data types.
Depends. If the position needs to be filled with someone with a lot of experience of python, this quick question will weed out people that actually aren’t so familiar with it. The whole interview should not be just questions like this, of course. 
You got it. Sending over a quick contact message now. 
It's a double edged question. Either You know it all and I find out you're a huge python nerd, which is slightly favorable (and makes you more likely to get along with the likes of me :D ), or you don't know and I get to find out how gracefully you fail, which is an extremely valuable thing for an interviewer to find out. I feel like the question itself is marginal at best, precisely because it's trivia. I don't put too much stock in specializing in one language anyway.
I've been building an optional-batteries-included web framework on top of Flask that I'm calling Flask Unchained - this week I'm trying to add a few more tests and get the docs in better shape in preparation for a wider release, hopefully before Christmas.. [https://github.com/briancappello/flask-unchained](https://github.com/briancappello/flask-unchained) (best to install from master if you want to play around with it)
No, the question prompts the candidate to regurgitate trivia. If a candidate could arrive at a passing answer to your question by memorization, it's not a good question. On top of which, this kind of language trivia has almost no relevance to day-to-day programming work. Sure, lots of experienced Python people will know that `()` is an empty tuple, that commas and not parentheses are what make tuples, that `{}` is used in literal syntax for both dicts and sets. But is that the skill you want to test? Is that the signal you're looking for? These are things that someone who's newer to Python (even if not to programming) would just encounter once, learn, and move on. You might as well which of `def`, `define`, and `defun` is correct for defining a function; there's no "reasoning" involved in arriving at the answer, because either you learned it at some time in the past or you didn't. Good interview questions let you see what someone would be like to work with and what they'd contribute to your team. Bad interview questions substitute shibboleths and minutiae and easily-gamed "challenges" for the real thing you want to know. Test for the real thing you want to know, please.
Do you have a link to what Kenneth said?
You called it an “interview question”, which is what I was going off of. Personally I don’t think language design questions are relevant for the vast majority of software development jobs, but maybe your role is niche.
Found the Python programmer who didn't know the answers. *wink* 
Found the Python programmer who didn't know the answers. *wink* 
in a interview i was asked "what maneger connect python with it,s database ?". i searched the whole internet couldn't find the ans. so i guess it must be a some stupid question. 
See my reply to OP's response.
I occasionally use Python in a professional context, amongst a variety of other languages. I write code in a way that doesn’t rely on someone knowing whether (1) resolves to an int. Sue me.
&gt; If a candidate could arrive at a passing answer to your question by memorization, it's not a good question. It's trivial to spot such a candidate. I'm not imagining that this question is asking in a written exam - this is an oral interview and the question is a prompt, as most interview questions are. &gt; On top of which, this kind of language trivia has almost no relevance to day-to-day programming work Understanding the difference between tuples, lists, dicts and sets has relevance. There's a lot that could be said on these topics by a capable candidate, who would have no trouble getting over the 'trivia' part of the question.
&gt; Understanding the difference between tuples, lists, dicts and sets has relevance. Yes. But recognizing the syntax for them is just language trivia. Either you know it, or you don't. If you don't, you look it up or ask someone about it. There's no "reasoning" involved. And you don't learn anything about the candidate's understanding of the data structures (such as when each one is appropriate to use) from checking whether they recognize the literal syntax for them.
You'd be surprised how many people just make something up. Someone applying for a Python role once told me `**kwargs` was a pointer to a pointer, which was a bit of a leap of faith on their part!

Agreed. I feel pipenv leaves a lot to be desired. It doesn't (or didn't) implement all the features of pip.
You've been interviewing better candidates than me :(
Database connection manager, no?
What are your issues with wheels? The biggest issue I see is a lack of a compiler bundled with pip/poetry/etc.
imagine if all this effort had gone into PRs for betterment of poetry/hatch/pipenv etc.

Are there are third party providers of paid support for Micropython? 
[removed]
I've interviewed plenty of people who didn't end up getting hired. And plenty who were quietly ushered out of the process early on. You don't have to use language-trivia contests to identify problems.
&gt; 'Cause it's actually really easy. If you are good at C++, sure. But for a beginner? The articles I find are either 'hello world' or so esoteric that I don't grasp the ins and outs. You might just be that good and I envy you. :)
Non-blocking mode is activated with a flag O_NOBLOCK passed to open() system call. It is handled by the kernel. 
[removed]
My tip on this: lent a recruiter. When you ask a question, candidate can answer in many different ways. You need to know the field to identify if answer is correct.
If you want to work on a big project, maybe find an interesting open source one that you can contribute to? 
Yes sorry, for the typo
Thanks for this. I've tried. But I'm still to green and need assistance. Or at least I think I do. Plus, I have had pretty bad experiences with online interaction within the dev community. Imposter syndrome hits hard with that one. But that may be the only option. Again, never really tried.
I still don't get why all that work isn't put into pip itself since it's already the tool everyone has. The bug problem with pipenv and friends for me is that you need pip to install them in the first place, which means a pip call anyways on every build in CI. Then I might as well just use pip. 
Zerynth... Closed source. No, thanks. Micropython works for me. 
What do you mean by "not readable"? Maybe provide an example and a description of what you've tried and what you would hope to happen.
It's funny you link to that commit which shows the README saying: &gt; I have to look up *everything* that I want to do. To be fair, for basic stuff, requests is fairly straughtforward, but for some reasons I have to lookup the docs much more often than I would like. I think it's inherent to HTTP's complexity mind you.
[tpcg.io/D5EBFp](https://tpcg.io/D5EBFp) this is my program. In the line 19-21 i using cycle, but in this way i have to put every special symbol. Is there way to not write every single special symbol? hope You understand what i mean, its kine hard to explain as a beginer. 
Find a python meetup group and try to make some friends and code with them. Coding can be incredibly lonely and I think it'd be more mentally healthy for all of us if we worked in groups with friends.
It's slow, that's my main issue with pipenv :( 
What sort of stuff are you interested in? There are many projects out there that are actively willing to take on and train new contributors, and I can probably link a few of them for you if you give me a direction. 
So it sounds like you've been grinding this basically completely alone for two years... If you do anything completely on your own for two years you will go insane, man. Humans are social creatures. Look for a coding event like a hackathon near you and try to meet some people or find some projects that catch your interest. And finish some of your early projects. Just to finish them. Just to prove you can.
Ive started coding 6 months ago with basically no tech background and ive been teaching myself about 50 hours a week. I honestly feel your struggles its really hard to keep going when youre working on a project week after week (especially if you have to spend a week refactoring). Some great advice that someone told me was to not worry about wasting other peoples time. try to reach out to developers that you know or go to events it may take you months and it probably will be really uncomfortable but it may help you find people with your mind set and more experience. 
that would be amazing. thank you. I'm all about networking, pen testing preferably. If there are opportunities to take on a a piece of a project in that space, that would be incredible. thanks again, man.
great advice. Weird thing is that I'm as social as it gets. And trust me, I was going insane lol. Got diagnosed with depression a while ago and i think that had a part in it. I just had no idea how to get into the crowd. Do you need to be moderately advanced to get involved in events like hackathons? 
wait so u are saying people in the reddit who had negative opinions are "community" but the people from twitter who had different opinion than reddit are mere "brigade-ers"
mitmproxy is an HTTPS proxy that's mostly written in Python. They have a whole bunch of issues marked as "help wanted" specifically for people who want to start contributing to it: https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22 Does that sound interesting to you! 
great advice. I've triend reaching out online a few times, but that obviously isn't the best way to do it. Gotta be in person. Tried thinking of ways to reciprocate for mentorship but i havent been able to. No idea who I'd even ask. But that's something I'd have to figure out just like anyone else. thanks man,
Yes it sure can. It's been significantly bad for my health, which is a big part in where im at now. Coding with buds seems unfathomable lol. it'd change everything. Unfortunately, most of my friends are more of the "get drunk every weekend and hit the bars." so i'd have to look else where obviously. Thanks man.
For Lambda specifically AWS knowledge is not all that important... the Amazon side of things is pretty well documented and has been designed for ease of pickup, often it's just manipulating standard Python data types, so I'd say most people who are fluent in Python can pick Lambda up quite quickly. Broader AWS knowledge becomes more important outside of Lambda's somewhat contained and constrained world, but even then they've built ecosystems like Elastic Beanstalk and Fargate that are meant to make transitioning up -- albeit at a premium over their more self-managed products -- relatively painless, so long as the person transitioning is fluent in at least one of their more supported languages. As for finding people who are fluent in Python, well that's where a consultant might come in helpful for you. It'll be much easier to hire someone briefly to understand your needs and vet people for you then it will be vet them yourselves. Also since it's early days for your already experienced devs in Python, I'd suggest getting them running on the Python track on [Exercism](https://exercism.io/) and maybe you could try out the new [teams site](https://teams.exercism.io/) ... I'm one of the volunteer mentors on the Python track and I can vouch for the sum of those exercises providing a good basis for fundamental Python fluency.
Absolutely! apprecaite it big time. Looking through the list of bugs now.
"CEF lets you embed an HTML/CSS/JS engine in your UI". If i got it right.
Can you put that code somewhere else? [Pastebin](https://pastebin.com/) would be fine. The link you've given me has an invalid certificate.
tldr; ranting. &gt; but for some reasons I have to lookup the docs much more often than I would like. I really don't get this. Any requests are made in the lowecase http(s) equivalent. requests.get() - requests.post() - requests.options() If you want to persist a websites cookies it sets you use a sesssion session = requests.Session() if you don't want ssl verification you disable it.. requests.get(url, verify=False) Do you really, truly, spend so much time looking up documentation relating to requests, instead of whatever other http library that you possibly may use, that it's a problem? Even if you get into setting headers or messing around with cookies. Even multi-threading with a session, and whatever else you can come up with really isn't a huge ordeal. What about that library could possibly warrant that complaint.
[pastebin.com/qeF2E1GC](https://pastebin.com/qeF2E1GC) hope it gonna work
If all of your experience is on solo projects, then realistically you don't have as much experience developing as a group and developing code in the format they want, everyone starts somewhere so this really isn't a issue, just experience you don't have. I recommend finding some python projects (difficult though it is) on GitHub, looking at the issue tracker and trying to fix some bugs, do the fix, make a pull request and see what happens. This will help you learn to make your code 'fit' whatever project you're helping on and it helps you learn what their code does, then you can start adding features and such like.
You are not alone. From my experience, you can say that a program is finish when you don't need it anymore, replaced by another one. In a project, you can have milestone with the features you need, like (moscow method for example) but this is just project management, not development. Furthermore for personal project, this is really sane to starts things in order to get the reflexion on how to solve a problem. I have many projects on my github like that which are not made to be used on production such as an orm, a task broker , a curl like tool (in rust), ... I wrote them to be a better programer.
The language/processor only needs to be fast enough for the project (with any headroom for expected scope changes). To say it’s not fast enough without specifying a content isn’t useful.
No, that's not what he's saying at all.
I would be happy to answer any specific questions you have. I'm more on the OPs side of DevOps but I work with python and and AWS. 
But then most people do web ui development in Django etc. and don't get it. It seems that "Electron for Python" statement is most clear for everyone.
I'll just say this: I've been coding and learning for a while now. Very steadily for the last 4 years. I still have this problem, and it annoys the crap out of me. You've got an advantage over me though: I like to play with less-mainstream languages (been doing Elm, Rust, and Common Lisp lately), so I don't have quite as much single-language skill as you do. Java is probably what I've used the most, but I don't use it often anymore. Nowadays, I focus on smaller projects. That way I can get stuff done. Recently I got a package submitted into Melpa (emacs package repo), and even though it's pretty little and niche, it felt like a huge accomplishment. I just found something small that didn't exist yet, completely by chance.
If you're just trying to skip the bond characters, you're doing basically the right thing, and something like this will work: BONDS = set("-=#*.") for c in "C=CC#CClC": if c not in BONDS: print(c) However looking at the [OpenSMILES specification](http://opensmiles.org/opensmiles.pdf) that isn't going to help you calculate the molar mass, because you need to know about the bonds to determine how many hydrogens to add, and that's even if you eliminate anything with branching. Are you trying to write a general SMILES parser? This is not going to be easy. 
Yes, it's possible. Beyond that I think you're going to need to ask some more concrete questions if you want to get any broader discussion or feedback.
Make an online board game or card game of some sort. Build it online so people can log in and, search for waiting players and login and play. Build this on a service like AWS or GCP. Take advantage of back end features like dynamoDB, Lambda etc. &amp;#x200B; Taking a board game like checkers or something is easy. You already know the rules (or at least wiki does) and you can think only of the coding challenges. You can think out the architecture and how to use AWS's tools to architect. Think about building a pipeline and automated tests and updates for your code in AWS build pipeline and stuff. Build a front end in Javascript but a backend REST server that fires off jobs to lambda and back end services.
As a java developer that was thrown into the deep end writing only Python on AWS (monolith + serverless).... Your java developers will be just fine to change language. Make sure your application architect or dev lead knows how to well architect a cloud native application as well as how to transition the existing one. Then make sure you find yourself a great DevOps person/team that can build you a solid environment with good ci/cd. PM me if you're interested in contracting out the architecture, development and/or DevOps or whatever else you need. I am an applicant architect for are a Premier AWS Consulting Partner.
Why does a broken video have 142 upvotes? Just curious...
I’d like it if it delivered. By self admission, it’s more about marketing. Pipenv is an example of the marketing getting ahead of reality, a classing bait and switch. 
For example the eject button to be funktioning simotaniously. Is that a hard thing? 
In our experimental physics group we use PyVISA for long-running experiment control and data collection. It works quite well. There is also a pure-python backed, pyvisa-py, that does not rely on expensive adapters and their proprietary binary drivers.
Totaly agree. Plus, the Zerynth IDE is a pain to use. In Micropython you can use your favorite editor.
After line 18, add an “else:” with a “return 0”. 
If you have developed enough skills then you could look for a job in python programming. It will give you a fixed project you must finish and also a team to work with. You can ask them for help without feeling like you are being a burden.
This exists and I am sitting at work with a headache trying to update a decade old driver written by a co-worker years ago to use a CC2500 with a PIC uC. What a time to be alive.
The terminal on vscode is merely the one you have on your system. If you configure your system's terminal it should also be reflected in the integrated terminal of vscode.
ive come across at least these things .. and yes you can argue some of them are for different things .. but wtf does TIOOWTDI mean ? pipenv pyenv pip easy_install conda vistualenv venv vagrant / docker / lxc 
I think it just takes time. And yeah, marketing is a big part of it. Projects get better faster when more people are interested in it. I'm not sure it's exactly a bait and switch, but I agree it doesn't live up to some expectations, wherever those expectations may come from. But that's also a good opportunity for people with good expectations to be driving requirements for improvements and new features.
Thats exacly what im looking for, thank you very much. I dont need to include hydrogens in my task. Have a nice day=)
I can second this. I learned to programme at uni but my uni was super strict about not assisting each other with work. So after one full year of struggling through projects alone it did wear me down somewhat. I'm in a job now and having your team to turn to when you hit that wall helps to not get demotivated so much. And you will learn so much from them in the process. Coding with other people is a much more enjoyable experience.
Python has a builtin module ‘csv’ with which you can read your input. You can save your data in a 2D array or in a special data structure. Look into the ‘pandas’ library for fancy data structures and manipulation. If you have any other questions, let me know!
Yes
I went to my first Hackathon as a second year maths student (surrounded by CS students), and had menial html/CSS knowledge and maths-based python and R knowledge. That experience was amazing for me, I was honest from the outset about how much I knew, found a team on the day and contributed to the code where I could. I learned so much from teammates that did know what they were doing, and they were patient enough when I needed help because they knew my background. Throw yourself in mann, no one here can guarantee what the people will be like - if a couple of people are snobby about your experience then just move to the next lot, there'll be some people there with similar experience/ willing to team up with you.
Comes down to a matter of taste, I guess. I see both Kenneth's projects and Python itself as being successful for similar reasons: good first impressions, and being "too big to fail". It leaves a bad taste in my mouth to see such brazen attempts at "growth hacking" one's way to become too big to fail, not with good clean code and api design, but with politics. Masquerading as being the "official" endorsed way to do things is a transparent strategy to try to use bandwagon effects. This makes it less likely to "give way to other projects with better ideas". 
Why so aggressive? Honestly this pisses me off. I'm not being harsh, just stating my usual need to lookup the docs for things I tend to forget. For instance, with HTTP I think of query and body, not params and data. I keep making that tiny mistake. I even acknowledge this is more due to HTTP complexity (because it is a complex protocol). I didn't say requests was bad, just that I had to go to the docs more than I expected. Go be mean somewhere else please.
Well i can think of a lot of reasons why but mostly it is this: python is good for learning programming. It is not a proper language for building software but people make stupid choices all the time because it looks easy at the moment.
No, that's easy.
Sweet! Thanks.
I used `pipenv` for a while but there were so many regressions and bugs, that I switched back to good old `pip-tools` (which gets the job done so much better). Something like `pipenv` is definitely needed, but in its current form I think it’s far from production ready.
Thats my concern. With Java, we're on it. Python, not so much.
Yeah - some of us (myself included) have learnt python from scratch over the last 6 months. I really like it. Thanks for the tips on courses.
Thanks
My instinct tells me the same. I am the CTO, so I'm the one architecting as well but I'm self taught and wary of what I don't know. Good challenges to have of course. We're UK based, where are you?

&gt; Something like pipenv is definitely needed, In this day and age of micro services, micro packages, micro deployments, why do you want to have a monolith doing three things at the same time?
Seriously I believe this is a wrong usage of the Python language. Is trying to make a fish to climb a tree.
Dude I’m gonna start writing code for pigeons
But you can find more than 100 Zerynth open source libraries on [GitHub](https://github.com/zerynth). Or just take a look [here](https://www.zerynth.com/blog/python-libraries-for-embedded-and-iot-over-100-repositories-on-zerynth-github/). Concerning the IDE, it's based on the [Zerynth toolchain](https://docs.zerynth.com/latest/official/core.zerynth.toolchain/docs/index.html), which you can use with all your preferred tools.
If you're looking for an alternative, you could also try Adafruit's fork called Circuitpython. They're somewhat ahead in terms of hardware support.
I started to learn Python this week. First ever programming language I am learning. I am just trying to figure out what I can do with Python in general now.
It is, indeed. Pays my full-time job... :-) I'd also add using ctypes/[python.NET](https://github.com/pythonnet/pythonnet) to access [IVI](http://www.ivifoundation.org) drivers when needed. [python-can](https://python-can.readthedocs.io/en/2.1.0/) is also nice if you work around automotive embedded systems.
You are probably close to breakthrough. I get this way before something finally gives, if I keep going. Just keep going! Also, Don’t be ashamed of “begging” for help. We all need it from time to time and I believe it’s the best thing about the internet. Shared knowledge is why it exists!
Funny you talked about microservices. In the world of Devops, microservices, we absolutely need packages that do their job well, small and simple enough to work reliably and not many bugs. Pipenv falls short, I have a bug the other day with pipenv reported install pysolr successful in Docker build, but not actually install the package. I mess around with it for a few hour and just use "pipenv lock -r" and use good old pip. I'm not going to use pipenv in future projects.
Hey, I'm also a sort-of beginner looking to help out in open source projects, are there any that are particularly helpful but lacking in resources? I want to give back where I could be most useful but I just don't know where to start. 
If you have python3 installed it works :)
I release a new version, could you try with this, a verified If are you using python3?
It's much easier to develop a separate package and try out different things, than try to make a bunch of PRs accepted into PIP. These tools are relatively new, they should reach at least the v1.0 milestone before any consideration of merging into PIP or becoming an official tool. PIP is not necessary required for the install, e.g. your distribution could have a package for them as well (just like for PIP itself).
You are aware that pipenv use a vendorized copy of pip internally? 
Hello, I'm no enough good with Python, for this reason I could have some mistakes in code. Yes, I use setup tools to build an installation process. I remove the code from video_to_ascii/__init__.py intentionally, because I was looking for python repos finding similar __init__.py files, the code was moved to player.py, let me know if this a mistake plase. bin/video-to-ascii is an small cli file, out of the main package folder because using from terminal is just an option, you could use as a normal package in other projects. Exactly, Player is a module that will allow to encapsulate the most useful functions. render_strategy simulates an abstract class to understand what is the signature of a strategy class, to allow to contribute with new render strategies. Im not using a entry point, just specify an script to be copied to the bin folder, if desired use.

 I don't understand the rant in this post. He says &gt; Pipenv doesn’t help me to write a setup.py, distribute code, or manage releases. It just manages dependencies. What's the problem with it? Pipenv is made to manage your dependencies in a separate environment. He is complaining that it doesn't do what it never claimed it was made for? Pipenv makes it easy to create a separate environment and manage your dependencies, like npm. It might not be perfect, but it gets this task done. By the way, Enthought EDM is missing from the list of alternatives, and I must say it's quite good. 
Even better on the ESP32 (technically in flash not ROM on this platform)
Why does nobody mention [flit](https://github.com/takluyver/flit)? It’s exactly for the complimentary use case: Packaging libraries. It is designed for the 90% of libraries that are pretty simple (one module per PyPI package, pure python), based on pyproject.toml, and does what it does very well.
What sort of stuff are you into?
Am I right to assume this utility is indifferent to the language the web app is built in? JS, PHP, Python or whatever? 
The problem is that pipenv, at least at the time of that blog post, was advertised as the be-all end-all answer to everything about packaging, virtual environments and dependency installation. If you had actually read the blog, you would have seen that stated in the intro. 
You can backup everything. Just specify your path (with -d option) and set a config.ini file
Didn't know esp32 got that too.
Bashing Kenneth looks like a lucrative career, guess i should join the bandwagon.
Personally, mostly data science, machine learning, or security, but I'm also always happy to learn stuff I wouldn't always look out myself.
Thanks for sharing, this is rad! This should be added to [roots.io](https://roots.io) / trellis! 
He moaned about the 'hatred for pipenv' he received from /r/python in his recent interview on realpython
Micropython is the stuff of dreams, easy to develop for, fast turnaround and relatively stable. We use it extensively for small sensor stuff. For heavier stuff we are working with Machinekit on a Beaglebone as it gives your real time interaction trough its PRU. Still we use Python to talk to machinekit to control robots.

I read the blog. So the argument is that some guy coding pipenv had a big dream, shot for the stars, missed and either won't achieve it or hasn't achieved it yet? 
Any good websites / blogs about it ?
True, it's always darkest right before dawn :) Keep on going man!
There is also Cython which is just awesome.
How do you deal with people cheating in unison to unlock a living persons will? That seems to be a major weak point in your concept.
I have used virtualenv, pyenv and I use pipenv these days. Out of the three Pipenv has been by far the most comfortable and stable tool for me. Pyenv can become a nightmare quickly.

Your attitude needs to change. Seriously. If you're contributing to a project, but you need some assistance, how is that begging? For that matter, if someone is new to programming and they just don't get it, reaching out for help to learn isn't begging either, or at least it shouldn't be seen that way IMO. Of course you don't want to say "I don't know how" if you think that means your a dirty, stinking, rotten beggar. So change your attitude. Asking for help isn't begging, its asking for help. Contribute something back, be involved, help others so that you can reap enough karma to earn the help of others, however you have to rationalize it. No one knows everything. Thinking you have to be entirely self sufficient or you just suck is a path to destruction and despair, as you so adequately demonstrate in this post. &amp;#x200B; The most obvious place where you can both contribute and collaborate with others to learn from them is an Open Source project. Find one in networking that appeals to you and start contributing. If you think you might have a solution but you can't close the gap, explain your idea and ask for help. It isn't demeaning, you're doing what successful people all over the world do every day.
I mean, what was your endgame here? You spent two years learning a programming language - why? Was it to get a job? If so, then get a job - 1500 hours of experience is more than enough to get you a junior dev job (maybe not even *that* junior). If it was to build something specific, then why haven't you built it yet? &amp;#x200B; And remember - time you enjoyed wasting, wasn't wasted at all.

It's a great language, though using it in larger projects can be difficult without employing the ecosystem of tools out there to help. That's what's nice about Exercism; it starts with TDD with `pytest`, encourages `pylint`, and interacting with mentors will get you introduced to a lot of the professional toolset. The Slack also has a decent community that could give advice as well.
...But pyenv is completely unrelated to pipenv and solves a different problem.
Look into PyBind11. It makes it really easy.
&gt;I've never spoken a word in person to anyone on the subject of programming. With so many beggars, I just refuse to be that guy milking it and pissing people off looking for handouts. I think this is your biggest issue. It's damn near impossible to do everything all by yourself. And 9 out of 10 times, talking to someone else about your programming problem is how you actually figure out what you're doing wrong. Besides, asking for help on a topic isn't begging; asking someone to fix your code every time you run into a bug is. Take a break, play a video game, go on a run. Idk, do some woodwork, or something...but don't quit.
You know, it might be that you're the project manager on this one. You know what you want to accomplish. Worth thinking about. 
Yes. Thats why even if you use the `threads` module only one core can be utilized. With `multiprocessing` new processes are spawned which means the memory is not shared. That creates overhead. Larry Hastings is now for a few years working on the "GILectomy", but it's hard to remove it without loosing single thread performance 
well, i am using `pyenv`, `pyenv-virtualenv` and `pip-tools` almost 3 years and i don't have any problem that `pipenv` try to resolve. I prefers three tiny tools that give me great functionality, than a big tool that try to do too much things and is slow and complicated doing this.
If you're writing python2, you need to install virtualenv. if you need to build or push distributions (we do in CI), you need to install wheel and twine. I dont see bootstrapping tooling as being an especially important knock/consideration. (Havent used hatch, but) pipenv and poetry do solve problems that you ultimately probably *do* need to workaround: - `poetry/pipenv run` means you can basically forget about virtualenvs, and you can write tooling around them which doesn't need to first activate an env - poetry and pipenv both solve the dev/prod dependency dichotomy, which you would otherwise need (well at work, we have found we need) to solve with `pip-compile`, another dependency. - poetry and pipenv both have lock files, which are great (requirements.txt is an okay substitute), but automatically keep them in sync with your abstract depedencies. - poetry also replaces setup.py and setup.cfg, which is a fantastic boon - poetry also replaces twine and wheel (or uses them, either way i dont need to worry about it) Again, not to imply that they're perfect, but pip by itself has deficiencies that everyone is individually working around through their own custom workflows; which is being at least in-part addressed by these other tools.
Go and contribute to https://pybee.org/contributing/ 
Not trying to be harsh or squash any dreams but sometimes programming isn't for everyone. I know there is a big push from schools and big tech to teach everyone how to program but that is not feasible. It seems like you have the passion but lose interest at the end. There are some good suggestions here and you should give them a go. I would add maybe you should take classes online for free that teach you how to program. Learning a language is nice and all but that does not make you a programmer. The language is a tool but comp sci is the theory on how to use the tool to solve tasks. https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-4.html#%_toc_start Would be a good place to start and them move onto OOP. There is a free comp sci program out there on GitHub hub that is like a four year college degree in comp sci as well if you are interested.
&gt; and you can write tooling around them which doesn't need to first activate an env - It's a common misconception that you need to activate a virtual environment to run something inside it. You don't.

You’ll probably want to ask over at r/learnpython. That sub has lots of people who love to help. This sub here is mostly for news about Python. 
You just need a job. Im learning python to complement my network engineering stuff, im lucky that in my work the sysadmin is really good in python so i write initial code and he finish it and later we review the code and he explain me the new feature or the better implementation, we even run tests and see which runs faster. So if you can find a job in python it will help you and you will be excited
I personally rarely did any learning projects. I don't find them motivating because to me, developing is mostly a means to an end of making something that is useful, especially to others that will pay me. I am self-taught as well, learned enough to do some freelance work through elance and vworker, and then just applied to jobs through a recruiter. I don't know your life situation, and I apologize for any wrong assumptions I'm making, but I'm going to make the assumption that you are putting in all this effort to kickstart a currently nonexistent dev career. If I'm wrong, feel free to ignore the rest of my post. My question is: have you looked into trying to get a job as a junior developer? There are companies out there that really can't afford to hire additional experienced developers but could take on someone green and give them room for training in exchange for a lower salary. These places can be especially good if there are senior developers there who are willing to mentor you as you gain experience. There's really nothing that can replace real-world experience, and nothing will motivate and validate all your hard work quite like a real-life product and a paycheck. It's easy to get into the mindset that you need to prove yourself as perfectly competent before even attempting the job market, but that mindset is entirely wrong (IMHO). As long as you're mature enough show you can be a trustworthy, dependable, and likeable person, it's possible to get yourself in the door somewhere. If it makes sense for you to seek employment, I would look into recruiters. Talk with them about your situation and see if they know companies who have a junior position available. You don't need to be a perfect developer to be perfect for a particular job. If even the idea of seeking a junior dev position seems unreachable, another route would be to look for job opportunities at small software companies that aren't developer positions. For example, you could get a job in a technical/client support department, which usually doesn't require much specialized skills. In smaller companies especially, where you can interact face-to-face and become friendly with the developers, it can definitely be a route to becoming a junior dev if you've already proven yourself to be trustworthy, dependable, and likeable. Small companies often require their employees to "wear several hats," meaning that there may be opportunities for you to incorporate your dev knowledge into your list of responsibilities. Also, having knowledge of your companies products gives you a big advantage in terms of your training. And of course, you save the company from taking a (likely more expensive) gamble on someone who hasn't yet proven they're trustworthy, dependable, or likeable. (Yeah, I sound like a broken record, but at the end of the day, your skills don't matter if you don't have these fundamental qualities, so prioritize them!) I guess my point in all of this is that, getting your first dev job (assuming this is what you're seeking) should not be the end goal of all your learning. The reality is that your first dev job will likely be the beginning of your real learning. There's a lot to learn in just being an employee beyond coding skills. Don't avoid trying to get your foot in the door somehow for fear of not being good enough, because that fear can paralyze you forever. Present yourself as you are without shame - a hard-working self-learner who is eager to get (or work toward) a junior dev position and work alongside senior devs to hone your skills and continually elevate your contribution to the company. Of course, keep working hard at learning, but don't be ashamed of what you don't know yet. You will of course encounter companies that want someone more experienced, but your goal shouldn't be to get a job you can't do. Trust in your current ability to be productive and seek out positions that can use your productivity and offer you a path toward where you want to go. Trust that you're worth something right now, even if your goal is to be worth a lot more in the future. I know that sounds impossible, especially with imposter syndrome, but it's the truth.
What about finding a job? Working with people who know more than you is the best way (imo) to learn and develop further. Also, this might be an unpopular opinion but I really like hanging out with my colleagues after work, just talking about anything techy, including work stuff - i find that I learn a lot just by listening to more senior people discussing among themselves. So maybe finding a job (or meetup group) and just hanging out with those people is a way to reduce your frustration. Finally, as others have already mentioned, an open source project is a good idea. PS. you can always send me a message if you want to chat about development, or have a problem you can't debug! Two brains are better than one :D 
I don't quite understand your situation, do you just do this as a side thing? If you really want to be writing python that badly why don't you try to make a career out of it?
A good friend of mine started just like that, 3 years ago. She was a junior at my school and I "mentored" her for 6 months. Last year she traveled to the UK to give a talk at a python conference in October (can't recall which one). I am so proud of her. Regarding mentoring part, I mostly spent time pointing her to resources and docs and sometimes share some snippets when she'd be stuck. But she did everything on her own. Point being, imposter syndrome is real. Find a mentor, and keep on with it. We all have tonnes of personal projects we never finish. And it's okay! She mainly contributed to the cython and scikit projects, and there's a very helpful and open community for helping new (and old) programmers. The fact is that you definitely learned a lot. Unless you really aren't into programming, don't quit. You'll get better every day. 
Thanks for the tip, think I will. 
Meetup.com might have some... meetups you can get to around your area. Or look for other local dev meetups / conferences in any way possible. Hell, talk rabidly in your favourite OSS projects' IRC channels until you can get some analysis and construction going with other people.
You might be the hardest worker you know... **but you're not the most effective**. You can't finish something. Flitting away to a new topic when the old is boring, or tough, or both. A team doesn't want that guy. That super awesome company wants the coder that can commit to putting in the *other* 90% of the work needed to bring a project to completion. EVERY job has a shitty part. If you want to apply all the stuff you've learned to be a source of employment... well it's gonna be a job, and it'll have a shitty part. Finish some goddamn projects. START WITH SIMPLE ONES. Polish them to a T. Choose one or two others to really give a good go on. Something where, when you finish, you can really show them off to someone else. "Yep, completed that, look what it does. Kinda cool." I'm not saying this from some high and mighty position, I've been in the same place plenty of times, but I know the above is the reality and wanted to reiterate it to you as well.
&gt; I just can't finish a damn project. For what its worth, I have 44 github repos that all represent something I started and likely didn't finish. One thing you will probably learn before too long, software is never done. It sounds like what you need is a job. Without an external entity defining the "done" state, you will probably never be done with anything no matter how many feature sit has.
Precisely what I'm trying to do. The issue is I have no way to benchmark myself. I have no idea what level my skill set is that so, along those lines, I have no idea what my worth is. Or what's even marketable. I've heard to get a lot of entry level programming jobs you basically need to know object-oriented 101 and the basics. But I don't know if that's true. Making a career out of it is the reason I started in the first place, for sure.
Sounds like you're a brilliant developer with ADHD. Join the club! 😀
Thank you for this! I will give it a good look as soon as possible.
Great insight. I am a IT recruiter by trade which is why I got into this in the first place. I've always been looking for a role in a hybrid capacity that would leverage Balls, but those are few and far between. My ultimate goal is to make a career out of development, whatever path that may take
Thank you, I needed to be reminded of that. I know I did learn a lot even though I don't have one singular project that I can tout. My endgame is absolutely to make a career out of this. I'm an IT recruiter by trade and so a hybrid role would be ideal or I could use my skills from both, however just being able to work a job as a entry-level programmer to get started would be amazing
You’ll get more help over at r/learnpython. This sub here is used to share news about Python. 
Thank you so much for this! I will absolutely be giving it a good look very shortly.
Sure thing man. I've had a lot of creative ideas in the past on how to compensate for the help, But I haven't been able to come up with anything as of yet
Oh okay thank you, I'll delete this then!
You know I really appreciate this. I am completely taken aback by the support I'm getting here, and this is a perfect example. Thank you.
That type of structure I've found is absolutely essential one doing anything and programming. Unless you have clearly defined boundaries or at least a clearly defined and game, it's virtually impossible to stay on task and not go around in circles
This right here
You obviously know exactly what you're talking about. And I couldn't agree with you more. Like I've mentioned to others on this post, I simply have no idea what it would make me a qualified candidate. I've heard that all it takes is knowing the basics, object oriented 101 etc. but I simply don't know. Could you shed some light on that?
Thank you, sincerely. But I don't know about brilliant ;). But absolutely the ADHD is on point lol. Good to know I'm not alone!
A tl'dr of an answer is: get a job in development as a Junior. I started programming 8 years ago the same way you did, however after 6 months of learning by myself I realised I was learning the wrong way. You need experienced developers around you to teach you stuff and to bounce ides off. Regarding your fear of "begging" for help, that's nonsense, remember that all Senior developers where once Juniors and a lot of them don't forget that. The changes of finding one ore more Seniors in a company to help you out are pretty damn high. So don't be afraid, apply for a job as a Junior and have fun, you will see that your life will change for the better (that is if you enjoy coding :)) ) 
Start applying. If you went two years with minimal help you can probably land something. Force yourself to finish up two projects. Speak proudly of them in the interview. Be honest with them where you are and what you want.
Build a website, build some simple tools, and reference them in your resume. If you can't finish a simple mundane project coding in python for anything more than a hobby isn't for you.
Will it work in Windows terminal?
setup.py is more difficult than it needs to be, and the documentation isn't great.

If you're kinda in the same situation as OP: no resume or alma mater whatever, just a Github to prove you coded your butt off, where do you start? For sure making a LinkedIn or something with just your GH won't get you anywhere right?
I may be wrong but it doesn't look like it's in pycache. It's in the pymap folder along with the pycache folder.
I'm not sure , you could try it and tell me if works
I so feel your pain and share your story. I am very appreciative of some of the free content people provide, and try to follow it; what has happened in a number of cases of getting stuck, and having no one to consult. I think being on a team where there are colleagues to ask to take a look would make all the difference in the world. That is how I learned VB years ago. 
Working on a hold detector for use with strength routines (ie rings, hand balancing, etc.) It's basically a simple motion detector with a tkinter interface, and when it doesn't detect motion, it times the hold. Still getting the motion detection to work properly, and I have a list of features I want to add but haven't yet implemented
Doesn't sound like a Python problem.
Yeah, sooo...?
You probably know more than I do and I've been doing web apps and websites for 12 years. To be fair I know a lot about Linux and web servers, I just don't feel pressured to climb the big CS ladder because I don't want my life to revolve around living and breathing computing. I'm already living a comfortable (single) lifestyle putting 1500 into savings/retirement every month. I'm sure you could find an offer with minimal effort.
I don't know how common this sort of pattern is, but in the app I work on, all of the objects of the same type (e.g. players) would be stored in the same table. Then you have linker tables which use foreign key relations to match them up to each other. So you'd have a table with player name, ID, position, DoB etc. Then you'd have a table with team name, ID, home stadium, founding year and so on. You'd then have a player-team table which has a player ID, a team ID, a year they joined and a salary (for example). The game table would have two team IDs and the score; the goals table would have a player ID, a game ID, and a time. You do a lot of joins but it means you don't have to dynamically generate tables.
Will be doing this later 
Holy shit I’ve been looking for this exact type of browser so much that I was really thinking about just switching to Arch Linux and making it keyboard-oriented. Hopefully this can be the first open source project I could help with cause I love this shit 
Mentioning the error ur getting would be nice. And the 'code' button is meant to preserve indentation and stuff.
A career? no. Getting your foot in the door with an entry level job? Possible. If you do actually get the hang of python, it won't be too hard to pick up other languages.
Are you looking for a job? Where do you live?
I would absolutely into a job in development. I live in Milwaukee Wisconsin, but I'm not married/don't have kids meaning I have no qualms with moving anywhere in the continental United States for a job in development.
Lua was designed to be lightweight since the begging of its conception. Python, at the other hand, was designed to be a general purpose language with batteries included. It was trimmed down to fit in embedded systems, just to leverage the momentum of the language as a whole, but I don't think it is the optimal scripted language for such area. &amp;#x200B; Forth is a completely different beast, it can achieve the same degree of flexibility of Lua and Python, with a performance comparable to C.
You have imposter syndrome. People consider themselves an expert once they finish the tutorial on angular. 
I would second this reply. Things like StackOverflow and even subreddits like this one have grown from people's need to ask questions around different aspects of code. Collaborating and asking questions is not begging, we've all done it to some degree and it's how we progress. Absolutely not a psychologist but it kinda sounds like you're a bit burned out or something. Turn the laptop off for a while and read a book and come back to it when you're ready and have a goal or a task to point towards.
This. OP, I'll also say that when you want to give up is when you should not. Go to Meetup, find a group, work on a project with other people. You've put so much time in, it would be a shame to quit.
I think we all hit this point once in our life. I, too, started thinking about whether software engineering is my true passion and I got the hard, cold answer; no. I feel the joy of making something work, but its just not enough. Moreover after some time-consuming info gathering of how work environment would look like (stupid irrational deadline, stakeholder could care less about code quality, dwelling over dinosaur technology just because its well-known -- yeah, have fun using such outdated tools when the new de facto standard solves past tools problem -- and some other BS I wouldn't mention here; just browse r/cscareerquestion and you'll see what I mean), thats definitely not what I was aiming. What I love about programming is I can have my own virtual lab to build basically everything I could think of. So I started learning math (gonna do physics afterwards) -- subject that were used to scare me to hell but I gave it another try through MIT OCW series -- and I've never been more happy. Low-level programming and ML is one thing that got me going again because it makes me feel what I'm building is matter again (instead of copy pasting codes from SO just enough to make things work like a dead brain code monkey I were while working in, say, some Java project). I reckon you to ask yourself too, OP. Beside programming, what are some other things on the back of your mind that you never actually tried, and how to incorporate programming into it? I can't guarantee, but its very likely you'll find another reason to be around. Best of luck!
:( Publish first, let the shame of bugs and unfinished features in production propel you to new heights!! But I feel you, personal projects are especially hard. I've found that journaling has helped quite a bit in the past, even something as simple as taking 2 minutes every day to write short-medium term goals down is really good to keep focus and motivation up.
Python + Rust makes a much more appealing alternative: [https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2017/11/16/speed-python-using-rust/](https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2017/11/16/speed-python-using-rust/)
### Ugh, been there. When you're self taught and work for yourself, it's super easy to feel discouraged. The best advice anyone could give you is _try to finish things_. That feeling of accomplishment, no matter how small the task may be, will give you the drive to finish the next thing, and the next, and the next. I've bean at it alone for nearly 3 years now. If you're a reader, consider checking out [Rework](https://www.amazon.com/Rework-Jason-Fried/dp/0307463745), it's written in part by the [guy who invented Ruby on Rails](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Heinemeier_Hansson) and is filled with great tips for being productive as a developer/project lead. If you're own your own, you're both of those things. As many have echoed here, asking for help is not irritating, or a _burden_, especially if you can't find the answer yourself. Asking the question may make the solution available to someone else and that's a _service_. I hope all goes well, regardless of whatever you end up doing.
I am already using headless firefox, &gt;"You could also look at directly sending the form post" Btw how can I do this? &amp;#x200B;
From a CPU and programming point of view the term "embedded systems" covers a very large range of capabilities and sizes these days. Tiny microcontrollers which require C/asm and bit flipping, i.e. traditional embedded programming, still exist but the range goes up to multi-GB ram Linux systems with multi-core ARM chips, plus every combination in between. The price vs performance of these embedded chips and SoCs has improved immensely the last few years. For a lot of companies it makes sense to spend a bit more on silicon per unit and gain the extra flexibility and cheaper development costs on the software side. Now, if you don't mind I have to get back to work hacking Python for our embedded system (ARMv7, 2 cores, 1GB RAM, 2GB flash running CPython 3.4). 
Is there a scripting interface allowing one to bypass the GUI as one gets proficient? 
Nice tip
Not now. But you can import your schema from graphql endpoint or from file! Editor will draw a diagram from it
This is a big thread so I didn't have time to read all of it... my Python experiences comes largely from my day job. I learned a lot on my own and I had ancillary skills (database design &amp; architecture) --- but the growth really came from combining these things and solving problems at work. I was paid to do it, which is good. And I also had nominal deadlines, which were also good. And at the end of the day, if I couldn't do something totally in Python, I used it to make certain parts of the task easier, which allowed me to make small things that weren't 'simple GUI weather scrapers'. So, for example, you do networking... what things suck (or otherwise are cumbersome to do?) and can you design something to make it go faster. The one thing that I will say in addition to that is that no matter what you develop, having a reasonably advanced understanding of databases is going to help a lot. I see a lot of projects hamstrung by poor data structure replete with redundancies, inefficiencies, etc. So perhaps if you framed say, scraping weather data as an example, as an exercise in something you're possibly not good at - normalization - you could improve that way and actually have a finished project. With 2 years of experience, I doubt you wouldn't be able to pull that off in a weekend. No GUI. Get something that runs in the background. Sports data, financial data, crypto data, whatever interests you . That was a bit rambly but hopefully there's something useful for you in there
It may help you more to see a councillor rather than a senior engineer. I am NOT saying there is anything wrong with you, but they are the specialists and professionals at solving the motivational issues you encounter. Engineers aren't.
Here's a place to get started: https://up-for-grabs.net/#/tags/python Pick a simple project and add one simple feature to it. That way you can easily add your own touch!
First, not to turn this into a counseling sesh, but let me just say that almost everyone ends up being limited by barriers they themselves create (in addition to the ones they don't), and that's especially true if you suffer from depression. When I look at your post, I see some evidence of that: * You want to work on a team project, but you think you're too green to work open source (despite 1700 hours with Python) * You want to collaborate with others, but coding with other people seems unfathomable ("it would change everything"). I think you are turning away good opportunities to work through the main challenge you face based on what you think they are rather than actually what they are. With that said, here's what I'd recommend: * Find a Python open source project that interests you -- that's key -- and fix their bugs. Why? Because reading other people's code is a great way to learn how to code well (or what avoid), it will force you to get in depth without worrying about being to green to build new code, and it will be a way to get a track record with that team. You don't have to make a big announcement about it: just grab a bug from their buglist, fix it, and commit it. * I'm largely self-taught, but that doesn't mean I didn't have mentors along the way, and likewise I've mentored other up-and-coming coders via Meetups. Python Meetups are not about "coding with a bud"; most are about more experienced coders mentoring the less experienced. You bring in your project, they help you with problems you are having, or they have meetings with presentations about Python. I don't think in general you are writing Python code with other people. * One your own projects, only you can tell why you lose interest, but one common issue with newer programmers is that they bite off more than they can chew. If your goal in these projects is merely to learn and have a gallery of projects for a potential employer, you really need to limit the scope of your project to just the tech you are trying to learn/demo. But my guess is that you might have enough already to start interviewing; I'm not sure most prospective employers need these to be finished gems, just explain to them why you created it, what you learned, what additional features you've considered adding. On this last point: early in my learning process I -- like I suspect a lot of new programmers -- wanted to create something amazing and great that people use (and maybe even pay real money for) on my own. It's natural and you can learn a lot doing that. But frankly, it's ultimately a trap to be avoided, since once other people start using your product, you often end up needing to support it. It's one thing if you are doing this as part of a team -- preferably on a job you are getting paid for -- but it's ultimately not fun doing it on your own. The Net is littered with the bones of open source projects that have been abandoned for this very reason.
Do you mean bad video or the video is not available to you?
why not xd
Grasshopper status. I've been there. The best thing to do is work with other people and do small projects to completion and iterate. If you're interested I have a project I'm working on that we might make open source at some point. Steemit for Bitcoin Cash. Only with possibilities for more currencies added over time.
Teach that vast knowledge of yours!
Python developers are in high demand but mainly through QA Test teams, Data Science, ML, and AI. As an interpreted language it's not ideal for building enterprise products though. That being said, many companies are pushing into Cloud technologies. Some use Python but for web front ends, Java and Javascript, PHP, GO are more suited. Really the language you choose depends on what direction or discipline you want to get into as well as the company's language adoption. Learning Python still builds a base coding foundation for any language. From here it's all semantics.
One of the core devs gave a talk about it at SciPy last year. You can see [the recording here](https://youtu.be/pP2_qDKUVLM).
You should always be looking to learn other languages no matter what. Not only will it keep your knowledge fresh and up-to-date, but you'll see different approaches to doing the same things... which leads to... The goal should be to understand programming *concepts* and when to use different languages and tools (what are the benefits/drawbacks in time, performance, and functionality for example). This will help you both in how you code in Python as well as your ability to find work. 
\*Opinion from someone who works as software developer for last 10 years. &amp;#x200B; Anyone who tells you that you need to have more than basic knowledge of one programming language to start your career is giving too much importance to language. For a beginner, I expect people to be logically thinking and knowing how to implement basic data structure and algorithms in their favored programming language. Good product based companies never stress you for knowledge in more than one programming language. All they ask you is your knowledge of data structures, algorithms and computer science fundamentals and above all your logical thinking. &amp;#x200B; Beyond that, you will get lot of opportunity to learn during work. Good luck!
That sounds very straight forward and inline with what I had myself envisioned. 
Superb
You should always be learning new languages. But you can definitely \*get started\* on a career path knowing only python.
pycache folder isn't expanded(arrow pointing horizontally indicates it's collapsed). I really really really don't get the point of this post. 
It may be simpler to launch it in a [Fargate](https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/) container instead of a VM. Looks like there is already a project to do that: https://github.com/uktrade/fargatespawner 
Post some of your projects, even if incomplete. Maybe someone will find your ideas interesting and will contribute to them with code and ideas to turn it into "something real", as you call it. 
[Here's your RFC](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2549)
What I’m hearing you say is that you need to go to PyCon to... investigate recruitment opportunities. And maybe pick up a few sessions - you know, just to get a feel for the kind of work you’re recruiting for. 😉
I've been contributing to [pgcli](https://github.com/dbcli/pgcli/) lately. I'm fairly new as well but the devs are pretty nice and attentive. I think the codebase needs a lot of work to be done yet it's not overly complicated. If you, like me, love the Python + Postgres combo, then it's a rewarding project to contribute to.
C# is interpreted, as is Java. Your comment "not suitable for enterprise" just because it's interpreted is BS.
I am a very satisfied user of [newreleases.io](https://newreleases.io). It's a big help to be automatically notified of new releases to the PyPi and GitHub software I use. And it's great that there are also notifications available for BitBucket, GitLab, Node.js NPM, etc. if I should need them.
interesting - i just studied RL - and i've been wanting to code up something for this. if this can be done with a gym-like format will be interesting for the RL community.
I'm finding it so easy to add a quick GUI front-end to some of my Python scripts with PySimpleGUI. There's so much less "boilerplate" needed than with more traditional GUI frameworks that I find myself adding simple GUIs to scripts which I would just run in console mode otherwise. Thanks to @MikeTheWatchGuy for making it available!
Hmm not sure if you'd be interested, I'm working on a webservice for an Android app that I'm trying to make. Although it's not going to pay, if you want to check it out my git handle is hpca01...
I think most people have your problem. They think about something, start doing it and then hit a wall. This wall is usually not a tall wall, but you have to go through a lot of stairs to cross it. You loose motivation and when you look to your side, you see a nice interesting new project with new fancy stuff to try. Easier said than done, but don't. Just finished what you started even if it is not the amazing thing you set up to do in the beginning. The wall that I talked above. Maybe it really is something that you cannot go through. Maybe because you can't get your head around it or just you cannot do what you wanted. This will happen! Go around it, find the closest thing and do instead. But do it and finish it. When it's done, post it here. You will see a lot of people doing this and getting a lot of great feedback. A lot of the process of learning new stuff is repeating easy things, but only doing that will NEVER get you anywhere. It will only make you start new projects. Be willing to loose hours before you fix something. It is where most of your time goes. Figuring shit! I found that using git with my projects, to get me organized, in branches and commits, really helped me commit - pardon the pun - to finish something.
There's no way you don't pick up more programming languages as you go, so if you're motivated, and familiar with data structures, jump in!
I've been working on a project that may be of interest to you: https://github.com/briancappello/flask-unchained If you'd prefer sticking with stock Flask, you're looking for the "application factory pattern". Should be quite a few examples if you google around :)
As a biginner this question may come off as very naive. But why don't I see conda mentioned more often? It's what I'm presently using to manage environments and works like a charm as far as I can see.
There is only one way to do it
Thanks a lot for that! It's actually a much better approach, I'll definitely take a look. Time to remove some dust off the Raspberry Pi :) 
That's what a task is, though. 
I've never written one by hand, I just use skeleton templates. the ZopeSkel set has always served me great. YMMV! 
Yes, that's whats supposed to be funny.
You should probably be using a units class. Something that holds the value and the unit, and has methods you can call to get that value in any unit. This will make your code more reliable by not having to have conversions everywhere, and not introducing another source of precision errors (or possibly worse) using the wrong unit and breaking a truck under the load.
Well yeah, I meant "compared to writing your whole app in C". Language interop is always tricky, but Python's C interop is really good, relatively speaking. :-)
Can you offer one for me? I’m interested in large desktop applications, preferably using PyQt or PySide2?
Holy moly, no one will see you as someone asking for handouts. Stop doing it alone, that's probably the WORST idea I can think of for programming.
From [README.md](https://README.md) &amp;#x200B; \&gt; Python generally lacks type checking, and that's a problem, a very annoying one. &amp;#x200B; PEP-484 and mypy would disagree!
Not too sure about applications, but Qt itself is spread pretty thin these days. You might want to try contributing to PySide, or maybe even to the core framework itself. 
Go with that then.
Use Sagemaker.
I'd look around the NumPy/SciPy stack then. There's lots of math heavy work there, and you can drop down to C/Fortran level if that sounds interesting to you. 
Thanks Will try
Thanks will try
If you've spent two years working with Python, you could find a junior position. 
It says an error with python27.dll and the project readme says python 2.7. Support for python 2.6 ended in 2013. Try using python 2.7
You don't need to write any code to do this. You can do it with find and grep. Something like this. find . -type f -name "*.pdr" | xargs grep "what you are searching for goes here" &amp;#x200B;
I've found that making reusable projects in new areas that are small and polished help me far more than large scale ambitious projects. I try to do larger projects with a team to keep me motivated.
This is how I learn things. It's pretty insane. Start a hundred different fires, hoping that it'll come out with something, but then you get bored and you move on. I've experienced three strangely memorable events in my life: 1. I was a child playing with legos, I'd build something, get bored, destroy it and build something else. At one point, I realized this was my habit and built something and said "This is finished" and never touched it again. 2. I wrote a lot of things, random tid bits. I even started a book or two. Got half way into something then quite. Finally, I told myself, you need a finished product, something to have. Put a self published novel together that was half finished, with everything. It did absolutely shit all, but proved it can be satisfying. 3. Still processing this, python and javascript. I started even more projects, but they were not exactly disparate. I realized what I craved was learning things, but wtf good is knowing things if it never produces anything tangible. Even if it's not for other people. I'm still building what I have, and I stop once in awhile, but no more tangents. I accept that I know enough to do what I seek, so I do it, instead of playing with random baubles. 4. I'm quite competent at billiards. I also like to drink. I find I'm not exactly all that interested in wining games, but 'showing off' and doing cool shit while mostly inebriated. All this has told me, I'm quite bored by doing what 95% of programming is done in the real world, and that's skin a database with a fancy crud to do mundane things with less effort. I like learning to the detriment of productivity.
How would i specify folder and can I do a "if found do this, if not found do this" spanning off of this? 
&lt;3 I will use you one day my pretty little CEF.
Well, it can be used to create a barebones wrapper around a website. 
Good luck :)
The . is the folder. . means current directory in \*NIX. You can change the . to any directory you like find /home/myuser/thedirectory ... Depending on the logic you want to do, you may have to at least write a bash script, or maybe use sed and/or awk.
You are ready to start applying. I would say don't even worry about finishing something. Usually I am all about people using projects to help sell themselves, but there is a lot that can be said about failed projects too. If you haven't 'spoken Python' with someone before, you will be in for a big surprise during your first phone interviews. "Well tell about the things you have worked on." "Well I wanted to do X so I used library Y but then ran into Z1, Z2, and Z3." "Did you try Z4?" "I did! and that's when I noticed that Z1 and Z2 were pointless. That was disheartening. It was like when I worked on A but only got as far as B because of C." Talking about your failures can be just as impressive as talking about your successes. Everyone can relate to the frustration of programming. What employers are looking for is not whether or not you get stuck, but how you look for help when you do. The fact that you've learned this much on your own shows your dedication. I would also say don't worry about not finding something to specialize in. That takes time and it's perfectly fine to try a variety of things -especially if you don't have as much experience yet. Whether you get a job or not, putting together your resume and going the through the interview process a couple of times will pay off dividends in letting you know just where you stand in relation to your goals and what you need to do next and there's nothing more motivating than that.
All this program is doing is taking a scanned barcode, assigning it as a variable, and searching in the PDR files within a static folder to see if the barcode string exists in one of them. It then needs to output a "safe to mail" or "Not safe to mail" based on if it is found or not. 
Yeah, just the fact that you've been doing it for 2 years alone is kinda nuts. Definitely need to collaborate and work with other people. Sometimes all you need is a fresh pair of eyes to make a world of difference.
&gt; I've never spoken a word in person to anyone on the subject of programming. With so many beggars, I just refuse to be that guy milking it and pissing people off looking for handouts. Learning when and how to ask for help is a life skill. Might as well start now.
&gt; My thoughts are to create a DB table per match. This will contain all of the details of each player in the match. The primary key from this table will be the secondary key for the match details table, which will store variables on the match, date , locations , outcome etc. This is a terrible design. The database schema should never be such that the normal application connection creates or drops tables, or otherwise manipulates the schema. As far as the application is concerned, it's all `SELECT`, `UPDATE`, `INSERT`, `DELETE`, nothing more. It's also terrible because now you cannot answer questions like "which games has this player been in" in pure SQL - you have to find all the game tables, and somehow iterate over them, but tables themselves aren't first-class in SQL, so you need to do it either in whatever scripting language the DBMS has on offer, or iterate in the host application. The canonical way of doing this is to create one table per type of entity (players, matches, teams). Each entity table has a primary key; usually this will be an auto-incrementing integer, but sometimes a natural primary key is available, or you have reasons to prefer UUID primary keys instead. Then you model many-to-one relationships by adding a suitable field to the table on the "many" side, with a foreign key constraint pointing to the primary key of the "one" side. E.g., a team has many players, but each player is a member of only one team at a time. So you could add a `team` field to the `players` table, with a foreign key from `players.team` to `teams.id`. Many-to-many relationships require additional tables, one for each relationship. For example, a player participates in many games, and each game has many players in it, so you can't use the simple foreign key approach. Instead, you create another table, often called a "bridge table" or "link table", let's call it `players_games`, that has two columns (`player` and `game`); both make up a compound primary key (which also makes the combo unique, so you can't add the same player to the same game twice, which is useful), and the `player` field has a foreign key to `players.id` while the `game` field references `games.id`. Sometimes, it makes sense to model one-to-many relationships with bridge tables too, e.g. when only a very small subset of rows will actually need to reference the other table. In such cases, you can build the bridge table just the same, but you add a UNIQUE constraint on the column that points to the "one" side; then only one row with that value can ever exist. As far as database choices go; SQLite is fine in principle, but doesn't do a lot in terms of type safety - you can create an integer column and happily insert strings, and it won't bark at you for it. If you want a free DBMS that takes data integrity seriously, I'd recommend PostgreSQL. Among open source databases, it's like the gold standard. However, if you're going to find online storage, you will often see that MySQL is your only option.
Well brilliant might be the wrong word. You could be but I don't know. The right word is dedicated. Two years and such a diverse set of projects is nothing to be taken lightly. You're doing the right thing by looking for bigger and better projects. Don't give up.
I feel like this is a much smaller issue than most people make it out to be. Lots of languages suffer the same problem and it is quite manageable without an amount of effort that causes a disruption. Especially managing the various shells or handling an environment once loaded, wow - how nit picky do you have to be to consider typing exit (instead of the longer, more annoying deactivate) to be a big issue. All in all - yes I want better python tools. But, I don't have any issue working with what exists and I don't generally run into any problem that can't be fixed with a few moments of "wait, what did I just do" and potentially a quick google query.
Unclear &gt; I've never spoken a word in person to anyone on the subject of programming. With so many beggars, I just refuse to be that guy milking it and pissing people off looking for handouts. &gt; So, I get hours and hours deep into a project and just end up spinning my wheels for dozens of hours until something else catches my interest. And repeat. You are spinning your wheels because you need help, but refuse to ask for help. How do you on car trips when you get lost and don't want to ask for directions?
Also you can just launch an EC2 instance from amazons supplied machine-learning images which include everything you need pre-installed and configured.
What I look for in a junior engineer: 1) Understands source control 2) Grasps basics of object oriented software 3) Communicates well 4) asks questions early (I'd guess this might be your weak point) That is it. In the professional world, you very frequently will end up working with something that is company IP, and will be unique to that company. You won't know how to work with it, until you see the company's (often terrible) documentation. For the most part I expect to have to mold you into the shape i want you to be. So if you know python and you know it broadly, thats pretty good qualification for a junior position. It might help you to have experience with another language to give you some contrasting knowledge against python. I personally work professionally in both python and ruby routinely, but I've also done javascript, elixir, java, C, Perl5. (remember 15+ year career, i've had time, plus some of these were at Uni) You could do some ruby, just to see how a language in a similar space does things. Or you could do some haskell, to see how completely different programming can be. I wouldn't go too deep on either, i'd do a relatively simple problem that you know how to solve in python and then learn enough of another language to implement a solution as well. But this is all bonus point stuff. You are probably ready.
Should I even dignify that ignorant comment with a response?
Well, first of all, I am a man and real men don't ask for directions (JOKES lol). But you're completely right. It's ridiculous. But in my defense the culture can be a little bit abrasive. Just trying to get help on stack overflow when I didn't know the exact words to put to my issues always got me a few comments of condescension along with that infamous duplicate tag. And, thinking about it, I have reached out for help in the past. And I have been flat will you turn down. Which I completely understand, people are busy and don't have time for charity. I guess I just need to learn where to find the people that will be most willing. I think if it were me, I would be more than happy to help as much as I can especially from where I come from. I'm sure there are many out there like me, I just need to find them.
Thanks for dropping the headphone jack, Apple!
&gt; I've never spoken a word in person to anyone on the subject of programming. With so many beggars, I just refuse to be that guy milking it and pissing people off looking for handouts. You should think really, really hard about that sentence. Do you really think that the majority of people getting out there, meeting people with similar interests, drinking coffee together and talking about their projects and dreams are *looking for handouts*? That's a very black and white view of human social engagement, and I would argue it is not only wrong, but harmful. One of the great joys in life is sharing your interests with other people. Encouraging other people. And, yes, helping people out when you get the chance to. People LIKE to help other people out (or, most of them do). It's not a handout, it's supporting each other for the mutual benefit of the whole culture. You should talk to people about your interests, and squash the attitude that there is something wrong with doing so.
I've been coding for about 20 years. I've been working in Python for over half of that. I can count the number of personal projects I've finished on one hand. Most of those weren't even 'personal growth' projects. They were things I did because I something was annoying me and I decided to fix it. Now, I've finished lots of projects... for companies. This isn't unusual! I know lots of devs who go to work, code, and then come home and do other things. They don't have side-gigs or pet projects, and tend to do their learning on the job rather than over the weekend if they can help it. Also, what you're trying to do is several things. Besides coding, you're probably trying to design, architect, and manage a project. Those skills are specialized, and not everyone has them. Lord knows I can't design, and most devs I know can't manage timelines that aren't driven by someone else. Finishing things in a company is way easier because you have people picking up the tasks you're weak in.
Indeed I never do that, I create a virtualenv and call its binary using the path. It's always just a few lines in a makefile anyways. 
Meta data wiping application.
Well thank you for your warm and insightful reply. You must be great to work with.
I'm talking conceptually. In a job scenario, there's a business case for a project with a direct function. It needs to do a specific thing. i.e. A web portal needs to allow employees to login and log certain data. Creating my own projects has plagued me with deciding what features I should implement, not implement, which ones are essential and which ones aren't. You don't have that issue in business to that extent. Obviously, there are ridiculous expectations from management sometimes, but you are never lost. 
Without knowing how you want to _optimise_ your application, the way to normalise would be: a table of players, a table of matches, a link table that says which players are in which match. Sqlite is perfectly fine unless you want to handle concurrent writes (simultaneous updates). It's particularly good at that. I'm not really seeing a reason why you'd need this for traditional sports, but some busy esport game might need it.
Thanks, I'll check this out! &amp;#x200B;
Hi this is my first real contribution to this sub after lurking here for a month or so. Just like you I'm new to programming, with much less time under my belt even. I started learning python about 3 months ago through Coursera and other web guides. My initial goal was just to build a simple application for my wife which could compare the unit price between similar items at different grocery stores. Learning was tough and I was tempted to quit a few times but I stuck at it. I'm happy to say that I met my initial goal and so much more. I made applications for everything. A fantasy league stat tracker for my friends, an Excel sheet merger for my boss to save him half hour a day, a deal tracker so my aunt would know when items she's interested in were on sale. Just little things that could make the people around me happy . Once I discovered data mining and analysis there was no going back. I found what I was in love with, and now I'm working on other applications which I have been contracted to make. (Best side hustle ever) Now I've nowhere near the experience that you have under your belt so I can understand if your a bit jaded but maybe you could just try to remember why it was that you got into python the first place and rediscover your love for it through that. Just thought I'd share my experience with you. Wish you all the best in the future I
This is down right pathetic. People love to give answers on Stack overflow for karma.
I just developed an app for work that exposes multiple apis for other apps to talk to, this is the guide I followed: https://medium.freecodecamp.org/structuring-a-flask-restplus-web-service-for-production-builds-c2ec676de563
That would help with getting the function names for sure, what about returning the entire function? Editors like pycharm have the ability to parse and identify the beginning and end of a function (for collapsing) so I know such a framework exists, I doubted that it's opensource though.
I rarely if ever get personal projects to "finished" or even "working" they tend to be jumping off points for exploration for me. &amp;#x200B; Even at work, when we are forced to ship, the coder is never done, just "good enough for now" &amp;#x200B; Most software jobs are not going to be looking for what have you completed, but instead, are you interested in solving problems &amp; developing software. And are you comfortable with your tools and languages.
Need to see the rest of the code
What's your favorite project you've worked on? Share it with me and I'll try to finish it up for you
Look for Junior Engineer roles, apply and see how far you get. There is nothing wrong with testing the market, if you don't get anything move on with other entry roles in the field.
It works! Thank you very much.
You can develop a package, but releasing versions every few days for months on end is a break neck pace. How often do you update your dependencies? I do it about once every 6 months. How many major versions of the software have been released over that time? I don't want to make changes to my code to support your package so frequently.
Look around at job postings and see what they are looking for. If you really been studying such a wide variety of topics I'm sure you'll have some relevant experience. you don't have to know everything they list but if you feel like you don't have enough experience, try to choose an area to focus on. For example if you want to work on web apps, you need to know how HTTP works, web servers, API design, etc.
Check out /r/learnpython
Not exactly python but I would also lose interest in things that only weeks earlier I was intensely interested in. I'd also never finish what I started, until I got diagnosed with ADD and given adderall.
Sure will have a look, can it be attached to a micro instance or ?
find … | xargs grep thing &amp;&amp; echo "safe to mail"
could try f = open(user_input + os.sep + fname, 'rb', encoding='UTF8')
Before we locked down permissions, we had to find and kill all the random hosts that were started this way by our data science folks because they don't understand that offering a python interpreter via an HTTP server on public internet is how you compromise yourself, your business, and your customers. Don't put anything on a host like this that you want to keep private. 
&gt;&gt;I've been learning entirely on my own. That's your problem. &gt;&gt;I need to be on a team dedicated and driven toward building something. That's your solution.
I like Pipenv: It simplifies environment-management by combining dependencies and virtualenvs in a simple CLI. Can't compare to Poetry, but an improvement over using Pip and virtualenv separately, and doesn't introduce the concept of two sep package managers like Conda does.
&gt; I found only one other (really good) project for this: https://github.com/andreacensi/contracts And what do you offer that motivates a new project?
Try this. Python for nuclear reactor kinetics. If you want your brain fucked, this is for you. &amp;#x200B; [http://conference.scipy.org/proceedings/scipy2015/pdfs/kathryn\_huff.pdf](http://conference.scipy.org/proceedings/scipy2015/pdfs/kathryn_huff.pdf)
Agreed
Good luck with your beginnings pal.
This has been a hard-learned lesson for me due to how I was raised. I rarely (almost never) asked professors or even friends for help in college for fear of asking the wrong question and sounding dumb. Looking back, I worked way harder than I should have and learned way less than I could have. So... I sympathize with the OP. But I also agree with everything here. Make mistakes, ask dumb questions, bother people, and freaking learn. There's another side to this: if you're asking someone for help with a problem, you are most likely reinforcing or building their knowledge through having them explain it (the Feynman learning technique).
I'm starting the dictionary and sets chapter of fluent python. little bit difficult of a read after python crash course.
A solid amount of tracing through other programs and research papers to figure out a bottleneck, and make it easier to replicate/implement a better solution for a pipeline. Also got nerd snipped by a post saying there's a block of accounts all run by the same person, and I want to see if I can make it statistically believable rather than just anecdotally reasonable.
I don't see "can implement a red-black tree" on your list. The damn over-the-top algorithm interview horror stories I've heard have put me off applying to dev jobs.
Yes really, just use SageMaker and save yourself the headache. That's what our team is doing.
Don't be afraid to ask questions. Python is a language with its own community. If you speak the language (learn the basics) then you will receive a lot of help. Freenode IRC is a good place to meet, share, and even help other people to gain better experience. If ya had some friends in discord all talking, working on different projects maybe helpful and fun for you. If __main__ == '__name__' Pythonrules()
I've been dragged to a few meetups/hackathons myself, and you have no reason to hesitate. From what I read in your post, you probably have more knowledge about python than at least 30% of the people there. I think you're selling yourself short. Foundational knowledge is such a fundamental aspect of programming, it can be easy to forget how much you know. For example, if you've touched web development /scraping, you have an understanding of client-server architecture. Programming tends to be more about knowing enough to FIND the answer, than knowing the answer. Your breadth of knowledge will lend itself to finding a lot of answers to a lot of questions. Hell, I'm a full stack developer, and I would say I look at python stdlib docs at LEAST once a day.
I got you point about my stupid example, but you think that post was all about measurement?

Have you tried getting a job utilizing python?
Udemy has a number of python courses that have you build your own pen testing tools from scratch. They also have courses for building real-world application like block-chain and database driven web applications. You just missed a Black Friday sale where all courses were 95% off, but they may have that sale again somewhere in the future.
I hope you're not having to use PIC assembly! :-)
Start coding Go
Eh. That sounds harsh and hard. The irc channels for the various projects and python itself are very welcoming. That being said, I wouldn't expect much to change off the bat. It's pretty difficult to agree on a project and a vision and then to actually work together. I've kept myself sane by building stuff I knew I wanted to have or at least explore. Probably more than half my projects are not fit for anything but a virtual bin, but I learned from them. So that's my advice: only build stuff you really really want. &gt;Networking particularly has been my focus. It's been where I've put most of my work in. But I've been ALL over. would you be interested in writing open source multiplayer code with me?
i want to say you need some bluetooth but honestly using that is probably going to kind of present you with the end-run option of just using bluetooth headphones. &amp;#x200B; which are really inexpensive these days. i think my personal set was maybe $18. 
Scarcity of available variants. Different API. 
&gt; I've been learning entirely on my own. I can honestly say I've received zero assistance apart from help on minor bugs. I've never spoken a word in person to anyone on the subject of programming.With so many beggars, I just refuse to be that guy milking it and pissing people off looking for handouts. This is an awful way to look at a community of people trying to learn and/or help out others. Cutting yourself off from help is also a surefire way to fail. &gt; I refuse to settle for some simple GUI app that scrapes weather data This is like trying to play Hendrix before you've learned any scales. People don't do these things because it's a need, they do it because it's a step toward a goal in the distance. No project is beneath you, or me, or anyone else.
You can pass to grep filenames to search within. That plus wildcards expansion give a shorter version: grep "what you are searching for goes here" * 
Book marked, thank you!
Nice job!
I don't own the code, unofrtunately. Can you make a guess based on what I showed? It's the only bit of the API code that concerns Asyncio.

If you are not finishing projects perhaps you should try to approach them in an agile manner, try to deliver a fully functional project every other week. The key is to start with a small scope and grow the app incrementally. Another thing that might ease your mind looking for help is that people love to help, what they hate is lazy questions, but what is a lazy question? Usually, the person wants someone to do the work for them or they have done zero research. Questions like "hey guys, I am trying x and y is happening, which is weird because I read in z that w should happen instead" are quite pleasing to answer. Another suggestion is that you do a project to solve a real life problem you might have (I once did a project that migrated data from google sheets to trello, it took me an afternoon but it was very pleasing to have a useful project completed this fast, no need for a gui or a cli... Just a plain can solve personal or business problems)
Well, I'm not at a big company. And I'm a director, so I get to decide how I do things. I have done those sorts of questions before I learned better. I try to stay away form that sort of thing because it tests more for an academic background than for useful development skill.
besides this, https://io.made.com/ i doubt you will find anything in blog post form. might try looking at source code maybe?

you need a problem to solve.
&gt; I just can't finish a damn project. I've been learning entirely on my own. I can honestly say I've received zero assistance apart from help on minor bugs. I also struggle with finishing side projects. One thing that might help is deciding what "done" means for a project. That can sometimes help with setting larger goals which can then be broken down into tasks that are small enough for their own feature branches.
If you've been working two years you are not green. Ignore your inner doubt. The thing you lack is knowing how to work with, learn from, and teach others. To get to next level its time to collaborate. Get over your fears and doubts.
A few comments: First of all, it's not technically incorrect, but you only have to convert your barcode input to a string once. Fortunately, Python probably optimizes the extra ones out. Second, you might come across a file in your target directory that's not, in fact, a Unicode text file. When you tell Python it is a Unicode text file (with that open statement), and it then tries to read the file and convert it, you get your error. I'd recommend you wrap that in a try-except block to catch the Unicode exception. Third, you do a f.read() twice. The first time, you get the contents of the file. The second time, you get nothing, because you already read the entire file, and there's nothing left. So that second test likely always sets safeToShip to False. Fourth, you're setting yourself up for errors with the way you set safeToShip. If you're not careful, you'll keep looking after finding the right file, and since the next file won't have the barcode, you'll end up reporting that every package isn't safe to ship. The only time this will work is if the correct file is the last one looked at. Here's a better loop to use: safeToShip = False for fname in directory: if os.path.isfile(user_input + os.sep + fname): with open(user_input + os.sep + fname, 'r', encoding='UTF8') as f: try: safeToShip = searchstring in f.read() if safeToShip: break except UnicodeDecodeError: print('Warning: file not Unicode: ' + fname) 
Yup. This plus any decent IDE and you'll see these any typing issues show up immediately.
I'd guess OP is trying to do this on Windows: user_input = "W:/"
same boat. i'd do the fun 'meat' part of a project, then lose interest. meds will make you see it through.
Thank you so much!
It is trivial these days to get a bash prompt on windows.
The raw truth, for real. I appreciate it brother. I definitely need to hear that because it's absolutely nothing but fear, and no good comes from that. Thanks again, appreciate it big time
find yourself a local python user group and be social.
Get a job in Python development? Beware though that CRUD apps with fancy UIs are pretty much the majority of the jobs in IT. But still, you'd learn plenty of things about software development instead of just programming and that's worth gold IMO
It really is as simple as that. Got to get out outside of my comfort zone.
Oh trust me brother, I've used Adderall to its full advantage Lol. I've heard a lot of the computer science community takes it, is that just a myth? Seems pretty easy to believe, it's a miracle drug when it comes to this type of work.
probably. i have asperger's and adhd, so mine is legit. never used adderall, but we have biphentin here in canada. not an amphetamine and slow release. it's a godsend.
1. Read. Comment on other peoples github, and read their comments to each other on pull requests. 2. Complete something, it can be stupid and small, but always complete something.
That is precisely, exactly it. I'm surprised you're the first to say it out right. Earlier on I used web scraping and selenium to pull resumes off of job boards as an IT recruiter. It was marginally helpful. Most of the projects I worked on have been aimed at solving relatively large problems that were likely either not viable or outside of my skill set. My latest project was indexing the stack overflow Data dump in order to have more targeted searches most relevant A given issue at hand. I got a lot of good feedback on the idea, but that type of initiative, I soon learned, is a lot more involved and quickly became more than I could handle. I haven't given up on it, but I definitely would need guidance on it if I were to continue
Biphentin. Hmm. I'm going to ask my doctor about that absolutely. Adderall is great, but there are definitely side effects so something definitely worth looking into. Thanks for the heads up on that!
Is that an offer? Then my answer is a resounding yes! How should we connect?
Thanks for this, seriously. I know I have learned so much, but I let destructive thoughts get in the way that say otherwise. And the part about being able to know where to look to just find the answer being half the battle speaks volumes. It's definitely UV most hardest parts when starting out as a developer. The learning curve is unreal and wants you're over that hurdle,developing becomes progressively less frustrating. Thanks again, man. I do appreciate it

I'm in the exact same position friend. It's tiresome.
You're not wrong. It also happens to be one hell of a struggle for me, and I think a lot of people. It's a very different dynamic for me, so that doesn't help. But I'm getting there. I come from a background of frat parties and mindless sales jobs. Then I decided to grow up and wanted to actually do something with my life which is why I started programming. Integrate into the dev culture is a bit more difficult than I thought. But it's all on me, no one else is responsible for that. 
Glad I could help! Good luck with your future endeavors as a super dope python developer
Seems like PyData would be in his interest too. 
I think there's a lot of people that are in our situation. I've thought before about starting some sort of community for people like us. I mean, it just makes sense. I'm going to get on discord and I'll start a group, do you have an account? I'll shoot you an invite if you do and we can talk a bit about what we both have going on and where our struggles are. 
Which difference with Figlet?
No, I got your point about the new syntax being more robust than using anonymous default values and guessing, or using **kwargs and writing your own checker.
That sounds like a good starting point on the surface, though that doesn't appear to be our weaknesses haha. My name on there is the same: thenicknash.
Get on zulip chat, and try to contribute to a project. It sounds like you are insane, and you should put that to use. You could do that by helping better a tool to help others talk and use python.
&gt; is that doable with just mastery of python it depends. For full-stack development, Python tools to do python-only web development are not quite up to industry standard, leaving you to using something like Flask thus needing to know js/css/html. But these days, Python is just a tool: what is more important is having a skill base like Data Science, Machine Learning or Big Data.
This is awesome. I’m going to share this with my Computational Linguistics professor today!
&gt; This is a basic question. It's asking how to write maths in code, and how to write what may be one line of matplotlib. Hmm... so I read it as plotting a function that produced a complex number (of the form x + yi) this means you have a 2-d input and for each point a 2-d output the quesiton of how to correctly visualize this then becomes complicated. That question (though quite domain-specific) feels like it might be releavant on r/python rather than r/learnpython. I may, however, have spent too much time thinking about mathematics..
I agree, though from the stackstrace, looks like op is on windows
True, but it makes it a lot easier when you're around a group of people who are on the same boat. Sounds good, I'll add you
Yep, it's available on the free-tier micros. The one I used includes pre-configured virtual environments for various backends (TF, TF-GPU, Theanu etc).
As I said in another reply, you can easily get a bash prompt on Windows these days.
100% agreed. about 11 years ago I went to my first conference (for a totally different open source project). There, I met a few of the core developers on the project at a casual social meetup and they spoke to me like I was an equal. I learned a bunch, but more importantly I became energized. Every time I would go to a gathering, no matter how big or small, I would get that momentum back to USE what I'd learned. Now, whenever I feel disconnected or like I'm spinning wheels.. I go to a con.
The difference is that my program is worse in terms of features... Honestly, when I started working on this project, I didn't look at analogs, I just wanted to make a program that generates such text. The project is made for training, it is much easier than Figlet. Thanks for the link, I'll look at the implementation, the pictures with the results look interesting.
&gt; WARNING: If you are creating very large grids, it will slow down from displaying numbers. The lesson here is calculating a result is not always the best way. Saving the first 78k primes as a constant in your program would have added ~314kB to your script size ... inconsequential for today's computers. Even old school programs and modern embedded systems use lookup tables for things like sine calculations instead of doing the math. 
Thanks will try
Finishing a project will go far in helping you feel satisfied, and it’ll also likely be the single biggest item that gets you positive traction when looking for a job. In most industries, ideas are a dime a dozen, but especially so in programming businesses. Anyone can sketch out an idea and get rolling on some partial project to start working on it, but never do anything else with it. But actually finishing a project, even a simple one, is what really impresses an employer. They know this person can get from A to B, and that’s huge. And it’ll also be satisfying for your mind, to see that you set a specific goal and accomplished it. Even if it was a simple GUI meant to scrape some weather details. Make it do what it was supposed to do, and that’s a success. It sounds like you’ve got a bunch of partial projects covering a wide variety of topics, and that’s great, just start finishing some of them up. Good luck dude, I hope you keep with it.
Possibly a dumb question, but is it possible to contribute to projects like NumPy? It seems like something that is been around for a while and is widely used. I thought you people only contributed to small projects that are relatively new?
It's absolutely possible - in fact, many of the key infrastructure project that seem to have always been around are actually pretty critically understaffed!
hey thanks for this man. I am insane. First time I've thought of that in a good way thanks to you lol. Checking that out very shortly.
CRM's are such bespoke things, that usually it's just easier to write your own, you get what you want and you don't need to monitor the original package for breaking changes. Plus it makes it easy to extend as business demands grow. If your going to be maintaining it for more than 6 months (or will involve more than a few departments of one business) , it's usually always best to take this stance. If taking this route, don't use too many 3rd party packages, keep as much code as vanilla as possible. Clients always want 'extra features' and when extending an open source package, there are nearly always roadblocks. I write and maintain CRM's for a living and some that I wrote over 5 years ago have had no real base changes to them. I use the pyramid framework and have had to barely change any of my original code from when it was first written, simply extended as and when business requirements change. 
I don't have any advice to offer, but know you aren't the only one feeling this way. I've been learning web development for about two years now (completely on my own), and started working in python/django about a year ago. Building fake projects noone will ever use has always felt like a waste of time to me. I know it's necessary to do so to build experience/portfolio, but unfortunately that doesn't help with motivation. &amp;#x200B; Earlier this year I managed to land a fairly large project that lasted about 7-8 months. I learned a great deal, but made very little and almost ended up getting evicted. It was my hope that gig would be enough to land me my next job. So far no luck at all (freelance or otherwise). &amp;#x200B; People always say, "go out and meet other devs! get involved!". This has been a struggle for me as well. I'm not at all the type of person that would typically go out to meet strangers. In addition to that, I feel I come from a different background than most people in this industry. I've spent most of the last 10 years working in kitchens and fixing motorcycles in my spare time. The modern office environment is completely foreign to me. &amp;#x200B; I feel as you do, that the path forward would involve working on a team. I guess it's a matter of somehow finding the right team. &amp;#x200B; Not really sure where I'm going with this, but I guess just know you aren't the only one going it alone and feeling like hanging it up. 
Thats why deep down I know I just can't. Kinda feel like a pussy for sounding like a crybaby here, but i just hit the aspiring programers "rock bottom" -- had to do something. And I'm damn glad I did. The support from all of you blows me away. I've only experienced the opposite to this point. thanks man.
Every programmer gets here. But it's a good thing, especially if you keep going. I'm glad to see you getting so much support. When you look back at this, you'll see just how far you've come and won't regret it. Best of luck!
But a problem the python community can assist with -- which they have, immensely. It is a gener progrmming problem. But Most people like me are starting with python. Neither here nor there, just glad i posted it here. Highly doubt I would have got this response from a general /r/compsci subreddit. but maybe. who knows.

Lol. You mean for Rep (read: ego points) It's basically "let me give you a condescending answer, treat you likeyou dont belong here, only because I get rep points." And that's IF the question isn't market "duplicate" -- i resent that site. It's filled with self-loving jerks. Not all, But I don't think I've ever had a positive experience. &amp;#x200B;
Biphentin. Hmm. I'm going to ask my doctor about that absolutely. Adderall is great, but there are definitely side effects so something definitely worth looking into. Thanks for the heads up on that!
I'd be interested in a link to their research, if you could PM me / feel comfortable sharing.
Thanks brotha! &amp;#x200B;
?
I most def will, thanks!
Sup, I think you'll need to be more specific what you mean by linkage. Taking the most general case, I'd say use Numpy and impliment the physics equations with vectors. I think SimPy has some of that. 
First post in that subreddit is this same link, post by user pipenv_sucks. You can't deny he (Kenneth) had a little bit of a point.
I don't say this harshly, but you are WRONG. I had so many fights on SO Meta regarding doing more fo the beginners. Without exception, ever post bitches about how many people beg for help. And this is on a site built to help. It Is asking for a handout, time is money. And I have asked for help, by the way. Multiple times -- and been absolutely shut down.
The biblical truth. For real, def what I need.
Hard agree, those forums seem at least 80% ego driven. Some of the subs here can be the same way.
Online? Lol you should see some of the berating I've received on Stack Overflow after ever queston got marked duplicate, when it wasn't. as it usually the case. It is a life skill. But the \*online\* dev community is filled with toxic, unbecoming people. They drown out the good ones out there, like the ones on this thread.
Dropping it for what? Driving Uber? You've been writing apps for yourself for 2 years? How is this even possible? You should have gotten a job as a junior dev exactly 2 years ago.
I'd hardly say one user represents everyone. KR even says this about /r/python not representing the entire Python community in his letters and recent Real Python interview. I don't know the guy, nor do I know much about this situation, but from what I've read he seems to have focussed on the few people actually hating on him (who were largely downvoted) and is deliberately ignoring the useful discussion that came out of it. There's no denying he makes great stuff, requests is awesome, pipenv solves problems for some people. It's just a shame that he feels the need to hang onto the hatred he got rather than trying to address the discussion further. Feel like I'm rambling now so I'll stop Regarding /r/positivepython KR seems to have used it as an "I'm Kenneth Reitz sub" as he's posted a link to an album he made which clearly has no connection to Python.
you don't understand, and by no means should you. I was a frat boy and "airhead" sales jag for years. 2 years ago I wantd to start using my brain. Do something. Create. It's a primitive need in humans. I didn't grow up around the computer enthusiasts. The opposite. I grew up around jocks and frat-douchers. I played sports, I partied and chased chicks. I'm extremely extroverted and some take it as arrogance, when it;s just my humor. I did and do not fit the typical mold. I live in a separate world from you guys. I don't speak your language the way your used to. Many other social factors take a role doenst make it imposible, but very hard. People look at me as developers and wouldn't come close to guessing programming excites me more than anything, (except football). My point is that I didn;t just choose to do it this way. I was just clueless how to do it differntly. I just figured once I Publish that app that's super dope, THEN I'll fit it. I'm **just now** learning the fallacy hat is that type of thought process 
Go on Reddit, Freenode #python, or one of the various Discord servers. SO suffers from problems w/ vision and purpose, which manifests in some toxicity.
Didn't knew about mypy. Seems very cool to me. But, it doesn't give the user with the possibility to add more complex constraints (like argument size, shape, or some range of allowed values) on function/method arguments, whilist packages like the above mentioned `Contracts` project, or my `PyContracts` can. Anyway, really thank you for pointing me towards the `mypy` package!
Ohhhhhh boy lol. See, this is my problem. The projects I've chosen to work on are year long projects. I downloaded 400GB of Stack overflows data dump. I wanted to help newbies like me by creating a search engine that helped target their questions as efficiently as possible. it's such a huge barrier as a beginner. I have pages and pages of notes on the conceptual design. I started by migrating the data into a database. I broke down a "question" into categories of context (Issue, error, clarification, Code error, and MANY more). I used those categories to then build an index based on the posts, comments, tags, accepted answers, etc. Sentiment analysis was part of the architecture as well. But then there's the user end. You have ot make it easy. You have to allow the user to be able to farily easily input all necessary information on their question in a way that would pull a list of results closest to what they're looking for. That is another project itself. I didn;t have the foresite to see this coming. And is an example of how i got here and why this post happened, &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
I think programmers are going to end up being supported by some enormously clever tools, but actual replacement is going to require a general purpose AI which isn't going to happen any time soon.
No until AI takes over and we all don't have jobs because of it, programming will still be needed and a high paying job
I did not know (using `poetry`, btw). But I mean that if in the future I could just install an official/recommended Python packaging tool on my system like for example NPM for JavaScript, I would be happy. The exact implementation details are not that important if it works perfectly.
Load of rubbish. IT ecosystem is only growing. There is a shortage of developers world wide and it pays well. Get into it an you can climb to good pay fast if you are any good.
And then everything changed, I bet. lol. Adderal is an absolute godsend.
&gt; I have seen multiple people saying that programming will eventually become 'useless' and it won't be worth it putting a substantial amount of effort into it. I've never heard that. Who says that? It may not be viable as a profession for most people but that does not make it useless. Kinda like you learned to write. Even though your chance of becoming a professional author is small writing is an extremely useful skill in all facets of like. Same for programming; you will find a use for it no matter what you do. 
I run my own It recruitment firm. 
if you're in the US, you're out of luck with biphentin i think.
"community driven" my ass. It' a cover for the fact they know it's everything but. Except maybe for the elites. It's a community circlejerk for them
You're asking the wrong people. Sorry, as I'm not trying to sound harsh either, but anyone who bashes a beginner asking for help is a out of their fucking mind.
You still need to install packages in micro services, no? Or what do you mean exactly?
You should post on r/learnmachinelearning
What in the patterns surprise you? That only every second column contains primes (except on the first row)? That every fifth column don't contain primes (except on the first row)?
Required link: https://xkcd.com/927/ :)
Because age of micro services does not mean you won’t use anything that’s not a micro service. It’s a completely different topic you’re touching, IMHO.
I'm doing some commercial testing carts with Raspberry Pi. What is great with Python is that I have my custom hardware I2C and GPIO being driving by Python. 3 back end server processes linked with pipes and 1 Flask web server for UI and WebServices. I can have this all in one project, rather than needed other languages to drive hardware. It works really well. I can toggle I/O at about 40-50 KHz. Not anywhere close to speed you can get with C. But it is more than fast enough for what I'm doing.
I don't really notice much of a pattern. I'm more asking if anyone else does.
The speed of generating the primes is actually not the problem. If you notice, you can create a list of a million primes in under a second. The reason it slows down from displaying numbers is because of putting numbers on the grid itself.
You sound delusional.
You chose a problem that Google works on, except not just for stack overflow questions. Definitely an inspiring problem and I see why you chose it. I'm confused by the index you built. I'm not sure how you wanted to classify new questions, perhaps using some kind of algorithm that relates new questions to the categorically labelled dataset you created. Machine learning could handle generating new labels/categories of context for brand new questions if you already manually labelled much of the data dump. And then, you could simply display results on a scrolling widget queried directly from the database, the algorithm's output being indices corresponding to the correct data dump questions. With this the user end can be an afterthought in the first iteration, for now could you clarify what the data looks like? What did you add to the database you downloaded?
It's possible but unlikely. Knowing how to talk to a computer will become increasingly important is my guess. Perhaps it won't be Python everyone use 20 years from now, or even a currently existing language. But the principles will still be there. I'd put programming, math and logic at the top of what's 'useful' to study. &amp;#x200B;
No time developing a skill is ever wasted. Even if the exact skill becomes obsolete you will have developed many other skills and habits that will help you elsewhere.
Don't know if you meant to post it on this thread. But assuming you did: You sound like a fucking prick. Just being honest. No reason for what you just posted. None. Have a good day.
The ‘hacking’ books are a waste of time. If you don’t know the language well enough, you won’t be able to spin up a python script for anything on the fly. Learn the language first. At the same time, learn the methodology of hacking tools and create a vm lab using them. The main book on metasploit is good for network hacking, as well as the Web Applicatiok Hackers Handbook for web stuff.
The [Ulam spiral](https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulams_spiral) is more interesting. There you can see unexpected lines.
I seriously doubt it. A Software Developer's job may change, but ultimately SW development is a creative endevor which will be difficult for an AI to take over. Even if computers do take over the "programming" aspects of the job devs will still need to understand how software logic works in order to make good high level decisions about how to solve problems. 
Gladly not, just plain old C. 😅
Programming will probably be amongst the last jobs to disappear the closer we get to AGI.
Well, I expected more concrete facts like whole Python binary dist is about 30Mb but Lua takes roughly 200kb or something about learning curve. From my point of view all valuable pros and cons are nothing in comparison with size of community. Obviously, Python community is much large that Lua's one. But I am wondered why JavaScript is not so popular in embedded systems. 
I teach programming for a living, so I've certainly encountered people in comparable situations. I think you're underestimating the diversity of experiences that lead to programming as an interest and profession, and overestimating people's tendency to reject others without the same background. It's true that there are some judgemental people that have stupid opinions about people with certain backgrounds, but they are pretty rare, and not worth worrying about if you can help it. Good on you for following your interests. I think you'll have a lot of good experiences if you take that enthusiasm into the programming scene. If anyone judges you, they're an asshole.
That’s cool, but personally I’d rather have compiled code for stuff like this. Interpreted languages have the nasty habit of hiding bugs more easily. With compiled code, more of that gets caught before the code is rolled out to do its important task. But then, maybe I’m just paranoid. 
Thank you for your review! I'm always very happy to hear a feedback from our users, especially if it's such a positive as yours. This was exactly our idea. We didn't want to focus only on one service for providing packages, but to support as much as possible. For now we support 10 different platforms and probably we will add more over time, and maybe even more notification methods. 🙂
Well thank you for being a sane Tech manager in a sea of insanity
I think you may be misunderstanding, the Python code was just used to reproduce and confirm the results that the state came to, as a third party check. One of the candidates complained that ranked choice voting is a "black box" (meaning no one can verify the results, because no one knows how the machine works). So the individual in this article wrote some Python code that took the raw data from the state, did the math, and displayed the results of the election. His results matched the results from the official election computers, showing that the results of ranked choice voting are just simple math, and not some voodoo that no one understands. The actual election did not use Python (that we know of).
Hella cool, thanks very much for this
You are correct, I miss understood. That’ll teach my dumb ass to only skim an article. 
+1 The [jeopardy questions database](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwT5wj_P7BKXb2hfM3d2RHU1ckE/view?usp=sharing) alone is a pretty cool find! I'm gonna use this to make a trivia-day-calendar for android home screen. 200,000 questions I can pretty much put up a random question every hour and not run out. 
I see so its better to learn one language at the time while i master it right? Also what books you recommend for python ? Im a beginner
Yeah, I can see that viewpoint for sure. Although, it's really PyPA who arguable failed to properly evaluate a tool they endorsed. I'm not so critical of 'growth hacking' or leveraging bandwagon effects... after all, it's an Open Source tool you can choose to use or not. Personally, if I were in the same position, I'd rather leverage my status and previous success to *growth hack* new projects into success, especially if the idea is the tool should be built by the community that uses it.
These are figlet fonts, right?
Rather than printing them all on separate lines, try using smth like this. myname = str(input("What is your name? ") print("Hello",myname,", nice to meet you!)
And, remove the indents from the lines, they are important for iterations and functions and the computer gets confused when there are indents where there shouldnt be
Remove the indent on line 4, 8, 10 and 11
This was actually the inspiration for this. I wanted to see if you could find patterns in other ways of displaying primes.

I dont know but I know which subreddit is ;) /r/learnpython 
I’d recommend Programming Python. Start at the beginning and go through the entire book. If you don’t understand something, keep at it until you do.
\&gt; **Trying to learn python, what did I do wrong** &amp;#x200B; You posted in /r/Python instead of /r/learnpython :D &amp;#x200B; (indentation is important in python, you can't just go adding spaces and tabs wherever you want)
But then when I press run all I get is “Hello World! what is your name?” Nothing else shows up 
I tried to copy what I saw in automate the boring stuff 
Because you still have the lines indented. Make sure the text all starts at the very start of the line or use the method said above
He didn't. His original point was over people having constructive criticism. The fact that some idiot decided to make a pipenv\_sucks account and posted this link to his subreddit is * not indicative of *this* community * not indicative of the situation.
Don't you mean dynamic languages? Or are you saying that C# and Java are in the same category as Python?
If you like challenges and bleeding edge libraries, I would recommend reading and learning about [trio](https://trio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Community is great there, and there is a number of fun and advanced stuff to do there. As impostor syndrome goes, [we're all there](https://xkcd.com/1053/). Find something _you enjoy_, even better if it's to scratch your own itch. 
No one has really said this yet, so I guess I will. Programming as a profession is the creation of some value in the world. For the vast majority of people, this is a team sport, you will never have all the insights alone. If you’re not programming with someone, you’re not a professional programmer. 
Because the program is waiting for you to type your name from the input. Need to type something and press enter

You spell with "me" so I guess British? FYI the computer one is just "program". There's a campaign right now in UK that says teaching programming in schools isn't necessary, as the UK has started teaching it and some ppl are angry. Now it's true that you probably won't all graduate to be programmers, but why they are teaching it is that they need enough people with tech skills that computers are no longer seen as magic, and teaching that in school is the way to do this. For example, carpenters or cooks or car mechanics aren't seen as magic but as "normal skills". However programming is still "magic". The teach programming campaign should fix this, and soon you'll get "master coder" on tv just like "master chef".

Rather than doing myname = input() Do myname = str(input("What is your name? ") print(myname)
Maybe the uppercase at the beginning? I'm not sure about that
Couldn't agree more. There's just no way to be able to build technology effectively or at all for that matter, without a team. You need the collaboration and synergistic effect. We're all wired differently and cause others around us to think differently. When it comes to programming, that's how great things are created.
Still doesn’t work when I change it to myName
Your last point is partially correct. If you knew the label, you would just do 2 queries without a join. The first would be a query on EmployeeType to get the employee type ID and the second would be on Employee without a join using the employee type ID. That would probably be faster than one joined query. You'd have to test it for sure. I'd guess that most of the time, you'd already know the ID so only one query without a join would be necessary. 
It says invalid syntax

You could try hosting your own repo, pypi-server is a lightweight option with a docker build. Jfrog has a artifactory that runs something similar that you might want to look into. It’s good it your code base isn’t just python.
Wow yes thank you!!!! You got it! Any idea why the automate the boring stuff chapter was able to use the non raw input? If not that’s fine but just wondering

I had to use raw input 
PLS can't find any definition outside of the current file for me for some reason and seems to have issues with our Django app. I don't really have any issues with using Jedi though.
Jesus, no. Yes, that stuff is true. But you need someone reviewing code, you need to be writing documentation with someone, and quite frankly, most systems of value are simply to big to program alone. You also need feedback, to make sure you’re not getting tunnel vision and making what you want to make versus what the customer wants to make. A good tech lead will make sure you stay on the right path. Good engineering management will figure out the kinds of projects you need to work on to grow as a programmer, as well as adding value to the company and to you in equal share. They will help you deliver value you can feel, and keep you motivated on the projects that you get. I’m not uttering a platitude when I say you should program with others, this is a pragmatism that leads to quality product. 
Sorry? I don't understand what are you saying :-(
To top it off, most python hacking books are outdated and Python 2 specific.

IEX doesn’t have everything I want.. I’m looking for mutual funds and option chains
Cool library, I actually saw it a couple days ago while looking at your \`shutdown\` library.
It's not about one user, I just point that as an example of how reddit in general can be. If the toxic hating/constructive criticism ratio is high enough, it's not worth it to rummage through a ton of shit to find a couple of interesting comments. And I think it's pretty human (ha) and understandable to get focused in the negative comments. It's not healthy, nor recommendable, and it's something I actively avoid. But damn if it ain't understandable. Bottom line, I don't agree with how he react to the whole situation, but it's not like it was completely unwarranted.
&gt; His original point was over people having constructive criticism. He specifically mentions a thread with criticism as a positive thing, so, I don't know what mean. "Pipenv is garbage" is not very constructive. &gt; The fact that some idiot decided to make a pipenv_sucks account and posted this link to his subreddit is not indicative of this community This is reddit, and aggressive idiots are pretty much a defining trait of this site. r/python is better than a lot of other subs, but the ratio of assholes to nice people is not zero, and is not even **that** low. As I said in the other comment: I think that he handled this thing pretty poorly, sure. But a) he didn't exactly started the conflict and b) I can empathize with how he might have felt about the whole situation. 
Check out https://adventofcode.com/ https://projecteuler.net/ And it's also good to get in the habit of browsing github to find interesting projects to use and eventually contribute, especially in your field of expertise.
It’s called programming python by Mark Lutz. And Metasploit the penetration testers guide. It’s a decent intro.
Btw what aspects of hacking are you interested in? Usually it’s spread between web and network. Web is easier to get into in my opinion due to the bugbounties available at sites like bugcrowd.com. This makes it assessable for you to make money from it much easier than network as well without having a full time pen testing job.
Very well put. Everything you said is simply true
You should completely understand every line as you write it. If you don't, work it out in the interpreter or a jupyter notebook until you know what it is doing, and how it can fail. Build up your program from these individually understood lines. &amp;#x200B;
&gt; He specifically mentions a thread with criticism as a positive thing, so, I don't know what you mean. "Pipenv is garbage" is not very constructive. If you decided to read the thread I linked, you would see people giving tons of instances where Kenneth ignored criticism or decided to say he doesn't care and won't even bother discussing it. "Pipenv is garbage" isn't constructive, correct. But the majority of comments were not this. They were "I like X, but Y is flawed". And those are the comments Kenneth shat on and decided directly translated into "Pipenv is the worst". The "pipenv is garbage" commentary didn't come through *until* he started to shit on actual constructive criticism. &gt; This is reddit, and aggressive idiots are pretty much a defining trait of this site. r/python is better than a lot of other subs, but the ratio of assholes to nice people is not zero, and is not even **that** low. "Hello Mr Agressive idiot. Everything you have ever said is mean and not constructive simply because you are on reddit." That's the strawman you're pulling, batman. &gt; As I said in the other comment: I think that he handled this thing pretty poorly, sure. But a) he didn't exactly started the conflict and b) I can empathize with how he might have felt about the whole situation. He started the conflict the moment he decided to make constructive criticism non-constructive and personal in his head. I can't empathize with a human being so disgusting that he decides to set back ideas about mental health ages by scapegoating his systematic, long term, assholitude, on BPD, and so egotistical at that that he can't admit he was wrong in how he took *constructive* criticism as a declaration of war.
This isn't what you're likely to hear from this subreddit, but I think you should consider seeing a therapist.
As a matter of fact, I do see several. And it's extremely emotionally and physically tolling. So, thanks for your suggestion. Is your life so black and white that even an anecdotal post about my trials in programming is considered entirely inappropriate for a sub typically for discussing the technology itself? Either your an asshole, have autism, or Else I would suggest you to get some therapy. Or don't, it likely wouldn't help. Likely you're just like the many: a prick. I just don't get people like you. You literally could've said anything in the world, and you decide to go out with a condescending put down. Just because. There are many like you and they all have one thing in common: Issues. Which is why I think the therapist is the best option for you as well.
The simplist would be a web ui using something like bottle or flask. Do you want the script to run on the RPi? Python has Tk as a standard ui library but you can also use wxwidgets also if you want a desktop app experience. I don't have much history with Python UI's and I'm sure others may have better ideas depending on the situation 
IndentationError: **unexpected indent**
Pandas ftw...
Pycom.io i think
Poetry. It does everything you need without being complicated or getting in your way. And I really like its build features.
Yep, therapy. Try to have a nice night...
It's okay to not understand everything as u code it, as long as u experiment with it and read different sources at the same time to make sure you grasp the concept.
Learn Python the Hard Way by Zed Shaw 
Get in the habit of writing it yourself as a beginner. And also to read the error. It says line 4, so you know that's the issue. Figure it out from there.
I am using \`virtualenv\` and \`pipenv\` on non django Python project.
Hello! I'm a bot! I see someone has already suggested going to r/learnpython, a sub geared towards questions and learning more about python. I highly recommend posting your question there. Please follow the subs rules and guidelines when you do post there, it'll help you get better answers faster. Show /r/learnpython the code you have tried and describe where you are stuck. **[Be sure to format your code for reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/faq#wiki_how_do_i_format_code.3F)** and include which version of python and what OS you are using. *** ^(this bot is written and managed by /u/IAmKindOfCreative) ^(This bot is currently under development and experiencing changes to improve its usefulness)
OP, i'm just here to tell you that you *don't* need raw_input to do what you wanted to do. Instead of having line 2 and 3 seperate, what you do is you write it like this, as other commenters have suggested: MyName = input("What is your name? ") This way you don't have to use raw_input when not needed, and you save a line and make things cleaner. I did the first *ask for name* then *print name* here, so you can see what it can look like in this picture. https://i.imgur.com/a3oCT5M.png
I simply have a short fuse for people who are indecent online for no reason but to indulge a whim and, the kicker: doing so whilst under an alias. It's a perfect place for people to be as damaging and indecent as desired - indulging their enjoyment of condescending, and simply tearing down others for fun. It allows you to be vindictive, the true person you are. And no one will ever know. 
i want them both however im first starting to get into programming now i do plan to learn 4 languages before actually getting into some hcking. i did some research and found out that for Cyber Security i need to learn C, C++, JavaScript and Python
You need to get more specific. Generally it doesn't work so that you watch tutorials until something clicks and you understand all the code. Python is just a language you can use to solve a large variety of problems, pick something specific enough you want to understand and go from there. If you want to understand "python" in general, you're going to have a bad time, because there is an impossible amount to learn in that case, endless libraries etc. Figure out what you'd like to do and why you want to learn python in the first place. That will help you break things down and learn things in more easily digestible chunks and in an order that makes sense.
Are you sure you didn't miss "" inside the ()
The script would run on our desktop, the Raspberry Pi acts as a middle man through which we can do all of our DAQ and control our test stand. Thanks for mentioning wxwidgets though I will definitely check it out.
Pretty sure there was some winner who did this. Also they analyzed the frequency of certain topics so they would know what might be on the episode they were to be on.
&gt; I've been using pip + virtualenv &gt; Recently my website build process broke because a sub-dependency of a top-level dependency got updated You could stick with pip + virtualenv and just add [pip-tools](https://github.com/jazzband/pip-tools) to that workflow to pin your dependencies.
I have found tkinter to be fairly simple. That being said the documentation is kindof all over the place. It works well on different systems too in case you need to switch. 
How do you plan on communicating with the Pi from the desktop? 
Contribute to some open source projects - you can do something small and well-defined, but still be part of something significant! Find issues to work on at, in rough order: - https://yourfirstpr.github.io/ or https://www.firsttimersonly.com/ - https://github.com/MunGell/awesome-for-beginners or similar - https://up-for-grabs.net/ - Anything in your dependencies! Here's the warning: working on things with a group means there will be a lot of stuff you need to do that isn't writing the main code - formatting, CI, tests, review, *just finding the code you need to change* - and all of this can seem dispiriting. **Ask the maintainers for help.** Every project on these lists is there because they *want* to help new contributors, so for their sake don't get stuck and give up too soon. Start very, very, very small. I suggest fixing a single typo, just to get some experience in the process of contributing. And over time, you'll find it gets easier and easier as you learn about specific projects and get a sense for what they all have in common.
As long as you're doing something, it's better than nothing. But taking on all of that will be exhausting and you might quit as your progress may not show itself across all those topics. Frankly, you should get into Python and Metasploit at the same time as studying materials for the CEH certification. That will be well rounded to start off and get you involved in some of the main concentrations.
Well i am currently studying Computer Information System at college (Bachelors) but they dont give much about Cyber Security but just one class or two. Im currently looking for a book to get started on python and you are the second one to mention Metasploit? I have no idea of what that is. Also note im a begginer at this like start from 0 
Wired connection, probably via USB. &amp;#x200B;
Thanks but I meant just a server where I can keep all my dependencies. I don't want to keep the entire PyPI server's contents which is what this looks like.
Might be simpler to use a web interface running on the Pi. You can make very modern interfaces for the web but you'll have direct access to the Pi's hardware. 
I kinda feel bad for the guy. I mean `requests` is just a masterpiece and an example of great python code. I get it, some people are dissatisfied with `pipenv`, I don’t use it myself. The article brings some good points criticizing it but I don’t really understand some personal attacks here. Should we at least admire him for `requests`? It’s kinda not fair for this person to be hated so much, and I’m sure a lot of us use `requests` on a daily basis. Lastly, can we just fork `pipenv` and fix it if we don’t agree with some decisions he makes?

Made a simple library for uploading a file to [pomf.se](https://pomf.se) remnants. Uploaded to pypi so I can just pip install lol. I want to start contributing to open source projects, if you have one, hit me up! the library repo : [https://github.com/yukinotenshi/pyupload](https://github.com/yukinotenshi/pyupload)
Precisely. Most big companies will have you do interviews in a language of your choice. They can teach you syntax, no problem. 
I’m only remarking on the potential for undiscovered broken code in interpreted languages. This can be considered a risk when used for important tasks. 
Additionally, raw_input() does not exist in Python 3. I'm guessing the book may be teaching Python 3, and if OP is using Python 2 there may be some issues. 
I don't understand why Java should have more undiscovered broken code than C++ at runtime. 
I'll certainly look into it but due to the nature of our testing we often need to go into the middle of nowhere where there is no web connection. Additionally, data acquisition needs to be as reliable as possible and I can't risk getting locked out of the hardware because of a shaky connection during testing.
Of course it is, but my question is still valid. Why use monolithic anything?
I sympathize too and I kinda feel bad for being a bit hard about it. But man that was a really hard lesson for me to learn. I still have issues asking for help from others. That unwillingness to participate in the give and take of the human experience of learning tremendously slowed me down. 
r/learnpython would probably the place to go
So many questions
I don't quite understand what this tool is. Could someone explain it to me? Can't you just start a \`venv\` and run pip commands from within it? Or am I missing the point?
Because interpreted code gets parsed when execution reaches a particular line of code. Compiled code gets parsed at compile time. Of course python does get bye compiled at load, so it's not quite true, but there are certain classes of bugs (e.g. misspelt identifiers) that compilers pick up, but python only catches at run-time. 
You could set up the Pi in AP mode and connect directly to the Pi and cut out any internet or LAN. I'm assuming you're using a new model Pi with WiFi. I'm thinking and adding the USB connection just adds to the complexity. 
I think some level of programming is going to be a basic skill for a huge number of jobs. Even if it's just macros in office tools so you're not doing stuff by hand. 
Because not being monolithic is not a requirement for good software. Monoliths are not inherently bad (as the people micro-servicing the shit out of everything would advertise), so disqualifying anything that’s a monolith is pretty extreme, I would say. Would you say Linux/macOS/k8s/emacs/... are all bad pieces of software (or would you stop using them) because they’re monoliths?
The only thing i don't like about python are classes
Conda is used more oftenly by data scientists and mathematicians who don't python well but have to use it. And it's not the majority of python community, thus conda doesn't mentioned often
As a data scientist is healthcare, I've never had to write my own classes. The closest I've come is by making a list of a few objects with named entries in R in order to pass a few things together in and out of custom functions in a predictive model pipeline.
&gt; Just being honest. No reason for what you just posted. None. You're in a serious need of a reality check. This entire thread is like watching a toddler have a temper tantrum. Here's some honesty for you: &gt;I'm the hardest worker I know. You haven't finished a project in two years. What you've been doing is messing around, not working. &gt;I just can't finish a damn project. So, I get hours and hours deep into a project and just end up spinning my wheels for dozens of hours until something else catches my interest. And repeat. Things get difficult and you start chasing the next shiny things. Sorry, not a hard worker. &gt;I've been learning entirely on my own. I can honestly say I've received zero assistance apart from help on minor bugs. Too proud to ask for help but not too proud to make a big thread just cry and whine. &gt;I've never spoken a word in person to anyone on the subject of programming. With so many beggars, I just refuse to be that guy milking it and pissing people off looking for handouts. A: There's nothing wrong with asking for help. B: Even if there was, please read your own thread and ask yourself what is more pathetic. Having a tantrum like this or asking for help every now and then. &gt;I've tried. But I'm still to green and need assistance. Too proud to ask for help but you still need assistance? If you can't figure things out on your own then ASK FOR HELP FOR FUCK'S SAKE. Seriously, just the act of asking for help will help you solve your own problems more often than not. I can't tell you how many times just taking a step back and writing out and explaining a problem from scratch to someone who's not involved at all makes me find a solution on my own before ever clicking "submit". &gt;So, if anyone is looking for someone to collaborate with on something real, feel free to send me a message. I'd love to be a part. If you collaborate with someone in the future, please send them a link to this thread so they know what they're getting into. I hope you take a step back and reevaluate your entire approach and most importantly drop your ego until you've got something to justify it. Go out for a walk, meditate for a bit, come back and read your own thread and ask yourself if this is the kind of person you want to be. Good luck.
You might want to use pillow, which lets you build a png from integers representing color values.
After a little reading, if you're using a Pi Zero you can make it a USB gadget and also have access to the GPIO. It's a bit more involved but then writing a GUI python application would work pretty well. IIRC they're is a way to package a python script to a single executable that also contains the interpreter. Might be handy to do that as well
Classes you don't like, or the way python does classes in particular?
Most would agree you are quite detached from The social dynamics in the development community. What you're reading is a very common sentiment. Why the hell do you think you got the responses that it did? Why didn't I go out and ask for help? Exactly because of people like you. I'm one of the most caring, empathetic person I know. I'm a son of a pastor. I couldn't be more different than you which is why I absolutely detest people like you who think what you're doing here is OK. And that's the end of it. You will always be you, the world and society be scorned.
I don't like the way python does classes, or maybe I just didn't like the way I was taught python classes
I think python classes are pretty amazing because of how straightforward and flexible they are. Might be worth giving it another go.
Did you look into fish or zsh?
&gt; Why didn't I go out and ask for help? Exactly because of people like you. People who would be more than willing to help you if you came to them with a well defined problem they have experience with? Yeah, wouldn't want to ask people like that for help. Rather just cry and threaten to quit. &gt;I'm one of the most caring, empathetic person I know. I'm a son of a pastor. I'm starting to think you're either mentally challenged or a troll. You are "one of the most EVERYTHING you know". You have a giant ego and nothing to back it up. I'm going to block you know so I don't have to come across more of your whining. Get some therapy for your narcissism.
Mentally challenged, got me. Can't believe it took you this long. Must be getting better at hiding it I guess
See also r/algotrading. IMHO, look into Tiingo API on github. Tiingo has rock solid data and a really simple python API.
If your straw men was all compiled into a single executable, I would say they was bad. Bad they aren't,m so your point is void. The point that having a strong coupling between three un-related parts is an accident waiting to happen, have been proven time and time again. 
For general data analytics work, I have rarely used classes. I do use classes for other data-related tasks like building &amp; merging certain datasets early in the process. Things like making building API wrappers and such. I've also used them in situations where graphs were required (the edges &amp; vertices kind of graph). 
I use classes to organize the flow of information across departments. For example, tell someone what data structure you want and it’s attributes. Otherwise, for large projects, you get people who make structures that are unpythonic - lists of dictionaries of tuples of DataFrames that repeat information. In nice IDE’s like PyCharm (given good documentation) developers can query the attributes and better understand data that you send back within your class too. I’m admittedly more of a quant than a data scientist now, but my rule of thumb is now - “if you’re getting complex information (particularly if you have to iterate), it’s probably best as a class.”
That’s not the same as saying “why use monolithic anything”. I agree with you that strong coupling between unrelated parts is a bad idea. But you can also have a monolith being built using fairly decoupled components internally. The point is “why use monolithic anything” is a **very** broad generalisation that’s highly dependant on context and is not always true or false.
You forget one reason to implement the completions as bash: Startup time. Starting a whole python process can hardly compete with an already warmed up bash process executing a script. Have you measured the response time of your python implementation against a similar implementation in a bash script?
I assume you are a normally functioning adult that have the capability to reason about things. That's why I don't put in a lot of exceptions, that are totally meaningless in this context. But if you insist, I'll remember to patronize you the next time.
In my opinion, classes and pandas-style tables serve a similar role to structure data. If I'm working with structures that are pretty well defined and have particular relationships, then I'll invest the time to create classes to explicitly define those relationships. Tables are useful to quickly analyze the data without explicitly defining the relationships.
why
Have You? Python starts really fast. It's been one of the things they really optimize. I haven't tried OPs code but `python -c whatever` always returns really fast for me
How about [pywebview ](https://github.com/r0x0r/pywebview)? You can build your UI using web technologies. 
For that you might want to use [devpi](https://devpi.net/docs/devpi/devpi/stable/%2Bd/index.html)... it can mirror PyPi as well, but it's more useful in allowing you to push your own packages to a locally hosted index that you can `pip install` from, while also caching dependencies from PyPi that you install through it (if it's able to connect to PyPi).
Yep, Thanks
I'm still impressed how this is such a burden. How come we can't get anything as close as maven for java? Dependencies shouldn't never make block the installation of an another dependency, yet that's how pip was designed. I guess this issue could be subject to future development of we attempt to create python 4, since it's such a fundamental issue. 
why not? Could be cool.

Classes are just templates for objects. If you have all the objects you need then there's no need to create the overhead of more of them.
