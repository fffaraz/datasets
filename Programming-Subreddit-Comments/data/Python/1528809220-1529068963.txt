Thanks. I'll definitely look into this. It's been on my mind to try some home automation with python (something I have never tried) and Porcupine looks great.
Hahaha thanks it also be used to tell the toppings on the pizza
Thanks I don’t know how to do that
I love the idea! I'm a total noob, so I can't give you feedback, but I'll read through your code and learn from it and steal... and be inspired by it for other projects.
Actually that’s a better name for this lol
What you mean by that 
I think so it’s AI lol
Jin Yiang!!!
Am I right in thinking this kind of funky behaviour underpinned the pre `async` keyword asynchronous libraries?
Can you post this to github ?
You mean the link or the video
Lol
Here’s the link https://github.com/mraza007/Pizza-or-Not-a-Pizza
Reminds me of that cheese or petrol robot
Thanks. Yes for sure i will get to it.
Coroutines; so yeah 
`print()` is consistent with every other method. I definitely agree with the change. Consistency is good.
Pizza is American not italian bum. Now gtfo
Another pattern would be to use a decorator, such as `@register`, so you can choose which functions to include. menu_functions = [] def register(fn): menu_functions.append(fn) return fn @register def hello(): print('hi!') 
Oh I agree you are right, but it's like an old car..it may not be the best car, but doesn't mean you don't miss driving it.

U sound like a British Lord. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pizza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pizza) 
You can solve it pretty well in even &lt;200 lines of code. The edge cases aren't an issue when you can easily adapt it to your environment to account for those.
Many thanks
They may also want to use a dict from name to callable, like `menu_functions[fn.__name__] = fn`. 
Because `threading.Thread` apparently expects its `args` argument to be a tuple.
Have you checked the sidebar/sub info.

My toy language, written in Python and using LLVM: [https://github.com/syegulalp/Akilang/](https://github.com/syegulalp/Akilang/) Most recent additions: a decorator system. Right now there's only a couple of decorators (and the most recent public build doesn't have them implemented yet), but it allows inlining of functions or suppression of same. We also now have the ability to create function pointers, again specified by way of a decorator. The project has some included demos, like Conway's Game Of Life. I'd like to have as many of those kinds of things available right out of the box.
The last thing the tech community needs is more people making trivial things in to an over blown social issue

Love the idea! Suggestion: change `rating &gt;= 7` to a call to a `check_if_good(rating)` function. Makes it easier to configure to my specific rating scale.
Las thing I heard is that for regular users they basically have no api access at all From what I've read this restricting the API happened after Facebook bought them

Hey that's it! How did you know to find that, googling didn't get me there. I don't feel like I am remotely close enough to knowing enough to read the source to figure that stuff out :E
Thanks for that link, but I am really at the stage of trying to get engineers interested . More of a &gt; 1/3'd page graphic and a simple message to pique interest and get them googling or a simple URL. Many of our engineers can program, but in our company Perl/C/Verilog/VHDL/Tcl are the norm, and I think we should plug into the rich Python/Jupyter ecosystem. 
Honest answer is that I don't know. I consider it an example of [tribal knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribal_knowledge).
If all you're doing is automating some bash commands why don't you just write a bash script?
Because there will be a bigger Python program that activates this smaller python script. I have very little experience with Bash, so I'm not very aware of what is all possible. Maybe my bigger python program (that would now call on the smaller python program) can also call that same bash script as you suggest?

Good bot
Since you are using `pytest`, any reason to not just use what is built-in already? https://docs.pytest.org/en/3.6.1/capture.html#capturing-of-the-stdout-stderr-output 
Fair enough. You could probably have your little script call a bash script but I'm sure there's a reason you're doing it the way you're doing it already. I had a look at the source issue: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7040592/calling-the-source-command-from-subprocess-popen Looks like that's what you're running into. I'm just heading home now so haven't properly looked at 2nd issue, but you could try using python to write to the file as you're already collecting the output into your output/error variables

https://learnpythonthehardway.org/python3/ I recommend this to anyone seeking how to brush up on his/her python skills. While there's a lot of difference between python3 and python2, you'll find that the syntax is a lot the same. Probably the most notable difference is `print()` in python3 versus `print` in python2. One of my favorites - upgraded string formatting: # python2.7 name = 'Jake' print 'Hello, %s' % name # python3 name = 'Jake' print(f'Hello, {name}') # output Hello, Jake 
In should_update_ratings(), consider changing the "if answer == 'N'" to an elif. The 'Y' and 'N' conditions are mutually exclusive. I admit it's pointless in this case since both conditions use the 'return' statement. Also, why are you calling should_update_ratings() recursively instead of looping?

You don't need to activate a virtual environment to use the virtualenv. Instead, you can include a shebang in your script that points to the full path of the python binary in the virtual environment. So if your python virtual environment is located at `/Users/example/dev/python/myProject/venv` (`venv` being the named virtual environment), then in your python script, add to the very top of the script (line #1): `#!/Users/example/dev/python/myProject/venv/bin/python` With the shebang at the top of the script, when the script is ran, or executed, it will do so using the virtual environment's python binary &amp; site packages. However, if you do simply want to activate the virtual environment and not use a shebang, you can do: `. /Users/example/dev/python/myProject/venv/bin/activate`, then simply `python myPyScript.py` to use the virtualenv's Python binary. All that being said, as randoname123545 pointed out, you're better off keeping your bash commands in a bash script which you execute from within the python script. While the `subprocess` module facilitates executing bash commands, there are limitations to it (such as grep'ing, and pipes `|` - as you've found, it seems) and honestly, it's more clean &amp; modular to have the python code execute a bash script rather than clutter up your codebase with all these subprocess commands. Lastly, if you'd like to use Python instead, there is a strong chance that you could achieve what you're trying to do using the actual Python framework &amp; modules. Given the issues you've run into using the subprocess module, you should keep python code separate from bash scripting &amp; you can use the `subprocess` module to simply execute a bash script, rather than try and execute the actual bash commands from within Python. Python and bash are very different things, don't try to force them to coexist in such a manner that they were not meant to.
This is a more accurate explanation than what I wrote.
There are plenty of places where you might do it and it wouldn't be confusing. For example, when doing unpacking: {k:v for k,v in mydict.items()}
Yeah, the elif is slightly extra visual clutter. About the recursion, I mostly do functional programming so it's muscle memory and this way you don't have to list the right conditions twice. (or use while True but that's also less beautiful)
I primarily deal with code on microcontrollers when not using Python. Every time I see a recursive call, I see a chance at a stack overflow. Another Pythonic method would be using a for else block. Give the user a chance at entering it N number of times and then bail out if they don't give a valid response.
Have you tried installing it using conda? There is an install link on anaconda's website for pandas_datareader. You should try that out. Also, you're probably installing different version of pandas so it's always better to do a conda installation of something if you're running Anaconda instead of the usual pip. 
Hey guys, Just made an account at work. I work at a large corporation, ~10B in annual revenue. I am tasking myself to enhance the customer analytics side of the analytics department. My idea (and what management wants) is to provide infographics built per customer. I am currently focused on customers in a certain range of annual revenue (500k-1.5M). I use Microstrategy (which creates SQL code) and typically generate/pull my data from that source and export to Excel. Though, my python exposure is limited - I'm currently enrolled in a Udemy course to learn more and try and implement it with my work/make things easier/faster/automate simpleish tasks. So I guess my overall question pertains to - After I start pulling my data and building some infographics on certain templates - I want to see if it were at all possible to automate/refresh the SQL data source and have it automatically update on the infographic template. I am not sure if this is possible across several programs, I'm at the "thinking about solutions" part of my project. In the meantime, I'll be doing simple SQL pulls, exporting to Excel, formatting my data, a few calculations --- once my data is all nice, I'll be putting on infographics for management. That process might take just a little time per customer, and I imagine I'd have to run it by customer at least once for the initial data pull. But once I know what I need, I could see myself programming a task in SQL to change dates automatically, refresh that data, get that data back, automate calculations in Excel to autopopulate after the refresh, etc. But the idea of automatically changing the infographic is what i'm exploring 
- Spark is general purpose data processing framework where you can do build batch or real time streaming pipelines and it comes lot of 'nice to have' apis. - Kafka is pub-sub system aka message broker. It does provide very basic real time processing framework (via kafka streams). - Usually Kafka is used as pub/sub system and Spark/Flink/etc are using to consumer data from Kafka and process it.
how do i do that?
I just tried installing from the anaconda website and just reran the same line of code after restarting the kernal and I'm still getting the same error

I'm the bot author, and I just added a comment on your /r/learnpython post, but I'll say this here: it's less about bots and more about implementing basic algorithms, stringing them together, and putting them on into action. It could be a data processing pipeline, or some system that changes constantly, like weather, reddit, stocks, or twitter. The complex stuff, isn't making it a bot and putting it on those systems, it's the algorithms that make the decisions. A bot just takes the code you wrote and makes it interact with the world. The rest is the work--science, engineering, and programming--you put into it. And the work of amazing programmers before you. Those parts can be put inside a bot, data processing pipeline, or anywhere else.

Awesome description, thank you for your effort! Will try to write a bash\-script which I call with python then
Just a little suggestion, it's a bad idea to include virtualenv and \_\_pycache__ in the repository. It is customary that repositories either include a requirements.txt, a Pipfile or setup.py file, which say what kind of dependencies are required to run the program. The virtualenv is specific to platform and to Python version. Additionaly it includes all the packages installed from PyPI, which can be reinstalled very easily from the files mentioned above. See https://pip.readthedocs.io/en/1.1/requirements.html for info about requirements.txt and something bit longer about Pipenv/Pipfile: https://realpython.com/pipenv-guide/#pipenv-introduction In \_\_pycache__ there are python bytecodes precompiled by your interpreter, however if people were to clone this and run this, their interpreter would most likely disregard the cache and compile into bytecode again. The precompiled codes do not add any relevent information, so they can be excluded. See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3719243/recommended-gitignore-file-for-python-projects for other stuff that are also regularly exluded from git. 
Nvm, I already managed to do it.
Thanks, that actually helped a lot I did spend a few hours on research but regex is very confusing for me. I know how to do the rest but it was the regex that was blocking me here. Thanks!
Have a look at accessing Google Sheets from Python.
Not all services are intended to run at boot. If you do need that, then systemd is a good alternative, just as /u/acecile said.
Probably got though proof reading because it's a small error . it uses python 2.x I think it's a old book which has now probably been replaced with a corrected version.
I didn't say that it's complicated. I said that you need to provide and install that configuration file -- especially the latter is not necessarily trivial if you want to support multiple Linux distributions. And, as I said, this rules out using `pip` as a distribution mechanism, so you need to provide packages for the various distributions' package managers instead (apt, etc.). Since it's not easy to get into their official repositories you may need to host those packages on your own, which further complicates the installation for your users. All of that is perfectly doable and for many applications this is indeed the best way. These don't need the `service` module, and that's fine!
The one you'll find in /r/learnpython 
Check this, not sure if it is the best but it is good: http://www.scipy-lectures.org/intro/
What specifically are you referring to?
Yep, right on Python’s official site (http://python.org) there’s a great and absolutely free tutorial.

A positive result would oppose the claim that adding pineapple makes it *not pizza.* But it would't oppose the claim that adding pineapple makes it *bad pizza.*
The problem of the engineers is not the ressources or the langage by itself, it's the inertia. You will not change that with a poster, but by slowly increasing the number of "python people" in the area...
People already made that I guess
Thanks for the tip I would definitely look into that. I have been programming in python for about 2 months now But thanks for this tip
Yup it will
Hahahaha
I love Jin Yiang
Thanks 
Yup you are right 
Hahahah pineapple or not 
Lol 
You are welcome 
I wish 
I'll be more specific. for tuple with single item, don't omit the parenthesis . Other unpacking syntax is great
Last I looked yes, but they also offer "pro" courses for a price. 
https://stackoverflow.com/a/4915408/84349 It appears that here it has this effect. I believe this is neither good style nor should something like this be either part of a CS corriculum or be asked in a exam. However, I also guess that good and bad courses are taught both inside and outside of India.
ok thank u so much
The program is really good and neatly written but i would suggest you start adding comments and docstrings in your program especially if you are going to make the code open\-source.
Will do
I'm not too familiar with Click usage and didn't know about locale annoyances. Do you know if you'd have the same problem using Plumbum (which is awesome)? I haven't run into anything like this yet.
Then it's a scam!!!!
not bad. did only some php stuff when i went to school. wasnt so structured and clean code :D
That's been happening too. There are new hires who know/use Python, new projects on other sites that they are becoming aware of, my little chats and the odd email - the last email was mentining the award Jupyter got from the ACM but I keep the frequency of emails low.
We've built systems like this at my organization. Whatever your workflow Python can help. Where I am, we use Plotly.js and Chart.js to make our own dashboards that pull from a local SQL database. We use Flask for the front\-end with Redis for caching. If we used a BI tool we could alternatively use Python to refresh a data source periodically and allow the BI software to pull from that data source. It's hard to add more without specific questions from your use case. But keep going with Python and you won't be disappointed.
Mine or yours? I look back and cringe at the code which I did a few years ago when I had just started coding, it was messy.
The whole process is actually pretty simple: * Create a fork of the code you want to modify * Modify the code in your fork * Create a pull request (PR) - Comment your PR, explaining what are the changes you introduced and why they are beneficial to the original repository. * Wait for someone to review your PR (be wary that it can take some time) - Sometime PRs just rot into oblivion... See: - [creating a pull request from a fork](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/) - [creating a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) - [About pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/)
If you are sure about running a 32 bit OS, then you should be using the 32 bit installer. You can try the other, but the installation will fail.
Okay. Thanks!
So I should go with just X86 and *not* x86-64, right?
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA OMG you did? What else do you love? XD
This seemed an interesting question so I looked into it. The different treatment occurs very explicitly [here](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/blob/master/lib/matplotlib/cbook/__init__.py#L1470), and there's a comment saying `Iterate over columns for ndarrays, over rows otherwise.`, but it isn't clear why this particular behaviour has been chosen.
[It's a pizza](http://www.rebelcircus.news/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/4234234-103.jpg)
That is correct.
Currently working on two cool projects. Both based on Flask. ## MOSP [https://github.com/CASES\-LU/MOSP](https://github.com/CASES-LU/MOSP). A platform to create, edit and share JSON objects with schema based Web forms. It uses [json-editor](https://github.com/json-editor/json-editor), also an excellent project. Here is the official test instance, with some objects validated by a schema: https://mosp.herokuapp.com/schema/3 ## Freshermeat The new Freshmeat :-) [https://github.com/cedricbonhomme/Freshermeat](https://github.com/cedricbonhomme/Freshermeat) With an instance dedicated to security related projects: https://open-source-security-software.net It is possible to track releases and also CVE numbers. There is a GitLab/GitHub importer and a quite decent API.
Okay. Thank you. Also, one more thing, what *exactly* is the "Add Python 3.6 to PATH" checkbox asking?
If you add python to the path, you can just open a cmd and just type `python3.6.exe`(I think) or `python.exe` and start using it. The `PATH` is a list of directories where your system will search for executables. If the word you typed in is found there, it will run it. Without that, you will usually have to give the full path of the executable each time. For example, without that, you will have to type in `C:/Python3.6/bin/python3.6.exe` to run the python shell. I haven't used windows in a while, so the paths/commands I mentioned might be different. But everything else stands.
Interesting, thanks!
Learn to program on Coursera is a great way to start 
Thank you very much. One final thing- would it be a good idea to disable the path limit?
Evidence that a python 2 interpreter could not be written in python 3? 
What is "path limit"? I haven't heard of it before.
Path length limit. Right after the install the setup thing brought up the "Setup was successful" screen with a button on the bottom labeled "Disable Path Limit Length. Changes your machine's configuration to allow programs, including Python, to bypass the 260 character 'MAX_PATH' limitation."
This looks awesome! I geek out on testing and am always looking to make debugging easier. Can’t wait to give this tool a try 
Why is task management not a part of Django? Tbh Celery has had a history of being very unstable and buggy. We are using it in production and it’s source of so many problems. 
The only thing to note is Pykafka's API isn't setup like the native Confluent libraries in Java, so lining up what methods/funcs do what compared to the original library is a bit annoying sometimes. It also lacks SASL support (kafka-python supports it though). That being said, I like Pykafka more, it's more intuitive, but unfortunately kafka-python makes sense if you're looking heavily at the Confluent docs for Kafka and you don't want to match up what does what.
If you run the code in python shell, it should tell you the line the error ocurrs in. Most syntax errors are from parentheses or indentations errors. 
Fina-frickinly!
If you foresee yourself using deep paths, or long filenames, it is a good idea to disable the limit. However, I don't know what effects this has system wide. My recommendation is keep it, at the default value and you can address it if and when you need it.
Okay. Seriously, man, thanks for all the help. I appreciate it.
&gt; Want to run pipenv install foo inside a Docker container? Hope you've set the envvars you don't really care about Hmmm makes me wonder if there's capability in pip-land to enforce certain env vars when installing from pip, possibly by **--force-update-environment** or something flag

Anyone have any guesses as to how long this will take?
Oh but the tasty internet shit-flingibg
Main reason is that it's a bit out of scope for what Django wants to be.. You can add some with Channels, but we haven't updated to python3 yet so I don't know how powerful/reliable they are–I have very high hopes tho, should be the summer project!
I care about ease of use and how good it looks. With that, the hands down answer PyQt (or PySide, basically same difference other than licensing). Tkinter is somewhat unintuitive and ugly, but it's included with Python (you can build Python without Tk though) and using it vs. Qt will result in a smaller exe size. Also better than TkInter is WxPython. It uses native widgets (unlike Qt or Tk), but is less platform independent than Qt. It's also uglier than Qt, but prettier than Tk. It's also far more capable than Tk, but again, less so than Qt. The best tutorial I've see is here... http://zetcode.com/gui/pyqt5/
If the application doesn't have to be real time, I think your best bet in pose detection right now is deep learning (i.e: [https://github.com/ZheC/Realtime\_Multi\-Person\_Pose\_Estimation](https://github.com/ZheC/Realtime_Multi-Person_Pose_Estimation)). You can also use OpenCV but it would be more difficult to get something as accurate and robust . Now, if all the people using your application were wearing colored marks on each joint, it could be much more doable.

Would it be better if I would just track the boxing gloves? 
Celery supports Redis as broker long time ago not as result_backend. This is the place to store your result of your tasks. 
Also extra parens around tip1 in line above. 
Hi, I am using Celery as my main queue processing among others competitor. I found it quite stable and predicted, however, I found it hard to setup. I am curious which part is not stable and buggy?
Automating Excel copy-paste data lineage mapping by parsing SQL (yes, I am using sqlparse). It is currently a pita.
I love lots of things man! 
That's so great!

Again, different people have different needs. I see your main need is to be a close minded fanboy with a superiority complex. Like I said before, your small sample size of people who prefer Mac may be your experience but that is not the same for everyone. Maybe my experience is not the norm, but nonetheless it is still true the small number of people I know that have Mac do not like it. It really is okay if someone has a differing opinion/experience from your own,that's why I politely asked to hear someone's opinion/experience. 
I very much like click. Not keen on its "python 3 work arounds", which Armin is quite enamoured with. But to your question, yes I'd be interested. I hate the thought of going back to argparse, just to avoid these nuances.
I guess it could be somewhat simpler as you could start by using color selection to identify the gloves. Using images from at least two different angles you could then extract 3D data and use that to calculate speed and position of the gloves and identify different Hits by those.
Oof
Actually in pyrhon 2 raw_input takes in strings and input takes in integers and in python 3 input takes in strings 
You probably want to use Pandas. You can find a short introduction [here](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/10min.html)
Yeah I think that's my best bet. Now, how would I go about identifying the same punch at different angles? Like let's say from a front view and from a side view? Would I need two cameras? 
Doing the Lord's work right there! Nice job! 
Hahaha thanks 
You should consider using telegram bot too. Doesn't have the "sent from twilio free account" signature. And it's free and easy to use
I didn’t knew about telegram at the moment but now I can definitely use telegram Api too I am gonna make this project open source and ask for help with documentation 
Anyone who’s is interested in making this script better feel free to contribute to this project
Still messing around with my passion project in Flask this week. Last week I managed to get a rudimentary comment system working (no threaded comments or voting yet) and I'm probably only going to do a few minor qol changes to the commenting system this week. Planning to try to get threaded commenting working next week after my exams are done. It was quite fun working on comments because I ended up learning about fstrings, which are absolutely amazing to use. That and I actually was able to apply some level of OOP to make helper methods instead of having no OOP knowledge to show off (it isn't incredibly useful for such a small project honestly)
First I had to web scrape a database of product information from the woolworth's website (its a supermarket). Then I had to format it manually, which I am still in the process of doing. I plan on adding the following features: * Add up the total nutritional information at the end of work * Add up the total cost at the end of the week * Work with a set budget * Make it more stylish
What you want is a `.gitignore` file. The default Python one that Github provides is a good starting place.
input takes in strings as well. It just runs `eval()` on said string
Oh okay I’ll include that file
The code is in the following link: https://pastebin.com/qsijYt4z Thank you 
Can someone ELI5?
Take a look at [this library](https://pypi.org/project/python-chess/) to see what features should be supported. Recursion incurs overhead; a for loop would be more efficient.
Should be ready in time for Python 4 to come out 
The pathlib module is a pleasure to use. It handles lots of file tasks and finding the right method in the documentation can be a little tedious even (or maybe especially) if you're familiar with the legacy alternatives. So I wrote this summary of all the properties and methods grouped into to the type of tasks. I guess this guide sits part way between a narrative tutorial like this [RealPython](https://realpython.com/python-pathlib/) one and the alphabetical reference format of the [official documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html).
Seems to be "inspired" by Twilio's Not Hot Dog tutorial. https://youtu.be/MTVS2T8sjFA Might want to add something to your README.
Yup are you willing to add something to my READme
Please don't be *that* person who posts 1-3 words comments and expects everyone to understand.
One thing is that celery, at least until very recently, did not pin its requirements. Within this past months, one of its requirements updated, breaking celery. Within a day or so, celery pushed an update that fixed it, but this should not happen in a package so widely used as celery. 
Here's your problem: m_I = dis_Ta / 1,609.344 You would think that `m_I` now holds the result of dividing `dis_Ta` by the number `1609.344`, but it doesn't. Instead, it holds a **pair** of items, which were separated here by a comma. The first item of the pair is `dis_Ta/1` and the second item is `609.344`. Later, when the program got to `m_I / h_O` it tried to divide the **pair** (aka "tuple") of items by a single number and failed. Don't use commas in numbers. Commas mean something to Python and it isn't what it means to humans who write numbers by hand. 
I want a ‘create tests?’ button, then I can tweak/generate/run tests as needed. This is a solvable problem, and is begging for a solution. I’d pay $ for it.
Why did you add automated ordering?!!?! 
Agree with Mikeavelli, although [PETL](http://petl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/transform.html#petl.transform.basics.addfieldusingcontext) is another (much more lightweight) alternative.
TLDR: App Engine Standard is a helpful way to put your server on the cloud and used to only support Python 2, but will soon support the newer version: Python 3. Many modern software developers are happy because this will make their jobs easier. The App Engine Standard Environment is a product offered by Google where, instead of using your own hardware and physical computer to run your backend server, you can run your backend server on the cloud (a computer that Google rents out to you and is much cheaper since they rent out to millions of other people too). Google also takes care of many other tasks involved with running a backend server, which making your life easier. Python is a programming language that can be used to make backend servers (as well as many other things), but App Engine Standard Environment currently only supports version 2 of Python (you can use other programming languages as well). Version 3 of Python came out in 2008 and works somewhat differently than Python 2, so your code has to be either one or the other, but not both. Python 3 originally was buggy and unstable; however, Python 3 has improved a lot and is the future of Python software (Python 2 will no longer be maintained by the Python team after 2020). Many companies have stayed with Python 2 until today because it was very VERY stable and, more importantly, it worked (important for large\-scale business). Only in recent years have companies decided to start with Python 3 or to re\-write all their Python 2 code into Python 3 (Instagram had to do this not too long ago). For a while, if you wanted to run your Python 3 backend server on Google Cloud, you would have to do a lot of extra work (still less work than using your own physical servers). This update will benefit a lot of software developers, but is quite expected considering that Python 2 will soon be dropped by the Python Core Developers.
Oh jeepers, a matrix is not just a 2D array of data. People. I love python, but this nonsense bullshit **has to stop**. We can't just forward each hug emojis any time anyone says the word "python" in a basically content-free blog post. Have some dignity.
Ah yeah i do notice that also, Ithink it is good idea to make suggestion into the project to lock the deps.
Thanks @Mikeavelli, @timbledum. I have been using Pandas. This is my code: df\['Return'\] = ( df.Close.shift( 0 ) \- df.Close.shift( 2 ) ) / df.Close.shift( 0 ) df\['bullishSignal'\] = (df.Low \&lt; df.Low.shift(1).rolling(13).min()) &amp; (df.Close \&gt; ((df.High \- df.Low) / 2 \+ df.Low)) I do not know how to proceed and calculate the return from the date that the bullish signal is true.
Thanks for the advices!
I'm creating a script to do this at the moment. I'm going to use Gspread to access a Google sheet and then "do stuff". This [blog post](https://www.twilio.com/blog/2017/02/an-easy-way-to-read-and-write-to-a-google-spreadsheet-in-python.html) explains how to do it pretty well (the Google authentication section is a bit off but the rest is sound).
Looks very fishy to me. All of the "verified purchase" reviews are from the Kindle Edition, which is free. All of the reviews are super generic and either 4 or 5 stars, with a lone 2 star review.
Then don't get it. 
It's sort of amazing to me that there aren't more python game engines out there. `pygame` and `arcade` are basically it. This `libtcod` looked promising, but the graphics are definitely of a certain style. If you google "python game engine" you find things that are out-of-date, proprietary or not really game engines (`pyglet`, I'm looking at you).
Thanks for the link!!
Raw_input is for string and input is for everything else. You could get it to input list , integer , float , dictionary etc.. other than that error what problem is there ? Is it that the question is too basic ? 
I know they've been doing a lot of work to increase the cadence of version releases. I'd wager to say they'll have it in beta by the end of the year. 
This is great information thank you so much...do u recommend any books ? Or a form of practice?
To the people who downvoted this post, you are the scum of reddit. Why the fuck do you feel the need to downvote a post like this!
Yeah libtcod has been used for many hundreds of games (possibly over a 1,000 by now?), though traditionally very specific to that style. Technically it can be used for more complex tile-based styles, but many devs who want to go that route end up using other engines instead (or write their own). For example [this](http://i.imgur.com/E3THlaO.png) was done in libtcod, and there are some much more impressive examples out there that don't look like they were built in a terminal emulator, though I don't have links to them off hand.
Hasn't not supporting Python 3 already rendered it irrelevant?
Part of me wants to go through the tutorial using Arcade to see what libtcod has that Arcade needs. Just so many projects I want to do...
That's ridiculous. Python2 is EOL in less than 2 years. Red Hat is dropping support for it entirely, as of... like, *now*.
Seriously. I'm sitting thinking "OK, what all would a game engine need...."
No since a lot of people still use 2.7 and they also offer their flex environment where you can bring whatever container you want, including python 3. This is specifically for the standard environment.
Its hotdog, or its a not hotdog
Are you referring webscraping? There's a package called beautifulsoup, which parses webpages' HTML, and you can collect data from it, and store it in a text file or whatever. I'm pretty sure you can make it update constantly; just look at the documentation. Also, I'm pretty sure you can scrape multiple sites in one project. If not, you can just create multiple projects that write to the same text file.
I'm trying to add a dump function to [AREPL](https://github.com/almenon/arepl-vscode), so you can dump variables in the local scope. Once I finish that AREPL will almost be like a debugger! Ideally I would be using the actual python debugger library (bdb) but for now the hacky workarounds gets my app out the door much faster. Such is life :/
Your name could be placed on the page through an asynchronous request and what you normally see might be rendered after initial load. Alternatively, this seems like an especially likely website to try to catch and forbid scrapers. Either way, looking at the response data should make it fairly apparent which it is.
nope, that was already taken care of by wild pricing changes, an architecture and performance characteristics from hell, dumping partially written data into EVERYONEs datastore, unannounced software upgrades causing 500s randomly for the first few years of its life
But mine uses pizza only for pizza lovers
Excelent explanation, thanks!
Yeah, they're pretty powerful but personally I find reasoning about them to be pretty unintuitive. David Beazley has a good talk on them: [A Curious Course on Coroutines and Concurrency](http://www.dabeaz.com/coroutines/)
&gt; Alternatively, this seems like an especially likely website to try to catch and forbid scrapers. Either way, looking at the response data should make it fairly apparent which it is. Oh wow, I never thought about this. How do I know if this is the case, by looking at the response data? &gt; When you say you can find your name in the HTML when you login manually, do you mean when you right click and view Source or when you look at the developer console and look at the source tab? Right-click, inspect
i have seen that however do you know how to actually put it into one application like cus i want the images and stuff if that makes sense, if you could please help it would be very much appreciated 
Sure, [here's the script and symlink helper (and some methods of an all-purpose module I throw things into).](http://ianharmon.com/share/etc/randomwall.7z) /u/hkramran85 Regarding the way the symlink helper gets its permissions, it's based on some forum post and I haven't looked into whether there's a cleaner way that doesn't affect everything else in that folder (which appears to solely be lockscreens and their cached copies). So I don't know if it could ever cause issues, just make sure you check out what it does first. The wallpaper script should work after installing Pillow and changing the options below the changelog/imports, some of them use your computer's name to allow for different configs on different computers. You'll want to create the folder where the script stores a few files (default `C:\caches\lock-screen\`) There are some other things, like images with [!] in the file/folder name are ignored, [P] = pixel art and integer scaling is used, etc, but there's not a ton of code so the script behavior should be straightforward to change 
Flex environment FTW. 
There are some things you could improve: use an app factory instead of initializing the app in \_\_init\_\_.py. in views.py, don't do that inline dict thing. Write out the keys in an iterable (tuple or list, doesn't matter), then do `.append({k:v for k, v in zip(KEYS, p)})`. Less error prone and easier to maintain. Don't store the db in git. If you must, include something like a seed_db.py file to populate the database. Sticking the db on the `g` object is probably really bad for performance -- `g` is recycled with each request. Having just /api/get while also having a get folder seems like an anti-pattern. Likewise, having `module.get.get_xyz` is redundant, and you could just do `module.get.xyz` for naming and still convey the same thing. Or don't have a get folder at all and put those files elsewhere. Putting an empty table in your index.html seems wasteful, you should be able to make the contents of that table programmatically.
Yes! You can find some open source examples on github. Just look for “MUD” and python. If I was making one fresh, I’d use asyncio for it and wrap the the client connection in an ssh wrapper. For a more traditional approach, there is a somewhat dated book called “MUD game programming” that uses python and I think c++.
I didn’t know about this, thanks!

You want to check out r/learnpython as there's a little bit to learn and understand before consolidating your ideas into a well-enough-built program.
http://lmgtfy.com/?q=Best+python+ide
Pycharm is popular. You can also use sublime text with python related plugins. If you're a terminal guy, vim and neovim are good.
I understand already after studying CS how to program, just not sure for python entriely or how to consolidate the info into one page
I would definitely hate to use a community’s opinion, it’s not like they have an opinion 
I thought the post was interesting. I am only now really getting into python for data analysis. I found this short, simple post direct and informative as a noob.
do you have a link to the scene where this was inspired from? i havent watched it
lmgtfy is obnoxious, but seriously, this question does come up nearly once a week. Even a cursory reddit search or even just looking past a few pages should find a few posts on the topic. And the answer is pretty clear that people like PyCharm. I personally prefer a text editor and a terminal. But I may try out PyCharm too!
Post this in /r/learnpython. Have some dignity. 
Yep kind of annoying people dont even bother to search for things or even look at the sidebar...
Sublime and vim are not IDE's. They are text editors. Granted sublime has some cool plugins but you will not find a better comprehensive python development environment than pycharm. 
I tried to use an IDE like pycharm. But didn't work for me. I'm more comfortable with a text editor, first sublime text, and now Vim.
Very cool.. but you can also use `zsh` and just use history search to find your previous long command or create a alias :)
I just don't get why Google is neglecting Python, I guess Go is their priority now
It's not hotdog
if you need to interact with Excel but want to stay in `Python`, xlwings is pretty cool. It exposes almost all `VBA` apis in a pythonic fashion.. so you can combine that with any other library you want to use.
Do you use the `AREPL` while building the tool? perhaps that would give you immediate feedback what users would face when using the tool..
I would say Pycharm first otherwise if you’re on a Windows machine Visual Studio with the Python plugin.
True they are not.. but if you use them for a while.. you can pretty much get very close to `Pycharm` and a lot more (especially `VIM` and `emacs`).
Seems like there is a bot that tracks posts about bots.. haha..

thank you!!
The robots.txt does not necessarily match the technical measures put in place. It doesn't seem to disallow the login, but again, that might not mean it matches what they look to block. By looking at the response I would think you'd be able to tell because you'd be able to see what you're getting and picture what the page should look like from the source. When you right click and inspect, you get the rendered current DOM. Looking at job postings, it looks like they use Angular for the frontend, so the source code returned won't at all match the rendered DOM you see when you inspect. I'm not actually looking at the source myself, and they might use static pages for the content you want, but I'm guessing that's the issue. Instead of requests, you'll probably need to use an entire headless browser to render the page. If the website tries to prevent scraping, there is certainly a variety of ways to get in anyway. My brother scrapes Amazon despite the security measures in placing by using libraries that act like full web browsers, and there are people who have written articles about using speech recognition to defeat the audio captcha from Google (regarded as one of that most difficult to defeat bot-stopping measures on the web). You can also anonymize the requests with a library using tor nodes. However, every step you take to increase your circumvention of technical measures increases your legal exposure to being accused of unlawfully accessing an electronic system. Take care to look for terms of service and make sure you're following them. Luckily the robots file doesn't forbid you, so that's a start.
I've looked at it but the thing in the question says raw_unput is for integers And input() is for strings isn't that wrong as input treats it's content as variable. Where raw_input() takes it as str. I've done a CTF challenge where we took advantage of input() where there was a win() function and to call win() just type win() in input() and input doesn't treats it as a string and then calls win() and we get our flag. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33946678/python-how-to-hack-input This difference I know. I don't know if the original question's argument of raw_input() for ints and input() for strings ever existed so I thought I post it here but instead got -1 downvote
That means the above question is wrong right?
The one that works for you. There is no one magic ide that works for everyone. It's a personal choice. Lemme put it to you this way: If you're a mechanic, you have a preference for who makes your tools because you like the way they feel in your hand or work, or you just grew up using them. It's the same thing with an ide. Personally, I've been using vim for 15 years and have to use pycharm at my $dayjob. I am far more productive outside of work than I am at it because my tool allows me the flexibility to do what I need quickly. 
Yes .

You're not leveraging the session in any way in your code. And then beyond that you'll also likely need to handle CSRF token as well. Basically you'll need to do something along the lines of... * Start a session through 'GET' of the login page. * This session will include things you may need to login, like the CSRF token * Use said session to 'POST' credentials, CSRF token and any other requirements like the 'Referer' (sic), etc. * Once you have a valid session with all of the auth requirements of the site you're interacting with you can start to scrape. If you search for session examples using requests you'll find some good hints. Also, you can leverage requests-html to do any all in one now for dealing with the HTML return for the scraping portion of what you're trying to accomplish. 
I do, but ironically, most of the work in AREPL is done in javascript. I have a full-time job which gives me very little time for development, let alone extensive tests, so I listen to the users for feedback. Speaking of which - any feedback? :P
Thanks
Also interested. 
I haven't read the post and I understand what a matrix actually is but if you needed a matrix for a program what data structure would you use if not a 2d array
I loved the hell out of Rogue as a kid and have been thinking of trying my hand at a faithful recreation in Python. Unfortunately I'm going to be way too busy at the time this is going on. I'll be bookmarking all the resources that are posted though. Thanks a lot for sharing this!
Currently a math major but looking to get into a computer science career. This past week I got Ubuntu running as the main OS on my laptop (was scary, but so happy!) and currently learning Python from scratch from [this tutorial](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world). So far everything has gone smooth and I am just starting the section on databases. My better half is doing CS:50 right now and I will be joining her as soon as I finish this tutorial. Cheers all.
People also don't understand that's it's not just making it "close to Pycharm", or "close to &lt;INSERT IDE HERE&gt;". I use Sublime Text and after installing * PyYapf * Virtualenv * SublimeLinter-flake8 * SublimeREPL * SublimePythonIDE I'm already very close to using a dedicated IDE. But since I'm using a highly extensible text editor I get to work on every other kind of file. I can jump into a web extension project and it has code formatting, linting, snippets, autocompletion, AND a build system for all the js/html/css/json files involved. I can diff, merge and git from the editor. I can switch to any language and have near-IDE features. I work on all sorts of stuff. And for ALL of it I get it do my development from Sublime Text. As a result I'm becoming more proficient with it every day and my productivity never falters. Nothing sucks more than switching to a different project with a different language, and being pulled away from your comfort zone. Then having to relearn some other IDE with an unfamiliar interface and unfamiliar hotkeys. It's the reason I started using text editors. Was jumping back and forth between different Visual Studios (C#, Visual Foxpro), Codeblocks, Eclipse, and some others I can't even remember. Got sick of it. Two things happened as a result. I ended up with an amazing workflow without having 20 resource heavy IDEs installed, and I actually ended up knowing the languages better. Without the constant autocompletes and instant docs I had to actually read the reference material. It got me to learn all sorts of cool stuff I would have never known about. Plus when I would try to visualize solving a problem before getting to work I could already see how X feature or Y library could make it much easier. Which I didn't even know about before.
My favourite use of this is in an infinite counter: &gt;&gt;&gt; for i, _ in enumerate(iter(int, 1)): print(i) 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 ...

Can I just say, there are only 5 items. Although they are interesting. 
This is really nice. You might also wish to look at https://docs.python.org/2/library/itertools.html#itertools.count does the exact same thing.
You do you, but the paid versions of JetBrain's IDEs support a lot of different things natively, and a lot more with plugins. I like being able to do everything in basically the same program without having to do all the setup making it work together.
I've found some nice videos on YouTube from past PyCon's. 
Looks like your question is solved, but why are you using a 32 bit OS?
ahahah oh that's a good point, i just edited the article. Thanks for pointing that out : ) 
Cool, now django 2 will work?
Great write-up, but I'd also like to add: - The benefit of App Engine is security, scalability, ease of international access (i.e.: automatic deployment to servers in other countries), good monitoring tools, and higher - and more consistent - network speeds - A lot of Python 2 code is compatible with Python 3 code, although Python 3 does have a lot more (new) features that Python 2 doesn't have; a workaround is tedious but a vast majority of the improvements are mainly for developer time/speed (i.e.: specifying variable types in the method names that linters/compilers can catch, lambdas, dictionaries that maintain insertion order, etc.) - Some big libraries will stop supporting Python 2.7 (the latest version of 2.0) by 2019 or even earlier: Pandas, a very popular library for manipulating large sets of data, will stop supporting Python 2.7 by Jan 1st, 2019
How much Python does someone need to know to keep up? I've only taken two programing courses, but this does sound fun.
There's no such thing as unconditionally best development environment. It's predicated on your level of expertise with other tools, the amount of time you will be dedicating to programming, whether there is a requirement to supervise your environment, is there personnel to provide support to you, if you have problems with your environment. Of course, also factors like operating system, source code location and many more play a role. So, suppose you aren't good with computers in general, you don't know Python very well, and your job mostly revolves around building websites. Then something like PyCharm will work great for you. This is because it does a lot of hand-holding, has a lot of defaults and helpers pre-installed and pre-configured. Probably can even recognize popular web-frameworks. Suppose you know the language well, you mostly work on system / infrastructure of an in-house product, then PyCharm will be a hindrance to you, but something like Vim will work very well. Becasue the pre-configured stuff in PyCharm will be wrong almost all the time, it will mislead you by not providing auto-completion for available libraries, and providing auto-completion for things that aren't there. It will be generally too slow, unable to edit files over SSH, unable to even do syntax highlighting for half a dozen of other languages you are using together with Python etc.
Not much! You can even start from scratch, so having a bit of background already you'll be ahead of some.
What you're talking about seems to be database creation. https://support.office.com/en-us/article/create-a-data-model-in-excel-87e7a54c-87dc-488e-9410-5c75dbcb0f7b If you describe what your objective is, someone might chime in to point you in the right direction.

I have installed version 0.32.1 for jupyterlab. Is this the latest version? I am new to this and I can't figure out how to update jupyter. 
PhantomJS' development is suspended for now. Just like megaman821, said Chrome is probably one of the most if not the most stable way to print PDFs. Here is an unofficial port of puppeteer in python : https://miyakogi.github.io/pyppeteer/ (never used it though) 
Well, a better explanation would be to say that: 1. Typically, if a module name starts with an underscore, it means that it's actually a native extension (perhaps written in C and compiled into a shared library). 2. Specifically for `curses` library: the default MS Windows terminal cannot be used with the C `curses` library. But there are other terminals that can (for example, ConEmu, Mintty). So, if you really wanted this particular library, then, for example, installing CygWin + its version of Python would work. 3. There's a multiplatform version of `curses` for Python: https://pypi.org/project/UniCurses/ if you really want that kind of API, you could try it. 4. `termbox` is a modern alternative to `curses`, but Python version of it uses Python (slow) code for MS Windows default terminal and C (fast) code for terminals that support VT100 codes.
A reddit bot that takes the newest photo from a subreddit, manipulating it in a specific way and posting it to another. I've got it's basic funcitonality working, manipulating the images and connected to the reddit api. Now I just have to make the parsers for the different hosting sites that are used, and find a way to host it. If somebody could suggest a free way of hosting it it would be great. I cannot buy, and it's not really worth it, a pi. I've heard of heroku, is it's free plan with the restrictions enough for this type of bot. It's my first time making something like that so I am kinda lost.

What is the main difference between 3.5 and 3.7? Is this something like 2.7/3.x dichotomy? ;)

The accumulation of all those hacks and adaptations is how you end up at &gt;200 lines. It's kind of like advising someone to write their own calculator in &lt;200 lines of code because, *right now*, they only use addition of positive integers the sum of which will never exceed 32 bits... the more you try and use your tiny solution across multiple environments, the less your tiny solution will work without expanding in size. Which is just one of the many reasons why LoC count isn't a meaningful measure of code quality.

That’s valid Python syntax (although not good practice)
It depends what's meant by no libraries in python. Do the standard string functions like split count?
About to wrap up a script that takes my old local digital music collection and map that against Spotify and create a new playlist based on the input. Just did a quick test with about 1000 albums and it created a new playlist with 7500 songs in about 3min. 
3.6 has useful type hinting
[Weasyprint](https://weasyprint.org/) is another great python library for defining a layout with HTML and converting to PDF (but not sure if you will find the same difficulties as with pdfkit). I have written a library called [PDF-Reports](https://github.com/Edinburgh-Genome-Foundry/pdf_reports) on top of weasyprint which allows to use the Pug language instead of HTML for the layout (it's nicer to write), and embedding optionally Semantic-UI for reports stylings.
Maybe a bit heavy-handed for what you're trying to do but have a look at [sphinx-doc](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/). It was made for documenting Python projects but these days it works pretty well for stand-alone documents too.
Ah, unfortunately my company is still stuck on 2.7. While I use 3 myself I have to maintain compatibility which ties my hands. Things like async &amp; f strings are still abstract concepts for me.

Right, I'm following now. I thought you wanted to replicate the Data Model setup in Python. You want to export the PowerPivot data model, that's your actual question. There's a few solutions available: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25454355/exporting-data-from-powerpivot You can use VBA script to export to csv file then import into Python/R or you can use PowerBi if you have access to it.

I'm curious, where are you folks at these days in regards to the Python version you're using? I'm on my own project so I can afford moving along with newer versions (though I have been bitten by some new functions that appeared in 3.6 and would fail my Travis build on 3.5 :)) Python 3.6 is the right default but I'm having my eye on 3.7 features. Python has become quite awesome "again" :) I only wish it could support [pattern matching](https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-ideas/2018-May/050283.html) in th future, having used various forms in erlang and scala, I thought they were elegant and very handy. Finally, my main problem is still the packaging mess. I am sticking to pip+setuptools but I have found that having to explain to folks they must create virtual envs before they can even install/run your tool is scaring some folks away. I had hopes about [shiv](http://shiv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) but the project feels a little stale now unfortunately.

There is no correct answer to that. But also I could ask why not do it the decorator way ? I guess it's a question of design
Because generally decorators are not expected to do things immediately - they're expected to modify the function and then return it so the modified version can later be called somewhere else. You're using decorators for control flow here - they actually _do side-effectful stuff_ when called, and then pass the results of that to the decorated function, which makes the control flow way more obscure than it has any reason to be.
I would mention f-strings when talking about string.format. Its much nicer to use, and for beginners more intuitive as well. 
Recently discovered [readcomics.io](https://readcomics.io). Making a scraper to download and all of the issues into local pdfs for offline reading.
Also not mentioned so far is that 3.6 added f-strings, a new version of print formatting, that's probably the easiest to use yet.

You may have heard of [roaring bitmaps](https://roaringbitmap.org/). A roaring bitmap is a compressed bitmap, a very efficient data structures to represent an ordered set of integers (between 0 and 2^(32) \- 1). If you are interested in data structures, have a look at their publications and talks! [Pyroaring](https://github.com/Ezibenroc/PyRoaringBitMap/) is a Python implementation. It can be several orders of magnitude faster than the built\-in set, while taking much less memory. If your code relies heavily on integer sets, you should definitely give it a try. Technical details: Pyroaring is a Cython wrapper of the official C implementation, CRoaring.
Python is pretty shitty hobby as such. I'd rather you pick a project you want to complete and learn as you go. Learning to do shit with Python is actually pretty trivial, but actually finishing something is way harder (at least for me) 
Not true, Python 2 is in RHEL 7 and is subject to the normal RHEL support cycle. The depreciation notice means that in "future" versions of RHEL, it won't be supported.
I'm also doing the same and started uni at same age. Good luck! Stick to it. 
If anyone from pyside is reading this: Copying the code from your examples doesn't work. http://blog.qt.io/blog/2018/05/04/hello-qt-for-python/ Blank lines are all messed up, and multi-line statements are causing syntax errors.
Have you looked at https://numba.pydata.org/? Usually optimization works well for functions which operate on Numpy Arrays. Just decorate your function and profile to see whether you get a speed gain. Note that you should not use Python objects such as lists or dictionaries in a Numba decorated function. To enforce this, you can write @numba.jit(nopython=True) 
I use the newest version but I may stay on 3.6 until they fix the compulsory type annotations in data classes. In other news I mapped `usr/bin/python` to version 3 on the Mac, and nothing has broken yet.
I've been using appengine for a bunch of my projects for a decade now and it's been great. Sure every system has some kinks, but honestly considering how little i had to touch the apps in 10 years, it's pretty impressive. 
[removed]
First I read \`**Python 5.11**\`. Phew.
You should post this to r/learnpython. It's a little hard to see your problem without the rest of the code, but I don't see you setting parents anywhere or saving references to the objects you're creating. Save the objects you're creating in setupIU to the object instance, and pass your MainWindow as the parent to the ParameterTree. Also try removing the global call from the first line of change. If you're only using those position constants in this one place, make them class attributes on your main window. Additionally, you've got a typo p.param('arameters','Step Size').setValue(StepSize) 
It would be nice if the README was more fleshed out. Adding things like how to run, how to run tests, how to contribute are super useful for open source projects. Are you, or planning on, hosting this anywhere? 
What’s this in reference to?
Technically you are right but it didn't really work until 3.6 - and even now I m having trouble.
Maybe use pandoc. You could then generate simple markdown files and convert them with pandoc to pdf. Pandoc uses latex to produce pdfs and you can extend it with filters etc. The layout is then handled by the latex engine.
And 3.7 made hinting compulsory in data classed
No, it's nothing like that. But some new things I enjoy are pathlib, formatted strings and 20-25% faster dictionaries which are also sorted. There's also some improvements to asincio and typehints. To be fair the last one was back ported to 3.5

At the _very_ end, someone asks about `setup.py` and whether what Keith talks about will replace it. Answer: "No, `setup.py` is a completely different tool for different things. `setup.py is used for libraries, and this is for applications." What does he mean by that? What _is_ an application as opposed to a library?
VSCode works on Mac and Linux as well.

I write all of my code to use either 2.7 or 3.5+ so I have been stuck with a lot of `os.path.` bloat. I may start to enforce the requirement of the pathlib backport but I am not sure. Seeing your components image does make it even more attractive. I think the things that turned me off is that I like, by convention, to end all directories with a trailing `/` (I may be wrong but I do not think pathlib does this). I also did not like the ascetics of `/` as the join command though as I think about it, `+` may be confusing because of string concatenation. I also recall being turned off because a `Path` object was so similar but annoying different than what comes out of `os.scandir`. Then again, everything I am saying is based on a year-old recollection of some playing. To convert over my codes would be a long weekend of work (they are mostly personal projects) but may be worth it.
I love Qt. I think it's got the best documentation of any framework out there. Also, is PyQt no longer a thing?
Damn! I was writing Python 3.6 two days ago and it's already 5.11.
&gt; Manual Installation by Copying Project Files to site-packages This is a horrible idea. I can understand putting it for educational purposes, but it needs to come with a big disclaimer about never doing this. &gt; pip install –upgrade setuptools wheel This is *also* a horrible idea. You should *never* have pip touch anything managed by your distro's package manager; if you need different package versions, use `--local`. &gt; pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ printmsg Again, `--user`. IMO the [official Python Packaging User Guide](https://packaging.python.org) is still the best resource.
I wonder if their blog engine did that
I think they renamed it to "Qt for Python" to avoid confusion with other wrappers.
PtQt still lives but this project (pyside) is "official".
oh I see, thanks
Has anyone else tried to install PySide2 on windows 10? I am having trouble with the official wheels.

Yeah, found a summary of one of my article series on "https://heartbeat.fritz.ai/" as well the other day. I think this blog/website is about copying &amp; summarizing content from other websites ... In my case, they attributed the images that they re-used from my articles, but yeah, it should still say somewhere in bold at the beginning that this is **not original content**. 
Sure. Maybe. If you have no edge cases, you need no solutions for edge cases. But when someone is asking the OP's question, they're asking for a general solution that will *also* work in their entirely arbitrary environment, which more than likely will mean edge cases, because robust parsing of arbitrary posts is, almost definitionally, the handling of the inherent talent of humans to produce edge cases.

A 2D array is a data structure that can be used to represent a matrix of some sort. But it doesn't mean that a 2D array is a matrix. I mean, a Python list is not really a vector, and for the same reasons a NumPy 2D array is not the same as a matrix. Also, from a linear algebra perspective, even if NumPy adds some linear-algebra functions, it breaks with a lot of linear algebra rules and concepts. E.g., you can't do matrix multiplication between a matrix and a vector, yet, if you consider a 1D array a vector and a 2D array a matrix, it seems possible in NumPy. I am not saying that array data structures are bad or not useful -- quite the contrary (think of how much notational work broadcasting saves), but one shouldn't confuse beginners by saying that an x-dimensional array data structure is equal to an x-dimensional tensor
Data classes themselves are not compulsory though. You could simply not use them. Seems like you don't like data classes for the opposite reason I don't like them; they don't enforce their type hints at all and allow arbitrary attribute assignment (i.e. don't define `__slots__` ). If it wasn't for the constructor and `__repr__` they generate for you, they would be basically no better than just doing `class MyType: pass`
You have my attention. Dunder methods?
Are there any major differences between Qt for Python and PyQt? Will I just be able to use the import interchangeably?
The methods that let your class interface with builtin python functions. The most well known examples are __repr__ which returns a string representation of the object, whenever you just call the object inside the shell(eg you have a class Coords, that stores teo values as xy coordinates, your repr could return “Coords(xvalue, yvalue)” __len__ gets called when you call len(YourObject) __str__ when you call str(object) __add__ __mul__ etc give support for built in operators There are many more
All I want is to be able to build into Android with Qt for Python, like you can already with Qt.
PyQt is more mature, but has licensing issues (it is GPL or commercial, while PySide is LGPL, GPL, or commercial).
Split can be used. I can use only Python 2.7 default libraries

I personally read physical comics (and only started this past year), but I need to start tightening my budget so I started looking at online services and came across the site, so I had not heard of cbr files previously. Since the site displays each issue as a series of jpegs, it seemed trivial to save all of the jpegs locally and then mash them all into a PDF. I'll have to look into cbr and see how easy it is to take those jpegs and make a cbr file from. Thanks!
Tip: Computer Science is much more than programming and engineering. Since you're from a math background, try out CS subjects like Automata theory, Algorithms, Datastructures and Complexity theory, Compilers, and Machine Learning.
More low effort spam
Cbr files are in general a renamed rar file so it should not be any problem to create it instead of a PDF.
There will be some changes if you're using stuff like UIC, but the API of the Qt classes themselves is largely the exact same. 
go to /r/learnpython and search for project idea...
Maybe try some data visualization? Reading data out of a csv/tsv and visualising it? A web app? You could dip into some front end languages. Have fun with whatever you decide!
Tried with Colab yet? I did before posting and not coming up with much. 
Awesome! Thanks so much. 
Today, [``forge``](http://github.com/dfee/forge) received a major update that includes a ground-up redesign of architecture and documentation. This redesign takes into account feedback received from the [initial release](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/8m2mjw/introducing_dfeeforge_dynamic_python_signatures/). ``Forge`` allows you to add, remove or modify parameters as well as providing argument value conversion, validation, and default generation. For example, to generate method-specific ``requests`` functions in about [10% the code](https://github.com/requests/requests/blob/991e8b76b7a9d21f698b24fa0058d3d5968721bc/requests/api.py): import forge import requests request = forge.copy(requests.Session.request, exclude='self')(requests.request) def with_method(method): revised = forge.modify( 'method', default=method, bound=True, kind=forge.FParameter.POSITIONAL_ONLY, )(request) revised.__name__ = method.lower() return revised post = with_method('POST') get = with_method('GET') put = with_method('PUT') delete = with_method('DELETE') options = with_method('OPTIONS') head = with_method('HEAD') patch = with_method('PATCH') Also, unlike their official ``requests`` counterparts, these functions have complete signatures.
A technique to naively parsing this type of stuff in Python IMO is Read each line Filter out the extraneous data such as [ ] and ( And then keep iterating over the remaining items until splitting them until you have your components. Like splitting based on ), and then on , But if you have access to the default libraries, you can also use the re package and use patterns to return groups that match the regex.
The main difference for developers is LGPL vs GPL licensing, IMO, and the fact that this is officially supported by upstream.
Working on developing supply chain network optimization tool using PULP module and using CPLEX dropsolve solver, tried using open source CBC solver but it is not as good as commercial solvers to solve MIP solvers.
I think making a MUD from scratch is a great exercise in learning about multi user platforms and networking in general no mater the language. Networking is hard and has many gotchyas that are fun to work through.
As someone who doesn't know C++, I wish their documentation for PyQt was translated to python rather than just linking to the C++ doc.
This too is my wish.
Sorry I'm an idiot. It was QtWidgets....dammit.
Didn't celery come from Django originally?
it seems like there is a blog thing, but there are some examples inside the oficial repository of the project and also on this wiki page: [https://wiki.qt.io/Qt\_for\_Python/Tutorial](https://wiki.qt.io/Qt_for_Python/Tutorial) including the clickable button example that there is on the official website. I think the blog post Hello Qt for Python is the same as the last example inside the "simple clickable button" example.
I think one of the main points behind this for PyQt and PySide is that the API is the same as the C\+\+, in the sense of methods and classes (of course with a few differences). In both projects there is a gap of showing a simple example of how to use each class, so I guess you need to rely on tutorials that can be found around.
Just look at the PySide docs in that case. They are practically identical, but the example code is all Python.
IMHO they are the same, I have seen some differences in the wiki page of PySide, when they display which bindings are present in PyQt but no on PySide, besides that, I have not found major differences: [https://wiki.qt.io/Qt\_for\_Python\_Missing\_Bindings](https://wiki.qt.io/Qt_for_Python_Missing_Bindings) Also I noticed that the latest stable release for PyQt is based on Qt 5.10, and PySide has 5.11 could it be that PyQt dev is 5.11 ? I don't know

i have to profit from programming really soon or my life will become CRAP!! i feel lost when i talk to you i just picked up "algorithms in a nutshell" by george t heineman. Hope this helps me.
Data science is a word that covers a lot of stuff. A common form of data science is the analysis of website traffic and various stuff like A/B testing and analytics of browsing, and more recently natural language processing, but there are more sophisticated forms as well in science or financial forecasting, not to mention various automation with deep learning. The former things I'd rate as technically the easiest and with some programming skills and basic statistics you can learn the subject matter either by self-study or some online learning (on that note I've heard good things about [this Coursera program](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science) ). One thing you shouldn't underestimate is the value of a recognizable degree in this area. So self-study is great, but it limits your ability to get through the superficial review that human resource departments often do. Finally, the more advanced types of data science and machine learning are tougher and you can pick up basics on your own I'm sure, but without at least an undergraduate degree in a quantitative science or engineering this will be tough to master and be professionally competitive in.

That's a nice article. I think it would extra value if you would add confidence intervals to the accuracy values and maybe have a bar plot next to it that shows the training and/or test time for each model. This way, one could see if the improvement in performance is relevant and get a feeling for how much longer/faster it is to obtain the results
One of the greatest advances in programming languages is the modularity of code and by extension the ability to use libraries to avoid having to re-invent the wheel. I other words, you should definitely use a library for this and get past this "hate" of "plug-ins or nuget" (by which I assume you mean libraries because plug-ins aren't really a thing in python). Where you should be pointed depends on what type of web page you're wanting to scrape. A minimal starting point is the requests library along with the beautifulsoup library.
Is it technically possible to rebuild this with shiboken configured to create bindings with python's semantically communicative capitalization conventions? This still feels like a friend coming over to help me move, but also kicking me in the balls and saying "you're welcome."
Very useful info! 
Oh. Forgot I was speaking to the supreme Court. Could you understand what I was asking? 
Thank you for your input. I really appreciate it. 
my code was messy. you know, most php beginners don't separate html and php. they don't use a clear structure like model view controllers and so on ...
The hostname isn't found, but then you are trying to print it. If you haven't initialized the hostname variable outside of the posted section, and nothing causes it to be initialized within this section, it isn't defined.

Thank you, it's a very good advice!
I believe the mail developer is active in this thread. Perhaps he can help. 
I'm somewhat distracted from the algorithm by the fact that you're using attribute assignments to mutate an instance of a `namedtuple` class (after an `global` statement that's unnecessary if you can modify the object in place). That obviously can't work, since the instance is immutable (like a tuple). I'm sure you know that too, and were using something like `gil = gil._replace(locked=False)` at some point (making the `global gil` line necessary). Perhaps you could use [`types.SimpleNamespace`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/types.html#types.SimpleNamespace) to define the `gil` record instead? It's a good type to use if you want to use attribute syntax to interact with a mutable container.

Thanks! Shame on me, I just wanted to refactor my code to make it easier to understand and forgot that namedtuple is immutable.
I'm doing a freelance project that requires some webscraping. I'm new to Python and just completed the "automate the boring stuff with Python" course but I am a bit stuck. Anyone here willing to take a look and help?
Nice.
I do quite a bit of this type of work at my day job &amp; see a couple of things right off the bat. 1. Imagemagick 7 now uses the magick command, so you should stipulate installing Imagemagick 6 to use convert or change the code to call magick instead 2. Increase the dpi! 300ppi is the minimum you’d want to use for OCR so you should increase your default setting. What about skewed pages, images with uneven lighting? Your code assumes a perfect File to start from 3. Personal pet peeve: please be consistent with the extensions and use 3 character extensions everywhere (ex. tif instead of tiff)
A task I have to do at work involves getting two numeric values from a program and subtracting them from 100 to get a third value that I then have to enter into the program. Before we had to do it all manually by opening up calculator on the computer etc. So I wrote a short script that grabs the data automatically from the program, does the small bit of processing on it and produces the value I need. I used the win32clipboard module's SetClipboardText function to send the value right to clipboard so I don't even have to copy it from the console
Don't post a link for people to download an executable. If you're going to share something you've created, post the source code or link to a sandboxed environment where the code is executed.

PySide actually has [reasonable python docs](https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qtforpython/PySide2/QtWidgets/QTableView.html). 
does RenPy count?
Really cool! This feels like class inheritance on steroids, since it's more\-so ad hoc lifting of signatures I'd want to use and reforging them into something domain specific. I look forward to trying this out with work :)
`print` is now a class
I totally recommend using beautiful soup. It is quite easy to get through python pip. $ pip install bs4 and you are done. Documentation: https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/ I 've been using it with python 2.7 and it is very powerful. 
I can't tell. The description is too coy: &gt; Ren'Py is a visual novel engine – used by thousands of creators from around the world – that helps you use words, images, and sounds to tell interactive stories that run on computers and mobile devices. Come on. Is it a game engine or not?
I never found a good online course. The books you can get are far superior, and instead of having to satisfy some vague criterion on the website, the books spell out what your objective is and how to get here. Learn Python the Hard Way Automating the boring stuff with python Python crash course Pick one, go through it, if you don't like it pick another one. 
Okay thanks for telling me
Just use sentdex youtube tutorial and for beginner and he also has more advance tutorial. Content there is great! Like the above comment, whatever you pick stick to it and finish it. 
No problem. The No Starch Press books are some of my favorites. 
It was used to make Doki Doki Lit Club, and the creator uses the word "engine". Its obviously not as generalized as others, but it would be cool to see someone frankenstein it into their rouge like for cut scenes :p
That's a pretty cool idea.
I will search it
Alright, I'll check him out! 
There is one on edX from MIT which I think is pretty good. I’m not a programmer and just learning for fun though. 
That's kind of where I'm at, and what inspired this line of thinking. Thanks for weighing in!
This is literally the only time I've come across a Python library (as opposed to an app that uses many libraries) requiring env vars to be set. I think it'd be easier to fix Click than all the Python tooling involved in running Flask, etc.
That doesn't seem to be the case. It looks pretty great, though! Still, I imagine it'd be hard to get Click's current consumers switched to something other than Click. I think it'd be a lot easier to get them to adopt a Python 3\-native version of Click instead. For instance, pipenv already recommends running on Python 3.
Awesome! What do you do? Here are my responses to your points: 1. Could you perhaps reword this a bit differently? I am not sure what you mean by "stipulate installing Imagemagick 6". Also, what method do you mean by "call magick instead"? Perhaps I am just missing something there. 2. Gotcha! That makes sense to do. Also: you are absolutely right. Honestly, when I first set out to make this, I had documents which were "perfect". These are great things to keep in mind \- do you have any suggestions on how I may handle things like skewed pages or uneven lighting? 3. Why is this a pet peeve? Anyhow, thank you so much for the critique! I greatly appreciate it and I hope to hear from you again. 
Thank God for the GIL. It is the only thing keeping us from the takeover. ;)
I knew the Winamp versioning system would take off!
Text python files has been disabled. Python now only reads object files written by other sentient python instances.
EMACS.
Check out r/learnpython
And here I am still using python 3. When will the devs share their python 5?
def is now a function 
Yeah, what have you tried and post it here otherwise we don't want to do your job for you.
Wow, thanks a ton. After days of trying and failing, I finally logged in, and can see so in my response file. I hope I got this right; in simplified terms: The **request** package accesses the webpage's **source code**, which contains the HTML for that webpage. This code does not change, regardless of the browser or OS. The **selenium** package accesses the webpage's **DOM** (document object model) code, which contains the webpage's HTML *in addition* to modification from the website's front-end development (e.g. javascript, angular). The DOM can be accessed by right-clicking and selecting "inspect", and the DOM can vary across different platforms.
I also like the intro to programming from MIT’s open courseware. You can take the whole first semester class that a freshman at MIT would take. Has both practical application and good CS theory as well.
is the content online anywhere, or are you just trying to get the kickstarter funded?
What was the error?
That's basically right. Because Selenium is automating a browser for you, it has a lot of capabilities like parsing the HTML into a document, grabbing linked JavaScript, running the JavaScript, and modifying the document based upon instructions from the JavaScript. Now, you might be able to get away without using Selenium if it is too slow for your purposes, but it sounds like you're off to a good start.
Is this a tool to auto-deepfry memes? Because it sounds like a tool to auto-deepfry memes. Also trial accts for hosting services are good. Save up while you use one or two months worth of trials. 
Second on Automate the Boring Stuff (it's available free online). It glosses over a lot but it's how I started and even as a very unskilled user I find it extremely helpful for automating stuff. Between that, the Python documentation, and Wikipedia, the only time I've ever felt at a total loss was on lambda stuff.
Manage a digitization lab at a university library. 1. https://www.imagemagick.org/script/command-line-processing.php Your code makes a call to the program convert, this is an imagemagick version 6 program. In the most recent version of imagemagick (which is what an apt-get should pull using your shell install script) the convert command has been deprecated for magick. 2. Get lots of types of images and test imagemagick commands such as thresholding and levels adjustments to see how your output could be improved. Imagemagick actually deskews, but you might learn more by implementing something in Python. Google for tutorials! 3. Consistency goes a huge way towards maintainable code, especially when multiple people are involved. Every other extension you use is 3 characters in length. 
I was referring to Visual Studio Community or Pro. Python is not supported on Mac.
I Like this one a lot for entry level stuff. It's not exactly a comprehensive course, but it is tailored to be complete in 3 months or less. [http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/thinkcspy/index.html](http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/thinkcspy/index.html)
no it isn't ;)
That's a good idea actually, I might write a different article about those
Why use a generator if all you are doing is looping infinitely? It makes more sense to use a nested function. If you want to use a generator as a state machine, you can always return the `send` method from the outer function.
Why on earth would you post a link directly to an executable?
As a side note, Python 3.7's new [dataclass](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/dataclasses.html#module-dataclasses) seems like it would be handy here. It's kinda designed to fill the need for a mutable namedtuple: @dataclass class Gil: drop_request: bool = False locked: bool = True switch_number : int = 0 last_holder : int = None eval_breaker : bool = True def take(): ... def drop(): ... def execution_loop(...): gil = Gil() #... use gil.take(), etc. 
That sounds so fascinating \- what particular subset of digitization? Books? Documents? Images? 1. Ah! I was not aware of that deprecation! Thank you! 2. Gotcha \- that is a great start. As you can probably guess, I am not terribly familiar with the imagemagick module; I will dig deeper into the documentation there. 3. That makes a lot of sense. The only reason why I kept it that way was because I thought it would be confusing to *not* have ".tiff" as ".tiff" \- do you see my argument there or what do you think? Thanks for the great responses. 
Audit the Coursera Specialization "Python for Everyone" (free).
So the AI spawns child interpreters who battle it out across multiple generations to improve and become the one true python. Reminds me of a certain species... 
We do everything. 2. Everyone’s gotta start somewhere. I suggest you take a look at some of Fred’s scripts. In particular: http://www.fmwconcepts.com/imagemagick/textdeskew/index.php http://www.fmwconcepts.com/imagemagick/textcleaner/index.php 3. It’s 1 less character to process if you want to think of it that way. Standard practice in my field is .tif, just like how it’s .jpg instead of .jpeg. 
RHEL7 is switching to python3 as default in the next release.
Well, ggplot is way better than matplotlib. It's way easier to do stuff in ggplot
Yes, that doesn't conflict with what I said
Try http://ProgramArcadeGames.com or http://arcade-book.readthedocs.io/
I followed the Coursera course [Learn to Program](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learn-to-program/). It assumes you know nothing more than basic math to start, and I thought it was pretty good as an intro to Python.
&gt; I don't like a requirement of a feature that was added that didn't replace any other feature and that I don't have to use, so I don't want to use it. FTFY

Data science in terms of Natural Language Processing and Generation as it relates to contracts and other legal documents is set to explode I think. Big companies use lawyers and coders now to generate, read, and process too many legal documents for humans to do by hand. So your background could make you useful if you find an in. 
Of course. And use lolcat: https://pypi.org/project/lolcat/

I haven't read any of the linked resources, but I would highly recommend you take a look at the 'importlib' and 'pkgutil' modules from the standard library. They give you a much better mechanism for programmatically importing modules without having to list the file system or know the specific import path. Some combination of 'pkgutil.walk_packages' and 'importlib.import_module' will get you what you want in a much more safe and sane manner than 'from foo import *'.

What did find is best? 
Automate the boring stuff with python. 
That’s where I stopped today. Thx
I recommend Dash/Plotly.
You finished it ? Let me know what you graduate to. 
You have keys body and accountid in the outer. Deserialize (json.loads) those as a dict "data". Then deserialize the value from data.get("body")? Best effort as I am on mobile.
Thanks. You're right I got the `.parents` sequence all wrong. `.parents[0]` actually returns the same as `.parent` and each subsequent element moves 1 level up the directory tree. I've fixed the image now.
Start in /r/learnpython. This has been done before. You can read others' code too. 
Most of programming is about identifying obstacles and overcoming them one by one by one .....by one.... and so on. Start with identifying what you don't know. Keep it vague at first, then narrow down your focus as the problems get more specific. example: Do you know how to program? Do you know how to program python? Do you know how to run a program always, all the time? Can you make it a bot that's always in a channel? Can you make it listen to what is typed? Do you know how to respond to text typed in? Can you send a message back to the channel? 
Whales?
If I were you I stick my head in deep the documentation and stackoverflow. I'm going to say it again, learn to read the documentation from the start! It will save you so much heart ache that you wouldn't understand. It's the best source for your problems. Start small. What really got me going was web scraping content and gathering the information in neat excel files. You will learn very much the basics of it. Now I'm very much fluent in Python and to be honest every programing language looks the same now. The mystery is long gone because I read the documentation. Documentation, documentation, documentation. Cheers. 
That is indeed pretty short!
It sounds very doable and possibly an enjoyable experience. Take a look at Jupyter Notebooks, they will give you a very solid start point and an easy platform to write for. 
sqlite?
If you are using requests, it would be something like this - import json, requests ... raw_json = requests.get(aws_link).json() json_dict = json.loads(raw_json['data'])
It can be hard to avoid things in open source. Do you reject useful PRs because they contain code you don't like? 
pymeasure is pretty great.
 I was hoping a NOSQL option may be possible. But it is starting to look like a SQLite is my best option. It means I will have to add some extra database creation / maintenance code. But I guess the ability to normalise the data structure will make things a bit more familiar (coming from a MySQL background).
How would you recommend I get an in? Like how should I prepare?
Ooo that looks appealing, unfortunately my hardware only supports python 2

Is the interval always a static value?
For this project, I'm avoiding adding any bloat. As it is, the only reason I am doing this at all is that the delay of downloading/parsing each RSS/XML file for each query it too long. I may opt to simply cache the RSS files and see if that is enough of an improvement. Since the RSS/XML files are already sorted in reverse chronological order, no processing is required to work out which one is the most recent. The major feature of using a database was going to be I could track which episodes have already been listened to. This would have made it a bit more like a 'real' podcast client. Since most of the podcasts I listen to are not serials, I haven't bothered too much with episode management. But this project may encourage me to start listening to more serial podcasts.
Python is a fine language for this. You might look at https://www.renpy.org/ if you are going for a 'novel' feel.

Double the [renpy](https://www.renpy.org) suggestion. You will mostly be writing in its own language (which is mostly even easier than Python), and Python is beautifully integrated in case you need some complex logic, minigames or something like that. It's mostly a VN system, but we've used it for the [interactive fiction prototype](https://github.com/SynedraAcus/ShipsAndShits) (CAUTION: it's entirely in Russian!) with a card game in it, and it works like a charm.
I'm the author of ocrmypdf, so I've worked on problems in the IR space for some time. If you're dealing with court documents there is likely a mixed bag of PDFs scanned without OCR, scans with OCR, and pure digital files. PDF seems to be the most common format for court documents. For PDFs you really want to extract the digital text if it's there instead of OCR. Rasterize+OCR is never as good as the original. What I would suggest is to standardize your PDFs, or possible all your input files, to PDFs with text, whether the text came from OCR or was always there. ``ocrmypdf --skip-text`` implements this; if a page has text already it will skip OCR on that page only. You can then use Ghostscript with ``-sDEVICE=txtwrite`` or the Python package ``pdfminer.six`` to extract text from PDFs. If there's existing OCR you might or might not want to redo it. ocrmypdf does images to PDF (although I recommend img2pdf for anything but basic cases, since it avoids transcoding while ImageMagick always seems to do lossy transcoding) and PDF/A conversion. I realize you're probably interested in files that aren't PDFs too, but I think the principle still applies that you should aim to extract digital data where possible to get the cleanest input for whatever analysis you're going to do. I also suggest moving to Ubuntu 18.04. It provides Tesseract 4.0.beta1 which is a huge improvement in speed and quality over 3.0. 
I remember trying to do this on a Tandy Color computer in the 80s. It ran out of memory. It only had 8K. 
sqlite ? comes bundled with Python. 
Learning programming is good, but not necessary for this. You can use an existing interactive fiction platform, and it will be much easier. https://itsfoss.com/create-interactive-fiction/

Yes, but you can adjust it at any time via `sys.setswitchinterval`. 
&gt; what op is reddit challenged. :p you're not a python developer until you've developer a command line / prompt / text based application or two. take a look at cmd and urwid. 
From the comment on the actual GIL at the end of the post: &gt; The `interval` value is available for the user to read and modify using the Python API `sys.{get,set}switchinterval()`. Static as in constant across all imstances, yes; static as in never changing, not necessarily.
If you ask /r/python/ whether python is a good choice, they will say yes. And it is completely doable! But if the goal doesn't include learning python, you're probably better off starting with an existing authoring system for [interactive fiction](https://www.ifarchive.org/) such as [inform](http://inform7.com/).
As a Mechanical Engineer that created some photo-acquisition software that needed a GUI, I recommend [wxPython](https://www.wxpython.org/). I tried a lot of the other ones, and wxPython was the one that got me where I needed to be very quickly.
No, but as I was making it I discovered that it was arleady done by someone, so, I am gonna finish this in my own way and probably do a deep-fry one later. Thanks for the idea!!
Suggest that you just use attrs from which python 3.7's dataclass is derived. That way you get a mutable replacement for NamedTuples. Attrs works for python 2 and python 3.3,4,5,6 and upcoming 7. Has a lot more features than dataclasses, with fewer irritants. https://attrs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/ On the plus side, I see the new dataclass implementation as python 3.7+'s way forward towards replacing NamedTuples. And I like its programmability hooks, which remind me of the latter day Enumeration features. However, dataclasses wont be much good for cleaning up a legacy code that is 3.6 or less. For that you need Attrs. I stopped using NamedTuples a long time ago because... - they're slow (try using a lot of em on your smartphone apps) - they have pickling issues - they're immutable.
Did you even try googling "python chatbot" or reading the sidebar? No, of course you didn't.
Small pet project of mine that takes text and turns it into images and vice versa. Uses 3-character blocks of text as RGB values to set the color of the pixels. Pretty cool to see what something like the Odyssey looks like in a visual form. Plus since you can convert back and forth with it, it can be used for coded messages if you're into that sort of thing.
I've used this project, and it's definitely a good choice! But I don't want to introduce an external dependency in such a simple and educational script. Not all Python users are familiar with `attrs,` and it takes additional time to learn about it.
I personally have been using SoloLearn to learn not only Python, but also Java and Kotlin. 
I had one of these in a shared office when first getting into mechanical keyboards, my poor office mate. New switches do feel better, but the buckling spring was fun!
&gt; It is common to use lambdas instead of partial No, `lambda` and `partial` are not equivalent. `lambda` is "late binding", just like a function, and unlike `partial`. What you wrote is equivalent to this: def f(): print(_) global _ data = [] for _ in range(3): data.append(f) for func in data: func() Written like that your result makes complete sense, right? --- If you have more questions like this it's better to post them on /r/learnpython. Include which version of python and what OS you are using. 
It "doesn't work as expected" the first time because it prints the value of `_` after the loop finished (at which point it is equal to 2). Python's `for` loop doesn't create fresh variable every iteration, it assigns to the same variable the result of iterator.
Omg that second link is amazing.
You might also look into the various non-python platforms for developing interactive fiction. For games that use a command and response style interface the [Inform 7](http://inform7.com/) system is often used. It has a nice development environment and a natural language like coding syntax. For games that have more of a branching structure the [Twine](http://twinery.org/) development system is very good.
That's actually still just a generator. `next(gen)` is equivalent to `gen.send(None)`. Coroutines are a new feature introduced in python 3.5 (and backported through the `asyncio.coroutine` decorator to 3.4) that allows multiple functions to execute concurrently in one thread. You can read more about them [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html).
What’s the beef with LabView? 
This will be your Bible. https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/
I am doing that now after recommendation from reddit. Can fully recommend as well. 
If you don't feel like reading pep8 conventions, you could always download some plugin for a code editor that automatically converts python code into pep8 format. Sublime text has a pep8 formatter.
I know there's a lot of stuff done in Twine so I gave it a try last year to see what the deal is ... I was very underwhelmed. The one thing it has going for it is that has a visual map that shows all the connections between your pages. But other than that, it seems like if you have *any other development environment* for making web pages or UI, you're probably just as well using that.
yeah even micropython needs more than 8kB RAM 😉
It was Color Basic back then. 
Sorry you got downvoted fam. Unfortunately, this sub starts frothing at the mouth whenever someone suggests that there are situations where it isn't feasible to use python3.
thanks, I now understands that closures are not working well inside for loops
Thanks for the links! Is there somewhere an example for matplotlib plots created from.data read from a file? I mean this is all well and good but most times data comes from a file with a number of columns and one needs to plot for example column 2 against column 1 and column 5 against column 3. How do you do that? I know how to do this in gnuplot but I would like to learn how to do it with matplotlib
Full SQL can be surprisingly cheap. If Python is reasonable to run on the system, sqlite will almost certainly be fine.

This article is so masterfully devoid of any content. 
Check out 'Pandas' for python. I think it's exactly what you need: https://pandas.pydata.org
You can also store the information as a JSON file and use python dictionary methods for your sorting/filtering needs.
Point taken wrt the objective of this script. For educational purposes, if you put data classes in your example, they're going to have to invest a considerable amount of time learning how to use this subset of its features (the NamedTuple equivalent), more than they would for Attrs. They will have to spend time figuring out how 'typing' works, since it is mandatory with dataclasses but not with attrs. Not everyone is into using typed parameters. Bottom line for me is that more time would be spent in the docs learning python 3.7's data classes than if they used Attrs for the same sub feature. So yes, go ahead and use data classes, but maybe with a side note about Attrs for those who are not into 'typing' or are not using python 3.7 'cause it hasn't hit the streets yet and they want to play around some with your code on python 3.6
Microsofts MSDN do a good job of having examples in multiple languages under separate tags
Are you aware that Numpy, Pandas and all data analysis packages stop Python 2 support at the end of 2018 (some 2019)?
PyQt is a third party library available under GPL and proprietary licenses you can buy It's not available under a more liberal license like Qts LGPL that let's you write distributable closed source apps unless you want to buy a commercial license PySide is available under the LGPL, that is its main advantage. The main disadvantage is that it was abandoned and didn't have support for QT5(only supporting qt4), now they're supporting it again
Nothing made my crappy python habits less crappy faster than the immediate feedback of a decent pep8 nag in my editor of choice (vim).
Former ME turned software engineer here, get on the phone with your equipment manufacturer and beg for python 3 support. Also pyqt is awesome, especially if you want to do any kind of real time plots, which pyqtgraph is pretty good at. It's a little complex at first but there is tons of content to help you get started.
PEP8 is a good starting point for literal code formatting. For more "how to write Python instead of writing Java in Python", look at the following in no particular order. There should be good information in the standard library documentation, as well as information and guides elsewhere. - Descriptors, both the builtins and how to make your own - Generators and the iterable/iterator protocols - Decorators - Metaclasses (advanced but very useful in niche cases) - Generator expressions and list/set/dictionary comprehensions - Operator overloading and dunder methods (dunder meaning *d*ouble *under*score, which appears at the beginning and end of each method name. For example `+` is overloaded with `__add__` and `__radd__`.) If you miss static typing, check out annotations (language feature which is commonly used for type hints) and a type hinter like mypy. A note here is that Python is duck-typed, and even with type hints it still is - the hints just let you make sure that your "duck" can actually walk and quack like a duck before runtime. On a similar note about types, literally everything is an object. Objects, "primitives", functions, classes, modules, everything. Use that to your advantage - for example, don't be shy about higher-order functions. Python in one word is flexible. Everything, from [arithmetic operators](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#emulating-numeric-types) to [object creation](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__new__) to [attribute lookup](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__getattr__) to [instance/subclass checks](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#customizing-instance-and-subclass-checks) to even [how the `import` keyword works](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/sys.html#sys.meta_path), is in your hands. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPiWg5jSoZI) is an excellent talk that covers a lot of the things I listed above and culminates in XML being converted and executed as Python code at runtime. How crazy is that? What other language lets you get your hands in the machinery of the language like that? Truly effective Python is about using the tools available to you to work magic behind the scenes and produce beautiful, concise code as a result.
python cookbook the second version has many good tips
It's utter bullshit. The only reason it's so widespread is massive lobbying and the fact that you can sell it easily during a simple presentation to stupid people in manager positions who will never ever work with it themselves. The clumsyness of its graphical programming language is mind boggling. Besides that I have yet to encounter a maintainable LabVIEW program and by now I think it's the flawed system itself instead of the poor PhD student who implements the same thing over and over again until the new PhD student starts.
I’ve had success with pyqt and pyqtgraph
I've chosen `SimpleNamespace` because of simplicity and left a comment that it's basically a dictionary. I'm not planning to replace it with data classes :).
Dash and or plotly only do graphing though right? Coming from learning react recently, dash was insanely nice for making graphs and stuff. I would definitely suggest it for that.
I've chosen `types.SimpleNamespace` because of its simplicity and I'm not planning to replace it with data classes.
Cool!

I suggest you start with brain.js. Super simple to use and very interesting
I can't provide much help for Python GUI's but as a former ME and now software engineer I wish you luck! I was doing a similar project and ended up switching careers after.
Can you elaborate a little on what those distinctions mean? 
Pytorch
Try using pyqt and a script thats freeware called PyGMI 3.0. It supports python 2.7 and I used it last summer and works amazingly
You could have a look at learn python the hard way. It's a book that teaches python through the development of a text game. Depending on your level it might be a good start. It assumes zero python knowledge.
take your upvote, frothmouth. 
Watch this talk (and others) by Raymond Hettinger (one of the core Python devs): https://youtu.be/wf-BqAjZb8M It's amazingly educational, and actually gives examples of replacing Java idioms with more Pythonic alternatives.
why it's spam?? did you checked the link??
You want to have a ".before_request" function registered for your application (or blueprint-by-blueprint) that performs user auth. (Flask-Login is great for managing the session itself) I find it helpful to create a @no_auth decorator which assigns an attribute ignoring auth to a particular route function, for things like landing pages, login pages, password reset, etc. that may live within the same blueprint. 
The answer is quite simple, if you adopt a Pythonic style of the classes/methods then you lose all the compatibility from the C\+\+ side of Qt. Having the same API, then you can easily read any Qt/C\+\+ code and translated it to Qt/Python. I don't know of any magical flag that does that, but I think you will need to patch shiboken to provide a functionality to rename methods, then you can add it into the typesystem.
May I ask which platform you are on? Pasting the code from the examples you link to works for me on Linux.
&gt; You want to have a ".before_request" function registered for your application (or blueprint-by-blueprint) that performs user auth. (Flask-Login is great for managing the session itself) That's true, but I usually prefer to implement these details myself instead of depending on external tools as it helps to learn and know the framework better. &gt; I find it helpful to create a @no_auth decorator which assigns an attribute ignoring auth to a particular route function, for things like landing pages, login pages, password reset, etc. that may live within the same blueprint. So, do you register the `.before_request()` fist and then add the `@no_auth` for the exceptional cases?
Yes, and you can probably use something like [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/) for that.
Which piece of hardware? Also how are you sending the data? I assume it's over a socket vs being one program, in which case you use 2 different versions of python. I'm also surprised any sort of DAQ would use python.

I really recommend Enaml (http://blink1073.github.io/enaml/docs/get_started/introduction.html ). It's a really pleasant way to build complex GUIs. You can embed matplotlib plots right out-the-box. The framework is built on PyQt so you can also add other Qt-based widgets (e.g. PyQtGraph) is you need. For application-based plots, I also recommend Chaco but this has a slightly steeper learning curve and needs the traits/enable/traits-enaml packages. See http://blink1073.github.io/enaml/docs/examples/ex_mpl_canvas.html or http://blink1073.github.io/enaml/docs/examples/ex_vtk_canvas.html Enaml can be installed on python-2 or python-3 from the anaconda python distribution (or miniconda, if you want a more minimal python install). Whatever GUI library you use, anaconda/miniconda is the distribution to use for scientific or engineering apps. PS. I also tried a UEI DAQ card (about a decade ago; the drivers/apis were rubbish then. We gave up and moved back to NI cards) and have many years experience with NI-DAQmx. Python is a great platform for building data-acquisition apps. 
Here's a decent summary on LGPL vs GPL, from [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1114045/gpl-and-lgpl-open-source-licensing-restrictions): &gt; LGPL allows you to use and distribute the open source software with your application without releasing the source code for your application. &gt; GPL requires you to release the source code of your application if you choose to use and distribute the GPL licensed open source software with your application. In other words, your application must also be licensed under the GPL. PyQt is GPL or paid, and made by Riverbank Software, a 3rd party software vendor. Qt for Python/PySide 2 is LGPL and made by The Qt Company itself, so one would hope it would be well-supported.
Yeah, adding the parentheses around a single variable or value does nothing. The parser essentially ignores it - there’s no difference in the bytecode that’s generated (in CPython at least).
I don't know if you misunderstood "machine learning" with Neural Network. Neural networks are a subset of what machine learning has to offer. So first, if you are only interested in neural network, I would suggest to start with Keras. Tts github is full of [easy examples](https://github.com/keras-team/keras/tree/master/examples). However if you want to see the bigger picture, you should go to [sklearn cheat-sheet](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/machine_learning_map/index.html). Normally each algorithm has its own small tutorial. Good luck with machine learning, it might be frustrating as you often think that you "understand how it works" but reality is different.

Shall I make a list: - No control over concurrency, no access to native threads or subprocesses. - GUIs look like sh*t. No dynamic layout. - No way to customise the widgets NI gives you - So Damn Tedious to wire anything complex - Gives true meaning to the phrase "spaghetti code" - No sane object orientation - Maths/array operations are a nightmare - Expensive - You need to pay even more to distribute your app - You needs to pay yet more for "specialised" functionality (like talking to a database) - Text processing or manipulation is No Fun At All - No way to use (proper) version control. Good luck merging changes in labview code. There's probably more but the little time a spend dealing with labview code is already too much. Whoever thought graphical programming was a good idea really needs to be given a good beating. It's a triumph of marketing over functionality. The *only* reason for LabViews success if that it lets a beginner or manager drop a graph and a few widgets and a hardware device on a GUI in the first 5 minutes of learning. From their on, it's downhill all the way. OK rant over... sorry. I feel better now.
Your comparison with the `requests` code is totally incorrect: &gt; Consider a library like requests that provides a useful API for performing HTTP requests. Every HTTP method has it's own function which is a thin wrapper around requests.Session.request. The code is a little more than 150 lines, with about 90% of that being boilerplate. Using forge we can get that back down to about 10% it's current size, while increasing the literacy of the code. The requests implementation is 29 LOC and ~120 lines of documentation. Your example implementation takes 19 LOC (~65% that of requests, not 10%). Sure it's less code, but you're really not doing yourself any favors by making such wildly untrue claims. Surely there are some more well-founded examples you can provide.
A bit old in the tooth but [Python Is Not Java](http://dirtsimple.org/2004/12/python-is-not-java.html) and [Java is not Python, either...](http://dirtsimple.org/2004/12/java-is-not-python-either.html) are still valid.

Yes, actually. While I wouldn't suggest anyone that has zero coding experience to try to program a game from scratch, Python is used for a wide number of visual novels, both professional and indie.

I was in your shoes about 10 years ago, and one day I just couldn't stand Labview anymore, so I looked for alternatives. I ended up creating my own c++ libraries and gui for each instrument in my lab, using Qt. It was a solid solution, but I realized it would be easier if other people could make small changes to the programs depending on what they needed, without having to worry about compiling and etc, plus few people who are not professional programmers tend to venture on c++. So python ended up being the natural choice, and since I already had a lot of experience with Qt, I used PyQt to create the graphical interfaces. I think it does the job really well, it's easy to learn and create any gui you want! And there's Qt Designer, which you can use to graphically create your interface, using a WYSIWYG editor! So yeah, bottom line is, I recommend PyQt!

&gt; Is it a good idea to make ... in Python? For learning purposes? It's always a yes.
You could just use a column for xml/json 
Sounds like a great use case for sqlite 
Codenvy.io gives you 3gb of ram shared between all of your VM and a nice IDE to code python projects for free. The big limitation tho is that you can't have an inactive VM more than 10 minutes.
Second this. I would be nervous about starting a code base on 2.7. However pyqtgraph claims to support it on their website. I have had decent luck making GUIs for my data acquisition setup of combining two streaming serial interfaces and user input data. 
I also would recommend wxPython. The new Qt for Python project also looks promising.
I think I saw this previously... the 14 lines of code are "loop to spawn bricks, loop to spawn chain links, and then engage tens of thousands of lines of physics simulation C code".
Which version of Labview do/did you run? I'll also just say.. you'll hear software engineers talk about standardized code and how it reduces inefficiency and improve maintainability, but when it comes to Labview, where mostly nobody follow the style guide(s), it's Labview's problem. If you have engineers who treat Labview with care, you won't have spaghetti code. (Which is to say.. like any programming language.)
I saved this code to my computer and managed to get it down from 14 lines of code to just 1 shell command.

I second this. The Channel's tutorial is even about making a Web chat application. 
I don't get this argument. Programming is all about abstraction. Would you still consider an [IOCCC](https://www.ioccc.org/) entry valid if it relied on calling OpenGL? What about operating system calls? Do you include the thousands of lines of C code of whatever kernel that invokes when you run your program? If there exists an abstraction layer, and only a short program is required to interact with that abstraction layer, the program length claim seems valid to me.
While Twine's ability to track state is somewhat… awkwardly implemented, it tracks state and makes it easy to alter an individual scene's representation based on state. That gives it a slight advantage over just basic web development. That said, it's still not great.
&gt;So a little of background, I'm a mechanical engineer that doesn't a lot of testing and hates NI/Labview. We're like the same person.
From someone who's getting a LabVIEW certification this month, you're pretty much spot on. If I want to do anything complicated, I just make a websocket client/server connection and make a Python do all the actual thinking. I will be very happy when LabVIEW dies, and the large company I work for is forced to use something good.
To be clear, this doesn't mean they'll stop working, just that they'll stop getting new releases. In many applications it may be fine to keep running with old versions for years. Python 3 is absolutely the right choice for a new project today, and I would be wary of vendors that tie you to Python 2. But people who have systems running Python 2 don't need to panic.

Plotly is pretty much all plotting unless there are some parts of that library I’m unaware of. Dash is **not** just plotting though! I’ve built web interfaces with it that have drop downs, checkboxes, autocomplete components, and pretty much all other UI components we want. It’s especially powerful if you are able to find libraries of more components beyond the dash-core-components library or build your own components.
The code: import bpy bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_plane_add(radius=100, location=(0, 0, 0)) # create Plane bpy.ops.rigidbody.object_add() bpy.context.object.rigid_body.type = 'PASSIVE' for x in range(1,19): # create Toruses bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_torus_add(location=(0, x*4.3, 110), rotation=(0,1.5708*(x%2), 0), major_radius=3.5, minor_radius=.5, abso_major_rad=1.25, abso_minor_rad=0.75) bpy.ops.rigidbody.object_add() bpy.context.object.rigid_body.collision_shape = 'MESH' if x==1: bpy.context.object.rigid_body.enabled = False for z in range (0,9): # create Cubes bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add(radius=3, location=(x*6-60,2,2.8+z*6)) bpy.ops.rigidbody.object_add() bpy.context.object.rigid_body.mass = 0.0001

There's a lot more to machine learning than just neural networks, fyi, which is what I assume you're referring to with &gt; I understand how the network works...
You misunderstood NN for Machine Learning, NN is a model to solve some machine learning problems. Check this book is a good introduction: Hands\-On Machine Learning with Scikit\-Learn and TensorFlow Then you can look the subreddits: r/MachineLearning, r/tensorflow, r/artificial

Something like redis might work
Q: Any guidance on where I should begin? This is the wrong place to ask, there's a /r/learnpython subreddit to ask questions like this.
You can already do that with PyQt.
Maybe put a \_\_init\_\_.py file in ./app\_config/ as well.
What graphics tool is being used here? 
This. As a LabVIEW programmer for the past 13 years, so much this. There are some nice things about LV that are hard to accomplish in other languages, but overall the UI is looking very dated and does not look like it will ever scale well to the next gen of resolutions. LabVIEW NXG is suppose to fix that, but is a completely new code base. I’m probably not going to migrate towards NXG. 
Also, a mechanical engineer just started learning python in Jan for a new job. I was doing some data analysis and had never written a GUI app before. I used pyqt and pyqtdesigner. Layouts in pyqtdesigner are straightforward and I had something decent (while learning) in less than a week. 
Maybe I'm the odd one out but I used Tkinter for my Python data acquisition GUI. I work in an experimental physics lab at a university and we have a handful of instruments and a handful of different acquisition routines to run. Basically my interface is a GUI scheduling interface along with stdout, stderr output and a CLI-type input for interrupting a routine early (e.g. if you mess it up). Maybe it's not what you're looking for but you can check out my (admittedly messy) code on my GitHub: www.github.com/valdezt/FOSOFtware
Thank you good sir, I am going to look into this, I've just built apps using bottle and bootstrap for UI with jQuery for interactions. This seems much easier than to try to package a server, templates, main app, business logic and database into one executable. 
In java is very common make setters and getters for all the atributes in a class. In Python we don't do this, we use the attribute decorator when need add some validation and stuff.
Thanks for the fix :)

Dash has other UI elements as well, e.g., buttons, checkboxes, etc., that make it nice for creating web apps.
I think it must have been, because with some time and fiddling on their newest one I got in installed. Thanks. 
&gt; Plotly is pretty much all plotting unless there are some parts of that library I’m unaware of. Yeah, it is just for plotting/graphing. But the output it provides is pretty interactive. Also if you create your plots using something like ipython then you can just share your notebook and other people can just run the stored procedures and get a nice interactive output of all the data. But even if you just used plotly to generate static pages with `offline.plot` you could create an `index.html` page that just links to those and just like that you have a nice and simple GUI. I used it recently to do a convex hull problem. Here's the codepen: https://codepen.io/Stack_of_Pancakes/full/vrJWgO I don't know why it's squished on codepen. I used `offline.plot` and fills my whole browser. But it's a fairly interactive chart.
PEPS are "Python Enhancement Proposals". Similar to the Internet engineering community's "Request for Comments" documents, they serve both as a medium for proposing changes to the language and standard library *and* as the "official" specification if the proposed change is adopted.
Thanks 
Published a quick guide about [deleting a file or folder using Python](https://datatofish.com/delete-file-folder-python/)
I wrote one in PyQt a while back that may have some useful code to copy, but it's pretty specialized to what I was doing: https://github.com/petebachant/turbinedaq These days, NI has their own Python package, so I'd switch to that, and honestly, I would probably build as a web app using Dash or widgets in a Jupyter Notebook. The plotting libraries I was using (PyQwt and wrappers for it) seem to have been abandoned.
I'm a little late to the party here but this is something right up my alley. My company actually builds chemical analysis instruments and the software the runs them is entirely python. We interface with pci digitizers, ethernet devices, and a whole slew of serial/USB devices on a single instrument and python handles it beautifully. We do everything with PyQt. We used Qt because the number of resources available for displaying data/interacting with data is immense. Specifically pyqtgraph package deals with very large/complex datasets without a hiccup and seamlessly integrates right into Qt. The others just don't have the depth of resources or the depth of other people that are really skilled that we can turn to if we get stuck. Web based GUI's are also an option but now you are mixing python, javascript, and html so the skills needed to get something out grows fast. One of the things that Qt lets you easily do, and is very important in data acquisition, is threading the GUI separate from the data acquisition. People tend to forget that sending instruments don't always respond in microseconds when you send them queries or their is a data stream not a one shot one answer. Here Qt lets you set up a worker object that can run in a separate thread, control its own queue of tasks and remit them to the GUI all while remaining responsive. And the code to do that is boiler plate. Now throw in pyvisa/pyserial, pyqtgraph or matplotlib and numpy and you can have a full acquisition instrument up and running with almost nothing else. 
No, you're not speaking to the Supreme Court, and you never will. 
And to complement this answer, while most of the PEPs are about specific features (e.g. generators, or new modules, or python 3) or irrelevant to the average pythonista (PEP10 "voting guidelines") some are more foundational, one of these being [PEP8 "Style Guide for Python Code"](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) which I expect is what OP refers to by "mentioned in the web to solve doubts and use it as a guideline", the other major candidate is [PEP20 The Zen of Python](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/) but that one is rarely referred to by PEP number.
I would recommend starting with an introductory book. E.g., Python Machine Learning or Deep Learning with Python (depending if your focus is more on general machine learning with some deep learning or only deep learning). Regarding articles and videos, I heard the free videos by a company called "fastai" are quite good.
Jesus. Just use [vPython](http://www.glowscript.org/#/user/GlowScriptDemos/folder/Examples/program/Bounce-VPython/edit) ``` ball = sphere (color = color.green, radius = 0.4, make_trail=True, retain=200) ball.mass = 1.0 ball.p = vector (-0.15, -0.23, +0.27) side = side - thk*0.5 - ball.radius dt = 0.3 while True: rate(200) ball.pos = ball.pos + (ball.p/ball.mass)*dt ```
Nowhere in this code you have defined a variable named bar. Maybe what you want to call 'foo.call\_test()'.
Maybe you meant foo.call_test() bar is not a variable in your script. Expectations are you cannot call a function on it. If you were to call the function after "foo = 'bar'" it would give you and error saying function not defined. Once you make foo a class with that function, you can call it on that object.
I guess I am not being clear. I am trying to make an object that is called the value stored in the variable "foo", which in this case is "bar". How do I do that?

On the Flask side of things i recommend Miguel Grimberg [blog post](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/easy-websockets-with-flask-and-gevent) and his [socketio library](https://github.com/miguelgrinberg/python-socketio/).
&gt; Faraday Never heard about `Faraday`. Is this the one you are talking about: https://github.com/infobyte/faraday You forgot emacs, geany, micro, Brackets, Xcode, MacVIM, TextMate, Oni, Spyder, Gedit, a8, alphatk, Code:Blocks, Cream, Bluefish, DreamPie, My fingers need some rest.. so I will just put this link here for now: https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonEditors :)
Look into `str.split()`. Also, /r/learnpython.
agree 200% with this.. the beauty of VIM is that is highly malleable.. It did take me a while to get started.. and get used to its way of doing things.. now my friends want to copy me all the time.. :)
What? This is great!
As far as i know its a bad idea, but if you really want it check this links: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1373164/how-do-i-create-a-variable-number-of-variables https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11553721/using-a-string-variable-as-a-variable-name
What I was thinking of is something similar to Zork, maybe with some music and images thrown in every now and then. In my opinion there's too much going on in visual novels, so I don't really enjoy them.
Thanks, I actually just found a bunch of references to this, after banging my head against it all day yesterday. Thanks!
thanks! it worked :)
I'm new to Reddit and didn't know that the sidebar dropped down, sorry.
variable_name ClassName CONSTANT Research "dunder" methods: __init__, __enter__, __iter__, etc. {'dictionaries': {'are': ['life', 'awesome', 'necessary']}} Finally, resist the urge to use too many modules. A &gt; B &gt; C &gt; D &gt; run.py is unacceptable in most cases. Keep your imports short! "import project; project.run()" is better than "from project.src.lib.run import ProjectRunner; ProjectRunner().execute()" or some suitably absurd import. 
I mainly know about VIM.. So can you tell me what plugins you have in JetBrains? I will provide you the names of 3 different alternatives for the same in VIM.. :) Or a couple of ways to use an external library with some `VimL/Python`. As @turtle mentioned.. the beauty of Sublime/VIM/Emacs is that you can stay in the same editor and call external libraries or plugins. In academic settings perhaps you can just use 1 language, and just do some matlab coding.. but in industrial settings, complex networked systems, you will probably be dealing with multiple systems all with their own way of talking to each other. In these settings, you either have to have multiple different editors/IDEs to handle each different language.. or go to something else like VIM/Sublime/Emacs which essentially delegates the task of handling different languages to plugins/libraries (using the Unix philosophy).
Didn't know Sublime was still going strong.. One of my friends actually converted from Sublime to VIM, full-time..when he saw what was possible in VIM/NeoVIM.. Agree 100%.. thats what I have been doing.. And if you have been even coding for a little while.. finding external plugins, configuring them and sometimes debugging them should be very easy.. Forgot to mention a couple more..https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonEditors.. 
This is a **very** bad idea but it works, foo += " = ClassyClass()" exec(foo)
There are performance and security benefits to keeping the Python interpreter in a separate process from the plain web-server logic. Nginx in reverse-proxy configuration can serve static files and reject malformed requests more efficiently than it could if you had a WSGI-compliant Python environment in-process, and the application server (Gunicorn or UWSGI) can be simpler because it can assume that the reverse proxy has already taken care of those requests that your Python code doesn't need to see.
Sorry they provided several bit of example code as well as bunch of classes and functions written in 2.7. The better answers is the company/vendor only supports 2.7. Anything I wanted to do in 3 I would have to start from scratch. Which might not be that bad as it would just be translate what they've already written in 2 to 3.
Well, it depends on your preferred mode of input. If you want to make a choose-your-own-adventure, renpy is okay. You can easily forego VN aesthetics or interface conventions by using `nvl-mode`. If you want parser-style input, some `go east`, `take lamp` kind of thing, though, it's pretty much worthless. Try Inform7 or one of the other parser engines. You probably shouldn't try to roll your own engine, though. These things are surprisingly complicated and days you spend to make saving work don't really pay off (speaking from the experience here). Google engines, not languages, because someone has already put a lot of time and skill into solving technical problens for you.
Again, are you using the same python process or are you using sockets? From my experience with 20000 Hz data, the data acquisition part is likely not written in python. They could provide sample interfaces in python 2/3 or C++ or java, but their product is a piece of hardware running a very low footprint code written in C. I strongly suggest you port the sample code, which was probably written 8 years ago. I'm sure the examples are tiny. Python 2 is dead.
&gt; No control over concurrency I'm going to disagree here. It has great control over concurrency in that its dataflow and things are inherently parallelized based on the flow of data. It would be very hard to do some of the parallelization in other languages that you get for free in labview. For example, this is why labview code can be compiled directly to FPGAs.
Thanks for all the feedback everyone. PyQt seems to be highly recommended. Is PyQt a stand-alone package or do I need to buy Qt and then use PyQt to interact with it?
When I tried pyqtdeploy there was pretty much no indication as to why nothing would build. 
Call me a young'n but I like GUIs in my IDEs :)
Most of the time is being spent writing requirements and planning the next phase of some projects. I have never written requirements because all of this has been for me and me only. Finished debugging a VM issue and also finished creating a simiple CI pipeline that periodically runs my tests on a Windows computer. Next I have to transfer this to my Windows VM and make sure that it runs periodically. Hopefully, I will have the requirements written up, and then write up the logic and the high level interfaces for the next phase of the project.
I gotcha. The answer is I don’t know. I just ordered the hardware and am trying to get this half figured out before it arrives. From my understanding the hardware has it own CPU on board and is sending the data to the host laptop or could be configured to store it locally on an SD card. I might be fully understanding your question either. This is my first real endeavor in python, and any real coding for that matter. 
Well – I don't think that comparison is totally incorrect. You're looking at boilerplate. That's a big part of what ``forge`` solves. But that's only half of it. Even after 150 lines, you still don't know what you're getting with the `requests` functions. This isn't a complaint against the KR, it's a fundamental [problem with the language](https://github.com/python/typing/issues/270). I think a saner future is one where ``kwargs`` isn't used as a crutch but a lever: i.e. not for use when a developer is too lazy to write out all the accepted parameters, but instead when a function truly accepts any keyword argument (like `str.format`). And of course, I don't say "lazy developer" with any grievance. Making parameters explicit costs maintenance time, and requires a ton of compatibility tests. Today's alternative just doesn't work.
That just went over your head. I know I'm not. 
Sure.. I will give it a look in the next few days.. 
i know sql is known as heavy but i think that is past with sqlite3 included with python. An sqlite db is just a textfile... you don't need an external server running.
Can you explain what you mean by data lineage? Sounds interesting.. and seems like something we have been doing too long.. I pretty much automated some of this using `xlwings`.. but perhaps there is a better way..
to answer your question about whether its possible to automate/refresh the SQL data source.. the simplest of these would be to use something like `time.sleep(180); refresh_data()`. where `refresh_data()` refreshes the data.
At work I see a lot of Python written by Java devs, in no particular order that's what makes me cry: \- 3 nested for loops instead of a good list/dict comprehension \- CamelCase variable names, lowercase "constants" (why???) \- index access to a list/tuple instead of looping over it \- absolute lack of try/except \- loops used instead of builtin's filter, reduce and map \- 1k different reimplementations of [some functool](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html) \- 1000k different reimplementations of [some itertool](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/itertools.html) Have a look at the functools and itertools modules, study the [builtin functions](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/functions.html) and use them everytime you can. Some gotchas: \- Pay attention to the [pass\-by\-reference/pass\-by\-value](https://jeffknupp.com/blog/2012/11/13/is-python-callbyvalue-or-callbyreference-neither/) difference \- Study the [mutable/immutable](https://medium.com/@meghamohan/mutable-and-immutable-side-of-python-c2145cf72747) difference \- ..and [how this may be different](https://medium.com/@tyastropheus/tricky-python-i-memory-management-for-mutable-immutable-objects-21507d1e5b95) to how you are used in Java
Can you show how to plot the seams as well on the image ?
You should look into Prof. Andrew Ng's course on Machine Learning on Coursera. Its pretty much the best introductory course in machine learning. 
Thank for your answer. How does the application server integrate itself with the reverse proxy? How does it achieve not to be "in-process" and why would the framework be?
The MIT edx course on Python is pretty good actually: https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-mitx-6-00-1x-11
Personal Opinion, The issue with UI Automation is it's ideal only for Testing. As you said, they are legacy apps, there may be certain quirks that you didn't account for during automating it. What happens when the focus shifts because a popup window for Windows Update shows up? Can your automation recover from that scenario? What if it entered the wrong numbers in the wrong columns? Will the output be validated? Will someone even know? Maybe you put in sleep calls? Will the same program run differently on a slower computer? how about a faster computer?
&gt; How does the application server integrate itself with the reverse proxy? The reverse proxy passes requests to the application and receives responses over a standard socket. This can be a firewalled network connection if you're running the reverse proxy and the application server on different machines, or a local Unix-domain socket if both are running on the same machine. &gt; How does it achieve not to be "in-process" and why would the framework be? The framework is just a Python library that defines a callable for the WSGI server to call with requests. It doesn't define how to get a Python interpreter running and import that library into it. The application server defines that. The two application servers that I know off the top of my head work a little differently. Gunicorn is itself written in Python, so your framework and your code run under whatever interpreter you used to run Gunicorn. UWSGI is written in a compiled language and uses the functions in `libpython.so` to create an embedded Python interpreter. Either way, the Python interpreter and the app server's own logic are running in the same operating-system process, so a bug in one has access to memory normally used by the other. That's what I mean by "in-process".
Pretty sure pandas `join()` does this.
The constant maintenance that you will have to perform to address everyone of the edge cases that causes the script to fail will be endless and orders of magnitude more expensive than just adding the ability to use it from the command line or as a linkable library. Ask anyone who did screen scraping in the 80's/90's why that never worked for more than a few days/weeks at a time without constant fixes because of data corruption, you will have the same problems X 1000.
Thank you so much. Very good idea. :)
Wonder if you were assuming that the `GUI-app` and `GUI-automation` tool would run on the users desktop.. I know that is a very hard thing to do.. I didn't mean to do that at all. Sorry.. I should have clarified.. I didn't mean that the `GUI-app` and the `GUI-automation` layer would actualy run on the Users desktop. The `GUI-app` and `GUI-automation` layer would run in a very controlled environment in a server Users would only be able to access it through very controlled API-s, from existing UI-apps such as `Excel` or write their own `python` code to run the remote `GUI-app` and the `GUI-automation` tool..
Thanks for replying.. Actually `from the command line or as a linkable library`.. this is something similar I had in mind. I didn't mean that the `GUI-app` and the `GUI-automation` tool would actually run on the users desktop.. What I was thinking of was really that the `GUI-app` and `GUI-automation` layer would reside in a very controlled environment in a server, with everything turned off except for the app. Users would be able to access it using a server-client API from python or command line. Or if they had to interactively interact with the GUI app they could always run in on their desktop (which would be separate from the GUI-app running on the server). Can you explain what you mean by a `linkable library`?
&gt;boingboing.net For a moment there I thought you created an entire website to host this tutorial
Understood. Make sure you address the following questions first: * How much time do you want to invest in the "very controlled API"? is it easier just to rewrite the legacy app? * How will you monitor it? How long will it take for an engineer to take notice if something goes wrong? What happens when the server crashes mid-way? Can it recover gracefully? *I'm not picking sides, just trying to be an adversary for your idea.*
Actually, I appreciate you being adversarial to the idea :) I was just adding some details I forgot to add.. That's the kind of feedback I was looking for.. Those are very good questions.. I have to think about that, perhaps talk to some other engineers. Thanks for the feedback again..
I put together this concise summary, showing you how to protect your Django apps from Cross Scripting Attacks, the most frequent vulnerability of web applications! I hope it helps, feedback is very appreciated.
Thanks!
Still do not get it. How to aggregate by column? AAA and AAA1 are completely different, and we need to add their corresponding numbers and assign to AAA. Can you give some sample code? 
Ah, I get it now, thank you very much! I thought that the reverse-proxy/plain web server was WSGI compliant but apparently that's not the case and the only thing it does is forwarding the requests (after filtering the correct ones, etc) to the application server at the network level. The application server is the actual server that complies with the server-side of the WSGI standard. The trouble I had with understanding this model is that from what I read, historically people were using CGI scripts or plain servers modules (e.g. mod_python) to call Python code from a plain server. WSGI is presented as a standard to formalize that, and I thought it was still to be understood as in a plain server - application communication. But apparently it triggered the development of application servers that are full featured servers dedicated to serve Python applications, relegating the plain web servers as just reverse proxy.
"Most starred on GitHub" Is that the barometer for software nowadays?
Appart from the style and language features differences I python code feels different. You can write pythonic code in Java and write javaesc code in python, but it will look weird to other devs, and will probably be at leas inefficient and at worst lead.to dead ends in your design. One example: Python classtrees are for example a lot shallower. Instead of many interfaces and subclasses dynamic features are used. Another: The JRE brings a lot of features, but most of the build in libraries are 2nd rate at best and use design that was prevalent 10 years ago, but should be discouraged now. This is not true in the python standard library.
My experience with GUI apps has been pretty bad.. In our company, this has led to the expectation that everything should be possible to do by just click and point..as a result we have a bunch of GUI apps which dont scale.. Python is a very easy language to learn.. probably just as easy to use as a GUI app.. Wondering if your colleagues are open to just learning a bit of python coding? Perhaps you can create the main library and they can modify or call that library to do what they need to do using scripts...
Looking to finish the updated flask tutorial from [Miguel Grinberg](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world)
PyQt is a standalone package that comes with Qt, you can install via ``` pip install PyQt5 ``` Here is my first project with PyQt5 (I used it to show matplotlib plots) https://github.com/j9ac9k/dual-axis-post-processor Here is a collection of small PyQt apps which is super helpful for quick references: https://github.com/mfitzp/15-minute-apps Here is a larger library I wrote that makes use of pyqtgraph (it takes primary .wav files and allows you to view the signal information in a variety of ways) https://github.com/j9ac9k/timeview Most code samples/documentation you will see for PyQt will actually be for Qt5 (in C++) but don't let that discourage you, the API is very very similar, just read through the example in C++ and you can probably map out to PyQt without too much effort. EDIT: Since you're coming with no experience; you may want to take a look at Sentdex's youtube playlist for PyQt here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBME1ZyHiP8&amp;vl=en
Are you me? ....Started writing software to assist with analysis of test data, ..test scripts got more and more complex, next thing I knew I was write applications using OpenCV to identify defects from high resolution camera images. Couple of years later, I wish I could do ME analysis work periodically, but am otherwise having a much more fulfilling career.
Thanks, I went ahead and figured out how to use dictionaries.
I'm a database guy and I would almost be inclined to import this data into a SQLITE . I assume what you mean by example AAA date1 num1+num4 it would be : AAA 4/5/2018 5+9 Which would be: AAA 4/5/2018 14 
On the same date, add number same row as AAA and number same row as AAA1, and assign to AAA. AAA1 is translation of AAA from another language, and the strings of the two items are completely different. Based on what ThePidesOfMarch said, I am thinking the method "reorder_categories" in python pandas. 
Easy in DB. Table MyImported: MyString, MyDate, MyNum select substr(Mystring, 3) as Mystrings, MyDates, Sum(MyNum) as MyNums from MyImported Group by Mystrings, MyDates 
Road\-block avoi\-dance.
There was a thread either here or /r/learnpython about good open source libraries to look at; ill see if I can find it again.
But AAA and AAA1 are completely different. AAA can be " some guy", AAA1 will be "一个人“。 
Not sure how you can group those two when you are trying to compare apples to oranges. Are are you linking those two are the same 'group?' 
Going crazy trying to implement 2D and 3D simulation in my pde solver. Improvement are slow but in a regular basis.
I am thinking reorder the column 1 in file 2 based on the order of column 1 in file 1 using "reorder_categories" in python pandas. There is sample code online. Try to figure out. 
Dicts are definitely the way to go when you want to pair "names" with values.
how I wish I can afford that $10, just a student. 
Sqlite is surprisingly performant for use-cases like yours. There are some lightweight ORMs out there that could further reduce the code you have to write, e.g. [peewee](https://github.com/coleifer/peewee/blob/master/README.rst).
You maybe already have checked this, but are you certain that the file exists, and that your working directory is correct?
Using regex to process JSON strings is a serious code smell, i.e. not necessarily a bug, but a place where bugs come from. I would avoid it at all costs if possible. Usually when people are having problems with JSON, they are really having problems with nested data. I would go in that direction if I were you.
I think the OS can be decoupled from the argument, ie the OS is common to /everything/ so there's no reason to consider the LOC there. However, if you don't have the C physics library, you aren't really calculating any of those physics in 14 LOC, it would take quite a lot more to achieve the result. This is true if your OS is 1 million LOC or 14 LOC. Consider that I wrote a function that is 100 LOC. If that was in some library, by your argument you'd ignore it. But you'd count the function in my total LOC if it was part of a singular script, even though I re-use the function. Either way it still has to exist, and be ran, to get my result. This is true if I somehow got the program to run on bare metal with no OS.
Thanks for your help so far. Basically, it pulls in data through an API, sorts through some of the data, and runs a pretty simple algorithm. I timed it using import time start_time = time.time() main() print("--- %s seconds ---" % (time.time() - start_time)) The total time for everything is .2097 seconds. The initial import of data through the API takes .2081 seconds and everything else takes .0016 seconds. And it runs this calculation approximately every second. This is running on my MacBook Pro (2017 3.5GHz i7, 16GB 2133 MHz, with an SSD, over WiFi). I totally understand that the the API request time is going to be the biggest issue and I've seen it swing by 50% in both directions easily, but I don't want anything on my end slowing it down further.
could you maybe use pandas and pct_change? http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.pct_change.html
Ok
There's the `flask-login` plugin's [`@login_required`](http://flask-login.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#flask_login.login_required) decorator where by default unauthorized users will get redirected to the login view. It basically does that `is_login_valid()` check for you, if all you're interested in is cleaning up the top of your routing functions. 
Sounds like a good use of [`collections.defaultdict`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.defaultdict).
If you need to build it as a stand alone app, go for tkinter, there are even IDEs capables to interactively edit tkinter GUI design. ... but if you are building an in-house solution and plan to mantain it periodically also make it available to teams etc, I suggest you to consider build it as a jupyter notebook and run in a Docker container at your's office NAS/server or in a networked workstation.
You don't just import boubcing_ball as bb 
Haha
Not sure who told you C died in the 90s. It is still the foundation of all those new kids on the block. So some inherited behaviors is to be expected Short answer is when you try to evaluate none as a true or false you get false. X or y statements translate to If x return true else if y return true else return false For a more detailed answer https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3914667/false-or-none-vs-none-or-false 
Here's an [article](http://pbpython.com/python-word-template.html) I wrote on one possible approach. Hope it helps.
Also: `print(not None)` What is going on\^\^
Did you look at this? http://pbpython.com/python-word-template.html
That's awesome! This is better than my first serious python program, keep up the good work :)
Nice idea, is it in Github? Or somewhere?
Python is working with the concept that the objects are truthy or falsy, even if not explicitly the True or False object. None is naturally Falsy - or to reverse things, `and` returns True only if both sides are truthy, and whatever you think of None it's definitely not that. The actual return value is not just True or False, but something like the last evaluated argument. So, `False and None` returns False because this is the first argument (and caused the `and` statement to halt). `None and False` returns `None` for the same reson. The examples using `or` work the same, except you get the second argument back. This is occasionally convenient, although I'm not a huge fan of using this obscure syntax.
The concept of truthiness is fundamentally different from C's bools as numbers concept. Also it's not only Python, but also Javascript. Like with everything, if you don't like it, don't use it. Also all of that is commutative, as all values returned are falsy. 
i need to refactor a bit before putting on GitHub, my user account details and API secret key in the source (I got lazy about that since the script is just running from my local machine), but I plan on putting it there. 
&gt; X or y statements translate to &gt; &gt;If x return x else if y return y else return y ftfy
It's definitely possible in more than one way I suppose. I would want to convert it to a 2-dimensional ndarry, sorted by date, then do (2darray\[1:\] - 2darray\[:-1\])/2darray\[:-1\].
Thanks. I have often wondered about this issue and your simple explanation makes perfect sense.
Google style guide isn't going to do much more than PEP8, and PEP8 is much more faithful to the general idea of what Pythonic code is. 
Actually, the Word XML format is an ECMA standard. I don’t recommend reading the standard as it is quite large but there are libraries for generating Word documents from nothing such as [python-docx](https://python-docx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
Very nice project! What is the specific problem about the mismatch name songs. Can you give an example?
If you happen to find good boilerplate code in C# land, you could leverage [comtypes.automation](https://github.com/enthought/comtypes/blob/master/comtypes/automation.py) and [ctypes](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html) packages to interact with a DLL file built from the C# code that only has the added work of a simple decorator. Example: `...` `using RGiesecke.DllExport;` `namespace SomeClass` `{` `public class SomeClass` `{` `[DllExport("do_something", CallingConvention = CallingConvention.Cdecl)]` `public static void DoSomething(ref object passedVar)` `{` `// do stuff to passedVar` `...` `}` `}` `}` then use 'SomeClass.dll' within Python code: `...` `from ctypes import cdll, POINTER` `from comtypes.automation import VARIANT` `def main(*args, **kwargs):` `SomeClasslib = cdll.LoadLibrary(R'C:\path\to\.dll\file')` `some_variable = VARIANT()` `// some_variable can be more treated as more than just an int` `// I've used this effectively as a string[] for example` `SomeClasslib.do_something.argtypes = [POINTER(VARIANT)]` `SomeClasslib.do_something(some_variable)` `...` Hope this helps!
r/learnpython??
Great! Did a similar thing but used my old mp3 archive and turen it into Spotify playlist. I used fuzzy wuzzy search to do the album match as the spelling/orders was a bit off. Maybe that could work for you as well with the song names?
Ex: on BestEverAlbums, the song title is "Shine On You Crazy Diamond**, Parts I-V**' When running that string in Spotify's search API, no result is returned, because in Spotify, the song is "Shine On You Crazy Diamond **(Pts. 1-5)**" Not sure yet how I'm going to get around that. I'm assuming the other songs that do not get added are due to the same issue. 
That's awesome! 
Maybe my approach is bit "brute force algorithm" one but you could probably delete one sentence from the end until it finds a song, then check if it's from the artist. If it doesn't match the artist or doesn't find a song then you cannot add it.
That's a good approach, but even then, in the specific case of Shine On You Crazy Diamond, it's not going to know which "Parts" of the song to use using that method (I'm assuming) 
That's true. I mean, it's a really specific case. But I'll try to think of another solution.
For your issue with the names, maybe a regex expression will help? You could add clauses for edge cases where names may be slightly off and allow close results to be accepted.
ROW OF HOUSES!
You could experiment with "string distance" to avoid the not-perfect-match problem. https://pypi.org/project/StringDist/ 
Great ideia! Maybe use [fuzzy string matching](http://chairnerd.seatgeek.com/fuzzywuzzy-fuzzy-string-matching-in-python/) while searching for the song. You could keep a history of songs added in case you can't find one on spotify, and you add the top 1 one from the older list, or you could crawl to the next top 10 songs and add one of them
Spyder no longer has the 'Configure' option. It now has 'Configuration Per File' option. And you can only enter command line arguments if you choose to execute in an external system terminal. And this closes immediately upon the end of the script, even if you have "Interact with the Python console after execution" box ticked or not. Any help appreciated.
Another vote for this, which is a vote for [docx-mailmerge](https://github.com/Bouke/docx-mailmerge). I used this to generate 1,000s of documents for students to sign from a spreadsheet. `document.merge_rows` is the killer feature IMO.
While working on a project to download MP3s to play on my car's old dashboard, the solution I found to matching names was running a search on [Genius](http://genius.com/) using any wrapper for their API, and getting the first result as the real song name and singer name. It's kinda hacky, but it worked really well for the songs that genius had on it's database. Nice work!
Inspiring! Good use of Python, sir!
I put the date aside first, only concentrate on one date of data, and put file1 into a dictionary. got the following code. works. But still looking for a better, more concise code. for i in range(len(b)): for k in range(len(b)): for key in a.keys(): if b[i][0]==key and b[k][0]==a[key]: print b[i][2]+b[k][2], b[i][0],b[k][0] 
 What I did find was that if you run from withing Spyder, the command that Spyder runs is something like: runfile('c:\\somepath\\[somescript.py](https://somescript.py)', "wkdir" = 'c:\\somepath\\') I guessed that you could do this: runfile('c:\\somepath\\[somescript.py](https://somescript.py)', "wkdir" = 'c:\\somepath\\', "args" = 'the command line args') And it worked.
Print(“hello world!”)
I personally haven't looked into/used the module, but from the error message you reported I would assume you didn't instantiate a new Turtle instance to call .listen() or .onkey(). Instead, it sounds like you called Turtle.listen().
Is RTF sufficient for your needs? That's really a much simpler format to generate.
I did import turtle at the start
Excellent if you only started learning last week! Many people I’ve worked with struggle with researching and doing things like this, but you need a can do attitude to programming, and it sounds like you’ve just followed the instructions and googled the errors with persistence until you got it done. Keep going like this, and you’ll go far in programming
I think it would be easy to make a server sending json back to the users with a call... The functionality is already there in the code so all you have to do is rip it out and connect it with some call. The GUI way might seem like a shortcut but im pretty sure itll end up as a nightmare. The advantage to just making an api is that your dev process will be streamlined too and will automatically support multiple users.
Ty... il try it 
Any experience in programming before Python?
What you're seeing is the short-circuit evaluation of `and` and `or`; it's nothing specific to `None`. Some other examples: print(False and 0) print(0 and False) print(False and []) print([] and False) 
Oh I see what you mean while looking at the docs, I deleted my original comment as it isn't helpful. Would you be comfortable pasting some of your code?
You are correct, I just meant to show what happens with x and y being boolean values but I didn't clarify that. thanks
Just use cron, yagmail and a json file for holding history.
This done within your program, nothing to do with a scheduler: - Sends an email or notification with the data - Does not send data that was scraped in the past This is done using a scheduler: - Runs on a daily basis Yeah, Cron will work fine.
I try to avoid try/except if i can and i started with python. Is that dirty? I feel try/except is ugly.. Am i missing something?
You may or may not be surprised of the frequency at which this question is asked. There's a wealth of information just in a simple search of this subreddit, using a few keywords you've included here (such as object-oriented, `__init__`, `self`, OOP, etc.). Broadening that search to other subreddits (found in this subreddit's sidebar, as well as the sidebar of *those* subreddits' sidebars) will yield even more information to begin your research. Also, you'll likely find the help you're looking for at r/learnpython or r/learnprogramming
In as few words as I can: OOP allows you to have packets of code that share a theme through the object they belong too. The self refers to a specific object. For example if you make a Pizza class you might give it a method of printing how many slices are left: Def count(self): Return self.slices The self means only run it on the object in particular you care about. As in, if you went to a pizza shop and asked your pizza object how many slices are left, you want only the pizza you are talking to to respond, not every pizza Code is code in terms of speed, it’s mostly for organization 
You want r/learnpython
I've done something similar and I've just used cron. 
THIS IS SO AWESOME I ALREADY IMPLEMENTED YOUR SOLUTION THANKS
The author already recommended it and I crushed the project with it. Thanks y'all
What exactly is starring on github? Im out of the loop.
Also take this gold
It's a thing you can click on an individual repository to signify your jovial acceptance of its existence. It's a "like" button for GitHub code repositories.
ah, thanks
Yeah! Primarily PHP/WordPress and front-end JavaScript, wanted to level up my game. 
I'd probably use a dictionary of dictionaries as the resulting data structure, where it would look like MyData['AAA']['some date'] contains the numerical value. The part that confuses me is how you link AAA to AAA1 since AAA1 does not contain AAA. Are these strictly pairs where they're consecutive lines? Or could there be an arbitrary number of translations? It doesn't really matter. I'd build a mapping of items based on file 1 where AAA maps to AAA, AAA1 maps to AAA, AAAX maps to AAA. When processing over each row in file 2, use the mapping to translate it to the original version to use in the dictionary of dictionaries listed at the beginning.
You wrote that article? I used that last month to write a huge time saving script for work. Thanks a ton!
&gt; 84 out of 100 I suggest you publish the remaining 16 songs here, because then anyone who wants to put some time in can accept ... the challenge to write a heuristics for fuzzy matching.
Thanks for the explanation. I'll hold my nose and tolerate the bad smell from logical operators that have rvalues of any damn thing they feel like, rather than a boolean.
print "hello world" I started with python 2 ;)
Post this on GitHub. You'll have people contributing it's an interesting idea. I did some crawling myself recently to get price updates in Australia.

I got them all right
You can always do `print(bool(thing_1 and thing_2))`
Indexing into a container is always `[]`. Building a list with a literal or a comprehension uses `[]`. Building a dict or set with a literal or comprehension uses `{}`.
a container is anything that holds information i'm assuming? that makes sense if so
There is one way, write a function, replace all AAA1, XXX1 with AAA, XXX. then group by. 
self is the instance, a specific version of the pattern defined by the class. It has all the methods (functions of a class) and attributes defined on the class. \_\_init\_\_ initializes an instance. You don't want to call the class and get a half ready object that needs further setup. The init method should prepare the object so that is ready to go when the user gets it. Classes don't make programs faster.
You might be able to go straight to the source of the data rather than going through the button press. The best way to reverse engineer a web page with a button is to click the button in your browser with the developer tools installed and the network tab. Listed there will be the requests, headers and contents that your browser sent and using that info you can recreate those requests in a program. When I clicked the "load more" button, I noticed that a get request was made to this url: [https://heroesofthestorm.com/en-us/leaderboards/hero/8/americas.frag?page=2](https://heroesofthestorm.com/en-us/leaderboards/hero/8/americas.frag?page=2) and when I did a wget of that, the result was full of data that you could parse with bs. You might find that method is easier than using selenium. If you have anyother questions like this, I would recommend /r/learnpython.
Thanks for your comment /u/dudebrolmao300.. &gt;I would start with defining everything the user might ask for, then devising how this looks best in json and go from there. I have something that works for me.. this is what I am doing.. and checking whether there are any holes in my logic or not. When I meant I have a prototype.. I have already built a server-client demo.. I used ssh, mainly because I was more familiar with ssh.. For simple communication between the server and the client, I was pretty much piping `text` over SSH, just like what Tim-Berners Lee did with the first WWW but over RPC. Because this App runs on Windows, there were some additional complexity that I have to go around, by using scheduled tasks.. but at least in tests.. it works very repeatably. `Json` seems like a very obvious better choice than plain text.. because `python` can natively parse `json`, especially if I have to parse more complicated text based files. So far the input to the program `appA` has been a simple `text` file, and a lot of binary files.. but probably will get more complicated if I try to scale to more users. Regarding alternatives, unfortunately, there is no way to get `APIs` for certain apps because its supplied by a vendor.. and there have been some efforts to recreate `appA`, but the vendor has for-sure put in a lot of work in optimizing `appA`, and nobody adopted the new app that was built from scratch to replace `appA`. I open to new ways of communication between the server and client for sure.. so I am wondering, would you mind explaining why `flask` (http-server, I am assuming) is better than using `ssh` (`ssh server`)?
Hah, that's weak. When I finished a week of learning python, I was able to make my computer say hello to the entire world.
First, let me correct myself and use the word collection (although almost all containers are also collections). Some builtin collections are list, tuple, dict, set, and str. They do hold things, but specifically the things they hold are obtained by indexing with `[]`. Other kinds of objects hold things as attributes, which are obtained with `.`. Indexing collections with `[]` is good for arbitrarily many pieces of data, while accessing object attributes with `.` is good for specific pieces of data.
I'll have a look when next I have a chance. I figured sqlite was going to be my option. Thanks
Since I'm not too concerned about the 'cleanliness' of my code, I'll avoid introducing an extra layer. That said, I'll keep those options in mind. Thanks
I've used it. It's limited, but quite easy.
Thank you!
Could also use sequencematcher from the difflib library! I've used this in my own Spotify track related programs. [https://docs.python.org/2/library/difflib.html](https://docs.python.org/2/library/difflib.html)
Glad it helped!
There is no such variable (to my knowledge). The body of the iteration is not a namespace, that could trigger the creation of sth like the hidden variable you're looking for.
I think that this is a bad post. Not in a sense of your game being bad (which it may or may not be, I don't know). In a sense of it being a bad way to get the attention. All you've provided is a link to a 34-commit repo without a particularly interesting README. It's unlikely that someone will spend time on reading your code without any clear reason to do so. Now, if you dropped some screenshots instead, you'd get feedback on graphics and UI. Though that doesn't really belong in /r/python. If you asked some technical question like "How do I build an asynchronous this-or-that" or "How do I integrate gstreamer videos to a Pygame app", you'd get technical answers. If you dropped a build, someone might eventually play it and provide feedback. As it is, I don't expect any comments (beside this one and/or responses to it) to appear here.
There is not a hidden variable. A way to check something like this is to put the 'for' statement and the 'print' statement on different lines, then set a break point on the 'print' line, and run the script through a debugger. When it pauses, you can see the variable names/values available.
why Python over something like C#? 
You could try printing locals() and globals() to see what's there, but I dont think there is anything. 
I've done exactly that before asking the question, but – as you thought – I found nothing.
I didn't try using the debugger. Thanks for your answer.
Lanyard.com used to be good buts it's kind of fallen off in the past few years.
Yes there is! Its abstracted away in python, but it’s definitely there. If you’re using cPython as your interpreter, then that variable is on the c side of things rather than python. 
https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#the-for-statement This explains that an iterator is created from the sequence that is "passed" to the `for` statement. So I don't think there might be any reason to have such variable. The loop already has the iterator object. But I don't really know the answer to your question.
Of course there’s a hidden variable, it’s just in the c side of things, for cPython.
I'm like where do I learn about using API after 2 months
 I would argue the speed of development for a startup trying to get a working prototype in front of customers asap python and Qt really makes that process simple. Its later you pay for it when managing builds. Second its because our other dev(who is part time dev part time company officer)shared python as a common language. Third, speed on the software end is almost never our bottleneck; its all in the hardware times. If we ever do care about speed we can always go back and make it work faster with things like numba or wrapping C. Pyvisa pretty much covers everything else that isn't ctypes wrapped. Finally, when I was going through grad school our groups primary objective was building new instruments. When I came in everyone was on visual basic which drove me up a wall. I tried switching things to Java at the time but that was even worse. I finally ended up with my own project and I started looking at C++, C#, and python (because we were linked to the astronomy community). As a grad student managing a group instrument you don't really get a real development cycle. If your experiment that day calls for X functionality you have to get X functionality built in right then else risk a lot of down time and angry students waiting behind you. We changed how that instrument ran or worked up data on a daily to weekly basis with no unit testing. Stopping to compile for every tiny tweek would have killed us. So python quickly won out. Downside of course is many hardware drivers, if not SCPI server based, were only in C so there was a lot of annoying ctypes wrapping to do. IMHO the only real "downside" is when it comes to packaging. Its a headache to get right the first time, everytime a new version of something comes out we have to retool the compiler, and the raw code isn't really "secure" as it ends up existing as a pile of .pyd's in an extensionless zip file.
I've been doing python and hardware interfacing for 8 years now and there is no such thing as hardware that only supports python From experience there are only a few ways they write their code to work. 1. They are using a SCPI interface over serial. Their example code will be using either pyserial or pyvisa which works exactly the same in both pythons. The only difference in their code is likely going to be print statements. 2. They are doing SCPI connections over Ethernet. Here they could be using pyvisa or their own custom socket class. If its the former you just need to change print statements and add .encode()/.decode() to any strings that are sent over the socket to the instrument in python3. Nothing else chances. 3. They are using ctypes to wrap a *.dll/*.so driver. Only prints change again. Run the link below and that will autoport any example code over to python 3 for you. https://docs.python.org/3.1/library/2to3.html
Awesome
Total guess, but I assume the Spotify API takes a string of the song name, but doesn’t give you much info back? That doesn’t give you two strings to compare. I like that article though. 
This is very cool stuff!
I don't know anything about this PEP in particular, but generally speaking, you can find much of the discussion about PEPs on the mailing lists, like [python-ideas](https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/python-ideas). Here is [a thread from 2015](https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-ideas/2015-September/036535.html) with (significant) discussion about PEP 505, which you can read through; perhaps there are newer threads too, but list archives are annoying to search through, so I haven't looked. (And, of course, you can always reignite discussion if you have new insight to share or think maybe the language situation has changed since 2015.)
Python 2 is very much far from dead. Python 3 may be the now and the future, but it isn't the be all and end all of Python. Python 2 is still the default for a lot of sysadmin tools and you'll find many libraries that still haven't been ported. That said, if starting a new project then do 3, and porting from 2 to 3 usually isn't overly difficult. 
Yeah, so the hardware almost certainly doesn't run python. Most hardware provides a serial or network interface that can be tapped into. The code they showed you is how they tap into the interface. It'll be almost trivial to port to 3.
Sorry for the somewhat misleading title, I had already had experience coding with PHP, I didn’t literally start programming last week. Just Python. Best of luck! The documentation of whatever API you’re using and Stackoverflow are your best friends. Follow tutorials and find examples online, I believe in you! 
Hmm. Without seeing the code I can't say but if your computations are taking less than two milliseconds I'm quite sceptical that more horsepower is going to do much. I recommend you do a Pi 3B+ and write the $35 off as part of the testing phase. Now if you honestly think the delta is too large I'd recommend an i3-7350k and you can overclock it to nearly 5GHz quite comfortably. This would be the cheapest way to get top tier performance where it matters. Custom kernels wouldn't be necessary neither would custom firewalls etc. So first do what I said about the location of your server, then do this. Do the Pi first though. They're inexpensive, and the power usage of an overclocked i3-7350k and additional cost of a full rig will be very unlikely to worth it. Why is the import of the data over the api taking so long? I frequently set up microservices that consume megabytes/second and I very rarely go over a few milliseconds. Which libraries are you using? Are you accessing a database at all? Opening and closing connections to databases can be a little slow. Does your code wait for IO operations at any point? If so we can use async to reduce wait times, but probably not applicable for you. 
From my understanding they are doing option 3. But the only connection to the hardware is via Ethernet so it might be a combination of options 2 and 3. Thanks for the link, that will be super helpful!
Did you miss [Further consideration of this PEP has been deferred until Python 3.8 at the earliest.](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0505/#pep-deferral)?
You get to say `return fast_lookup() or slow_create()`. You get to say `return found_results or default_results`. The short circuiting aspect of logical operators is too intuitive and readable to restrict to just booleans. 
Did you have any programming knowledge before going into Python you're completely new to all of this?
If you see import ctypes anywhere it's likely option 3. If you see .query(somestring) or similar it's scpi

Yep, possible. Check out r/learnpython 
I'm not really sure releasing the source to this is the best idea, considering the misuse potential.
There isn’t and there shouldn’t be. Hidden variables aren’t Pythonic. 
However they can make development faster.
I strongly suggest that you read and implement the recommendations here [Porting Python 2 Code to Python 3](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/pyporting.html). It'll be more work in the short term but you'll make major gains in the medium to long term.
They all have solvers. This way Googles Dev team has one to work against too. Not that they care very much until it's heavily exploited
I like try/except to deal with different kind of problems, for instance I find this kind of code elegant (a.ka. clear for other devs): try: application.function() except ApplicationError as ae: user_interface.warn('You, or one of your colleagues, did something wrong: %s' %str(ae)) except (DbIoError, NetTimeoutError, MonkeysOnServerRoomError): user_interface.error('System is down, please try again later') except: user_interface.error('Generic error, contact your IT support') else: user_interface.notify_success() Also, I use try/except to handle changes in some API input, say you have to maintain an API and suddenly one of the 10 callers have to change the input (for any business related reason) from a list to a dict, that's how I would handle it: def an_api_that_has_always_existed(json_stuff): data = json.loads(json_stuff) try: data = [v for k, v for data.items()] except AttributeError: pass finally: ret = do_something_with_a_list(data) return ret I know that the caller has a duty to respect the specifications of the api, but in real world sometimes your boss will tell you to adapt the api instead of telling them to adapt to the api. You can use `isinstance(data, dict)` which is even more clear, but this way I'm not forced to handle every possible incoming data type. [I like this article on this topic.](https://jeffknupp.com/blog/2013/02/06/write-cleaner-python-use-exceptions/) In the end I think is just an habit to choose EAFP instead of LBYL..
Got it working using the below code: `from ftplib import FTP` `ftp=FTP('`[`10.1.3.100`](https://10.1.3.100)`')` `ftp.login(user='addy', passwd='addypassword@321')` `ftp.cwd('../')` `files = ftp.nlst()` `for file in files:` `print ("Downloading..." + file)` `ftp.retrbinary("RETR " + file, open("" + file, 'wb').write)` `filename = 'test.txt'` `ftp.storbinary('STOR ' + filename, open(filename, 'rb'))` `ftp.quit()`
I'm on my phone right now. So I only managed to "read" through your code and not actually run it. From what I understand, i am concerned about your *foods* variable. In the while loop, you call food_create() which is supposed to append to the food variable. However I don't think your funtion always sees an updated copy of foods. Maybe food_create() should return *foods* variable? (Lemme know if what I said above isn't clear. I might think of a better way to explain it. ʘ‿ʘ)
I don't think anyone of Python's designers ever made any claims about soundness or even coherence in a broader sense of Python's type system. The truth is that that it's anything but. Types of expressions are totally dependent on the context they are used in, so, some things in some contexts may appear to have bottom type, while in other contexts they may be a subtype of top type etc. Practical Python programmers simply learn how their interpreter works, and some special contexts where things might behave strangely, and just roll with it.
use enumerate
Hmm ok, for the first function you lose a lot of error information(maybe some error info you haven't thought about for example), especially with the generic except but maybe your function is supposed to also post that on output idk. For the second i would write it with isinstance. I looked up EAFP and LBYL and there was a good point in the python manual that at least in a threaded environment you could run into race conditions without EAFP. I don't know why but i think it is clearer to be upfront in the code about what condition this should run under. Maybe it's a case of wanting to be consistent too, while with all the other if statements in the code... When there's a mix of ifs and try's and excepts i think it's ugly.
FYI a google search for "Shine On You Crazy Diamond, Parts I-V spotify" finds it perfectly.
If I understand correctly, you are saying that i should add a return(foods) statement because not all the list elements are printed? But i checked and saw that on collision the new turtle object gets appended to the list (foods) and also the previous list elements are also there, which is what i intended to do. If you get the time could you please run the code and tell me why the speed of the player turtle reduces on collision....Thanks.
why are you using: wn = turtle.Turtle() and then 1. turtle.color("black") 2. turtle.bgcolor("black") and not wn.color("black") and so on? wn is your instance of the class (object) and you are changing the class itself. Then in food\_create you are alway creating no single objekt and instead of creating a new object your are appending the whole class of turtle.Turtle() on the list foods\[\]. and then you are changing the class itself (but always to the same thing). better : def food\_create(c1, c2): newfood = turtle.Turtle()) newfood .goto(random.randint(-280,280), random.randint(-280, 280)) newfood .right(random.randint(0, 360)) fnewfood .color("red") newfood .width(10) newfood .shape("circle") newfood .pu() newfood .speed(0) foods.append(newfood ) But I have a question: is the food "destroyed" on contact? I don't see the code for it oh and you never call the function food\_generator()
What should "proxy_source" be set to in config.py? Will update if I figure this out myself.
It is a bit unclear, my apologies. That's mostly for if you use one of the included scripts (app.py or run.py) which loads the proxy source(proxy_source) from the settings file. You are free to rip that function if needed. Otherwise you can leave it blank and the proxy used will be defined in Solver.proxy. async def get_proxies(): global proxies proxies = [] while 1: src = settings["proxy_source"] protos = ["http://", "https://"] if any(p in src for p in protos): f = util.get_page else: f = util.load_file result = await f(settings["proxy_source"]) proxies = iter(shuffle(result.strip().split("\n"))) await asyncio.sleep(10 * 60)
If you want to avoid SQL and still want something easy to use then look up ZODB. Basically, you make your own data objects, store them in a database and use normal Python filtering logic to retrieve the objects you want. No need for servers. I am not sure how big or how fast the ZODB databases are compared to SQL. I used a database with objects with a few dozen fields of which some were quite longs strings or lists of strings. The size of the database for ~50k objects was around 100-150mb and a simple filtering took about 0.1s on my compter, which was good enough for me. Yours would probably be quite smaller and faster since you only have a few simple fields. Other options I would can suggest are sqlite and just simply using JSON files.
Ok so I think I hacked round it by `setting self._proxies = None` in Solver. Will make a more elegant solution. Current script output is: ``` Running on http://0.0.0.0:5000 (CTRL + C to quit) Clicking checkbox Waiting failed: timeout 15000ms exceeds. Clicking audio button Downloading response Received answer "play are very bland" Typing answer We were detected Time elapsed: 27.88547992706299 Clicking checkbox Waiting failed: timeout 15000ms exceeds.

Awesome, but proxy should default to None if none is supplied with Solver such as Solver(siteurl=SITEURL, pagekey=PAGEKEY) Thanks, use it wisely - this could ban your IP from ReCAPTCHAs for some time if used without a proxy!
I'm curious as to how this would bring criminal charges?
I might be terribly wrong but I think the influence of past results on the current tournament is a bit too small. Have you measured the effect of 2010 on 2014? I for one would be interested in the results
IANAL but computer tampering is vague enough to claim anything unlawful.
I made a reddit bot and got it banned lmao I should propably repurpose it but i don't have any ideas 
Indeed. It's not hard to imply "unauthorised access to a computer system or network" from this.
Something like this you need: https://gist.github.com/impshum/774d3db6ea08fbffeb3da2bf051a80f7
And if you read the first comment on that page, you'll see they haven't removed them; they just don't display them on the page. &gt; This isn't a bug, we've purposely de-emphasized PGP on Warehouse. While we support uploading them still and they're still a part of the API, we're not exposing them to the user in the UI.
No need to apologize. Thank you bud
Yes something like that but when I search for 'William Shakespeare' it should show me quotes only by William Shakespeare. Or let's say I search for quotes containing the word 'discipline' then it should match, scrape and create a new word file containing quotes containing the word discipline. I should also be able to set a restriction on the number of words or total quotes scraped.
I've worked around the issue, not the best but in my case it works well enough. In example.py, instead of `points1, points2, intrinsic = house()`, I build `points1` and `points2` from `ps1` and `ps2`, which are my original input points. `p1s = [[all_xs], [all_ys]]` [Example gallery](https://postimg.cc/gallery/qpwoc5bm/) # parameters set up by original author for dino example width = 576 height = 720 intrinsic = np.array([ [2360, 0, width / 2], [0, 2360, height / 2], [0, 0, 1]]) # points from Babylon.js example p1s = [[281.51442793258764,268.1083169872709],[287.8091268079961,262.6008847443267],[293.97195611391516,257.30217526148795],[299.9304159462417,252.16408504265019],[305.6109060225385,247.13811601561008],[310.93755083995813,242.1754880081279],[315.8312624226167,237.22726213376535],[320.2091433759468,232.24454341754824],[323.9843592390277,227.1788341150109],[327.06663842202954,221.9826121426259],[329.3635845641849,216.61020917732424],[330.78300079640843,211.01905634856976],[331.2364149139024,205.17134682176084],[330.64394179553926,199.0361279575825],[328.9405058046199,192.59177564822758],[326.08325611329366,185.8287173391664],[322.0597389816416,178.7521620838352],[316.8960640369696,171.38448009841076],[310.6639723234404,163.7667779625821],[303.4854756295062,155.9591773220382],[295.5337061100304,148.03936556542294],[287.02889641250505,140.09917338752626],[278.2290415636636,132.23923978127877],[269.4156992418987,124.56219669953701],[260.8763642901532,117.16514896322069],[252.88562985374688,110.13243262468178],[245.6876699722469,103.52962971233903],[239.48232934974857,97.39958861509918],[234.4163583446493,91.76081221660272],[230.58031817643325,86.60814444099421]] p2s = [[381.41723826649246,311.4729732567199],[387.5838987143935,305.14680004668463],[392.52038847372233,298.9277636089425],[396.0970003541521,292.7281824918944],[398.176612833154,286.4585707051783],[398.6176371049173,280.0278256925247],[397.27915533643227,273.34404912916136],[394.028755628582,266.31622634250317],[388.7534956381529,258.8569934731229],[381.37419332333315,250.88668046616738],[371.86278278459827,242.33870486664773],[360.26174023909,233.16617979651173],[346.7036002515472,223.34927818942236],[331.4274878561394,212.9024889387458],[314.7886947586356,201.88049064112346],[297.25708022842946,190.38110043390017],[279.4009506673696,178.5438104765894],[261.85531048969756,166.54294666709623],[245.2767247702968,154.57547696387533],[230.29061912211952,142.84475023025323],[217.43939897084525,131.5425640216708],[207.14019442281543,120.83251224126472],[199.65898964323665,110.83730584175419],[195.1040525438949,101.63177196203775],[193.43731733650705,93.24188974914507],[194.49908112657525,85.64898408161764],[198.03985297554462,78.79741957230294],[203.75343987050874,72.60392530262536],[211.30679182896301,66.96692849446227],[220.36400519301884,61.774769694965194]] points1 = np.array([ [_p[0] for _p in p1s], [_p[1] for _p in p1s], [1 for _ in range(len(p1s))], ]) points2 = np.array([ [_p[0] for _p in p2s], [_p[1] for _p in p2s], [1 for _ in range(len(p2s))], ]) 
Them keeping the PGP internally is not something I should be concerned with, the real question is how can I (as a developer) be able to verify whether the package that just landed on my machine through `pip` is the same that the author of the package signed, in the absence of PGP? 
You can put 'asdf' in a custom container that yields a tuple.
This is a difficult problem and the solution isn't python-specific. You probably want some algorithm/math/computer science sub.
Then go find that data and use it.
Agree, I was going to move to /r/math or similar, but as I had a python code *almost* working, I was hopping to understand it and modify it somehow. In fact this is what has happened at the end. I read some papers about the algorithms Open CV uses in this case, and I get the idea, but I don't really understand it.
Obviously they don't want you to be able to do that anymore.
If I had to guess, OP is looking for the it_index of the unicodeiterobject struct, declared here https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Objects/unicodeobject.c#L15291 (This is in the current master branch of CPython)

Use the artist name and get all albums by them on spotify into a list and then work from the with the matching. A lot of suggestions on matching, but reducing the pool of candidates that way is going to make what technique you use easier. 
Yes. I should pull it from sites like brainyquote or goodreads
This has got me intrigued, but I'm trying really hard not to think about it. I have real work to do!
How do you know the signature you retrieved from there is the same one the author uses? If you can trust them for the signature, why not for the package, too?
I am curious as to the reasons why you chose IDLE?
&gt;If you ever want to know what’s going on behind the scenes, at least for cPython, you can read the source: I was afraid to do that, because after trying to read some UNIX tools sources, I was dumbfounded and convinced I should never even attempt to read C written by pros. Surprisingly I think I get what's going on in the file you referred. Thanks.
pgp is worthless anyway, so I wouldn’t worry too much.
Some reasoning can be seen this blog post: [Package signing is not the Holy Grail](https://caremad.io/posts/2013/07/packaging-signing-not-holy-grail/). Also [this mailing list discussion](https://mail.python.org/pipermail/distutils-sig/2018-March/032066.html). Last I heard about this stuff, the idea was that they were going to be implementing TUF ([The Update Framework](https://theupdateframework.github.io/)). I have no clue what that is or what's the current progress, but that was the idea.
I think you are confusing PGP with MD5 or SHA1. The latter two have been know to have rendered weak due to advances in computing, but the former algorithm is [still rock solid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy#Security_quality). &gt; To the best of publicly available information, there is no known method which will allow a person or group to break PGP encryption by cryptographic or computational means. Indeed, in 1995, cryptographer Bruce Schneier characterized an early version as being "the closest you're likely to get to military-grade encryption."
Put down the IDLE and step away, towards a sane text editor, or maybe even an IDE.
I think it’s be nice if they dropped the PySide name and switched to QtPy. Then the real fun will begin.
Using an iterable in a for loop creates an iterator object that uses the original iterable. You usually can't do more than call `next()` on it though. iterable = 'asdf' iterator = iter(iterable) print(iterator) next(iterator) next(iterator) next(iterator) next(iterator) 
Its not part of Python the specification but there are hacky ways to get at it because it obviously exists in CPython. Obviously a bad idea since screwing with iterators while iterating over them is not a great idea. You can ~~can wrap range objects to~~ (apparently you can't wrap range objects) force them to reveal themselves. instances = [] class visiblerange: def __init__(self, i): global instances instances.append(self) self.i = i self.c = 0 def __iter__(self): return self def __next__(self): if self.c &lt; self.i: r = self.c self.c +=1 return r raise StopIteration def __repr__(self): return f'&lt;VisibleRange: {self.c}' print(instances) for v in visiblerange(3): print(instances) print(instances) This if you run this it will print out the list and you can see that the iterator is actually being modified.
Thanks for the advice. I'll give SQLite a go as my next step. The native python support will be a bonus.
I'll give that a shot. I actually ended up just going the extra mile and defining each subset of data as a variable because I endup calling back to it numerous times.
No, I’m talking about PGP. A bug in almost every popular implementation that existed for a decade allowed people to spoof most anyone.
No problem - the worst case would be two different Jupyter installations. It is fairly common for people to have more than one Python installation, with some redundancy in packages. You could probably do some debloating and set them up for different kinds of tasks. As to notebooks you already have, they can be used with Anaconda if / when the supporting packages are installed.
I don't really understand the title.
OP isn't the only one who can build such a thing.
Great post! Does somebody have a deep explanation for this comment from the source code: "This is meant to prohibit the latency-adverse behaviour on multi-core machines where one thread would speculatively release the Gil" If I understood correctly that's the main reason why switch condition exists, it seems like a very interesting detail of the speculative execution mechanism and I am curious about what is the full reasoning behind this behavior. 
Just to add another potentially useful library: I've used [Jellyfish](https://github.com/jamesturk/jellyfish) and had great success with the Jaro Winkler algorithm.
I would imagine searching by artist name along with song name would help a lot?
enumerate does not store the whole string anywhere. I was interested in using the variable to address dictionaries: d = {1: 2, 3: 4, 5: 6, 7: 8} for k in d: print(k, d[k]) # it was easy, right? now try to access keys of the dictionary from expression list: del d for k in {1: 2, 3: 4, 5: 6, 7: 8}: # creating unnamed iterator print(k, 'k corresponding value here') # how to print the corresponding value? The unnamed generator is the result of calling `dict.iterkeys()`, not `dict.iteritems()`, so you have no way of getting the key's corresponding value. Similarly, `enumerate(str)` will provide you with a generator of tuples `[index, letter]`, and not the handle to the whole string `str`.
`api_key = os.environ[‘API_KEY’]` is a great way to cheaply do this, or a json file and parsing it do a dict with json.loads
As an extension you can always also just make a callable object function which quickly grabs a reference to an iterator before it gets launched, to avoid the global mess. class ReferenceGrabber: def __init__(self): self.iterator = None def __call__(self, iterable): self.iterator = iter(iterable) return self.iterator g = ReferenceGrabber() for thing in g([1, 2, 3]): print(g.iterator) You can do some pretty diabolocal stuff if you wanted. 
What is yagmail?
This is one of the most popular python courses online. There's no right answer. Everyone chooses their own path. 
Well everything is correct there. First consider that None is the same as False for logical operators. For the 'and': if first argument is logically False, second will not be checked, first will be returned. For the 'or': if first argument is logically True, second will not be checked, but if it's not True, it will be. As result you get last logical False as result. As logical False could be considered a lot of things: empty sequence, empty string, False, None, 0, you can even define false for your custom class
Could possibly solve the song not found thing in a few ways. Since the data in both places is relatively static or slow to change doing string parsing with another method (I’m assuming you’re already using a regex?) could be viable. Another method would be to get more info about the song to try and classify it in some way. E.g; this song is a rock song, from England, in the 60s. If your Spotify query for that fails you could try searching for other songs you’ve been able to classify with those attributes, dropping classifiers until you get a match, or default to a sample from a known working list. As also mentioned you could store a list of known good queries to fall back on. This could be done as an in memory cache, file cache, or DB/other outside storage mechanism. Is suspect this app is stateless so I’d be hesitant to add a DB or some form of persistence unless you just wanted to for fun or learning.
I work on painless persistence service (aka. database) to help in prototyping stuff without knowledge of SQL (ie. it's somewhat a replacement for sqlite as service): [https://github.com/amirouche/deuspy/](https://github.com/amirouche/deuspy/) Also, I made a very tiny small webapp using asyncio aiohttp: [https://github.com/amirouche/quicoeur.fr](https://github.com/amirouche/quicoeur.fr) I hope to use both projects in a workshop at [PyConFR 2018](https://cfp-2018.pycon.fr/cfp/)! I also improve my wiredtiger cffi binding: [https://github.com/amirouche/python-wiredtiger-ffi](https://github.com/amirouche/python-wiredtiger-ffi)

thanks!
[Read this](https://www.davidfischer.name/2012/05/signing-and-verifying-python-packages-with-pgp/) to understand how its done. Basically, you'll need the public key signature of the author (if available and published, of course) like David Fischer in this example. Once you download the package's pgp from PyPi and the author's pgp separately and compare them, you can verify its authenticity that way.
