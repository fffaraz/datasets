In fact, there has been long running issue _around_ this subject which *has* led to _user configurable_ output templates.
Sometimes the best thing is to try something, even if you find out later it’s the wrong approach. So you learned two things: how to solve the problems your way with the learning approach you took, and gained exposure to a better method. You also put yourself out there by writing about your solution, and didn’t take offense when a better alternative was suggested. Sounds like a good day all around! 
anyone has idea how the classes are actually conducted ?
yeah I saw it. it's baffling to imagine how hard it is to add a fucking pivot switch 
Check the sidebar.
you are right it overwrites I would need to find an another way to merge dictionaries
Just flip the order like my last line. 
I used dunder method to have better looking code instead putting URLs to everywhere &amp;#x200B;
Start your first litte project, and just google things you need right now.
but what if its like ````python default = {'a': {'b': 1}} user = {'a': {'c': 1}} print({\*\default, \*\*user}) # {'a': {'c': 1}}``` it should merge b and c, but your advice can be a fix for a short time.
Look into learning React-Native! It is a cross platform language for developing mobile apps, and it very similar to HTML while also using some Javascript.
&gt; Completely new to coding...... &gt; programming machine learning algorithms. it's a long way but start here: r/learnpython 
This looks super useful, get it on pypi/readthedocs?
actually it is on the pypi I forgot to mention it thank you for reminding
ohhh, yeah, a nested dictionary is going to require probably recursively iterating over all the keys and merging each layer.
This is cool but the double-&gt;triple underscore isn't very nice to look at. How about one of the following...? api.anything.endpoint.get() (api / 'anything' / 'endpoint').get() api.anything_endpoint.get() The first is my favorite, although it's comparatively less efficient. Each `__getattr__()` call would create a new path-y object, adding the requested attribute's name, and the final `__call__()` call would discard the last-added name &amp; use it as an HTTP method. Second works similarly but it's modeled after pathlib. I don't like it but it's an option. Third is the most similar to what you currently have, but it replaces double with single underscores and the triple underscores with a separate instance method. Visually I don't like it as much as #1, but I feel like it's the most-acceptable tradeoff... thoughts?
Tetris is supposed to have a semi-random algothrim called Tetromino Order. I don't see that he implemented this in his code, but I only browsed through it. Google it.

This is impressive. Must have been fun, and also a great advertisement for curses! I've been working on a tetris (hey we all do it, right?) and took inspiration from [this one](http://zetcode.com/gui/pyqt5/tetris/). Look how he handles defining the shape of the tetronimos and esp. the very elegant method of rotating. Not well commented but worth analyzing.
Hmm i’m still learning Python but i’m trying to understand if a normal positional argument (url, method) would be cleaner?
To be perfectly honest with you, Python isn’t the best language to start on. Sure, it’s easy, takes care of a lot of the annoying things for you that other languages don’t, but it’s almost to “easy” and that’s where people struggle. The hardest part about programming is learning how to think like a programmer, language doesn’t matter, it’s the thought process and dissecting the problem into chunks that’s hard. Personally, I’d recommend C++ or JS, I know people will want to shoot me for saying that, but it’s a lot easier when learning to scroll up and see what type X variable is when you forget. Just my $0.02
You have to stop reading and watching videos and just build somthing. Make a linked list. Make a lambda and a router and a map Use list comprehensions. Take and store some ussr input, make a simple guess a number game. Build a binary tree, sort it, search it. Do these things without using built in functions. Then go back and optimize your code using built in functions. Create a class, and make a class object do somthing. Read and write to files. You can only learn so much by reading and watching. Don't just copy and past make sure you understand what your code is actually doing and if you don't, then start from there. 
actually not because we are actaully passing path not url after you set base_url there is no need to pass url
Ah i meant to say path. So using your example: # What you have api.anything__endpoint____get() # What i think may be cleaner and more readable? api.get(‘/anything/endpoint’)
There isn't really a best language to start on. The best one to start on will be the one that gets you to keep going. Any object oriented language is a good place to start. Learning plain old C is what really helped me understand the concept of pointers, linked lists and data structures like stacks and queues. The important thing is that what ever language you start with you keep learning. The underlying concepts of programming don't change from language to language, at this point it's just syntactic sugar.
Make it anyways! There’s a million calculators, snake games, and webscrapers but each one is great practice.
in readme file I wrote "AnyAPI is a library that I developed for myself to have a better looking code instead putting URLs to everywhere" this is one of the essential feature of this library if you still want to use it like that you can check [here](https://github.com/FKLC/AnyAPI/wiki/4.-What-if-endpoint-includes-dashes,-dots-or-etc%3F)
Sorry didn’t see that until now. Great effort in totality!
Not sure if its by a different name, But my 7-Bag randomizer is what's stipulated in the Tetris guidelines. you put the IDs of the pieces in a list (the bag), shuffle the list, proceed through it, then when you reach the end, shuffle the bag again.
This is really cool! 
With curses, you get the underlying grid of characters in the terminal to work with. In an abstract way, the screen acts as a big chunk of memory, where each character is an address. This was to my advantage in this game. However, curses limits any graphics you want to ASCII character art, as it runs in a terminal. My only advice for graphics design is to get either GIMP or Aseprite.
thank you
Yeah, I just saw this in the description. You implemented it correctly. I learned of this Algorithm and the Name from r/dailyprogrammer challenge a few years back. Good job. 
Reminds me of [uplink](https://pypi.org/project/uplink/). What is the difference?
Reminds me of sdispater - poetry and pendulum. Amazing libraries to use, horrendous libraries to contribute to and understand
The pieces move character by character, no fractional stuff. I've used Guake and Terminator so far, my personal termemus Also yeah, it's 2019. Python 2 support is ending soon (so I heard?), and in Arch, the package for Python 3 is just called `python`. Still, a language check is just a couple lines.
👍
actually I can't see any differences out of dynamic method calls maybe I would paste uplink github link as for advanced users in the next version.

Progress bars are cool I suppose, but OP is an absolute beginner looking for the basic libraries. Requests, pandas, numpy would be much better places to start than a progress bar. 
&gt; honestly i don't think that's a "bug". if someone runs code with the wrong language it's hardly surprising if it doesn't work. &gt; &gt; It's not the "wrong language" it's the "wrong language version". Checking for your minimum supported version is something many many programs do.
I may have tried to move the piece before it spawned. I don't remember however. 
On Mac OS X (my system) python points to Python 2 by default.
Well that's news to me. I'll add the check. /s Thanks Apple.
It may have changed on the most recent OS, I'm on 10.13 and most recent is 10.14, bu I doubt it. On 10.13.6 the Python 2 version that it comes with is specifically 2.7.10 and it does not come with Python 3 installed by default. I've installed newer versions of both manually and I was using Python 2.7.15 and Python 3.7.1.
Super cool! I guess I just don't understand how writing dynamic function calls is different than writing URLs. It actually means you can't use variables to store endpoints unless you use some __ method which would defeat the purpose. Nice nevertheless.
Build something already. Google when you get stuck. Become a programmer.
 &gt;&gt;&gt; a=[[1,2,3,4],[5,6,7,8],[9,10,11,12]] &gt;&gt;&gt; list(zip(*a)) [(1, 5, 9), (2, 6, 10), (3, 7, 11), (4, 8, 12)]
You can delete and create your object again and all the methods will be reset. If you wrap everything in a function like this `def calculate() # create object # do the rest` the object will be deleted (it is called ”garbage collection”) on this function exit automatically (except if you pass it with `return` outside - it won't necessarily be garbage so it may not be collected). It’s really very simple. Take a step back and rethink what you know about functions. Reloading a module will achieve exactly the same thing, but is more… an unusual approach, weird even: the module will be destroyed and your object with it along. When you load it again, a fresh object will be created again.
Automating reporting for colleagues so they don’t have to spend hours copying and pasting data into Excel. Probably saving 5 hours of manual work that has to be done every other week.
Cool project! Any reason why you picked dunder to replace slashes instead of using dots? And similarly triple underscore for request type?

This also reminds me of hammock too.
does this library have the shot location data? like the X,Y coordinates? if so could you please show an example on how to use. I am a beginner and the 1 project i reallllly want to make is a shot chart. there are examples online that are out dated. anything would help. thanks a million
You mean docstrings? 
idk but great suggestion now I'm working on a automatic proxy changer according to rate limits specified from user after that I would probably work on your suggestion thank you again
Or contribute to this project. 
That's not actually a bad idea. 
yes you cant store them as variables this is a con :(

also I have never hammock too but this library also such a cool library using dots instead of double underscores is even better than my idea I can might be implement same to AnyAPI
Done. [https://github.com/cSquaerd/CursaTetra/commit/4791b7a9e7f3b2fb0829161aad3707c33d72ff7c](https://github.com/cSquaerd/CursaTetra/commit/4791b7a9e7f3b2fb0829161aad3707c33d72ff7c)
Yes :) I do mean docstrings
Well that would change current API by quite a bit, but maybe would look like more of an object to interact with :) 
Probably because it's a pretty trivial wrapper around requests, which is already a nice interface for interacting with HTTP API's. It seems the benefit here is that you're only defining pieces that are common to all requests to the API once which is nice, but I don't need a separate library to do it for me. Personally, I would prefer strings to define the endpoint as I see the dunder method not providing any real value and may actually limit flexibility (for instance getting a resource with a particular ID that you fetched from a previous request). I don't want to discourage the OP as it's always good to hone your skills and keep creating and trying new things, but my initial impression was this was an over-engineered library for an idea (a good one) that could realistically be executed in half the lines of code.
Totally agree! It became a lot more useful by 3.6 (expanduser was added in 3.5, and Pathlike was finally supported across standard Python modules and libraries). You still need to accommodate third-party modules by casting a Pathlike to a string sometimes, but its my go-to module for handling paths.
The most people will suggest something like tkinter, qt or gtk. Theres nothing wrong in it but another idea is to learn flask. I think 2-4 weeks with flask and a bit html, css and js you have much more freedom in gui development. And youre able to host your little projects for free for example pythonanywhere.com
I would recommend Fluent Python. You can check the review from here [https://www.programmingbookreviews.com/best-python-book-2019/](https://www.programmingbookreviews.com/best-python-book-2019/)
That's coz you are using " inside of your string. You can omit those using / or \ (I don't remember exactly) or you can use ' Example: 'abc"def' or "abc\"def"
I hope he's not that dumb
Wait could you show me how to do that inside my string as I don't really understand
You mention a syntax error but you didn't include it in your comment. On first glance, I would say you're missing +'s on the right hand side of name, address and age, and missing +'s on each side of gender. I would also suggest using f-strings or some other string formatting technique rather than using the string concat method (using +'s).
[https://github.com/samgiles/slumber](https://github.com/samgiles/slumber) [https://github.com/datafolklabs/drest](https://github.com/datafolklabs/drest) [https://github.com/shazow/apiclient](https://github.com/shazow/apiclient) [https://github.com/vintasoftware/tapioca-wrapper](https://github.com/vintasoftware/tapioca-wrapper) hammock, finch and many more...
Right off the bat, I see `+` missing after `name`, `address`, `age`, and before and after `gender`
Look up 'format' or probably just 'print' in the documentation.
Make your print statements like this, it's much cleaner (sorry for formatting, I'm on mobile): s = 'Are these details okay?\n' s += 'Name: %s\n' % name s += 'Address: %s\n' % address s += 'Gender: %s\n' % gender s += 'Age: %s\n' % age s += 'Email: %s\n' % email s += '[Y/N]' print(s)
I said progress bar because: 1. Those packages were already mentioned by others. 2. A simple progress bar is much more basic than any of those three packages and can be used right away. 3. For loops are going to be used more often than any package. 4. Those packages tend to be the kind of thing you're bound to run into on StackOverflow anyway, just to be able to accomplish certain tasks.
/r/learnpython is a better place to ask questions such as this. Please follow the [guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/faq) of that subreddit, when posting thre.

Why not just change print order?

Just for the record: By now I created a class called "ScreenCapturer" which contains the code for the clientside (ScreenCaptureClient) and the serverside (ScreenCaptureServer). For further information here is the link to the README ([https://github.com/N00NY/ScreenCapturer/blob/master/README.md](https://github.com/N00NY/ScreenCapturer/blob/master/README.md)). I also posted some examples of how it works, but in my opinion they are pretty wack. So if you have questions left just drop them here or pm me and I'll try to answer them as soon as possible.
Parallel processing with the multiprocessing package is quite useful if you are doing data science of any kind.

For someone as dumb as myself, could you show an example of how to convert a html page to a standard .pdf file and save to c:\temp, for example? I tried to understand your doc in the repo and used the --help option in the console (both same) Nearest I could get was: pypppdf www.mypage.html which displayed base64 gobbledygook in the console, pypppdf --c:\temp www.mypage.html comes up error. "no such option as --c" Please excuse my ignorance. using Python3.65 on windows 7 64bit

Wow thanks, just coded the next Watson thanks to you!
The TV show Silicon Valley has a character who codes something very similar. 
If you have a string like this : `"A string with " in"`, python will think the string stop on the first. You could do either `'A string with " in'` or `"A string with \" in"`
Statically typed languages (and programmers) spent an inordinate amount of effort trying to get around static typing. It's only appreciated in the sense that children appreciate a light left on when they sleep because they believe a monster is under the bed or in the closet. 
&gt; Like being extremly component in Java would be beneficial if the job offer &gt;was c#, or Scala. Tell that to the human resources staff member or the hiring manager. Being competent in Java doesn't familiarize you with the vast breadth and depth of the .NET library for ecosystem, among other things. It doesn't acquaint you with the "gotchas" of C#. Why hire this person when they can hire someone who has actually programmed in Java and can hit the ground running?
No, it's not. OP wrote " If you're applying via blind applications through the company portal..." Apparently their job hunt plan involves knowing the person doing the hiring and being able to persuade them in person or something. The reality is that resumes are screened by computer programs today and those that don't meet the criteria posted in the job ad are tossed out before a human ever sees them. In fact, past experiments have shown that a **perfect** resume put into these screening programs only pops out on average 1/6 of the time! 
Both. I'm assuming he is the only user of this
There are some modules that only support one of those ways of doing it. If I can do it either way, however, I prefer the latter, unless it's so long that in my code it ends up making my lines over 80/100 characters long.
Oh I have so many stories I could tell you, like the one person who insisted type inference was "just the compiler guessing" and refused to believe it was a mathematically proven technology in use in computer languages today, the uber fan who told me that if we lived closer he would settle his differences with me "via more old-fashioned, physical means", the fellow who took a 50% pay cut to keep working with Delphi rather than learn a new language and now is considering turning his home into a B&amp;B because he can't find a single Delphi job anymore.....

Hey all! Just wanted to share my game but also wanted to highlight [pyxel](https://github.com/kitao/pyxel) as a python game library. If you haven't heard of it, it's a really cool, easy to use retro game library. If you have heard of it but haven't checked it out for a while, have another look. Kitao has been absolutely slaying it, and pyxel now has a really nice editing tool that covers images, tiles, sounds, and music. It also has some stubs and type annotations so everything works smoothly with your IDE. There are a bunch of user made games listed [here](https://github.com/kitao/pyxel/wiki#user-samples).
&gt; Generic type IO[AnyStr] and its subclasses TextIO(IO[str]) and BinaryIO(IO[bytes]) represent the types of I/O streams such as returned by open(). https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.IO
Just jumping in – I'm a big [pyxel](https://github.com/kitao/pyxel) fan for games/graphics. Nicer than the terminal, but nowhere near as complex as pygame. Really good tradeoff IMO.
I recently created for me a web scrapper that will email me a summary of the cheapest train trips in the coming 3 months. My next project is to build something to delete useless emails on my different mail boxes.
Hey, if you end up accidentally writing dwarf fortress I'ld consider that a win. 
You aren’t very good at your game
Or use numpy...
I didn’t want to discourage people playing it with my awesomeness ;)
I just looked at the readme. That "gobbledygook" is the pdf. You can direct that output to a file using shell redirection (`&gt; something.pdf`) or with the `-o` option. 
Sometimes the simplest solutions are the best solutions. Most of the time, actually.
Looks great, if the path is /orders/my-order How would that look like in py syntax?
A lambda written in Python, parses excel from a file that is dropped into a S3 bucket, then runs ETL to sql/nosql
You have from selenium import webdriver In there twice
Or if its: /order/12220 or /order/&lt;var&gt;
Better question. What do you think this code does? Thanks for the tips! How could you use it?
Looks like it automatically logs a person in to a university website and then navigates to a particular place.
Would you know about #C? This is not the sub but would you know what [this](https://github.com/globant-sunil/EdgenuityATS) does as well. Thank you for the effort too! 
I created a script that templates subtitle hardcoding for video files. Made life so much better.

Lol I like your simple moving average strategy there 
I have a Telegram Bot that accesses our state’s fuel price API, and messages me a summary of the three cheapest service stations on my route home from work on the cheapest day. In our state, service stations are required to publish the next day’s prices, and these are consolidated by the state and updated at 2:30 pm every day. Note: We have a weird weekly fuel-pricing cycle in Western Australia, and prices start low on Sunday / Monday and increase over the week. No one has been able to explain to me why we have the price-cycle, but it leads to long and dangerous queues onto the roads at the cheapest service stations on Mondays. Is there anyone here who knows why WA has the price-cycle?
built a small bot for slack, so people from my job can ask my bot for stuff they want repeatedly from me (like monthly repprts, file new feature requests for our app etc) keeps them out from my office and now im not constantly interrupted.
A simple one that I wrote for work was that I have some annual reporting and the program that I uses spits out text files with the extension .SYN. I have about 180 of these each year and they have to be posted by me (corporate) for the field. 99% of them don't know how to save as a PDF so navigating right click open with text editor was harder to explain than just automating changing the extension of all 180 text files from .SYN to .txt. I've messed with some other stuff that's more math related topics like linearly interpolating data to quickly give me a single value that I might need for some manual hand calculations.
Have you won’t yet?
Beautiful soup for web scraping, xlrd and xlwt for Excel work. Basically any tedious text processing. Python with all the libraries available make parsing any document easy.
This is excellent
How do you even **see** the traffic on your repos?
letting users control their own content on plex, huge time saver
Or just simply: &amp;#x200B; def transpose\_matrix(matrix): return zip(\*matrix)
Just curious on how long it would take the average person to make a simple game like snake or the dinasour running e.t.c. how long did it take you to make this?
My guess is your MutableList is somehow broken. Hard to say just be that code alone...
You can do that with pypppdf -o c:\temp www.mypage.html (assuming "www.mypage.html" is a correct url or a file path)
I didn’t make the dinasour one, but snake was fairly quick and has relatively little code. It took me a Sunday afternoon, then about the same time again for the music / sound effects. 
Automated to download parquet files from s3 and save to my local in csv format. Generate power point deck using analytical data. Killing EMR cluster in AWS if no one is using them. 
This asteroids game probably took me 5-10 hours? Hard to track as I chip at it half an hour at a time. There’s a bit more time lying in bed thinking of how I’m going to implement the next bit. 
I was thinking about making a Astroids-like game with pixel art a lot recently. This is awesome! Thank you for sharing.
I made a script that takes a playlist file exported from iTunes (or wherever) and copies the files in the playlist to a folder in order on my usb drive so I can listen to the playlist in my car. 
ah thanks.
Damn. Did you use Selenium?
Smart!
Anymore details on this? Sounds interesting. Curious what you’ve come up with vs the available offerings out there. 
Is there a Slack API or there are any Slack plug ins available in Python?
What Python resources did you use to learn and build the program?
How? Does iTunes have an Python API or did you download the software and found the text document that contains all the songs in a directory of iTunes?
thanks, I get PermissionError [errno 13] permission denied, when it tries to save. tried it on D:\temp, same thing. pyppdf -o "D:\temp" http://stevebale.home.blog/
Oh I see thanks for the answer. Don't plan on making games but was always curious on how hard it is to make one.
Yes. Adding doc strings to your modules, classes, and functions is a great way to make your code more usable. As mentioned above, it allows the built in `help` function give you information about the piece of code. Also, this is better than the Javadoc/jsdoc style docstrings, since those are only compile time accessible.
Looks like a test automation system someone started, but quit working on a year ago before finishing. 
I have updated the Installation notes, please follow them. You are most welcome to submit issues and enhancement requests. Feel free to contribute, thanks.

Oh, my bad. I didn't noticed that to tried to rewrite a `C:\Temp` folder. You need to save to a file, like: pypppdf -o "%UserProfile%\Desktop\stevebale.home.blog.pdf" http://stevebale.home.blog/ 
Really cool, have you always wanted to make games? Or is this just a little side project?
It's mostly collision detection and rendering that are the hard bits
If you don't mind answering would you do an if else statement for it? Like if it comes too close then game over? 
I'm not sure if there's an event loop or something like that with the pyxel library they're using, but the approach I would take: check the bounding boxes between the game area, asteroids, and the player with each frame.
For this game I used a super simple method of collision detection assuming each object is a circle. Then you just compare the distance between the two objects (using the hypotenuse) to the combination of the two radiuses. Not perfect but works well enough. Sometimes the tip of the ship can pass through an asteroid without dying. 
Checkouts of software release, moving custom software libraries to HPC grid, data reduction, data queries, software and system verification, comparison of binary data, fantasy football draft tools, rapid post processing of telemetry with parallel processing, mirror directory trees only keeping certain file names / types, reports of disk usages via email, permutations of software input files...etc etc
Oh and pyxel totally has an event loop with two end points accessible to the user: an update function for game state and a display function for rendering - this allows it to skip frames if necessary. 
Database access. I built a self-service form that connects to global db clusters, auto-approves access and writes privileges on the cluster, or sends emails to data owners with yes/no links.
I wrote a script for photography that sends me push notifications for when heavy fog is forecast in the next couple of days since I love the way a moody/foggy landscape looks. Here’s one of my photos I got that these notifications help me plan for: [foggy Portland morning ](https://i.imgur.com/h5ytrOX_d.jpg?maxwidth=1920&amp;fidelity=high)

I first read "on Grub" and thought why the hell one would code a game to play in a bootloader :D &amp;#x200B;
Thanks! So I guess this [one](https://github.com/MarceDiazG/EdgenuityVS )would be the one that works? I found an [updated repository](https://github.com/MarceDiazG/ATS )of the test automation system here but it’s empty. Is it empty or is there a way you can still view it? Thanks in advance for the help too. It’s appreciated 😄
The photo looks amazing!
Nah - not really. I’m an accountant by trade and I only use python from time for automating data transformations or producing documents or reports and the like. Quite different from this stuff. I just saw this library and thought I’ld have a go at a simple game to test my python chops and it was funner than I expected! 
Thanks for the answer and good luck. 
Nah, static typing is great. That said, not having to type them out is also great. Being able to sketch a program in an interactive reply and then formalize it with types under mypy is one of my favorite ways of developing new stuff.
api.order.PATH(var).GET()
Yes you would! There are if else statements all over the place.
Yeah will probably look at some videos of someone making a simple game and seeing how it is done.

yes I noticed on one attempt it tried to save in C:\temp but inside my user dir. Thanks.
Well made Op 
Watching tutorials on Python to prepare for a Python developer job interview.
Very curious about this as well
Also note you can arbitrarily document *anything*. String literals (ex, one immediately after an assignment statement) are generally optimized out by the bytecode compiler. However tools like `sphinx` can still detect them.
a video downloader that supported youtube insta twitter vimeo and stuff..kinda like YouTube-dl but im the end i gave it a crappy web interface and rewrote some bits in js
step 1: look if somebody posted the solution to my problem on stack overflow step 2: look busy for as long as i don't want to do real work
Alright.... Added to the pile of projects to do. Thanks for your service!
Cheers!
Sentdex in YouTube is great
you are right you don't need any other library including mine but I just want to say even in the first release there is a make_request function which you can call weird paths or pass variables through it. now I released a new version now you can do the same without calling make_request just call api.anything.P(your_var).GET() 
It's a telegram bot with custom interfaces to the respective API's not much actual functionality, but it lets users request stuff with out exposing the actual API's and prevents duplicates. Here it is: https://gitlab.com/herpaderk/tgrsbot
now you can, changed api a litte now you can call with `P(path)` for example `api.user.P(username).GET()`
yes there is a lot of similar libraries I have added them [here](https://github.com/FKLC/AnyAPI#this-library-is-not-a-new-thing) not the all of them but at least Uplink and Hammock thank you for warning me
I wrote a telegram bot with custom API interfaces to radarr/sonarr. Not a ton of functionality, however it has enough to let users download what they want and not bother me, here is the link: https://gitlab.com/herpaderk/tgrsbot
Any feedback very welcome!
I went with the 2g option because the 4g option will not work on VoLTE anyways. And 3G is getting closed here in Norway as of this year. 2G will last to 2025. By then we might have 4G modules that operators have granted permissions for VoLTE, even better is the low power 4G voice that already exist modems off! Those who will replace 2G voice and data for alarms and a lot of things! LTE Cat-M1 is the future for excellent voice and low speed data! That is the module I want.

That's a Linux thing I believe. You need to p type pip in a shell, it's like the standard Downloader for command line systems. That's my basic understanding. Someone else can better explain it. 
I'm in speech analysis but for our customers I have to do the same thing very often so I made some scripts that scan a directory for new audio files, transcribe them, classify them and load them into our application. 
Just run `pip install pyserial`. Also, /r/learnpython.
&gt;pip install pyserial Thank you. Do you mean open IDLE and type the words "pip install pyserial" and then press enter?
Did you click the link here: &gt; If you're not sure which to choose, learn more about installing packages. ? I don't even see a .rst link to download so not really sure how you got that.
I built one for my server! It uses the Reddit PRAW to post images and gifs into the chat. `=get pics funny awww' posts the top 10 posts of the day from each of those subreddits :)
I'm really sorry, there's a .whl and .gz both of which I can't open. I checked out that link and still couldn't figure it out. I was hoping someone had this same issue and could say what htey did, possibly downloaded it from another site (which I also can't find) Thank you!
Archive Utility (included with Mac OS X--same program that opens Zip files) on Mac can open .tar.gz files natively. BTW, the other suggestion made in this thread is to use `pip install pyserial`. This same suggestion is made in the tutorial: https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/#installing-from-pypi If `pip` doesn't work, then you need to follow the earlier parts of the tutorial to make sure it is installed.
No, you need to run that command in your Terminal app.
Run reporting script as scheduled date.
That's def not normal Python you're installing there. Also it says 2.7, that's deprecated and won't work next year - use Python 3.6 or 3.7
puthonprogramming.net is his website.
Yeah Selenium because most of the content is generated through JS. But I am wondering about another alternative as I haven't been able to make it work on my server yet. I've read about requests-html so I'll give it a look. 
Thanks!
Writing others languages
is the reason this question gets asked so much because of the book "automate the boring stuff?" i never see it asked in any other language subs. for whatever reason, it seems to be a uniquely python question
u/DaFluffyPotato, creator of Super Potato Bruh made a cool video explaining some collision detection stuff. Worth checking out. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_YTklVVNoQ
No problem – hope you learn some stuff! Hopefully it's relatively easy to follow the code – I just added some docstrings to help.
I would suggest SoloLearn, it has many languages including a python course and is a decent tool considering it's free. 
I have a thing going where I send out a joke each day to multiple chat groups. I first send it into a discord channel where a bot gets it and stores it in a file, then `entr` starts the telegram bot to send it to the telegram group chat.
Ticket handling "business logic" in our ticketing system.
This was my immediate thought when you first posted this, and I see you've now implemented it. One thing you could improve is the returning a proper function instead of a lambda from `__getattr__`, so you can add a docstring.
traffic stats.
Where'd you get this installer? What is says is a lie: it won't work. `pip` needs to use certificates to download anything (but if it doesn't, that's an even worse disaster). Maybe try `brew` or Anaconda's Python. I have no idea why Python for Mac comes without certificates, I'd imagine there must be some sort of a legal issue here. But, I think `brew` or Anaconda somehow solved that legal conundrum.
Yes.

Check out https://realpython.com/async-io-python/
thank you for feedback
It's not a matter of need, it's a matter of practice. I don't see any reason *not* to when it's a built-in library.
Yeah, I see that now. Sorry
I automate my PC use by mixing bash and python. Scripts, etc.
Normally I would suggest reading the source of any module you want to understand at a deeper level, but asyncio may be the exception to that. I wrote a telnet chat server which uses the same core concepts as asyncio, but it is small enough to be digestible. If you can grasp how this works, then you will have a much better understanding of asyncio... https://github.com/willmcgugan/asyncchat 
Also remember /r/learnpython is a great place to ask for help when learning Python
Using pandas and python-pptx to create a Powerpoint deck from excel files. I mostly deal with reporting at work, so pandas is my best friend. Even for the not so automated stuff. Excel crashes way too often even with relatively small datasets ... ex: the other day it was crashing every single time I was trying to do a pivot table on a relatively small dataset of 50k rows. So, even for some ad hoc requests I use pandas over Excel. 
I'm still a bit confused about the offline mode in plotly. Do you know if you can do pretty much the same things you can with the online version, of is using "offline" mode limiting the features (ex: chart types, etc.)? 
To be fair, full fledged python from the grub shell would be a pretty notable accomplishment.
Do you mean this ? https://www.google.com/search?q=websocket+server+python&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-b-1-m
I heard you can do it without modules..
But that's exactly what you want to build right? Basically from scratch? You might not want to do it in python because you'll be basically replicating the core package. So the most productive thing you can do is literally trace the modules code and learn from it. If you still want to code it from scratch i'd suggest just doing it in C or golang. I wrote one a while back in college as a learning project in C. There's peobably text books with coding examples about it if you google hard enough. If you want something more modern then checkout golang. It's basically build for that type of work, but not give you the "pythonic" library where it's all black box magic. 
Just boring stuff
I think I will do it with python, cuz the project is simple, do you know any good module for that?
It may not be exactly what you are looking for, but here is a very good websocket server written in python : [https://github.com/crossbario/crossbar](https://github.com/crossbario/crossbar)
Ah, you might want to google, bud. I've never looked it up for python, and done it once in C, then "lightly" experiemented it with golang. But if you can find an API for squidServer (or squidProxy) that's one i liked. I used it to make a honeypot server for some sec project a while back (logging requests and trying to crack packages). 
They just started this year with it so I'll find out at the end of the month. Don't see how I could lose though lol.
Cool, do you have a source code available to share on github, if you are willing to do so of course ? 
sure I have uploaded it [on github](https://github.com/alexbennik/textakel). Next week I will add a github link on the website too

Post crap like that in /r/codegolf that it's implemented in Python does not make it topical here.

I wrote a bot that finds the top-ranked picture on r/aww once per day, and texts it to my girlfriend along with the post title using twilio. Best Christmas present ever.
I love the idea of having public code challenges.. very fun! I feel compelled to point out you're learning bad practices/habits . In python we want verbose (yet efficient) code. It's meant to be readable and easy to inherit. Unlike in other languages (C++, Java, etc), where short code snippits make it more readable. 
Reminds me of [agithub](https://github.com/mozilla/agithub) project. Thank you for sharing
What do you mean bad practices? Do you mean the way I have written the code is unreadable or you think the code golf concept itself diminishes the idea of quality code writing? Can you elaborate?
That's an interesting idea. Have you run it through a sniffing tool to see whether or not your true IP leaks when the script changes IP addresses mid-session? I see that all the time when examining server-side logs of clients using VPNs and proxies, when they switch IPs mid-session --- often I'll catch one request with the true IP. That would be my biggest concern in using something like this.
That's a really good point, I didn't think about that. I'll have to test that out. I agree though; if it leaks your IP for then it kind of defeats the point. I'll have to figure out how to get around that. Thanks for the feedback!

Try using a canvas widget from Tkinter. You'll have to redo your calculations to map to a 2d plane, but it should be lightweight enough to animate smoothly. Write a separate function to draw a grid over your canvas and another to draw a circle about given coordinates on the canvas. [Check out this link for some scaffolding code and an overview of the animation process.](https://medium.com/@elan_73479/python-tkinter-tutorial-4-making-a-animation-in-canvas-ff5801358e4e)
No problem. Since that's the kind of thing that VPN users would care about, as long as it *does* work, I'd include some documentation about those test results in your Github repo.
Why not use 1 script that performs all the commands...or you can use 1 "host" script that subs out the others...combined with multiprocessing...you'd be fine!
I'll try that! I actually have code for the[ bottom bar in tkinter](https://github.com/CoryC3K/AutoCoach/blob/master/tkinter_Bars_Concept.py) already (started there originally), and have code to convert to a standard Cartesian coordinate grid (did that before I tried speeding it up with a polar plot because it takes less math). Thanks! 
I love this! I've actually been working on an expense tracker for me and my wife this week as well. May I ask what your method is for automatically backing up your database?
The 3rd case can use \`extractall\` too, just filter the \`namelist\` via a listcomp beforehand.

let us know bro
I really like the code golf part. 🤓 Trying to write code in as few characters as possible is the issue. Code is two things at once. It gives the interpretor instructions on how your program works and it's communication to other developers. This approach is heavily skewed towards instruction and does badly with communication. The more you use it the the more complicated the code will become. The if else pattern is already optimized for form and function. Now instead of being instantly understandable by others, people have to mentally unpack what you've done and keep it in their head. That slows down reading speeds and makes it harder to jump around in the code. The Zen of python gives the philosophy but doesn't give examples. I think this approach violates the following. I'd encourage you to get a better understanding of what these really mean in real world.. you'll know it instantly when you see beautiful code that follows the philosophy. Beautiful is better than ugly. Explicit is better than implicit. Simple is better than complex. Sparse is better than dense. Readability counts. There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it. (This is the main one you're violating, we have one if else pattern and it's obvious what it does) If you look at the opensource code from Google, Netflix, Facebook, etc you'll see really good examples of pythonic code. 
Are you enrolling in Georgia Tech and taking courses for college credit toward getting a degree? If so, it would be worth it. Otherwise a "Professional Certificate" is pretty worthless in my opinion. Recruiters won't care much about it. I haven't taken these courses so I can't tell you if these courses are good. 
I totally get your point... But how can you optimize the characters by following the principles that you mentioned. If you write if elif else loop in the normal way it is meant to be written (which I did in the first implementation) you will obviously have more characters than the short hand notation. Also it wasn't like I implemented the short notation out of the blue... Before implementing it...I explained how it works. Also that wasn't my final implementation. I believe my final code is much more readable compared to the solution with the short hand notation of if else statement.
What would you suggest instead?
Thanks for your reply - A degree may be nice in the future, but I wouldn't be taking the course for it - more of a "I have a really solid base" and can work up from there. I don't know, perhaps a regular £10 course from Udemy will do the same thing.
I learned it by reading documentation &amp; examples and working on my own, therefore I can't suggest a course for you. I was answering the part of the question about the "accreditation" of the course. 
Probably nothing
Super cool, thanks!
I signed up too! I also am taking Jose Portillas course on udemy. The edx course is free(unless you want the accreditation) so why not? Personally, I struggle with learning this type of stuff since I have always been more of right brained type of person. So I need as much help as I can get. 
They're optimized out of the function and class execution, but the compiler still keeps them around for building functions.
What are the subject areas/topics that Google HashCode focuses on? Can you please specify the algorithms that one should focus on and some resources where one could practice for this contest? Can you also mention which language is most suitable/preferred for the contest?
What do you think about the Udemy course vs the edx course? Is one better than the other or are they both equally worth looking at?
Foundational? Come on. This is a hype "course" at best, a con at worst.
Xpath allows more complex queries. CSS is easier. We have regex and we also have "str in str". Bith have their uses.
Hi, I've been trying to get a process like this up and running for a while. Any suggestions on some reading or documentation I can check out that would help me with doing something similar?
I think the most used query language is CSS selectors. Why does it matter? Just use whatever's right for the job.
That log looks like a sinking man.
It was really a lot of research and trial and error kind of thing so I don’t have any formal documentation. It all boils down to how you choose to use tools that are available via Python and cloud. If your trying to do something likethis with on-prem it’s really going to be involved. I used openpyxl library (I could probably leverage pandas but it looked intimidating and probably a steeper learning curve) and S3 events. If I recall correctly, file_object create event, which allows you to trigger a lambda function. The lambda function is what contains the actual ETL code, which reads in 6-7 worksheets, normalizes data and then writes it to mysql/dynamodb. Quite honestly, with mysql 8, I no longer need dynamo for indexed json. You can extract json keys to virtual columns and index those like normal sql fields. Of course I’m kinda locked in to mysql but so I was with dynamodb. At any rate, that’s the gist of it. AWS has great documentation on lambda. As a matter of fact, Lambdas have become my go to tool on almost all projects. I’ve developed a small service for my developers to generate qrcodes and store them on S3. For that one I used AWS API gateway and...you guessedit... a lambda. No need to stand up a flask/djangi app and write rest api from scratch. https://openpyxl.readthedocs.io/en/stable/
I'm not in front of a computer rn. But you could try df['lwage'].map(lambda x: x ** 10)
Great game but only I can see is schore.
Yeah noticed as soon as I posted. Should be fixed for the actual version. 😔

Xpaths are bread and butter if you learn how to format basic ones. 
Thanks! Yeah it's super useful because you can build it however you want. My backup works super simply. Everytime the program is launched, it will simply take a copy (using shutil) of the sqlite database file to another directory, including a timestamp. This had one issue: Over time there will be endless amount of copies. What I did then was: Every time the program is closed, it will check all files in the backup directory and see how many files there are. If there's more than, let's say, 30 files, it will compare the timestamps and remove the oldest files until there's 30 files left. Not sure how elegant solution that is but for my first program, I'm happy with it so far.
If you want real time inside a game, then you most likely want to actually use a graphics API like opengl to draw it in. Ideally you'd use whatever graphics API the game uses I'd also say that python and real time are not a good fit. If you don't need it embedded in the game, you can do animated plots with bokeh https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/index.html I believe you can stream data updates using bokeh but again this is not realtime.
By event based, do you mean monitoring a log or some type of streaming data and perform some action based on said data?
Function, Class, and Module docstrings, yes. However *Variable* docstrings are optimized out, except in special cases. It's one of the few optimizations that the compiler does, because a literal hanging out somewhere in Python code *cannot* change its behavior. You can test this yourself if you wish. First have a.py: a = 5 And then a2.py a = 5 """Doc for variable""" Ans then a3.py """Doc for module""" a = 5 If you compile all three files (in anyway you wish, easiest is using `py_compile`), you will see that the variable docstring is optimized out (and the module docstring isn't). Yes, the bytecode of a.py and a2.py will be slightly different (in my case, specifically the upper half of a byte and a2 will append the bytes 0x0601 to the end of the file), but it is impossible for that to contain the information of that docstring. This will occur regardless of what docstring you write. Of course there are times where hanging literals won't be optimized out because they are secretly literal operational expressions but thats a rarity.
More something like an event based library structure. For example events such as *on_client_connected*, *on_data_received*, *on_data_sent* and *on_client_disconnected* which one could subscribe.
it is only accepting numbers instead of numbers. please rephrase?
You can export a playlist (File -&gt; Library -&gt; Export Playlist) and iTunes will save it as a plaintext file (.m3u I think)
Its only accepting numbers instead of numbers and words.
r/titlegore
Doesn’t matter. I’ve seen sites where both xpath and css are fully dynamic. Making choosing either trivial.
Should add, it depends on the site. It does matter in some circumstances depending on how the site was designed.
Wow 
Ohhhhh. You've piqued my interest. Mind sharing some of what you've done? Monday to Wednesday for me is pouring through reports and building pointless PPTs. Would love to automate some of this on my week off next week. 
df[‘hourlywage’] = 10**df[‘lwage’]
Thank you so much.
Thanks. And you used the text document to find the songs and download it to your USB?
Just whatever docs the API your using has. The beautiful soup docs are great.
Understood. Thanks!
I animate stuff using tkinter. I'm able to show a webcam, one frame at a time, using a combination of OpenCV2 and tkinter's canvas. I do it through PySimpleGUI but the underlying GUI framework is tkinter. [https://github.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI/blob/master/DemoPrograms/Demo\_OpenCV\_Webcam.py](https://github.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI/blob/master/DemoPrograms/Demo_OpenCV_Webcam.py) There is one that also animates a Matplotlib drawing [https://github.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI/blob/master/DemoPrograms/Demo\_Matplotlib\_Animated\_Scatter.py](https://github.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI/blob/master/DemoPrograms/Demo_Matplotlib_Animated_Scatter.py) The frame rates between these look significantly different to me. The OpenCV output is faster than the Matplotlib. I don't believe Matplotlib animations were meant to be high-speed animations. With OpenCV you can draw on the images, quickly. This YOLO machine learning demo is taking in video frames from your web camera, running it through the YOLO object detection algorithm and draws a rectangle around **and labels** objects then finally displays them.. all in real time at a decent frame rate. [https://github.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI/tree/master/YoloObjectDetection](https://github.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI/tree/master/YoloObjectDetection) Again, the underlying calls are tkinter. The PySimpleGUI package simply provides an alternate interface to tkinter widgets. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
Certificates, particularly from online courses like those, are not really worth your money. They won't help you get past any recruiter filters, and when you do progress to the technical folks, they'll give you problems to solve in your interviews rather than relying on anything in your resume.
Can you post the code? We might be able to figure what the issue is.
/r/learnpython
There’s a bug in the code when I get a match and then the it shuts down so I’m working on using if/else statements and Try/except statements to save them for later. 
Right, also, [here is the code](https://pastebin.com/sCKwrVU2) if you are interested. I wasn’t planning on sharing so it isn’t well cited or documented, but it should work. Also my car player has a quirk where it glitches if the folder has over 100 files in it so I start a new folder at 100 songs. 
This is actually pretty creative lol. Can you show us GitHub code?
name=input("Enter the name: ") age=int(input("Enter the age: ")) print("the name of the person is",name,"and age is",age)

You need raw_input() for strings, input() only takes numbers
That’s cool! How do you keep this constantly running on your system though? Does it auto run when the computer is turned on? Do you leave it running in the background? 
Thanks, that solves the issue in Terminal, but IDLE now gives me this message when i Run Module: Traceback (most recent call last) BameError: name ‘raw_input’ is not defined
There's not really a notion of "private" in python. Instead, the language assume we're all adults here. Many languages recommend using getters and setters for everything, so that if later you need to do some validation or whatever, you don't have to change the interface. In Python, we don't like doing that much work if it's not necessary, plus writing ``get_name()`` all over the place is not very Zen. Properties let you use the attributes directly, then if you need to add validation, or whatever, later, you do it with the property decorator. You just need to have a "members-only" attribute like ``_name``. The leading underscore is merely a convention that tells clients that this attribute is not meant to be used externally and could change without warning, but again, we're all adults here.
but I want to automate this!
Thank you, ncorbuk. Great video.
I'm pretty sure that's incorrect. The input() function does takes strings. [https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#input](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#input)
I never thought I'd see a problem python couldn't solve. Getting a date, might he one. This idea is not an exception. They will detect this server side, likely block your account and delete all if the "swipes".
This is what I love about python and what I find makes it so fluid to write.
I think the issue here is that you're trying to run a Python3 program with Python2. Try running your program in the terminal by typing: `python3 program-name` Also, to use the Python3 shell just type `python3` on the command line.
What do you mean?
https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/
I just tried typing into Terminal python3 file-name python3 Source Code 2.py python3 - Source Code 2.py Python3 All produced errors. Could you ELI5. I only started studying coding yesterday.
Right now I just have it scheduled using the Windows Task Scheduler, set up to run once a day, or as soon as the computer is turned on if it missed a scheduled run. The eventual plan is to put it on a virtual machine in the cloud. It doesn't need much power to run at all, so I should be able to rent something out for a few cents an hour. 
Ok, it is literally cool, but what if you don’t like the girl?
What's the success rate though? This seems like it's more likely to make people not take online dating seriously.
Tinder will probably detect that this a bot and shut the Account down
True, but hey it’s fun while it lasted lol
Lmao, how much have you made from this
When I was looking for a job I wrote a script that would download job opening from an RSS feeds from various job sites giving me one interface to multiple services. Then I would classify the jobs I was interested in. As I ranked the jobs it would compare and identify key words for desirable vs un-desirable jobs. The next step was to start ranking jobs based on both the desired and undesired keywords so I could spend more time on jobs more likely to interest me. I found a job before applying the filter, but it was always interesting to see the ranking of the top desirable keywords and top undesirable key words. 
I made a script that runs as a service and listens for data on a particular port. When it gets a packet with the right data it fires up my virtual server and sends me a message via Telegram to let me know it's done so. It means wherever I am, I can use a packet sender on my phone to turn on a Hyper V Server. It's pretty rewarding and was actually fairly straight forward to do! (Although I did have to call a powershell script to turn the server on...)
PIL module is a good place to start or ffmpeg is good also for something outside of python. 
I am certainly one of those people. This is more something I did for fun. I work on app development and I been putting all my time and focus for developing for this start up. So I thought to make something on the side to get my mind off if lol. And I have a pretty interesting profile. I don’t know how many swipes it took but between tinder and bumble I got around 12 matches
Do you mind sharing the code? I am actually intrigued by your process.
This now-classic warning should be read by anyone who is thinking of getting gung-ho with regex and html. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1732348/regex-match-open-tags-except-xhtml-self-contained-tags
I just won’t reply or say I’m not interested lol. Depends on how conversation goes. 😂 
xpath is more general, it was designed for general xml. css was designed specially to html. It works conveniently with common html attributes like "class". css is shorter for most common queries and easier to use.
It's hard to tell without knowing what your setup is, are you on mac, windows, or linux? Perhaps you don't have python3 installed, etc... what are you learning from? Whatever tutorial you're using should explain how to setup your environment. I'd recommend watching the following video for getting things setup properly: [https://youtu.be/YYXdXT2l-Gg](https://youtu.be/YYXdXT2l-Gg)
Can you post the errors? Also, if the filename contains spaces, you should wrap it in double quotes; try python3 "Source Code 2.py" 
Mac I have in stalled Python3.7.2 Learning Python 5th ed and Udemy Python Programmibg 3.4.2
Luckily, I'd never run into that bug. 
Downloaded the [Collection #1] torrent (https://www.tomshardware.com/news/collection-1-breach-cyber-security-hack-troy-hunt,38470.html) and am now currently writing a script to go through all the data with a regex for my emails. I finished a version of the script yesterday and it works, I'm just making the output prettier - Instead of just printing out the name of the file it's looking at, I've got it saying a percentage of completion and how many files is left, rewriting the line each time before showing the matches at the end. It's nothing special but's fun and helped me a lot. After that I'll carry on with Automate the Boring Stuff - Next stop is dealing with .pdfs!
So you've matched with 12 other bots. 
You're just right-swiping everyone? Here's an idea: 1) scrape a bunch of pictures of women off facebook, twitter, etc. 2) label them based on whether your would right swipe or not. 3) Use TensorFlow/ Keras to train a CNN to ID pretty ladies 4) Deploy CNN to add your discerning taste to your automated swiping 5) ??? 6) Profit (but really you won't because dating is expensive)
If they programmed the bots all the way to have an in-depth conversation and give me their phone numbers lol
Or you can just say that it is all just tricks of your bot and you don’t know what she is talking about 😅

Yeah do you have GitHub code OP? I might actually try to make this for a silly hobby project. Tensorflow is super fun to mess around with 
asyncio is in the standard library, so I would use it.
&gt; on_client_connected, on_data_received, on_data_sent and on_client_disconnected it is much cleaner to use async functions for this. Especially if you need to keep some state between events, per connection.
You could even transfer low layers from another model to cut down on the number of samples you would need in the training set.
How are you interfacing with the app? Does it just need to sleep for a second to let the match pop-up thing disappear?

What does it DO?
I was literally working on something like this earlier today haha. Please post source OP
The design of the website is inspired from Reddit. The website enables you to search and discuss on different bacterias, viruses, protozoans and fungus. The current version of the website is stable but it still requires some key functionality that it is missing. From: A developer (Johk3)
I wrote a web scraper to notify me when the new doughnut shop in town opened.....
Yeah I edit some parts like wait times, and my login info. But it waits 20seconds and refreshes the page twice and pulls my information from my Facebook to login. 
Hahaha😂
I did something similar once. Built a bot that would go through the Tinder recs, find the ones who had swiped right for me, and display those to me. Then could easily click a button to swipe back or not.
I started my internship 4 months ago. In the beginning, I'd use Excel for everything like most people in my department. As the time went by, I realized Excel was unnecessarily slow for the datasets we use [I'm working with demand forecasting, so we usually deal with big sales datasets]. Now I choose carefully the things I do on Excel (like automating some simple stuff 'visually' or using it when I'm working on something I need to share with other people), for everything else -- like you said -- Pandas is my best friend. 
Swiping right on everyone won’t give you good results. If you swipe right on an attractive person and they don’t swipe you back, your elo will go down and the app will try to match you with lower elo people. The trick is to swipe right on someone in your league who is likely to swipe you back. At least that’s how it works for Tinder based on an article I read once and personal experience.
Does it still work?
Insights &gt; Traffic
Not for sure, which is why I ended up deleting my post. It's on an old machine (didn't want to put that one on Github), so might have to go back and look at it again. It used the Tinder API that was reversed engineered.
I didn’t know that. I could make the bot more advanced to account for things like interest, age, pictures they have uploaded, etc.. Thanks for the info🙏
Just write a script to scrape a list of this sub's active users and PM it to each of them. 
Really the fundamental issue is the mentality that you'd want to produce terse code. Terse is only good when solving for complex.. if you apply terse to something simple like an if/else you're you're adding complexity not removing it. The pythonic way to do one liners/shorthand is through lambas, list comprehensions, map, reduce and iterators (there a more if you go beyond the standard library). But they can be abused if you use them to often or for complex statements. Think about it this way. If you have 50 lines in a function you should think about how to make it more terse and break it up. If you have 5-10 lines chances are you're just adding complexity if you try to optimize them for line and character count. That said I've often replaced 10 lines with a one line lambda after I've worked it out. That's good practice.. write it out get it working then refine it for readability and execution speed.

Yeah, that video helped a lot.
I’ll see if I can find it. It’s not polished in anyway since it was just for me and I had no plans to share it and it’s pretty simplistic. Although it did occur to me that it would be a good service to offer people looking for a job. The intent being, spend less time looking for appropriate jobs to apply for and more time getting your resume ready for them. I did find that certain key words were interesting. For example I’m clearly not interested in McDonalds. Although at the time they were pushing a bunch of jobs on various boards. Actually the hardest part was probably finding the various RSS feeds. Google at one point killed off their feed and then brought it back after out cry to a different path. 
Its one of the first things I did after finishing the book is google “what to automate with python” 😂😂
Easily done with Selenium. What are you using for this?
This! They very quickly realised men just press yes to them all and leave selection for women. Now that massively hurts you. As someone else mentioned. It's probably easier to just pay for the tier of service that notifies you when someone likes you.
That’s all that matters 
Useful tip! At my company, we added an Alembic wrapper which updates a file at a well known location with the latest ID of the revision, whenever you create a new revision. This creates a merge conflict (intentionally) whenever two devs create separate heads, and whoever is doing the merge is responsible for resolving the conflict by creating an alembic merge. 
Not really. It just comes from experience and knowledge. 1. Write code that just works. 2. Figure out how to make it shorter and more elegant. 3. Repeat step 2. The more you code and the more you know, the faster you find the best route. 
Just had my first child, and there are many people constantly asking for pictures (grandparents, aunts, uncles, etc), so I wrote a quick little script that reads emails from a CSV and sends them all a random picture from the Dropbox we keep them in. I used Windows scheduler to have it go off daily on an old laptop I keep running for things like this. It has reduced the “can I have a picture?” texts tremendously haha.
I am creating a programming blog with flask.
Show your profile. Based on reading the rest of your post history, I'm guessing your profile is not clever or interesting. 
😂 excuse me?
Great minds think alike.
Wouldn't you first need to follow as many people as possible?
I'll check back in end of next week.
My wife keeps asking me if the weather would be fine the next day, so I ran a cronjob on my Raspberry Pi where the script pulls next days forecast through an API and sends her an email first thing in the morning if the weather will be bad (rain, snow, high winds etc.) (Ok, I lied. It's actually in progress)
I would if I was starting a LinkedIn profile from scratch, but my account has a decent number of connections. Some people I know from college got into recruiting so my feed is pretty active. I have it run on a timer and I can check the attribute of the post to tell if I liked it already so I never unlike a post.

This has actually been done before - Bernie AI Tinder shut them down for obvious reasons.
How can you tell if you've seen a post before, even with a different title? This is really cool.
Link done broke
What did you use for the transcription?
what does most foundational mean?
Have you visited r/BlackPillScience yet
This must be a new low...
Thanks! Your approach sounds legit as well.
I second that 
you should do this with requests, no need to spin up a browser for this
Link works for me go to the first link then from there try going to about 
True, but I feel that’s a bit easier to detect. I did something similar when it came to lead gen for a client company

Currently we're using the Nuance Transcription Enterprise engine most. Before, we used SPRAAK, developed by a Belgian university (we weren't really happy about it but it was almost free). We want to use Google's SPEECH-TO-TEXT in the future as it's really good and fast, but still have to figure out how it fits in the privacy &amp; security requirements of our clients. 
THE PICTURE OF CODE IS ACTUALLY PYTHON WTF
I work for a couple professors at my University. They have large volumes of data but it is all predictable. Rather than dealing with it all manually, I auto-process it into an output file.
Thanks for reply - I've taken that on board and taken up a course on Udemy for a tenner.
I use Sphinx. It is possible to have docs link to other modules as well
Hi there, from the /r/Python mods. We have removed this post as it is not suited to the /r/Python subreddit proper, however it should be very appropriate for our sister subreddit /r/LearnPython or for the r/Python discord: https://discord.gg/3Abzge7.

I mean, if I were interested in dating, I’d probably be interested in dating someone who makes AI matchmaking bots for fun.
Definitely Sphinx. There are many plugins too, including sphinx-autodoc-typehints to automatically convert type annotations into linked references in your docs. 
Porting a shell script into python, a super crude HTTP client thingy, so I can use it on windows without having to install/activate some bash component. Funniest part, to clarify my mind, I ended up writing an interactive loop, a faux-repl, to walk the HTTP request sequence. I'm half step from competing with hylang.
xmllint accepts xpath, so much better than regex over strings for xml/html .. it's good to know xpath. nothing against css ..
isn't that ... simulating ?
Well the edx course doesn't start until the 22nd for me So i can't say. Jose Portilla course however, is pretty great. He doesn't sound boring at all, and he gives pretty good explanations. Also the advantage to Udemy is both jose and his assistant are on everyday at some point checking messages. I asked a question about 5 hours ago and got a response. There are of course plenty of others who can respond as well, just like here on reddit. Now, Jose's course doesn't teach the 'Computer Science' part of it but it does give you some projects to do, other than its practice exercises of course. Look I got the course for $11 on sale, and it's going for $13 currently. I don't have thousands of dollars to go back to school and while yea I could take a few courses for a couple hundred, my current schedule doesn't allow me to do it. So this course coupled with my own research is working for me, although it really comes down to self motivation. &amp;#x200B;
Did not expect dating advice in this subreddit .
Someone over on r/arduino recently solved this problem too.

I'm curious to know the answer on this one as well.
Yuck go away. 
How would you click with requests or send one for this?
I will most definitely try this out. I've always been a huge advocate for online privacy since the Cambridge Analytica scandal last year.
Well you would use the native python ways of doing that instead of anything in django. For instance your flow could be user clicks the button on the form -&gt; Django handles the POST -&gt; calls a method, gets the return of that method -&gt; passes back to results page when you are finished processing https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/ref/request-response/
I've used `requests_html` and it worked perfectly for a similar use case. It uses a headless version of chrome instead of selenium.
Wow, I’m really impressed by your code. It’s super easy to read and clean. I have just learned something about python, didn’t know how to use class_init properly before. I have to find another cool retro game and try to code it by myself, asteroid game looks awesome but now I would think too much about your code to not just copy your idea(I mean the structure of the game and the asteroid class). 
If I ONLY swiping the hot ones, I would never get a match.
this is some next level horniness
BEST COMMENT EVER! 😂😂
What about the ugly ones? 
I changed the code up so it doesn’t always swipe right, but swipes based on my match making preferences. At first I had to leave them on read I’m sorry 😂
I would imagine that for side hustle you could just automate things for people. Start by doing it for a friend/relative in whatever office setting they're in and build them something that saves them time. Let that reference lead to paying opportunities. In all reality your using python to make your life easier now, so just you're really just selling that same concept to others.
If there is any feature that you would like to see added to TensorImage, or there is anything wrong or that can be improved, please tell us.
Yeah for sure. I have two files... A list of projects and a list of IT change request. I do some manipulation in pandas to filter out some results and change some formatting. Then, using our corporate template I create slides for each. Using loops and pandas groupings, I create one slide per system. All changes for that system are on one single slide in a table. I even created one slide that shows a summary of changes per system (similar to an excel pivot table) that has a bar chart that that's too automatically generated. Happy to help more if you have any additional questions. :) 
Sphinx is wonderful. The only thing that sucks about it is (at least IMO) the way it actually generates docs from docstrings is complicated. There are a few minor issues with it. As an example * undoc-members for autodoc isn't respected at the module level * [slots are fucked in a variety of ways](https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/issues/4678) * if two intersphinx items have the same item names, there's no way to force a reference to a specific one * there's no easy way to modify/fix sphinx inventories/guide the referencing heuristic. For example if you shadow a built-in (either intentionally or because it was added as a builtin after you wrote your code), then it may always point to the built in rather than your code. The same goes visa versa, because you can't guide the heuristic. Then you think "okay, I'll be explicit" and do something like ":func:\`\_\_builtin\_\_.str\`" (for Py2, or ":class:`builtins.str`" for Py3), but guess what, Python didn't document the built-in functions as under that module, so Sphinx won't ever find them. You have to literally go and fetch the inventory file using `sphinx.ext.intersphinx.fetch_inventory`, giving it a fake app and config object. And then modify that dictionary and re-save the inventory locally. If you can't tell that last point especially annoys me. Everything but the last I wanted to try my hand at personally, but I couldn't understand the complex circles they use to justify references.
Do you use a Python module for forecasting by any chance? 
the client communicates to the server via network requests. 1 simple way to do this is to open the app in question, open developer tools, go to network tab, and perform some action. you will see the network request go out. most of this is going to be an XHR- chrome offers you an easy option to replay it. also, it has a nice option to copy as a curl command for use elsewhere. its a nice way to learn about requests. most web apps are fairly simple and have reasonable restful APIs. 
That's really good to hear – I try to make things as clear as possible as I often pick up and drop projects over time. Although I'm using a class method for init_class (which I do have to manually call, it's not a magic dunder method), I am using the name of the classes directly a lot to access the class variables (e.g., Asteroid.asteroids) This isn't great practice in general I guess as it means everything breaks if I sub-class the class, but that isn't going to happen in this case. I guess what I should be doing is creating an Asteroid factory class which creates the individual asteroids, but abusing the class variables seems to work for this. u/yawpitch had some ideas over on the post over on the [pyxel](https://www.reddit.com/r/pyxel/comments/ahship/asteroids_pyxel_game_timbledumasteroids_on_github/eehnymv) subreddit, like lunar lander.
What you want is two different things. * 1st is to ping that IP in a certain interval. * 2nd is to setup a web app to show the status whats the difference ? For the first thing you can just write a python program to ping the ip. Your program just runs an stores the result somewhere (a database, a file, just in memory..) The web app just reacts on requests coming over HTTP (either a browser or any other program request (python requests module for example)). So you can realize that in two ways: * 1st a standard web app where the status only refreshes when you refresh the page. * 2nd a long polling app where your web app frontend (javascript/AJAX) calls the server to ask for updates. You have a use case that mixes some techs. You need a python program to check the IP regularly. You need to store the status somewhere (db, file, whatever). You also need a webapp that queries the status, for what you asked for you need AJAX as well. Long polling is another keyword here. But these are rather complex concepts so I would recommend: * python program to ping the IP * Website that show the status on reload/refresh You can realize this with any python framework out there. &amp;#x200B;
You should write your logic in Python but do the encode &amp; edit in FFmpeg. Full disclosure, I work for a large media company. We actually do exactly this in python (the timecode and frame math and a lot of other business logic) and then do the encode and edit in various encoders depending on cost and time to be done. FFmpeg isn't the fastest, but it can do this. You might need to do the audio in two passes - meaning add in music track after you do the video and blue audio track.
Or just use an auto-mouse clicker
Optimal strategy in apps like Bumble/Tinder is to right swipe everyone....(assuming right swipes are free)
This is one of those deals where I was just fed up with something and wanted to take SOME action, however ineffective...and I accidentally learned a new fact/skill. "Image hashes" exist! You basically distill an image down to "essentials" (which vary by algorithm) and you get a short string. This is how reverse image searches work. I'm doing the same thing. Download every image posted, hash it, search the DB for matches and post a comment if I find some.
And tinder uses their own ML techniques to determine attractive users too

2.445 is not representable in IEEE754 floating point encoding, it's actually 2.444999999999999840127884453977458178997039794921875. https://floating-point-gui.de/
https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#round Python rounds to even, not rounds up.
Please don't post screen shots when you can copy and paste the code and output text. Some Python developers are blind or visually impaired and screen shots are difficult for them, screen shots cannot be indexed by Google, and we cannot copy and paste code from screen shots. The reason is that 2.445 is a **binary** float, not decimal. So although it is printed as "2.445" the actual value is a tiny bit smaller than 2.445: py&gt; from fractions import Fraction py&gt; 2.445 &lt; Fraction(2445, 1000) True The exact answer is a 53-bit base 2 number: py&gt; Fraction(2.445) Fraction(5505650544460431, 2251799813685248) or in decimal: py&gt; from decimal import Decimal py&gt; Decimal(2.445) Decimal('2.444999999999999840127884453977458178997039794921875') which being less than 2.445 rounds down to 2.44.

You can try looking up those key words on github and see if the projects interest you. Or gitlab, I think that was the other one.

Write your own automated trading bot, and give it $100 to play with, and watch the money roll in. https://www.oreilly.com/learning/algorithmic-trading-in-less-than-100-lines-of-python-code (I’m kidding - don’t actually do this unless you’re willing to lose every cent you put into it. It is good coding practice though, and there are “fake” markets you can test your algorithms against)
I have a menu scripts which ease the user to choose what they want to do. Once they choose it will redirect to respective script. 
That's way harder than just using Selenium.
Upvoting for the parenthetical. Someone is already doing all the easy automated trading stuff, so there's no money to be made there.

From a blog-formatting perspective, it would be nice if the example code could be copied and pasted. The broadcasting expression that is said to give the outer product by adding the two arrays does not produce the outer product (such as from `np.outer`).

if you already know how to do it, no. plus requests can scale much better (until they ban you) compared to 1 browser per user. its a different approach that is more efficient in many ways, and while it may not be ideal for everything- understanding this approach is very beneficial. 
Fortunately, as long as anyone actually tests their trading algorithms for a few months before using real money, they’ll pretty quickly realize it’s not a get rich quick option... it’s still pretty good coding practice though, and if you’re careful and conservative, you can actually make a profit... just don’t expect it to be a ton, or fast.

Thanks for asking this question. The answer to it is we did not use a framework we used only CSS. Along with HTML and JavaScript and TypeScript to make the website. 
You can create content on Instagram, blog and YouTube. In the long while, you can monetize. Please start first by producing valuable content for the python community. 
I made a tasker app to swipe right on tinder. It had dialog features to change the swipe speed(slow would make it so that its just slow enough to avoid the 12 hour ban once you reached 2,000 swipes), change how many times it swipes when it starts(to avoid the 2,000 limit when on fast mode), and it showed a counter for how many times it swiped. I was pretty proud of myself putting that amount of logical effort into tasker without programming lol. I did use quite a few variables of course.
A nice project can be using some tensorflow for machine learning purposes and trying to do some stock analysis. Or honestly any project with tensorflow is super nice for a portfolio. 
We used scss as well. (Johk3) Developer.
I started by teaching myself as much as I could online. Pretty soon I reached a point where it was be more efficient to go back to school and really focus on what I wanted to learn. I caught up on my multivariate calculus and linear algebra skills and enrolled in a master's program studying statistics with good computing resources.
Nice vid.. I never thought to dive in on this topic. 😁 As a note to others this is a great demo of how lru cache works., When you want to use lru in a project, you'll should use lru_cache from the standard library. https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#functools.lru_cache As a note.. about clarity. You mumble at times, I'd suggest slowing down a little and enunciate you words.
Did you do your master's full-time? How long did it take to finish it? Thanks, mate.
SQLite4 is basically a dead project. I wouldn't use it for, well, anything. What's your end goal? 
I wish I was skilled enough to use Tensorflow lol. I don't know jack all about math, know little about the technicalities of AI, and I'm fairly novice to Python. I've made a few somewhat simple reddit bots/data collectors and have done basic stuff but that's about it.

And yes i found it a very interesting subject hence why i wanted to make a tutorial and share! :) I'm actually going to be creating tutorial videos EVERYDAY so if the stuff I'm teaching/content I'm making, i guess what I'm saying is stay tuned and subscribe for a lot more content in the future - I'll be creating a keylogging video tmoz, beginner easy one and a more advanced keylogger. Also if there is anything you would like to learn/ me to do a tutorial on let me know, and ill make it happen :) and like i said i really appreciate your feedback :) &amp;#x200B; Thanks. 
OP is using 2.7, where input() is equivalent to py3 eval(input()).

I haven't heard of any. Even if they did the impact would be tiny. A programming language can't tell when your code needs to be run in order and when not so it could only be applied to built in functions. Anything else would still need to be specified.

I found my wife that way 🤪❤️
While I agree with you generally. The saturation depends on the size of the market. Some success for the easy strategies can be found in small undeveloped markets as long as the initial investment is small enough to not fluctuate the price too drastically.
Yeah full time. About two years and an internship in the summer. I was working in finance before and was good about saving. Plus I was ready for something new. There are good part time programs too, though. 
Don't do this. If things are so god damn sensitive to have online, then don't post them in the first place. 
I made a weather app, a podcast catcher/downloader and a small CLI for talking to multiple API's when I started out, those were fun things to build and you learn allot :) 
On tinder yeah but not on bumble
Thanks for your insight - I picked up one of his courses on Udemy and started working through it last night.
I actually looked into something like this, found a free weather API. What modules did you use? I was thinking about setting the weather data in a graph (networkx) and then send to whatsapp
No, and it wouldn't really make sense to do so. The interpreter's job is to run the code you provide it... if you provide it code that employs multiple cores then you get multiple cores, but if you provide it code that _doesn't_ employ multiple cores then you shouldn't get multiple cores. In other words the interpreters job is to do what you tell it to do. Few tasks are automatically embarrassingly parallel and perfectly recognizable as such, and it's up to the programmer to recognize them.
The reason your not getting a match is because your as ugly as fuck. 
I accept that fact long long time ago.
I've gone down this line, but instead of trading I am scraping inplay stats of football matches from a popular betting site, if it hits the criteria's I've specified it places a bet. Currently still in the log to a database and don't actually place the bets as my dataset is far too small but since I put my final round of criteria in last week these are the stats: Date | Bets | Wins | PercentWin | Winnings ---|---|----|----|---- 2019-01-16|4|2|50.00%|39.50 2019-01-17|2|2|100.00%|43.27 2019-01-18|1|1|100.00%|16.67 2019-01-19|11|7|63.64%|111.27 2019-01-20|3|2|66.67%|44.75 Based off £10 stakes

Still learning. This week, I just want to master text manipulation and regex.
Looks to me that it means press Ctrl, then press Ctrl again.
Actually, I've just checked in "Manage Shortcuts", and I can't even find the "Run Anything" action. Maybe they meant Run what's at cursor, but that's a different shortcut in all keymaps.
that's great! Thank you and keep up the good work

Care to share your code? I was literally thinking of building this exact thing today for fun
You've probably already come across this but tools like debuggex can be a massive help with regex
Sorry if I’m not understanding right, don’t you just need to find the two largest numbers?
No, I have not. Thank you for sharing. Looking it up now.
First off if you are just starting to learn programming you really should not be thinking about becoming a contractor any time soon. You need to develop your skills first. Second the sad reality with programming as a side job is that you are effectively working for many bosses (your customers). It isn’t like being an artist where you do what you want , hang it in a shop and hope that it sells. Most of the part time work programming involves full time support. In a sense if you will not be around to keep the software running businesses will not want to do deals with you. Beyond working with businesses there isn’t a lot call for income making programming. When was the last time some one you know purchased a beautiful piece of code just because it inspired them in some way. Compare this with being a blacksmith for example selling stuff on Etsy or other art related web sites. About your only potential here is games offered through an app service and Python is the wrong language for this niche. You might be better off using self produced code to develop your own business opportunities that are not directly related to programming. That is your programming skills are used to create unique items that can be sold, or to automate business tasks. In many cases business automation is already a done deal so you are wasting your time there. I think more towards concepts where you customize a product via a Python program that might be produced on a CNC router. 
That is literally where I got that tool from haha happy coding my dude
It is a down market with the advent of so many Democrats winning in the last election. As such it will be years before anybody is making big bucks in the market.

Make Tinder, but for bronies. Make Deviant Art, but for blind people. Make Facebook, but for bee keepers... Basically just ~~steal~~ get inspired by a website/program/game, and then make it for a really specific group of people/subculture. If you get good enough at making stuff, and pretty lucky, your niche product will become the default product for that group, and then you will be independently wealthy. Most businesses fail within a couple of years though, so if you do get some money save it.
The problem here is that many businesses want to do deals with others they can depend on. Working with a programmer looking for side hustles really is not a comfortable thing as they aren’t sure if the guy can be depended upon a year (or a day) down the road to fix an issue or expand functionality. That is a mouthful but you almost have to setup your own business to be taken seriously. Running a business is far more involved than a side hustle. This is especially so with programming where most of your customers will be available 9-5. By the way I do know of the sites that I’d out jobs to programmers online. That might be a place to pick up work but I’ve never really have gotten down with that sort of modern “day working”. 
maxsum=0 sum=0 for i in list: if(i&lt;0 and sum&gt;maxsum): maxsum=sum sum+=i if(sum&lt;0): sum=0 print(max(sum, maxsum)) I guess this should work, i did not run this.
I’ve never understood the reluctance of people to find a job and you know actually work through school. Even a bit of part time work for four years can make a dramatic impact on all the expenses onehas upon leaving college.

Let's go, I'm ready to never see python2 again. I broke compatibility about a year ago and I'm glad now. Oh and python3.7 has ordered dicts by default . 
I did something similar with Tasker for android. In my area, mostly everyone swipes right: by the time I figured that out, I had already spent way too much time looking at profiles of people, with whom I would have never had a conversation because they would have never replied. One day I figured I don't really need to do that, because I can make a bot swipe for me, and make it look like it's a human doing that. So I end up just spending time to say hi to people that won't really reply to me, but I can live with that... For now..

Hi! JetBrains employee here. Thank you so much for helping us catch that! This is a feature that is available in some of our other IDEs, but not currently in PyCharm. We'll update our documentation to fix this.
Same, i am almost free for about a month,i want to learn python but i don't know anything where should i start. I have learned some basics, i want to start again.
You have to be kidding right? If your so called professor hasn’t covered this already but yet has asked you to write a “lighting console” (whatever that is) he shouldn’t be teaching. We are talking very basic program flow control here. 
wxPython is a really good GUI library, but it has a steep learning curve compared to tkinter. I've been trying to learn it but I don't really have the free time, but if you do then you definitely should.
Just adhere to rule #1 and rule #2
I already have a job. I want more money without more job.
I’m with you. When I first learned to code (back in 2011), I used Python 3 at first (thinking 3 is better than 2!) until I realized that nothing was available in 3. So I had to switch to 2 and felt it was a downgrade. Let’s just be done with this switch already.
Pycharm is pretty good. Was using sublime, but this a bit better. Using the commercial version. 
Requests simply receives the initial response and returns that to the user. Selenium renders the response in the browser and allows you to interact with the DOM. This is important when the web page has JavaScript on it and elements don't load initially. In this case Selenium can setup wait loops to ensure elements are loaded. Further Selenium can perform user actions like clicks and drive the browser via code. My general rule: use requests for interacting with APIs, use selenium for interacting with websites

In cases when opened web-page loads some data with Javascript, you will not be able to get this data using requests, because you need to run Javascript somehow. Selenium is like browser, so it runs this javascript and you can get this dynamically loaded data
This is my first publicly released python project after teaching myself python from many online resources. Currently the scripts scrapes data from the web however we have changed this to use the undocumented Ubisoft API on another project, so I may come back at some point implement that here too. &amp;#x200B; Let me know if there are any questions or suggestions for improving it!
Thank you for the answer. Is there a difference in the HTTP requests on the webserver or is it the same?
Same
Ok. When I make a HTTP request to a webserver X, X makes no difference in response while using requests or selenium? 
No, it's really about how you the programmer want to interact. Are you interacting with an API? then use requests Are you trying to test a web page or extract data from a web page? then use selenium Requests is bare bones HTTP library for creating web requests. Selenium is a higher level library designed for interacting with web pages via a browser.
F. Strings.
Thank you for so many details. you solved my question.

I do like the concept of showing the underlying principles in the functions of the code library. There's a lot of great stuff there that I've never even begun to think about using (3 years later as a pythonist) I think it would be especially useful for those who didn't take compsci. One thing I'd suggest, tie the work back to solving a real world problem if you can. To many python videos are just recreations of academic challenges which you would never use in the real world. It would also be good if you showed the principal but also the right way to do it as. Here's if you wrote it yourself and here's how to do it using the function. Best of luck and thanks! 
Thanks for the book, I just downloaded it
It depends on the type of business. Approaching small businesses as opposed to corporations gives you way more of a chance. Especially if you approach a business in a field you're familiar with you can usually get in with industry knowledge rather than a portfolio of programming success. Being in the healthcare field I've approached practice managers of doctors offices with some automations and found most fairly receptive because I know what types of issues they face and can describe exactly how much time it will save them. 
I was shocked the other day to realize that Redhat still doesn't include a python3 package as part of the standard distribution.

Small tip, consider creating a new directory maybe named with a timestamp like _r-wallpapers-2018-01-2018_ because it's always dangerous to delete files in a directory, especially without confirming with the user. Otherwise, great work - keep practicing.
Send a suitable cheque to the Python Software Foundation and I'm sure that somebody will step up owing to the urgency of the situation.

dataclasses are definitely challenging for that. I love them. 
Wow! Looks great on first glance! I've been looking into the Clean Architecture in Python lately but I had a hard time finding good literature. I will definitely give your book a thorough look. Thank you very much! 
Type hinting is something I really want right now for every codebase I'm involved with. Knowing what you are sending to methods and your editor complaining about you being an idiot is great.

I've only read a few bits and pieces so far, but there's a couple of things I think should be improved. TDD is not limited to unit testing. In fact Growing Object Oriented Software Guided by Tests suggests starting with acceptance tests. Test names could be more descriptive. A test name should tell me what the state of the system is, what's being executed and what the expected result is. I saw something like `test_avg_mass` which really isn't helpful. It's usually the convention to call the tested component `sut` for system under test. I think you don't emphasize the 3 step cycle of TDD enough, they're thrown in somewhere in between your coding examples when they should have been explained at the beginning. Especially refactoring. From what I've seen it doesn't really become clear that you should do it after every test if needed. Mock != Test Double I just saw a chapter named mocks, but I think it is important to understand the different responsibilities of test doubles. Using a Dummy in a test tells the reader that we don't expect relevant interaction with that component. A Stub tells them we require a value from it. A Spy means we expect a method to be called. Mocks are the last and most "powerful" in this hierarchy since they can verify things by themselves.
I'll give this a shot right after I finish porting everything to tkinter to try it first! Thanks! The game engine isn't an issue. The game is [iRacing](https://www.iracing.com/), and I'm just pulling data from it's SDK. It writes the values for lateral/longitudinal G's to a memory address, and there's [already a python interface](http://members.iracing.com/jforum/posts/list/3232429.page) to pull those values (along with about a hundred other ones that I'm not using) into my program. That all works at ~60hz. So i'd like to be able to update at *at least* 60hz. Once I can get my random data working at a reasonable real-time speed, then I'll introduce the actual live data. Once that works, I plan to use a program called ["OVRDrop"](https://store.steampowered.com/app/586210/OVRdrop/) to overlay my python program into the cockpit, while I'm in VR. But first, I've gotta get it drawing in relative real-time. Thanks everyone for the help! I've got a few options to explore now!
I haven't seen anything with as much stuff for Django/Pyramid development as PyCharm and am staying for the foreseeable future.
Job interview questions to ask: - What language is your codebase in?
Are you maybe looking for double shift?
Seriously, using the documentation it could take maximum 1 or 2 hours for a beginner, it just ask you to create methods and do some math. 
The lack of tensorflow-gpu support for Python 3.7 has made that unusable for me currently. Hoping for a patch soon, because those look very usable. 
Those outdated examples are still valid because the API never changed.

Why do I need to give you my email address to read this "free" book?
Thanks for the comment, I'll think about it. Keep in mind that the book is intended to be an introduction for beginners and not a full essay on TDD, so some things are purposefully kept simple. As for the 3 steps of TDD I don't really understand when you say that I don't emphasise them enough. The first project is a learn-by-doing introduction to TDD and follows them in a very strict way. I've been criticised by some because I've been too pedantic and strict there! While I understand what you say about doubles, I don't understand what you are referring to, as I don't name them anywhere. Can you please clarify? Thanks!
That's amazing. I'm running out of cash right now but as soon as I get my paycheck I'm tipping you something. My girlfriend is getting into Developpement and this is exactly what she needs to avoid bad practices 
LeanPub requires the user to give the email address to record the purchase. As you can see, I'm using that platform and not hosting the book on my own, as using the LeanPub engine saved me hours of work. Why do you put the word free between quotes? The book is completely free, so far 3,186 readers downloaded it without paying anything and you can also have access to the source files on GitHub.
Because if I have to give up my privacy, it is no longer free. I have traded my email address, which has value, for this digital good. I would be happy to host the book for you at no cost. Then people would not have to share their email address. 
Glad to know that it is helpful. Don't worry about the money, enjoy the book and spread the knowledge ;)
I see your point. I'm sorry that this is a problem for you. I might obviously host the book on my blog but hosting it on LeanPub allows readers to support me with money if they want. As I incur expenses publishing it, that is appreciated. You can however find the sources of the book at [https://github.com/pycabook](https://github.com/pycabook)
If you're not willing to learn you'll keep on failing. Don't fail! Use this: https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/python3/ To write this... x = input('input something: ') print(x * 2) It's completely the wrong sub for this anyway. You should be in r/whelks.
&gt; allows readers to support me with money if they want. Ah, so it is free, but this would allow people to make donations? That makes sense. It is your book and your decision, I can only give you my opinion. But anytime I see "free" and then I see "just enter your email here" I am immediately headed the other direction. Just my two cents.

I "bought" it now. Thanks. 
eather way, i'm doing it in python &amp;#x200B; why? &amp;#x200B; BECAUSE I CAN!!!
Have you even tried? You can learn that in a couple of hours if you want. Stay up the night if you have to. At least try to do it. I'd rather try and get an F than cheat and never learn it.
Step one: don't do TDD. Step two: there is no step two, you have clean code.
Thank you for reading it
I’ll try I guess, but personally I’d rather cheat, get the A, then learn it.
Lunar lander seems awesome! Thanks for idea! I have read about different OOP frameworks/patterns like factory but haven’t understand its potential to be honest, I must try to understand it and write one by myself in python. 
If you find tkinter or WxPython confusing to program or find it wordy, take a look at [PySimpleGUI](http://www.PySimpleGUI.org). You can knock out programs quickly and simply. Get the same layout using the same underlying widgets, but presented in a different way. The amount of code required for the same feature is significantly smaller than using tkinter or Qt. It's meant to free you up to focus on the program's purpose rather than the program's GUI.
This isn't exactly the whole picture. JS can't ask the server for any data that python couldn't ask the server for. It's just that sometimes it's too much work to figure out how to structure your requests in python, so it's just easiest to use a browser. Of course opening a whole browser is sometimes just too resource-intensive...then you've got to do the tedious work of reverse engineering the page so you can build your own request with python. 
Seems like everyone likes this very much! I just bought two books on TDD and Clean Architecture, but the examples are in Java. Was wondering if there was anything based in Python, and my prayers have been answered! Purchased.
I don't think you will every actually learn it with that attitude
You say that like it's a bad thing.
Thanks!
&gt; I’d rather cheat, get the A, then learn it Lol that's a losing recipe in life. 
You can use them in Python3.6 if you install them with pip: pip install dataclasses from dataclasses import dataclass
Congrats on writing a book. That is always exciting! Alexey is a busy guy. He is also translating my book, Python 101, although I haven't seen a lot of progress the past couple of months. I've been using Leanpub for a couple of years now, so if you have any questions about it, let me know.
Well I was under the impression that they were looking to change by the middle of next year they didn't change but I basically held a gun to their head and forced them to allow us to use Python3 instead and ported it myself.
This video: [https://youtu.be/Q5SyV8KPwbw](https://youtu.be/Q5SyV8KPwbw) I took the Ultima-Thule approach animation, remapped the highest resolution image to one of the previous frames in the video, and then interpolated between them to get a 3d "stereo" effect. &amp;#x200B; You can see here [https://i.imgur.com/lgVKKuJ.png](https://i.imgur.com/lgVKKuJ.png) how the details from the (until now) highest resolution image are mapped to the (approximately) correct position in the previous frame. There are some artifacts from the processing, so this is not a 100% "real" render, but it's based on the original data and kept as close as posible to "ground truth". &amp;#x200B; I used Python, Numpy and OpenCV to do this.
While at least one of their gnome GUI tools is a Python 3 script that doesn't run. It's almost impressive how dumb it is.
Dude, no one is telling you to use your super-duper private email address. Use a throwaway one if you care that much. 
I agree with the rest naming. We use things like `test_avg_mass_ok`, `test_avg_mass_fails_with_non_numeric_input`, etc. I’ve never seen the `sut` convention. Pytest’s tracebacks usually give enough context that we rarely bother with adding extra context now.
Been programming in Python3 for the last 4-5 years. My 2 questions are: “Python 2 or 3?” and “Do you use MySQL”. After two weeks of trying to solve a trivial DISTINCT ON query in MySQL (MySQL does not know DISTINCT ON a specific field) I swore to myself that I’m not touching another project with that bloody excuse for a database. 
Michael, thanks! It means a lot to get encouragement from an accomplished author like you. Thanks for your offer, I will surely ask if I'm in need.

&amp;#x200B; If you want anti-aliased rendering, going faster than 20 FPS is challenging whatever. In this case, your best bet is the Qt 2d drawing API using it's OpenGL backend. If nice anti-aliasing / rendering quality is more important than raw speed (i.e. \~ 5-10 FPS is OK), a CPU rendered graph is best. Matplotlib doesn't do enough caching to be efficient. Matplotlib wasn't designed for real-time rendering. However, it's core 2d graphics rendering core is actually pretty fast (Antigrain anti-aliased drawing). Chaco is much faster for real-time updates (also uses Antigrain rendering engine) because the authors optimised the caching for this purpose but it's dependencies can be a PITA. Unless you actually want it to look like a scientific chart, you're probably better of drawing the chart yourself. Cairo is a nice platform-neutral drawing API. Also, wxPython 2d Graphics Canvas drawing API would also work (it uses cairo under the hood). Surprisingly, the old DC (Drawing Canvas, GDI+ / xlib based) drawing backend for wxPython is blindingly fast (but looks ugly as there's no antialiasing). Overall, just use Qt and pick whichever backend (software-rendered vs hardware rendered) works best on your platform.
TDD is not a tool for "clean code", but for more reliable code. Also OP wrote about a clean architecture, which may still have not clean code.
Found this book a couple days ago and it's great! Especially the flask project at the end. You explained to me in simple terms what other blog posts I read explained in cryptic terms. It would be great if you can do a similar tutorial for Django (Although I will try it myself first xD)
TDD starts at defining a clean API. Then it gets into need a feature, make a test. It’s about both clean code and reliability.
Thank you! I used to work with Django some years ago, I remember studying class-based views in depth. Now however it's probably a completely different framework. If I start working with Django again in the future, I will surely write something on it
Didn't know about your book. Better late than never. I'd add it to my list of books to read, I'm mainly a java developer and this could be a good training for my python skills (which I use in my free time)
Thanks you!
Does MariaDB support that option? 
I *think* all major python web frameworks are blocking. Sites using python web frameworks scale at one layer up...namely the web server (gunicorn for example...usually behind nginx) runs a copy of your web app for each request. Also, off the top of my head, the major python web frameworks are conceptually the same. In fact, with what's probably the biggest two (flask and django), you can write your application in a manner that looks almost exactly the same. Flask is great and django is great, but I usually default to Django when I'm the one making the choice. With flask, as soon as you step outside of the basics, you have to depend on all the \`flask-\*\` packages to add more capabilities to your project. The problem with this is that the quality of these third-party packages is not very consistent. Django comes with a lot more in the box before you have to go to third-party packages. (Of course, not everything that Django comes with is of identical quality, but generally the quality is more consistent). Couple this with the fact that the big selling point of Flask, (being small/lightweight, is not actually something Django is bad at...it's just that Django docs and community is more focused on larger apps. You can write a small single file django webapp just like you can in Flask.
Last time I checked, no.
Is this it? https://www.techonthenet.com/mariadb/distinct.php
That’s not what I meant. So DISTINCT and DISTINCT ON are two different things. The behavior you described is DISTINCT. The DISTINCT ON returns the entire row, not only the specific field. Think at it as a GROUP BY based on the DISTINCT field. Here a somewhat good article on it: http://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-select-distinct/
I used to love Sublime Text but switched to VSCode. There lots of plugins that I can use on VSCode that makes me productive, it's so easy to customize and it's very performant.
&gt; this does not seem like a good route for a scalable web application, heavy on database queries, with a lot of concurrent users. in this case, the database will most likely be the bottleneck, not the application. Even if the application was the bottleneck, it is easy to scale it horizontally. It is much harder to scale the database.
Ahh ok, I haven't used it, was just wondering. I mostly use Postgres but was wondering if MariaDB was better maintained than the regular MySQL
Yea it is. However MySQL/MariaDB lag quite a lot behind Postgres when it comes to the feature set.
Thank you for the thorough and detailed response. I guess I might be getting confused on the "blocking" aspect of things. Perhaps there are some good article(s) that are current that you can recommend that explain why the "blocking" nature of frameworks such as flask and django isn't that big of a deal, because it seems like all the current articles are on the "async/await" hype train.

Thank you for your comment, but I am a bit confused by your intial statement. &gt; this does not seem like a good route for a scalable web application, heavy on database queries, with a lot of concurrent users. Isn't pretty much every *major* web application these days heavy on database queries and concurrent users? I am sure at least some of them are, and that some of them are using Python, so how are they doing it? I agree with the database being the bottleneck, and after working heavily in the cloud I do understand how to scale both horizontally and vertically. Thanks!
Well different styles of system really and different approaches for the same problem. Each database has their own merits and demerits, like I'd say postgres' biggest competitor isn't MySQL or whatever in terms of new users it's more like MongoDB.

Fully agree. PyCharm is the only IDE I know that really understands Django Templates and is able to reformat them (mostly) sensibly. The Pro edition is also the only IDE I know that can actually debug Django Templates. I looooove VS Code, but for Django, PyCharm is the way to go.

Sure except Postgres has JSONB which is exactly what Mongo offers. Anyway I won’t enter into polemics now.

Thank you for letting me know!
It is a big deal only when the connections have to wait opened for a relatively long time, like websocket connections or long polling requests. It is not a big deal when you wait only for SQL server queries, which is relatively fast, and the number of concurrent queries is limited anyway.

you dont have to use the orm in sqlalchemy, you can simply pass a string to a connection or engine object and deal with the results. However, using the orm has benefits in at the very least guards against sql injection. Since you already have a database and I'm assuming are not planning on changing that anytime soon, you might be interested to know that you can read the schema information from the database so you could have a list of all the table objects available to you at runtime, you could even generate models from those table objects at runtime as well if you want. Then you dont have to spend time writing your models at least not initially though long term you probably will want to. &amp;#x200B; in regards to asyncio, you may want to give this a read. [SqlAlchemy and Async](https://techspot.zzzeek.org/2015/02/15/asynchronous-python-and-databases/) &amp;#x200B; dont worry about the scalability due to blocking. your database is going to be the bottleneck and you can get around blocking by allocating a process pool using something like gunicorn. There's plenty of companies running real apps with real scalability challenges using these frameworks just fine. &amp;#x200B;
&gt; Isn't pretty much every major web application these days heavy on database queries and concurrent users? I think that the non-blocking frameworks became a thing for two reasons. When massively scalable nonsql databases became more widespread. And when web apps became using two-way communication, the server connections have to wait opened for a long time, this can be solved by a separate non-blocking server that serves only the websocket connections.
Good read .
He's saying there is not tensorflow-gpu for python3.7, so he can't get to 3.7, so he can't use dataclasses.
Lower-case T, test-driven development, is fine. Write code, test as you go. It’s not a magic bullet but it will _help_ prevent breaking changes as the application grows. Upper-case T, buzzword-laden Test Driven Development, where you write test cases to codify behavior before you ever write application code, is utterly insane. Don’t do it. The test suite is not an appropriate place to define your spec. 
Wow. This guy really hates people who are stuck on 2.x. 
good bot!
We yeah but
Looks neat I will check it out if I have time. Cool that it's built on tensorflow. Seems like a few nice examples on the website worth going through at least

thank! 
I don't know how I feel about your profile pic. 
Thanks for sharing! I've just been starting a small project to learn a new framework and try to improve my overall programming ability (including these topics) so it's perfect timing :)
I'm going to type "Django" below, but you can read it as "Flask" or whatever. In python, async frameworks can serve tens of thousands of requests per second per server. Django can serve thousands of requests per second per server. Because of this, async is likely a large part of the future for Django. However, *a single server is still able to serve **thousands of requests per second***. Unless you really, really know you *have* to have the ability to serve that many requests with as little resources as possible, it's not quite the right time to jump on the async train. Django has over a decade of work by hundreds of developers making it secure, easy to use, easy to scale, easy to troubleshoot. The same holds for other web frameworks.
A standard deployment set-up has a web-server like Nginx routing requests to n python processes, each of which is blocking, and handles one request at a time. You can scale this up basically indefinitely by adding more web-servers and python processes - the overhead is much higher than it might be for an async framework, so for really heavy traffic this might become expensive, but it's really not *that* expensive, and your traffic isn't heavy enough that you should worry about this. As others have said, the bottleneck is basically invariably the database, but that's the same problem as in every other framework.
I'm a newb to Django, but from what I've seen class-based views are still a very big part of the Django framework. From what I've gathered, Django has been expanded around the edges (and perhaps gotten a bit bloated) in order to cover new use cases that were never intended originally, but the core concepts and design are mostly the same as when it got started. 
Just use one of the countless anonymous email providers.
Thank you for saying this. As a new coder, I've been trying to wrap my head around how it might be at all logical (let alone "best practices") to write your tests before writing the actual code. It makes sense to have testing in mind as you write your code to smooth the process of writing effective tests, and even anticipating problems and writing cleaner code from the start... but writing tests first seems like buckling your belt before putting your pants because... belts are so great and awesome?

Thanks for reposting this, I was looking for the original post and couldn't find it because I mis-remembered the title and my search-fu was weak. I'm looking forward to digging into it.
I can't tell from the table of contents, but does it cover pytest?
Thanks for reading it
You are welcome, I hope it will help you
You are welcome, enjoy!
Thank you, it is good to know that people appreciate the effort and find it useful
You are welcome. Actually the original post was on Hacker News, this is probably the reason why you don't find it ;)
Yes all the examples are implemented using pytest
So I've been playing around with this script for the past few days. First time really modifying someone elses tool before, so that was neat. https://github.com/Spiteless/AdvCopyPaste.pyw I have no idea if the changes I made are 'better', but * Added additional command to preview all buffers (Super+ctrl+slash) * Changed buffering system from a list to a dictionary * Changed Paste system to load value buffer into clipboard and paste instead of using kb.write() * Moved hotkey declarations into a list that executes on init (not sure if this is materially better, but it allows them to be imported alongside other custom keyboard hotkeys) * **Moved msg() commands to subprocess.Popen using click** -- for some reason the script was failing when msg() was called, now it's not blocking on my system (Windows 10) Let me know what you think :)
It’s more of Javascript question. With pure JS you only can popup a print dialogue, and the user must do the final click. Full automatization requires some kind of plugin on the user's browser. 
Thanks will definitely check it out.

It's really sad that this is the reaction to this in r/python. I expected this audience to be a little more receptive to this. 
That’s a great idea, I’ll definitely try and implement that!
What a sad approach to sharing within the python community. 
Surprised no one mentioned [pyqtgraph](http://pyqtgraph.org). It is usually the graphing library that is recommended if speed is of concern.
I have a similar script for r/EarthPorn. It checks for top posts with a res of at least 1920x1920 (maybe want to use them somewhere else) and the tag OC (Original content) in the title. Then it uploads that to gdrive which with the help of IFTTT sets it as my Android background image. If someone wants to have it PM me.
Could you send it to me? I’d really like to see it.
Thanks, that's a great idea i did sort of try to do that when i showed memoization as its more simple and how this can optimize your code etc, but yes i should maybe go into it more. If you could give it a like and subscribe mate , You will be in for more great tutorials in the future, as am going to be doing them daily, if not every other day :) More interesting things to come :)
Great ! I'm currently working on a similar project using ML. I'm curious, what criteria are you using to take a decision ? 
I have heard a lot about gunicorn while researching this, but chasing all the different rabbits down their holes, I haven't focused on researching it as of yet, sounds like I need to take a serious look at using something like that. Based on my scenario do you see any major cons to using it, and is there anything else similar worth looking at for comparison? Additionally, you expanded on using SQLAlchemy as an ORM, would using an ORM also aid in transitioning to PostgreSQL down the line? Thanks for all your help!
For the record, this is the first time I've ever uploaded something I've written and had someone make changes to it. So that's pretty cool! I'm glad you like it :) Click is great, and honestly moving the message system over to another script shouldn't cause any problems; however, instead of calling the script from the command line using `subprocess` I would instead just import the function from the script like this: from alert import alert ... alert(details go here) # whenever you need to send an alert Changing the buffers from a list to a dict I can maybe understand, although tbh I'm not sure why you did? Can you elaborate why you did that? Adding in a command to view all the buffers is genius, and I like the way you used `pymsgbox` to do it; I had never heard of that before I need to check it out! My one REAL complaint (and its fairly minor) is that all of the helper files should have the extension .pyw, especially if you are going to run them with subprocess; the reason behind this, if you don't already know, is that using this file extension python knows to keep the program as headless, so there is no window. It is (very mildly) irritating from a user perspective when the command prompt window launches when I just want to see what is in my buffer. Again, more of a nitpick than a real complaint. As for moving the hotkeys to a list, that was something I had initially thought about adding, but ultimately ~~was too lazy~~ didn't. But I think it's a much better way than the same line changed a few times. And finally, removing `kb.write()` in favor of `kb.send("ctrl+v")` honestly doesn't seem to work on my machine; perhaps in a better world (one where I was willing to spend more time on this and making it more fully fledged out) that could be a setting that was easily changed. But if it works for you then it works for you! Just for fun, let me give you the actual backstory behind this script; I was working on a really large script that had a class I was making changes to. I needed to test a method within that class, but before I could just test it I needed to run some other methods before (it was a database management class, and so I needed to create a new database and fill it with testing data over and over again). Now for some reason when I'm in my IDE (VSCode) in the python command line the ability to use the up arrow to recycle previous commands didn't (and still doesn't) work, so I had to type the commands by hand each and every time I made a change. This obviously got very annoying to me and I decided I needed to automate it. Now while I could've just added it to my ifmain statement, I decided instead it would be more fun to write a script to be able to save multiple strings in a list and type them all sequentially. Maybe not the best solution to my problem, but definitely the more fun one. Just thought I'd share the story if you wanted to know :) Overall: I give your changes a solid 8.5/10. I don't agree with every decision made, and I think some minor things could be changed, but at the same time you did take the time to edit my tool, and even added features I hadn't thought of, and that is super dope!
TDD makes it easier to achieve clean code because you can continue to refactor your code (to make it cleaner) and still be assured that the behavior of your application hasn't changed.
r/learnpython
To be honest I was going to use my datasets to teach myself ML as it would give me the reason to really get into it. Currently its a mixture of attacks, dangerous attacks, shots on and off target and obviously some exits in red cards. I ran a data collection on all games and stats between 70-80 mins and ran a small regression (I think this is the right term) model to find out what combination of the stats would have given me the best too. That table I posted is the results of that model. 
Nice script, but I don't think you need PRAW to do this. A more efficient way would be to download and parse this JSON : [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallpaper/hot/.json](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallpapers/hot/.json) This would save you the trouble of using your reddit credentials too.
You should read Test Driven Development by Kent Beck. TDD made a lot of sense to me after I read that vs reading stackoverflow posts and a bunch of blogs that contradict each other. In TDD you - Think about the perfect interface for your class/application. - Write tests that test the expected behavior of your class/application. - Now actually code your class/application. - Once all your tests pass, you know everything works as expected. - You can now continually refactor your code and you'll know if everything is still working. Does any of this seem too difficult or unreasonable? Keep in mind that TDD is about testing behavior, not implementation. If you think it's about implementation then yeah TDD seems difficult.

Once you understand one language you can pick up the others fairly quickly. As far as zero to proficient in 10 or so days -- it is possible but it depends on the person. People are born with different levels of ability and motivation that has to be taken into account. Could you do it, i don't know you at all so i can't say if you can. Can someone with the correct motivation? Yes they could. If you want to start, start. If you learn it in 10 days you do. If you learn the basics in 5 days and then get stuck for a while then proceed to advance farther in 30 days that is also fine. I wouldn't put a time limit on it. You either will put in the effort to learn or you won't. I hope you do. 
Okay. What can I do to maximize the skills I accumulate per day of studying?
Great, thank you. I believe I have a mental issue because this has been confounding and bugging me way more than it should since I started using PyCharm. Amazing IDE btw, thank you for your work!
Sure, you can learn the very basics in a week. You can also learn the basics of playing the guitar in a week. Does that make you a great musician? Hell no, you will suck. Becoming a great musician or a great programmer takes years. Don't pay attention to time. Pay attention to understanding it thoroughly.
Not worth shouting about. 
I did
How?
I know a lot of different programming languages. Python has very easy grammar and share a lot of grammar to popular programming languages. Python has very good exception handling by itself. So whatever I ask them to do a lot of time it works. It also have a good community and code at github. 
Do actual practice. Write code, don't just read theory.
Actually write code. Do code katas, personal projects, contribute to open source projects, etc. We learn best by doing, so do you must.
Google. https://docs.python.org/3/download.html
I made a minimalist but complete email sending framework for Python. It basically takes all the hassle away from the built-in `smtp` and `email` libraries. Would be great if you could check it out, and if you like it, give it a star! Also, feedbacks, I need them :wink: https://github.com/SkullTech/drymail
When can you say you have "learned Python"? Like what do you want to do with it? What's your goal? Learning Python is different for everyone. Someone can say they "know Python" once they can code a simple program for themselves. For someone else it means they understand every single Python code they see. It's totally different for everyone. Figure out exactly what you want to do and shoot towards that.
What about [`sqlitedict`](https://github.com/RaRe-Technologies/sqlitedict)
It would be a good idea to share a working version of the code on GitHub. That way if the viewer hits a roadblock they can refer to your code as a reference... Good luck! 
&gt;Based on my scenario do you see any major cons to using it, nope, the general consensus is to use gunicorn or uwsgi to serve your python app with nginx in front of it in production. I can't think of any downside &amp;#x200B; \&gt; Additionally, you expanded on using SQLAlchemy as an ORM, would using an ORM also aid in transitioning to PostgreSQL down the line? &amp;#x200B; In theory and ideally yes. But in practice in my experience, changing databases is costly and error prone for production apps regardless of whether an orm is used. 
good idea! I did presume that because i was doing at a good pace.. and all code is explained well and correct that they could pause etc but yes i will add that to the description, thanks! :)
Thank you!

I'm a privacy advocate myself and understand the issues with providing personally identifying information. And advocate to others to weigh the costs of doing so. However, at the same time, OP has provided us a resource at zero monetary cost for us when surely it could be charged for. Presumably because of that he also choose to not setup potentially costly infrastructure to provide it and instead choose to use a known provider. The cost for me using leanpub is to provide my email (which I've chosen because I've purchased other items from there) or to use one of the countless anonymous email providers. Now, let's consider your offer of hosting the files yourself. I don't know you. You are not a trusted provider for me. I don't know if you'll sneak something in while serving the files. Downloading from your servers is a much more risky affair for me.
I wrote the same sort of thing as an addon in Kodi: [https://github.com/KODeKarnage/script.subreddit.wallpaper](https://github.com/KODeKarnage/script.subreddit.wallpaper) It requires installing two other modules though; [https://github.com/KODeKarnage/script.module.prawcore](https://github.com/KODeKarnage/script.module.prawcore) [https://github.com/KODeKarnage/script.module.praw](https://github.com/KODeKarnage/script.module.praw) You can set the desired image resolution, add other subreddits, and skip NSFW images. Also, it has a reserved spot for an image you can set as the Kodi background, that constantly gets overwritten with the latest new hot image. I actually forgot about it, just checked the target download folder and it has \~2,000 images!
Thank you brother I'll read this book within the next thirty days. 
Thank you very much!
Hi there, from the /r/Python mods. We have removed this post as it is not suited to the /r/Python subreddit proper, however it should be very appropriate for our sister subreddit /r/LearnPython or for the r/Python discord: https://discord.gg/3Abzge7. The reason for the removal is that /r/Python is dedicated to discussion of Python news, projects, uses and debates. It is not designed to act as Q&amp;A or FAQ board. The regular community is not a fan of "how do I..." questions, so you will not get the best responses over here. On /r/LearnPython the community and the r/Python discord are actively expecting questions and are looking to help. You can expect far more understanding, encouraging and insightful responses over there. **No matter what level of question you have, if you are looking for help with Python, you should get good answers**. Make sure to check out the rules for both places. Warm regards, and best of luck with your Pythoneering!
Was just checking out the GitHub repo for this book, what did you use to publish the e-pub / PDF format? I'm impressed with how well the markdown turns into a well formatted book.
I like TDD. The first time that I read about it, I didn't make sense of it. But after some learning, kinda makes sense. It's kind of hard to adopt, but is good.
I'd recommend using asyncio streams [1] instead of `asyncio.Protocol`. The latter is a low-level concept that should only be used when maximum performance is desired. When using streams, asyncio (on the surface) isn't that different from curio and trio. [1] https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-stream.html
Use `with open(...) as f` and `f.readline()` and write to disk with pickle after reading 1M lines or so into a dataframe. You can then load those dataframes one by one and run your clean funcs. 
Yup you probably have to read it like by line. You may want to consider using `vaex` when your data is a readable csv.
Thank you for sharing and making it free! Adding it to my reading list, I've wanted to get better at TDD for a while now.
Most systems accomplish this via both a web server and a small "plug-in" installed on machines. When the webpage requests a print, your web server sends the command to the plug-in. This is exactly what Odoo does: https://www.odoo.com/apps/modules/8.0/base_report_to_printer/

Cool, man! I just wrote a script to delete Tweets by substring this past Sunday. I heard a lot about data loss from my friends, but honestly I think people get a little dramatic with that sometimes. 
If you want to do basic file converting or sorting, or maybe even stumbling your way through one library or task, I suppose. I was writing some simple crypto notification apps in about that time. Very simple shit, using requests to interface with binance API. They were pretty shit. I wouldn't say I learned python in that time. I'd say that I learned that couldn't learn python in that time.
You are welcome!
Thanks for reading my book mate ;)
You are very welcome!
This is the product of the Markua processor that Leanpub uses. It's basically a superset of Markdown with support for book-related features like footnotes and parts. The specification is still in process, but you can already read about it here [http://markua.com/](http://markua.com/), and obviously use it in Leanpub.
Thank you for reading it. Please share what you learn and let me know if you like the book
&gt; I would instead just import the function from the script like this: I don't know why, but when the msg() function timed out it was causing an error in the script on my system, so the reason why I had it called via subprocess is because it was the only way I know how to have a function call not block the script so that the rest of it could continue as normal (there is probably a better way of phrasing this, but I'm not an experienced programmer). &gt; Changing the buffers from a list to a dict I can maybe understand, although tbh I'm not sure why you did? Can you elaborate why you did that? Originally I didn't understand why you were adding things to a list and having them all entered line by line. Now that you mentioned how it was used it makes sense to me. I had thought that declaring multiple variables (eg buff0, buff1) could be simplified with a dictionary, creating the list with a generator (I think that's the right term?) and be able to move away from needing to do global imports. Maybe not an important change after all, maybe I just wanted to screw with things and see if it still worked. &gt; My one REAL complaint (and its fairly minor) is that all of the helper files should have the extension .pyw To be honest I hadn't worked in python enough to even know about that feature or its importance. Makes sense to change it to .pyw. &gt; Adding in a command to view all the buffers is genius Thanks! I learned about pymsgbox from using pyautogui to automate a couple things. It's got some other cool features, you can pass a list to pymsgbox.confirm and it returns the choice the user selected (novel I know...). &gt; And finally, removing kb.write() in favor of kb.send("ctrl+v") honestly doesn't seem to work on my machine; This was actually my main reason for looking to edit the script. When I was testing it and I pasted lines, every time I used Undo it would only remove a small portion of what was pasted and I thought it could be more convenient. The way it's written now the whole series of copied text is loaded into the clipboard and then pasted so it can be undone via one command. Sometimes accessing the clipboard is wonky, so maybe that's why it's not working. Alternately, pyautogui also has a send hotkeys feature, maybe that one would work on your system? Thank you for sharing, I want to move toward some sort of programming career and I think python will help me get there, but I'm kind of wandering aimlessly about it currently. I want to get into more collaborative opportunities and build things with other people. Cheers to the first foray of that :)
A couple of months ago, I remember seeing an active job related thread in r/python. Has it been permanently deleted or just moved elsewhere?

The argument for Trio is basically [laid out in this essay](https://vorpus.org/blog/notes-on-structured-concurrency-or-go-statement-considered-harmful/). It's well worth reading, but in short: Trio preserves causality and makes whole classes of common async problems impossible. The downside is basically that it's a younger project and has somewhat less library support, which may or may not matter for your use-case.

Fantastic! Is there a mysqlxdict?
Thanks. And this differs from Curio how?
Let me know if anyone answers this, I'm curious if OP's book is tDD or TDD
Thank you for the reply!
There is [dataset](https://dataset.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) that uses sqlalchemy so it can read anything but it’s not key-value. It more closely mimics a list of dictionaries. Otherwise, you could probably make one. Sqldict isn’t all too complex.

It would help a lot if you outlined what the application does! &amp;#x200B; Re async server stack: I've used following combination 3 months ago and it works like charm, though I did run into a bug that was since fixed: * quart (asyncio flask) * uvloop (faster evenloop, scales well) * aredis &amp;#x200B; Re database: If you are after relational database, I'd go with MariaDB (a.k.a. MySQL Innodb). For most tasks, any good relational database would do. You will need an async adaptor, and if you have any large queries it's a must. I'd go with plain SQL over SQLAlchemy by default. I'd still call it an open question if application domain requires a relational database. Document databases (mongo, couch) are quite capable and suitable for most tasks, while a graph database may be needed to encapsulate very complex relationships. This leaves relational databases an area where either strong consistency is required, or relatively complex queries are common. &amp;#x200B; Re modern web app: IMO modern web apps are not typically built this way. Rather, there's plain REST-ish data storage and minimal access control, while most logic (traditional SQL queries) is implemented client-side, in Javascript. Sometimes this is enriched with fancier data model, e.g. for complex reports. &amp;#x200B; Overall: It's awesome that you are thinking about scalability, but it's also premature. I worked with a traditional LAMP stack, that's a single-machine, sync PHP talking to local MySQL, that served half a million end users. Typically that meant a few hundred concurrent requests during peak hours. It worked because request processing was short (5\~40ms PHP, &lt;1ms MySQL) and common objects were cached. Years on, the server had to be upgraded from 4-core to 16-core with more RAM, and worked for many years more. I would strongly advise against early scale. Active user base must come first.
Depending on the operations need to perform, you can use the `nrows` parameters to only read a certain number of lines. Or even better, iterates though chunks of the file using `chunksize`, see https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.read_csv.html It will be a problem if you need to have all of one column loaded at once (e.g. you want to do some value binning). If you simply want to perform row operations this will work perfectly.
A bunch of .md files on github. Works like a charm :)
Man I would pay $$ if they could just print it, I find myself much more motivated in reading conceptually focused books through ink/paper.
Hi, I really like this idea of covering professional development essentials like this - like TDD and Mock. Cheers, Rich
if do have a linux server ,you can use cronjob &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
Just so you know, on page 69, the nested `with` statements can be rewritten as: def test_get_info(): ... with patch('os.path.abspath') as abspath_mock, patch('os.path.getsize') as getsize_mock: ... I still think that the decorator is the superior approach, but this is still a good way to patch these functions in a limited scope without deeply nested indentation. Thanks for the book by the way! I've never really used TDD much before, and this is a nice introduction.

Just a suggestion, standardize your views. Currently every page seems to have different sizes and its a bit aggravating. You'll just want to go through each and I'd recommend letting the browser choose the appropriate sizing. Looks cool, though!
1. Don't wildcard import with something so small, you only use TK() from the looks of it. 2. Reddit has code blocks, and Python indentation is super important. Keep it up! :)
Depends on your learning style, but I've come pretty far in about 2 weeks. I understand most core fundamentals and I can achieve most of what I want effortlessly. This comes from about 6 months of JS experience and about 2 months of Powershell experience. &amp;#x200B; If you have no prior language experience, probably not. If you do, then you'll recognize many concepts and it'll be pretty painless. To me, though, "learning" never actually stops. Just knowing the syntax means you have the paint, but there's still techniques to learn before calling yourself an artist.
for humans!!!
You can absolutely suppress this just don't use Wildcard imports. Only import what you need. The only excusable time I can think of (with limited experience) to use Wildcard imports is when using Django to import all models for development. &amp;#x200B; You can absolutely suppress this using /u/commit1's solution below, but in your use case, very simply just don't wildcard.
End of the week, but I just got hired after being laid off, so I'll be doing much more Python from now on.
Here's my findings, having used both for a single project. The project is an IT Database for a retail franchise to track equipment in each store. Flask Benefits: * Best for APIs and low-dependency front-ends * Super fast and easy to deploy with Gunicorn * More control over "sessions" with ease &amp;#x200B; Django Benefits: * Very clean and readable by design, unlike Flask where you define your own structure * ORM makes database work effortless by defining classes to represent your database, whereas Flask you're writing your own SQL * Baked-in auth system, whereas Flask you'll build your own or use an extension * [manage.py](https://manage.py) functions really streamline debugging whereas Flask you only have the dev server to report errors * Baked-in administrative dashboard to very quickly manipulate your objects, whereas Flask you'd have to build your own or manipulate your "objects" with SQL to test * Baked-in security group management to control who can see which views/objects I'll update this a bit if I think of anything else. These benefits are just ones I found in my experience and scoped specifically to what I wanted to achieve with this project. If your project is similar in requirements (database, security groups, cleaner structure, front end rendering, etc) then Django's gonna be the way to go. :)

I think Kenneth gave it an honest try, trying to solve all the things he doesn't like about dependency management. And I think that he succeeded in pushing things forward substantially. If all pipenv commands executed instantly, I'd be fine with it. 
To answer your question regarding pinging, here's how I'd do it on each: Flask: 1. Write a function that pings host and returns a boolean 2. Have a route pointed at that function for an API call 3. On page load send a GET request to that route to return True or False 4. On the front end using JQuery change the color of the dot based on the response Django: 1. Write a function that pings host and returns a boolean 2. Call that function in the view associated with the page user will be looking at, and pass the value to the template 3. Use JQuery to check the value of that value that was passed Keep in mind, though, pinging can be tough. There's a lot of hacky approaches that are a bit easier like sending a cURL request to the host and using the response code to determine if its up. You may have to use your imagination a bit. 
Am I missing something? SQLite in general behaves this way (generates one .sqlite file housing the database).
Except he didn't even try to solve any problem. 
Sorry Bout that :( I will post it on r/learnpython
Great explanation
Try /r/LearnPython for specific Python help.
I don't agree with that at all. I find pipenv to be far easier to reason about than pip and virtualenv alone. Pipenv appeals to my mind the way that previous tools appeal only to the filesystem. I think that its problems are more in the way the pipenv works than in the space it's designed to occupy. 
Just for curiosity, how much ram in the machine? If you have less than about 24GB, you're in for a bad time.
You've been told by the bot before that this kind of post belongs in /r/learnpython 
There's just no reason to use it when there are better tools around. And the more people fall for kenneth's scam, more things will end up dependent on the non-standard project configuration file format he invented, and will be even more harmful to the ecosystem. There's already a standard project description format with PEP 517, and there's already poetry which implements it, as well as other tools that are catching up (being a standard format makes the specific tooling interchangeable), even pip has experimental support already. Poetry does actual dependency constraint solving, and is just as easy to use as pipenv that does nothing but automatically manage a fancy requirements.txt replacement. Poetry also helps with building distributable packages and publishing them to pypi, and combined with shiv can build standalone python zip applications, which can easily be put into a docker container or distributed online. 
&gt;As for the 3 steps of TDD I don't really understand when you say that I don't emphasise them enough. The first project is a learn-by-doing introduction to TDD and follows them in a very strict way. And this is important in my opinion. You can't really be too strict about that if you ask me. Following these rules is essential for successful TDD and if done poorly I think that TDD can often do more harm then good. And especially the reactoring step is not easy. While eliminating code duplication is still rather simple it can be really hard to recognize when and which code to move into new classes. In my opinion proper refactoring requires a good knowledge of design principles. That's why I think an introduction to these steps should come before the practical example. &amp;#x200B; &gt;While I understand what you say about doubles, I don't understand what you are referring to, as I don't name them anywhere. Can you please clarify? Speaking from experience here. When I wrote my first TDD project (which was also my first contact with unit testing in general), like any beginner, I wasn't really sure how to do this properly. This lead to actually asserting too much in my tests. So I was like "better make sure this gets called with these arguments" and so on. And so I used more spies for example than necessary. But a spy creates a dependency from test code to production code, since you're verifying that something is being called in a very specific way. If something changes it's more likely you'll have to change the test afterwards. In some of those cases it would have been enough to use stubs to provide values and then just assert the results of my methods. This is why I think it's important especially for beginners to recognize what you want from your test doubles. You should always use the "lowest" possible form of test double in your test.

&gt;And the more people fall for kenneth's scam Why are you calling it a scam? What about it is a scam? Where does Kenneth make money off of this and how are people harmed? Stop being so hyperbolic, pipenv is completely optional, you don't need to use it if you don't want to, and no one is scamming anyone. This type of discourse is unacceptable and does not help the community. You don't have to like something, you don't have to agree with everyone, but calling things a scam, and using the hyperbolic language you're using doesn't help anything.

Yes it is simple, selenium is simulator for web browsers, it is slower than requests, but is good for grabbing DOM elements, and simulating browsing just as you would do using your favorite browser. Requests is grabing response from websites, it is much faster and easy to use, just read robots.txt files so you don't get banned. When webscraping I suggest trying scraping data using requests first, and if you can't grab some data, use selenium, selenium probably won't disappoint you.

Thank you, that does make some things simpler. Is there a reason to prefer asyncio? Is that what you'd personally use in a new project that only needs to support cpython 3.6+?
I'd recommend csvkit or Google data prep (if you have Google cloud account) . https://csvkit.readthedocs.io/en/1.0.3/
Any materials you suggest after integrating this book for the things you feel it's missing?
With this you'll get an exception with pandas when it hits a bad chunk. You tried want to use: error_bad_lines=false warn_bad_lines=true
This is mostly general bullshit and i don't agree with 80% of it. 
Pandas, argparse, pathlib, requests
Try Gangsta's Paradise Forum it's great!
what are you talking about, a python app you wrote that prints to console made a print dialog appear, or what?
Ah, so the bottom is JQuery on the front end. The backend is Python. print() in Javascript will bring up the print dialog, while what I wanted here was console.log() but being spending most my time on the backend (Python) I accidentally used print lol.
Damn thanks for the video. That guy is really good and never knew you could make games with python untill recently. It really is a jack of all trades. Thanks for the video and will check it out for sure.

Very thanks for your book! But found that my long-lived question about mock is still existed after reading the capter Mock :( Assume that I have no database server in my local machine, but I want to run unit test code in my machine. What I study is about: "unit test should't rely on machine environment". I think that database, and network belongs to the machine environment.. The proper way here, maybe we can mock a database object or database connection. I wonder is there any way that we can mock database operation and check the results ? (Assume that we use pymysql to connect to MySQL database, pymongo to connect to MongoDB..)
&gt;The reason for the removal is that &gt; &gt;/r/Python &gt; &gt; is dedicat thank you for letting me know !!
The `.` symbol, known to some as the dot operator, is the OOP equivalent of brackets when accessing an index in a list. For the statement `self.name` for example, the object identified as `self` has an attribute identified as `name`. Common sense dictates `name` most likely is a string, but it could be anything, this is python after all. In summary though, the `.` simply is an accessor operator, that makes object data interaction easy
Also, from that code, if you were to issue the command `print(first.name)` atfte running it, you would see ”Bucky" get printed.
In Python, everything is an object including a class. It’s really important to understand that when you instantiate an object like you did: first = className() And then access the class method: first.createName(“Bucky”) “first” will be passed as “self” to the method and the string “Bucky” will be passed to the name parameter. 
So what have you done for the community other than spreading poison?
You can think about `self.name` as a short form of `getattr(self, "name")`. And also `self.name = value` as `setattr(self, "name", value)`. That is, get or set *attributes* of some object. Since everything in Python is an object, any entity in your program have some attributes. Also, could you please read the rules of this subreddit, since your question is better to be asked in r/learnpython 
In this instance it may be worth your time to give the docs a read! It helped me a lot when I was learning how to use objects. https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html
That was a really good explanation. I wish pep and linting would have caught my non-tuple use of printf statements.
You don't need to create a virtual environment in your docker container. You don't have to be concerned about conflicting packages since you only install the docker image the packages required for your code. 
If you want overkill, Celery.
Can u share the link mate? 
It works fine, but sometime it is too strict. You have to ignore dependencies and use --skip-lock on some projects.
The dot is accessing an attribute or method of the previous object. `self.name` is accessing the `name` attribute of the `self` object; `first.createName` is accessing the `createName` method of the `first` object. It may be helpful for you to read it backwards, and interpret the dot as the word "of" -- e.g., `self.name` is "name of `self`". The `self` argument is what's known as "syntactic sugar" -- a way of making syntax easier to read. Let's run through a simple example: ``` class Person: def __init__(self, name): self.name = name def speak(self): print('Hi, my name is ' + self.name + '.') class Dog: def __init__(self, name): self.name = name def speak(self): print('Woof!') me = Person('Groovitude') fido = Dog('Fido') ``` In this short example, I've defined four objects in total: 1. The `Person` class; 2. the `Dog` class; 3. an *instance* of the `Person` class; and 4. an *instance* of the `Dog` class. When we call a method on an instance of a class, it's really calling the method on the class it's an instance of. So `me.speak()` is actually calling `Person.speak(me)`. That's where `self` comes in; it's passing that instance to the method on the class. Therefore, you can make the dog speak if you like: ``` &gt;&gt;&gt; Person.speak(fido) Hi, my name is Fido. ```
what's the rush ?
You can actually create packages without publishing to PyPI
Thanks this is great!
what about traffic where cars appear parked in the street?
Silly question I guess but don't you just package your stuff locally and import it like any other dependency? 
Also, please don't use TheNewBoston's tutorials. They're very old and outdated. Go to /r/learnpython for better updated resources.
Neither pipenv or poetry solve the core problem which is the way that Python installs packages. Not even virtualenv solves it. It just alleviates the pain. Whatever fix is required, it needs to happen in setuptools, and in python...

Another option would be to put the package on the PATH. This has the benefits of being imported like a normal module without having to publish it. Or create a Github repo for the package(s) you want to reuse. 
Agreed
Package with PyPi or create git repos and submodule them. 
Trio sort of branched off from Curio. They have different goals and philosophies in mind but the TLDR is to use trio
Now I'm curious :) what kind of sistems are we talking about? Is it something you can share?

All of this is for testing only, i try it on my own second computer.
Also worth checking out the O'Reilly book, "Test Driven Development with Python." It goes from nothing to fully functioning blog with full functional unit and functional tests, and an extremely clear step by step illustration. The author publishes it for free, online... Though I've personally bought multiple copies "to share" and stay updated. It's probably the best "How to" book I've ever read in the technical market. https://obeythetestinggoat.com/
I was sceptical as im generating not using an exe. Thanks for your reply man
Your section on Mocking and Patching really helped this all click for me. I could work with basic tests before, but seeing others on my team write awesome tests was frustrating. Now I’m set to write them well :) Thanks!
Maybe it was me thinking there might be more than one file.
I suppose if you were to get into more complex database needs, maybe, but an sqlite database is a single file.
This is a really good explanation. I would however recommend you talk of it as analogous to brackets for dictionary access, since Python attributes are by default stored in a dict (yes this isnt entirely accurate).
Have only 10 days before next semester, need enough knowledge to start a decent project.
Don't use it, pipenv is awful. Poetry and piptools will get the job done quickly then get out of your way
It's an email address man, its of little to no value. You can create a new one in less than a minute and a temporary one in less than 30 seconds. 
It's never too late to start again, mate =) Honestly, sometimes you need to deliver things and you can't be strict. I really believe that doing things properly save time, but it's also true that we don't live in a perfect universe, and sometime constraints force you to just deliver. Some types of software cannot be tested with TDD (for technical or business reasons). And after all we went to the moon without TDD. However, it's never too late to add tests, to introduce the testing culture, to review the way you develop. I hope the book will be useful!
Pretty much any IDE out there has customizable color schemes, if that's what you're asking.
&gt; If you like spending hours debugging your programs or staying late at the office to recover from a buggy deploy in production this book is definitely NOT for you! Darn it!
YT-link doesn‘t seem to work..
I know that other authors sell their books through other services like Amazon that can print the books. For example Fabien Sanglard (Game Engine Black Book) and Harry Percival (Test-Driven Development with Python). I actually didn't believe I could reach 4,800+ readers, so I opted for the safest solution. I will look into printing it, however, it might be viable. Thanks for the comment
I can't look it up right now, but I usually throw it somewhere in \\lib (if I remember correctly \\site-packages) where it gets compiled and is available from any new project I start. Might me totally the wrong way, but works for me.
Thanks for the clarification!
Yes I agree with /u/nicholosophy. The whole purpose of a virtual environment is to isolate the running environment of a Python process from that of other Python processes, basically in order to be free to install potentially bugged version of libraries, or versions of those that break the APIs. A Docker container is a completely separate environment also in terms of memory, CPU and filesystem - don't call it virtual machine, or they will kill you, but in the end this is what it is =) This means that in a Docker container you are free to install Python packages system-wide without worrying too much, generally speaking. There might be rare edge cases in which the container uses Python to run the system and you don't want to mess with it, but I wouldn't bother.
Thanks, I hope you will find it useful
Thanks! I hope you will enjoy the book
I will donate after I actually read it. Thanks!
You are right, and actually I had in mind to clarify when to use the decorator and when to go for the `with` statement. I also prefer to localise the patching, but generally don't like more than one nested `with`. Thanks for the comment and for reading the book!

I definitely understand your question, as dealing with those external systems is a big problem. I tried to explain this in Part 2, Chapter 4, when I add real databases to the project. Long story short you CAN mock database operations, but in practice, since you are probably using some sort of library to abstract those, you SHOULDN'T, unless you want to spend hours writing mocks and end up with test code that is extremely coupled with the specific library you are using. I don't think it is worth the effort, given that you can easily set up integration tests. Feel free to come back to me if you want to discuss the matter further, it's always good to talk, as it makes me learn new things ;)
I respect the intent behind this, I just dislike how a lot of people misuse these tools and delete everything they ever posted (even posts with no sensitive info), effectively ruining older threads. Most of the time hiding the author of a post would be a good enough fix to prevent doxxing, I wish reddit would add this as a feature.
You are welcome!
Yes, Harry Percival's book is one of the best books you can find around. Thanks for mentioning it
Let's start with the workflow question... typically the workflow is something like this 1. Train (&amp; test) your model 2. 'Package' your trained model for deployment 3. Deploy and use the trained model A quite good high-level explanation of these different steps can be found [here](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/a-beginners-guide-to-training-and-deploying-machine-learning-models-using-python-48a313502e5a) &amp;#x200B; I'm not f
Glad to know that it was useful. It took me ages and several different rewrites to reach a version that I thought was readable, so it's good to know that it was worth the effort ;) Enjoy writing tests
If it's &gt; 50 lines of code, deploy it to pypi. If it's &lt; 50 lines of code, copy and paste it and stick it in a "utils.py" file for each project.
Any Python developer should make a folder called Utilities or Tools. Put all the stuff you make that has reusability in there, add a `__init__.py` file and put it into your path. 
Ha ha ha, sorry to suck the fun out of your day mate =)
Thank you for reading it, please share it if you find it useful!

What are you talking about?
/r/learnpython, and you really need to be more specific about your assignment.
Pycharm is a good one..
The more correct answer: nobody knows. Here's why: your example is too simplistic, and it is actually possible to tell what dot means in it. But, say, you inherited this class from another programmer, and you don't really know what the source code looks like, then you could still extend the class you inherited, but you wouldn't know what dot is doing there. In the context of a class, dot may mean two things. In other languages this kind of polysemy is called "overloading". I.e. the same name refers to many different things, and some mechanics in the language automatically figure out which one of those many things a programmer wanted. Obviously, sometimes the automatic process (or, more likely, the programmer), get it wrong. So. 1. One way to interpret the dot is to say that it is a procedure to access members of the object its first argument refers to (`self` in your case). In Python, member lookup first looks into instance members and then into class member (misnamed `type` in Python). This may also result in a reference to procedure, which may then be called (typically, procedures are stored in the class, rather than the instance). 2. If, the lookup described above results in an object that implements property protocol, then functionality of `getattr` / `setattr` becomes also available. 3. If the lookup described above results in an object that implements call protocol, then functionality of calling a procedure becomes available. 4. If none of the above happens, then it is interpreted to be a simple class field, which may be either: 4.1. A slot. 4.2. A dynamic class field. So, dot will result in one of the five outcomes described above. Needless to say, that a class may implement `getattr` / `setattr` protocol in a way you don't expect, and that will result in... something you don't expect. So, essentially, the possibilities are endless for what the dot may mean.

You can't just run PySerial like this. You need to install it using `pip`. Also, /r/learnpython.
An alternative is to load it to staging table in postgres and then process it. 
&amp;#x200B; Thank you. I posted on /r/learnpython and will do so from now on. Is there a website or place you know of for stupid people like myself that takes you through it easy? Every website I go to I can't understand the jargon. Even here [https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/#installing-with-get-pip-py](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/#installing-with-get-pip-py) I don't get what to do lol. Anyway I'll wait for the learnpython replies. Thank you!
As others have said you could install with pip directly from a git repository (even remotely hosted on something like github). Please don't pollute the PyPI namespace with your one-off packages. It's hard enough to come up with a package name that isn't taken.
If it's reusable then it's not really one off it it?
THANK YOU MAN! I was going through a tutorial of this yesterday that was really difficult to follow and I couldn't grasp it. I am going to watch these when I get home from work and see if I can follow it better!
Mod over here, for privacy issues, I cannot tell you who is impersonating who. Please read the privacy policy, thank you.
You should have pip itself installed already. Just run `python3 -m pip install pyserial`.
True. Are you advertising these new packages? Asking for contributions? Does the package have a larger goal than one or two functions? I was focusing on your 50 lines part and it made me think you were jumping to package creation instead of contributing to another existing project with similar goals as a first attempt.
Comment on the video if you need any help :)
Or you can try : import getpass getpass.getpass() But ,as you probably noticed, those functionality is untended for password getting))
Anaconda vets all the code in the package. It gives you a bit more security against supply chain attacks. As you learn more, you’ll likely end up using more and more packages, which just means you won’t need to install them. Just food for thought. 
I used to use anaconda but the pip packages for DS/ML stack has gotten a lot better lately so now I just use debian python/pip

Yeah, makes sense. More information is better so long as it doesn't make the code messy.
Right, make sense, context is important! Thanks for your input.
