I’m gonna assuming this photo was taken in the UK due to the fact the kid is wearing these. Kids over here that are football (soccer) mad tend to go through a phase of wearing AstroTurf boots everywhere. They don’t have studs on them so they can get away with using them as normal trainers (sneakers). I hope this answers your question lol.
Gave a talk at the London Data Science Festival on Shadow Deployments. Wrote up the details here: https://medium.com/@christopher.samiullah/deploying-machine-learning-models-in-shadow-mode-c47ac40b4cc9?source=friends_link&amp;sk=c8881c56fb8dafa901c88844dc670b0d This content is part of me promoting this course on Deployment of Machine Learning Models in Python https://www.udemy.com/deployment-of-machine-learning-models/?couponCode=REDDIT2019 Course covers: - ML system architecture options - Using scikit-learn pipelines - Packaging models - Flask APIs for delivering predictions - Use of CI/CD for training/testing/deployment - Specific ML testing approaches - Dockerizing applications - Deployment on PaaS (Heroku) - Deployment on IaaS (AWS) Just passed 1000 students, with continued 4.6/5 rating :)
This is why we have unit tests. And alcohol.
Create 26 images from the example pictures having width of 1/8 of this example image and height of 1/8 of example height. Load them in memory, scrape targeted image and divide it on 64 fields, iterate through all of them and compare each to those 26 using Pillow's ImageChop.difference.
I'm part data engineer, part manager, so usually in the morning we go through standup, any technical discussion followups, 1on1s with my direct reports, and then in the afternoon have some time carved up to work on my own stories. &amp;#x200B; I then spend some time writing code with vim + sublimetext, developing tests, documentation, querying databases, have other internal project tabs open for good examples or packages to import and use, have google tabs open for some topics that i'm unsure about, etc. I use a lot of tooling around all of this to automate things, simple stuff like chaining git commands for a flow, deploying my updates to a package to a development cluster, managing EMR clusters (spin-up, scale-up, spin-down), black auto formatting on commits. &amp;#x200B; The actual code i'm writing tends to be based on technical proposals written at least 1 quarter ago to tackle some technical or business related problem. Usually involves moving data, doing something to it, and writing to some destination while guaranteeing data integrity, low latency, scalable, robust and recoverable pipelines. &amp;#x200B; And throughout all of this i'm probably looking at Slack and participating in discussions and threads across several channels, sometimes to address questions from more junior people, most of the time talking to my immediate team on story implementation details, and on more rare occasions to the VP and CTO on hiring and long term projects/vision. &amp;#x200B; On my free time i like to work on some small personal projects that help me do some X annoying thing by automating it. For example, i just scrapped this together a few days ago to regularly send me text messages when currency exchange rates drop below a certain value: [https://github.com/tchoedak/exa](https://github.com/tchoedak/exa). and this one to send me text alerts when I have new orders on amazon: [https://github.com/tchoedak/anoti](https://github.com/tchoedak/anoti)
Cool! I've mostly been trying to gauge where you are and what you want out of the project. It's a good sized but totally do-able project. &amp;#x200B; I'm going to inline some "interesting" formulae for you below (I'm going to use the standard en-US locale for consistency in coercions and syntax). &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; There are a few of these I expect you'll never add, but they're just fun talking points for learning about Excel's behaviour, especially for parts you may not have seen before (N.B. other "spreadsheet" programs may do things differently, but I think Google Sheets is consistent with all of those). There are also lots of functions and some of them behave strangely (like IF()) especially if you can observe things like strictness. &amp;#x200B; Enjoy!
\&gt; People don't understand how to manage and package python applications. It's hard if you are in the field. it's even harder if you are not. &amp;#x200B; I haven't been able to find any good documentation on this. There's ancient stuff about virtualenv, eggs, wheels, all jumbled together and it's hard to tell what's current and what's not. My current (horrible) configuration is a pipenv inside a conda env, but I still get cases where I install/update things but the changes don't show up in the path.
Holy shit this was happening to me months ago and I never figured it out. What the fuck. Thank you.

That wasn't quite what I was trying to explain. I'd say the TL;DR is more like "the class instantiation syntax in Python is identical to the syntax for calling a function, which means the distinction between classes and functions is subtle and can often be overlooked without consequence"
For python projects being deployed you don't have a ton of options. It's pretty much cx_Freeze, pyinstaller, or py2exe and that's about it. They all end up with an executable, and they all do about the same thing. The issue isn't really deployment since it's kinda hard to mess that up. The bigger concern is how your "query database and display results (PyQT)" are architected and implemented. For example, if you just have a ton of functions across a bunch of files, chances are it's not done well. This is probably what OP meant about scripters. You should have a good architecture, likely model view controller or some derivative thereof. You should have good object oriented design and should use composition and inheritance where it makes sense. You should still follow SOLID principles. All of those things you're not going to get from someone that is used to just writing scripts, even of those scripts do accomplish meaningful work. The issue is that when scripters use Python their code is not usually flexible in the right ways, easily extensible, organized, highly readable, etc.

Ideally you would reinvent the wheel and then throw your code away and download a package and use theirs. One time I ended up recreating the guts of a message broker and it was certainly good for my own knowledge sake but bad because I didn't implement it as good as an open source package would've. Obviously almost no manager is going to allow for this sort of behavior so this is something you have to do outside of work.
What are the missing libraries? I did pip install matplotlib but don’t know what else is needed
I did this as well what else is needed?
At various points in my career it would have been equally appropriate to have a VB (before .net), vb.net, C#, Perl, amongst many. Kind of glad I didn't. Is there a config.sys tattoo I could get?
I will look into this, thank you!
Please dear lord stop spreading misinformation. Python is pass-by-object-reference. Given some variable, when passed to a function or otherwised aliased, the reference to the underlying object is passed, a copy is not created. Where it "doesn't work", you passed an object reference, added 5, which created a new temporary, then assigned the object-reference of that temporary to the local variable. Where it "works", you passed an object reference, added 5 *to that reference, assigning back internally to that reference, as this was in-place additiom*.
&gt; If a company manages dependencies using export PYTHONPATH, run. Or with conda. Shower me in downvotes, I'm ready.
With all due respect, &gt; * there is no pointer type; &gt; * there is no way to ask for a pointer to an object, or a variable; &gt; * no way to ask what variable, or object, exists at a certain memory address; &gt; * no way to dereference a memory address and find out what is at that location, or write to it; &gt; * you can't assume that an object will always have the same memory location (in some implementations, like Jython and IronPython, objects can and will move around in memory); &gt; * You can't do pointer arithmetic. Most people use CPython and not some other variant, there was a time where PyPy, IronPython, and Jython were getting traction but they have become less and less relevant now, with the latter two staying on Py2.X and the first just not being too many compromises. Given that, all but the second to last bullet point is false (because we are assuming CPython). You can get the memory address from `id`, `ctypes` has pointer types, and can dereference arbitrary memory addresses as both C types and Python objects (however it cannot convert between the two). Because you have the address, you can do arithmetic on it and potentially get meaningful results (however you have to have a deep knowledge of Python's internal structure to do so).
Is this Mr. Python himself?
Motion designer? Is that like a Motion Graphic Artist or similar? I've been meaning to take that up as a hobby, but I don't know where I can find really good tutorials for it. Or if Blender's even the best tool for the job.

I've been doing Low-Vision research for a few years now using OpenCV, however using C libraries. &amp;#x200B; Regardless, there are a few things I would check first: 1. Are your connections correct? Create a simple program first; look at your servo's manual as they usually include examples of source code, as well as the breadboard schematics. Ultimately we just want to make sure your layer 1 (physical layer) connections are all correct. 2. Create print statements/serial connection that constantly prints out your variable values. Doing so, we can ensure that your camera is picking something up and is changing as expected. 3. Source code -- please share your source code or at least a snippet for reference. Here we want to check for simple syntax errors (it happens to all of us). &amp;#x200B; Additionally, if you want to hop in my discord, which is a discord community built for gamers and developers, please PM me and I'll send you the link! It'll be much faster this way and I'm available all night.
Ok so I am very new to python (last 2 months) and coding in general and I was wondering what the difference between python scripting and python programming, I think I would fall under scripter. If I understand correctly python is a high-level language so how would one 'program' in python as opposed to script.
Anaconda’s pretty cool if you’re looking to have a single installer give you Python Data Science in a box. If you were going to use Jupyter notebook and would have to pip install pandas/numpy/etc. etc anyway, Anaconda makes it really simple to get set up without all the hoopla. It’s a one stop shop for a full Python toolkit with some of the most popular libraries. That said, I prefer to install Python3 and then use venv and `pip install` things myself, and just have only the things I need for each project. I’d say if you don’t want to mess with environment setup, don’t care about having the absolute most recent release of all libraries, aren’t allowed by your company’s IT department to download any random library off the internet, are on Windows and just need Python to work, or just generally like the Anaconda ecosystem, then choose that route. If you want the latest of everything, know your way around a Unix system, understand and have access to pip, prefer a light install that always uses a venv/virtualenv, then use a hand rolled Python3 install. Also, whatever you do, avoid Python 2 at all costs at this point.
i generally prototype and get my logic worked out in an Anaconda (Jupyter) environment and then get all the cleaned code into Pycharm for the real liftng to be done. You can install Jupyter Notebooks without anaconda, but anaconda gives you a really solid set of libraries and some other goodies for an easy couple click install
Not the same as the person you responded to, but when I think of that difference I'm thinking along the lines of not really understanding the trade-offs to be made when writing code. For example, someone who doesn't really understand the difference in time complexity between a lookup in an unordered list vs. a lookup in a set. You can still solve a smaller scale problem using either data structure and write a script that will do the thing you need it to, but someone who doesn't understand the difference between them might write a ridiculously inefficient program if the amount of data is large and every lookup is searching through a list. For the record, doing a lookup in an unordered list means that you need to walk through potentially every element of the list in the worst case (the element you're looking for doesn't exist), while doing a lookup on a set will hash the input, giving a near-exact location in the set where the element is or should be, which could drastically reduce the time spent doing a lookup if you have to do a lot of lookups on a lot of data.
Ok because I saw a thread about how anaconda was the greatest, and I didn't really know what it did, so thanks for the clarification, and now I have decided I probably won't use it because I am an amateur programmer and learned python like 2 months ago and haven't don anything more complex then make a discord bot.
Ok, assuming I understood what you said, thanks for the info.
r/learnpython Post the code you've already written with specific questions regarding what you don't understand. No body wants to do your homework for you, but there are good folks out there willing to help you learn.
Lately? Meetings, meetings, meetings. Some code. Some figuring out why breakpoints in my Django code aren't stopping in PyCharm. Oh and more meetings.
It gives you all the standard packages used in scientific computing in a convenient package without having to worry about installing them all individually with their dependencies. If you don't plan on using typical scientific computing packages (numpy, matplotlib, scipy, pandas, etc.) or any of the packaged software (jupyter notebooks, spyder IDE), then the main downside is just that you're downloading software that you don't need. Regardless if you go with a distribution like Anaconda or just a fresh python environment, it's useful to learn about environment management and package installation with pip and venv or conda. Besides the convenience, there's not going to be a major difference between using anaconda vs setting up your own environment. It's all the same python underneath the hood.
You're still making python2 tutorials?
Wasm is sandboxed and has the same security model of javascript. So it has no more exploitable surface area than it did before.
I’m pretty sure You can make a Jupyter notebook right inside Pycharm. I know for sure VSCode does too. No need to edit code in a web browser text area when you can have the goodness of Jupyter with all your awesome editor features like macros and multi-cursor.
Even as a die hard Linux dude I am starting to really like VSCode.
How big are your matrices and what do you use them for? I use TPS that work very very well for mapping deflections or modes.
Anaconda is nice if you do science and don't mind having one massive environment for all your projects.
I thought anaconda was for individual projects?
Anyone looking to sell their ticket?
I should have been clear that I use them both for radial splines and Gaussian Processes. Same sized matrices (a NxN gram Matrix inversion) and an MxN matrix for evaluating. N is usually O(1e3) up to O(1e4) on the large side. M is O(1e4) up to O(1e6) but I can chunk that up at will. Gaussian Processes are really hard for this since it needs to do high-dimensional non-convex, *global* optimization with the NxN inversion at each iteration.
Thanks. This is exactly what I’m looking for.
One reason is that many high level libraries have underlying bindings and libraries that may be written in other languages. If you install them separately and even a different order you can run into problems. Anaconda has most of these ones that you need prepackaged and installed in correct way so you don't ever have to worry about packages.
Avoid compilation. Avoid energy waste.
&gt; If a company manages dependencies using export PYTHONPATH, run. Can you explain this to one of the aforementioned scripters?
Not sure you're using the word organically correctly here...
I briefly looked at the code and from what I can see it seems that you should really break up your functions more. As a rule of thumb, each function should typically only accomplish one task and it is usually an abstract task, not just a compilation of instructions. Also, instagram has an API, using selenium to accomplish this task is a pretty bad implementation. In general if a web task can be automated using requests rather than an acura browser, that’s the better solution.
Honestly it seems to me the only value of it is if you’re on Windows as getting the right version of MSVC for a lot of things was a huge pain in the ass. On Linux or Mac I never saw the point.
Yes, it comes with conda, which allows you to create separate environments. Each environment can have a different version of python and a different set of libraries. However, the base environment that comes along with your anaconda install is pretty gigantic and sometimes people use that base environment and don't bother creating per-project environments.
As @[BernieFeynman](https://www.reddit.com/user/BernieFeynman) mentioned, the non-python dependencies are handled by anaconda as well. This has two advantages: 1) it's easier and 2) the anaconda package is often built with a lot of optimization. The numpy version in anaconda is built against intel's math kernel library, which means the compiled C code runs faster than it would with the pip version.
CPU intensive implies memory intensive in Python, doesn't it? There's no register allocation or static analysis, everything lives in the heap. You cannot process anything on the CPU without the interpreter having to dereference big duck typed PyObjects, and the access pattern is probably never contiguous.
I tend to install Miniconda (Anaconda’s much smaller sibling distribution) as a way to get ‘conda’ (the package manager), and then use conda to create environments for each project. Conda has some really nice features: * You can entirely define an environment, including the version of python, using ‘environment.yml’ files * It has a much more powerful dependency solver than pip, making it less likely you’ll end up with an inconsistent environment * It tries to install everything as a transaction * It (sort of) works with pip The Anaconda team maintains the core scientific stack you get when you install Anaconda, but the the “conda forge” channel includes a lot of the other major Python packages not included in Anaconda.
If you're learning, using python for data science, or doing a university project, I recommend Spider. It's inside Anaconda. Highly helpful IDE.
Nice, congratulations
Anaconda is a all in one software package for Python. Now whether that's greatest for you or not depends on your use case.
Can I flip this question around? Why in the world would you *not* use Anaconda? Works on all operating systems, includes most all packages you'd want to get started, handles virtual embodiments, comes with an IDE and notebooks already set up, and so on. I have no idea why you'd go with just a base Python system install.
Yea but its php
I just use vim for all my coding. Am I missing out on a lot by not using Pycharm?
Yeah, why?!
Also, shoutout to pipenv, which combines automatic venv creation with pip. It has some wrinkles, but I really enjoy using it and would definitely recommend it (side note, I think it's got fewer kinks when using it for development than for deployment, which is amusing given that it's intended primarily as a deployment tool)
Didn’t know about this, thanks for sharing! I love virtual environment and pip. What are some wrinkles?
SharePoint? My condolences.
&gt; people who claim they can code in python, but they are not programmers, rather they are scripters and don't understand that between writing a python script and writing a python program there's an abyss. As a beginner myself, what would be the simplest way to differentiate between the 2? Does scripting just mean a lines of code running in sequence without the concepts of classes and functions?
`math.sin` and `math.cos` are also not perfectly precise.
Great for data science stuff. Otherwise just stick to managing your own envs and packages imo. You learn more by managing stuff yourself.
I would recommend giving an appropriate heading to summarise your Post, rather than a pun
Can I see the code? &amp;#x200B; If you import the script you have access to all top level variables, and they point back like they should if anything changes. &amp;#x200B; You can &amp;#x200B; from \*script\* import \*variable\* &amp;#x200B; Or &amp;#x200B; from y import x as z &amp;#x200B; from x import \*
My understanding is that you have script1.py running and from script2.py you import the first one to see the variable? This won't work, because every program you run has its own memory - you'd need to use some sort of shared memory solution, if you want to keep it as 2 separate programs. If you can combine them into 1 program, I'd use threads /async. Basically when you detect an event that makes you want to move a servo - create new thread that only moves it to desired position. This way you can continue looking for changes on the image, while the servo moves. Look up asyncio in standard python library.
It takes over my path. I like i but I hate it.
You eventually run into small, but very annoying issues with Pipenv, concerning version locking and performance in large projects. I found Poetry to be superior https://poetry.eustace.io/
I use it for Python version management and venv creation. I install Miniconda, and then use Conda to create environments with specific Python versions (per each project). I then use Poetry to manage packages within those environments.
Its better than having to sit at a computer for many hours and doing this by hand
instagram's api doesnt allow this kind of task for example it cant just index new people to follow this is the way to go for such an automaiton script intsa api can be for example sharing a picture i get this comment a lot but trust me i have done a lot of research and for this case this is the way to go by the way i needed to break 6-7 line functions even more O\_O
&gt; April 2019 &gt; Still not using f-strings &gt; [MFW](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/952/664/4b6.jpg)
Because it had one role that I can't seem to find anywhere else
Don't know why you are being downvoted. Having tried a variety of IDEs I feel the same at this point. Anaconda + Spyder gives me everything I need.
You should read up a bit on "floating point arithmetic", in Python and in general in programming.
Use it on windows. It keeps your python away from your system variables so it's okay if you screw around with installations, nothing will get terribly lost in your filesystem
Haha I remember when Learn Python the Hard Way told the reader to use Python 2 and avoid Python 3. https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/nopython3.html
No downvote, but I’m interested to hear what’s so bad about Conda?
Jupyter notebook is pretty nice for beginners actually. You can run individual pieces of codes and try them out. You write code on different cells. You can have as many cells as you want. So maybe one of my functions is in 1 cell. If I want to run only that function and check if it works etc, I can do that. It’s a feature much more suited to new ppl. I used to use it a lot earlier. Now I do some things that are not easily possible on it. But I’d highly recommend a beginner to use it

Zed Shaw is very anti python 3 so it's not surprising his book website is too.
Hello u/icountedmychickens! Appreciate your time in going through the source code! I was planning to setup a GUI admin dashboard from where the bot user can tune it’s parameters like tweet frequency, including/removing tweet content aggregator functions (“scrapers”), retweet and favourite flags (whether to retweet and favourite tweets or not), adding / removing keywords as well as reply messages and so on. As a first step, what I was planning is that the bot should follow an admin account - which can just tweet or DM the bot account commands like “add keyword docker”. That’s why in “main.py” admin handler is defined as a listener. I’ll implement these functionalities when I find time, maybe in the upcoming summer. What other features can I have? Can you please suggest some functionalities? Thanks!
Only if you install it with that option checked, and it warns you not to do so.
I have never used vim but my experience of PyCharm is great! Best IDE I could want, fast, has smart autofill, formatting suggestions, the whole nine yards, and as an added bonus, it looks slick.
&gt;aren’t allowed by your company’s IT department to download any random library off the internet This is my main reason. Just about got away with Anaconda, but installing libraries separately is a *HUGE* pain.
Anaconda is used by many python noobs and often gets the rep of being a tool for noobs, BUT it was created by python gods and completely simplifies installing(/writing install scripts for) large and often finicky libraries on several different operating systems. I used to hate on anaconda when I used to believe I had to configure and compile everything myself; now I dilligaf and anaconda is so good and can install anything better than me anywhere.
Oh my fucking god what a stupid text. Yes I get it, he doesn't think strings are solved perfectly in Python 3. Not everything revolves around strings though. As for his 'argument' regarding the "too many formatting functions" - seriously? *Seriously?*
&gt; The numpy version in anaconda is built against intel's math kernel library, which means the compiled C code runs faster than it would with the pip version. that is interesting. i didnt know that. for those interested, here are diy instructions: https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/numpyscipy-with-intel-mkl
I'm also a beginner and I started without Anaconda. I can say that life with Anaconda is WAY EASIER FOR A BEGINNER like us. Seriously, it's worth it.
Organically would mean something like "people following you because they are actually interested in your posts". What you've created instead is a Follow-bot which is gaining you followers because some fraction of the accounts your Follow-bot follows, follow you back. This is not organic, it is pumping numbers simply to pump numbers. You are gaining followers that are following you for no reason at all. It is even possible that you are triggering other account's Follow-bots which would be the exact opposite of "organic". We usually call things like your bot "gaming the system". Since you are gaining followers who don't care at all what you are posting, we might call it "foolishly and wastefully gaming the system to benefit no one".
Why not use a database?
Try Google datalab.. It's same as jupyter notebook with all libraries pre installed.

Just because
Pipenv provides those features as well - environment with dependencies and interprrter version defined in Pipfile, deterministic builds thanks to package version locking, and is to-be standard already recommended by PyPA (creators of pip). From what I know Anaconda performs better in installing binary dependencies.
So does he still stand for the same idea?
I love Python but the typo bugs or different data types than you anticipated can slow down development quite a bit. A while back I decided to use type hinting everywhere and that has massively reduced the errors in this region and increases readability. It works well with Python 3.6+
&gt; PyPy is not worth it pypy3 runs it in 0.2s vs 1.45s with python3 (on a 7 year old laptop, so I'm wondering why I'm faster with this than the author)
3.141592653589793 is the closest approximation of pi I can use; closer approximations get rounded. sin(3) ~= +0.1411200080598672 sin(3.1) ~= +0.0415806624332904 sin(3.14) ~= +0.0015926529164868 sin(3.141) ~= +0.0005926535550994 sin(3.1415) ~= +0.0000926535896604 sin(3.14159) ~= +0.0000026535897933 sin(3.141592) ~= +0.0000006535897930 sin(3.1415926) ~= +0.0000000535897931 sin(3.14159265) ~= +0.0000000035897930 sin(3.141592653) ~= +0.0000000005897932 sin(3.1415926535) ~= +0.0000000000897931 sin(3.14159265358) ~= +0.0000000000097931 sin(3.141592653589) ~= +0.0000000000007932 sin(3.1415926535897) ~= +0.0000000000000933 sin(3.14159265358979) ~= +0.0000000000000032 sin(3.141592653589793) ~= +0.0000000000000001 Python can store floating-point values as low as 5&amp;#215;10^(-323), or "0.000005" with 322 zeros after the decimal point, so we still have a lot of digits available.

got it, I will let you know when I try it out :)
I'm not 100% sure actually. He did an interview on the Changelog recently but I can't remember if they touched on that, but I'd say probably. I'd definitely recommend that episode he says a lot of things that made me think even if I don't necessarily agree with many of things he said.
If you want the ideal solution, ie retrieving the data from the API, you’ll have to create a development app with Facebook (you’ll need s Facebook developer account, easy to make), apply for access to the groups API, and get approved. I’m pretty sure the new groups API is available, but you need to apply for access which generally means having your app reviewed by FB.
Wow..I would argue that for absolute beginners Anaconda is the right way to start. I did the same 6 months ago. ( I am into data analytics , not so sure for someone in Web Dev or something like that)
Call me a purist, but I'm not using Anaconda, because I want to have a complete control over both dev and production environments. In most cases on both platforms, I only have to install desired Python version from OS package manager and run pip or pipenv to get going.
Can you shed some light on learning about environments? I use Python only for data analysis. Does it make sense for me to learn about environments?
Thanks for sharing!
You don't need everything anaconda installs. They have a mini version (called minconda) which suits all of my needs perfectly well. I really prefer the update function of conda to pip.
Is there any reason not to primarily install new packages with pip install --user and just use venv if you need?
fukin pussies Thinkin small in 2019
Do you even know about SEO How it is messing up search indexed it isnt "cheating" the system many as a matter of fact most small businesses do this manually to gain attention i just automated this system with much much better efficiency and for good purposes indeed
If you only need less then a MB of total memory, you should not be limited by memory as everything needed for the calculations would stay in the caches removing the memory limit.
you can use file system in python aswell write it to a file and read it and shred whitespaces and convert to int
If you put it on a class then the instance of it will keep a reference to the latest value at all times.

Add to this fishshell with auto venv - https://github.com/kennethreitz/fish-pipenv If you're in the project directory you're using the project's venv python. cd to another project and it switches to that python instance automatically.
The moment I realized why people recommend anaconda was when I learned ML and wanted to use tensorflow. Tensorflow does not work on python 3.7 so I had to install 3.6 too. All the answers regarding the envinronment thing are confussing for beginners, except the anaconda solution. It literally has a button called "environments" where you can install all kind of different python versions and activate them whenever you want.
You didn't suspect that they didn't want you automating tasks that are specifically left out of their API? Or you didn't suspect that spamming people with likes was annoying and provides no value to the service or to users?
Try running it in a virtual environment python -m vent .env Source .env/bin/activate pip3 install -r requirements.txt —upgrade
EOL, bro
I'm not a beginner but even I found Anaconda much easier than setting up Jupyter et al. seperately. No reason not to have it installed. You can always have Vanilla python installed too
true but even when it actually hits the EOL date legacy code-bases will still need to be supported for years to come.... that said, maybe move on to python3 tutorials.
Reduce is moved from builtins to the functools library in python 3.
Although I've used Anaconda before it is really taxing on the computer's RAM. I personally use Pycharm. It is free for a .edu email account for a year. It is the best env IMO!!!!
I think it depends on the nature and extent of your analysis. When I started most of my team was used to excel so I'd essentially present my diagrams and findings but the working behind them was a black box to them that I managed completely. Often I'd then never revisit the code, and so this "one and done" analysis, while arguably not best practice, didn't really need envs. I've sinced changed roles and now my team is more interested in repeatable and reproducible processes that they can also run and play with. This combined with me leaning into using interactive dashboards means it's extremely important to set up environments that basically say 'I ran this code using exactly this set up. Click here and you can have exactly the same layout so it will work on your machine too' The other amazing benefit which might be most useful is if project 1 needs numpy version 1.2 but you're also working on project 2 which only works on numpy version 0.8 then you can install both projects in different environments and not have the stress of trying to upgrade/downgrade all the time Long answer but I hope it helps!
You're going about this the wrong way. Instead of using OCR, just grab the data from the [DOM](https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_htmldom.asp). If you inspect the site, you can see that the board is nothing but a HTML table whose values you can read off with any of the standard methods. Personally, I like BeatifulSoup for these kinds of things.
My experience so far: I was using crud flask to develop my json api (angular doing the frontend). It's far easier with fastapi. This tool is dedicated and I'm more productive. I really hope this gonna be the standard for api dev in python (to get more mainteners). The auto doc feature is just huge to test things as it is going. I didn't wanted to use any other framework than flask (restful, restfulplus, connexion, falcon...) and this framework made me change my mind. The documentation is awesome. You don't even need any tutorial. Actually I'm in love with this documentation (highlights in tutorial scripts for the step by step comprehension is so darn cool) Thanks for your work. It's great quality. And please... continue! Maybe one day I'll be good enough to contribute!
Using autocompletion, snippets, graphical designers etc is faster in the beginning but I remember more and get a better understanding when I write the code myself
I posted the full output.
Try with math.pi/2.
Anaconda let’s you create virtual environments that are accessible from any location and with any version of Python. It also has prebuilt libraries that would otherwise have to be built if you use pip; great if you don’t have Visual Studio set up with your Python. As a bonus, it comes with MKL for free, so the code that relies on numpy is 5x faster. That’s something that the base numpy wheels do not have.
I recommend Spyder (the IDE that comes with Anaconda) over Jupyter Notebooks, at least for beginners. It has the same code-cell idea, but it uses normal .py files instead of .ipynb and you don't need to launch the jupyter server just to see and run your code. Using .py files also makes it easier to commit to github etc.
Take a look at https://beeware.org/
Honestly as a (mediocre) Python dev who has done some DS/jupyter work, I really prefer it without Anaconda. I have had trouble with the versioning before and having to switch between pip and conda is (for me) an unnecessary hassle. I like to work in light virtual envs and ‘pipenv install jupyter’ followed with ‘pipenv install pandas’ just makes it the easiest thing ever.
Possibly an unpopular opinion here, but I'm gonna go ahead and say no. You don't need to use different environments if all you're doing is running your own Python scripts to process data with pandas, matplotlib etc. In my experience virtual environments just get in the way of the science. Virtual environments are useful for developing a program that you want others to run.
Maximum cringe
*Spyder And yes, it's great, though development has basically stopped which is a shame. It's still an excellent scientific IDE though
I don't know, vim has so many plugins that you might be just fine, but I'll tell you the biggest improvement I noticed switching from Kdevelop to Pycharm: code navigation. I can ctrl+click on a class name and instantly go to its definition, even if it's inside another package. Or I can ctrl+Q and I get a popup with a short documentation of a function. Stuff like that. (It took me a bit to adapt the key bindings and the color scheme to something that I liked, but it was worth it.)
You should definitely use it if you're a beginner. I started with Anaconda and I think it's extremely user-friendly.
Find a project that aligns roughly with your interests (you haven't specified what they are, so I can't provide any further pointers here) and then search for for open issues tagged 'good-first-issue', 'easy' or something similar. &amp;#x200B; There's a small list of good beginner-friendly projects (on GitHub) here to get you started: [https://github.com/MunGell/awesome-for-beginners#python](https://github.com/MunGell/awesome-for-beginners#python)
dstat as an example
Together with curses.
That's awesome! Thanks a lot for the very nice feedback.
That's awesome! Thanks a lot for the very nice feedback.
The math isn't conceptually difficult but it's not something you're going to come up with on your own. Thankfully linear programming has been studied to death and problems like this are solvable even for large number of variables. Your problem can be written like this: minimize f(X) such that: A*X &gt;= B In this case `X` is a vector of the number of fruits, `f(X)` is the sum of calories, `A` is the nutrients per food item, and `B` is the nutrient target. Any integer linear programming solver will spit out "5,1,24" for the constraint set you posted more or less instantly. &gt; PS3: I think this optimalization problem is called " multidimensional knapsack problem" Integer linear programming is a much better fit.
Anaconda is pretty cool,I prefer to use atom for python.Atom is very interesting then anaconda.Atom is lighter,attractive,and easy to usable.But,if you need Jupiter notebook then install anaconda.
Everyone does it. Here's another example: https://www.eater.com/2019/3/20/18274523/instgram-bot-free-food-nyc
A really fun project! I experimented with voice a while back, I remember finding this really good 'scottish accent' voice, that was so good I had a hard time telling it was automated.
I make project for my school, and everything should be written by yourself (lol), (btw for personal use only) &amp;#x200B; And I found library librosa (audio processing), and its possible for example if something could change from: librosa.display(y) &amp;#x200B; to all swap that calling to source methods and class?
I do that in Spyder all the time, using the #%% cell blocks. Super useful, and I much prefer the Spyder environment where you can have a terminal and a variable explorer.
You can catch the exception with a `try/except` clause: ``` try: stuff = int(input()) except ValueError: print("There's an error!") raise ```
This is a solution (there are more sophisticated ways to do this but anyway) try: value = int(input()) except ValueError as error: print("input value must be a number)
Why not, x = input() try: x=int(x) except ValueError: print("Enter number")
Anaconda is easier, not greater. If I want someone at work to run a script I've written, I'll get them to download anaconda first.
whoa, he's... a moron. what the hell? all I know about this guy is that his book is a popular recommendation (I think), and then the first thing I read is... that. how?
You could potentially just copy and paste the source code for the library into your project, but that won't make you pass the assignment.
Long time ago you had to on Windows. Now that the Windows scientif python stack is actually installable, it's no longer required.
hey dude, don't give up. I can help you finish the assignment. Where can we have a text conversation? Discord? Skype? Just hit me up! pm me.
Thank you so much I really appreciate that!
I started as a beginner installing from scratch. I wanted to know what stuff I needed when I needed it and do the research to install it (some stuff were not as straightforward as pip install). I now could not be happier to just download anaconda e have 95% of my needs already installed and running as soon as the installer is done. Including jupyter notebook which I work with almost exclusively.
I've sent a PM. I can also hit you up on discord
Jesus Christ, use some periods. Or at the very least some semicolons. Really, what good do you think your bot is really doing if you don't have the quality content to attract people without it in the first place?
I wrote my masters project without it. I have heard of it as being 'all of it in a box' thing but I like things simple. I habe never felt its need so far.
If you are beginner and you want to learn Python itself, I recommend you to start with vanilla Python and learn its infrastructure like virtualenv, pip, tox, etc. If you are beginner and you want to learn AI/ML and use Python as a tool only, then Anaconda would be a better choice.
I haven’t looked too closely at pipenv. It was very new around the time that I started using conda.
I swear to god I was in /r/EliteDangerous for a moment there...
Go find librosa, look at the source code, copy it. But in saying that I can't imaging a school project is expecting you to produce code at a level on par with a package that processes audio. I think your teacher will see through it when you can't explain any of it.
That way works just fine if the main thing you’re using the venv for is package version management and you don’t have lots of different projects with different package versions. But if you are, for example, using other features of venv like setting environment variables for secrets, or are expecting to deploy to a production box targeting a specific Python version or library version, venv gives you more power to ensure all elements of your dev environment match your deploy environment.
I use it because I manage a large user base that is involved in high energy physics research. Managing every package that every user might need separately is pretty nightmarish, Anaconda provides 99% of what my users tend to need.
As many have already mentioned, a try/except is your simplest option. here's my example that will loop until the user enters a valid number def get_int(): try: user_input = int(input('Enter a number: ')) print('{} is a number!'.format(user_input)) except ValueError: print('That was not a number!') get_int() get_int()
4 spaces everyone. Indent code with 4 spaces to make it show like code on Reddit.
Or if you want to run your analysis, say, on your own PC as well as on a computing cluster and you want to ensure that you have the exact same set of packages running on both.
Personally, I’m failing to understand why installing packages on your own is a problem. Takes seconds.
Python is a programming language, not an IDE.
There is also intel-numpy in pip: https://pypi.org/project/intel-numpy/ And also intel-scikit-learn and intel-tensorflow
This looks great! Any downsides so far?
Boy, the python 2 part is essential. I discover it the hardway, thought.
Yeah, it's rough. But the SharePlum package makes the process pretty painless on the python side.
that was sarcasm if you didnt notice bruh -\_\_-

I started with Anaconda, but I ended up having to switch when it gave me problems with upgrading packages. For environment setup, I would recommend learning venv. Once you can set up and activate virtual environments with venv, you can pip install any packages you want in each environment.
yes, but seeing the code above its much clearer to understood insted of just making import
but maybe there some way to do that automaticly?
No, and even if there were such a way, it would have cause you to fail the assignment.
But new media must either conform to the default or be explicit about supporting obsolote tech
My issue with pipenv (I still use it) is that sometimes generating a profile.lock hangs for forever, which when I looked into it seemed to be a known issue they couldn't really fix. However if you use it using only the Pipfile (--skip-lock) it works pretty well. I've used conda too, I dislike that it tries to automatically resolve dependency issues sometimes.

There is a typo in his right pocket.
Absolutely not. You should register on their site for a subdomain (like [moonpad.ddns.net](https://moonpad.ddns.net)), then you should configure your router ((if you're on ADSL then something like [192.168.1.1](https://192.168.1.1) or [192.168.0.1](https://192.168.0.1) will bring you address of that router) for that service.

You forgot a use case, what about if I have to develop for multiple versions of python (2.7 and 3.x)

Does pipenv allow you to control which version of python? Because you get that on conda

I'm not a beginner, but I'd highly recommend going with anaconda for a beginner. Often, as a beginner, you'll be looking at a cool script and try it out only to find you've got to install new packages. Why bother when anaconda has already installed most of what you'll ever need. Not to mention, it comes with a nice editor and other goodies like Jupyter (which you should learn).
Can you elaborate on the types of problems you ran into? Have you used conda environments? If so, can you say what you like/dislike relative to venv?
"Just about" - did IT stop you? We [at Anaconda] are very good at talking with corporate IT to enable &amp; empower Python data scientists within their business environments.
I find the contextlib module to be very well written. https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/3.7/Lib/contextlib.py
What system are you installing on? What kinds of packages? Anything with compiled binaries can be quite tricky to build correctly, in a way that is reproducible down the road. Even webdevs run into pain with e.g. crypto libraries, and PyData/SciPy users tend to have vastly more complex dependency chains.
Oof. Use `six`, `from future import ...` and sadly no awesome features like a sync/await and Pathlib for you.
Awesomeness
These types of posts make me sad. If you don’t have anything you want to create, why are you learning to program anyway?
Here's another way, without using "try/execpt": while True: user_input = input("Input a number:") if not user_input.isnumeric(): print("That was not a number, try again.") else: break
Then anaconda isn't a tool for you.
It depends on how much you need to use packages that depend on lower-level native libraries, and how much control you have over your deployment environment. If you are skilled enough to constantly build Python numerical libraries from source, and manage underlying UNIX/BSD dependencies via an OS package manager, then you're probably good to go without Anaconda/miniconda. But I will caution that even for skilled devs, there are occasionally packages that are really difficult to build in a way that's compatible with other libraries - especially as more of the data science libraries use LLVM, and libstdc++ complexities start rolling through the underlying libs.
I don't think that's necessarily unpopular, just particular to your use case. Others may need to collaborate on and share code or host it on a separate machine, which is made much easier when you have a consistent, reproducible environment.
Definitely not.
Because, my anaconda dont want none unless you got buns, hon.
For my projects I use vanilla python, but being able to pyenv over to an anaconda install to test something quickly (e.g. a labmate’s code or a question on /r/learnpython) is way nicer than having to create a venv and install packages I’m going to delete in 5 minutes. Doesn’t help that I use pipenv which can be a bit slow.

For a lot of data viz people, they are not interested in managing environments and installing all of the sci dev libraries can be a pain in the ass. Anaconda allows them to focus on data viz and not environment management.

Have you contacted your seminar leader to ask about the API key error and how you've tried resetting it multiple times but it keeps having the same error?
The recursion used here makes it possible for the user to crash the entire Python interpreter if they enter enough non-numbers. I admit it's not too likely, but why open your code to a Denial Of Service attack when it's not necessary?
I keep getting this error,. {'cod': 401, 'message': 'Invalid API key. Please see [http://openweathermap.org/faq#error401](http://openweathermap.org/faq#error401) for more info.'} I don't know what to do?
I havn't yet I wanted to try as many other options to fix it as possible before contacting a staff member.
I can get that code to work using python 3.7. Generally it's also a good idea to include the error you're getting. Not sure if this sub has rules on how to ask questions but I'm sure stackover flow has some guidelines. Either way, happy to help

Because I'm not going to code out an entire menu system with validation and error handling for someone's beginner question. It's just an example.
You might want to ask this in /r/learnpython. I would guess that you aren't finding what you're looking for because that's not the purpose of a linter - a linter is meant to find potential errors in your code, poor style, that sort of thing. I'm not sure exactly what you *should* be looking for, though. I had a quick look for "python optimizer" and there's a dated project that looked to rewrite code based on some efficiency rules. If I had to guess I'd say what you're looking for may not exist for python, since that's not really what python is about: it's about usability over complexity. Typically the mindset is going for readable code over complex statements, even if that means not being 100% efficient. Otherwise, those lingers are all about style and code smells, preventing bugs
I downloaded pycharm straight from the website homepage. I have gone onto settings and its Python 3.7 I have a feeling its to do with my api key and the website im using?
You can try pasting the url directly in your browser too. It might sound obvious but the error indicates that you're not using a valid API key when making the actual request. It also sometimes help to describe the steps you're taking that results in the error. You might even discover the bug along the way.
Is the "appID" you pass in the url your api key? If it is, first, I'd request a new one since it's now out on the internet. Second, I used that exact appID and it worked for me. I can do some digging but the code you posted is working for me.
Yeh i'll request a new one... So bloody odd that it seems to be working for everyone but ME. Thank you
That is really odd. You're sure that you haven't changed your api key at all in your code? That code you posted above is the current state of your code right?

Only use lambda, map, and filter. Never used reduce
Am working on a flask app for the farm (in the netherlands) of my parents in law where the employees can register there hours. It is to replace a paper system. Am excited about it because it is actually going to be used and will be a huge approvement. Therefor I am thinking about adding some pytest tests.. how hard would that to setup?
They need tests, it not about the initial changes it's about the changes 2 months from now when the dev who didn't write the code adds a feature.
&gt; Everyone does it. And?
Generally if you want CLI control over the whole Screen, you want to look at curses

Pygame all the way. I took a course in XNA C# graphics library, and pygame can be used to recreate the exact same settings.
Sure, the approach is fine. Assuming you want to _remain_ an amateur. But seriously, no you can’t write good software without tests. That isn’t to say you can’t write software that works, even well, but good software is _known_ to work, and, absent a new version passing all the old tests the addition of a new feature invalidates that knowledge. Heed not the advice of amateurs and intermediates if it contradicts professionals and experts.
Not at a computer to check but also try subtracting 1.0 from the result. Think of it this way (not technically how it works but gives you an idea and with 1e-16 being an approximation machine precision) 1 +/- 1e-16 vs 0 +/- 1e-16 In the first, the uncertainty is a tiny, tiny percent of the number. In the second, the uncertainty is an infinite percent of the number
Haha weird! Well let's hope it keeps working then! Hope the rest of the assignment goes well!

This is my first web project and primarily built for educational purposes. Any constructive feedback would be appreciated; DMs &amp; emails are welcome.
Probably not in a big way. There are two related problems environments could solve. First is that you are working on two projects that are really unrelated to each other and have inconsistent requirements. (Like if you're doing everything new in Python 3 but also occasionally work on something you wrote in Python 2). The second would be if you were trying to share code or get it working in multiple places (e.g. on your computer for development but you also run it on a server where others use). &amp;#x200B; If none of that applies to your situation then they aren't going to change your life probably. But if you were ever interested the basics are pretty easy and can open some door. But use version control if you aren't doing it!!!!
TDD != having tests; you cannot TDD without tests, but you can have tests without TDD.
Such a pain in the ass, thanks for yours and everyone else's help! I'm sure it wont be long until I make another post asking how do to things as i've just read that I need to make this a web application... God help me another thing I have to learn how to do.

I've only been playing around with python for like, the past two weeks, and have been working on a little text based game. I'm on version 4 now, about to start version 5. I post to r/learnpython between each version, get a few tips, and build everything from scratch again.
Read some of the subreddit history, this question is asked at least once a week
Thank you.
Thank you all.
If you don't write tests, you'd better have a QA team that has been blessed by the gods. If not, something will be missed during integration testing, and you're going to be in a WORLD of pain trying to get that release out.
Why?
Never had a reason to use reduce. The other I use pretty often.
Are you in Data Science? Are you building a small toy program? Maybe use Anaconda. Are you building a production data pipeline? Are you using spark? Are you on a team? Do you do any sort of standard development? Don't use Anaconda. Why? Anaconda is its own ecosystem. If you can stay within that ecosystem, your life will be happy. Most of the examples I gave above extend outside of the Anaconda ecosystem and will cause a lot of unexpected issues.
Great work, keep it up! I’d love to see an update if you add any new features!
I use conda because I can control the python version. Can't do that with virtualenv. Sometimes I need python 3.6, 3.5 or 3.7.
Yes that should cover most of them, although it doesn't quite explain *what* the conversion functions actually are (even if most of them are pretty trivial: "2" =&gt; 2, "blah" =&gt; #VALUE!) There's also arrays: SUM({1,2,3}) which have some fun rules (broadcasting and lifting and such that you'd be familiar with in languages that do similar things with matrices like MATLAB)
Or any other ide yes
Okay, I think I understand
Right. Most of the cases can be dealt with using comprehensions (or maps and filters), but there are some rare cases where reduce is justified.
3-5 years of experience is pretty far from a "junior" position to me. I'd expect you to be pretty competent by yourself if you've been working in the field for that long.
Puganeshwary. Just recently got into it but it can do a lot with a bit of effort
Yup, there are now .whl files for most packages. But you have to make sure you install the mkl version of numpy.
Not related to your script, but that sort of stuff usually happens when your driver messes up waking the device from a sleep state. Try disabling power saving on your wireless adapter, or updating the drivers manually.
Yes, I completely agree. That is solidly into the realm of intermediate developer. If someone is still a junior dev at that point, either someone is holding them back or they don't have the skillsets needed for the industry.
Yeah not saying there isn’t just haven’t needed to use it
&gt; Spyder Does it finally have some proper code completion/ IntelliSense? Because writing code without it, even as someone experienced is quite annoying.
I use pyenv for my base install and direnv to manage environments. You create a folder for your project, type direnv allow and it creates a virtualenv inside that folder which is activated every time you cd into the directory. The whole thing takes seconds, I kind of dislike pipenv.
Note that using arrays like the one in the SUM are already supported, broadcasting not so much. I'll get there, you're giving me lots of material.
I'm vientre working on a WiFi pentesting tool. Right now I have two libraries that use docopt to parse command line arguments from a command's help string and exposes a class that accepts those as args and provides an async context manager (and uses async subprocesses). https://github.com/XayOn/pyrcrack https://github.com/XayOn/pyreaver Upon those I've built an api with aiohttp and swagger: https://github.com/XayOn/pyroscript It implements reaver, aircrack and wifiphiser
I actually disabled power saving on it last night in device manager in hopes that it would help, but I woke up this morning and my internet was disconnected again so I'm not sure if that fixed it. I have to give it more time to see if that helped. Sometimes the connection will drop out once or twice a day, sometimes it can do it like 5 times. It's only been doing this for about a week and I've been living here for several months. I don't know if my WiFi card is giving out or what. Tried to find an update for it and couldn't. Thanks for the response I appreciate it.
What model of Wi-Fi card is that?
&gt; Processing Unicode Data Just use Python 3, in my opinion. It saves a lot of headache when dealing with Unicode.
Anaconda is a great way to share code within a team on certain projects. You can quickly make sure that everyone (including those who are less skilled) are running the same environment and have access to the same packages.
If "a cloud" is a Linux server, look into systemd timers or cron. If it's a Windows server, use the builtin Task Scheduler.
TDD isn't important, but writing tests is essential for future refactoring or addition of new features. TDD is just one methodology that attempts to enforce test coverage, but like many methodologies it is closer to a religion for some people.
Well it's not as good as VSCode (though nothing is) but it's got inline hinting at least.
Word of warning if you use any exe bundler (pyinstaller, py2exe, etc), Anaconda can/will bundle in ALL packages, not just the ones you've imported, into the final executable (which ends up being ~200MB for small projects). Most people don't compile Python like that, so it's a pretty limited issue. It did caused me a huge headache though.
This is exactly the reason I stopped using Spyder as well.
[TP Link Archer T4U](https://www.tp-link.com/us/home-networking/usb-adapter/archer-t4u/)
I mean, that book came out many years ago when most code that I personally would encounter on github or whatever was still in python 2. Python 3 has come a long way since then in terms of being the vast majority of new code and also its obvious benefits over python 2.
Then it's a conflict between python 2 and 3, so depending on which one you are using you should use pip or pip3
I see you've never built a C++ library.
I did on two occasions. But… Am I missing something? This is the Python subreddit.
The last driver update was late last year and I just updated it so we'll see how it goes lol.
The value of writing tests starts to compound when the project becomes large and complex, and when there are more than a few developers working on it. &amp;#x200B; Another often forgotten valuable use case for having tests and a CI environment is when you bump the versions of the project dependencies. Without tests, this is a scary endeavor.
unfortunately you seemed to have danced around the real reason for using anaconda but not explicitly stating it. Here it comes... different projects demand different things, some packages are written for python 2 while some are written for only python 3, not everything out there is maintained all the time. say you found a package that parses pdf to excel or something, if it happens to be written only for python 2, you will have to remove all python 3 from your machine, install python 2, reinstall all the necessary packages again....etc. also if you break something you may have to manually do this all over again. this is where anaconda comes to rescue, you can create a virtual environment tailored for this particular project, if something goes south, you can simply delete an environment and create a new one, if you are working on multiple projects two in py3 one it py2, anaconda will happily let you create different environments. this is the main purpose of anaconda IMO. it allows you to create and destroy multiple sandboxes.
Even accounting for when he wrote his book, the book itself is not a good learning resource.
Hey I think this might also help you https://github.com/prompt-toolkit/python-prompt-toolkit It even has a full screen section in the docs: https://python-prompt-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/stable/pages/full_screen_apps.html
In some companies, the IT department will block you from installing your own dependencies. Or, since large corporations move very slowly, you might have to work on a system that only has Python2, without being able to install Python3, and from personal experience sometimes you are able to install anaconda and have access to Python3. Like it or not, you are not always 100% in charge of your development environment, and you may not always be able to just install dependencies as you need them
&gt; Is TDD really important No, but… &gt; can you get away with simply testing code without writing tests? Also no to this. Emphatic NO. NO NO NO. TDD is not absolutely vital. It's a helpful tool, and will result in *usually* cleaner code, but at the costs of spending a lot more time building your automated tests. I consider myself more of a pragmatists, so I write tests, but I don't do TDD. My thinking around it is this: I want to be as lazy as I possibly can. Manually testing is a lot of work. And I'm lazy. So I write automated tests because I hate testing, because testing is a lot of work. So if I'm writing a new code module, I'll often write a sketch of how I think it should work, then I'll whip up a unit test to confirm that's how it works. This means I don't have to think very hard (lazy, remember?) about how that code is going to interact with other components. I can just work on one tiny piece, and make sure it does what I want, then tie it to other pieces. I don't have to run the whole program, because over time, my whole program is going to get pretty big and pretty complicated, so it's nice to be able to just use bits and pieces. Do you need to adopt a TDD ideology? No. Do you need automated tests? ABSOLUTELY YES. Do you need 100% code coverage? Nah. Is it possibly better to have 100% code coverage? Sure. But even 10% code coverage is better than 0%, and while I do think there are diminishing returns on the effort/reward axis, using the Pareto principle, 80% of your bugs are going to come from 20% of your code, so even a relatively small quantity of unit tests are going to drastically improve your code quality.
Automatic testing is critical for code quality. For example: optimizing without automatic testing is really not recommended. So is refactoring. The larger the project, the greater the value of automatic testing. For instance - the developers you mentioned test **their** code locally, but do they test the other parts of the project to make sure they didn't break anything? When other people add new features, will their code get tested to make sure it did not break due to the change? Unfortunately, the answer is inevitably no.
you can get away without doing it, and it unfortunately seems to be the norm. TDD is only there to make a dev team's life easier. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; If you write tests that arent useful, or if people dont run the tests while developing, or you dont have some sort of jenkins pipeline to run tests on pull requests... not very useful. if you are doing TDD just to say you're doing it, then yes its probably not worth your time. &amp;#x200B; Done right it can bring a lot of order to an otherwise chaotic project, but typically this requires A LOT of effort from the more senior developers on the team to set standards, set up proper environments for testing, and help others get started write tests.
Reason for using "response" instead of "return" ?
I would say no since he has a new book for python 3. At the time the thinking was probably that python 2 was everywhere and the legacy label was farther off. Zed says a lot of shit that may or may not make any sense but take it with a grain of salt and filter out what doesn't jibe with you.
The package manager just wouldn't populate the list of packages to upgrade. Never figured out how to get it working. I ended up just reinstalling the whole thing every time I wanted to upgrade a package. You have to do that anyways if you want to upgrade your Python version in Anaconda. As of Python version 3.7.2 (which has some Windows-breaking bugs- use 3.7.3 instead), venv no longer requires you to rebuild all of your virtual environments to upgrade Python. So, that's a pretty big advantage over Anaconda, now.
I used to do the full install. But after gaining some experience knowing what I use and seeing the install size. I have moved to miniconda. I have a script that installs the latest version and then installs the packages that I used most often.

How are they both cloud severs? XD
What do you mean by "they"?
I mean as as my knowledge goes they are localhost? No?
Who are "they"?
As far as I know, anaconda is the only way you can have multiple versions of python properly installed on your machine at the same time. For TensorFlow, we need python 3.6 and the latest is 3.7. Sure, there may be some tricks to get both of those python versions running at the same time. But anaconda makes it really easy. Also, in my opinion, searching and installing packages are a way lot more easier using conda, rather than say, using pip.
&gt; say you found a package that parses pdf to excel or something, if it happens to be written only for python 2, you will have to remove all python 3 from your machine That seems like you're doing something very wrong if that's why you choose Anaconda. I have never had to uninstall Python just to use another version of Python. Anaconda is fine if it works for you, but vanilla Python handles this scenario just fine too.
This thread hurts me emotionally
It's fine. OP's native language might not be English, but we can figure it out.
Also impressive is conda-gorge, which builds all packages with the same compiler and environment, so that packages don’t break ABI compatibility.
I actually meant more the way it was written, like the vague references to a supposed Python 3 propaganda machine and the truly bizarre "DEAR HATERS:" info box. I just can't believe anyone who writes like that is not an idiot. Maybe he wrote a great book anyway! Weirder things have happened.
If we're thinking about the same thing, response was meant for internal uses in that definition, not to be displayed. I could output the result of response by using return, but I wanted to store it into a variable so that I can use if "'Destination host unreachable' in response:". The first part of the script checks if the network is disabled, then it uses that part to confirm that the pings were successful. If you have a suggestion on how it could be improved feel free to let me know. Like I said I'm newer to python so I'm willing to take criticism on it and advice.
But yeah to your point each OS has some sort of task scheduler. Unless you are talking about something like AWS Lambda. For that I still think they have a native task scheduler
Wait, what's wrong with our customers testing our code?
It's installed and working fine - thank you - I just can't use the conda update/install. I'm not going to go into our corporate security in a public forum, but if I run into a brick wall I'll get in touch!
Lots of the most powerful and popular python libraries have C++ under the hood. The big ones not so much, but the less-supported such libraries are an absolute nightmare to build, and conda is basically the only answer.
Anaconda is a collection of pre-installed python packages with its own custom package manager and a configured virtual environment. I don't recommend it to newbies. Learn how to use pip instead (python's default package manager) and install the packages you really need. That way you get more understanding of python and the packages you are using. Also, Anaconda's file size is really heavy, 500mb+ I guess while python is 20mb.
Can you point me to where I can learn about creating tests?
Because I can figure out how to install it. Simply setting things up so that you can use a programming language is probably the biggest obstacle most people face to learning. Anaconda removes that barrier completely.

Oh wow, I wasn't aware of any of that. He's starting to sound like a bit of a nutjob.
As the bot has told you before, this kind of question is better suited for /r/learnpython Also the feature combination your TA is referring to might be Principle Component Analysis (usually the default way is by singular value decomposition) or some other dimensionality reduction technique
l1 = range(10) l1 outputs range(10) instead of the list. I understand this tutorial is python2 but how would you do it in python3
Please no spamming!
Yes, according to the python developpers it is easier to read a for loop instead of the reduce function
For example, `pip install pandas` will fail on Windows without some very specific C++ compiler packages installed on the machine. And even when they're there, it doesn't take "seconds," it takes several minutes to build.
Ay! That's rude.
Maybe it is my phone, but the videos are such low resolution that I can't even see the code on the first video.

*slowpoke meme* Hey guys, check out Python 2! It's really neat.
I use lambda as a key function and that's about it. Is there anything the others get you that can't be done with comprehensions?
Electric sheep look.... different. Very cool!
I used to use Anaconda to avoid VCVARSAL.BAT errors when I was developing on corporate managed Windows. It wasn't full proof, but it happened a lot less.
 list(range(10))
thank you sir
You can, yeah. Although it won't download it for you without pyenv installed, I don't think.
Pipenv does not handle half the issues you mentioned, you cannot pin a Python version and you definitely don't get a full dependency solver.
&gt; because I want to have a complete control over both dev and production environments Could you explain how conda gets in the way of that? Using the OS package manager gives you a lot **less** flexibility and control.
Looks good!
Even if you know your way around unix and cold + venv and pip, a massive advantage of Anaconda over vanilla python is that it takes care of potential dependency a library may have. Best nightmare that comes to mind : installing scrapy on a company machine locked so good luck . Anaconda took care of it.
There's some background you need to know for this question. Python packages tend to be distributed on pypi.org (which is where `pip` installs packages from). Python being a cross-platform interpreted language, originally these were *source* distributions: you'd just download a bunch of python code and let your local interpreter figure everything out from text. However, a lot of the most powerful and popular python libraries, like `numpy`, use compiled languages like C and C++ under the hood. Pip would download these libraries, and try to compile them. But that had a lot of dependencies on your OS: do you even have the right compiler? A lot of the compilation and runtime dependencies had wildly different installation processes depending on your OS, and it took a long time to install very common packages. Conda took the approach of allowing people to upload not only their source distribution, but also any steps required to build that source into something usable, on a fairly controlled operating system. That meant that you could upload a pure-C++ package, and have conda packages depend on that conda-ised version of that dependency. Therefore, you could isolate your package from the OS a lot more, and install dependencies in a much more sane, batteries-included way. Because you were downloading a *binary* (pre-compiled) distribution, it was also a lot faster to install e.g. `numpy`. Because of the speed increase, it became pretty common to use all over. Later (I think), PyPI allowed the upload of binary distributions - called wheels (the name python is a reference to Monty Python; PyPI was originally called the cheese shop; therefore wheel of cheese). However, you were still constrained to using it for python packages (albeit ones which could also include compiled libaries) - this meant that it doesn't replicate conda's ability to package non-python dependencies, because it doesn't intend to. So if you're using a library with a lot of such dependencies, conda is the way to go: packages installed via pip may still depend on your OS having some libraries available. However, its dependency resolution step is MUCH slower than pypi's, so the speed gains which were previously gained by using conda has been erased. I, personally, transitioned my own environment and a few open source libraries over to using conda for their testing, to speed up the build, and then transitioned them back a few years later for the same reason. Furthermore, anaconda includes packaged a MATLAB-like IDE (spyder), a tool for separating python environments (`conda env`), and a tool for installing different versions of python all in your user space rather than relying on your system python. Without anaconda, those are all different tools. It's batteries-included. However, given PyPI is the default way of getting packages, and that's not going to change, there are good reasons to avoid anaconda. Relying on it to build your projects basically "poisons" them: downstream users must also use conda. `pip` is much faster so long as your dependencies have uploaded binary distributions. In my experience, pip has been a lot more stable than conda since releasing wheels. It's a lot simpler to set up remote testing, and it's much more compatible with IMO indispensable tools like `tox`. Basically, conda became necessary because C/C++/whatever development and deployment is a hot mess, and for some reason that's the problem of the python community. Unless you know that it's necessary for your project, don't use it. Modern languages which can/should replace C/etc., like rust, do not have this problem and so it's very easy to build python libraries on top of them.
for anyone following along with python 3 # reduce move to functools module import functools l5 = functools.reduce(lambda x,y : x*y, l4) l5 --- # map, reduce, etc. iterable objects and not lists. # so if you need a list you have to convert. l1 = range(10) l2 = range(10,20) add_2_nos = lambda x,y : x + y l3 = map(add_2_nos, l1, l2) l4 = filter(lambda x : x &gt; 15, l3) #print(l4) prints &lt;filter object at 0x7f2e300c9da0&gt; print(list(l4)) #print [16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28] as expected
To diff you must have A and B. One must be the control and one must best the test You can use that same function, but you have to choose a string to be the baseline for comparison Ex: A:B A:C A:D

Nope. They are basically built in common generators.

I have used Anaconda on both. Windows and Linux and mostly the experience is same if you don't have to use any other tool to interact with it. If you do, Linux is best because most of the configurations/environmental variables get set when you install the tool using package manager and it just works. In case of windows, the entire installation, version matching and env variable setup is required to be done manually which is error prone. Also, the large community and resources on the internet to help you out are mostly Linux too. So that's another advantage

no forced updates like windows. windows 10 also has a lot of privacy issues people arent comfortable with, that you wont find on linux. i still use windows but its things like this that make me want to switch. theres also a million different distros to choose from instead of just windows 10 or osx, so you can find one that fits your personal needs. &amp;#x200B; however while linux is better imo, windows makes things alot easier. its kinda like the difference in a manual and auto car. one has more control, the other is simpler to use.
The pros I can think of off the top of my head: -Linux is lighter weight. Less RAM and CPU intensive. -More intuitive command line interface. Just my opinion -Linux lends itself to scripting with many built in compilers for different languages. -Aesthetic is nicer with some distros. Ubuntu looks awesome. -Security
Let me start with the basics: it is free.
RegEx are so powerful and yet so hated. I always try to use them whenever I can, with python they are super easy to understand and use
Or even when the same dev who did write it goes back months later. I've had code bases with no tests and code bases that I'm very confident in my own tests. The sheer stress relief of knowing I can move fast and not break stuff is 100% worth writing the tests up front.
Eclipse has been serving me fine, and with support for other languages its amazing what it can do.... and its free
Hahaha this is true and always a bonus but I was hoping to understand what the benefits of "building from source" are and the various trade offs of the different packages
I like the scripting better in python though. Just one language, and always the same across different distros.
- windows CMD/terminal sucks, Unix terminal (Mac, Linux and others) is better - Linux is free - Linux is lightweight, bloatware free - installing packages on Linux is much easier and quicker (snap, apt, apt-get, dpk, pacman etc) plus they are updated automatically - production servers usually run on Linux, so it is easier to test and deploy your project from Linux/mac machine with experience in bash commands Windows tries to keep up with Linux since few years, by wsl, Unix tools (SSH and few other), but still it can cause a big headache for cs/ds projects.
I have a feeling I know why they're so maligned: its almost impossible to tell, at a glance, what a given regex *does* unless you have that particular language's regex syntax memorized. I do agree that they're quite potent, but I also agree with other folks in that they're an extreme pain in the ass, especially if they start going wrong.
Junior dev? Holy crap. It's like when I tried to to get my first credit card and kept getting denied cause I didn't have credit.
just stick to good old fashion testing.
&gt; Regular Expressions Made Easy &gt; 15+ videos Yeah, sounds about right.
This is true to some extent. Alot of the different 'versoons' of Regex contain very similar syntax for character classes and such.
RTFM
Take a look at https://npyscreen.readthedocs.io or http://urwid.org
It's not owned by Microsoft or Apple.
My personal reason for switching from windows to Linux is almost entirely due to my preference for the terminal over windows’ command line. The lightweight nature of Linux, the freedom from forced updates, FOSS, etc. are all icing on that cake.
&gt; what the benefits of "building from source" are Most people never do this unless you have a good reason, even on Linux. In fact, on most Linux distros, installing software is as easy as opening up the software center or typing `apt install anaconda` or whatever. The fundamental benefit of the UNIX environment is that everything is able to inter-operate through the command line whereas on Windows most programs are totally siloed. Therefore there is a huge ecosystem of tools that can be strung together to do complex things simply. A great example is RTL-SDR airplane tracking. rtl-fm to receive signals plus dump1090 to decode them plus other tools to filter, record, et cetera and then a tiny bit of Python to plot them. Took me an afternoon to set up what would have been a big project without access to those tools. Basically, everyone writes everything for Linux and it all works together, so you get hooked into a huge ecosystem.
Yes, small things here and there. It's a fairly new project after all. But they are mostly inconveniences that can be overcome, unlike in the case of Pipenv. Also, Poetry is being developed at quite a fast pace, heading towards 1.0.
Thanks, and yeah I definitely want to figure it out myself, struggling through if necessary so far I have this: CRED = '\\033\[32m' CEND = '\\033\[0m' print(CRED + "a" + CEND) CRED = '\\033\[91m' CEND = '\\033\[0m' print(CRED + "b" + CEND) Which basically just prints the letters "a" and "b" in color I found another block of code that seems like it is closer to what I am looking for and I am trying to dissect it to make sense of it (from [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48302284/how-to-color-text-by-character-in-python#](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48302284/how-to-color-text-by-character-in-python#)) &amp;#x200B; import matplotlib.colors as mcolors from matplotlib import cm import numpy as np from IPython.core.display import display, HTML def format\_chars(chars,numbers): numbers = np.array(numbers).astype(float) norm = mcolors.Normalize(vmin=-1, vmax=1) cmap = cm.RdYlGn colors = cmap(norm(numbers)) hexcolor = \[mcolors.to\_hex(c) for c in colors\] letter = lambda (c,l): "&lt;span style='color:{};'&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;".format(l,c) text = " ".join(list(map(letter, zip(chars,hexcolor)))) text = "&lt;div style='font-size:14pt;font-weight:bold;'&gt;" + text + "&lt;/div&gt;" display(HTML(text)) return colors &amp;#x200B; chars = \['a', 'c', 'm', 'e', 't', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'm', 'e'\] vals = \['0.17', '0.062', '0.26', '-0.0799', '-0.449', '-0.746', '-0.812', '-0.844', '-0.865','-0.87'\] &amp;#x200B; col = format\_chars(chars,vals) \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; I tried running the code and got this error: File "/Users/jonathondavis/PycharmProjects/Synesthesia/app.py", line 22 letter = lambda (c,l): "&lt;span style='color:{};'&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;".format(l,c) \^ SyntaxError: invalid syntax \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ I am very new to Python and know some basics but I'm definitely in need of help figuring stuff out, I've been working on this for 2 hours now with little advancement, although I am learning based on what code is working Maybe I can simplify my "program" by first focusing on the numbers 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 and having just those color coded first I'm also curious if I could use solely python for this, using the "input:" function to create the text input box, or if that would be something for javascript Thanks and sorry I am so new to this, I am probably missing simple understandings but I do learn quickly and any help is appreciated

Ok, so install Pandas from scratch. Oh, and use the MKL BLAS libraries. On Windows, please. And I'd also like to have tensorflow as well, can you get that in the couple of seconds you're busy?

I did not know. If I remember correctly, doing this on Linux took a few seconds. I guess as mentioned by many others, I have the privilege of an open environment. Thank you for the info, though. I learned something today.

if you're purely staying in python it doesn't make a big difference, but if you're using platform dependent code and calling down to C libraries you might have a bad time on windows depending on the software I used to have some performance issues with opencv on windows that just didn't occur on linux, and ML software like tensorflow is generally developed and built on linux systems and ends up on windows only later. That aside on linux you also get access to bash, ssh and all the other dev tools and so forth.
Some packages (e.g. celery) only support Linux. Even when Windows is officially supported, developers sometimes don't test as rigorously in Windows and miss breaking bugs. For example, Python v3.7.2 broke the multiprocessing package in Windows virtual environments. They fixed this in 3.7.3. Though, one major advantage of Windows is you may be able to have both: WSL lets you run Linux in Windows. It does have it's own issues (lower i/o performance, unique bugs, etc.), but it works out well for a lot of use cases.
Easy there, Microsoft!
Working on Windows is just PITA, automating things is hard, you can't customize anything to your needs, also the configurations are usually not transparent (I use the same configs on Linux that I move from installation to installation and I don't have to configure the stuff I'm already happy with over and over again), you need to look for software online (Linux has package managment), nothing fits together, you can't combine tools to do something, you need to find a tool that does exactly X. Basically Windows makes you mindlessly repeat the same thing over and over and over again. You need a thousand clicks to do basic stuff a single 5 word command does in an instant.

&gt;windows CMD/terminal sucks, Unix terminal (Mac, Linux and others) is better Powershell is just as capable as bash. &gt; installing packages on Linux is much easier and quicker (snap, apt, apt-get, dpk, pacman etc) plus they are updated automatically Ok, well, stop right there. It is *sometimes* easier to install software using a package manager. It is not universally true that it's easier than installing an exe or an msi. Sometimes, installing software in Linux is ludicrously difficult. Case in point is Sublime. I stopped using Sublime completely on Linux because updating it was an unbelievable hassle. As compared to "just works" on Windows and OSX. And don't forget the shit show that is package management fragmentation - a problem Windows does not suffer from. &gt;production servers usually run on Linux, so it is easier to test and deploy your project from Linux/mac machine with experience in bash commands It's not easier. You can use the exact same tools to deploy to production servers. Apart from the cost, the differences between Windows, OSX and Linux are cosmetic. With the exception of bash, which is a fucking garbage language invented by garbage people, you use all the same CLI tools in exactly the same way on all these systems.
The differences are cosmetic. Some people like Linux better. If you have a windows machine, develop on Windows. It makes very little difference.
Haha it *is* oddly written, but the book itself is actually how I first picked up Python and is overall really good for beginning programmers.
I used to be too lazy to write tests but after I started I dont know how I ever lived without it. Even if you're working solo it's a timesaver.
Ooh ok lol you had me thinking I did something wrong lol. Hopefully that was the *response* you were looking for 😏
Because most servers run Linux and developers like their work environment to be similar to the production environment.
It is more efficient to use the system's native scripting functionality [(Bash is debatably not a full language)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30156349/is-bash-an-interpreted-language) Additionally, while python supports calls to the os via OS and subprocess ect, these require additional packages which scripting OS commands in python bulky and more resource intensive than scripting them with BASH.
Most likely your current working directory is not where the .CSV resides, hence the error.
FWIW, Microsoft has added WSL, meaning you get a native linux command line with the shell of your choice in Windows. Just something to know if you ever need to switch back to Windows.
Good work, keep it going :-)
&gt;It's not easier. You can use the exact same tools to deploy to production servers. As a sysadmin on a server, this is misleading. WHile it is true that you use the tools on both systems, you have a much easier time using them on Linux than on Windows. Having configured servers on both systems, hands-down, it is easier to configure the same program in a linux environment than in a Windows environment.

https://www.debuggex.com I love this website because it has a handy dandy visualizer that honestly makes it super easy to read.
I'm curious which parts of pipenv you couldn't work around? I've definitely had times where I've gotten frustrated, but there hasn't been anything yet that really leaves me stumped.

It makes very little difference? Pah. Sorry, but it makes a HUGE difference. No Discussion. That's a fact
The one you like
For me personally, the two biggest things I've run into are: + Trying to change a single package spec (upgrade version, add a new dep, remove one, etc) is super duper hard. Pipenv tries to update everything at once, instead of one thing at a time, and (especially if you're working on a really old, and/or bleeding-edge stack) it becomes really difficult. Our workaround is to basically use the pipfile *as* a lockfile for lots of things, specifying explicit versions there instead of abstract ones, which kinda... defeats the point of separating the two, unfortunately. However, since we're also transitioning to a private pyPI (pypicloud, to be specific), a different workaround may actually be to control that by just limiting which package versions are available there. It's not the best solution either, but I think possibly slightly better than putting specific versions in the pipfile + The way our build/deploy system works, we distribute all internal code, *including applications,* as prebuilt wheels, instead of distributing the repo. Because the wheel format doesn't inherently know about pipfiles/lockfiles, it doesn't natively include them, and so we have no way of using them to install deps. Our workaround is twofold: first, when initially building and canarying a release candidate, distribute the pipfile/lockfile to the app servers alongside the command to deploy, and second, include the pipfile/lockfile inside the wheel via ``data_files`` in setup.py, so that we can support arbitrary "deploy this version" commands (along with supporting autoscaling the app servers, even if the build/deploy servers go offline) Neither of these workarounds would likely be possible if we didn't have a 100% custom deploy system.
I do find that it’s often much easier to write and read python scripts with even the smallest amount of actual conditionality or flow control to them, though. Bash seems to encourage completely unreadable pipelines, especially if sed, awk, or regexes are involved.
There are some drawbacks with "Fire": * The unintuitive help command: python my-cmd -- --help * The fact that you get all the stack trace in the help or when you entre bad parameters * No way to override help message with your own description * Too much python way to enter list as parameter for CLI: python my-cmd --list-of-string='\["str1","str2"\]' ... &amp;#x200B; Try [https://github.com/epsy/clize](https://github.com/epsy/clize) It's far more mature and as easy than "Fire" to start with.
You don't need TDD. You need tests. I have been guilty of not writing tests, but it always comes back to bite me, and I will always eventually end up adding tests if it's a project that I continue using or maintaining in any significant capacity. I personally don't find TDD to mesh with my style of programming very well. I'm more of a "[README-driven development](https://tom.preston-werner.com/2010/08/23/readme-driven-development.html)" (I write the full README and much of the documentation ahead of time, as if I have completely finished the application) person. I'll write the README, write semi-pseudocode for most of the entire project at once (rather than writing one component at a time) - sometimes writing thousands of lines of pseudocode across dozens of files, then repeatedly iterate on the pseudocode and slowly reify it into real Python. In an ideal case, I write the tests during the pseudocode iteration phase. I think most people don't work this way, but that's what works best for me.
Back in the late 90s drivers for common hardware got built and shipped with most linux distributions. You could get a new machine on the network with naught but the install media. Contrast to windows, where you often has to carry around drivers on floppies or find that rich kid with a CD burner. So now we run Linux on servers and ssh to them remotely and life is good. The graphics subsystems were still mediocre and power management was a joke - plugging a Linux laptop into external monitors was usually an exercise in screaming at X. Contrast with Apple laptops of the era, where the hardware just worked. So now we run OSX on the laptop and run the browser and ssh clients, and life is good.
Privacy. The other day Adobe asked my mac for access to my contacts... wtf for? On linux you set everything up yourself, the code is open source and vetted by the community. People have yet to understand that their information is far more valuable than they think it is. Programming wise, it's just easier to set everything up, you're closer to the system so to speak and you'll learn a whole lot more about computers than by using windows or osx. But yeah... privacy. It's you vs. a multi-billion dollar advertising industry that's becoming increasingly adept at programming your mind and your habits. I need a mac for my work (marketing and graphic design, I work in the industry I hate the most) but all my other computers run Linux.
Fstring are still a "new" feature. Debian comes with python 3.5. And using format / % is not depreciated afaik.
The attention to detail is impressive. Environment-specific docker compose files and a swagger spec, you should be proud, especially for a first project.
Yes. As an example AngularJS uses it massively and JS is dynamically typed also. (I'm not talking about Angular/Typescript)
That certainly does look handy. Might give her a look when I get a chance.
True, but I've been kicked in the dick by the little differences more than once.
This is pretty interesting, so can you give me some examples about in what contexts Linux offers some good tools? For instance when you have to "build from source"?
So when you say scripting can you elaborate a bit on what that means? Sorry I am a bit ignorant to common terminology as most of my coding will be in one py file.
As the bot has told you before, these kinds of questions are better suited for /r/learnpython
Unless you're building your own computer, any OS is free
Ah okay so if I'm understanding correctly script's from different languages are easily compiled and able to interact with one another? Essentially this is done by building a "source" that interweaves different compilers
Again, easier does not mean better. It is true that it is *easier* to do, but it is less computationally efficient.
Ok now this is an interesting answer. So do all scripts run more efficiently in Linux? As they are ae to make easy calls to the C libraries? Moreover what distro would you recommend?
As someone explained "Inversion of control" is not mandatory for dynamic (interpreted) languages. If you have circular dependencies, your code will still run. (with no guarantee on the behaviour as it's probably a sign of bad design) In a statically typed language (often compiled), your code won't compile at all. &amp;#x200B; But dependency injection which is larger than IoC is totally relevant for dynamically typed languages as it allows you to provide different implementations of the dependencies in a particular context (i.e mock in a web container for testing purpose)
That is, of course, nonsense. Let's ignore the premium that Apple charges for its devices (not hating on Apple here. I own and love my MBP). If you buy a machine that has Windows installed, the OEM pays a license fee. Some companies, Dell is one of them, actually give you a discount if you decide no forgo the Windows license. (Dell actually goes a step further: They typically give you a discount of $100 if you go with Ubuntu. Which is quite amazing, since maintaining their Ubuntu support must be quite expensive per user for them.)
They still haven't streamlined the hand-off of data, though. Or have they? It's been a long time since I've used Windows myself. But last time I fiddled with my brother's computer, I checked out WSL and my initial excitement quickly faded once I tried to move data between Windows and the Linux subsystem.
Yeah, I'm with you. Saying that the differences are cosmetic (implying that they are *only cosmetic*) is borderline insane. Other than running on the same hardware and following the same basic paradigms of the machine/human interface (plus supporting many common standards, of course), they couldn't be more different.
Source code is kind of a red herring here. Most people don’t need to interact with source code. The fact that it’s accessible helps, but the real benefit is that making the command line the normal way of getting interacting with your OS means that the toolchain works with minimal friction in standardized ways.
Not compiling from the source part. Now, this is a long time back, my memory is dodgy. One of my friends was trying to use tensorflow instead of in-built theano or keras or it was other way around and windows was giving her a hard time. I repeated this in Linux and it worked like a charm.
cool. uncalled for tangent. been eyeing this beauty called agda.

https://www.obeythetestinggoat.com/
Are A levels not high school? I thought Cambridge was a university.
I should add: you almost never *should* have to build from source, but if you *do*, it works well with all the stuff you installed normally.
How would I go about fixing this?
windows is better for everything except the terminal
So what should I do? Obtain the file listed_companies.csv and place it into the same folder as the py. Script?
Finally figured out how to stream tweets in real time. Made a script to automatically reconnect to the internet if it's disconnected by disabling the wifi adapter and re enabling it. I was having issues staying connected. After updating my wifi adapter driver, I may have fixed the issue lol. Starting to learn more about pygame.
I do that with IFTDT app. Runs smoothly.
That's being generous. For me I need about 45 videos. I'm slow. Lol
But does it look dandy?
Again, look at the error message. It is telling you exactly where it is looking for the file. Looking at the paths in the error message, I can see that there is a folder called "stock_data" in the same location as your .py script, and it's expecting your listed_companies.csv file to be in that folder but it isn't there. Error messages aren't there for nothing. Their entire purpose is to tell you what is wrong with the code and how to fix it.
like how if you're using the `re` module `(?R)` won't work but in the `regex` module it will
they don't necessarily run more efficiently but you don't have to jump through hoops to setup some environment where you have all the tools at hand. It's just a question of support. Say sometimes it happens that you're trying to install something with pip and it fetches a source and it just won't built on windows without some haggling, whereas I've never run into software (in the python or ruby ecosystems say) that built on windows but fail on linux. Distro choice doesn't really matter, just pick any stable LTS release of one of the major well supported one's, because that's what people built software for and its what customers use. Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, Opensuse whatever.
I'm working on a similar project that was in hibernation for a while: Aki, a simple programming language that uses Python and the `llvmlite` library. * GitHub: https://github.com/syegulalp/Akilang * Official blog (still minimal): http://aki.genjipress.com * Quick demo movie (outdated but fun -- this was from the original incarnation of the project) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vZ4oFCFOl8
If I understood correctly, those vehicles were driving on different speed, is it that?

That's fantastic, buddy! Keep it up, one project after another.
First: why Unix? Because it's a design based on principles, with decades of learning used to create new principles. Recent versions of Windows are going through pain points to drag people, kicking and screaming, forward into the 1970s. Second: which Unix? The only choices are: Linux, OS X, or one of the BSDs (OpenBSD, NetBSD, FreeBSD/DragonflyBSD). One of the BSDs would be a reasonable decision, except that none of them have enough market share, so their APIs are full of holes (even though, at least historically, they have enough life that they offer some unique benefits). NetBSD is basically dead. OpenBSD has enough mindshare in the hyper-security-conscious field to avoid being completely dead, but if you aren't using those specific features, it "feels" dead. FreeBSD is alive enough for it to have a mutually living fork, and it is feasible for general use. However, it is still quite rare, and thus you'll have pain interacting with other systems and developers. OS X is ... really weird for a Unix. Despite the fact that at low level, it is closely related to the BSDs, at high level - which every programmer has to deal with - it's arguably even stranger than Windows. Apple also likes to play evil legal games. Add the fact that you're paying twice as much for equivalent hardware, it's easy to decide against this. Linux's design and principles are very obviously alive and growing; the biggest danger is that some particular feature you're interested in evolving will be drowned out by other life. Unlike all other OSes, you can reasonably assume that hardware drivers exist, and software can be made to work. Also, it is what runs the internet, so you're going to be dealing with it anyway; it's silly to run a different OS locally than remotely. It is common for users of other OSes (BSDs in particular) to complain about software that only works on Linux (blaming that software's devs for not bothering with portability). While sometimes true (which isn't necessarily a bad thing!), in my experience its much more common for the other OSes not to even support some fundamental paradigm or option (because they're deadish and haven't evolved to meet the need). OS X is clearly not dead, but the things it's evolving are mostly of the "what the hell is that useful for?" kind. *** The main disadvantage that you'll likely run into from a data-science perspective is that NVidia's proprietary drivers are really shitty from a system-principles (and the company actively sabotages the open-source driver), which sucks because they have the best hardware. With AMD (or Intel, for integrated graphics), you get the same kind of "it just works" driver you get for most other hardware.
oddly I have way more trouble with them in Python than other languages/tools, because the usage is so different.

In addition to what the others have mentioned I think it's easier to customize your work flow. I can make the system adapt to me instead of having to adapt to a system. Downside is that coworkers get lost when they're trying to use my pc.
thanks i hate it
Yea, 966 has been causing problems for me too :( though the second one I haven't had issues with yet (as in, I've noticed the slowness, but it hasn't been a problem). Thanks for the insight!
Thanks for the feedback. I have not, but I will definitely check that post out.
For a one off thing, maybe. For something serious, I would use argparse or similar.

https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/whats-new-for-wsl-in-windows-10-version-1903/ That being said, it's pretty rare that I ever need to transfer stuff between windows and wsl. My dev work happens in WSL, and my windows work stays in windows.
Love it!
This is long but if you have time: Would this be a good tool for what I want? I'd like any Twitter user to be able to tweet "@mybotname &lt;parameter&gt;" And get a response back from my bot "@requestinguser &lt;response based on input&gt;" This would ideally be always searching for the tweet. Just not too sure where to begin with this and I'm wondering if your framework would be useful here. Thanks!!!
If I’m going to be “kicked in the dick” I’d prefer it to be by a little thing.
2.7 tkinter python
We have an ML algorithm at work that detects something like 4000+ images a second using the Darknet neural network, which is GPU supported. Might be a better option? https://pjreddie.com/darknet/
&gt;That's not a function of Linux, but the user. I would still say that is a function of Linux. Nobody installs drivers for fun, and this is clearly not an issue on Windows.
Powershell can go to hell.
Yes maybe, but the neural network is already set up but I'm looking for a library that can replace OpenCV especially the template matching function. The values that I can calculate out of the location from the template matches are going through the neural network.m, so basically the neural network only gets numbers.
We've used OpenCV as well and it was quite fast, moving to Darknet allowed for networked gpu power. Here is a demo of opencv working on a live video for car detection [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLs\_0obPh74](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLs_0obPh74) so I'm thinking there might be an inefficiency in your script somewhere, where it's locking up?
3-5 years is entry level according to most HR people. Maybe a job description is why they were asking.
*With respect to Python* on Linux vs Windows, I've encountered several Python packages that compile native code for speed, and it's much more effort to get the compiler and libraries working on Windows.
[https://www.codepile.net/pile/mG9Pa14L](https://www.codepile.net/pile/mG9Pa14L) Here you can see how I implemented the detection. Don't mind the comments.
still better than perl...
Any code to share to help ?
That's wild that such a bug slippes through. Thanks for your response! I will look into using WSL
&gt; this is clearly not an issue on Windows. I really don't want to come off as rude or anything, but I am quickly getting the impression you have not dug very deeply into either operating system. On Windows, I absolutely have had to configure and manually setup graphics drivers for any non-embedded graphics card. On computers where I have either installed or updated Windows to a new version, I have had to install drivers for the embedded and non-embedded graphics cards.
Can't spell Powershell without Hell
I thought from the last question you would have got the idea of just getting on with your code and not worrying about all this?
Standardization can be difficult across multiple systems. Anaconda provides consistency. I can give you a few Terminal commands that will get you up and running on any version of macOS or Linux, whereas if you used the builtin system Python you'd run into more compatibility issues. This becomes especially important when you work on multiple projects with different, incompatible package requirements. Now, Anaconda is certainly not the only way to make a virtual environment, but it is (IMHO) one of the easiest and most robust ways. It also becomes harder to keep track of different system versions. I still need 3.6 on my Mac because tensorflow doesn't work in 3.7 (or at least it didn't last I checked; quite possible does now). I'd rather just say `source activate tensorflow` than explicitly run my scripts with `python3.6`. It makes my shebang lines more portable as well.

Ever had some braindead droolie write a Perl regex for a .NET production environment that went unnoticed until the database started getting hosed? Much like people, small problems and hit ya just as hard as big ones.
It may even be a notebook.
Yup. Shit like that has me screaming internally every time it crops up. Would it kill people to cluster around a single damned standard for their incomprehensible gibberish pattern-matching strings?
How does your teacher get 102? 28 to the -1 power is merely 1/28. The result of a modulo operation involving two numbers has to be smaller than or equal to the first number.
That's what I don't understand at all. Here's her exact work: https://imgur.com/OdwHyTe , not coded or anything. When I put in "(28^-1) mod 571" into WolframAlpha it also gives me 102. Then I put "(1/28) mod 571" into WolframAlpha and it gives me 1/28, which leads me to believe that it's the -1 power that goes crazy with mod

I don't think it's python, I think it's math. I just did a quick google and i believe that (1/28)mod517 is NOT the same as (28^(-1))mod571. Links I found are [here](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ModularInverse.html) and [khan academy on Cryptography](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/cryptography/modarithmetic/a/modular-inverses). I have a feeling that the second one is what you're looking for, and I found a support function on [geeks4geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/multiplicative-inverse-under-modulo-m/) that outputs 102 for inputs of 28 and 571.
That geeks4geeks post helped me a lot. I think I have what it needs to solve it now. Thanks a lot for your help!
\&gt; Powershell is just as capable as bash. Powershell is just as capable, but no one really knows how to use it outside of Windows sysadmin lifers, it's super verbose, and it has all kinds of weird permissions to set up. Also, it's technically a programming language on top of a shell, and Python is better for most things as a general purpose scripting language, while Unix shells tend to be better for basic file navigation. \&gt; Ok, well, stop right there. It is *sometimes* easier to install software using a package manager. It is not universally true that it's easier than installing an exe or an msi. Sometimes, installing software in Linux is ludicrously difficult. Case in point is Sublime. I stopped using Sublime completely on Linux because updating it was an unbelievable hassle. You google "how to install sublime text Linux", click on a link that has a bunch of pre-written bash scripts, and you copy and paste them into your terminal. It's really quite easy \&gt; It's not easier. You can use the exact same tools to deploy to production servers. No you can't. The build tool chains in Windows are pretty shitty compared to what they are in Linux. There are many development packages that are Linux only. As we are on a Python subreddit, I'll point out that Windows concurrency sucks balls for Python. Docker runs natively on Linux, in Windows it requires virtualization. If you're developing C and C++ applications for a Linux server, you pretty much have to develop in a Linux VM on Windows. \&gt; Apart from the cost, the differences between Windows, OSX and Linux are cosmetic. With the exception of bash, which is a fucking garbage language invented by garbage people, you use all the same CLI tools in exactly the same way on all these systems. You sound like a pretty big coding noob. At a very basic level, yes they are all pretty similar. Working on more advanced systems, they are pretty damn different. The way the Windows kernel works is fundamentally different then the way it works in Linux or Mac. The system calls are totally different; in Windows you have win32api, in Linux/Mac you have posix. Concurrency and virtualization are very different, which is one of the main reasons why it takes years for bleeding edge technology to make it to Windows from Linux. For example; if you wanted to learn machine learning a couple years ago, Windows simply wouldn't work. If you wanted to use Docker containers, Windows wouldn't work. In cloud computing, Linux is pretty much the only game in town. Azure at least allows you to make Windows server compute engines, but Microsoft saw the writing on the wall and made a Linux run time for .NET Core, fearing that they would be totally shut out of cloud computing. Basically, if you want to be a developer and you use Windows, you have to either wait 5+ years for Microsoft to port over all the cool new stuff to .NET or you use a Linux VM. And seriously, BASH is a garbage language? It's just an easier way to manipulate files. I don't know how I survived using Windows without grep and find; you basically have to use IDE based projects to track your files. In Linux, you can just use VIM and your shell.
Of all of the computers I have ever bought in my life, besides the ones I built myself, there was never a cheaper "no Windows" option. I recently bought a Thinkpad with a Windows 10 Pro license for $130. The license from Microsoft is $199. Maybe it's changing with Dell going forward, but I have not seen it myself. With most computer manufacturers, Microsoft actually gets a cut of each unit sold whether Windows is installed or not.
I think your print statement is getting thrown right in the middle of it printing everything from the line `print(product['title'])` Delete that line, and my hunch is that you will be good. Let me know if it doesn't work and I will pull out my editor to code for a few :)

Read the sidebar.
i have been using [sololearn](https://www.sololearn.com) and his book "learn python 3 the hard way" i must say that i prefer sololearn. i think anyone looking to explore and get started in coding needs to know about this resource.
I never had any problem on both Win 7 and Win 10
I started with code academy which was ‘ok’. But the best experience was through Automate the boring stuff with python.
I like sololearn because they have a mobile app. I'm a 30 year old guy wife two kids full time job so the app makes it easy to steal 15 20 mins here and there and try it on the website before I hit the hay for 30 to 60 mins. I will take a look at automate though
I use regex a lot in my job as a network engineer they’re pretty powerful everything from ping sweeping subnets to verifying old and new cdp neighbors.
That's a good place to begin, it covers the fundamentals on a brief manner, from there you would want to follow the official Python guide. Then you can move to books.
All of these basic courses are about learning syntax which is fine but what I liked about AtBS is that it gives you exercises that you can turn into real life projects, you know, transferable knowledge.
I had prior experience with C++ and PHP, and found SoloLearn pretty helpful when picking up Python. I like the knowledge checks after each concept, and the quiz at the end of each unit. They’re not cheesy, but not too hard either.
Sorry. I won't. It doesn't have Microsoft Word, Excel, or Powerpoint.
Seriously. Cmd is better.
Doesn't work with adblockers, FYI.
We'll see if I can finally finish off the release of my FEA open source package...
Did you install Anaconda? Otherwise, it's possible you have all the necessary libraries and compilers installed.
Yeah I'm just a dude who likes to tinker I want to build a robot. There are too many free robotics classes available not to do something cool like that.
That's what I like about it. To be frank I did terrible in school so them breaking stuff down and being able to see input over the years from other students is extremely helpful.
I’ve written code with tests only to break older untested code. It’s personally think it’s annoying to write test, but it does give a peace of mind during deployments.
I think it’s because 2.7 is going out of support soon, or already has. See if they have an archive or something where you can find it.
Just FYI, there are nice tools now (I use Anaconda) that make all of this optional, not required. So people can gui if they want to gui, but scripting is very much a thing.
This should go in r/learnMachineLearning but know that the ML field is basically flooded too which IMO is leading to very VERY high barriers to entry (e.g masters from good schools to get positions)
Hi! Fellow Python data scientist engineer here. Code on Windows with anaconda. I script/develop on Windows, because, even though I work in academia, my institution has a lot of connections with industry and they use Windows 98% of the time. Thus, if I want something I can easily give to a noob user client, I need to make sure that I've ironed out the installation bugs on my side. Practically, coding on Windows is more of a pain than on Linux/mac because things don't always "just work". Developers don't test on Windows platforms as consistently, configuring compilers is a pain, pip/conda don't always install things right, etc. Anyway, feel free to ask any practically oriented questions about coding on Windows (configuring compilers for f2py/cython, working with Spyder and multiple environments, git practices, etc.) I'm not an expert but I'll happily share what I do.
It’s good for a refresher and when you’re just starting. 3-5 stars.
Yes and sometimes they will stop at signals and traffic
Check out ‘learn raspberry pi programming with python’ by Wolfram Donat sounds right up your alley
thanks for the input, I have been working backwards like looking at job listings on linkedin and in my findings, I did notice ML seems to have a lot more people applying in comparison to development.
Thanks, upvoted, saved and subscribed... I have a lot of things I'm studying for first, but I would definitely like to get around to programming after my goals. I hear Python is a good starter language, but I'm also hoping it doesn't confuse me too much if I go into an older language or something... but I guess people always have to Google syntax anyway, especially once they understand the gist of programming principles
Because you have full control of your operating system, as an analogy imagine windows being excel and Linux being python for data science.
Dude do you have nothing better to do than to have garbage opinions about other peoples' likes?
&gt; bloatware free Erm. Maybe the linux kernel. But you are often installing a distro, which includes much more than just than kernel. I think this is an important distinction to note, because I don't know anyone that's compiling just the kernel for their prod systems.
&gt; bash is a garbage language Fucking lol
I'll cover all seventeen of these videos over the next three days. Thank you op.
I'm about to ask a very ignorant question, so forgive me, but what exactly is docker? As far as I understand it's essentially a virtual environment that's portable? That may be completely wrong, but I tried to install it when I was installing a lot of packages for tensorflow GPU, and it never ended up working on Windows for me.
tensorflow &gt;=1.13.1 supports py37.
Docker is a software that supports running stuff in predefined environments known as docker images. These are often based on a minimal linux varient known as alpine, though that isn't a strict requirement. I typically use them for continuous integration. It's a very easy way of using any arbitrary server to build your code without needing to run lengthy scripts to ensure required libraries are present.

Give Miniconda a whirl. [https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/](https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/) It's very small in size and gives you Conda, which you can use to create isolated environments, and also use pip in these environments.
Xonsh is reason enough. If you're primarily a Python dev or work with it a lot, it can change your life. Coming from bash, it's seamless. Basically it's a bash-compatible shell mashup with Python interpreter, with it's own powerful scripting language. I want to plot some data but don't want to write a standalone script... I can do it right in the terminal. Much more is possible too, most of it little stuff that I use every day (like list comprehension doing boring batch file stuff, etc.) Seriously. All those complaints about bash and powershell and CMD... Phth... Xonsh. https://xon.sh/
I just finished it. The course is pretty short. Finished in a little over an hour. There is some conflicting stuff (parens and capital letters). Otherwise not bad. Not a big fan of the interface - I think I spent more time trying to get the editor to let me continue as well as finding check boxes I missed than I did running the actual programs. It would be nice to see some more detailed projects. What’s presented it really simple. I need to do some more research on it to see but from my quick overview the info is really only suited to the adafruit circle board (playground?). I was really hoping to take the knowledge and build something not on the adafruit board (tach for my motorcycle) but I don’t think it translates to anything else. If you are already pro and interested in hardware programming, go for it. I don’t think signing up for pro just for this is really worth it. Thirty bucks for about an hours of lessons. Maybe in the future they’ll have more detailed projects. Anyone that joins and wants a cheap adafruit board I accidentally bought two of them. ;)
Will do thanks for the tip. I just did a few years in prison and I came home with and unquenchable thirst for knowledge. I can't stop but I guess there are way worse things to be addicted to then learning lol
Yes, you can implement this functionality with Chirps, following a simple 3-step process: You need to go to [this line](https://github.com/schedutron/chirps/blob/aa725cdf254f882b84f88eef2d8c416a113a295f/chirps/managers.py#L77) in `managers.py` file of Chirps and remove the `if` condition (as my framework currently eliminates mentions because for celebrity accounts, there are hundreds of mentions every time and I wanted to eliminate them and only respond when the actual celebrity tweeted something. Your case is different as you *do* want mentions, so removing this `if` statement will work). Now see [this function](https://github.com/schedutron/chirps/blob/aa725cdf254f882b84f88eef2d8c416a113a295f/chirps/functions.py#L193) (some of it's commented out, but is tested and works as expected when uncommented - searching for a news headline based on tweet author and then replying with results) in `functions.py` file for an example of responding based on input, and replace it (or create a new function) with whatever functionality you want. Finally, pass that function [here](https://github.com/schedutron/chirps/blob/aa725cdf254f882b84f88eef2d8c416a113a295f/chirps/main.py#L68) in `main.py` (if you created a new function) so that the handler knows which function to use when you get a mention.
Yes. Change OS.
You can't have them synchronized programatically if you have got only starting and ending gps coordinates.
Why not try a couple of sources. You'll learn faster in the end. It also depends on whether you're doing data science, web apps, etc. I like books as you can skip things you know making learning python faster. I like videos when teachers show you how to do things like coding for entrepreneurs.
Can you elaborate please?
No, I use Vanilla Python. Now that you mention it, once or twice it told me that I was missing another library. I installed that library (2 seconds) and tried again. It never took me more than 10 seconds, on both Win 7 and Win 10.
I personally didn't like it that much. It does teach, but the quizzes at the end of a chapter are kinda cheap. Some may like it, but i didn't.
The ability to install every single software package you'll ever need through one package manager is not to be underestimated. Whether it be Debian's apt or Arch's pacman - being able to manage, install and remove any installed software tools or applications through one package manager provides an amazing level of user control. One central system for managing all your software beats googling every single piece of software you're after, verifying the legitimate source and then figuring out how to go about installing it - imo
Yeah, so is sampling an option. I’ll recover 30 frames for each gps location. Is there a better ideas?
[RTFM](https://github.com/lseffer/stock_screener) \- Read the fucking manual ## Usage: * Create Google Service Account Credentials JSON * Instructions: [http://gspread.readthedocs.io/en/latest/oauth2.html](http://gspread.readthedocs.io/en/latest/oauth2.html) * Create a spreadsheet file in your Google Drive and share it with client\_email found in above mentioned JSON file. Then run * pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt * python stock\_screener.py --sac\_file path/to/sac\_file.json --gspreadsheet name\_or\_id\_of\_your\_spreadsheet
I'll ask you the same thing I ask everyone who responds with this same cliched comment: why should I? I have reasons to code in Windows but perhaps you know of non-Windows-OS advantages I should be aware of.
I don't understand you. What do you mean by sampling? If you have its gps for every frame then you should create path by finding an average gps from all of your vehicles paths and then place tiling shot frames on that "path".
A-levels are technically highschool. We do them over grade 11 and 12 however, we could also choose to start University after grade 10. There are boards that conduct exams, Cambridge is one of them. So Cambridge A-levels are different to Edexcel A-levels.
1. Speed. The same new laptop dual booting windows 10 and linux with an ssd disk. A test heavy on opening files takes twice as long in windows, even with WSL. Python tends to be heavy on opening lots of small files, and this is much slower on windows since the os hooks into all kinds of checkers for malicious content when opening a file. Even with indexing off. There is no way to turn the checks off, disabling virus check only saves a bit. 2. For people who prefer a CLI windows with powershell doesn’t come close to. bash. Again, the response is slower and feels heavy, the options to handle utf8 or color are more clunky. And tmux or screen equivalents are much less polished. 3. A dependence on closed-source, limited tool chains. The goto compiler is msvc, which is barely c99 compliant. You mention f2py, which cannot compile with msvc.
I mean for every gps coordinate there must be minimum of 30 frames. My camera captures at 30 FPS and my gps reading is 1 he. So I planning to retrieve only 30 frames for each gps coordinate. A car may be stationary at signal so there may be 1000 frames related to that gps coordinate. I’ll retrieve 30 frames out of those 1000 frames. Regarding your idea, every 30 frames of my video is related to one gps coordinate
As others have mentioned, you don't want to use 2.7. Support for it ends in 8 months. If someone is telling you to use it, check the date that they said that. It was probably in 2013. Please use the latest 3.x release. But that won't help you with the problem you have anyway. I hope this does: The "Gzipped source tarball" is just source code, and you will need to compile it first to use it. What OS are you using? If you are using Windows, you want to use the "Windows x86-64 MSI installer". On MacOS you want the "macOS 64-bit installer". If you are using a Linux distro, rather use the package manage to install it. (Eg on Ubuntu apt install python.)
Your python installation is broken. Start again. Document your steps and if it fails again say what you did as part of your request for help.
Wow... I thought the msi was something specific for msi hardware users lol. Thanks. Also I need it for tautuli, it's an addon thing for plex media server. Says it only supports 2.7
Sure. Asyncio uvloop, for example. If we are talking about Python. Take a look https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-platforms.html A full-fledged shell and toolbox are not about Windows. And perhaps you are going to deploy your software somewhere. Deb, Rpm, Kubernetes and so on are very Unix-specific.
Hm, interesting points. This is making me think a lot more about code utilization vs, development, which is not something I do in my job often. Nice food for thought. A few responses: speed is a good point, but sadly not one that's a priority with our code (beyond profiling). I've been moderately satisfied with Anaconda's cli though you're right in that it's laggy and lacks features. Not a game-changer for me, but a good note. Lastly, I compile f2py with mingw-64, which probably doesn't produce optimized code (back to the speed issue).

And what about packages that don't require asynchronous stuff? Then it's fine, yeah? Not trying to be snarky, genuinely curious. I'm trying to figure out what is overkill for our use cases. For deployment, we develop software packages for engineering analyses. So whatever we make needs to be installable/runnable for our windows-using clients.
They want some people add a chapter about Git and about Python or help proofread.

Good point. I don’t have Perl in my CV, but my six year old can be pretty devastating.
If you calculated those 30 frames per coordinate from your data then you should be ok with retrieving, for example, each 33th (1000 / 30) frame for gps.
ForceBru hit the nail on the head. This would work try: userInput = int(input("Input a number.")) except: print('Please enter a number')
It can't be uglier than JavaScript + jQuery. $()
A very good example of what can be simply when you know which tools to use. Concise but very well explained too.
Scapy, saves so much time prototyping exploits. Also fairly extensible.
&gt; all but the second to last bullet point is false (because we are assuming CPython) You ignored my statement that I was discussing "pure Python". *You* might be willing to write implementation-dependent, non-portable code, but not everyone does, and I deny your statement that "we are assuming CPython". You're also wrong to assume that nobody uses other implementations. PyPy in particular is under active development and has a significant user-base. `ctypes` is explicitly documented as a "foreign function interface" for hooking into C libraries. It is not properly speaking part of the Python language, any more than a [Python-to-R interface](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/) would be. The `ctypes.pointer` function doesn't return a native pointer, it returns a Python object. It doesn't work the same as native pointers: py&gt; import ctypes py&gt; x = 42 py&gt; ptr = ctypes.pointer(ctypes.c_int(x)) py&gt; ptr.contents c_long(42) py&gt; ptr.contents = ctypes.c_int(1042) py&gt; ptr.contents c_long(1042) py&gt; x 42 So as you can see, its not a native pointer to Python values. Its an emulation of a pointer. **And it doesn't work on Python objects**, only on dedicated ctypes objects: py&gt; ctypes.pointer(42) Traceback (most recent call last): File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt; TypeError: _type_ must have storage info The bottom line is that `ctypes` gives you a object *called* "pointer", which can be used to emulate pointers for the purposes of interfacing with C libraries, but it doesn't add a native pointer type to the language. I stand by all my statements about Python not having pointers as such, *even* if you ignore other implementations and only consider CPython.
I agree with all you've said. In fairness though, Bash is powerful but it is rather hard to get your head around.
Yes it can, https://ibb.co/ZXRvT1X
I saw your project on discord. It is awesome dude. It isn't similar, it is superior than mine project in any way. I just made a demo but you are making a real programming language. Thanks for calling it up again.
True

`collections`. Python already has a great set of basic datatypes, but `collections` is a super-great bag of even more useful stuff. Personal favorites include `ChainMap` and `DefaultDict`. Its abstract base classes are also good to use with `isinstance` on the occasions when I need to test “is it a...” because they tend to sensibly handle cases I hadn’t even considered.
HI, I am happy to help proofread
It's free and you don't have to deal with Microsoft's bullshit
&gt; For simplicity, we’re going to stick to ASCII characters in this article. That's problematic in Python 3 as it's ask Unicode by default. Also, no mention of `is` vs `==`?
That's fantastic man. Is this open source?
Yes, that’s what I do, although I specialize in 2D, and use after effects most. I don’t really know people who use blender for 3D motion design, most of them use cinema4d that has specialized tools for it and integrate well with after effect. For AE, Andrew Kramer is a great ressource on youtube. Good luck!
Doesn’t seem like fun :D I work freelance so I never have any meeting, I grew to like to luxury. What kind of work do you do? Are your python scripts use for web backend, or is it an app that runs in the browser...?
Requests. Easy to use. Clear documentation. Makes everything easier for me day to day. I get sad when I have to use urllib now lol
If Windows users are your end users, you have no another choice except Windows. But my experience says that Windows is totally unusable for Python developer. Is this environment ok for you? Have nothing against it.
This sounds like something I would like, thank you for the very detailed answer. As a data engineer, do you only do the data processing or do you do analysis as well? If so, is it all based on the data? I met a business analyst lately and we talked a bit about ML, and in the end he said it wouldn’t be of used to him because half of his analysis is basically things that he “guesses” based on his knowledge of the market or marketing in general. It didn’t sound precise enough to be appealing to me.
I have used and developed for UNIX, Linux, MacOS and Windows since 1978. Since the early 2000s, when I started using python, my preferred development platform is Linux because it's just easier to get things done and installed. The cross-platform capabilities of python make developing on Linux and deploying elsewhere almost painless. YMMV, of course.
 I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you're referring to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I've recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX. Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called "Linux", and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project. There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine's resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU/Linux. All the so-called "Linux" distributions are really distributions of GNU/Linux.
I use namedtuple a lot, when I feel too lazy to write a class definition. Also, nametuples are immutables, which is cool.
I did sololearn with Java. It was nice, but didn't help to learn much, beyond the very basics. Hackerrank on the other hand is much better, since you're being called to solve problems programmatically. Also codewars is nice for the same reason, but hackerrank is more structured, imho. That's where I've practiced my C++ skills, while I was learning the language.
Wow, thank you so much for such a detailed answer. Would you care explaining what stand ups entail? I’m not entirely sure. Would you say you write programs, or scripts? Another answer seemed to say there was a significant difference between the two. The more I think about it, the more it’s obvious to me I really write scripts. Which I don’t test, so I guess I should learn that. You said you worked solo, do you mean you were your own team in a company or that you were working freelance? Or does freelancing not exist in the realm of python? Thanks!
Kind of in the same boat as you but from a different profession, I see how scary it is. So from what i understand, is your job translating data from one standard to another? It sounds like you’re still in marketing but in a different role, am I correct? How much do you think what you learnt in your previous job helps you today?
Nah. Sorry 😐
Urg, I learnt python with python 3 and every time I find a module in python it instinctively pisses me off, I’m sure I’m not the only one, haha. You say you like working at night and I get that. Do you do so on your own projects or does your company lets you manage your work hours as you choose?
Bad bot.
Damn, processing a lot of data and automating stuff, this sounds exactly like the things I love to do with python. Do you have a math background? I unfortunately don’t and it seems like in a lot of data processing jobs it really helps. Also, I gather you work full time in a company, do you think this kind of job can be done freelance as well? Thanks!
Does your job forbid you to use a IDE? :(
Have a look at attrs. Or, I guess, python 3.7. For me, namedtuples only make sense when I need the performance, which I never do.
good, but since when? I swear last week I could not install it
There are different kinds of tests. Mainly integration and non regression. In TDD though, tests also assume the value of a design tool, and usually they're unit tests. They help you write cleaner design, assuring you only develop feature requested and you do them all. They also provide some kind of non regression, but they're white box tests. Also some kind of black box tests, maybe by someone that's not the developer, is good practice imho. In any case... Test your code and share it somehow. The user too wants some kind of assurance that your code is working, that can be provided with tests
I have a friend who does supply chain and who’s thinking about changing careers because she discovered how much she liked to replace excel with code :D Is your work all data processing or do you analyze the data as well? Is your analysis only based on data or also on more “subjective” insights? I have a friend who’s a business analyst and his analysis are half data, half... guesses/market knowledge.
I don’t get the reference to the red uniforms, haha :D It’s interesting what you say about scripts though, as I feel it applies to me: I don’t have a CS background, I’m just generally good with computers and I like to write scripts that make my life easier. What would you say a scripter lacks compared to a programmer? Also, py2 is hell.
Awesome, but just one thing, it's scrape, not scrap, and scraped, not scrapped.
I’m interested in big data, currently training myself on some ML exercises. Do you have a math background? I was good in math and I understand matrices and vectors, however I haven’t done proper math in 10 years and I don’t know much about statistics. Do you feel this is something required for your kind of jobs?
Pandas. My job seems to be a never ending stream of reports that need to be automated. Thankfully I never have to touch Excel and can output .to_html()
Oof. Am I correct in assuming that of all the free options for 2D, Blender with a few tweaks is probably the closest I'll get? I really hate how Adobe's gone purely subscription model for their software (or at least the parts that drastically speed up your workflow). I once considered pirating it, but the effort needed for a robust antivirus is basically the same as an Adobe CC subscription...
Pipenv. Makes venvs so much easier!
Would you recommend pipenv over something like conda? We are using conda at my workplace, but we are considering moving to pipenv.

sqlalchemy, if you've ever had to deal with raw SQL or even peoples failed attempts at writing their own wrappers around SQL, it makes databases a pure joy in comparison.
Awesome! Thanks for this! I'm just starting to learn Python so this is super helpful. One last thing: To have this run automatically and, ideally, constantly, would I put this on a server? I wouldn't want it to run from my computer because that'd be unstable due to a number of factors but I've seen some websites that, I believe, have this sort of functionality.
Use copy (https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-copy.html) to extract to a local tmp file or stdout. Select * will be significantly slower for large tables.
Numpy. import numpy as np is the first line of basically every single thing i've written in python.
I mean. If you install Ubuntu with all the default packages then yes. But even minimal graphic install buntu is lightweight compared to a default Win10 install where candyfuckingcrush is delivered by default.
Yes, but there is still a distinction between "the linux kernel" and "a linux distribution". Distros can contain bloatware.
Python api is a part of FreeIPA itself. It is available in any properly enrolled client. It is also available through PyPI. If you'd run 'ipa console', you would get it inside an interactive python shell.
Turtle, because I can draw without any external programs.
I'm gonna add small extras stuff I haven't read in the other comments to avoid redundancy : - Windows Path uses backslash like C:\User. But the backslash is a special character and when you try to work with file paths you have to "escape" ( means cancel the special effect of a special character) by adding an extra backslash. It ends up looking like C:\\Users\\Brandon etc and it's fucking annoying. - Some tools built with Python like Ansible do not work on Windows because Windows doesn't support some libs. Meaning they if you end up doing system administration stuff with Ansible you cannot run your ansible playbooks on Windows. - Windows doesn't teach you take care of your system really well and pay attention to what's running in the background etc.
Totally agree with you. I'm not making the distinction for the sake of simplicity because OP confirmed they he is quite ignorant on the subject and I don't want to loose him with some technical terminology. But then again I totally agree with you xd
random because i could go without any other
(A few days later) Manager: Good news that we'll keep everything Python in Python. You'll be transferred to the C++ team next week, they're needing good devs like you.
I wonder if there is such a list for Python+PyPy programs....
Do you think that's cool? Yeah, me too! Nobody's clapping?
Props to whoever does this. 20-30 pages each for [python, git] with examples is a lot of writing.
To paraphrase beyonce - if you liked it you shoulda put a test on it But seriously, if you want to rely on a piece of code, having an automated test is a great way to be able to lazily know you haven't broken it doing something else.
nah, while there are dialects which are mostly a result of the power creep/evolution of the expressive power of regexes over time (eg BRE -&gt; ERE -&gt; PCRE -&gt; ... that can be easily observed in linux tools), it's pretty easy to tell what 98% of regexes in the wild do because the vast majority of people don't bother with stuff beyond capturing groups. figure out the concept of: anchors ^ $ character classes, both predefined and custom quantifiers *+? {n,m}, greedy and nongreedy behavior (eg * vs *?) capturing groups () alternative | and you are good to go. That's the fundamental core of pretty much any regex flavor you can stumble upon. Arguably everything beyond that is fluff that is merely nice to know and stack overflow can take care of that. I certainly don't get tripped up by the differences between BRE, ERE, PCRE, whatever the python dialect is called and what have you, yet for example I never bothered to learn which combination of symbols stands for negative lookbehinds.
I can tell what all your jobs are based on your answers.
`itertools`. Half of that stuff should be builtins .
Path.py It's a wrapper for pathlib, but it just makes working with files so much easier. I always use it for file work. from path import Path d = Path('/home/guido/bin') for f in d.files('*.py'): f.chmod(0o755) # Globbing for f in d.files('*.py'): f.chmod(0o755) # Changing the working directory: with Path("somewhere"): # cwd in now `somewhere` ... # Concatenate paths with / foo_txt = Path("bar") / "foo.txt"
&gt; .to_html() oh wow. never knew pandas had this.
Syntax is pretty much PCRE everywhere you look with minor differences in sugar, backslashes and ‘extensions’ (like named groups in python). I think the big trick is to recognize when your expression has gotten too complicated and needs to be refactored into a different solution approach. The ‘regular expressions can’t parse HTML’ SO thread comes to mind: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1732348/regex-match-open-tags-except-xhtml-self-contained-tags/1732454#1732454 It’s also just inherently more difficult to read an expression than it is to write and verify it I think.
My favorite is my own fea package. I’m biased, but it’s fun to develop. My most used module is numpy. It’s not even a dependency as far as I’m concerned. It’s in almost everything I use. I’m an aerospace engineer, so not a big surprise.
On Windows, they build it for you. You shouldn’t have to build any package unless you are a developer or want a dev version.
`lmdb`. It's got everything I want from a embedded database, and nothing that I don't.
I agree with your path complaint, but you can just quote the path. It’ll also fix the inevitable space in the file path issue that also affects Linux.
I've started writing this article at close to midnight and finished at 2am 🕑. And even though the English is a second language to me, I must have been real tired to overlook such a basic mistake. Thanks buddy, got a fix this.
no shebang?
would you go through and say who you think is what?
 youtube-dl is so feature-rich and intuitive.. maybe it was omitted from the list to give a spotlight on a lesser known library but that's not going to change the fact of how awesome it is
error
Running a script by hand to test is on a very small script is fine. You can validate the relevant output and you’re fine. Now write a 320k lined library and make sure it doesn’t have any regressions when you add a feature. I run 40k test examples that take ~5 hours that I have to then sift through. Compare that with 880 unit tests that run in 9 minutes on every build that I get an email when I break something or there has been a package update that breaks something. With few tests, it used to take me a few days to push a release after a feature freeze. Then it got up to a month, then two months. Then I added tests and the time went back down to a month and I got rid of the small task feature freeze. It’s also more than doubled in size and that hasn’t increased the release testing period. As your programs grow in size and complexity and stability requirements, you start to need tests.
3?
sklearn or ElementTree
I like throwing animal names in for my integer and float values in my testing. You claim it validates the type... I also test to prove the API works like I want to, which almost always means I have to manipulate types. Why do I need to pass in a list of values to the lookup function?
Can't you just do a web application and process data on a server?
Can you just loop over all of them in an easy way like you can integers?
Why do you need it done it python?
yep

I miss read this as MONTY Python F
No worries, I have challenges in my second language too (German)
Thanks for sharing this. I've actually been considering building something along these lines for a while now, glad to see I haven't been alone in seeing the need - I look forward to playing around with it a bit this weekend.

I was using it for past 2 months. Decided to put it on Github yesterday only. Glad you appreciate it.
Yeah, it’s just a matter of fate that I’m programmer in marketing - was moved on this project by CTO after half of the year as intern/junior developer by occasion. So I can’t say I’m still in marketing. From marketing I got the whole vision of the marketing automation, what’s behind our code. And this doesn’t really help to write the code better. I’d say it helps a little with the new features discussions with product managers and keep me motivated, while a lot of my colleague-programmers not always understand how they are “making the world better”. In my opinion software engineering demands way more new skills and technologies than my former experience. It’s like the new profession “from scratch”. Hope it helps to prepare you for the shift ;)
Actually for the specific game you don't really to do template matching since with respect to the screen the horizontal position of the dino doesn't change. It's the trees and birds that move to the left. So for the left part of the screen where the dino is located, you could do something more lightweight like blob detection.
To be honest I have no idea how people just pick one thing to do with these languages. There is so much that you can do that it's mind blowing. I wish they had shit like this when I was a kid
Yeah I have only taken one quiz so far and it was pretty lame. I don't wanna get over confident though I'm sure it will have me ready to rip out my hair soon

hey erok, this is great feedback! we left this course mainly pretty short because this is the first hardware course and we didn't know how many people would take it. it's very possible that we add more content to it in the future. also, can you give one or two examples of the parens and capital letters conflicts? i'd love to fix those up asap.
I don't have much of a math background. In college I majored in geography, and the farthest I got in math was a business calculus class. When I need to do complicated math, I consult with the people I know who have advances skills there. So I was hired to do GIS and the timing worked out perfectly for me to transition into web dev and then we hired a guy who took that over and I slid over into python automation. I also do some c# server side stuff and automations when we need to leverage the full power of GIS. I work full time at a electric utility in the GIS department. So, I don't have to deal with the typical bullshit IT departments usually have to deal with. This gives us so much freedom to just go to work and build things the way we want and however we want. We don't have project managers, business analysts, DBAs, system admins... It's just me and another developer.
Not me anyway. I usually have a bash script wrapping my python script
Most of my Python projects at work involve making http requests but I have never actually touched urllib. Requests is just so nice to work with
That's definitely true. It takes some time, but once you're used to it it's hard to go back to Windows
I wish people would use a different website than medium to write these sort of articles. medium started out pretty nice, but the layout (bottom bar, need to scroll to get to content) and the annoying pop-ups "***Let's make things official***" - No! Go away! - it always irritates me when an article I would like to read is on medium.
Yes, that's basically what it is. In Linux, it creates a virtual tiny OS that uses your systems kernel. In Windows, it needs to also spin up a virtual kernel so it's more of a full VM. Tensorflow and Windows don't really work well together, but with Docker you can create a tiny virtual Linux environment. There are many other potential pit falls to run into, so yeah it can be hard to get something like that running.
Stop using old syntax?
Oh my god don't get me started on the obnoxious amount of space website eats up on smaller resolutions! I usually just delete the elements manually
Agree. Should be a built-in module.
Well part of the model though is that bloggers can get a little income out of the writing they do.
I like this thread.
Thanks for the tutorial. Did you consider using iterrows() to iterate over the dataframe instead of the for loop? Asking because a similar situation came up for me at work last week, and I ended up implementing my code with iterrows.
its #37
Thanks my man I really appreciate it I literally started coding last week so I’m pretty much IQ&lt;75 at the moment when it comes to this sfuff.
I mean, that doesn't actually make sense, right? Pip wouldn't tell you that you were missing a library. If it were a package hosted on PyPi, it would automatically download it. If were a missing system dependency, it'll error with whatever filename it's looking for. Most people get [this error](https://stackoverflow.com/q/2817869/817630) when trying to install pandas and numpy. As you can see, the answers there are not super straightforward, and the one the most votes is actually wrong. It's more complicated than just installing another library. It's complicated enough that a bunch of answers on StackOverflow recommend downloading wheels from Christoph Gohlke's website and installing them from the filesystem, which is obviously a broken model. E.g., https://stackoverflow.com/a/28911071/817630 https://stackoverflow.com/a/19098271/817630 https://stackoverflow.com/a/48708030/817630 https://stackoverflow.com/a/19098271/817630
I don’t have a strong math background and I don’t think it is required for this kind of job. I would say a mathematical way of thinking can help you give perspective on certain tasks or problems like it can do with any other problem-solving activity. Maybe with Big Data focused on Data Science, on a really advanced level, some knowledge and understanding of statistics can help but so far I haven’t found anything nor anyone that REALLY needed that for this kind of job. And if a specific task needs it, it would probably give you the chance of learning it along the way on a hands-on scenario more than it would need you to study it theoretically.
There was a significant movement to do that, but in the end, they realized that requests needed to be updated more often than the standard library.
Ive gotten to use sqlalchemy for the first time using queries I inherited from someone else, and it takes about 30 minutes to run, is that normal or should I look into optimizing the query?
Yup. Looks like an [error](https://i.imgur.com/35V3uHx_d.jpg?maxwidth=640&amp;shape=thumb&amp;fidelity=medium) to me.
The for loop seems like a simpler approach to grasp, but iterating over the available rows should perhaps be added into article. What approach do you typically use with Pandas module?
The amount of things that pandas can do in a single line of code never fails to amaze me
What's wrong with line comment (# ) in the front of every line? Select those lines in your editor and pick *Comment out*, *Toggle comment* or similar command from the toolbar or by keyboard shortcut.
You can also create dfs from tables you've copied using pd.read_clipboard()
I thought there wasn't a purpose for them anymore. Everything is default utf8
Not enough info about the query to give you the good advice

What's the correct way?
In Py3, you can just write `super().f()`
And the answer would be 3?
Yes
What if there is multiple inheritance?
Ahh! Awesome!! Thanks for this feedback. Excited to make this change and add some coverage testing with Travis!
Thanks
Yep you're right, looks like this works pretty well in my editor (IDLE). Thanks!
This is resolved by a C3 method resolution order (mro). Basically, the function that gets called is based on the order of the base classes. [Source](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html)
Then you would need to look into learning a framework like Django or Flask and then for a place to host your web app.
Maybe. Extensions use JS. But if you can run WASM from it, you may also be able to use PyOdide. So you could theoretically create extensions with Python, but I'm unsure how exactly could this be done (it would require some wrapper) and how would performance look like.
I haven't found it unusable for my work. There definitely is extra work that we need to put in sometimes when weird things don't work and we have to find a workaround. But overall it's fine for what I do.
Since I've started using type hinting, I get annoyed with unlabeled variables.
Probably? Mostly our clients are interested in deploying on clusters for parallelization, not on a server, but I imagine what we're doing is not the fanciest way to get the job done.
id rather have control over my machine rather than send "telemetry" data to Microsoft. Any programmer worth their salt, unless forced to by their company, would much prefer to work in a free and open environment like Linux
[Hypothesis](https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstart.html) - automated generation of test cases makes testing so much easier and more fun. It's even improved the design of my code, because testing is so powerful when the behaviour is simple to describe with minimal edge cases that the extra effort is more than paid off by a three-line super-powered test.
There are a few exceptions that I had a lot of trouble with when I first started, which made it super frustrating to inherit badly documented code from a colleague who had no idea how to make it run on Windows. I figured that if I just stick in Windows and make sure I can install and run everything, then I save my end-users headaches without telling them that they can't run my software.
Configparser. I seem to use it on every script and I find it extremely useful when writing a script for people that look at my code and don't know where to put credentials.
Oh my God....
yes, it's clearly in the footnotes

Also the amount of fuckups you can do in a single line of pandas code.
I didn't know that, and that's of course fine, but I'm just referring to the website layout, and how it's difficult to actually read the content.
Love this list! Really opened up some ideas on work-related projects and issues I'm grappling with now.
You can do pretty much anything if you have the right tool. I find this is where most of my time is spent when I am trying to do something new. I just need to figure out what tools I am going to use to do the thing I wanna do. Lots of googling later, and a little code writing later, I've gotten it done.
Man I sometimes feel using Pandas is like using a cheat code. It literally saves me hours of work.
What!!!
Firefox Reader Mode is a blessing for this, it also can help get around paywalled articles.
Your ide will have a short cut to comment out a block. You should get the best tools and learn how to use them. However unless you're debugging, you shouldn't comment out large sections of code. Use version control instead.
No, Medium authors seem to love throwing in irrelevant images, which is why I love using Firefox Reader Mode on pages like this--it cuts the crap.
But then you have to use Firefox...
You can also use tkinter canvases.
Link to the latest version?
This was painful to read. Lol.
Here's the code I've got so far. :) Just updated it to get critiques, so feel free to give me your input. https://github.com/backlash84/Text-Based-RPG/blob/master/Code%20v4%20fixed.
psycopg2 because it allows me to only have to use "one" language in my job, although i do have to use sql it can all be done in one script
It used to be fun, but for some reason, there's this trend of lots of meetings. It's supposed to settle down in a 3 to 6 months, but currently it's meetings, meetings, meetings... Fortunately, I'm not alone. Part of a team of 3 Python devs that I'm a part of. Two seniors and 1 junior. And even the junior dev is really on his game. He'll be a senior dev in a year or two, I think. Right now, we're developing self-service tools that reliably automate the creation and decom'ing of anything on an internal corporate network. They're Python3 front to back. Back-end driven with a Python/Django web front-end, but some of the tools are command-line only. And others are just simple maintenance scripts executed by nightly cronjobs. What do you work on?
Cool!! I'll take a look in a bit.
While you're at it, try a better editor like Visual Studio Code
i like this content
I do video editing and motion design mostly, working in several commercial agencies: I edit commercials, do case studies videos, mood videos, this kind of things. To be honest it's pretty well paid for not a lot of work and I enjoy working one week a month in average. I'm also a travel photographer and travel around the world pretty often. Just came back from a 3 months roadtring around the west of the US.
Omg my python program got featured
That's great to know, thank you :) I tend to read a lot of research papers, most of which I understand a 10th of, so I was beginning to worry, but I guess this is way more about academics than real world situations.
To be honest this sounds like a pretty sweet job. Do you like what you do?
Thank you so much for your answers :) What's really interesting, in the end, is how different the answers are. I feel like python, and automation in general can be used in so many ways and industries, and that's why I'm having trouble figuring out where to go from the "I can write scripts" phase.
To be honest, I think you'll be better off learning fusion than blender, which is free as well and integrated with the rest of Da Vinci Resolve, so you'll have a great video editor and state of the art color grading suite with it, all for free. Fusion isn't really used in the motion graphics industry (AE does not have any competitor in the industry really) but you'll learn node based compositing/working, and it's great, much better than layers. It can do 2d and 3d too, so that's neat.
The only problem I've had with Firefox was one browser add-on from chrome wasn't on it, but the developer is working on it. Every major add-on has been on it.
That and the dev tools suck
Take a look at Cement.

A DnD character generator, I have only recently gotten into programming and I’ve already found a way to apply it to my life.
Any particular reason you'd want to use PyPy for random applications? I've mainly used it as a drop-in CPython replacement to speed up processing heavy scripts I write for myself/other developers so I don't have to do performance optimizations. If things are expected to be super fast from the get go, I just use libraries with C bindings, it also seems to be what everyone does anyways so PyPy as limited uses.
Fuckit.py not because I actually use it but because its existence makes me laugh. https://github.com/ajalt/fuckitpy
A lot of us are allowed to work from home Tuesdays and Thursdays. I'll typically remote in to do work in that case. Sometimes I have to go in to clarify requirements though... and my boss is extremely busy.. hard to get even 5 minutes with him haha
I use to really enjoy medium when it first launched. Not it’s just cramped feeling and you don’t even get enough articles to decide if it’s worth paying for. I don’t mind supporting things I enjoy, but give me a chance to decide before you paywall me.
Yes, it does mean the website only exists when your code is running, if you stop your code on your pc the website will no longer be accessible. In this case, your pc is acting as the server for your website. This is where hosting comes in, you can find a lot of websites that offer you a host (their server) where you can deploy your code. Those servers run 24/7 so your code is always running and your website stays on the internet! (this is my current understanding of it, but I'm learning too so feel free to correct me if I'm wrong here)
Technically they're packages, but we know what you mean.
I think the only way they get income is if they opt in to the "Member" program, which only allows those who pay 5$ a month to view all of the "member" articles. If this was a member article - with the author getting money - then we'd all not be able to read it.

I mean, if you wanna be able to use a Python interpreter, you want to use shorter code or you have no knowledge of C, then why not?
Not quite. The author gets money if it’s a member article and a paying member “claps” on it. Sort of like if you had to pay to be on facebook and you got paid based on likes to your post.
Just seems that the gains are minimal for most applications and the cost is relatively high. What do you mean by shorter code?
What do you mean by "cost"? I meant it's simpler than C++ or C.
You're going to have to define the problem a bit more. What constitutes a constraint? What are the statistics like? What are the outputs?
&gt; I meant it's simpler than C++ or C. Ah. Understood. &gt; What do you mean by "cost"? Well library compatibility is one example of added cost, you definitely won't get 100% of CPython compatible 3rd party modules working right off the bat with PyPy. But yeah, compared to using C or C++ it's much preferable. Anyhow sorry for the confusing thread and thanks for replying :)
It's okay. Besides, better to know the roles of each programming language than fanboy over it.
Ah kinda cool to see my project up there :P
A constraint is that each person has a different cost, ex. $8,000. And you cannot spend over $50,000 on the entirety of 6 people. Each person is matched up against one other person so you can only pick one person out of the 2 in the matchup.
I will look into this. Thanks!
I am a beginner and am doing this for a project for class. So my knowledge is very limited.
I have made sure that the connections were correct and had already made sure that the variables were printed to make make sure the camera had actually picked it up. Im not too sure how to share the source code as i have never posted before. I am a beginner to programming in general and am doing this for a school project. So i dont know a whole lot about this. Thank You for your reply though!
So, you need to find pairings of people whose total cost is less than some fixed amount. Sounds trivial so far. I assume there's something that you're trying to maximize in this, which makes simple, naive pairings insufficient.
This is kind of simpler and might help you \-------------------------------------------------------------------- print('this is your own virtual grocery list') groceries = \[\] i = 1 while i &lt; 5: choice = input('would you like to add or remove something from the list? ') if choice == 'add': add = input("what would you like to add? ") groceries.append(add) elif choice == 'remove': remove = input('what would you like to remove? ') groceries.remove(remove) groceries.sort() print(groceries) &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; hope it helps
Yes absolutely. I have a set of statistics (these 24 people are fighters) so for example, each significant strike constitutes .5 points, a take down is 5 points etc. So I’m tryna to maximize points and see if there is a correlation between a maximized group of 6 people and the constraints between them
I tried something similar to this, but my syntax was different. I will give this a try!
Oh, I see. You can use sqlite, it's easy to use.
Why not just run a linear regression on the set of 24 as a whole?
Which one was it?
I will look into it. Thanks!!
Videodownloader
Your welcome.
Hmm I need to get between 20-150 possible lineups for the set of fighters. Would I be able to find that through a linear regression? (Haven’t done one in so long I’d have to look up how to do one again) Ya I’d like to do that but what would be the best method using python or excel to find the correlation between the statistics? Really appreciate your help, thanks a lot
Maximising/minimising costs over groups of people sounds like it may solvable via the [Hungarian Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_algorithm) or some variation of that.
You're correct! I personally use DigitalOcean and am super happy with it, but feel free to shop around for other hosts.
Yes, to keep your bot running for an indefinite time period, you should deploy it on a cloud service. I would suggest [Heroku](https://heroku.com) (as that's what I use for my bots) and have provided brief Heroku setup instructions in the `README` of Chirps' repository.
I'm just wondering why you need to pair fighters to find these values. It seems an unnecessary complication. It sounds as if you have two separate problems. One is to analyze the fighters to see what stats contribute to their cost. The other is to generate pairings --subject to a cost constraint-- that optimize some still-unknown quantity.
I tried your code and pyautogui captured about 4 frames every second. There might be a delay setting for pyautogui, or pyautogui might be a toy.

I mainly use this in my CI builds and [here](https://github.com/erayerdin/tgcli/blob/master/.travis.yml) is an example.
I only do very basic analysis on the data for sanity checks or type checking and often rely on a real analyst if theres analysis work that needs to be done.
You can paste the code into this (site)[https://trapbot.site/paste/upload]. Or use another pastebin site, I just like to push mine when I get a chance and show off.
Do you maybe have a better alternative for making screenshots?
Thanks for the suggestion but I think that I've figured out that OpenCV is not too slow but pyautogui is too slow at taking screenshots.
Are those recommended courses on there good? Thinking of buying them
While I'm trying to understand your problem well enough to recommend some sort of optimization algorithm for it, you may want to crack open a Jupyter notebook, `import pandas as pd`, and do some exploratory data analysis (EDA) to start to get a feel for your data. There are plenty of articles on-line to guide you through the first steps of doing EDA, so just ~~Google~~ DuckDuckGo for them. I should have given you enough keywords to get started.
Could you please point out some resources (sites, books) to transition from a scripter to a programmer? Thanks.
I’ll help proofread.
Essentially it’s for a sports betting algorithm I have made in excel but I know it would be much better if I can make it in python. So essentially if you pick one fighter, you cannot pick his opponent because only one of them can win. You can make up to 150 entries of different sets of 6 fighters and you get scored against other people in a tournament based off the fighters they picked. Essentially you can’t come in 1st if you pick both fighters that are fighting each other because you get additional points for winning. You have $50,000 to pick 6 fighters and with these 6 fighters you need to get more points than everyone out (which will be based on which round the fight is ended, take downs, etc.) So I want an algorithm to maximize between 20 and 150 lineups
It counts people legally belonging to a certain family as a part of that family,&gt;! i.e Joffrey, Myrcella and Tommen belong to house Baratheon while Gendry doesn't, Jon also belongs to the Targaryen family!&lt;

This is sweet. I haven't really had too much of a pain with file paths to be honest, but I'm always for making life a bit easier.
We're getting closer. So, each fighter has a cost to place a bet on said fighter. The player is limited to $50,000 in said bets. I'm guessing that anything not spent from the $50,000 allotment is considered wasted. And, the player is also capped at six fighters to place bets on. Victory is determined by point total and points are determined not by events that happen within a fight (since these fights don't actually happen) but by statistics of the fighters involved. Does this sound correct so far?
I actually prefer writing plain SQL in comparison to using ORMs for the most part. It feels much more natural to me, and I am far more productive. That being said, I do think that in many projects using something like SQL Alchemy could probably make your database interaction more consistent (among other things).
Yes exactly, if the fighter is a heavy favourite in betting odds, he will cost a lot more than the fighters that are underdogs. Because you are competing against other people’s lineups that they constructed, you want to have some underdogs in / someone who people think won’t get many points to have a higher probability to place higher in the tournament if you are correct. You can also calculate the implied probabilities of the fights going a specific amount of rounds / probability of a fighter winning based off their given odds. So I match betting odds with other statistics such as takedowns per minute and other things. And yes, if you don’t spend the $50,000, the extra amount will just be dead money not used within your entry And yes, you MUST enter 6 fighters Lastly, no these fights actually do occur, but I am trying to make an algorithm to make predictions of the maximum efficient lineups to enter into the tournament
I also uninstalled and reinstalled cffi.
Used to be the case, they have made significant improvements on them lately.
Surely there aren't going to be 276 matches so that every possible pairing of fighters can happen, will there?
Oh that’s why we are confused here. There are 24 fighters and they are ONLY set up to fight 1 person which is predetermined. They don’t fight each person. Sorry if I confused that
Betamax https://github.com/betamaxpy/betamax I often write code that interacts with external services, usually RESTful services. It can be very hard to get test coverage on these interactions. Before Betamax I would either have to deploy a real or mock copy of the external service. Now I can years those interactions offline and writing the test fixtures is super simple because Betamax does it automatically. Updating the tests is also very quick and easy.
I'll bet a blog post by some SEO ninja is behind this
Well, I am starting to prefer the iterrows approach because I can refer to columns in the data frame by name instead of by index. So instead of df.iloc\[x, 0\], I could do row\['company\_name'\]. This is particularly nice if I need to reference multiple columns and the order or number of columns in the dataframe are liable to change.
Haha no I'm not _that_ confident.
You need to learn about WSGI, interface used for running website servers with python. Stands for “web server gateway interface” I think. And how it works with frameworks like flask, Django, and pyramid which make it easier to create python web servers.

Well, I've seen other comments, so I'm gonna try to shorten it right now. However, if I were to expand it, I would probably try to make different game modes. (That might take some time since I'm still very new to coding.)
You need to declare though variables on the very top namespace, or indentation level. You could make a function that yields them, the function will be accessible from the other script if you import it, and you can access top level variables using the dot operator. import script script.function() script.variable That's what your asking right? Or am I way off?
Flask, requests
I think thats what i need to do. Ill give it a shot. Do you have any tips as to how i could accomplish getting a function to make these variables? I will be experimenting with this idea for now. Thank You!

Take a look at Flask-SocketIO by Miguel. Basically you'll need two scripts: 1. SocketIO Flask server which takes care of distriburing the audio files or audio stream to a room of connected clients. 2. SocketIO client with messages/calls for uploading music(streams) and pausing, resuming, ... This, together with pygame for actually playing and pausing the audio, should get you quite far.
The cost of dropping to C is pretty high IMO. You have to be willing to do tons of debugging and analysis and verify you don't have any memory corruption vulnerabilities, or you're potentially adding vulnerabilities to an application written in a language that shouldn't have them (at least those types of vulns). Also you need to make sure that anyone who maintains it or will in the future knows C, and that's a heavy cost. Now your salary requirements are decently higher. It's hard enough to find a good python dev with domain knowledge in the applicable field, and now you need to find that plus someone who's experienced with C. And if they're not, you're back to worrying about them adding vulns. If your performance requirement is solved by just dropping in pypy, that's a much better idea IMO. I definitely see that C is sometimes necessary with python projects, but it's a significant cost if this is actually a business. If it's just your personal project and you already know C, then it's a relatively low cost with a huge gain. Otherwise if it's a job you'll potentially leave, then it's a high cost to that business. I wouldn't do that to my employers unless absolutely necessary and I'd make sure they recognize that, and regardless before even thinking of dropping to C or using pypy, I'd be profiling the hell out of the code and making sure I'm doing absolutely everything I can to improve the performance with pure python in the CPython env. There's always something that can be improved.
&gt; he's probably a data science type of guy Correct. &gt; shebangs are for unix users and such I do use unix, but i find shebangs rather unnecessary.

Do you have a history of fights for each fighter? You could probably draw a point estimate on each stat by looking at the history for that fighter.
I've seen the comments, and I just have to say thanks for all the advice!
**NOT FROM CONCENTRATE**
I have all the points the fighters have gotten in the past during other events. What I’m trying to do is figure out what makes a maximized lineup by looking at all the lineups that have won / solver maximized lineups and see if there are similarities in constraints between the winning lineups. But what do you mean by a “point estimate”? Like a projection?
&gt; This module is like violence: if it doesn't work, you just need more of it.
IFTTT? Or is that something else?
I had anaconda installed before I installed pycharm professional and it found it and uses it. Can also managing installing packages etc
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_estimation I think what you've got yourself is a variant of the [0/1 Knapsack problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem#0/1_knapsack_problem). Your knapsack capacity is $50,000/six fighters. You'd just need to modify it to handle having two capacity constraints instead of one and to account for options dropping off when formulating a partial solution, i.e. removing each fighter's opponent from consideration in further calculations.
Awesome thank you so much! I’ll read up an it and see if it works effectively for what I’m doing. Thanks so much for taking the time to look into this
You're very welcome. Good luck!

SOCKET! I think that was the term I was missing! Thank you very much. I'll look into the module you mentioned, too :)
Sounds like you need to make your file executable (chmod u+x filename.py in Linux, or change the Application it opens with in Windows from an editor to an executor) or explicitly run it with Python (python filename.py).
I'm a Big Data Engineer by day, *ML dabbler by night,* at the moment. I don't have any proper, formal math background, but I do have a science background (molecular bio), plus the level of general geekiness required to wind up teaching myself CS while studying that, so at some point above the average population level and below math grad level of math-savviness, skewed heavily towards data analysis skills. On the Big Data side, in my current position you primarily need to know the standard CS toolkit math topics - Boolean logic, basic set theory, algorithmic complexity, that sort of thing. We're working up the Data Hierarchy Of Needs, so it's pretty much Statistics 101 level at most right now for stuff like monitoring. If you know enough linear algebra to be comfortable with matrices and vectors, you should be more than fine. On the ML side, that's far more mathy. Most obviously, go hard on the statistics, but if you want to deeply grok the research, you might need a level of general competence to handle the proofs and such.
&gt; Ah okay so if I'm understanding correctly script's from different languages are easily compiled and able to interact with one another? Essentially this is done by building a "source" that interweaves different compilers No, that's not really correct. "Source" refers to the code, as opposed to the binary, executable programs a compiler produces from that code. In Python, we simply call `python` on the source, and it's compiled and run in one step. However in compiled languages like C, we do call a compiler to make our source code into an executable and then run that executable. "Compiling from source" refers to downloading the code and producing the executable yourself, as opposed to downloading a finished executable. Interoperability is acheived by a structure called "pipes". For example, the command `cat myfile.txt` outputs the contents of a file; `grep Name` will take any input and output only lines containing "Name"; and `wc -l` will count the lines of its input. So, to count the number of lines containing "Name" in "myfile.txt": `cat myfile.txt | grep Name | wc -l`. Each is a simple - almost trivial - program, but by combining them, it's easy to build complex behavior.

&gt; Of all of the computers I have ever bought in my life, besides the ones I built myself, there was never a cheaper "no Windows" option. Of all the flights I've ever taken in my life, there has never been a cheaper "no pilots" option. That doesn't mean the pilots' salary isn't part of the ticket price.
I think you are mistaken, but I'm curious as to why you've come to this conclusion. Have you used Linux, or Mac OS?
DO is great. I prefer AWS for a lot of things, but I will say Digital Ocean is incredibly easy for people who haven't worked with cloud computing before.
(Don’t know if a framework counts, but...) Django, not because I use it a lot nowadays, but it taught me a lot of design patterns that I use in my day to day work.

Rebound looks awesome but struggling to see when I'd choose to use it vs just googling for a stack. Anyone use it here?
The first one just doing it was the best part.
Shouldn't you be using the list "names" in the format statements, instead of "likes"?
I'm going to guess it's either something scientific research (like physics), or maybe manipulation of sound or images? I'm going to make a fool of myself.
Actually best explanation for me what is machine learning. Thanks! Good job BTW :)
Well, I suppose images gets you half credit! I do software for art installations and use NumPy for generating frame data to send to LED arrays.
Interesting. Does this make joins less obnoxious? I don't understand how the whole root/anchor eliding thing is convenient in any circumstance and I keep stumbling on it, especially on windows. Like: Path('/foo', '/bar') ends up being `/bar` which I think is absurd. Half the time I'm getting paths from random places out of my control and coding around this scenario is a hassle. I copy around a function (this is at work so i dunno what it is exactly) def path_join(prefix: Path, suffix: Path) -&gt; Path: suffix = suffix.relativeto(suffix.anchor) return Path(prefix, suffix) or am I missing something really obvious about joining paths in pathlib
I think if your working with Mostly Linux based environments you should should a Linux based os. If your working with windows environments then used a windows machine. The differences are minor but annoying, dir vs ls. How os.path works. I have a project I’m working on that will be running on windows servers, so I had to use a windows virtual machine to code on just so I don’t have to debug issues remotely. Besides that, I don’t think they will be much of a problem using either. Just switching between the two might be troublesome. I will note, that I’ve had experience using packages that were not just supported on windows.
I know I use python for sysadmin stuff and random funsy web projects and all the chatter about numpy and pandas always gets me feeling out of the loop
Please upload this to github
No, it IS a hassle. But path.py shines, as you see in the example. Also, it puts the path string as the representative of the object. So inserting a path object into any other function that just wants a path string, it will behave as it should.
**Stand-ups**: it's *supposed* to be a short meeting where the whole team is, well, standing up, and discussing what you've been doing yesterday, what you're gonna be working on today, and if there are any blockers. In practice, we have some remote workers on the team, so it's usually a video call sitting down. **Structure**: currently, honestly, kind of neither - Airflow pipelines, which are in a bit of a grey area. You could argue it's a program that happens to run some scripts. It's definitely very much *engineered*, with proper modularization, layers of testing, a focus on maintainability, scale, and keeping things stateless. Then some of the jobs in it use some scripts that run in a separate process altogether; not all of them are even in Python. **Solo-ing**: both; I've been attached to a team but having my own fiefdom of half an ETL/analysis pipeline project, and I have been working freelance for a bunch of different clients. So, definitely exists, but I'm not sure how viable it would be for you - it's a tough market, and I had the luxury of low costs of living on my side.
That doesn't make any sense; first, you can't fly without a pilot, just like you can't use a PC without an OS. Second, you're ignoring the 2nd part where I mention Microsoft's contract with PC manufacturers where they get their pay regardless of what OS is installed. By simply buying a computer, in most cases you are already paying Microsoft's cut. Therefore, regardless of which OS you choose you are paying the same price. Maybe some of the contracts are different going forward, but for most PC's that's the case currently.
I really appreciate giving me a direction to head after sololearn. That's extremely helpful doing this stuff without a teacher or a guide is frustrating
Coursera and edx have very good courses/specializations from top tier universities.
Dunno, delete all those pyc files as root and try again. Either that or your certificate\_transparency.py file is corrupted, you should reinstall python-cryptography Write down your installed version you get with: su - apt-cache policy python-cryptography Then purge the package: apt-get remove python-cryptography --purge And install it with (use your version instead of mine): apt-get install python-cryptography=2.1.4-1ubuntu1.2
Hey Can you post your error message? And I think you need one more elif statement where and X people like it too is variable At the moment you don't support more than four likes but the last sentence in the description says if there are more than 4 '2 more' changes appropriately
Have you tried PornHub?
if you haven't used firefox in the last 6 months you shouldn't be saying anything. Technology moves fast. That's like saying you used an Intel cpu 20 years ago and it was shit. Therefore Intel CPUs today are shit. The People at Mozilla have been working on firefox HARD. They have some of the smartest minds there currently and Firefox will become the most popular browser in the next 5 years. Few are going to use corrupt and data stealing/selling Google who discontinues all their products every 4 years. Nobody is going to use Brave or any other niche super tech literate browser. Even Microsoft Edge is going to beat Google in the near future.
.... Microsoft is adopting chromium. Mozilla doesn't have the funding to compete with Google and that's reflected in the market share (chrome by a landslide and growing).
dynaconf to manage configurations. `pip install dynaconf`
I don't think we disagree on the facts here. _The fact that a cost is hard to avoid does not make it go away._ Just because a lot of people end up being forced to give Microsoft money doesn't mean they didn't give Microsoft money.
Nice work!!!!
Sure, but I'm saying the price of Linux is irrelevant because you don't actually save money by using it. Going back to my "new" laptop, I'm installing Fedora 29 on it right now, it came with Windows 10 Pro, and the fact that Windows 10 Pro costs $199 from Microsoft and Fedora 29 is free has no impact on how much money I actually pay for the computer and does not effect my choice
Why does funding matter when choosing a browser if they have the same features?
No, you missed the point in the example. You have to change and set environmental variables manually in windows. Changing backend from theano to keras is an example I remembered.
I buy all my hardware used (used ThinkPads are a blessing tbh) or from manufacturers (like System76) that don't have Microsoft contracts. So yes, maybe it has no effect on you, but that doesn't mean that discussing it pointless.
These sorts of things really won't matter. Just concentrate on learning to write code.
Yes I love Thinkpads too, the laptop I just picked up was a used X240. Seems like they pretty much always come with Windows 10 Pro though. Whenever I see machines that come with Linux or are Linux first, they seem to be slightly more expensive then comparable mass produced Windows machines? I don't know, I just have trouble seeing the "Linux is cheaper" argument holding water the way things are now, especially now that Windows 10 is supported like forever and runs really well on 6 year old laptops. For example looking at System76, they need to have kernel developers on staff. That can't be cheap.

Yeah Reader and iCloud Keychain are the only things keeping me in Safari
How does fame feel like?
Yeah definitely. I'm not sure what you mean about path string though, I guess I've only used path in standard library functions and stuff I made where either I know it's a Path or I verify and cast as necessary. Can you provide an example?
Well, such a thread has to have pytest in it..
Lol it’s alright

Yeah, I was wondering the same thing. The Python 3 Complete Masterclass (by Mihai) at udemy looks tempting, but I'm not 100% certain whether to participate. If anybody here can give feedback it'd be appreciated!
Check this out. p1 = Path("/usr") p2 = Path("/bin") p3 = p1 + p2 print(p3) #&gt; /usr/bin Notice how printing the object gives you only the path of the object. If you put the object in a list though, you get this: mylist = [p1, p2, p3] print(mylist) #&gt; [Path('/usr'), Path('/bin'), Path('/usr/bin')]

This isn't exactly what you're looking for but if you're doing quantitative analysis this may be of interest to you. https://www.quantopian.com
Do you think this process can be adapted to the situation where the ball’s x_speed is higher than the paddle’s x_speed? Maybe you could make the paddle start predicting where the ball is likely to land next? Maybe by adding a score penalty for extra paddle movements? Something like: penalty = (sum of all paddle movements between paddle bounces)/(minimum required paddle movement) - 1.

 I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you're referring to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I've recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX. Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called "Linux", and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project. There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine's resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU/Linux. All the so-called "Linux" distributions are really distributions of GNU/Linux.
Awesome.
This bot now owes me $0.01 in wasted bandwidth.
cryptography. Especially the X.509 modules/classes.
I have never programmed before in my life but decided I wanted to start. I've been watching this ~4 and a half hour video on youtube and I just know the very basics. Been pretty cool so far and really excited to see where this goes.
The few times I messed around with project ideas linked by one of these articles the project was abandoned. Required significant retooling to function. I question whether the digital media blogger putting out these projects actually worked on it or simply grabs a few things that look interesting, slap some words and photos around it, and hits publish without any understanding of the work.
It's the most incredible hands down. Also very fast. Great for one offs and great for production code. A true Swiss army knife of a library
Great video dude. Very well explained and straight to the point. I can see your channel growing as large as codebullet or carykh in no time. I just checked the project on github and the codes looking really good. Now you've got nn's and genetics working once, you can easily pass your skills onto another project. Isn't learning fun :) Also, if you end up falling in love with pygame like i did. I recommend reading the [Newbie Guide](https://www.pygame.org/docs/tut/newbieguide.html), specifically the dirty rect part. It'll allow the simulation to run at 100's of frames per second instead of the 28fps limit on pygame.display.flip() Keep being epic :)

If this were my requirement I would probably use python to get the bits I wanted out of Gmail and send it to ELK and use Kibana for my dashboard. There are a lot of good YouTube vids on ELK and how to get data in (wouldn't be surprised to see a python library now that I'm thinking about it) and even more videos on how to make your dashboard. Let us know how it goes!
I was so proud of the lil guy
Omg bro this means a lot to me Just want to impact lives Don’t worry you’ll make it there one day
I'm interested in hearing more about your job. Would you mind giving more details?
Excellent. Thanks buddy. It worked with both either using python command or by changing the default application. Thanks once again for your quick help. Now, I will concentrate on Excel manipulations and I am sure I will come back for way more questions :)
I just took a quick look at the doc and I think listerner should be capitalized, i.e . \`with keyboard.Listener(on\_press=on\_press, on\_release=on\_release) as listener:\` &amp;#x200B; [https://pynput.readthedocs.io/en/latest/keyboard.html#monitoring-the-keyboard](https://pynput.readthedocs.io/en/latest/keyboard.html#monitoring-the-keyboard)
Good evening friend. You simply forgot to import "Listener" from pynput.keyboard. Your program is trying to figure out what you're referring to when you call "Listener", but since you haven't imported it, it doesn't know what it is!
got it. Thanks. For next time will do so
Check out the second example here: [https://pythonhosted.org/pynput/keyboard.html](https://pythonhosted.org/pynput/keyboard.html) You need to import Listener: `from pynput.keyboard import Key, Listener` not Controller.listener
Just call it async? It's mildly annoying, but really not a big deal to handle the async slightly higher up.
Thank you very much for the help! I will use hastebin from now on, I’m still pretty green! Much appreciated :)
Thanks to this video I just watched all of 3blue1brown's machine learning videos.
are you bad at humor or bad at snark? it's hard to tell

Hmm did this and still seem to get the same “‘Controller’ object has no attribute ‘Listener’” error
Firstly, on the "we are assuming CPython" part, I said that *after* saying most people only use CPython nowadays. And I'm not assuming people don't use other implementations, and I am right to assume that 95% of people use CPython or a derivative, if not 99% at this point. PyPy is very active in development but *not* in production due to ongoing stability issues and incompatiblities. Secondly, Python objects can be accessed and dereferenced, and there is a pointer type for them. import ctypes a = object() # or any Python obejct really. a_p = ctypes.cast(id(a), ctypes.py_object) a_dereffed = a_p.value a is a_dereffed # True See [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html#ctypes.py_object) for more information. This works because `id` gets the value as a Python `int`, which is casted to the relevant pointer type.
Uh also pretty sure its just called as Listener rather than keyboard.listener. Updated the code here: https://hastebin.com/ayasecomas.py
What's really the point of that anyways? Am I really the only person who prefers typing \`python myfile.py\`?
Thank you again! That was the issue, I had keyboard.listener working well now!!! :)
I am working on a text based RPG. I followed [Bryan Tong's tutorials on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n0_vndSuYM). Anyone have an opinion on what I should do next, or other tutorial videos I could use? I plan to make this game very stat and mechanic heavy.
I can often run a pandas scripts and get results faster than opening the excel file. that led me to contributing to the project.
Username checks out.
I don't know, maybe it never happened and it's me imaging things. What I am sure about is that I installed right now Pandas on Win 10 for the nth time. No problem at all.
Wonderful! Meanwhile I'm still stuck on Level 1 data analysis...

Genetic Algorithm != Neural Network. They're two completely different things...
I think the fact that it evolves makes it a genetic algorithm. Look into Neuro-evolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT)
testCoefs is not defined anywhere line 214
No a genetic algorithm has to be specifically self-modifying. You're not modifying the algorithm automatically, you're doing it manually.
Do you want to do this for reasons of playing around with the concept and working on algorithms to break the key, or are you just trying to shrink the size of the keys involved to make them more practical? 1024b RSA keys are already too small. Numbers of that size can be factored with an amount of resources not entirely out of reach today, at least with the wrong parameters; it's not a good choice. 512b or, God forbid, 256b RSA keys would be catastrophically weak. The resources required to factor a 512b key cost circa &lt;$100 on AWS; for 256b, you could probably do it at home. PyCrypto is trying to protect you. If you're doing this out of curiosity, I would say look for a general math library and implement the math yourself, that would actually be quite interesting. If you actually want smaller keys, then for the love of God don't do this. Use Ed25519, it's immensely superior on close to every level.
There's a reason why it only supports keys of size of &gt;1024, smaller keys are unsafe. Even 1024-bit keys are being deprecated. When it comes to security, it's generally a good idea to stick to the standards and use the most well tested libraries.
eeyyyyy\~ good fren
For the reasons of playing around. To be exact, I’m testing out a concept, where authentication process between two devices consists of applying multiple encryption algorithms. RSA is the heaviest one, and I’m drastically speeding up the key exchange process by shirking key size.
Really interesting!
I participated in a hackathon HackAMU, held at my college in which we develop realtime smart attendance system using facial recognition. The technologies we used were firebase realtime database, python flask, and nuxt.js.
True, I had deleted testCoefs thinking they weren't used anywhere. I'll add it back in.
Nice work!
Meaning the structure of the neural network itself would have to self-modify?
I wonder what happened if you made the paddle slower than the ball. It would have to somehow predict where the ball would go in order to be close enough to get there in time.
Yes I think its a typo. Lol
I wouldn't do this computation in python. &amp;#x200B; When I have built ETLs like this in the past I have used airflow. But that is just the scheduler. The work is done by the databases, they are way faster. I would just dump the mongo data directly into postgres -- don't use json blobs just convert it to a simple schema -- then do the transformation with a postgres query. &amp;#x200B; Maybe you have too many users to make this fast in postgres? Then in that case try a more column oriented database for your BI like redshift or google bigquery.
Yes, I know that. But either way, for this project I’d like to proceed with lighter computation.
and add pls "from math import *" to use math functions

Amazing video thank you!
I love you, this made me laugh for like 5 minutes
I would recommend not suggesting people to do `pip3 install anything` on Linux. Too likely to break something. Also, it would be helpful to specify which versions of Python you're targeting.
&gt; I know it's not a Python question Then why would you ask in a Python subreddit?
I had no place to ask.
I find that unlikely to say the least.
You use the term “lowest capacity” several times, but that implies a server that has the least capacity, as in least room for more connections, which sounds like the opposite of what you’d tend to want to connect to. Also at a glance this seems to have some _questionable_ password handling, as it appears to save the user’s auth details in a plaintext file in the installation directory of the script, which could be anywhere and have any permissions. Lastly if you’re trying to improve your code I’d suggest running this through _pylint_ and having a good long read at all the errors. And personally I’d use **psutil** for the process management, rather than shelling out to awk and grep.

r/linuxquestions
 I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you're referring to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I've recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX. Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called "Linux", and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project. There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine's resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU/Linux. All the so-called "Linux" distributions are really distributions of GNU/Linux.
Here's a sneak peek of /r/linuxquestions using the [top posts](https://np.reddit.com/r/linuxquestions/top/?sort=top&amp;t=year) of the year! \#1: [I just caught someone “inside” my linux laptop...what were they doing?](https://np.reddit.com/r/linuxquestions/comments/b3wfej/i_just_caught_someone_inside_my_linux_laptopwhat/) \#2: [Why is ls returning penis](https://np.reddit.com/r/linuxquestions/comments/9ylegj/why_is_ls_returning_penis/) \#3: [Favorite Linux Terminal Tricks](https://np.reddit.com/r/linuxquestions/comments/apx4yf/favorite_linux_terminal_tricks/) ---- ^^I'm ^^a ^^bot, ^^beep ^^boop ^^| ^^Downvote ^^to ^^remove ^^| [^^Contact ^^me](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=sneakpeekbot) ^^| [^^Info](https://np.reddit.com/r/sneakpeekbot/) ^^| [^^Opt-out](https://np.reddit.com/r/sneakpeekbot/comments/afd0dd/blacklist/)
The way ipvanish displays their server is 0% capacity means 0% used, 100% capacity is completely full. Yeah password handler could be better maybe with a tmpfile and prompt the user when needed. This is why I made sure to put that info in the readme until I decide to tackle it. I have played with psutils before it's not bad. Those parts of the program where written log ago. Plus at the time I needed some experience with subprocess since it came as part of the standard lib and work took forever to approve FOSS. Thanks for your comments and trust me I know it is still a work in progress.
RSA sucks. If you're going to shrink the keys below 1024b, you are just about better off not encrypting at all. I still recommend Ed25519, the libraries for it are extremely good (see: [ed25519.cr.yp.to](https://ed25519.cr.yp.to/), [libsodium](https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium)). Verification may be slightly slower than RSA in theory, but they batch well and might in fact be faster for your use case. I would recommend actually benchmarking it. As an additional benefit, key generation is so fast it's almost trivial.
I’d just explain the inversion of the meaning of “capacity” better, since ipvanish is misusing the term. A low % capacity in their case actually means the server has low usage and high capacity. For the auth details you don’t have to use a tempfile, but you should at least save the file in an appropriate location in the user’s XDG_HOME_DIR, not the install directory of the script. And realistically you shouldn’t save them at all, they should either be in the environment, be in a config file in XDG_CFG_DIR that the user creates and controls, or is asked for once in your program and then discarded. As is you’re leaking their credentials and they likely won’t know about it. And yeah it’s fine that it’s a work in process, but **pylint** will point out some places that could use focus, like the exception handling (naked `except:` _bad_).
3blue1brown has machine learning videos other than the ones about Neural Networks?
Why not use gradient descent instead of randomly nudging weights?
Dude, I wasn't really asking about alternatives. There's a protocol I'm implementing, and it requires RSA with a small key, and I need help putting it together. Unfortunately someone has decided that Python developers are dumb, and it's totally necessary to force-cap the key size, and I need a workaround. &amp;#x200B; So here's my idea. Thinking about how *caring* Python community is (considering people dumb by default), I looked into another languages. My key generation part is going to be in Ruby, since OpenSSL has no cap on key size what so ever. It's not going to slow my solution down, since key generation is not a part of benchmark. &amp;#x200B; P.S. Sorry, if I appeared rude, I didn't mean to. Just trying to solve a specific problem ;)
Can I trade stocks? Just say forex
Consider me butthurt, but here's what Ruby's documentation has to say on this: ```new(key_size) =&gt; RSA instance ... Generates or loads an` [`RSA`](https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.5.3/libdoc/openssl/rdoc/OpenSSL/PKey/RSA.html) `keypair. If an integer key_size is given it represents the desired key size. Keys less than 1024 bits should be considered insecure.``` It gives me guidance on what is considered secure and what is not, however, it does not stop me from doing what I _want_ to do. I challenge PyCrypto maintenance team to stop putting restrictions on developers, and instead of that, throw warnings if something is considered a bad practice. Pardon me again.
