What's the problem with your method?
You could post it to https://repl.it/ and then we could all play it!
1. /r/learnpython 2. Rewrite your script to scrape to a database like PostgreSQL and run it using Cron or systemd timers; then look into something like Flask to get the data out of the database and present it on a web page. You can also offer CSV downloads easily if you want.
It's for r/learnpython for next time There are 3 solutions I would recommend: Make a public google doc with the code in it Use github Or Host a website for free on neocities.org.
i started when i was 13, im now 15 and if you carry on you can do great, i recommend if you are interested in making games to check out the pyglet module, keep that for the future though
I already use Github and know how to host sites the problem is sharing the code with 5000 of my coworkers, would prefer to just have the final data accessible since that is all that they need.
It's been mine for over a decade now :|
I used datarc bootstrap theme, there’s plenty awesome free themes available html5up.net!
Can you use smtp to auto email them the file?
You tried your best

There are other awesome online notebooks like collab, azure notebooks and even jupyterlab site has one The goal is for me to provide truly free computational power with no sign ups, better specs and no data logging
&gt; The Python community has been nothing but supportive of me, throughout my journey. Mwahah. From the guy who opened a new subreddit when he was taking a bit of fire from this one. I’be ready to bet decent money someone else wrote all the non-technical bits of this. It’s too late anyway; too many have seen the first draft, which showed the real guy. This is just damage limitation.
100% - you don’t know it yet but you need it (or something similar)
It sounds like that wiki page could do with an update! In terms of current python practice it is now seventeen (count them) years out of date. Someone I respect told me about four years ago that there was still nothing else that covered the range of technologies, but alas it's too old to have a lot of relevant Python in it. I see second-hand copies available at reasonable prices, so you might want to acquire one for the discussion of web technologies and architectures. Much that has been layered on top of the basics in the intervening years is simply not covered, though you should have the tools and knowledge to understand it all. &amp;#x200B; I'm not planning to write a successor. The field is now so broad that it would be hard to even select and adequate set of topics. Or maybe when I retire ...
&gt; do you have a tutorial on SDK development for Python? It was my intention to write a multi-part guide on creating good Python SDKs (Modules) for Web REST APIs. I started on a rough draft, but have been side-lined by other projects as of late. If I were to create a guide, would you prefer a video or a written document? I ask because videos are super popular these days. Though I feel like code is still better written out than as video.
Thanks a lot TREVOR
Good for you, I began programming at that age as well- it has made an immeasurable difference in the difficulty of my CS classes. Rock on!
Nice work. Look up the lemonade stand game. Play through it a few times to understand how it works and then try to do it in Python! It's not as hard as you might think.
I feel you my friend, I started with QBasic
A good (yet old) tutorial for PyGame is [this](https://youtu.be/ujOTNg17LjI) by sentdex.

Mathematically, quicksort, recursive or not, it one of the best general purpose sorting algorithms. I would suggest revisiting your implementation, it likely has bugs. I would first look at how you choose a pivot. A common mistake is to pick a bad pivot or try to sort a nearly sorted collection and end up with an O(n) time.
That's Visual Basic Script (VBS), my friend. Visual Basic would be tolerable. VBS is a different (and unfriendly) beast. (well, unfriendly, imho.) So anyway, I'm digging thru Adobe's website right now to find out more about their APIs. They've got some interesting things here.
Here's an impl of my main man Ramanujan's method ``python import math def pi(precision): k = 0 previous = 0.0 current = 0.0 while k is 0 or previous is 0.0 or abs((1 / current) - (1 / previous)) / 12 &gt; precision: previous = current dividend = pow(-1, k) * math.factorial(6 * k) * (13591409 + 545140134 * k) divisor = math.factorial(3 * k) * pow(math.factorial(k), 3) * pow(640320, 3 * k + 3.0 / 2) current += dividend / divisor k = k + 1 print (current, 1.0 / (12.0 * current)) return 1 / (12 * current) ```
Looks like someone has already created a Python lib: https://github.com/lohriialo/photoshop-scripting-python
Any tips to get my 13 year old brother into programming?
I wouldn't return the function. A simple option would be to enclose the whole game logic (the logic inside the function) with a while true loop.
I likely have a "nearly sorted" problem. My agents basically have two data inputs, with each input being a 1 or 0. If the data inputs are the same I would expect the output to be 1. If not then they are 0. This results in about 90% of my agents fitness scores being 2 of a possible 4. With the remaining 10% being 1 or 3 for the score, and a vast minority being 4. Perhaps my simulation is not optimized for the quicksort algorithm. Are there better sorting algorithms for this sort of task?
Big yikes. I remember the if chain days. You'll look back on this code in the future and laugh. Happy coding. This is the start of your coding career.
I have an informal rule that anyone who actually posts code gets an upvote.
In that case i would probably go with insertion sort since your data is already mostly sorted. You just want to be smart about your comparisons so if data[i] &gt;= data[i -1] you skip over data[i] reducing your number of comparisons.
Me too! writeln LOL!
This gives me deja vu to my early days of progamming. Good times
Bravo👏👏
When I was 13, I wrote php in notepad.exe But always a good idea to get used to git, it drives me insane that every other group member in college projects never even heard of git. (Computer Science and am just before graduating)
I would prefer written just because as a developer I can read faster and learn faster than watching a video. A lot of people do prefer the video format and it has its advantages. What I think of first is: you can see the natural growth of the cod and for people who are Very new to a new topic, it helps. But I think I can manage with a very well written article. In the meantime, do you have any tips or any other tutorials you would recommend?
Try to use Exceptions for cases that are illegal. I am referring to the „There must have been a glitch“-Case.
Second this, I made the same experience when applying for internships.
I'd say don't force it, tell him about it and some of the cool things he could do with it. See if he's interested, if he isn't genuinely passionate about it then there's no point
IMO it is a sin to make one's project such that `pip install -r requirement.txt` will *not* get someone up and running. It's easy to forget that good old `requirements.txt` itself supports version lock syntax, as well as hash locking. To abandon `requirements.txt` is to be a bad workflow neighbor, requiring other developers or end users to use the same extra tools you do, for no good reason. These are the primary reasons I prefer [pip-tools](https://github.com/jazzband/pip-tools/), which does its business in "source" files (like `requirements.in`) which get "compiled" to the old standard `requirements.txt` files, which everyone can use immediately with standard Python tooling. No one *else* has to use `pip-tools` just to install the requirements. [Flit](https://github.com/takluyver/flit) is a good independent `pyproject.toml` generator, package builder, and PyPI publisher tool. To make `pip-tools` more convenient, I use a [set of aliases](https://github.com/AndydeCleyre/dotfiles/blob/master/.python.zshrc) that I encourage everyone to check out. I recently added a script in there to populate `pyproject.toml` requirements fields, assigning them to separate requirements groups (e.g. "dev", "testing", etc.) if they are split across different `*requirements.in` files. If some task seems impossible or confusing using those aliases, please ask me about it.
amazing
Borland Delphi Pascal 6.0 was mine at 14.
Don't you also need tcl/tk installed for tkinter? Last time I checked, at least on Linux, you need to install that separately. Never tried on Windows, though, so it might be bundled with the Python installer.
It's if you have a recursive algorithm, but then you need to design that correctly. Or, if you have tail call optimization, which I don't believe Python has.
your README is severely lacking

Stop using screenshots and start using Github. That way not only we can pull your code and give you advices directly in your code, but also you will never lose your code if you lose your computer data. If you are only 13 years old, it's a good practise to start.
Could you give an example of what you mean by expanding an answer?
How is that possible??
`my_list = [(1,2,3), (4,5,6), (7,8,9)]` `for triple in my_list:` `print(triple)` When your iterable contains other iterables like lists or tuples, you can declare multiple variables left of the \`in\` operator to unpack that list or tuple `for x, y, z in my_list:` `print(x, y, z)` You can do the same with the \`zip\` function to create tuples of multiple iterables on the fly instead of constructing a list of tuples beforehand. `for x, y, z in zip(range(1,4), range(4,7), range(7,10)):` `print(x, y, z)`
thank you
Another thing is generally inputs are all at the very top of the file. It's not that important, but you could move your import for random to the top.
Even better than a comment is a link to something like trinket.io You can make a trinket even without an account although it is easier if you have a (free) account.
I don't know what the columns mean unfortunately or what they're trying to describe
&gt; I wrote php in notepad.exe That's how I started 15 years ago. *Really* wish I had some of that stuff still.
In principle yes, OCR could read the text in images, but in practice no. See [the sidebar here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Blind/).
Why not use the sort function built into Python, like this? import random import time print("creating ransom scores") score_tuples = list() for key in range(100000): score = random.randint(1,4) score_tuples.append((key, score)) print("scores are created") start_time = time.time() sorted_tuples = sorted(score_tuples, key=lambda score: score[1]) print("scores are sorted", time.time() - start_time) On my "competent" laptop, the sorting of 100,000 scores takes about 0.015 seconds. We might be able to help you more if you show us your code.
I’m not experienced at all so I might be wrong but I don’t think calling your function again after you receive an invalid input is right. Rather use a whole loop until you receive a valid input.
Gotta love zip, helps so much! I recently needed to iterate through 2 dictionary k/v pairs at once, it wasn't working until I realized that I needed to use tuples. The original context was a little abstract, so I've captured a nonsense for loop to illustrate my point. (I fully get that there are better ways to execute the following operation.) for (k1,v1),(k2,v2) in zip(dict1.items(), dict2.items()): print(max(v1,v2)) Nonetheless, zipping two dictionaries together requires 2 tuples. It's a neat trick when you need it!
BTW, I found this answer using DuckDuckGo, with the search term "python sort", on the first item in the search results, called ["HowTo/Sorting - Python Wiki"](https://wiki.python.org/moin/HowTo/Sorting)

By the elif, is that the same as using ‘or’ ?
OOP.
actually I have lot of work to do. !RemindMe tomorrow.
Notice how the code that they posted stored a list of strings for each condition instead of a single item, that way you can put however many you like in...
They don't teach it?
 import random d = dict() d['a'] = ['aardwolves','abacterial','abandoners','abandoning',] d['b'] = ['babbitting','babblement','babesioses','babesiosis',] d['z'] = ['zabaglione','zamindaris','zaninesses','zapateados',] ch = input("enter a character: ") x = random.choice(d[ch]) print (x)
Keep up the good work! Many constructive things have been said. I don’t think I’ve seen this yet so: try separating your code into different distinct functions and get an IDE like visual studio code or whichever suits your taste :)
All recursive functions can be written as loops. Sometimes recursion isn't the answer.
Not hating, it's cool stuff, but why is there a need to post an age when doing python? I dont understand.
The Python builtin [`sorted()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#sorted) function uses [Timsort](https://skerritt.blog/timsort-the-fastest-sorting-algorithm-youve-never-heard-of/), which is most likely the best possible sort for your data.
He did by including "dynamite" in the lose conditions for rock.
Yeah, I was using notepad for PERL when I was 13. My mind was blown once I figured out I could use another program and get syntax highlighting.
No. One is a logical comparison the other is a part of a control flow statement.
Congratulations!!!!! &amp;#x200B; I wrote my first real game in 1976 or 1977. It was based on the "Eliza" psychotherapist programs that were one of the first attempts at AI. It would pretend to be a psychotherapist and ask you how you feel. If you say for example, "I feel sad", it would respond with "Why do you think you feel sad?" So it would look for keywords or in the example above, it would look for patterns of text. It would know that if you said "I feel ..." that the next word was an emotion and pull up one of several stock replies and shove in the emotion in the right place. &amp;#x200B; By having enough responses and enough keywords you could get natural sounding responses. Of course since it didn't actually know the meaning of words or remember the previous thing it said, it could be quite nonsensical. &amp;#x200B; It was an Apple IIe and ran a version of Basic. Lots of fun. &amp;#x200B; Keep doing what your doing!
It's a valid recursive strategy, but if you get too many invalid inputs you'll overflow the stack and the program will crash.
Nice, I started when I was 12. Now I am 15 and have an internship. Keep going.
Good job! It's all downhill from here!
Nice work, I did something similar with a batch script when I was 12 or so, good memories.
This is great! To give you an idea of how to progress, namely making things modular so you can expand them only by changing config, here's how I (as a professional python dev) would write this: import random moves = { "rock": { "beats": { "lizard", "scissors" } }, "paper": { "beats": { "rock", "spock" } }, "scissors": { "beats": { "lizard", "paper" } }, "lizard": { "beats": { "paper", "spock" } }, "spock": { "beats": { "rock", "scissors" } } } lose_count = 0 win_count = 0 playing = True def rps(): global lose_count global win_count global playing player_answer = "" while player_answer not in moves.keys(): player_answer = input(f"To play, type in any of these: {', '.join(moves.keys())}! To quit, type quit.\n\n").lower() if player_answer == "quit": playing = False return if player_answer not in moves.keys(): print(f"Please make a valid selection! Valid selections are {', '.join(moves.keys())}!") computer_answer = random.choice(list(moves.keys())) if computer_answer in moves[player_answer]["beats"]: print(f"\nYou win! The computer chose {computer_answer}. Congratulations!") win_count += 1 else: print(f"\nYou lose! The computer chose {computer_answer}, sorry!") lose_count += 1 print(f"Current scores: {win_count} wins, {lose_count} losses.\n") print(f"Welcome to {', '.join([x.title() for x in moves.keys()])}!") while playing: rps() print(f"Thanks for playing! Final scores: {win_count} wins, {lose_count} losses.") The intention here isn't to correct you, it's to show you what it would look like so you can research parts you don't understand and improve :)
Is there a specific one(s) I can help you with?
&gt;Twillio program to receive local football league results via SMS and place them in a Google sheet when they have been verified What cell service is your phone using? You might be able to do it without paying for twilio.

Great job! I wish i started this young! Keep up the good effort!
Idk why people are obsessed with the age thing in the title...
what i have currently
It's pretty strange because my middle school still uses Pascal. It's not that bad though, but I definitely prefer more modern languages!
The *really nasty* hate was to Guido personally, but right here directly below your comment (as I see it) we can see examples of Redditors making utterly bogus bullshit statements about the introduction of the assignment operator: - "ignoring the general opinion on the core developers mailing list" -- that's untrue^1, the feedback including negative feedback was listened to, nobody was ignored. And at least one core dev, Tim Peters, was an extremely vocal and persuasive proponent of the new syntax. - "forcing the assignment expression PEP through" -- its the job of the BDFL to make a final decision. Any decision is going to disappoint some subset of the community. This was no more forced through than any other decision to accept or reject a PEP, including such controversial ones as the @ syntax for decorators, annotations, and even True/False constants. - "The Python-2-forever crowd ran roughshod for almost ten years" -- that's just a fantasy with literally zero basis in reality. I mean, honestly, that's like talking about the British royal family being space reptiles, and meaning it seriously. - Guido "was shutting down honest debate" --the discussion went on and on and on and on for *months* over literally thousands of emails on two mailing lists. Every piece of feedback, whether positive or negative, was considered, and the PEP went through multiple drafts reflecting that feedback, but eventually the "debate" just devolved to people objecting with the same tired old objections and opinions over and over and over again as if they hadn't been answered twenty times before: Person A: "We should use `as` instead." PEP author: "We can't use `as` because it is ambiguous and will lead to problems. The PEP already explains why, but let me explain in detail..." A week later: Person B: "We should use `as` instead." Person A: "Yes, I agree, let's use `as`." PEP author: "We can't use `as` because it is ambiguous and will lead to problems. See the PEP for the details." A week later: Person C: "We should use `as` instead. Person A: "Yes, I agree." PEP author: "We can't use `as` like I've already said. Please read the archives **or the PEP** for detailed reasons." Person B: "We should just use `as`." I won't link to the comments, but if you search for keywords on the page you'll find them. They've been quite highly upvoted for writing 100% fake facts and bullshit. ^1 I initially called it a goddamn lie but I'll be charitable, perhaps the person misrepresenting what happened is just ignorant rather than dishonest. He or she should spend a day or two reading over the entire multiple threads in the Python-Dev and Python-Ideas lists before commenting about things they know nothing about.
So in this case only if the user is trying to break the program ? Do you know any better strategies ?
Give it the command to operate a tactical nuke
is it though
Are you saying ‘or’ is part of a control flow statement ?
On windows/Mac tkinter is included as a basic gui package Just import tkinter https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html If youre on Linux you may need to install python tkinter separately from python in your package manager
Do you mean the any? Its similar in the effect but works differently. It's just a function that takes an iterable and returns true if any elements are truthy
They call it AWS Lambda! :D
Yes I did, thanks for the answer
In this case it's calling itself recursively even on success, so if you play long enough it will crash due to stack overflow. A better strategy would be to use a while loop. There are languages that won't overflow their stacks on recursion by doing tail call optimization, you can kind of [hack it into python](https://chrispenner.ca/posts/python-tail-recursion) but I wouldn't do that for production code.
Tip: put all your strings into a list: computerChoices = ("Rock", "Paper", Scissors") and then random.choice(computerChoices) &amp;#x200B; this is much more efficient than random integers.
Or is a logical comparison, elif is control flow.
My family couldn’t afford a compiler (well, sort of... it’s complicated) So when I was 13 I made do with what we had: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/GW-BASIC
VS Code recently added a variable explorer to their Python Interactive window that interfaces to Jupyter. It isn't quite as fluid as Spyder but isn't bad and VS Code is free. It also has great version control support - especially if you pick up GitLens
Yep the all function is similar but makes sure that all elements in the iterable are truthy https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#all https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#any You can also pass them generator expressions to get lazy behavior similar to and/or. Have you learned about generator expressions or object truthiness yet?
Way to go!! Congratulations!
I will check it out. Messing with the scientific mode on PyChram demo right now.
Great job with error handling. Well done!
I know of generators albeit just the basics but I have never even heard of object truthiness
The only major thing I would suggest is to move the imports to the top of the code. It just looks cleaner and when the code runs it won't try to import every time you run that sequence.
Of course, The alist is a one dimensional array of agent objects. Each object has a fitness score based on their performance in the simulation. the function will return a sorted array of agents from least fit, to most fit. def quickSort(alist): quickSortHelper(alist,0,len(alist)-1) return alist def quickSortHelper(alist,first,last): if first&lt;last: p = partition(alist,first,last) quickSortHelper(alist,first,p - 1) quickSortHelper(alist,p + 1,last) def get_pivot(alist, first, last): mid = (last + first) // 2 pivot = last if alist[first].Fitness &lt; alist[mid].Fitness: if alist[mid].Fitness &lt; alist[last].Fitness: pivot = mid elif alist[first].Fitness &lt; alist[last].Fitness: pivot = first return pivot def partition(alist,first,last): pivotIndex = get_pivot(alist, first, last) pivotValue = alist[pivotIndex].Fitness alist[pivotIndex], alist[first] = alist[first], alist[pivotIndex] border = first for i in range(first, last+1): if alist[i].Fitness &lt; pivotValue: border +=1 alist[i].Fitness, alist[border].Fitness = alist[border].Fitness, alist[i].Fitness alist[first].Fitness, alist[border].Fitness = alist[border].Fitness, alist[first].Fitness return (border)
Good job! Check out `random.choice(["Rock", "Paper", "Scissor"])` I find that function much more fun to use.
I read that part. I also read this part: \&gt; You never want to do such a thing, unless you've done something especially grievous like commit credentials. I also disagree with the part you quoted. I will rebase willy-nilly on my own repos and not feel the least bit bad about it. They're my repos.
Why does age matter, still some clean code
Looking forward to testing it out! Thanks for putting this out there.
Lots of respect here. At 13 most kids barely find a drive to teach themselves a skill. Keep it up, I love it. I found that it is truly motivating when you start coding to automate your life. Got a project you can think of to fit the bill?
Here's my outline: 1. Use PostMan to get a handle on your REST API 2. Create a low-level REST adapter 3. Create strong data models 4. Create high level endpoint abstractions 5. Write your unit tests Apparently, I was planning on writing a 5-part article series, but have only written the first two parts. Unfortunately, this outline doesn't really tell you much as there are so many details to explain in each section.

Wow. Kudos bud. Very cool of you to put that out there for everyone to enjoy.
After print(secretWord) (which you might want to get rid of. Don't want to give away the answer before the game starts) you're going to want start a loop so the user can guess again. Right now they get one guess and the program terminates.
Step two on this link: [https://testflight.apple.com/join/XRjYzgMU](https://testflight.apple.com/join/XRjYzgMU) is giving me a "Safari cannot open the page because the address is invalid". Anyone else have trouble at the "Start Testing" step? &amp;#x200B; Actually, it just started working when I opened TestFlight in the background. &amp;#x200B; This looks sick btw!
Yes I plan to remove that after I have the input working I have it there now to skip guessing and finding correct letters. So I can guess one correct and one wrong instantly
As much as I love and use vim a lot, it's not an IDE no matter how much plugins and stuff you put in. It won't have debugging tools for instance that pycharm has
Made some edits
Sick!
Nah it makes sense to write your own class for rps choice and a custom comparison function.
If the values are 1,2,3,4 and there is no further sorting, just go through the list and toss them in bins?
Nice job dude, I started programming around that age but couldnt figure it out for a while. By the time I was 15 I was getting almost 100 in my comp sci class. Im now pursing a double degree in mechanical engineering and computing technology. Moral of the story, get ahead while youre young and when you actually are evaluated youll have a much better understanding than your colleagues, even if they know how to write the program, youll understand why it works better.
That's great!! Just keep coding. You're off to a great start.
Make it serve you butter.
Avoid the recursive calls in your code.
Good use case. However, it is a bit sneaky that you are depending on the dicts being ordered. Alternatively you could just zip(dict1.values(), dict2.values()) since you dont need the keys at all.
I mean, it doesn't really make a big difference in this case unless you're gonna play this game for a really long time. The limits \~ a few thousand, right? But yeah, this part is annoying for Python. It trips me up sometimes for contest programming. I really shouldn't be using python for it anyways.
Because you cannot find length of an integer. It has to be a string ! Don’t convert user input to int. Or use:- ln=len(str(Uinput))
 math.pi = math.tau / 2 FTFY
bruh
because fuck you look how young I am! i’m basically a prodigy.
Note that in `for` loops "in" is just a separator and is used to determine which variables are temporarily bound to the value obtained from the iterator. It should not to be confused with the membership test operator with the same name.
Tell him how much karma he’ll get if he posts his age on r/Python

Ooooh interesting titbit! Thank you.
&gt; And, yes, it does the same exact thing in Python 3.7.3 Not a fault with Python. Representing limited precision numbers accurately is a hard problem, and every design has multiple issues. https://floating-point-gui.de/basic/

Are you aware of mycroft.ai, also largely in python? On the ideas list, it depends on the niche you want to occupy. If 'general' then get inspired by Alexa skills store.

One piece of unsolicited advice (and I’d love to hear the community opinion on this): Follow whatever path keeps you excited about computer science. Just be careful not to move too quickly from one language/programming paradigm to the next. The deeper you dive on your first language (and Python is a great one to start with), the more you’ll learn about computer science in general, which will make it easier to apply these concepts when you branch out to other languages. It’s kinda like learning how to ask to go to the bathroom in ten different languages. Useful no doubt, but only for the specific problem at hand. One of the few ways programming languages are like real languages is that at their core, they all follow similar patterns and structures. If you can find a project you’re passionate about (Python, JS, or otherwise), dive in deep and don’t stop googling until you’ve solved the problem. The rules and concepts you pick up along the way will become ingrained in your memory without you ever realizing it. Then when you switch languages the syntax might be different, but the concepts will be the same. Just my two cents. Nice work here! I wish I would have started at your age!
For that many variables just write it over multiple lines and go by order, like you would have done if one of them was a collection type. Honestly, the labelling is only vanity output. You don’t need the fancy labels to be an effective debugger. It would be much better if they instead introduced a specialised `dprint` keyword. The `dprint` keyword would provide the same sort of labelling but would be more easily and quickly written: `dprint foo, bar, ...`. Not only would this provide the nice labeled output, it would also save a lot of typing and hence save time. This would be a much more exciting change. If they’re going to add something to aid debugging then it needs to be something that’s easy to quickly setup and tear down. Writing debugging lines is something that is done often, and having to type `print(f"{name=}")` is not going to be practical in thee long run. The new syntax is unlikely to stand the test of time. I can’t help but think that someone’s going to figure out the ergonomic disadvantages of typing out `print(f"{name=}")` each time you want debugging output and is going to propose a new debugging facility. If that happens then `f"{name=}"` will become a loose end builtin feature that everyone’s going to ignore and forget about. If they’re going to add a debugging convenience then they shouldn’t baby step on `f"{foo=}"` but instead jump directly to something that really is more convenient to use. To summarise my complaints, the new f-string debugging syntax: * is only useful for simple non-collection types. * encourages writing everything on one line which could lead one to have to backtrack when the line becomes too long. * is going to be a forgotten feature if a better alternative gets added. * if it gets deprecated then it’s going to harm the language. You’ll have people telling others not to use builtin feature X, because builtin feature Y has replaced it. * doesn’t save typing, ergo, doesn’t save time.
A package/module for everything! Thanks.
Eeeeh; just how many python projects are named Juno?
I like to explain this in terms of a simple analogy. In python for loop is like a special switch to a candy dispenser. You press the switch and the dispenser gives out candies one by one until they run out (or you decide to break because you're getting a sugar high). However the twist is that in the dispenser there may be single candy or a packet of candy (or packet of candy inside a packet and so on...:)). You can choose to get the whole packet by pressing a button OR if you prefer you can ask the machine to unwrap the packet and dispense individual candies. However you must have that many separate containers to hold the unpacked candies, otherwise the machine will throw an error "No candy for you!". In python world these candy dispensers are called iterators and they can be lists, tuples, strings, dictionaries and so on. There's some subtlety in what each iterator returns in a for loop (for example using only for key in dict returns the key of a dictionary). But the basic principle is the same, if the iterator returns a single value you can bind that to a single variable. If the iterator returns another iterable you can either bind that to a single variable or you can unpack it by using multiple variables. A great advantage of this scheme is that for example in a loop if you want to get both the index as well as element you can use enumerate function which returns a list of tuples containing the element and its index. For example `for i, elem in enumerate(somelist): print(i, elem)`.
because thats an easy code ?
I use PyCharm.
I use emacs. Which isnt ab ide, but it's what I'm fond of.
Why do you think you should use an IDE?
what others are there?
Nice, I’m 12 and I’m around your level, try messing around with pyGame, it’s super fun and easy
Hey! Good job! I started coding at 18, 5 years ago, and now I'm about to receive my degree in engineering, so by starting so young you are definitely in a good track. I'd totally recommend you to check the "requests" library in Python. With that you can get things from webservices and build really cool things. Once you get to the point where you can interact with the outside world, you'll be able to make amazing things. Also, since it seems that you already know the basic structures, it might be good to read about object oriented programming (OOP), and some good practices. That code could be improved a lot, making it a lot simpler to read, and to write. If you are interested in knowing how it would look, send me a PM and I can make you an example. Keep learning and doing things! Good luck
This question gets asked **all the time**. once already *today*. I understand executing a quick search is too much effort for most folks, but hell, all you had to do today was look down.
sorry
Sounds like you want a script w/ a cron job or a task queue or a small http server. You want to leave a python script in a known location and be able to add shit to it for when it runs? Idk what ya want.
Congrats! Come join a game jam
Digital Ocean and Linode are solid and have $5/mo plans. There’s probably cheaper out there, but really...$5/mo is pretty reasonable.
You want a bat file plus the windows task scheduler
Lots of people are hating on the if-chain design. They're wrong. When you have a small, fixed number of cases with simple logic, if-chains are the way to go. It keeps all of the logic local and readable. Factoring everything out into data structures makes the code unnecessarily complicated, which can impact both readability and performance. Don't abstract for the sake of abstraction. Only abstract when it adds value.
Python comes ready to run code from the command line. You write a file containing python ([`test.py`](https://test.py), say) with a text editor (vim or notepad) and run your code by doing `python` [`test.py`](https://test.py) on the command line. Python also comes with the minimal IDE called [IDLE](https://docs.python.org/3/library/idle.html). A complicated IDE is probably not a good idea for a beginner as you have to learn how to use the IDE when you are trying to learn python - an added load. In addition the IDE hides things from you that can trip you up. When you start to write python that handles file paths you trip over the problem of not knowing the directory the IDE is using to run your code, so it's really hard to open files using relative paths. We see questions about this all the time. In addition, IDEs often do things for you that trip you up when you need to run your code outside the IDE. IDLE does this when it prints the value of an expression for you. That's nice, but python doesn't do that when you run your code outside IDLE. Once you have learned python and get into actually using it for real work, you may decide you need an IDE. However, many people in that situation don't use IDEs. I never have, and I wrote python for ten years as part of my job.
wowzers thanks so much
Careful with JS. As toothpasteTom notes, don't move too quickly. I tried JS as my first language years ago and found it ridiculously frustrating. In hindsight, I realize I wasn't ready for it.
Thanks mate! Really appreciate the kind words
Yes I’m just shocked that by the third year of a CS degree students a) haven’t been taught git and b) haven’t had to use it for anything else in the meantime.
Nice job
I meant to say I don't understand what the name of each coulmn is referring to,
[🗜️⚡Compress files on the client side super fast using WASM. Supports GZIP, ZLIB and DEFLATE compression and decompression](https://github.com/drbh/wasm-flate) There are Flask powered examples in the example repo! 🔋 batteries included
unfortunately cron and task queues is not available in my extremely restrictive dev environment otherwise def the goto. I want to hack together an always on python script that checks for the existence of a file containing a command, If file exists execute its contents e.g ( ‘python G:/user/hello_world.py’). But this needs to be run as a subprocess because I want to be able to kill it impromptu by having it watch another file, let’s call it ‘exit.txt’ and then return to watch status if that file exists. (this is necessary as some of the code in my field can easily scale runtime exponentially if not watched).
What a good way to start, keep on doing stuff. Just never stop.

Thata the thing, I dont KNOW that they will be 1,2,3,4. This simplified specific simulation has only those fitness variables, however in future simulations the Fitness will be much more chaotic.
Any time you’re doing float comparisons, you should account for precision. assert abs(0.1*34 -3.4) &lt;= 1e-12 Or something like that
Digital Ocean, Linode, Scaleway or AWS Lightsail. ~$5USD/month gets you a small Linux box with a bit of storage and a fat pipe. If you need Windows, then it gets a bunch more expensive
Nice work. Im 14.
I haven't used it much myself, but possibly [twilio](https://www.twilio.com/docs/sms/quickstart/python)?
Oh, I guess closeness to NZ/AU is also a factor. I'm assuming AWS will be the best pick for that then?

Making a webpage to watch election results in North Carolina trickle in live, minute by minute. The live-updating files on the NC state board of elections website aren't cross-origin resource-shareable or whatever; so, instead of having each instance of the page ask the state board for each file once a minute, I'll download the files myself once a minute, digest them into the minimal information needed for the map page to update, and git-push that summary, which the map page will be able to successfully request.

No, tkinter is always preinstalled. Just try import tkinter, and use the docs online.
Heck yes you did!!! Keep going.
But they are fundamentally 2 different things. Azure is a cloud platform, anaconda is a distro for python. So what do you want to learn, infrastructure or programming?
Smart move on sticking a .lower() on the end of your input() call. It’s a good way to start thinking down the line about sanitizing inputs, or at least giving yourself more uniform inputs to work with. Keep it up!

I see that you consider stating facts hateful. And nice of you to strawman the "as" arguments in.
That was my first game too! I would recommend learning how to use the turtle module because you can make stuff like snake with that.
Awesome I remember my first real project, it was a calculator made it when I was 12 good old days
I'm not *telling you what to do*, but leaving a warning for those who don't know better as to why it's considered a bad practice. This is the aspect your seem to be missing. This is a public forum. You said something that can lead to someone having a real bad day at the office, and all I'm doing is attempting to reduce the chance of that. No need to be an ass about it.

how different are they in terms of both infrastructure and programming?
so you are saying they are different, right? can share with your views of both
Ok I'll use it thanks
well done! KEEP GOING!!!!!
Seems like you can also try AWS EC2 (micro instances is free)
That seems way easier but also was more complicated for me to understand 😂 I'll try do different things
Ok I'll do that today
Because anyone who disagrees with him is obviously a nonperson. :facepalm:
That's a good point. I prefer to do everything on the CLI, forget that Pycharm etc have all these neat features.
We're not the Python community. We're a bunch of hateful and vile men, that are regularly hated upon by the friendly and inclusive Python people on twitter.
When writing tests there’s [unittest.TestCase.assertAlmostEqual](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestCase.assertAlmostEqual) specifically for this.

Quote from [realpython interview](https://realpython.com/interview-kenneth-reitz/) on Nov 14, 2018: &amp;#x200B; **Ricky:** *You are, of course, most famous for writing the extremely popular* *requests* *library and the new* *pipenv* *library.* [*Python.org*](https://www.python.org/) *now recommends the use of* *pipenv* *for dependency management. How has the community received* *pipenv**? Have you seen much resistance from the community with developers preferring to stick to* *venv* *or older methods of dependency management?* **Kenneth:** The community has received pipenv very well, and even companies like GitHub are using its standards for security vulnerability scanning. I haven’t seen much resistance from the community at all, aside from some hatred on reddit. It took me a while to realize that [/r/python](https://www.reddit.com/r/python) doesn’t represent the Python community as much as it represents redditors who use Python.
&gt;rows\_and\_colums But, what 'rows\_and\_colums' it means actually?
Yeah it just helped to keep it easier to type an input in as you can type it in all caps and it still works
I'm just quoting the gist of the tweets I can recall. For all I care, you can identify as Tractor Tom.
Implementing your own sort is usually not a good idea. Thats why it is so slow. Built-in sorting will be much faster. You can use key argument to get score value (as someone already suggested). Another solution is to build array with fitness values and sort them using `numpy.argsort` to get indices. Something along these lines: ``` fitness = [x.Fitness for x in alist] idx = np.argsort(fitness) sorted_alist = [alist[i] for i in idx] ``` (There might be better solution for reordering in `itertools`)
They don’t require us to use git, but I want to, as the alternative would be versioning by copying files around. And that is something I don’t want to do at all (though many do that, or using Dropbox)
Don’t even thinking about the big wow when first seeing a full blown IDE with code completion and such
? I don't understand. they are completely different. I suggest reading a bit about azure and a bit on anaconda, it will probably be more useful for you at this point
Thank you very much!
I've never thought of calling a function within itself for a restart, always use while loops. Taught me something today, thank you :)

I don't understand your question :D rows\_and\_columns in this context means nothing, it's a wrong named variable (in my opinion) which is only does one things what I've written above.

What's up with people putting their age on the threads lately? Unless you're like 5 or something, it's completely irrelevant... How long you've been learning though, that's relevant. This isn't a personal attack, I've just been seeing that a lot in the last month or so. Anyway, good job, keep up the good work.

What? &gt;&gt;&gt; text = input("&gt; ") &gt; 1234 &gt;&gt;&gt; type(text) &lt;class 'str'&gt;
Anaconda and Azure are 2 completely different things. If you are trying to learn Python, I would recommend you to install Anaconda on your local system and tinker around with it. Anaconda comes with most, if not all of the tools and libraries used by most Python programmers.
&gt; The alist is a one dimensional array of agent objects. Each object has a fitness score based on their performance in the simulation. `sorted(alist, key=lambda x: x.Fitness)` This will sort your agents by their `Fitness` property.
Also the line about the glitch will *never* occur, so you can remove it entirely.

So convenient for debug printing - which is most of my debugging. Without an argument, neatly prints the current location in the code - with an argument, prints _the expression_ and its value. Actually, I saw [this last year](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/7xjwm2/i_got_tired_of_printing_variables_so_i_built/) when it was submitted here, but it didn't seem ready for prime-time. Well, I ran into it again yesterday, and pretty well every bug and feature request in that thread seems to have been addressed. More, there seem to be versions of it in other languages like C++ which I will look into when I come back to that.
when i was 13-15 i tried to make my first game on BASIC. with mario sprites.. But my computer couldn't save created files. So 2-3 days i had wrote game, 1-2 days i played. after that it was necessary to turn off the computer and start everything from the beginning
What are your reasoning for not spending the time/effort to learn using a real debugger?
See "Editors and IDEs" in [python developers survey](https://www.jetbrains.com/research/python-developers-survey-2018/#development-tools) PyCharm is awesome. PyCharm Community Edition is enough to get started. It is free and has the necessary minimum of features. Built-in local terminal and interactive console(IDLE with some advantages over the standard ones), version control systems support. Syntax highlighting, syntax(Python) and spell checker, code formatting and context-sensitive code completion. Type Hints support and PEP8 tips. Atomatic matching of braces, parentheses and quotes, usages search and refactoring toos. There is also a mode for checking code compatibility with Python 2 and Python 3. I accidentally turned it on once. There are so many different tools in IDE. There is also a debugger. In PyCharm you can work with virtual environments. You can assign a specific Python interpreter to a specific project. PyCharm works on Windows, Mac OS or Linux. and so on. Another option: PyCharm Educational Edition. But I did not try it.
Newsflash - I learned to use a debugger the first time almost forty years ago! Bet you can't say that. :-P The answer is that a debugger is these days my _third_ line of defense. There were jobs where I lived in gdb every day, but much of what I'm doing these days involves real-time control, huge amounts of data, multiple servers, and often more than one. My first attack is to read the code. I spend a huge amount of time doing only that in general, and that usually finds the problem. Then I use print statements - because it is _more effective_. I can collect a bunch of data at one time on how the program is running and then analyze it at leisure. And I use a debugger if all else fails.
I can downvote you to oblivion for reacting like an ass to the question, though.
Well I had qbasic
The questions isn't so much which, but why.
Great job!
Excuse me, but your initial statement was this: "What are your reasoning for not spending the time/effort to learn using a real debugger?" Well, that's just rude. First, it assumes something that's absolutely untrue, that I haven't learned a debugger. Second, it assumes that I didn't do that because I didn't spend the time/effort - i.e. because I'm lazy. You could have expressed exactly the same idea in a polite and respectful manner - "Can you explain why you use print statements rather than a debugger" or even "Many people, including myself, think a debugger is much better than print statements, for [these reasons]". In response, I explained exactly where I was at with my strategy, and instead of addressing my solid arguments, I get a personal insult "ass" and a threat "downvote you to oblivion". If you're interested in a conversation about debugging, I'd love to have one!
You downvote questions you don't like. That's all I need to know about you.
I have not downvoted anything on this page. I try to avoid downvoting in general. I have not upvoted you though. In case you are unaware, Reddit fuzzes your upvote count reporting somewhat, so there is some variability even if no one has voted at all.
Am I the only one who start with python only to write my own exploits instead of being a scriptkiddie? Lmao
Sure, and you've neiother thrown a tantrum first, and then given a reasonable reply second.
You should perhaps chill out. Anyway, I have to go, hope your day improves.
For someone at your age, it's quite impressive. I'd recommend trying to make it into an actual application with a GUI using Kivy, Tkinter, Pygame, Arcade or whatever you choose. I would recommend Tkinter since it comes with a fresh install of Py3, which I see you're using. Good luck! :D
Started with a book called [Learning Python](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596158071.do)... had a job in 6 months. Had a career in a year. Been more than a decade now, still learning.
I'm chill. How about you answering a simple question in a san way? Your second reply was fine, but unfortunately you lost at first.
Tried to implement this using hints here. import random def rps(): weapons = ["r","p","s"] descriptions = { "r" : "rock", "p" : "paper", "s" : "scissors" } decisions = { "r" : {"r":"draw", "p":"loss", "s":"win"}, "p" : {"p":"draw", "s":"loss", "r":"win"}, "s" : {"s":"draw", "r":"loss", "p":"win"}, } messages = { "win" : "so you won! Congratulations.", "draw" : "so it is a draw.", "loss" : "so unfortunately you lost!" } print("Welcome to Rock Paper Scissors!") user = input("To play enter your choice:\nr (rock), p (paper), s (scissors): ")[0].lower() if user not in weapons: print("Your choice is not recognised, please try again.") rps() return else: print("You chose:", descriptions[user].upper()) i = random.randint(0,2) comp = weapons[i] result = decisions[user][comp] print("Computer chose,",descriptions[comp].upper(),messages[result]) rps()
So, more experimentation found an interesting... well, I can't truly say it's a defect, but certainly an unexpected feature. You can't call `ic()` from the interpreter, nor from a function that you have defined by hand from the interpreter. The reason is that it analyzes the source code (which seems a bit suss to me to be honest) and of course, if you're running from the interpreter, or defining a function from the interpreter, there is none. It does work if the `ic()` call is in a file that you have imported into the interpreter, so in practice I can't see it actually causing any issue. Otherwise, it's so far as advertised, but I will report back if not.

circa 2003, from a tutorial on the internet. I am still learning. If you mean how long it took to learn until I could use it for something that goes to production, I would say , as fast as I could read online examples or library documentation that helps me solve whatever I am solving. The only difference between now and the first months of using python is that after 15 years of using it, I am able to use a lot of libraries without need of documentation.

It is. Plivo is cheaper. But Twilio has cool help pages.
With regard to language itself, I have learned the most from [checkio.org](https://checkio.org) by solving problems, reading comments and solutions of other people. Presently, you can find a lot of servers with similar offering, yet checkio was mostly about Python and it has been showing. Furthermore, checkio enables its users to learn more libraries than those ones, found in standard distribution. If I am not mistaken, you can import numpy as well. This is not something common.
A bunch of blog posts mostly related to handling RSS 0.9, back in 2001/2002. Must have been 2.1 or 2.2. I’ve never had a job that would pay me to write python, sadly - it wasn’t valued in my local job markets until very recently (and even now it’s only in a few hotspots, like London and Cambridge). (Btw, personally, I find it impossible to answer “how long did it take to learn language X”, because it assumes one can learn some definition of *”all of it”*, which is vague and impractical (any popular language will have tons of frameworks and libraries, some knowledge of which will be essential in any given real-life scenario; and there are invariably gotchas and techniques that one will only learn in certain circumstances, like the old/new classes distinction that py2 had - if you weren’t impacted by something related to it, you did not have to care). One can understand looping and slicing in 20 minutes, but even just the stdlib will take years to master in its entirety. And then the language changes...)
Okay my bad. I though you were trying to find the length of an int. I ran your program and it says that “local variable total referenced before assignment”. So in that case, assign your local variable total inside the function. That would do.
to be fair Fark has some of the funniest discussions, even with the terrible comment system. i still lurk there for the laughs.
I'm not the OP :)
That’s kind of embarrassing from my part. Apologies, my friend.
Because it is a bad habit to get into. The fundamental problem with print debugging is that it assumes that you know what you are looking for. That you've isolated the source of the problem before you've even begun investigating it. Once you get beyond a couple of variables and short simple loops, that's a bad assumption to make. debugging via print statements or a helper function like this is fine for small, simple code. It is even okay as your first step in finding out what is really going on inside your code, but code gets complex fast. Do yourself a favor and get into the habit of using a debugger. A good debugger shows you all the variables, objects and parameters ***and*** highlights them when they change. In less than the time it takes to add "ic(klass.attr)" and rerun your code, you can (in any number of IDEs, many are free) add a breakpoint and run the code in debug mode. You get to see klass's attributes along with everything else as well (with the most recently changed variables highlighted), plus a stack trace.
Stuff happens :)
Use \`Popen\` when you don't need the data program returns.
I liked it for awhile then it quit working. PySnooper is on my list of things to try.
This bro, 6 years down this line and i really wish somebody would have told me this sooner
 math.pi = (math.tau := 6.283185307179586)/2
I wrote a 3D GUI using numpy, scipy, vtk, and PyQt. My computer is as quiet as can be. Another GUI my boss designed that I took over is based on mine, but updates it’s animation every 30 seconds. It’ll buttery smooth compared to my animations. My GUI doesn’t sound like a jet engine though and therefore uses a lot less power. I prefer programs that do as little as possible instead of trying to be fancy. It still looks damn good.
Can relate..
Another answer to your question is that icecream is one of thousands of object/variable inspectors in the cheese shop.
Bloat you can make this in less code
Use operator.itemgetter and first do the sorting on first field, snd then another statement with reversed sort on the second field
Which editor did you use to write in Python? One person I know, an experienced developer, worked on a project in which it was forbidden to use third-party software for development, in particular IDE. He had to use only built-in Python IDLE. And he said it was terribly uncomfortable. I agree that the IDE hides some things. For example, handling [the module search path](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#the-module-search-path). It is also more convenient to use IDLE for testing small pieces of code. The IDE for such tasks is a bit heavy. On the other hand, in the IDE it may be more convenient to work even on a small pet-project. So you don't use an IDE at all, or does this only apply to Python?
Not a course but the recently released free [Clean Architectures in Python](https://leanpub.com/clean-architectures-in-python) ebook is really quite good. I am half way through it. Follows a TDD, clean architecture style. Uses cookie-cutter to get you using a typical standard structure, etc.
Wouldn't that scramble the first field? Maybe sort the second field first, then, using a stable sorting algorithm, sort the first
This code is disgusting. Btw learn git
[https://github.com/khrynczenko/compimg](https://github.com/khrynczenko/compimg) Yesterday I released a new version of my package that exposes routines for obtaining numerical values that represent how similar is one image to another. Basically it implements some algorithms for comparing images in terms of similarity. Those are often used to evaluate performance of image restoration/reconstruction algorithms. With this version I solved some performance issues and I think its finally ready to be used by others. Its my first python project that I released publicly and I am trying to maintain it as best as I can with usage of CI tools, publishing builds on PyPI etc.
Month over Month and Quarter over Quarter Try one of the time series datasets instead. It's got monthly values going back a few years that might be more what you are looking for. DataWorld also has all of this (and a lot more data) in a more easily browsable format: [https://data.world/zillow-data/all-zillow-metrics-city](https://data.world/zillow-data/all-zillow-metrics-city)
Can you give more details on what made the differences ? Which part of the code did you/him change to make it smoother (or not) ? Thanks
At my first job where I had to build a web app. Friend showed Django and it happened 5 years ago. Still a lot of learning now.
First, great work. I'm really impressed with how good your flow is already. Next, try changing this to be in a loop instead of recursive. You'll probably quit before this ever happens but let's say you use this function later with a robot of some sort; in this case Python will die because of too many recursion calls. Last, you're only a few months away from seeing someone else's code and no matter how hard you try, you can't help but critique it! 😂 Sorry!
The subject of the article is differentiating sort and sorted, not the intricacies of scoring races. The author was trying to accomplish his mission, not yours.
Any good guides for getting into using GitHub? Also can I use it for multiple languages easily? I have Xcode projects that would be nice to backup on there but then also my Python projects. Would love some input
Nice work! If you want to expand it, there's this game called [Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock](http://samkass.com/theories/RPSSL.html). Other games that are fun for beginners to write: [Nim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nim), tic-tac-toe, guess the number (either the player thinks of a number and the computer guesses, or the computer thinks of a number and the player guesses)
Writing scripts for my desktop/OS while having one book as reference. Especially on Linux it is very easy to interact with the Operating System, so there is fast progress but also many things to learn.
I knew basic Python from university but I really *learned* it from Think Python by Allen Downey.
https://docs.python.org/3/howto/sorting.html#sort-stability-and-complex-sorts The second example under Complex Sorts is what you want: use two sorts with a key-function, first sort the reverse on second field first, then sort on the first field.
Ahhh QBasic... Took a bit of getting used to after GW-Basic :)
agreed. While I have only just started using PyCharm (for about a couple of months now), I still default to using Pyscripter when I just need to run some code quickly. =\]
Whoops, updates every 30 milliseconds...stupid autocorrect. I’m not a fan of the smoother animation. The entire code is built around doing a animation as a function of phase angle vs it being an afterthought. In this case, the underlying data is a complex eigenvector, so you just add the phase angle and calculate to magnitude to find the new vector. My GUI simply has a less optimized update loop. It updates the fringe, potentially using a different result type, it updates minor actors. It has more animation profile options. The GUI is designed around actions like result application and legend updating and responsiveness because it’s not doing anything most of the time. The smoother GUI has a hell of a time trying to decouple the fringe from the displacements and cannot manage a legend. This is due to the coupled nature of the data and methods, but also why it’s animation is nicer. To me, the animation is an afterthought. It’s not something I want running constantly. Therefore, making code complicated to animate smoothly is a mistake. Both codes will export an animation, but my GUI can also do time/frequency animations. The gifs are the same though assuming a fair problem.
I got it working with this: word_freq.sort(key=lambda tup:(-tup[0], tup[1]))
I used this: word_freq.sort(key=lambda tup:(-tup[0], tup[1])).
Shouldn’t it be `name=={name}`. It isn’t assignment after all. Regardless, I prefer output like `foo 12, bar 4.56, baz ‘hello’` but maybe I’ll adopt the shortcut.

How is this supposed to help?
While I'm in favor of real debuggers whenever possible, it's not always easy to get set up, particularly if you're trying to remote debug. Also, debuggers add significant overhead that can change the nature of the bug in some cases. Not saying that you should always reach for print debugging first, just that sometimes it can be better than an interactive debugger. Also, I've run into plenty of cases where it's way, way easier to throw in some print debugging to display the path of execution along with the runtime values so I can debug larger structures. Stepping throw a dozen breakpoints that are hit a hundred times in one execution is much harder to understand than a nicely formatted output that I can reread as needed. They are complimentary styles of debugging, not adversarial. You can use both, and both can be immensely useful at resolving your problem. Don't discredit one because it's somehow "not as good". I think print debugging (or at least logging) can be better for understanding what a large, complex section of code did overall, while interactive debuggers are best for really narrowing in on a problem and finding out where it's broken. There's a reason why we also encourage extensive logging. It's so you can do postmortem debugging.
Python is slow af, you don't write real programs with python because it's so bloated and slow. Compare a program written in python vs c. The C program will be alot faster. So it's just better to learn C now and become real good at it.
Its for attention.
&gt; Which editor did you use to write in Python? I develop on Linux or MacOS, so I use [vi/vim](https://www.vim.org/download.php). That's available for Windows, but if you can't install anything I have used notepad on Windows. IDLE is just too painful. &gt; So you don't use an IDE at all, or does this only apply to Python? I've never used an IDE for anything. Even when I was programming C heavily I just used vi/make and the Unix/Linux tools (grep, find, shell, etc). Of course, I've mostly developed on Unix/Linux where there is quite an extensive array of tools. Windows is a desert, so the first thing to do there is install a Unix/Linux environment.
I wrote a whole functioning community like that around when I was 16. PHP, HTML and CSS, and did all the graphics in a pirated version of Photoshop. Ended up teaching my web design teacher how to do most of those things (as well as the class). Then again I sucked ass in math and sciences, so... :)
you realize this advice is complete bs and never works
I added a issue in this repo with the solution i used in comment.
Cool! Im 13 too (just started learning python), and i look up to you. Hopefully i can make a game like that aswell someday...
I'm a jupyter LAB guy. As I do analytics and exploration here are what I use the most : - [templates](https://github.com/timkpaine/jupyterlab templates) - [jupyter-git](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab-git) - [jupyterlab-toc](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab-toc) And I'm really interesting to see what others use, thanks for this thread.

I have seen some good ideas in the other replies, always choose whatever will make the code more clear to you.
There are plenty applications for Python. I use it all the time for mockups and data manipulation. I think it's not a great first language, but hey the kid is programming and that's incredible.
Nice I started programming about a year ago and I'm still struggling with basic concepts Keep it up BTW nice and readable code but you probably could have been more efficient with objects
That is a good idea. Going to disagree with the others telling you to wait on JS. JavaScript will broaden your learning opportunities, and will allow you to write cool web applications. It will be a powerful pairing with your Python knowledge.
I want to accomplish this with the users bank accounts. Similarly to how Acorns does this. My assumption is that they’re using the Plaid API to gain access to the users accounts.
That's funny! When I was 13 I did something like that too!
So you're building your own service with that as the entire point? I doubt that's going to be viable, cause most of the money will go into processing fees.

There are probably some misunderstanding on the setup, how about: - A bash script with an infinite while loop which sleeps every few seconds. - In the loop: - Check for a file and execute it as a subprocess, log the pid using `$!` - Check for `exit.txt` if so kill the pid previously logged.
 bfvls = ([3,1,0,2], [4,5,2,3]) bfvls1 = tuple([sorted(j, reverse=True) if j==bfvls[0] else sorted(j) for j in bfvls]) #Or for more readability bfvls2 = [] for i in bfvls: if i == bfvls[0]: i.sort(reverse=True) bfvls2.append(i) else: i.sort() bfvls2.append(i) #Or simplier way i1 = sorted(bfvls[0], reverse=True) i2 = sorted(bfvls[1]) bfvls3 = i1,i2

It's next level coding to protect against a bit flip am i right?
See what you can read using ffmpeg. It might be able to pull the metadata you need.
Does it still work slow as hell? It was almost unusable on my machine.

Would like this to be banned tbh. (I'm 8yo)
Listen if you think python is good for atring an data manipulation you're a moron. Just use `bash` combined with `awk`. It's much easier to manipulate strings and data with and you don't need any bloated libraries like python need.
It really shouldn't count as a subscription when you purchase through Humble Bundle. On a side note for any students you can get [this package](https://education.github.com/pack) from GitHub which includes a bunch of stuff (you probably won't use) but includes a year of GitKraken Pro.
Thank you.
I'll give it a go tomorrow, thanks for the suggestion.
I'm not a moron. I went to school for this. SQL Server uses Python for a lot of automation and such. I guess everyone who doesn't use C is an idiot?
Thanks! I don't see why not: it doesn't use any private APIs and follows all App Store review guidelines.
Unpopular opinion. I really like using GitKraken. Specially after they released the Interactive Rebase feature in the latest version. Can someone tell me why are you not using it?
Good stuff. Keep up the good work.
Yes exactly, idiot. Btw. Who tf runs python as backend? That's the most retarded thing I have heard, don't you care about performance and taking advantage of your hardware? It's people like you take poisoned programs and programming. It's people like you who created bloated programs because you can't code for shit. It's people like you that makes websites or programs that eats up ram because of poor design.
what is the problem?
Very nice :)
I don't use GitKraken because I can use git from the terminal built into my IDE of choice. If I had a 3rd monitor I might consider it, but switching programs constantly is annoying.
Lists: ``` a, *b = [1, 2, 3, 4] ``` Dicts: ``` foo, bar = {'foo': '1', 'bar': '2'}.values() ```
It gives you how many seconds passed between your `date` and the "start of time" (many \*nixes implement 1/1/70 as the starting date, not 1 AD) where the last part calculates a fraction of the second (based on microseconds you've got in datetime object).
your website cannot be reached impossible to see the VS codes of the video what if to make visibility better?
Why are you re-implementing a basic sorting function? Python's built in sorting functions (`your_list.sort()` (sort your_list in place) and `sorted(your_list)` return a sorted copy of `your_list`) work very well using TimSort and handles nearly-sorted (and nearly-reverse sorted) cases very well, and is optimized for python's quirks. Also if your recursive code is failing because you are hitting python's recursion limit, you can increase it (e.g., `import sys` and `sys.setrecursionlimit(1500)`). However, recursion in python is generally expensive and it would be better to write in an iterative style. You can rewrite any [recursive function as a tail-call recursive function using continuation-passing style](https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2017/on-recursion-continuations-and-trampolines/). Then trivial to convert a tail-call recursive function to an iterative loop like: def tail_call_recursion(*args): args = do_internal_calcs(*args) if some_boolean_criteria(*args): return final_calc(*args) else: return tail_call_recursion(*args) Which can be rewritten as: def iterative(*args): while True: args = do_internal_calcs(*args) if some_boolean_criteria(*args): return final_calc(*args)
I heard at PyCon that the Python core team uses buildout. I need to check on that.
 Keep up the good work. Now that you've tested your current knowledge you should push yourself further to improve on your skills. You should look into OOP and things like classes. Your code can benefit from this by becoming a bit more readable by encapsulating things. Maybe like a inventory list that can hold your players in game items.
I mean you could do something like: pdftk `pdfgrep -l "my search" *.pdf` cat output search_results_concatenated.pdf
You need to look at yourself on the mirror. Not everything is a competition, specially on the internet. “You lost, I win” is childish.
If I write a string as an argument for an input () method (eg input('insert a number: ')), when I run the program, in the console the cursor appears before "insert", but as soon as I type something it goes at the end of the line. It's not a big deal, just annoying
Sublime Merge has become my preferred git GUI. It's a bit more barebones, but it's worked well for my needs. SourceTree is also very good in my opinion. I just can't bring myself to pay for a git GUI when there are good free options (yes Sublime is paid software, but like their text editors, you have an indefinite evaluation period)
In other words a 32-bit timestamp, right?
Luckily I have two monitors at work. But yeah, even PyCharm have a decent git client inbuilt and for more complicated git commands like rebasing on master or discarding some commits can be done from the command line. I need to rethink if the 50 USD per year is worth it or not. :/
For lists it works decently well, but for dicts this is really not the same thing. What if I don't know the ordering of the keys in that dict?

I have never tried Sublime Merge, but I will give it a try! Have you also tried VSCode? I want to give it a good try as I am a little fed up with the font rendering of PyCharm on external monitors and their theming support (very early) and I wanted to try coding in VSCode. Spending the whole day with the font rendering is a pain and I am slowly starting to feel fatigued because of that. Does VSCode have some support for merge?
Yeah I just thought Java is good for web / communication and good for games so I will learn it :)
Can you explain further?
I wonder if I ask them these how many would get the reference !
I run all git commands directly from the Git Bash terminal inside VS Code.
Haha I made one in scratch so that's where I learnt how to actually do it with code blocks then just had to learn python language :)
Yep I made lots of luck sort of games on scratch and now porting them over. My next challenges will probably be noughts and crosses, snake and maybe a car driving game
Great! Going to code snake next :) and maybe upgrade rock paper scissors with other people's recommendations
How i would've written this, just so you can compare your code: import random options = {'r': 1, 'rock': 1, 'p': 2, 'paper': 2, 's': 3, 'scissors': 3} words = {1: 'Rock', 2: 'Paper', 3: 'Scissors'} response = {1: 'you won! Congratulations!', 0: 'it\'s a draw!', -1: 'unfortunately you lost.'} def rps(): print('Welcome to Rock, Paper, Scissors!') while True: answer = input('To play: type in Rock (r), Paper (p) or Scissors (s): ').lower() if answer in options: answer = options[answer] print('You chose {}!'.format(words[answer])) break print('You didn\'t pick an option... Make sure you spell it right!') computer = random.randint(1,3) if computer == answer: resolution = 0 else: resolution = (answer - computer) / (-2)**(abs(answer - computer) &gt; 1) print('The computer chose {}, so {}'.format(words[computer], response[resolution])) rps()
Congrats! It’s an awesome feeling! Don’t stop now tho ;)
I put it in there when I was making the computer choose a random number because I couldn't get it working
I put my age on it because I thought people could judge that I didn't have a lot of experience because of my age. Isn't that obvious?
Haha

Also, I said its my first game.
I'm making a dice rolling program for an RPG that I play (called Shadowrun). Next to 'Hello World' and a few math equations this is my first program in Python and apparently I'm terrible at remembering to put a : in my code. It's quite humbling to start at ground zero in a new skill. I look at my degrees (Culinary), military accomplishments, even my family and feel content with life. Then I work through another Python lesson and feel like that lazy teenager from decades ago because omfg why won't this IF statement just do what I want.
Nope, 64 bit float representing seconds.
Thanks so much

I've used VS code a bit, but it hasn't become my go to. I'm on the data science side, and I mostly use Jupyter when I'm working in python. In my experience, VS code has been pretty good. The interface is very usable and straight forward. It's easy to set up and get going with. It's definitely not as powerful as full Visual Studio, but you don't need that 99% of the time, and Visual Studio can be very cumbersome. VS code has a bunch of plugins for git, but I haven't gotten around to using them. I just prefer to use a separate program. I'd recommend trying out VS code and seeing if you like it.
I'm doing that and snake now!
No, I'm waiting until I've learnt most of python to start js. By soon I mean like a year 😅 not ready for semicolons yet
I don't really understand what they are really saying. Using the if statements helped me grasp it
Can't really think of something to automate my life really. I just enjoy making games :)
Ok thanks
Agree. I’ve have the same issue. Hopefully someone has a helpful answer!
Having too much experience with managing codebases where "We just need this extra printout to debug"^TM have been the norm, I'd recommend that you get into the habit of running even hello world type of programs in a debugger, rather than spending time on becoming an [expert beginner](https://daedtech.com/how-developers-stop-learning-rise-of-the-expert-beginner/).
Mind if I ask why you have a wpa network program with 77 commits on your github?
You'd use ffprobe: ffprobe -i yourfile.wav -v quiet -print_format json -show_format -show_streams Check the output of this if it contains your desired data. I once wrote a function to parse output from `ffprobe` into a python dict: import subprocess import json def get_media_info(media_file): media_info = {} ffprobe = subprocess.Popen( [ 'ffprobe', '-i', media_file, '-v', 'quiet', '-print_format', 'json', '-show_format', '-show_streams', ], stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE, shell=False) stdout, stderr = ffprobe.communicate() if ffprobe.returncode == 0: raw_json = stdout.decode('utf-8') media_info = json.loads(raw_json) return media_info
I thought it could be interesting since I don't have a lot of experience to make a sort of thread for people to give me advice. That was my basic logic.
Oof. Someone's day isn't going very well.
Many people had said this; I put that in there because I couldn't get the random integer function working.
Using `lambda`, this works similar to the JS example, though with more complicated syntax: In: a, b, kwargs = (lambda a, b, **kwargs: (a, b, kwargs))(**{'a': 10, 'b': 20, 'c': 30, 'd': 40}) In: a Out: 10 In: b Out: 20 In: kwargs Out: {'c': 30, 'd': 40}
Thanks

You'll grow a lot as a programmer soon. Have fun on your journey.
I'd say he really needs to discover it for himself. If he used scratch in the past he knows the basic logic. Then you can get him into YouTubers like Code bullet and Michael Reeves to get him interested and then he can learn on codeadamy
GitHub Education is fantastic. You get free JetBrains pro licences and $50 of DigitalOcean credit, to name a couple other things.
It’s the way they list the subscription when checking out. It’s really easy to not notice that they’re adding it to your order.
I find that print debugging allows me to more quickly map out the problem that I'm debugging. I can print specific context at key points and get an easily digestible listing of the most relevant info. Of course, this only works when you have some idea of what the problem might be. For deeper bugs I would jump into the debugger.

This will come in handy for people with student loans! Interest is compounded daily which is a rip off! Fortunate I paid mine off quickly ✌🏻
Posting the actual text, rather than an unreadable dark on black screenshot might help you a bit. Popsting in an appropriate subreddit might help you even more.
I am lucky enough that I had never the need for debugging. Not that my code is perfect, but I feel I have always been in a high-level enough layer not to need to. So, I'm curious, would you folks share scenarios where you do need to debug and why there is no other way you reckon to investigate? Poor api? Poor code? Just too low level stuff?
What is a context manager and why would you use it.

&gt; How did you feel about Android releases being named for a candy? Indifferent. A code name is usually a fun thing with a semantic version to back it. If the product was called Popsickle I'd probably buy an iPhone.
ha python thats gay. rip i have to learn python too until a levels when they let us pick a language which isnt the easiest and most basic language i can think of.
Haha I’m already trying to figure out what to build next. When it actually deployed I definitely had myself a mini-celebration. Amazing feeling...even though I know no one will use it lol.

Mirrors etc are also counted so one download counts as multiple. I also use Travis but clone the repo and do a `pip install .` so not sure if it counts towards PyPI downloads.
* Describe your problem; we're not able to guess what you expect to happen. * Don't post a screen shot/photo; post something that can be copied into an editor or REPL. * Ask "Why doesn't this code work"-questions in /r/learnpython

A configuration file but you should keep the arguments in case you need to override something in the config - like if an argument don't exist, lookup the config. Also you can group arguments if you don't need them all at once. Argparse support this.

Because Magit exists.
Oh, well thank you very much for such a direct response! I may grab it up just to have that information about the fundamentals. What you mention about the broadness of the field is why I'm eager to have a book to turn to, to have some structure to the information. But I can understand why trying to cover the topic these days would be an unapproachable task. I appreciate the input!

I can recommend the version control in VSCode, it is pretty simple, but if you install the extension GitLense, it gets very usable - and I really enjoy the interface for merge conflicts and for getting a quick view of file changes.

I got the Jetbrains pro licenses before discovering this package [directly from their website](https://www.jetbrains.com/student/). I'm not sure if the other options in the package are available on their own. I didn't include it in my short evaluation because I already had it. Definitely a great package nonetheless but I haven't used anything besides these two in my first year of college so far. Jetbrains are my favourite IDE's by far!

I'm subscribed to that guy, actually, I learned about VADER Sentiment Analysis from him. If anything, I can at least shorten my code by using NLTK.
Can you tell something about the skill and how did you build it?
&gt; Magit I don't use emacs but looks good. I used to use vim a lot when I used to use linux as my main dev box. Those times there used to be plugins like tpope that helped me navigate revision control with a fair bit of finesse. Is there something similar to magit for vim now?
&gt;Edit: Yes, it has nice visual built-in support for merging versions. I will try this plugin out with VSCode. Thank you. I hope it supports interactive rebase too.
I wish I could have used the DO credit I got from my pack. They changed the terms and expired my credit before I could finish using it with only a month's notice...
I have something similar from my online bank Bunq, although there is a limit of 5 virtual cards at a time. I wanted to try privacy for a long time and I believe now is a good time ;)
Oh really? Did they change the expiry or something?

No complaints here. I use it mainly for scenarios like this where they want to save my info for a subscription. They also let you create cards that have a set limit on them (like $10/month), but I don't use that currently. But it would be good for things like iTunes to prevent spending too much.

Well what does that course cover? Pythonprogrammer on yt has Videos on AI with Python and a learning-resource collection. Sentdex also has some Videos on the topic I believe
A few years ago, yes. Credits had no expiry (and GitHub Education gave $100, not $50). I had been using my credit for a bit on and off. Then, they changed their terms to expire all credit after 12 months, didn't notify everyone, then finally sent an email a month before all of my credit was to newly expire saying "hey, the new terms start in a month so all this credit is going away, sorry for not telling you".
I automated a Friends gym heating and coling system and also did a web control for every element, also mail notificaciones if any temperature looks odd.

Automated mouse movements so that my IM does not show inactive if I am distracted during work. Also automated a few emails to be sent based on the date and counters when specific values for date and counters are achieved.
And do you have the mathematical knowledge to do NN? Some more advanced Python topics you could look into (Not for AI specifically, but in general): concurrency(threading, multiprocessing), asyncronous programming, iterators, generators, decorators, metaprogramming and I personally really enjoyed looking into bytecode and the Interpreter Extending python with a compiled language like Rust or C is also a great skill to have And since you should have a pretty good grasp of the language at this Point: please take a look at PEP8 If you haven't done so yet (there's also a great Google style guide - at least as far as docstrings are concerned) If you feel like you want to do AI I'd recommend the resources video by pythonprogrammer, he links to Lots of free resources on the topic

It would be nice if they could send a notification a week prior to extending the subscription. Or don’t automatically prolong a subscription without explicit user consent. I know that businesses count on people not caring enough about revoking their subscription if they got careless about it, that’s how they _also_ make their money. If I buy a subscription for one year, who’s to say that I want to have it the year after?
Why is this relevant here?
Neural Networks. And ANN = Artificial Neural Network. Read a bit on them and you'll soon encounter maths. I haven't studied them yet but I think that you'll need linear algebra, statistics, analysis to some degree and various numerical methods to really understand them. You probably can mock something up that works using keras etc., but I'm a big proponent of actually understanding what you do.

- what are the first steps you take before actually writing code for a new large python project? this aims to find out if they know how to properly set up a project - of course you have to know that too what im thinking of right now (assuming usage of git): - set up virtualenv - set up git repo with at least 2 branches, master and deploy - set up directory structure, with `.gitignore`, `requirements.txt` and `docs/` folder - set up documentation tools like sphinx (if they are supposed to be used) this is of course just a small example that i thought of
&gt; Can someone tell me why are you not using it? Because they support projects that use Python, like Mercurial? :-)

Nice question indeed !
"ordered" is not the same as "sorted". OrderedDict's only retain the insertion order of the items inserted into them: &gt;&gt;&gt; from collections import OrderedDict &gt;&gt;&gt; od = OrderedDict() &gt;&gt;&gt; od['z'] = 0 &gt;&gt;&gt; od['a'] = 0 &gt;&gt;&gt; od OrderedDict([('z', 0), ('a', 0)]) &gt;&gt;&gt; print(list(od.items())) [('z', 0), ('a', 0)]

Since no one else has posted this, this is something I bookmarked in my early days many years ago that might answer your question: [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2573135/python-progression-path-from-apprentice-to-guru](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2573135/python-progression-path-from-apprentice-to-guru) Given that its 2019 and that was written back in 2010, great Python developers should also be proficient with async/await code, type hinting, asyncio, and packaging-related stuff. Masters should be able to explain how the event loops work, how and why they can be customized, and bore you to death with facts about the GIL.

Well fortunately you're not required to use semicolons in Javascript. :)
This sort of question should be asked on /r/learnpython. It isn't an issue with python, it's an issue with the specific terminal application being used to run your program. If you try on a different console application, it's likely it'll look just fine
Indeed, I miss: 1. lists, for avoiding to have multiple `var1, var2, ..., varn` variables. 2. `for` loops for operating over the lists and not repeating so much code with different var names. 3. Function definitions `def` for the blocks that are repeating and not into a loop.

* Ah, `px.area` is only for stacked areas. For unstacked areas, you can just add a fill to the output of `px.line()` :) * Animations for `px.area` might be a bit janky, yeah. * The easiest way to embed the output of PX is to create a free Chart Studio Cloud account: https://plot.ly/Auth/login/?action=signup#/ and have us host it for you, but you can also output the plot to HTML and host that file yourself.

I liked the `!d` proposal. The `=` proposal is OK too but seems to have a lot more flexibility. I'm really not sure what the total set of possible things after `=` can be. It's a bit scary.

indeed, we cant see your indentation, but this error is tipically due to indenting via mixing spaces and tab. you could -type your code (no copypasting it) in an editor that indents automatically (I use Atom) -erase all indents and tab them again

Yep, completely free. You might have to prove you're a student though.

Sorry but no, it's not obvious... You can have more experience at 14 than a guy at 60, you could have started learning at 10 and the other guy started 3 months ago, hence why I said how long you've been learning is more important.

As the bot has told you before, these kinds of questions are better suited for r/learnpython. Though you'll need to describe your problem, and provide the code you're using (And [properly format it](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/faq#wiki_how_do_i_format_code.3F)). As is I don't know what libraries you're working on, and don't know what you mean by onscreenclick (After googling I think it might be related to the turtle packages?). Providing formatted code will be the biggest help when posting on /r/learnpython
When I tried it, it was no better than the git integration in my IDE (pycharm), and sometimes worse. I'm glad to hear they did a release focusing on interactive rebase. I think that was one of the big missing features.
I think what I and other Redditors are reacting to in this and other threads on the various packages that are being offered as alternatives to print debugging is just what you are saying, don't reach for print debugging first. One of Python's downsides and especially r/Python is the emphasis on the flavor of the minute packages. Debugging is one place where that can bite you in the rear in the long run. There are not just a lot of new Python coders here, but a lot of new coders in general. I think I and other Redditors like you are trying to share a few years of experience with Python and other languages. I hate to see new engineers make the same mistakes I did.
Hey, I'm using atom now and trying to run my program and it just print the first thing and doesn't continue. What do I do
There's another r/Python thread on PySnooper. It's great for some uses, not so appropriate for others.
Variable inspection is necessary with even the best-designed code when you are ingesting data from outside. slurping in JSON from a data source, reading in a CSV file, etc. Seeing what your objects and variables are doing with that data at various points in its execution is a must
I think it's because setup.cfg is tailored to setuptools. the idea of pyproject is that you can specify any packaging tool, not only setuptools.
This has nothing to do with Python.
Sorry, never used atom. If you copied the code from here, maybe there is an issue with the spaces in front of each line? Check the indentation of the copied code.
&gt; What if I don't know the ordering of the keys in that dict? Would [OrderedDicts](https://docs.python.org/2/library/collections.html#ordereddict-objects) help? &gt;Ordered dictionaries are just like regular dictionaries but they remember the order that items were inserted. When iterating over an ordered dictionary, the items are returned in the order their keys were first added.
Thank you for your service.

We run defect identification queries that are saved to csv files. As part of my daily reporting I had to manually review the current days results vs the previous day for 100+ defects, so I built a python script that does all the comparisons (comparing one row at a time against the previous days file) and prints them out to a consolidated csv file that works as a cumulative report. It originally took about 2 hours to do the reporting manually and now it takes maybe 20 minutes to do all the reporting - the script runs under a minute though. I did all the automation outside of work over a few months as I learned python and used it quietly for awhile before I brought it to the table one day. My manager liked the ingenuity and it got me a promotion from app support to a developer!
&gt; The main reason is that SQL, in line with its original goals, strives to be an English-like language, catered to “non-professionals”. However, with the growth of the language, this verbosity has contributed negatively to the ability to write and comprehend SQL queries. We learnt this lesson with COBOL, and the world has long since moved on to newer, more succinct programming languages. Funny to see this pop up on /r/python, of all places...
thank you so much man
r/learnpython is a great resource you can use
Thankyou
I'm ignorant of Python's history. Just because it was easy to read and write, does that mean it was geared towards non professionals? Was SQL really geared towards non professionals?
do you have tips on how to make a project meaningful? I wanted to make a project I could put on my resume. I decided to work on a census income dataset and use pandas and matplot lib to make graphs that would compare incomes between races, gender,county and state. I also wanted to use pandas and matplot lib to visualize which country or county has the most child poverty, and unemployed people. and to figure which job industry is the most popular by state (professional, construction , and office). you have any ideas on how to go further on this?
Please read our sidebar for hints on properly formatting your post to correctly render code. You'll also find a link to r/learnpython -- that's where you want to ask these type of questions. Also, please use a more descriptive title.
Please check with /r/learnpython. Also think about scope of variables, and how to call functions (`"example".islower` is a function while `"example".islower()`is a function *call*).

Your notebook is too long and it is not clear where the problem is by reading it. Trim it to show just an example of the problematic array and how you parse it in order to get the error. See [MWE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimal_working_example), [SSCCE](https://sscce.org).
**Minimal working example** In computing, a minimal working example (abbreviated MWE) is a collection of source code and other data files which allow a bug or problem to be demonstrated and reproduced. The important feature of a minimal working example is that it is as small and as simple as possible, such that it is just sufficient to demonstrate the problem, but without any additional complexity or dependencies which will make resolution harder. A minimal working example may also be referred to as minimal reproducible example or short self-contained correct example. *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Python/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28

I started off writing video games. Unlike other projects you're not forced to conform to any specs. If you want a feature, add it. If you hate graphics, don't use them. It takes place entirely in a bubble, which makes it a lot of fun. Just don't expect anyone to play anything you write. The day I published my game 40 other people published on the same platform, and no one played their games either.

I'm missing something here. This appears to be saying that a change can be made to the CPython source to enable configurable printing of stuff line numbers and filenames when using the "=" feature of f-strings. So how do I use it? Change the source for my Python implementation and recompile it? Second, something was merged with 3.8 beta 1. What was it?

May be worth waiting until your last year or last two years of uni to actually get the student bundle from Github, because most of the stuff in the bundle lasts for only a year (or 2 years, in the case of things like Cart and Datadog pro account and premium features). You probably won't use most of the things in the bundle much, but you'll probably probably not use them much even more (that is to say, even less) in your first years of uni/college.

That's...what a subscription *is*. They renew. It's not a surprise and it's not new, every company that sells subscriptions to software/magazines/internet service/etc. does this. Your user consent is your agreement to their T&amp;C followed by not canceling renewal. It's not about people being careless, it's about upholding your end of an agreement. It's not the other party's responsibility to ask you if you want to back out of an agreement; as long as they're still providing the service, they're upholding their end of the agreement.
You've got a few things going on here. I think the approach might be to take a step back and think about the how hangman is played. Imagine you are teaching someone for the first time. "I'll start the game by choosing a word that you need to guess. I'll represent the word by making an underscore mark for each character in the word. The point of the game is for you to guess the characters of the word. Each round of the game i'll show you the underscores (and successfully revealed characters... more on that later), you'll choose a character. I'll check if the character is in the word. If the character is in word i'll reveal those characters within the word. If the character isn't in the word i'll mark that as a failed attempt. At the end of each round i'll check to see if either you or I have won the game. I will win if you have made 6 failed attempts without revealing all the characters of the word. You will win if you reveal all the characters in the word in less than 6 failed attempts. We'll keep playing rounds until there is a winner. " With that in mind, you might want to start thinking about the parts you need: * Initial set up of the game * Clearing the screen from last time (perhaps) * Choosing a word to play with * Playing a round * Display the underscores/revealed letters * Asking for a choice from the player * Checking the choice against the word * Adding the choice to failed attempts * Checking to see either player has won * Ending the game * Display who won, what the secret word was You might want to set up a bunch of stuff initially: ```python # get a word to play with # you have some code here but you might want to put this in a function # def pick_random_word() solved = False # keep playing while not solved player_attempts = [] # keep track of all attempts so we can update the revealed characters failed_attempts = [] # keep track of the attempts because the player only gets 6 ``` The middle part is typically the key part. It is typically though of as the 'game loop'. ```python while not solved: # Display the underscores / revealed letters # you may want to have a function that does the heavy lifting # I would suggest you pass in the players guesses # def display_hangman_word(secret_word, player_attempts) # Asking for a choice from the player # Checking the choice against the word # if the choice is correct, congratulate the player, display the underscores / revelaed letters # if the choice is not correct add the choice to failed attempts; display that it was a bad choice # Checking to see either player has won ``` You've also got a few different logical errors in your code that may bump up against. "Yacht" does not equal "yacht". Or to be clearer, the case of the letters will matter. A player choosing lower case 'y' as their guess will not match the upper case 'Y' that you are expecting to be a match. A relatively standard approach is to transform everything to lower case. You can use the `str.lower()` function. Your method of choosing a word works but there is a simpler built in way to do this with `random.choice(the_list_you_want_to_choose_from)`. One of the more challenging areas might be displaying the underscores / revealed letters. You can do this a number of ways. Here's one: ```python def display_hangman_word(secret_word, player_attempts): ''' We want to loop over the secret word. if the secret word character has been attempted by the player then display that letter. if it hasn't then display an underscore. This will just return as a string e.g. " _ b _ d _ "''' to_display = [] # we'll build what we want to return from an empty list for letter in secret_word: if letter in player_attempts: to_display.append(letter) else: to_display.append('_') return ' '.join(to_display) ``` And you might call that code... ```python print(display_hangman_word('abcde', ['b', 'd'])) # This will print out "_ b _ d _" ``` If you really, really get stuck there Al Sweigart covers off Hangman in his rather good book [Invent Your Own Computer Games with Python](http://inventwithpython.com/invent4thed/chapter7.html).

I do commit, push, pull and checkout branch from the IDE or editor because that's more convenient that way but if I had to switch to a graphical tool for that, I'd keep using the command line. Anything else regarding git, I still do through the command line.
Make it clear what problem you are solving or what question you are answering. That will stand out much more than "look at this cool thing I created". If you really want it to be portfolio worthy, correlate the data. Then you can answer questions like, have increases income in woman and minorities been correlated? Is there a pattern to lags in increases between genders, races, that kind of thing. Post back what you come up with for feedback if you like.
What's the hate for print statement debugging? I use it in, maybe, 80% of the times I have problems and it's almost always sufficient. If not I happily move to the debugger.

It's like eating just one nacho, while dieting. Adding one is OK. Two also. Heck the third an fourth isn't going to damage you either. Suddenly half your code is print calls, you have to redirect its output and use grep to actually get what you want. And then .... it ends up in production. I have to support shit like that, and it's not pleasant in any way. So just don't do it. Use logging if you need a permanent record of what happened. Use a debugger to step through things. But never use print, unless it serves a purpose higher than figuring out what went wrong.

I had the fortunate situation to automate most of my bachelor thesis' processing. While the company I was writing it at loved my productivity, I ended up with just too much to write about and had a really challenging time trimming.

Also I don't even feel like it saves that much typing the way it's described in the article, perhaps if you are printing out more than a couple variables.

To be honest, Django teaches you a lot more than Flask does. So if you want to get something up and running quickly, Flask, if you want to learn and scale, Django.
I'll go the opposite direction of u/ILoveBigBlue, and suggest that flask is probably a better approach. Django teaches you a lot more *Django*, but not necessarily more python. Sure, Django will force you to use a large amount of object oriented design, but that's a little old-hat. Plus, Django's interface to SQL is basically for people who don't know sql (it's not very efficient). Flask is a better place to start, it's minimal and sufficient for your use cases. If you want "to learn and scale", then Django is actually *not* your best bet - **it's not asynchronous**! This means that in order to scale a Django app, you'll need to load balance across multiple instances and perhaps multiple servers - you'll be learning IT, not Python. And for anyone suggesting that tornado doesn't scale - take a look at dask! dask uses Tornado to asynchronously manage calculations running on massive clusters (the epitome of scale). TL;DR - Django is a world of it's own with a high learning curve that's getting older and less relevant. Flask is a gateway to Tornado, which is more current (in design) and being actively used by massive, growing projects (like PyData)
I've tried Kraken, source tree and sublime and so far the only client that has made me love it is sublime. It's just running git commands and tells you what commands it ran and the UI is incredibly clean and the app is blazing fast at everything. My two complaints are that it's not exhaustive in the options that git provides (no interactive rebase or pull rebase preserve merge commits yet) and the fact that it's closed source and like sublime it's probably going to be updated slowly
I've asked it there after I was asked to do so. I didn't know that channel until it was mentioned in the comments
I’ll throw my hat in with this. After having used both in projects, I now always default to Flask. Django might get me out the gate quicker, but as soon as I needed to do something that Django wasn’t built to do, I stalled trying to work around the opinionated approach of the framework. (To be fair to Django this might be more about me than the framework, I had the same issue with Ruby on Rails and CakePHP before I discovered the true path of Python). Flask makes it easier for me to do what I need to do.
If you're finding that stuff in production code then python features are not the problem. The problem is your inadequate processes for code review, testing, and submission, not to mention poor canarying. "Don't use it at all" doesn't fix your broken processes.

If you have to use more than 3 to find your issue (which is the case in more complicated code bases), then it's far more efficient to use a debugger where you can execute line by line and edit variables on the fly.

I was mainly hinting at the "make it look and feel similar to English, that ought to make it easier to learn" idea, which is common to these three languages. And being beginner-friendly and particularly welcoming to non-programmers was indeed a design goal for all three - with COBOL, the idea was that businesspeople could write their own code, with SQL it was data analysts and, again, businesspeople, for Python it was system administrators and power users (and, a bit later, students of programming). And even today, people who write SQL and Python alike often don't have "programming" in their job descriptions - with SQL, it's often "data analyst" or "DBA", and Python is used a lot in data science and scientific computing, where users only master enough Python to get the numbers they want.
Thanks!!
That makes sense and is what I figured you may have meant but wanted to be sure. Thank you for the explanation.
This is for Windows users but you could replace the Window class with native windowing for another OS. Written and tested on Python 3.7. A little proof of concept for a minimal pseudo-Electron for web-based GUIs. I got annoyed with the current Web View + Python offerings. I don't want HTTP shenanigans. I don't want opinionated abstractions that use 10% of the underlying technology. I don't want large, bloated code bases. Enough! The problem that needs to be solved isn't *that* complicated. Complaining solves nothing though so I sat down and tried to see if I could pull off a quick MVP. Turns out it's surprisingly easy! **Features** * Native Win32 Window Creation and Customization * Fully configurable CEF (application and browser settings + command line switches) * Remote Debugging in Browser (Automatically opens if enabled) * Automatically creates JavaScript bindings to a provided Python class. No HTTP Servers or JSON involved. * Automatically spins up a thread for message processing and Python =&gt; JS communication when the CEF browser is ready. * Only 235 lines of readable code. 3 classes: Browser, API, Window. My conclusion is that [CEF Python](https://github.com/cztomczak/cefpython) is criminally underrated. CEF is a beast and the Python bindings are a massive undertaking. Give it a star and try it out, it's a fantastic project.

Woah. What rendering engine did you use?
None! It was made from scratch in Python using Pillow (which is for drawing 2D shapes)

This looks awesome! I don’t have a chance to look over the source rn, but do you use Pillow to create 2D representations of a mathematically defined 3D object?
I wish I could do cool stuff like this. All I can do in python is make websites :(

I see. Thanks. Of course, it would still be nice to have an easy way to do that filename/line number thing without recompiling. Is it possible to write it as a library? That is, can I write a function that can tell from what file and on what line it was called?

Cool also I need your help if you can help me please reply and if you can't then no problem just ignore this 😁

I am not sure it's possible as a library or without recompilation since the transformation is done in C code. There are several packages that improve debugging experience. icecream might help here but it's more like a lightweight logger and needs an extra import : https://github.com/gruns/icecream

Definitely going to agree with this. Django has more baked in, but you won't learn as much, or as quickly, or ultimately be as flexible. This app isn't terribly complex—using Django would feel a bit to me like driving a tank to work. Powerful, sure, but more than necessary and more likely to slow you down. I'm not using Flask so much these days but it was always my go-to including on huge projects. Its flexibility does mean it's up to you to organize everything well so that it is maintainable as it grows, and there are a variety of best practices you should follow (tip: don't read any tutorials on Flask, SQLAlchemy, etc. older than a few years). But I definitely think it's the way to go, and again I have not personally needed to use Django even on Flask-based projects that became massive projects. One minor critique here though... \&gt; Flask is a gateway to Tornado, which is more current Flask is a gateway to *async* frameworks. Tornado is *not* modern, current, performant, recommended, or enjoyable to use. The future is definitely async (this is why I'm not using Flask so much... everything I've done for the last 2-3 years has been with [aiohttp](https://aiohttp.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html), [sanic](https://sanic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), and now [Starlette](https://www.starlette.io/)) and applying it to the right use-case can be a game-changer. But I wouldn't recommend this yet if you haven't worked with async much before, so probably not a good idea here. But when the time does come, keep these newer frameworks in mind... you'll hear a lot about Tornado and Twisted for legacy reasons but steer clear.
It would be amazing if you did a YouTube tutorial or something of the sort!
He does. Mentioned in another comment.
I think shields.io doesn't count mirrors or so. They don't have total downloads unfortunately but weekly, daily and monthly count rather.
Looks great, however there are a few things that could improve this code a heap. Let's start with how you distribute it. In industry and in general really most people use version control for saving and giving code to other people. The most famous of which is git. Github, the main platform of which is like Google drive except just for code. It's 100% quicker for code and it makes looking at your code really nice. I'd reccomend learning git and putting this project on GitHub. Secondly from looking at the attached image you seem to have just coded the whole game in the main scope i.e. you don't seem to have any functions or wrapping classes. It's considered best practice to make either functional or object oriented code. This simply assists readabllity and makes the code really easy to write. I'd recommend learning what a function is then what a class is and remaking the game with them Also if you want other ideas for simmilar projects look at making simple 2d games in pygame. Despite not being a games programmar or having any interest in videogames what so ever I learned alot making simple pygame games so I'd definately recommend them. All the best
There are functions!
It's just a script? What sort of stuff is it doing, and what else does it need access to that requires a whole server? If the answer is "not much", I'd save yourself the trouble and deploy it to Heroku in 5min. Or AWS Lambda, or something else in that caliber. If you need lots of disk space and other programs, then this won't work. But for most apps that are being deployed, even a small VPS is usually over-complicated and unnecessary. If you do need a full machine... then yeah, give EC2 a shot. (You probably don't want Lightsail.)
for vs code: gitlens and git history are my go-to git plugins there.
I only looked at the image you provided as I don't want to go through the process of opening downloading and then finding something to look at the code in. GitHub would make it much easier to actually look at the code. However this is beside the point. A general structure for a game I'd make would have a main class like class game which would contain very general methods such as run or get input, then you'd program different methods within the class with the story. By the fact you have a massive pile of global variables at the top of your program it indicates you haven't done this. While this works pretty well and you don't have to fix it really it would be much more expandable in an object oriented form Even using things like a state machine might be worth looking into
Okay thanks a ton for the advice! You were very helpful

I solved that without the code in my head. The link you rendered verified my assumption.
Thanks! As someone else said, it usually renders in a couple seconds a mesh with a few thousand polygons, but it depends on how powerful your CPU is.
Thank you!
Thanks! I'm still far from using advanced shading techniques but that tutorial will sure come in handy
Maybe I will, in the future, but now, I need a tutorial myself :)
Whether you think you can or you can’t, you’re probably right
I use the git support of PyCharm for some things: history viewing, commits, pushes, pulls, and simple rebases and merges, because it is just more convenient than opening a terminal for that. Also, it helps to review the changes in the commit window, with syntax highlighting and the ability to choose which files to commit or to edit files in-place before committing. For more complex tasks or when I get stuck, I revert to using the command line.
Yes. The mesh is made up of vertices and faces, the program does all the calculations (points on screen, face normals, vertex normals, face centers etc) and then uses the draw.polygon() function of Pillow to draw the faces.
Thanks for the advice! I will look into that
Thanks! What do you need help with?

&gt; A good debugger shows you all the variables, objects and parameters and highlights them when they change. I've been using debuggers for decades. The first ten years I was using debuggers, I used them to the exclusion of all other debugging tools. I talked quite a few famous programmers who used print debugging extensively and I thought, "Old fools." Glad I didn't open my mouth. &gt; In less than the time it takes to add "ic(klass.attr)" and rerun your code, you can (in any number of IDEs, many are free) add a breakpoint and run the code in debug mode. I can literally add a print statement and rerun within five seconds and it will show me exactly the variables I want, nothing else. More, it's not restarting the debugger - it's stepping through it and looking at the variables which must be done one step at a time. Printing allows me to collect a large amount of _relevant_ information over the run of the program and then run my eye over it to see the issue. Most of my systems - most of everyone's systems! - these days are not one monolithic program, either. Typically there are multiple threads, multiple processes, even multiple machines. Yes, I've successfully used debuggers on such systems - it's decidedly non-trivial. I do not use print debugging because I am not an expert user of debuggers - I use print debugging because it's extremely effective mechanism that allows me, personally, to find bugs extremely fast. As I wrote elsewhere here, the debugging is my third line of defense. The first thing I always do is to re-read the code - generally that finds the bug almost immediately. The second thing is print statements, because I can use them on remote systems, real-time systems, separate threads and processes, and because I can collect a great volume of information in an instant which I can then cast my eye over. A debugger is the third thing. &gt; You get to see klass's attributes along with everything else as well (with the most recently changed variables highlighted), plus a stack trace. But most of the time, that's not a positive. My debugger shows me many dozens of pieces of information at all time, _almost all of which are completely irrelevant to my problem._ More, it's really good at showing me the state of my program now, but not really good at showing me the history of the state of my program.

oh you're right. UTF-8 is default in Python 3 that's a leftover snippet from gEdit. that pastes in when I type header and then tap Tab.
And yet you've been consistently rude to me from the very first interaction, before I had even communicated with you. You haven't offered any sort of facts, reasoning, logic, code samples, debugging anecdotes, or anything at all. All you have been commenting on is how lazy, ignorant and crazy I am and threatening to "downvote me to oblivion". Let me be blunt here - consider getting therapy for your obvious anger issues.
Great progress /u/Forfunkle ! &amp;#x200B; You might want to look in to rasterizing your own polygons. That way you could experiment with phong shading, and textures. &amp;#x200B; You may even manage to do it in semi-realtime. It would be nice to see your meshes animating!
There you're wrong. I'm downvoting you as a purely retalitory strategy to what I observe you do. As for rudeness, I think youii need the therapy session more than I do, as you flew off the handle over the question "What are your reasoning for not spending the time/effort to learn using a real debugger?"
Thanks! I'll look into that. I'm looking forward to implementing Gouraud shading!
Sadly this doesn't seem to have the start TC. There's a field "time\_reference" that sounds like it should be it but it spits out "2826816001" (TC for this file should be 06:47:47.13).
Not really. He quit because people on the internet complained, not because he was overthrown. He was sick of their shit. In fact, got 2/3 of the vote, so he’s on the steering committee. The next highest vote getter was below 50% and there are I think 7 slots. He’s still well respected among core devs.
If you have tablets / smartphones lying around you could install termux, ssh, python. Then set up your device as the server. If your script does not need a lot of processing power then that would be very cheap.

Latest versions of PyCharm bundle their own JRE anyway.
I'm starting work on a programming project for school in which I've decided to program a tower defence game. Though it requires me to do loads of documentation and go through the stages of development using the waterfall cycle first so I haven't even started programming. As part of the research task I was going to create a subreddit and ask people what they'd like to see in the game but considering the fact I just made this account it'll take some time to be able to do that so I have a lot of work ahead of me.
PyCharm Community 2017.3.4 Portable (PortableApps.com Launcher) I have this. What is the problem, is it because it is portable ?
That's an ancient version. Just get [Jetbrains Toolbox](https://www.jetbrains.com/toolbox/app/) - it doesn't require administrator rights to install - and use that to install PyCharm.
Thanks. What is ancient, java or pycharm?
PyCharm. They're versioned year.release.patch, so 2017.x.x is from year 2017.
Thank you. So using this tool box will allow me to use pycharm without rights ? I downloaded it because it was portable.
Yes.
Okay. Trying it out now.
How do I change the install location to my flash drive?
I don't think you can - it installs to the user's home directory.
Then how can I use it on another pc? Thanks
Effective python is awesome. I also second fluent python. https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23020812-effective-python
So hold on. Is your end goal to have PyCharm installed on a flash drive, or is your end goal to have PyCharm installed without admin rights?
Both, actually. I am in my university so I don't have admin rights. There are many computers so I have to carry it on a flash drive.

Hah, got it! :-D
The logging module is great but it also terrible. It is way to complex internally for one off use, and there are a dozen lines of boilerplate before it will print anything at all. And the great irony in this context is that logging uses % style string formatting.
Raymond Hettinger showed a nice way to do it, with python, https://youtu.be/_GP9OpZPUYc
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
The list is awesome! Thank you very much for sharing.
Thank you.
Is this gpu accelerated?
Nope, it's on the cpu
If I only had to write csv files once, yeah.
It's a one liner in R. It takes the same number of lines in python for me to write to csv as it does in C, which is just wrong to me. Although I did find out that numpy has its own write to csv function that IS a one liner, so that solves 90% of my problem.
I am extremely lazy and writing csv/tsv files should be the most second-nature, intuitive, high-level command there is in python. Python is pretty much designed for data science. I don't have to fuck around with memory allocation and queuing in python, I shouldn't have to create a new object just to write an array to csv.
It literally just pings a few APIs and sends an email via http also. Pretty small stuff. I ended getting it setup with 1&amp;1ANOS because they had cheap as domains. Costs me like $3.22 NZD a month. But I mean if I can get it for over less or the same on a more reliable service that'd be dope.

x['ge-0/0/0']['rx_unicast_packets'] returns an int. It's, specifically, the 0 for rx_unicast_packets under ge-0/0/0 in your dictionary. There's nothing to iterate. To iterate over the contents of the dictionary, you'd want to do something like this: for iface_name, iface_props in x.iteritems(): if 'rx_unicast_packets' in iface_props and iface_props['rx_unicast_packets'] == 0: print(iface_name)
Thank you very much. It's always nerve-wracking for me to share something with the programming community.
If they get the reference, hire them. =\]
Great project!!

[Contemply](https://github.com/smertiens/contemply) has a built in template language with a parser/interpreter.
Super cool! Maybe you can look into how you can push calculations onto the GPU now that you're working with more complicates meshes.
Code golfing this a bit further: for iface_name, iface_props in x.iteritems(): if iface_props.get('rx_unicast_packets', -1) == 0: print(iface_name) The `.get()` method on dictionaries will return the second parameter (referred to as the default value) if the provided key is not present. In this case, I selected `-1` as the default value so cases where it was used would not print the `iface_name`.
Wow these are big projects. Thank you!
Yes it will. Thanks!
Thanks! I will read the documentation.
Nice! This reminds me of a 3D generative world I did back in my college days. Everything was made from scratch - from ray tracing to view transformation to rendering, shading, reflection...
it-s quite cheap on humble bundle now. check it out! You;d also get a lot of other books :)
You have done something that I always wanted to do - I'm a software engineer but always done "boring" software - so thank you for kicking off my brain with your renderer !
What did you use to achieve this? What game? I find game bots super interesting
Hey, I like this - although these days I use an IDE with a debugger, but I sometimes do some simple script using an editor, and this would be great for that
Python's logging module is slow as hell and can't be used in certain applications because of that.
I don't think dict destructuring is going to happen in Python. Using a JS-like syntax (`{a, b, c} = d`) is problematic because in Python `{a, b, c}` is a set display and I don't see a good alternative.
Thanks! At the moment, the program is pretty fast (about 1 second per thousand polys), and actually drawing triangles on the image is done almost immediately (so most of the expensive operations are done on the CPU), but you're right, when I get to try more complicated shading techniques I will have to switch to GPU
Thanks! Boring software is not fun to make, but it's important so, you're doing your part
Your data, when parsed from json, is stored as a nested dictionary. The top-level dictionary is made up of key-value pairs where the key is the interface name and the value is a second dict of properties of the interface. This second dict is a collection of key-value pairs where the key is the property name and the value is the property value. https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#dict.iteritems iteritems() is a method defined on dict objects that yields the key-value pairs in a dictionary. So, on the first iteration, iface_name is 'ge-0/0/0' and iface_props is the dict of interface properties underneath that in the json file. Then I check whether 'rx_unicast_packets' is in the properties dictionary. Perhaps you know your data well enough that you can guarantee that 'rx_unicast_packets' will always be a key in the properties dictionary, but I'm checking here just to be safe. Also, MrSpontaneous has a better solution to solve this in one call that you should look at. If 'rx_unicast_packets' is not a key in the properties dictionary, then the second expression in the 'if' statement - the one after the 'and' is not executed. If it is a key, then it's safe to execute the second expression, and check whether the rx_unicast_packets value is 0. Thus, if 'rx_unicast_packets' is in the properties dictionary, and the value is 0, I print the interface name.
Yeah I've been working on one for a while. &amp;#x200B; So far its lazily evaluated and has some optimizations its doing in the IR. Eventually i'd like to get the IR more optimized, and when I'm done with that I'm planning on converting it to C and compiling and outputting the results. Fun little side project!
Just ease of use. In IntelliJ IDEs I can just select all the files(or folders) that I want to add and hit `ctrl+alt+a`. They also finally added partial commit support so you can just select the lines you want to add without any extra effort. It's just easier than switching to a command line and performing the monotonous commands. If anything non-basic needs to be done then I can just switch to command line.
I smell r/surrealmemes
You have a sharp nose
Some next steps I'd recommend: * Upgrade to the numpy library. This will make your choice more readable and likely also faster * once you're using numpy, you can use scipy for your linear algebra operations * when you're comfortable with numpy, you could probably translate a lot of this to pytorch, which would enable you to leverage gpu accleration.
Good work tho, I love it!!
Chemical engineer here, learned some python in college, trying to refresh what I learned, but need a lot of help. I am using Spyder as my IDE, but it doesn't seem to work the same way as something like Jupyter notebook. When I type 40+2 and hit run in Jupyter, it returns the answer "42", but when I type the same thing into Spyder, it returns "runfile('C:/Users/(username)/.spyder-py3/temp.py', wdir='C:/Users/(username)/.spyder-py3')" and thats it. What is going on here? And if I wanted to install a package, lets say beautiful soup if I wanted to do web scraping, how would I even do that from Spyder?? If I type in "pip install bs4" and hit run it has no clue what I am talking about and returns this: &amp;#x200B; File "C:/Users/(username)/.spyder-py3/temp.py", line 1 pip install bs4 \^ SyntaxError: invalid syntax
I'm working on a new programming language inspired by Python, but it's meant as a *real* alternative to C++. It also doesn't try to be Python, or just a prettier C++, or a one-language-to-rule-them-all idea. Other inspirations are Rust (but no, won't have a borrow checker), Jai, and Odin. I'm writing the compiler using both C++ and Python. The C++ part is the main implementation, but Python is used as some kind of preprocessor that generates some of the C++ code. For example, the Lexer part is defined via idiomatic Python where I can easily change keywords / operators / etc, and then another piece of code (also written in Python) takes those keywords and generates an efficient token lookup that's faster than using a dictionary. The compiler will emit LLVM assembly (at least in the first iteration) and let LLVM deal with optimizations. So far only the lexical analyzer (the easiest part) is complete, but I'm currently updating my memory strategy and thinking about moving some of the parser logic into the analyzer itself (like brace matching) before I go back to writing the generator for the grammar. The hardest part is honestly the design of the language and not the implementation of the compiler.

Any time you see a repetitious pattern, that's a sign that the code can be simplified. Encounters don't need to be so repetitive. You should have a battle function that can take player and NPC inputs to perform the battle logic there. Player and NPC's should be subclasses of some sort of base Character class.. that will let you cleanly instantiate the many NPCs you'll be creating throughout the players journey. Inventory class for player inventory.. item class for items.. etc you get the deal. You ask yes/no questions everywhere.. User input functions should be a function: def query(msg): ... That should return a boolean. That'll clean that bit up.
I once threw the shrug emoji (with the somewhat involved Unicode) into a comment for a small py3 program I wrote internal to my company. I always knew when someone was running in py2 because the interpreter threw a (new to me) exception when trying to read that comment line because of the Unicode, which was not decodeable as ascii for py2.
Awesome

Here is one that I wrote. It is not a Turing complete language, but it does interpret code. The language is expressed in YAML configuration format as a tree of objects which are parsed and rendered by the core classes. The core classes can be extended to perform any type of business logic or rendering. I use it as a rapid application development tool. It lets me develop HTML, Javascript, SQL, and Python all in the same space. Here are some highlights from the docs: [http://webyaml.com/docs/design/processors](http://webyaml.com/docs/design/processors) [http://webyaml.com/docs/design/forms](http://webyaml.com/docs/design/forms)
We finally migrated our SaaS product and our custom helpdesk app to Python3 and to django 2.1 from 1.11 (we were using 1.8 just a few months ago). Tried to do our best on testing but still got production errors, most of them were comparatives where one of the variables could be None and failed to reproduce on testing. It is amazing how better py3 is compared to py2 , I did not any performance tests but it feels a bit faster on project reload, loved strings being unicode by nature and keyword only arguments.
&gt; And the great irony in this context is that logging uses % style string formatting. Why do you say that? Using % formatting ensures that the heavy lifting of formatting the actual string isn't done unless the log level is actually enabled, and a logger exists.
Thanks! Took a note of everything.

Sounds fun! Would you like to share a link to your work?
Oh God what the fuck why 😂 Good Job xD I didn't know this was possible...
That is what I was thinking while reading the documentation. This for now is on the edge of the list.
I’ve kind of been holding off on it until it’s done. I don’t feel it’s ready for the world to see haha.
Thanks! This was already commented by u/Cran3kill
Be prepared for class names like DependencyInjectorStrategyFactoryCreator , DatabaseConnectionInjectorFactory , RemoteHTTPResourceRetriever start making their way into Python from the Java world :) Nope, thanks
This is a project I've been working on for a while. The program can generate any Julia/Mandelbrot set and can zoom in anywhere on the set. A 1080p image takes about 6 seconds to generate. Hosted here: https://github.com/AgentElement/mandelbrot-set
It seems you used to rely only on yourself. Thank you for sharing your experience.
Sounds like you mix soft and warm :) Not sure if it's fair to say that dependency injection == java.
Thanks a lot! :)
I see. Will wait till it's ready. Thank you!
My problem I was having is calling a function from within another function. Is there a work around this? For example if I wanted to call that user input function from within the shop function
You can totally do that. Functions are Global
Thanks!
Oh okay. Thank you a ton!
I know exactly how and why the logging module works the way it does. The irony is as follows: 1. Best practice should encourage people to use the language standard debugger instead of using `print` for debugging. 2. The python `logging` module (which is in the standard library and is the defacto standard logger) defines a logging level `DEBUG` explicitly for this purpose. 3. f-strings now define this great formatting specifier for generating debug strings 4. Which is effectively ***incompatible with the logging module***. The right hand doesn't know what the left hand is doing here. Why are they adding debug features to f-strings, when f-strings aren't supposed to be used in logging, and when logging is supposed to be used for DEBUG. Best practice would have to be "don't use this cool new f-strings feature."
Tornado is the primary async interface used by dask AFAIK, and dask is modern, recommended, and performant. It might not be web-devvy, more focused on the numerical/computational type of dev (like yours truly), but it’s not like tornado is “deprecated”, which you sort of imply. The web dev community may have. True, Tornado is a bit ugly to use - but there is more complexity with async coding, some of that is inevitable (coroutines, “async await” etc)
I spent my training money on buying hardware to learn how to build stuff with MicroPython. Lots of nodemcu, and many raspberry Pis. Perhaps you can do that? There are things you can learn by deploying them on physical machines that you cannot on VMs. And I also bought an NVidia 1060 card so I could learn tensorflow.
If you want to make your code even better use a linter. I like flake8 but there are several out there. A linter nags you to write your code in the same style all over. At first I personally didn't like linting my code much but eventually I realized that when sharing my code with other people if it's formatted like the linter wants, it will be what people are used to seeing. http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/ Some editors (like https://code.visualstudio.com/) will integrate all that stuff for you if you want them to. It's really nice. Great job!
Just to add to my last comment; functions within a class need to be involved on th object or class itself (depending on whether or not the method is static). Functions defined outside of a class are global
Ah very cool, I didnt even think of that as an option. Very interesting. Thanks for the ideas!
Just for the benefit of those who may be learning from this post, `iteritems` didn't survive to make it into Python 3.
Helping my little brother with a school project called [AIY Voice Kit from Google](https://aiyprojects.withgoogle.com/voice/), which lets you build your own natural language processor and connect it to the Google Assistant or Cloud Speech-to-Text service, allowing you to ask questions and issue voice commands to your programs. All of this fits in a handy little cardboard cube, powered by a Raspberry Pi. We’re doing some Python script tweaks!
A few ideas: In "Refactor step 1. Use a closure" you have a `to_return` list that you populate as you go. You can instead use `yield` where you do `to_return.append(...)`. This is an excellent pattern to apply when you don't need your entire data set in the current function. In Refactor step 2: A helper function you can do yield as well, and at the call you can to `yield from add_zeros_for_missing_days(next_day)`. I realize that you need access to the previous value too, but you can make that work I think. Putting it toghether it'd look like this: def _iter_zero_days(first_day, until_day): for missing_day in range(first_day, until_day): yield (missing_day, 0) def water_per_day(filename): with open(filename) as fin: # Discard header line fin.readline() expected_day = 0 for line in fin: day, water_amount = [int(s) for s in line.split()] yield from _iter_zero_days(expected_day, day) yield (day, water_amount) expected_day = day + 1 print(list(water_per_day("input.txt"))) I don't see how a class makes this easier.
My biggest issue with TDD is I use pandas dataframe a lot and it can be tedious to setup those test in the pytest annotation.
Ok, but seriously now, I used Java and spring in the past for a few years. Since moving to Python I didn't have the need to use dependency injection. It's weird, I can't say exactly why, but it just didn't happen. The closest to that is when I setup a SQLAlchemy session manager threadpool and register it with the "app" object in aiohttp. Then the handler functions can access it from [request.app](https://request.app)\['....'\]. A simple approach like that works great. It could be solved with a dependency injector but at the cost of increased verbosity and complexity.
Hey, thank you for the reply. What does Django teach you that Flask doesn’t?
I want to build a chatbot for our Slack group. Sounds fun!
Hey thank you for the information. This is exactly the type of response I was looking for. Seeing as my goal is to learn more Python and become better at thinking like a programmer, it sound Flask would be the right choice for me. Thank you again!
IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate supports Java natively, Python through a plugin (giving it all of the features in PyCharm) and I believe C through a plugin as well (but if it doesn't, you can use CLion, another JetBrains product). If you _really_ want a single IDE, your best option is probably Eclipse, but the Python/C++ experience in it is pretty not good.
Everytime someone makes a skill the Amazon juggernaut gets a little stronger, congrats none the less
This looks like a job for /r/learnpython!
There's also [Black](https://github.com/python/black). It's nice not having to worry about proper formatting when coding.
Thanks for the advice! I wrote my own functions in order to understand exactly what's going on, but soon I will have to switch to a better and faster approach like scipy
Using `yield` is a neat idea I didn't consider! I'm glad you're taking the time to think about how to refactor code to be cleaner. Python is fortunate to have coroutines to make this possible, and I'm really looking forward to them coming to C++, personally. If you and your team are happy with the refactoring that you ended up with, great. I am personally not a huge fan of having `_iter_missing_days` floating about, but that's just my take.
[Google’s Python Class](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/) another great resource is [Full Stack Python](https://www.fullstackpython.com/)
Yeah I don't know how to render 3D objects from .JSON files.....if you have any idea about that then can you please share it?
How hard is it to set up environment stuff correctly if u use a plug in on intellij? I use pycharm for python but honestly intellij is superior
It's the exact same thing. Both IDEs run on the exact same shared code base, with PyCharm being a "plugin" on top of the core already.
+1 for fluent interfaces. Also practicing TDD is a great way to stick to some of the concepts you presented and stay away from anti-patterns (of course you have to write meaningful tests)
So if I create a new Projects it's the same but in Intellij?
Yes.
Do you mean with my program? Or in general? Because my program can only load .obj files, and I don't think .json is a mesh format
If you read the full article, you would see that the agents achieve profitability on test data they were never trained on.
While you are correct, no bot knows the future, many RL agents have shown extremely high performance at predicting time series data such as financial data.
Actually theres a website "pubchem" which give data about chemical compounds which also gives 3D structure and can be exported as .JSON file but the only problem that I face is to render the 3D structure in tkinter window from the .JSON file.....
A reminder from them would be nice, but I forgot to cancel and they put no trouble at all to refund it a few days later, so all in all no harm done.
I use Visual Studio Code for Python and Go. There should be plugins for Java and C++.

Ooh yes I keep meaning to try that, thanks for the reminder!
Some of them ... some of the time. But yes, as long as a market behaves just like it have done up to a point, the past can sometimes be used as a predictor.
Totally agreed. For those looking to practice TDD more, I can recommend they try a daily [code kata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kata_(programming))
Pluralsight maybe?
Interesting. Have you ever used Pluralsight yourself? how was it?
I've used netbeans for c++ and Java without trouble, but I can't beat vim and a command line for python work. Ipython is great for debugging, though.
If you can carry the overhead of always formatting the strings, I'd guess that logger.debug(f'{what=}{ever=}') would be the way forward.
I said its my first game..
Well, yep, I understand, and you're right about that. I also like simplicity... I'm a fan, but not a fanatic, of dependency injection. And by the way the described by you approach could be qualified as dependency injection technique as well. I talked about this with Andrey Svetlov, the Creator of aiohttp, on of the conferences and we finished on the statement that dependency injector approach is just another, more formal and general, way of [request.app](https://request.app)\['...'\] approach. &amp;#x200B; When people ask me about Dependency Injector and how is it beneficial I often state two main things: 1. It gives you a chance to better emphasize structure of your application 2. It segregates declarative and runtime parts of application lifecycle &amp;#x200B; In fact, it's just more formal way of what u're already doing. Dependency Injector is just a pythonic (or at least trying to be so) tool for doing this.
Alright thanks
Clarification, black is a code formatter. They recommend # for formatting [autopep8, black, yapf.](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/editing#_formatting) # for linting [pylint, flake8, mypy, pydocstyle, pep8, etc...](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/linting#_specific-linters) The VSCode tutorials on setting up an environment are good - https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/editing#_autocomplete-and-intellisense - https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/linting
The whole point of the logging modules is not to pay the overhead of formatting the output string, unless you have to. These features are incompatible with each other.
Ya, netbeans is a great IDE and very mature. I really like neovim/vim and terminal though.
&gt; Obviously I'm not going to be involved in any "requests3" release, at the very least without major changes to how their project is managed. Anyone know what he means here?
Hi! I had this dilemma and i LOOVE Python Crash Course. Its free on the interwebs or you can buy a copy for like 25$. Its really good since it teaches you in a practical manner not theoretical (which really helps me)
Then they should let a customer just purchase a license. Or do it like the good people over at Jet Brains.
Everything is a trade off. Ease of use vs. use of resources.
And that relates how? My point is that they have let the standard library fragment by adding features incompatible with existing features. If they think this is the way forward then they should deprecate logging. Its as simple as that.
If you are new to programming concepts, I suggest this book to my students: [The Super Simple Programming Book: Learn Basic Programming Concepts With Python](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1718198450) &amp;#x200B; For a more thorough look at Python, here's a good free one: [Think Python: How to Think Like a Computer Scientist](http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython/html/index.html) &amp;#x200B; Whatever you do, focus on Python 3, as Python 2 will [lose support](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0373/) in 2020.
Working on creating the simulation of the product that our company makes. It's to be done using Python. I've explored a few libraries like numpy, matplotlib, scipy etc. Thinking what could help more. Any suggestions ?
You can keep on using the preferred way of the logging module and keep the performance advantage. Or you can use the newer string formatting methods and pay the performance overhead.
It may depend on which version or spyder you have and how it was installed. I can't find that file on my system (Spyder 3.3.3 installed with anaconda), but I do see that file for Spyder 2.3.9 installed using pip.
How is Pycharm by the way? Never used it and I have to use it in my next project. I've always just used notepad++ and Jupyter once. Thanks in advance.
But what way is considered the best practice? What is my pythonic? One of the big selling points of python is that it is easy for developers to work with because there is one best way to do things, and it is easy for groups to share code because they all follow similar styles.
I'm not sure what you mean by "cleanest", but if you want to create quick GUIs, take a look at PyQt and its Qt Designer GUI tool.
Emacs!

Really good, but not for data science
There might be a slight learning curve, but it will make a word of difference once you learn of all the features. The type hints are pretty good and will prevent you from making some basic mistakes. The debugging tool is extremely useful. You can view all the internal data of objects, modify variables and objects, and view which thread you’re currently in. There’s a ton of other features such as remote debugging and framework support( Flask, Django, etc) that I could go on about.
i know what I consider pythonic when it comes to logging. That appear to be something else than what's pythonic for general string formatting. So to answer your questions: Bugger if I know.
thank you. I was wondering what you meant by correlating data? Is it like what caused the increase in income to happen?
Cheat Engine for memory/code dissection, then a few different python libraries to read memory and automate keyboard/mouse movement. I avoid memory editing since that's pretty easy to detect. Specific games I'd rather not get on their radar, but I have a badly written daily quest bot for a game that's currently very popular.
wxPython ftw
That's my point. This may be a great idea for the language, but they need to properly integrate these new features and figure out how to make them work, rather than throwing shit at the wall and seeing what sticks.
Install pygame and try creating some interfaces and programs. It's more rewarding and interesting seeing a visual program rather than just text, it can be quite a challenge as well.
I guess I just cover the basic state you mentioned with `git commit -a` and that works fine.
Eclipse supports all 3, but it takes a little tinkering to get C++ to work IIRC. Not my favorite for python development but it definitely gets the job done.
English
Neither am is sure to understand what you mean by "clean", but tkinter comes with python, no need to install anything else, is easy to use, and does the job for many kinds of GUIs Admittedly, it looks a little bit passé.
Qt is just cute.
At work, we're settled on 120 characters. 80 is fine if you're a fan of single character variable names and short function names, but I like to be a bit more verbose. And i have 2 4k screens!
I'm not familiar with building on Windows, and having a different language for errors (German?) is also confusing. So I can't tell what the problem is. Have you tried following these steps to configure it? https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/PCbuild/readme.txt And https://docs.python.org/3.8/extending/windows.html#building-on-windows I'm also wondering if the compiler can access the header files. I see it complains about arguments to PyCode_New, but if headers were missing it would complain about other issues.
First thing you need is termux, you can get it from the playstore. Termux is a free Linux Shell that lets you do a lot of things you could do on standard Linux distros. However that also means that you'll have to know the necessary commands. After you install termux you can install python3 and openssh. (For example by typing 'pkg install Python'). After that it's just standard ssh stuff. You can also do all the ssh-keygen stuff and configure the sshd_config so that oy certain IPs and users get access to the device. Furthermore hook it up to a power source and activate the wakelock so that the processing power is not throttled when in standby.
Try kivy. For me is the best.
You could try making a CHIP-8 emulator. If you know about bitwise operations, it should be easy. Just get the documentation and try it
Disclaimer: Still overall a "noob" in Python. I also really enjoyed Python Crash Course, and I've bought some of the others listed. It clicked very well with me, more than some of the more commonly recommended books. I purchased it from No Starch as I like to support authors and the folks who publish good things.
It’s tough to use a one tool fits all. As an analogy, I’ve got three different hammers in my toolbox because each works well with a specific task. If you can get away with using two IDEs, that would help you too. Good luck!
Check out this talk by Raymond Hettinger: https://youtu.be/wf-BqAjZb8M, he talks about why you shouldn’t follow pep8 blindly
Thanks! Awesome.
I go with "green, yellow, red" (79, 99, 119). I try really hard to stay green. I'll dip into yellow if it would be less readable otherwise, and I'll only go red when I start getting ragey and cannot fit it in without falling back to levels of absurdity that pervert the code into an abomination (which isn't in the spirit of PEP8). Never more.
The fastest and easiest is no doubts [PySimpleGui](https://pysimplegui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#the-window-designer) Might not be the prettiest but definitely the easiest.
Awesome, I have made a similar refactoring before but didn't know that it was an established pattern. Thanks for this, now I will do it more confidently next time. (-:

Raspberry Pi and a robot kit. Make it do stuff
The first thing I pushed for was 120 at my new job. Verbosity is better for readability, which is good because code is more often read than written.
That's pretty much what I do too, although I stick with 80, 100, 120. No sense in being less than those nice round numbers. And I'll go beyond 120 for things that really don't matter, like long strings that are just embedded data that is too much of a bother to wrap (especially in languages other than python that don't have adjacent string concatenation).
I'd use https://www.qt.io/qt-for-python over PyQT. PySide2 has a more liberal license and pretty solid documentation. The Qt Company have committed to supporting these Python bindings. I've been using them myself this week and they are really solid and fast. Also as you said, I would highly recommend using Qt Creator to create the layout visually, and then just load it like this: https://www.blog.pythonlibrary.org/2018/05/30/loading-ui-files-in-qt-for-python/
I love 80 characters. I use it in my personal files now, too. I especially like that it lets me fit 2 pages on one screen at a text size I like, no matter what device I'm on. I've kind of based my whole desktop workflow about being able to do that.
&gt; That's pretty much what I do too, although I stick with 80, 100, 120. No sense in being less than those nice round numbers. I think it's because an 80-character wide emacs screen starts wrapping at 79, not 80.
obligatory vsc is not an IDE
IDEA already does all that
I'm already going up to 120 if I feel like it, so that reason is kind of moot anyway.
Here's the part where he talks about line length: https://youtu.be/wf-BqAjZb8M?t=260
if you use the IDEs as and IDE, nothing beats it. if you just use it as an editor, ot's mediocre
LOL that was funny
You can use an IDE for a language you use a lot or do big projects with it and an editor for the other languages.
Using QT designer is way faster to design your GUI, because you don't have to code it. U can design the UI then save as .UI file and transform into .py file
Youre 100% right and i plan on buying it, except im on a third world country so ill have to wait to go to the usa where i can buy a physical copy. But 100% recommended
I like 80 quite a lot because when I have two buffers open vertically split on a laptop it still fits code quite nicely on one line without wrapping.
Haskell
PEP8 made perfect sense in a world of 640x800 displays.
3 vertical terminals in my setup leave me with 3 79char vim instances. Perfect.
Not free, but Zed Shaw's "Learn Python the Hard Way" is a great book.
On its own, probably it is not and an IDE - just a code editor. But with language-specific extensions it matches this [description from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment): &gt;An IDE normally consists of at least a source code editor, build automation tools, and a debugger. Isn't it?
Just use 88 or don't care and use black (which automatically formats to 88) https://github.com/python/black
[And here we go] (https://media.giphy.com/media/YPIrsRqqO7oB2/giphy.gif). My 2 cents: I still prefer 80 characters (79 actually); however, if it makes the formatting worse to wrap the code to save 3 characters, then I don't. Don't be dogmatic.
What platform is this running on? Windows or Linux? Also what graphics API are you using?
I did read a post here once from someone who had a visually impaired colleague. They set their font size very large, and 80 characters wide was about as much as they could fit on their screen. There's always something to consider!
Do the 80 characters include the indentation? Because 80 characters would really suck in an indentation-heavy language like Python.
It's running on Windows and I used Pillow for drawing 2D polygons
no, it's not. it's as much of an IDE as the excerpt you chose to quote is a summary of wikipedia's article on IDEs

Got it. I hope I didn't come across in the wrong manner. I agree that it is a great book.
It's actually 79 characters, and yes.
80 char line length is a godsend when having to edit/troubleshoot on a remote server you don't have the rights to configure.
I works ok for me. I do my python work in Vim, so I end up setting several :vsplit windows with the code that I’m working on until I run out of multiples of the linewidth. No wasted space that way.
Make your font bigger, tile your windows.
Try [`fiona`](https://fiona.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). It'll have a `properties` key for each record within the layer if the record indeed has properties (attributes).
Straight out of PEP8, "Readability counts": https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#a-foolish-consistency-is-the-hobgoblin-of-little-minds
I started using this a week ago and it has made formatting a non-issue. Highly recommend people try it out.
As someone who sometimes programs on their raspberry pi via ssh on a mobile phone, I propose a 40 character line limit
Looks like the video has been taken down? Perhaps this is a warning from the pro-pep8 mafia. I hear they leave a detached head branch of python 2.6 in your bed if you use tabs....
 &gt;And also (maybe more importantly) from a semantic standpoint I very much prefer shorter lines because it tends to make people write more explicit, less nested code. Force your juniors into 80 lines and now they have one more reason to avoid indent hadoukens.
The Kenneth Reitz fucktacular in which he conned people out of 30,000 dollars, tried to get NJS to do the work for free and then told everyone Tom is going to bring requests 3 home. Followed by an amusing proclamation in the third person that (paraphrasing) KENNETH REITZ owns requests, that's who!
Do you know where the number 80 came from? Punch cards. Punch cards have 80 columns. I don't happen to use a punch card reader to input my Python programs, so I'm gonna use 120 columns, thank you very much.
PyQt5 definitely
Yo that's pretty cool. It doesn't need to be rooted either?
flake8 limits it to 160 and im so comfortably with it
I follow 100 and tend to find if I have a section of code which requires enough indentation to be above that limit it'll be really hard to unit test anyway so it's a good sign for me that I'm too deep and I need to take a step back and re-evaluate.
Clearly you don't have enough files opened side-by-side.
