WAT. 
&gt;devarea.com/linear... The post (as its title say) is about Linear regression and not machine learning, I just mentioned on the first paragraph that it is one of the simplest models in machine learning
I upvote this for funny. I downvote this for Java. Ergo status quo.
Yeah, I think the consensus seems to be stay away from these places unless you have no other options. Financially I'm ok. I could keep training and working on projects for another year. I'm mostly just trying to get to the "next level" in Python and it couldn't hurt to get a little better with javascript. I'm definitely past the beginner phase. I also have to believe there are better options for entry level work so I'm going to pass on this. Meetups and maybe a bootcamp seem like possible next steps. Thanks for the advice all.
Indeed. That's why it captured my attention. I think it's time for "metabolically-oriented exoergonic biochemical cascades"... or, well, ..having lunch! 🤣😂
Looks awesome !
I’ve been playing around with the “cookie cutter” package. I use Django a lot and I wanted to make my own cookiecutter template for Django projects since I didn’t like the existing ones. 
Sorry I forgot to put the year.

Do you have a different suggestion for making some wonderfully organized Object-Oriented code? Or is OOP your whole issue with Java?
While the code is a bit confusing, it’s all written in python. I’ll try to add code annotations so it’s easier to understand
&gt;72% The competition is seething
Complete noob here. Where do you check for versions compatibility? Or were you referring to current python distros, coming with one or another version of numpy? 
This looks promising, but I'm a beginner, how can I just make a python project where I can write code from scratch and have like a folder with multiple files? There are a lot of different options, I'm not sure which one will give me that
I'm pretty sure they aren't shitposting about that
I thought you were joking 😔
Absolutely, since it's random you get some bizzare ones occasionally. I one time got the pepsi logo appear four times and it looked like a tasteless add.
Thank you :D

I automated my job and my co-workers' jobs; and now my boss hired for us teachers to teach us date science, financial analysis, etc. so we can work on more complex stuff and make more money. :'D
It looks like it gets the job done, and that's what really matters. I think putting comboboxes instead of entry fields would be nice for choosing formats though: from tkinter import ttk combo_box = ttk.Combobox(root, values=["English", "French", "Spanish"])

Hey there fellow nine-year-old, I tried running this and got a 400 error. ```HTTPError: HTTP Error 400: Bad Request```
i can absolutely imagine implementing it, was just curious how he did it, but lets wait for github ^^
Getting my april fools script ready: I plan on making my Bob Ross twitter bot start talking more and more about cthulhu/lovecraftian horrors as the day goes on. And I'm trying to get more use out of my e reader. I want to use it more but I normally send PDFs to it and those are a pain to read since there's no text reflowing. This week I'm working on a pipeline script that will string together multiple programs to try and convert pdfs/other documents to an ereader friendly format. Right now I'm trying to call a hello world python script from a chrome extension, so later I can use the extension to call the pipeline from my browser. 
yeah but the format codes are always different depending on what Youtube video it is.
I'm just starting a quick program to help me sort through and organize a backlog of photos. On that note - does anyone have any recommendations for modules that can read metadata from RAW files (.dng, .cr2, etc.)? I was going to go with Exifread until I realized that on my Anaconda installation it would require downgrading Pillow from 5.2 down to 3.4.2 :/
I liked this so much I double clicked the upvote button! 
Lol...wtf
Is ot feisable with my current knowledge
What sort of stuff do they use Python for?
Well... It's a joke but it doesn't mean it's not feasible. Don't give up. If it can be automated, Python is there for you!
What kind of stuff did you automate?
Op posts a lot in r/abdl, so I was wondering what that is: &gt; Age Play, Adult Diapers/Nappies, Diaper Lovers and Adult Baby. Apparently a fetish.
Thought it was a wholesome post but realised I'm just dumb as shit 
Look up what a **class** is and you can make a basic game. If you wanna make a game why do you even have to ask? Just try - be crap - and get better. That's how I learned.
Hmmm, I'm not seeing where you defined `temperature_f, humidity, wind_mph, pressure_hpa`.
What does incon mean? I'm too afraid to go there on college pc 
What do you do with the wax? asking for a friend.
I wrote a script that generated the config files for a full mesh vpn using openvpn with an arbitrary number of offices. I'll probbaly update it to work with wireguard eventually. 
As a person from Latin America this is fucking racist, and pretty hilarious at the same time 
not exactly what you're after, but pycharm has several documentation features: https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/viewing-reference-information.html it's not browseable, so you have to vaguely know what you want to know 
Python does oop super nicely too
Maybe look at [this](https://devdocs.io/). I tried it a while ago but didn't really test it that much. Looks like you can go to https://devdocs.io/offline and it will give you the option to download the documentation for offline use.
Incontinentia buttocks
As someone who's used both, there aren't many differences between pycharm and vscode.
I'm not sure about hosting your own copy of the documentation from a server, but there are options for downloading the documentation for offline reference. If you're on Mac OS, I'd highly recommend taking a look at [https://kapeli.com/dash](https://kapeli.com/dash). I've been using it for years, and it has saved me a ton of time in searching through documentation. It runs locally on your own system, and you can download documentation sets for different versions of Python, as well as a vast selection of other languages. There's a free trial which, if I recall correctly, is artificially limited by delaying the results. It appears that there are alternatives for Windows ([Velocity](http://velocity.silverlakesoftware.com)) and Linux ([Zeal](https://zealdocs.org)), though I can't vouch for those and I have no idea what their payment models are (if any).
Sure, python3 doesn't care, nor about the crunchbang. However, that modeline can also be read by vim, vi and emacs. Because for other projects I need to use Latin-1, I like to specifically call out my encodings.
I use Python to generate input files for ancient Fortran codes, run the simulations, and then process and plot the data all automatically. Back in the day someone would have to sit at a terminal, look at a book, and type out the input file line by line, but now I can run 1000s of simulations automatically just by using my custom-built library.
I have updated the post on stackoverflow
Neat. 
I'm writing an install software which coincides with SteamCMD which utilizes UPnP to make port forwarding for servers much easier
I automated a huge chunk of my job several years back and got a raise. Recently I automated social media posting, though I want to tweak the algorithm now.
&gt;rename it What? Do you really think that's how computers work or you are just trolling around.
We built an escape room for an industry conference which featured several electronic puzzles: two based on arduinos with motors &amp; buttons, the other running on a PC an HTML UI. &amp;#x200B; I (with like no prior python experience) managed to tie them together, so via a python script we could check player's progress, ensure things don't finish out of order, and have a one-button full reset for the room. After older escape rooms taking twenty minutes to put back together being able to press one button and boom done felt \*magical\*.
Expected value = $0 buy in * 100% + $200 winnings * 50% - $100 loss * 50% EV = 0 * 1 + 200 * .5 - 100 * .5 EV = $50 Pretty straightforward but a neat idea. Nice job!
Sweet
What is this, Pascal?
Niceeeee :D
pip installer checks the filename for compatibility. override it by changing the name 
I'm not sure I can say because of NDA :/ So instead I will link to them talking about it. https://code.fb.com/production-engineering/python-in-production-engineering/ https://lwn.net/Articles/758159/ Also Instagram is owned by Facebook and it is pretty well known to be the largest Django app in existence. 
MD, DFT or something else?
So how do you know if a given piece of code will work properly in 3.7 or require 3.8? Is there a proper pythonic way of expressing "this code relies on features in 3.8"? For example, there was the recent change where dicts are now "ordered". Code that relies on that will probably run without a syntax error, but will producing a possibly undetected logical error.
Cool! That's a really good book.
Binary Collision Approximation actually - ion-matter interactions.
Building a virtual, console based automation tool for DnD. Mainly die rolls, character creation, and combat tracking. May go further later. 
Very nice! Even though the point about not losing money is made clearly, I would suggest that a histogram is a better tool for visualising the results of 100 experiments.
I'll be just a little upset if it ever moves to Python4 and then I need to have 3 separate python interpreters hahaha
How come the expected value doesn't match OP's experiment? it's above $1000 for him
I thought when we exiled Guido we got rid of that accursed thing?!? I can't use that... it gives me Pascal PTSD.
I'm just starting with it and I'm loving it. I managed to query and change values from a Web.config file. We work with at least two different data bases and changing that value made me roll my eyes every time. Also, a colleague made a script for building a .Net project from command line and it's now integrated with my script. As I'm bound to Windows, I searched how to call a script with a keyboard shortcut, and every time I want to do any of those things I press ctrl + alt + B.
Single trial vs 100 trials, multiply 50 by 1000 and you’ll get the expected value for the whole experiment. 
What do you use for automatic social media posting? Instagram API and such?
If you expect to make $50 on a flip, flipping the coin 100 times should earn you $5000 (50*100).
Learning PyQt. Going to try and take a program I wrote a while ago in C#, and rewrite it in Python.
I use one of the partners that Instagram allows to post automatically - Buffer. They have an API that I use to call and post.
Just i use the maps to practice the tsp.
I started recently but i made a script to log into a list of juiper switches weekly, queries the switches for alarms and then sends the info to my email account. I also set another script to backup the config of the juniper switches to a network share weekly. I am using pyez for python.
Automated the data collection for a research project that I am working on. Downloads the updated database, scrapes it for links to the detailed information hosted on individual pages, goes to those pages and scrapes them for info and links to PDFs, downloads the PDFs and parses them and puts it all into a data frame. I’m working on automating the statistics side of the dataframe once all of the information is in it, but I’m not quiet there yet. 
Awesome!
Use [sys.version_info](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.version_info) to determine the version. 
Cool! Now you will find yourself simulating/estimating/calculating lot things that you see/hear.
Did you get a youtube API key?
that's just not true. core functionality is basically the same, but pycharm does more. that's a fact. if you disagree you aren't using and/or don't know about the features pycharm has the one thing i can think of that vscode has is lacking in pycharm is live collaboration
Thanks. Yeah, it is pretty straight forward. Although, I didn't calculate the expected value. What I did is simulate the experiment 100 times and plot the outcome against each instance. Even then the logic is pretty straightforward. Total_money = # of heads * 200 - # of tails *100. I shared this because I was excited being able to complete a project on my own for the first time.
The question is how to determine the required version *of* given code, not how to determine the interpreter version.
I did a simple automation of that involved web-scraping. Essentially pulling out static information from JIRA and dumping them to MS excel for some sort of report creation to be sent as mail. 
Like I said in the comment above, the expected value is not shown. Rather the outcome after 100 coin tosses.
Sure that gives the code access to what version it's running on. But that doesn't answer my concern. But let's say you're reading some code on a blog or github and you just can't get it to work right. I can obviously tell what version I'm running... but how do I know what version the developer was writing this code on? That is, what's the PEP-sanctioned way of including in the source code "this program requires features in 3.8 or later". Because whatever it might be, it's extremely rare in any of the code I've seen. There doesn't even seem to be a proper way (or at least commonly-used way) to indicate a piece or code requires Python 2 or 3, let alone more nuanced distinctions as between 3.7 and 3.8.
Yeah, a histogram does sound like a better way to visualize this. Will update the code in a bit.
The Expected Value is the average amount you should expect to win (or lose if negative) per coin flip if you do an arbitrarily large number of flips. You can't even get exactly $50 per flip, but if you do 1000 flips, you'd expect to win $5000, or an average $50 per flip. He correctly predicted an average winnings of $5000 on 1000 flips, and you can see that in his plot as well.
Agreed. One of my favourites in the field of behavioural psychology and decision strategy.
He was on Sam Harris' podcast recently. May be of interest to you. They spent a good amount of time discussing this phenomenon. 
What is automated specifically?? It generates post phrases for you..?!
I thought it was great! Expected Value is just a good concept to talk about along with probability problems, especially gambling ones. I thought it was worth mentioning to add some context. Good job, and keep it up!
I pull dictionary definitions for a language product and pull pictures related to those definitions and post on Instagram
I fixed it - thanks!
I have just started learning win32com so will be testing out few scripts to download mail attachments automatically
Physical integration with Python is very cool stuff. Can you elaborate more on what is reset and also how the electronics interface with the room itself?
Just started python this week i have some java backround. I really love python, you can do soo much witb so little. It is also soo much easier to learn comp to java. Ive already created some fractals using recursion and turtle. Im currently working on custom code for l systems also using turtle. Any things you recommend I attempt next? New packages to learn etc.
Thanks for the suggestion. Will check it out.
&gt;pip install --user twilio On Windows 10, running the command returns: `C:\Users\-----&gt;pip install --user twilio` `'pip' is not recognized as an internal or external command,` `operable program or batch file.`

McDonald's have an online survey that takes like 5 minutes, after which it gives you a code that you write on the receipt and redeem it for a Big Mac and Fries for £2.98. I used Selenium to automate filling in that survey, meaning I can fire up my script to fill the form in like 10 seconds and get a new code I can use. Probably not the 'best' automation I've done but it was definitely super fun and a good example to showcase to non-technical people what can be done with programming.
Post your code! 
Anaconda environments ftw! 
That's not a problem with `pip` nor with Windows. It's because you haven't set it up correctly. Add `.../Python/Scripts` to the PATH and it will work. 
Calling Word, open an RTF document, save it to PDF and close the window, all in a background silent task running on Flask. You have no idea how much trouble this saved me compared to PDFCreator and such solutions.
Oh my...that is beautiful. 
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St.\_Petersburg\_paradox#Samuelson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Petersburg_paradox#Samuelson) Not quite the same but interesting in terms of the expected number of runs in a random sequence 
Does he say "a" coin flip? I probably wouldn't do it either even considering the odds are in my favor. The power of house gambling comes from gambling *many* times
Can we get a transcript of this? I need this for personal reasons.
yeah /s means serious
I'm working on CI configuration for our project on gitlab
Automated drafting and managing my fantasy baseball, football, and basketball teams. I enter an ESPN live draft waiting room manually. After that, my code waits for the draft to start. Once the draft starts, it enters the draft room for me and drafts my team. After the draft, it sets my lineup every day and adds/drops players as necessary. 
I'm working on a [script](https://github.com/ewen-lbh/mx3-publishr) to automate music publishing 
Automated updating my resumé with the latest number of downloads for my application and compiling it's LaTeX. Whenever a user clicks on my website for it, the resumé updates if the last update was more than a day ago. Don't think anyone clicks on it but pretty nifty.
Whew, I thought this was going to end badly.
That's called the [Monte Carlo Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method) and it's super useful. You might consider a larger sample size than 100 if you want to see some money lost too.
Here you go. Not the most efficient coding. But, I am still new to this. Any feedback is highly welcome. import random import csv import matplotlib.pyplot as plt # csv file csv_file = open("Coin Toss.csv", 'w') csv_writer = csv.writer(csv_file) csv_writer.writerow(["Number of Experiment", "Total Money"]) # Setting Parameters number = int(input("Enter the number of times you would like to execute this experiment: ")) record_list = [] total_money_list = [] def experiment(): n = 1 heads = 0 tails = 0 while n &lt; 101: toss = random.randint(0, 1) if toss == 0: print(toss, "It's a Heads") heads = heads + 1 record_list.append("Heads") else: print(toss, "It's a Tails") tails = tails + 1 record_list.append("Tails") print("-------", int(n), "-----------") n = n + 1 total_money = (heads*(-100) + tails*(200)) total_money_list.append(int(total_money)) print(total_money) print(record_list) print(total_money_list) print("Number of Heads : ", str(record_list.count("Heads")), "Number of Tails : ", str(record_list.count("Tails"))) no_experiments = [] for i in range(number): no_experiments.append(int(i)) print(i + 1, "New experiment") print("\n\n") experiment() print("\n\n") csv_writer.writerow([i + 1, total_money_list[i]]) plt.bar(no_experiments, total_money_list) plt.ylabel("Total Money") plt.xlabel("Instance of Experiment") plt.show() csv_file.close() 
This is effectively a [Monte-Carlo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method) method. Eventually the value will converge on the EV. 
Great work. I’m a huge fan of Thinking Fast and Slow. If I may, I recommend learning how to use GitHub. It’s a great way to share code. 
Not me but I helped the guy who built it... We have complicated reports that calculate and show which call tickets are the most important to update if we want to minimize damage to SLA. These are spread amongst hundreds of support groups with specific methods to contact them. We mapped as much information as we could in excel to include information as to who just be reached, how, how many times we said it already, where it just be escalated, ect. It took 10 people the entire day to send out the notifications. We automated this with tools so that one person could do it in less than an hours time. We could have went further and fully automated it but we found it was best to keep a human eye on things for interprétation purposes. 
Please share when finished. Also adding a vertical line/shading to represent the expected value and average of results with a clear title and labels will also make this /r/dataisbeautiful worthy.
I don't think you could lose money with larger sample size. Instead, you would see an increase in your gains.Given, how the odds of losing money decreses with each coin toss.
I schedule production runs at my company :) I work for a mid-sized tortilla manufacturer, and we produce a couple hundred different SKUs, each with differing brands, recipes, certifications, etc. It may not seem it, but the *order* we schedule production runs in is important. For instance, if you were to change recipes from an allergenic product to a non-allergenic product, or a conventional product to a Certified Organic product, this would require a full cleaning of production machinery *even if* that machinery would have otherwise been cleaned well-within spec for another recipe. **TL;DR**: Put non-allergens before allergens, conventional products before NonGMO before Certified Organic, etc. (Certs are a bit more complicated than that but you get the idea) Since this was previously being done by human hand, it had caused some major inefficiencies with cleaning routines. I think the reason nobody looked into automating it before was because there are a lot of external considerations to account for. For example: if a customer rushed an order, or if we somehow run out of ingredient for a particular product, the system can't be so rigid as to deny the importance of those variables. What I did was connect our warehouse system and accounting system to production, and offer automated recommendations as to what today's schedule should look like given all the data we have. From what I gather, that suggestion is followed more than 90% of the time. 
&gt;I wont bet because I would feel the $100 loss more than the $200 gain. I’ll take you on if you promise to allow me to make 100 such bets. AKA, how insurances work :)
Yup! Okay so, bear with me. (I'll see if I can dig out some pictures too if people are curious. ) We typically don't build escape rooms as a job, this is a once a year thing for this conference. We ripped all the furniture out of a hotel room &amp; used mostly hardware and gadgets we already had or could be bought within our \~$2,000 parts budget from Amazon. &amp;#x200B; **Structure** So the room was set up so that the PC acted as the "master controller" for the whole room, with my python script as a back-end to kick everything off and a fancy UI built using a tool called [Storyline.](https://articulate.com/p/storyline-3) (Storyline generally isn't used for something like this but our "real" jobs are building online training so we already had it and knew how to use it). The PC only had a game controller available to players, to prevent them from fiddling with keyboard shortcuts or clicking around. Our two arduino devices were built similar: they had buttons wired directly on with tiny LCD displays, and based on other information available in the room players would press buttons the right way, triggering a motorized container to open and dispense a key to continue on with the puzzles. One was connected to the PC via USB serial, python would monitor the serial connection in a loop once every few seconds. The other was actually wifi-enabled and hosted a simple HTTP server right on the chip, it could respond to [http://192.168.1.2/](http://192.168.1.2/) with it's status of solved/unsolved and [http://192.168.1.](http://192.168.1.2/)2/?=open (or closed or reset) would override whatever it was currently doing and move the drawer. The python script could poll it too over the WLAN. Initially I tried to use Flask to get the HTML5-based Storyline interface and Python talking, but then came up with something simpler and more reliable: pretend keyboard shortcuts. I could easily fullscreen &amp; refresh Chrome via the python script to launch our UI, then once running Storyline is able to map any keystroke to any javascript-style trigger you want. **How it would actually flow:** 1. I launch python script by SSH-ing into the computer, so I don't need to be in the room. Reset command is sent to USB arduino and the reset URL for the wifi one. Chrome refreshes, starting the UI over. 2. Users enter room. Python script pauses. Other employee gives the rules and safety briefing and when he says "Go!" I hit a key to make the python script continue. It sends a simulated keypress to Storyline, kicking off Storyline's timer and giving us a nice countdown to show the users on the screen. 3. Users solve some non-technology'd puzzles to get the information they need for the wifi-enabled puzzle. After entering the right button combinations, the motorized door opens, handing them a key to open a locked door and actually gain access to the area containing the computer and following puzzles. 4. Users usually go right for the PC since it had a really big screen, solving the puzzles we built in Storyline. Once these puzzles are solved, Storyline advances to a certain screen with a hint about searching for more puzzles. While on this screen, it can accept a "you win" keypress. 5. The USB arduino puzzle is constantly being polled. It takes several steps of clue-finding to get all the information you need to solve this arduino-based puzzle. (I was actually very evil with this and tried to copy "Keep Talking And Nobody Explodes": the instructions for how to defuse this device were affixed to furniture on the other end of the room, requiring players to yell information back and forth about what the Arduino's display had vs what the directions said.) 6. Once the arduino responds to the looping "are you defused" USB requests with "yes", THEN a final simulated keystroke is sent to Storyline. It will keep looping sending this keystroke every five seconds, just in case the PC has not yet made it to the final screen. Usually defusing the "bomb" comes last, but some groups surprised us and managed to do it out of order, so this did come in handy. 7. Once (finally) the players have gotten Storyline to it's final slide and defused the bomb, THEN the keystroke will trigger a "you win" message and stop the timer. 8. Once the players have left, we put the key back in the drawer, double check the room for sanity/safety sake, and I kill and restart the python script. The script's launch process sends the reset command to the USB and wifi arduinos, and the wifi arduino pulls it's drawer closed. And bam, we're back to square one.
Definitely a part of the plan. If I may ask a supplemental question to this. Is including your beginner projects in your github repo a good practice to showcase later for a grad school application? I am an EE undergrad, looking to get into grad school later this year. And, I am told having a knowledge in a programming language goes a long way in the grad admission process. I plan to do some more intermediate or advanced python projects to showcase my skills.
See article on the release: [https://news.engin.umich.edu/2019/01/an-upgrade-for-open-source-3d-nanoscale-imaging-software/](https://news.engin.umich.edu/2019/01/an-upgrade-for-open-source-3d-nanoscale-imaging-software/) Sorry about the late post. I try and share each of our major releases with this subreddit. Keep your eyes peeled for our upcoming spring release!
I meant the number of experiments. &gt; “…the aggregated gamble of hundred 50-50 lose $100/ gain $200 has an expected return of $5,000 with only a 1/2300 chance of losing any money and a 1/62,000 chance of losing more than $1000” You haven't being doing enough experiments to see those. Also, two bits of Python advice. Don't do this: csv_file = open("Coin Toss.csv", 'w') Rather do this: with open("Coin Toss.csv", 'w') as csv_file: # Rest of your code goes here Put the the code that depends on that file in that `with` block. As soon as your code exits the block, the file closes. So you can't forget to close it. But also, if your code exits unexpectedly (an exception for instance) your file still gets closed properly. And the second one is that you can simulate a coin toss with: if randint(0, 1): # your code here 0 in Python is falsy in boolean a context, so 0 or 1 is pretty much true/false, you don't need the `==`.
It's quite late here. And I have an exam tomorrow. Will definitely update later in the day.
I've only started using Pyright for a few days, but it's *much* faster than mypy, and seems to give me more accurate and clear error messages. mypy would sometimes give me strange false positives.
Don't neglect a review for your exam. There's no deadline here.
Yeah. Kahneman goes on in quite depth about the how companies and insurances exploit this risk aversion to make monetary gains. Fascinating stuff.

Have you tried different seeds for the random #s?
I don't think it can hurt. Besides, GitHub is fun to use and knowing how to use it allows you to participate more in the tools you use. Also, you might want to look into [Micropython](https://micropython.org), especially if you want to use python in EE projects. It lets you use python where before you would've needed to use C (microcontrollers with few resources).
It seems that YouTube's API has limits as I just left this running for a while and started getting errors. I guess YT doesn't like a call every second or so. I added in a 5 second timer.
I plan to move from a small town to a major city when I graduate. Concerned with choosing which neighboring cities to live - with traffic as a consideration - I automated collecting traffic data over a week. It collected the travel time between ~10 home addresses to ~10 "work" addresses both to and fro every 15 mins. After a week, I was able to answer all sorts of questions I had about travel times and feel I can make a more educated decision come moving time (**two more months btw! **). 
It's really hard to determine what you're doing wrong without seeing the code.
Why not just use Geant4? They have binary interactions and there are c++ and python hooks to run the events. 
Guido approved the := (I think they call it the walrus operator) and then stepped down. So the walrus is kinda his last will while in charge.
Great reply. Just checked myself and yeah even 10k samples don't get you reliably close to the 1/2300 :) &gt; And the second one is that you can simulate a coin toss with .. To add onto this, OP check out numpy. You can simulate all your coin tosses at once with import numpy as np n_toss = 100 n_experiment = 10000 flips = np.random.random(size=(n_experiment, n_toss)) and then move one somewhere like mask = flips &gt; 0.5 flips[mask] = 200 flips[~mask] = -100 returns = flips.sum(axis=1) Have fun!
For a small script like this, I'd be inclined to post it as a gist ([https://gist.github.com/](https://gist.github.com/)) rather than a full Github repo. Assembling a showcase is useful for education and employment.

If you run your code for a long time and get a discrepancy from his numbers, note that Kahneman's quoted probabilities aren't exact. The exact probabilities your result should trend toward are 553785737846639752356280235/1267650600228229401496703205376 \approx 1/2289.06 (probability of losing money), and 2547978918306278976189325/158456325028528675187087900672 \approx 1/62189 (probability of losing more than $1000).
This sounds interesting but as someone who has done maybe a dozen escape rooms, the idea of the puzzles just being electronic with nothing to physically reset doesn't seem like a fun escape room.
So, is there python involved, or just go? At a first glance, there's no mention of python.
Well done! Code looks neat but there is a major issue regarding usage of functions imo: * You're letting the experiment() function poke at global variables that doesn't belong to it (total\_money, record\_list, total\_money\_list) when it really doesn't have to. Make it return the results from a particular experiment instead and do the aggregation of results outside experiment(). This style of using globals inside functions is valid python but IMO it can be a major source of headaches. Functions should be self contained as far as is practical. * Use a main() function and an if \_\_name\_\_ == "\_\_main\_\_": block . This forces you to scope your variables properly and makes experiment() importable from other scripts. &amp;#x200B; Also: * Use context managers instead of open() and close() directly. * The while n &lt; 101 can be replaced with `for n in range(n_iterations):` , this saves you iterating n yourself and the awkward syntax of n &lt; which is prone to off-by-one errors. &amp;#x200B; Good luck!
There are 2 main reasons I can think of off the top of my head, one practical and one historical. Practically, Geant4 is kind of overkill for our application (plasma-wall interactions for fusion). We have a very limited energy range (up to keV, but the bulk in 10s to 100s of eV) and the code we're using was designed and validated for this energy range specifically and is incredibly lightweight and fast (meaning we can very effectively run many instances of the code in parallel on a given supercomputer). I've been told conversationally by someone who has worked with the codebase that Geant4 is not exactly a lightweight code. Also, a very cursory glance shows that Geant4 may not include Lindhard-Scharff stopping natively; this would be a problem for our energy range. Historically, my impression is that Geant4 was built for high energy physics. Our code was built for plasma-wall interactions (and ion-beam experiments). Interestingly, the two fields have very little cross-over, so almost nobody I've spoken to in my field has ever used Geant4. Additionally, In-house control of codes can be a big deal for DOE projects; you'll often see one national lab write their own code from scratch just to avoid using another lab's code. We actually discussed using Geant4 once a long time ago, but the idea was dismissed out of hand. Now, someone in our group is rewriting the old Fortran code in modern C++, but this is more to facilitate future in-memory code coupling than it is to have better performance. 
Then the coup was in vain... :-(
Fuck any site that makes me create an account just to see the entire job description.
It had physical stuff too, I skipped over a lot in my explanation to only touch on the code-related things and also not give away all the puzzles. Typically, users would have to do some physical action(s) to ultimately obtain a word or number, then that word or number was helpful on an electronic. Our previous escape room had them do physical activities for keys, and the problem with by the end you had like, a fuckload of keys, so players would lose track of which had/hadn't been used, and we'd have to collect them all and manually re-lock lots of things.
yes, no
* for the co-workspace: the creating of new clients in the database and checking them in and out when they get into the workspace. booking conference rooms. * for the courses (engineering for kids): emailing a specific list of students by the new courses and registering the courses for them and buying the tools needed for the course and returning any not used tool and replacing damaged tools. 
/r/learnpython
actually i worked secretly on the software and then told my boss 'how about we use a software to do these tasks so our team can focus more on data analysis and stuff like that so we can make you more money' .. i made a good case 
It wasn't a coup, he resigned because he was kinda burned already and the discussion against this specific feature got heated. I'd take 10 more walruses if that would bring Guido back though. :/
/r/learnpython I'd say this subreddit (/r/python) is more suited for discussing the language itself, whereas your question would fall more into mentoring and learning.
Thank you 
I automate a bunch of Jupyter Notebooks for usage tracking and reporting for a SaaS product. Done ruin hourly, some daily, but they all generate stats and data that goes to a product dashboard.
Awesome! Also, I wish you all success in this new city, mate. My own "graduating history" was pretty similar. Cheers!
Went live with my first web application, written from scratch. It's a simple game based on mathematical intervals. Check the web app at: [knowlift.com](https://knowlift.com/) Will plan on developing it further with more games, maybe even some games that are user-generated, etc. The game is open source, link for the repository in the footer of the web app &amp; of course contributors are welcome. Peace! &amp;#x200B;
&gt; If all I cared about were desktop apps, that is how I would do it but you really can't do that on mobile You actually can, in fact python-for-android (maintained by the KIvy project) supports a webview app type designed for use with something like flask running on the Android device. It isn't that well maintained because no active contributors use it, but the concept is sound.
/r/learnpython
Thanks I'll delete my post
Yes its good to post them. You can have a repo called Python Projects for example and it will mimic a Python Projects folder in your PC so you can organize it however you want with subfolders, a README and even a free web page design from Github's templates so it looks nice. Learning git and Github is like learning Python. Its easy to get started but its a whole new world when you dive into it. Don't be scared to jump in.
\`\`\` \# run me a billion times or whatever from random import randint FLIP\_LIMIT = 100 flips = \[randint(1) for \_ in range(1, 100)\] total = (sum(\[f for f in flips if f == 1\]) \* 200) - (sum(\[f for f in flips if f == 0\]) \* 100) print total \`\`\`
This sounds neat. I'll be moving in about a year. Any chance you can share what you have? 
Man I love python. I'm learning C++ in my uni but it's a pain in the ass to work with it. I redesigned a [Hearthstone Fatigue Damage Calculator](https://github.com/marioortizmanero/hearthstone-fatigue-calculator) yesterday. For those who don't play HS, fatigue damage is damage dealt after a player runs out of cards. When they draw a card after that, they'll get 1 damage. Then, 2 damage. Then 3. And so on until infinity. The thing is that there's some decks that use lethal damage to kill and it can be a bit annoying to calculate. I had previously done it with loops as it's just a sum, but I learned about the **Trapezoidal numbers** which make it WAY more optimized, and dictionaries, which made the menu simpler. You can learn more in the readme 
Why? There's a reason why a separate file is produced for every major version. What's wrong with calling: `pip install numpy` and letting it compile for your python version?
Much appreciated! 
In `setup.cfg` you can add: [options] python_requires= &gt;= 3.8.*
I think what I suggested would be the appropriate method. To take the dictionary example, check whether the version is less than 3.6, and if so, use an `OrderedDict` instead of a regular dict. More generally, this isn't really a problem. Most people don't just copy random snippets of code from blog sites. Most people use pip to install packages from the Python Package Index (PyPI), which supports tagging Python versions through `setup.py`. For an example, see https://github.com/praw-dev/praw/blob/master/setup.py. 
Learning flask to create a splash page for my in home server. 
Certainly! Full transparency: I haven't touched it in 8 months and there are quite a few things I'd change. For one, rather than writing to a database, it writes all data to a csv locally. Should be pretty easy to make those changes - and I definitely plan to at some point. There are also a host of other wonky choices I made that I'd do quite differently now but it should get the job done. I also wrote it to be fairly plug and play so, theoretically, you should be able to toss in your own starting/ending addresses, grab a Google api key, and hit go. Hopefully it works as intended! You can fine it [here](https://www.github.com/mcole22266/traffic_data). 
Thanks!
Am planning on making one of these as well as a beginner project. How long did it take you to make this?
Story time: back in December, my company’s site they use to host videos was shutting down by the end of the month. So we needed someone (me, the new guy) to painfully redownload every single video from this hosting service’s servers, which would get downloaded as a cryptic 16-digit string of random text and digits. So I’d also have to rename rename them to the appropriate titles of the videos, and then upload them to Vimeo. I had to do this for every video. I had just started getting really into Python and scripting and I knew one thing: if I’ve got to do the same, menial task over and over again, I can get that done with Python. So I spent the rest of the workday creating a script that would loop through each download link, find the appropriate video title, rename the file, and store everything in a neat “Videos DONE” folder. Uploading to Vimeo was the easy part, and got done by hand. I think I was given something like 2-3 days to get this project done, and so I got to just laze around doing nothing for two days with all my free time. Caught up on a lot of GoT and TWD. Oh, and another part of the script was going through every page on our site and changing the html of the videoplayers to link to the Vimeo URL. I just remembered that part. That was an interesting one as well. TL;DR: You can always automate the boring stuff with Python. If it’s menial and monotonous, robots can do it faster and better than you!
There was a website that had music you could download for free but you had to make an account and refer friends to download a zip version rather than each song individually. So I downloaded each song individually with a python script.
There is the [pydoc](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pydoc.html) module in stdlib. *Batteries included*
After checking the projects out looks like both of these projects started from their previous success with another language and they just wanted to adapt it it to Python. In case of Facebook, looks like they used their PHP fork called Hack. In case of Microsoft they used their JavaScript fork called TypeScript. Having a choice might be actually a good thing as long as they don't introduce incompatible annotations.
I did enjoy the *Python Cookbook* (3rd edition) not only for the recipes but also for the discussions surrounding some of the solutions. 
Jinja is not about HTML only! It would be perfectly fine for this kind of problem. If it is no burden for you to have one additional dependency, just go for it. 
There is also [pytype](https://github.com/google/pytype). but it doesn't support Windows. I'm turned off by pyright's use of typescript. I want something I can specify in my `tox.ini` file. I forgot about pyre-check. I'll have to see if that will work for me.
I can only think of two possible walruses: `:=` and `=:`
I started automating plants watering using Micropython. For now it's only measures soil moisture, but you can check it out here: https://link.medium.com/RSBjLOTDnV
Have you done all you can to understand the project? Have you read all the material, tried the practice problems, tried your own practice problems? Is there a discussion form where you can talk with other students. Have you contacted your professor for tips/help? You don't need to pay anyone to figure this out. Part of the process is to work through it, with no shortcuts. You will learn the most that way.
Built a library to automate the boring stuff of a major software vendor, which offers a cloud platform that has no API ("It's coming, we swear").
Holy cow! Can I get that script 
macOS has Python 2.7 version installed by default; if you want to use Python 3 you have to use `python3` command
I may be completely wrong about this but, when you installed Python 3.7, did you add it you our system variables? There should be a check box or whatever in the installed and if not, then you can just add it yourself. At that point should be able to choose it like you would any other (bottom left corner, click on the current python installation, all installations will appear at the top, select one.) You may be able to go into the preferences &gt; settings &gt; Workspace settings &gt; Extensions &gt; Python and just input the file path there. I don't work with MAC or anything, just trying to help.
It's nothing special or great code but here it is: [https://pastebin.com/J9m4LpNR](https://pastebin.com/J9m4LpNR). It's made just for me (e.g. Chromedriver path and order) so don't be surprised if it doesn't work for you (though you could make it work).
Don't forget about the double walrus `:==:`, also useful for testing true object identity. ^/s
I have a trello board where I can dump youtube links for songs I hear. It pulls them with youtube-dl to an ec2 host. Later I sync them down, convert and normalize them, then throw them in my phone. I could probably do all this on the host side, I'm just too lazy to fix it.
Currently in the process of automating the assignment of Help Desk tickets to the correct internal group using machine learning. Initial testing looks promising! The current proposal will have the program automate around 50% of new tickets. 
Yeah. I wouldn't consider JSON a language though, more a way of storing and sending data. Same thing with the HTTP headers

Soy has a futures market, just saying..
I mean technically, I automated a paycheck. I'd write code and they kept putting money in my bank account.
This worked thank you, I had to find the pathway settings
Do you know if it works on iOS too? That would be cool. 
I didn't define the iterables because I figured it wasn't so relevant to the point. Do you think it'd be worth including some pretend definition or comment clarifying that they are iterable objects?

I wrote simple library to create scripts to automate as400 warehouse management system called Reflex. Once I was involved into project where I had to plan work for 8 FTE for one week. They had to do some kind of boring job with changing some data about skus. I let them work and in the same time start coding. Coding 4 hours. After that run the script for 1 hour. Project finished. I didn't get bonus.. :)
The fact that the farmers in this situation are investing in the bean futures definitely seemed joke-y to me. 
It depends how you installed it in the first place and which OS you use. If you are on Windows, you probably don't need to do anything extra, just execute the file you downloaded. Do not manually download files and directories, that probably isn't a good idea.
 def get_factors(dividend): """Return a list of all factors of the given number.""" return [ n for n in range(1, dividend+1) if dividend % n == 0 ] I don't get it. Isnt the idea of list comprehension that we can have code in ONE line? Personally a for loop would make much more sense in this example. Change my mind please.
you could significantly improve the readabilty and efficiency of your code heads = 0 for \_ in range(num\_bets): heads += random.randint(0, 1) total = 200 \* heads - ((num\_bets - heads) \* 100) &amp;#x200B;
Importing just the columns you need and specifying (in the pandas.read\_csv call) which columns you want can also speed things up. So does using dask to do the read and converting to pandas df afterwards.

Flask, learn by playing!
I swear that's the best thing about Anaconda. If only I could optionally turn off it's managing of packages to make sure that things are compatible like pip...no no, trust me they are.
&gt;if that would bring Guido back though. :/ Guido is back. He was voted in as one of the 8 (probably off on that number).
I expect the same thing is technically possible on iOS, but I don't know of any build tools specifically supporting it.
I agree with you, it look pretty bad. Like Lisp syntax in Python program. But authors other points are much better.
BeeWare project founder here. First off - the project name is BeeWare - pybee.org is just the domain (because getting a unique domain name, Twitter and Github handle is almost impossible). Second - BeeWare is very much "early proof of concept". What it does, it does well - but there's a lot it doesn't do, and the documentation isn't anywhere near as good as it could be. Some platforms are more mature than others - macOS and iOS, for example, are reasonably stable, although not feature complete as far as widgets and services are concerned. Others - most notably Windows and Android... are not :-) However, one of the major differences between Kivy and BeeWare is that the pieces are layered. If you want to write a Kivy app - you have to write a Kivy app. You use the Kivy APIs, or nothing. BeeWare is layered. You can use Briefcase to package your code for deployment, and not use any other BeeWare tool. You can use the support libraries to write a native Python app for a mobile platform, but not use BeeWare's GUI toolkit, Toga. Or, you can use the whole stack. The other major difference between BeeWare and Kivy is the approach to GUI interfaces. A BeeWare App *is* a native application - you get native buttons, native inputs, native keyboards, native navigation elements, and son on. An application always looks and feels like a native app, and inherits all the native platform's capabilities (like accessibility). Kivy apps, however, look like Kivy - they use their own widgets. Whether that works for your application is a decision for you to make.
TypeScript thankfully does not have the horrible implicit casting issues JavaScript does. In TypeScript, `1 == "1"` isn't true. It's a compilation error.
I'm with pweipwei on this one. If you're going to space out a list comprehension then why not just write a for loop. 
To clarify - I started developing it *because* of problems I had in the Real World (tm), but haven't used it for anything commercial to date.
Code readability trumps code length every time.
What sort of help do you need? For the actual tSNE implementation I would suggest the sklearn library and for high quality visualization bokeh is an excellent tool.
Well that's awesome! I'm so out of the loop these days I didn't know.
I wont try to change your mind because I definitely agree with you. I will say that this version is more readable than the one-lined version
I apologize for being blunt but this isn't appropriate content imo. The code is ridiculous and you'd be better posting it in r/learnpython for critique. For example, doing things a little more pythonically, removing the print spam and being a little careful about your control flow constructs, your code might have looked like this: &amp;#x200B; `import csv` `import random` `import matplotlib.pyplot as plt` `num_experiments = int(input("Enter the number of times you would like to execute this experiment: "))` `experiment_totals = []` `for _ in range(num_experiments):` `heads = 0` `for _ in range(100):` `heads += random.randint(0, 1)` `experiment_totals.append(heads*200 - (100 * (100-heads)))` `with open("Coin Toss.csv", "w") as csv_file:` `writer = csv.writer(csv_file)` `writer.writerow(["Experiment", "Total Money"])` `for row, amount in enumerate(experiment_totals):` `writer.writerow([row, amount])` `plt.bar(list(range(1, num_experiments + 1)), experiment_totals)` `plt.ylabel("Total Money")` `plt.xlabel("Instance of Experiment")` `plt.show()` 
Why don't you deploy the Flask app to AWS lambda using Zappa? https://www.zappa.io. combined with Aurora serverless, it would be basically free at low volume and infinately scalable. 
Thanks for the bokeh tip. I’ve read about sklearn, but I’m not sure how to properly use it as I’m pretty new to python. Also it would be nice if i could display nodes as pictures/color them, label them etc in a nice manner and if the graph were in 3D (optional maybe) at the current state the data is hard to grasp for me so I don’t even really know what I have to do with it. Possibilities to compare different datasets would be great too. For me it’s just important to retrieve useful information on whatever is hidden in the data And as im New, sone tutorial oder demo program/ code i could copy would be really great so I know how it’s done I saw stuff about hand written numbers and other picture things but I could not really correlate. Im not even sure if the results would be better than with gephi so some further insight would be great too. I just stumbled across it today 
This is so badly organized the best I can comment is to refactor and let you compare and contrast: [https://pastebin.com/Huc6AuFB](https://pastebin.com/Huc6AuFB)
What sort of data are you analyzing? tSNE is not a common tool and is usually reserved for exploratory analysis after more standard methods have been applied. The only structure tSNE is capable of exposing is “relative closeness.” Globally, the distribution of points will show no valuable structure other than local neighborhoods which are close together in the high dimensional space. You should also note that the plot will look different each time it is generated because tSNE is a manifold learning technique which uses a convex optimization function (there is no single optimal solution for a given distribution). If you still think tSNE is the right tool for the job I could direct you to some simple examples, but more than likely I think you would benefit from a dimensional reduction technique which can be rigorously analyzed and inverted such as PCA. 
So ur telling it’s just doing a varianz analysis? 
Mesh using openvpn? How does that work? I thought openvpn supports only client-server model so every traffic between clients would still be routed through the server 
Fluent Python by Ramalho is thrown around here a lot but really is a good book. (Should be noted it mostly covers Python 3-3.4 and some 3.5 iirc.)
Automated myself out of a job. I was an assistant systems admin, and wrote a series of scripts, in Python, BASH, and Perl in order to reduce/eliminate my workload. I did it too well, and management decided that if what I was doing could be automated, then I wasn't needed. I was fired the same day that my supervisor noticed what I was doing. They also were successful in getting my unemployment denied, because "I wouldn't do the work I was assigned." Needless to say, they weren't fun to work for.
I like to do this. I always narrate code in my head and this way it reads like I'm describing an object rather than giving someone directions. Then again, I don't deny that I'm a fool.

OP, I hope you don’t feel discouraged keep learning after comments like this. You’ll find rude people everywhere, so just don’t mind them. Your code is not ridiculous. It’s fascinating how programming as a tool allows us to realize experiments and check the claims by ourselves. I’d suggest you try plotting a histogram to have a sense of the distribution.
tSNE finds a lower dimensional embedding of a higher dimensional space such that the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the two distributions is minimized. This is a manifold learning technique which is much more sophisticated and not much related to analysis of variance.
Efficiency and speed if you loop a lot of stuff. More noticeable in Cython and pypy. list = [] for I in range (100): list.append("something") Define a list, lazily generate range if using python3, make a value, go back and add to lib... list = ["something" for I in range (100)] Dynamically add values as range progresses. Let's do Lego thinking because that's the more interesting way to explain it... The first, you look at the blueprint, make a part, look over all the parts you've made previously, then put the current part on the previous. The second, build a part and put all parts together as you look over the booklet. The first references previous data, the second just mashes in together without regard to the previous state. A very slight optimization. Guides I've read have referred to it as being "pythonic".

I’ve heard django with docker is pretty straightforward 
On the speed and efficiency point, if those are your main concerns, then I am not sure that Python is the right language for that job. Are you saying that List Comprehensions and adjacent For Loops are doing something differently under-the-hood, but providing the same result? Ultimately, I believe the biggest draw for Python is readability; if you are trying to massage something to become readable by rewriting its common usage when there's a perfectly good alternative, then we've all missed the point. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
I have python use twilio’s api to call a telephone number, record the announcement and get the transcription. It then looks through the transcription text looking for key words and phrases. Depending on the confidence of what it finds, it may decide to correlate it with other definitive data to get a more accurate “picture” of what is going on. It then makes a decision on what process to spawn next. Another cool script I wrote, logs onto a scada system’s website using selenium, navigates around, scraping certain data points from different sections. It stores the data in MySQL and the data is displayed to a noc (network operations center) using grafana. I had to do this work around because the vendor wouldn’t allow access to the raw data they were collecting and the scada sensors are in limited access vlan. 
Capturing the fraction of a penny on each transaction?
That's a horrible system. That information should be inside the wheel itself.
The switches may be able to send snmp traps. Make python a snmp receiver. When it receives a trap then have the script do its mojo. That way you will get the alerts immediately. 
&gt;It’s crazy how business run some of these processes with independent systems. I'd really rather we didn't, haha, but it's kind of a strange situation because the company has been around a while but has only recently upped its tech game so there's a lot of disparate systems to wrangle together. &gt;May I PM you? Absolutely :)
Law of Large Numbers wins again
&gt; If there are solutions to these 2 drawbacks, why do people still assume that all is lost? Those are not solutions, only incomplete workarounds. Python has a range of async tools and a vast majority of existing code doesn't work with any of them. You'll get a very castrated version of Python if you try to use async. It's fine for many usecases, but it's not "the Python" most people know, so that's not a solution. Cython is even worse here - you'll get something not only very far away from known Python, but also utterly terrible to use (async Python is at least not bad on its own if you don't need much from ecosystem). If you try to combine those two, you probably find yourself in very exclusive club of 5 people in the world who do that. Not that you can't, but it's rare. Meanwhile other languages don't have those problems and the amount of code you can use without isolating yourself is growing, so I think it's fair to say the cause is lost. If I need high performance today, pure Python is out, there are better languages for that. If I need moderate performance and async, same thing. Where does it leave Python? It still is great languages for experimenting, teaching, prototyping and exploring. If you are building first version of your product, go for it, it will get you very far. If you are building second one, it becomes a burden.
I write bots for grindy f2p games to grind out daily tasks.
That's actually super useful and super practical and something I'd never think to write.
I just posted my alternative to docopt. It's designed to call functions from the command as easily as possible @cli def dir(files : "[path]", size = True, recursive = False): """ Lists all matching files :param files: Files :param size: Display file size :param recursive: Process files recursively :return: None """ for file in files: if size: print(file, os.path.getsize(file)) else: print(file) 
This is cool, a coin toss is a bernouilli process, so you can use the numpy binomial function to quickly sample 100 sets of 100 coin tosses. &gt;&gt;&gt; x = np.random.binomial(100, 0.5, 100) array([49, 48, 44, 45, 47, ... , 52, 52]) Then multiply by 200 to get the wins and subtract 100 for each of the losses. If your original array is x then balances = (200 * x) - ((100 - x) * 100) = (300 * x) - 10_000 You can do it in one line! 300 * np.random.binomial(100, 0.5, 100) - 10_000 If you look into using distributions to rapidly sample probabilistic events you will find loads of cool stuff, especially check out Jake Vanderplas and his videos, he makes it really simple. Your experiment was a cool example of that, using numpy you can do more and faster.
The low energy range is enough to eliminate Geant as a potential solution. The code was developed for LHC and higher energy range interactions, primarily, so anything below 10's of keV is excluded unless you're an electron. Thanks for the reply.
For me, the main benefit of a list comprehension is that I don't need to create an empty list and I don't need to append the results of my for loop to that list. Being able to write the expression on one line is usually a benefit but not always, and it's better not to write it on one line if it's too long. That said, I agree you can overdo list comprehensions. If your condition is more complex than one if-statement, or you have to transform the output significantly before adding it to a new list, then it's probably better to be in a proper for loop.
Doctors in my clinic have to manually evaluate .tsv files (think crappy Excel sheets) filled with genomic mutations on cancer patients who we are running tests on, and then write up reports for each patient describing the medical significance of the mutations to send back to the patient's doctor for them to make a diagnosis on treatment. &amp;#x200B; Problem is, for a given mutation, they always use the exact same paragraph of text describing the mutation, so they end up having to look them up in a giant MS Word document or another Excel sheet and copy/paste tons of text together to make the report. Additionally, there are public databases online that offer some of these kinds of interpretation descriptions which they like to use, but still have to manually look up the description of each mutation one-by-one. Its a very tedious process for them, takes upwards of 20-30min+ per patient and they have dozens of patients a week. &amp;#x200B; So I took the public database they wanted, along with a starter set of their own custom interpretations, put it all in a SQLite database, hooked it into a Django app, and deployed it on a web server so now they have a web app where they can upload their .tsv file and it tries its best to match their patient's mutations with whatever entries it can find in the database, and even prepares for them a small template text snippet that they can copy/paste directly into EPIC to start out the report. The doctors seem to love it. The code is here: [https://github.com/NYU-Molecular-Pathology/IR-interpreter](https://github.com/NYU-Molecular-Pathology/IR-interpreter)
You have to generate a site to site vpn for every pair of cities, so you need to make n\*(n-1) number of config files. Openvpn is the wrong tool for the job really but I wanted to use it.

What do you mean by confidence, and how do you measure it?
I logged into 300 routers and checked the fabric of each router....and if there was an error it would send a syslog on which router it is and which part of the fabric was failing.
You can also model the whole thing with the binomial distribution. Total = 300*Binomial(n, p) -100n with n=100 and p=0.5
I am trying to implement Celery in my Django apps. So far, I have gotten it installed in conda, along with RabbitMQ; that along was a massive headache, RabbitMQ in conda has some messed up dependency issues that took 2 hours to debug. But anway, now after more hours of perusing the Celery docs and setting things up, I have my test demo tasks, but when I try to run them, they... dont work. Either they block the whole Django server and stall everything, or they run but nothing makes its way back to the server. Very confusing, the docs are pretty horrendous, extremely scatter-brained, feels like an uphill battle. Eventually, I want to have some user-initiated long-running background tasks, and some automated backups of the Django databases every time someone creates a new entry (which is not often for this app).
Use Exiftool: [https://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/\~phil/exiftool/](https://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/) its not a Python module but its so versatile that you might as well use it anyway
A day or two, i think?
For my personal project for uni I need to implement a way for a webcam to detect gestures.... then perform an outcome such as changing volume or screen brightness. Haven’t even started and got a month left😂😭😂
Pyenv isn't on PyPI, is it? &amp;#x200B; [https://pypi.org/project/pyenv/](https://pypi.org/project/pyenv/)
&gt;you have to transform the output significantly before adding it to a new list in a Stack Overflow post I read the other day, someone pointed out the painfully obvious but overlooked method of simply creating a function; ``` def capitalize_some(string) : if not string.isupper(): return(string.title()) else: return(string) capital_strings = [ capitalize_some(x) for x in list_of_strings ] ```
I think you want DevDocs; https://devdocs.io/ It lets you store the docs for various programming languages and libraries in your browser's offline cache
Thanks a lot! I’m actually learning Django so this really comes in handy
I like the readability of this, but obviously your example would not be indicative of how it would be used in practice. My only digress with this is that we are still creating additional code to make something that is natively less readable (list comprehension) more readable when there's a perfectly good way to handle it (for-loop). This would also be assuming that you are creating a function specifically to generate a list.
Our office uses a custom program to display stock &amp; sales info from our erp before downloading as an exel file. I made a Python script with pyautogui that opens the program, fills in filters and exports the data to an excel file and saved it as an exe file using pyinstaller. A second python script uses pandas to open said excel file and massages &amp; generates 10 or so reports and saves them in one of our shared folders. A have my PC set up so it wakes every morning and runs these two scripts automatically so we have these reports generated for us every morning. The cool thing with using pyinstaller is that you can share your exe file with your nontech savvy coworkers and they can run it, so long as the paths you set in the script are the same.

Thanks. This got me thinking. I’d like to ramp it up on a cloud and see how extreme you could get. Apparently the python random number generator is pretty solid. 
it depends on the context; in this case, I actually needed to use feature for the same purpose in many places, so it ended up being easier to just make it a function anyway. `for/if/elif/if`loops are only slightly easier to read than the same in a list comp, IMO
Nice. 
I was going to comment but just made a separate post for it here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/b5y796/demo\_web\_app\_deployment\_with\_django\_gunicorn\_and/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/b5y796/demo_web_app_deployment_with_django_gunicorn_and/)
Just use Atom + terminal. There is no need for an IDE for Python. 
I’m a fellow python novice, but you could make your code slightly cleaner with the range() function I think. Instead of while, just for i in range(100), it automatically iterates through the function and you only need to use i+1 if you want nicer print outs. But you don’t need to do +1 bc in computer science index 0 is the actual first spot of any list/range not 1. Regardless, good job on being committed and taking on that first project
Install Linux and use Atom + terminal. 
Super easy to use.
I break out the \`logging\` module when I have a rather large app that has many modules and I need fine-grained control over logs that eventually need to be preserved, moreso than a script that prints to console then I dont care anymore. &amp;#x200B; If I am going to have a file log, then there is only one. Unless I really really really have a good reason for multiple log files, then maybe I could consider having a separate file for certain loggers, and the loggers are typically divided up based on their module of use. So like the logger for the web app might be separate from the logger that runs the custom database matching. But in practice I just put it all in the same file. &amp;#x200B; However, this does not sound like what you are describing here: &amp;#x200B; \&gt; to record all of the automated tasks I have scheduled with python, as well as have an active history of all python coding endeavors, similar to a bash history. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; Logging in Python is something you use for your programs to output messages that can be captured and handled in specific manners. It sounds more like you need a GitHub/Bitbucket account. 
why would you want the headache of setting up and interacting with a database when you could just read a text file? 
actually I use a custom shell command called \`now\` to keep a diary-like log of my activities while I am working on projects: [https://github.com/stevekm/now-log](https://github.com/stevekm/now-log) Since I do all my projects in separate directories, I am able to tell what project I was working on for any given log message. Since I have to bill for my time spent on projects at work, I use the timestamps from these log messages in order to get a rough estimate of the hours spent on each project, assuming I was diligent in making a note of each time I started work on a new project during the day. 
I second using Jinja if possiple. But honestly, when I am doing stuff like this, if its only a small number of edits that I need to make repeatedly, I just use `sed`. Keep a template version saved, then `cat my_template.txt | sed -e 's|old_pattern|new_pattern|g' &gt; final_file.txt`
Album cover grabber. Looks at meta data, does an API call to get album cover link, downloads it as folder.jpg. it goes through your entire library and can handle nested folders(library/artist/album/CD)
&gt; Should I aim to make the code that short? No. &gt; Or should you always look for a sweet spot between readability and shortness? Yes. And these sort of posts belong in /r/learnpython, according to the sidebar.
This is the real answer. conda is vastly superior to pip, because it approaches levels of usage that make it almost a Docker replacement. I can use a few lines of code to install an entire complex software stack, in the current directory, without admin rights on the system. This is HUGE. I use conda extensively for this purpose, it allows me to seamlessly transition between my desktop iMac at work, to my remote CentOS and RHEL servers, to my MacBook at home, with the exact same code repo, all I have to do is run a few `conda install` commands. Also, conda and pip are not mutually exclusive. I typically wrap the whole thing up in a Makefile like this one, which allows it to automatically adjust to Linux or macOS installations: ``` SHELL:=/bin/bash UNAME:=$(shell uname) # install app install: conda-install init # ~~~~~ Setup Conda ~~~~~ # # this sets the system PATH to ensure we are using in included 'conda' installation for all software PATH:=$(CURDIR)/conda/bin:$(PATH) unexport PYTHONPATH unexport PYTHONHOME # install versions of conda for Mac or Linux ifeq ($(UNAME), Darwin) CONDASH:=Miniconda3-4.5.4-MacOSX-x86_64.sh endif ifeq ($(UNAME), Linux) CONDASH:=Miniconda3-4.5.4-Linux-x86_64.sh endif CONDAURL:=https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/$(CONDASH) # install conda conda: @echo "&gt;&gt;&gt; Setting up conda..." @wget "$(CONDAURL)" &amp;&amp; \ bash "$(CONDASH)" -b -p conda &amp;&amp; \ rm -f "$(CONDASH)" # install the conda and python packages required # NOTE: **MUST** install ncurses from conda-forge for RabbitMQ to work!! conda-install: conda conda install -y conda-forge::ncurses &amp;&amp; \ conda install -y -c anaconda -c bioconda \ django=2.1.5 \ nextflow=19.01.0 \ celery=4.2.1 \ rabbitmq-server=3.7.13 &amp;&amp; \ pip install \ django-celery-results==1.0.4 \ django-celery-beat==1.4.0 ``` Put this in a Makefile in your repo, and all you have to do is run `make conda-install` and all your repo dependencies are resolved for you, completely independent of every other project you are working on as well. Its magical. 
If you document it well, it doesn't really matter. You don't have to make it super short, but something super short that "just works" will be a better read than something long. I'd personally use the short version because it increases readability. Just comment it well.
/r/learnpython 
wow! This is mind blowing . Keep it up dude
Looks like there is a version available for Windows on conda: https://anaconda.org/jonrowland/twilio
Why do you need a certification? For Python, that is meaningless and largely worthless. You show that you know how to use Python by showing Python code and projects you have made. Put your projects on GitHub. As for courses, I got started with the 100% free Coursera class on Python
That is fairly readable to be honest. But yeah you need to find a sweetspot. Don't keep layering on functional tricks ontop of each other, Python isn't too bad for this since lambda expressions are only limited to a single line.

Much helpful.
And when you get there, give them a link to, or copy of the exercises. Not everyone has that text on their shelf and absolutely no one cares about your problems enough to track it down. 
I was on a project of a vending machine that uses 3g, connection sucks so I made a script that monitors all the running components as well as the connection, should it fail it restarts the programs and it reconnects the machine. It also generates the name for all machines.
Not of the programs I write deal much with async or are bothered by the GIL. The **real** reasons NOT to use Python are: - you do not want people to have access to your source code - you need the program to run on a end-user's computer If you are going to build your program in Python, you absolutely MUST be able to provide the .py files associated with it. If you do not feel comfortable doing this because you need to obfuscate or protect your proprietary code, then DONT USE PYTHON. Yes, there are methods to compile your Python into a shippable binary, but now you have to pull in the overhead of compiling tools, and run the risk of screwing up the binary and shipping a program that does not work for the end user because of some dependency you forgot to include aka "But It Works For Me!" And, the install process for Python, especially on a Windows machine, is horrendous. Even with things like pip and conda, it is way way too much to ask for the end-user to screw with package management just to get your program working. You cannot double-click a .exe file and run your Python program, not without a lot of help (see above), its just not worth the pain that you are going to put yourself and your users through. So, in light of this, Python works great in situations where the code only has to run on machines that YOU control, and the end-user does not have to see the code to get value from your program. Essentially, server-side and back-end types of situations. 
Thanks, I wasn't aware of that. I had to write a blog post, and thought a super easy to use command line decorator would be cool.
thanks! i’m gonna try it out sometime soon

Here is the Github for anyone interested in the code : [https://github.com/Fire-SP/Fluid-Sim](https://github.com/Fire-SP/Fluid-Sim) 
I wrote a script using (mostly) pexpect and pyserial to automate the process of configuring network switches that we send off to customers. It prompts the user to enter a MAC address and serial number, issues a series of commands, grabs firmware from a TFTP server, uploads firmware, and then routes AVB audio data through the switch as a final test. It’s a huge time saver for the people who had to program the switches (and no longer a huge pain in the ass)

There's not *much* of an advantage to be sure; you basically just don't have to maintain logic in various scripts, plus you get logic for sequential and concurrent lists for free. But ain't nobody giving me a Turing award for it.
In normal python it doesn't really matter, most projects can live without the optimizations. If you run it through Cython it would be multiples. The optimization of one of the ways to define something. Like the many ways of printing and concatenating strings. print("this" + str(that)) print("this %s" % that) print("this {}".format(that)) # "pythonic" python(f"this {that}") # joke not intended They should be in fastest order, top being slowest. They are kept for legacy reasons and... Other reasons? Pythonic ones are usually faster, not, my grandpa is a rocket, but like, feels snappier. Python is still good in performance for some apps. I made one recently that runs the same speed even in pseudo C (Cython), the GUI launches faster in C, but other than that, it didn't benefit from optimizations, threading, or multiprocessing... But cases like that are rare, at least I hope so.
pipenv
Ok
Can you explain briefly how you did this? It sounds like an amazing alternative
Another option if you want to do this in Python but without another dependency is string formatting functions, which serve basic template functionality. However since `format()` uses the curly braces you will need to escape the others in your file, so it would look like this: provider "aws" {{ version = "~&gt; "{PROVIDER_VERSION}" region = "{REGION}" assume_role {{ role_arn = "{ROLE_ARN}" }} }} Then the code would look like this: variables = { "PROVIDER_VERSION": "my provider", "REGION": "my region", "ROLE_ARN": "my role", } with open(template_file, "r") as f: template = f.read() output = template.format(**variables) with open(target_file, "w") as f: f.write(output) We're unpacking the dictionary of settings/variables so the keys would need to match the names in your file (or you could list them as keyword arguments if they are all valid variable names). Also since this isn't finding and replacing I would keep the template and the output separate. Here's the [Format String Syntax documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#format-string-syntax) for more details on what you can do.

They're called list comprehensions, and they're really just shorthand. &amp;#x200B; &gt;&gt;&gt; t = [i for i in range(10)] &gt;&gt;&gt; print(t) [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] &gt;&gt;&gt; # same as ... t = [] &gt;&gt;&gt; for i in range(10): ... t.append(i) ... &gt;&gt;&gt; print(t) [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] &amp;#x200B; The difference is that the list comprehension is actually quite a bit faster because of internal optimizations that you won't get when using a list append operation (list operations are, in general, quite expensive - particularly splicing). &amp;#x200B; I am a functional head, so I tend to think of problems in that way and just write them out as I think about them. I have spent a lot of time writing various lisps (especially Clojure).
As I keep explaining, I called for a palace coup in this subreddit, and three days later Guido "resigned". For some reason people refuse to give due credit to my skullduggery.

While he has not formally accepted my invitation, he has not declined so far either.

There is no direct equivalent to **cargo**, though you’ll find: 1. **poetry** has some overlap for package management and distribution when making libraries... it’s notably less well-rounded for applications. 2. **pipenv** has similar overlap when making applications, with similar caveats for libraries. 3. **pylint** provides some of the same functionality as `cargo clippy`. 4. **yapf** and **black** provide similar functionality to `cargo fmt`. 5. **pytest** overlaps with `cargo test`.

You've mentioned ASCIICodecBot! Here are your options for using my services: "u/asciicodecbot info": Display list of functions offered.

I don’t get why this is downvoted. Pythonic and clean solution. 
don't be an ass
It’d be for the situation when you want to do a lot of analysis on the file contents afterwards. SQL sure makes that aspect easy and powerful. But if the data is just “I’ll log it and stick it in a file so I know it’s available if I ever do need to manually investigate something later” then yes, the database is likely overkill. 
Thanks for the explanation. Very helpful. 
Good work on your project, the distribution does seem pretty random, would like to suggest that instead of importing the whole random module? You can just import the part you are using? like "from random import randint" instead of "import random" this should improve your loading times.

Pretty good code! The most important thing is that it achieves what you're trying to do. There are plenty of successful products out there underpinned by shitty code, and also plenty of projects that failed because coding standards and quality was valued over functionality. So first things first, code should work. I think you made good use of python libraries and functionality. You'd be surprised how many people write their own CSV parsing/writing code only to eventually find out that `csv` exists. Using the `count` function of the array is also nice. I take some issue with those who suggest you use with `with` statement for the csv file. I say this because the way you're using it means you'd have to partially rewrite your code to do that (i.e. store all the values in an array and then write to the csv in one big dump all at the end), which has its benefits, but most of the commenters aren't taking that into account. If you want to write better code, there's a million and one resources out there, I'm sure you'll find them should you seek them. Personally, I'd recommend investigating the concept of pure functions. I think they really supercharge one's code, and I've managed to convince a few people at SpaceX and elsewhere of this :) Now if only I could find the time to read that book, it's been on my list for some time...
This is not really the Downsides of Python because we can easily overcome this in Python. As you already mentioned that By using the library IO Asynico we can overcome the limitation of Lack of Asynchronous nature. And the second Downside about GIL is not an issue. GIL is used in Python inorder to prevent multiple thread from executing the Python Bytecodes. It is used in Python because Cpython memory management is not thread safe. Actually there are numbers of advantages which python provides but not other programming language and that is the reason why Python is used in almost all the projects or Company. Nowadays the [Concept of Python](http://pythonandmltrainingcourses.com/courses/best-diploma-in-python-course-in-delhi/) became very important as most of the applications like Agriculture, Data Science,Data Analysis, Data Management. &amp;#x200B;
In case anyone is interested I did some "maths" on this stuff. Mostly because the question of the "odds" bothered me like a bear riding a pickle. So here is a [graph of odds of losing](https://imgur.com/NhNXXTG). I've defined "losing" as not getting any money (breaking even) or losing money. And for this I'm using Tails as a lose. So with one coin flip it is obvious a 50% chance. With two flips you have a 25% chance of losing--you only lose with TT out of HH, HT, TH, -TT. Strangely, with 3 flips you're back to a 50% chance--again it takes two Tails but it happens in 1/2 the cases (HHH, HHT, HTH, -HTT, THH, -THT, -TTH, -TTT). However, you're actually breaking even for all cases except TTT. Treating $0 won as a loss was arbitrary but it is the route I chose. Anyway, it turns out for the $200 for Heads and -$100 for Tails simply by using floor division by 3 on the number of flips and subtracting that from the number of flips. So in python `flips - flips // 3`. Someone who is better at math or this sort of problem would need to explain why this is the case--I found it by brute force until I found a pattern. So . . . if flips = 100 you end up needing `100 - 100 // 3` Tails to lose money. That turns out to be 67 Tails. Quick math to check that 33 Heads * 200 - 67 Tails * 100--&gt; -$100. Seems insane to me but the chance of getting 67 or more Tails is 0.04368599% (or the 1/2,300 mentioned). So, how do you actually get that number. You have to use [the binomial distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_distribution). But that will only tell you the probability of getting 67 Tails out of 100. So you also have to figure out 68 out of 100, 69 out . . . and add them all together. Just a quick example for the code below for the 67/100 case we'd have N = 100, K = 67 and p = 0.5 (Heads/Tails). And the general formula is . . . Binomial Coefficient * "odds of tails" * "odds of heads". Where Binomial Coefficient is `N! / (K! * (N - K)!)`. "odds of tails" and "odds of heads" are simply p^#Tails and p^#Heads. So for the chances of losing in a 100 flips we have 100! / (67! * (100 - 67)!) * 0.5^67 * 0.5^33 + 100! / (68! * (100 - 68)!) * 0.5^68 * 0.5^32 + ... 100! / (100! * (100 - 100)!) * 0.5^100 * 0.5^0 = 0.0004368599 Anyway the code to get the graph (was done in jupyter hence the first line)--and you can just print the y_axis list if you just want raw numbers . . . %matplotlib inline import matplotlib.pyplot as plt start = 1 end = 101 x_axis = [x for x in range(start, end)] y_axis = [] for flips in range(start, end): N = flips K = flips - (flips // 3) odds = 0 while (K &lt;= N): odds += (math.factorial(N) / (math.factorial(K) * math.factorial(N - K))) * (0.5 ** K * 0.5 ** (N - K)) K += 1 y_axis.append(odds) plt.rcParams['figure.figsize'] = [12, 10] plt.plot(x_axis, y_axis) plt.ylabel('Odds of breaking even or losing') plt.xlabel('Flips') plt.grid() plt.show() Amazing what a few lines of python can do.

Not sure why your getting down voted, but this is a very true fact. Companies will easily take your work and use it to replace you and never update the script. Seen it time and time again. It's a shitty thing for a company to do. 
I wrote a script that takes random flickr image, converts it to an abstract art with deep ai, then it takes a random quote from a random book and posts everything on instagram through buffer.com. 
Probably because they didn't want to hear the truth.

If only... from rust import cargo from __future__ import better_packaging but alas. 
&gt; That is, what's the PEP-sanctioned way of including in the source code "this program requires features in 3.8 or later". If you're distributing your code in packaged form, the official way is to use the `python_requires` specifier in the package's `setup.py`. When you do that, `pip` will not install the package onto an incompatible version of Python. For example, if you know (say, because you use the `:=` operator) that your code requires at least Python 3.8, you could do: setup( # other arguments python_requires='&gt;=3.8' ) and you're done. Using the trove classifiers as the other reply suggests won't do this; the trove classifiers are only for the searching and filtering interface on PyPI, not for `pip`. If you aren't packaging code for distribution but you still want to write code that's guaranteed to break as quickly as possible on a Python version you don't support, [I've also written a guide to that](https://www.b-list.org/weblog/2016/nov/28/break-python/).
status_code is what you're after. r = requests.get(url) print(r.status_code)
Suggestions for continued learning: 1) use select()/Popen.communicate() to get the output of the execution and parse it. Both are really powerful and fun things to know and I think you could do it in no time! Parsing the output should be pretty easy as IIRC youtube-dl has json output mode. Good opportunity to learn about async processing and how STDIN/OUT work. 2) Add a quality selection modal dialog. When you run youtube-dl -F &lt;url&gt; it gives you a list of formats to choose to download. Just some quick things that you could use to learn more. I REALLY like the tk interface in python, but you never hear people talk about it much. I have like 50 personal tools that I use that i wrote using it (mostly status display stuff). Keep up the good work and have fun.

Python --version
Your solution is a tad verbose, due not taking advantage of python idioms. Do not loop over lists with `range(len())` (check Raymond Hettinger's "idiomatic pythonic" talk). Use `str.join()` to build the resulting chained string. I also do not think using `names[i+1]` subscript is a good habit, even if you try to catch the last index in the first if block, seems a bad habit to have in future. Personally I do not like that short version, the reverse/replace-first/reverse-again "trick" to replace last occurrence is not very readable when inline ``` def namelist(names): names = [n['name'] for n in names] head = ', '.join(names[:-1]) tail = names[-1] return f"{head} &amp; {tail}" ``` Non-python related, notice how you are checking if a name is the last name by comparing the strings rather than the position like it'd be logical (you want "the last one" after all). What happens when your input dict becomes `{'name': 'Maggie'}, {'name': 'Lisa'}, {'name': 'Maggie'}`?
Are you sure this answer my question about mutual compatibility of packages and python?

Thank you so much for your feedback. That is what is frustrating me the most. When I see code, I immediately know what it can do, and I understand it, but coming up with "clean" solutions sometimes evades me, and then I just implement whatever comes to my head and I make it work, maybe cause I'm older, and then when I see the solutions by others, it makes me die a little inside.
I wrote a post explaining the uses of the \`in\` keyword and how to use make use of it in your own code. I'm new to blogging, so please bring on the feedback!
Or you can just do print(eval(input()))

How about no? I would run away from such interview. Implementing algorithms? What about real problems? Check this out https://hackattic.com/
I agree with the sentiment, I hate these types of questions too as they give little insight into a candidates actual programming skills. However, for many of us junior devs, it is something we have to put up with.
Oh okay, right now I just calculate the variance of each different part with another, to compare the difference, If they are equal, the result is 1 (after conversion) and that means strong attraction. If they are very different it’s normalized to 0 and there’s no attraction between the parts. Then a Cluster layout is created with a that simulates the attraction weights as springs and clusters form That’s what i meant by variance analysis. The clusters should be in both algorithms the same, or not?

You're lying. I don't want to believe in this. I feel worse than PHP.
&gt; You could write a Makefile, but they’re annoying. I don’t understand why you say they’re annoying. Make has the distinct advantages of being heavily battle tested like few other programs are and being available on just about every platform you could name. Both are huge advantages and any tool wanting to replace Make better bring something amazing to the table.
Eh, really depends on where you live. Pretty much unavoidable in the SF Bay area for normal SWE roles.

I am half human half reddit bot, and my half-bot self is written in python.
Hi everybody, how about this one? [github.com/FoteinosMerg/pymerkle](https://github.com/FoteinosMerg/pymerkle) It isn't compatible with python 2 but has some cool features (including support for different encoding types and hash functions). The tree-structure is different, I don't really understand why this is a big deal but seems to be security-related.
Eh, I get asked weird bullshit as a senior too, but the better interviewers take it way less seriously and are more interested in how you approach the problem and want to hear you work through it. It's partially double checking that, yes, you do know python and didn't lie all over your resume. However, I have seen plenty of interviewers ask a question about a problem where they're looking for one solution they think is clever and get upset if you don't get it or get worse big Oh than their solution... I've seen that from the interviewer and interviewee side and it really drives me nuts. I had one interview that I walked out on in the middle because they told me absolutely nothing about the job except it's software engineering and "they'd find a place where I fit", and the first two hours was barely more than juniors asking me to solve toy problems. Being able to code solutions to "academically neat" problems on the spot is useful for pretty much 90% of interviews. Not everyone will fail you if you miss it... but I guarantee they'll be more excited about the people that look smart on the spot and have no problem doing it.
It produces a cleaner look in console. 
Of course man I'm saving them to a txt file for God sake 😂😂😂

IIRC in one of the dramas he had, his family got threatened. I completely get why he'd go "fuck it, I'm out", because it happened to me too in another community.
The bad rep has nothing to do with speed, and everything with security and correctness. The problem with pickle is that it is, by design, a code execution vulnerability: it is not a data serialization format, but a code serialization format. Which means that crafting a pickle file that will run arbitrary code in the context of the application that loads it, the moment it loads it, is absolutely trivial. And there is no way to defend against that, other than treat your pickle files the same way you would treat your code: keep them in source control, install them along with the code, make them read-only to the consuming process, keep them in a location separate from writeable application data. But if you're going to do that, you can't actually use them for what they were intended for (serializing application state to read it back in later), because **you cannot write them from within your application**. Pickles are, for all practical intents and purposes, Python code, so you might as well just write Python and skip the pickling. In short, with pickle, the choice is between "reasonably secure" and "useful". You can't have both.
Mate, put four spaces at the beginning of each line of code so it looks like this: import requests Makes everything more legible. 
Thanks man for the answer. My output from print command it is with empty lines and the names are not starting from the beginning of the line.
Hey, you never know ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ but I'll be damned if that comment didn't just make my day 😂
Soon
Pickle is and has always been extremely efficient, but it isn't a data interchange format or something to handle untrusted input. It's basically like dumping part of your live python program to disk so you can load it again later - useful for things like caching or sending information between python processes, plus you will always get out of your pickle exactly what you put in it, including complex classes/data structures, function objects, etc. Just don't use it in any situation where security/trust is an issue.
Worse, I had to take an eskills.com test
Ah, sorry I missed this two weeks ago! This is extremely cool, and I'm not sure how I missed this before.
What are you particularly having problems with? I'm really new to programming in general. But use Pycharm because I actually find it easier to use than doing CMD and all this over stuff. I don't know all the ins and outs of PyCharm, and haven't really even touched the settings beyond the interpreter for installing libraries. However I might be able to help :) 
Repl.it is good
Make doesn't exactly use shell lines, though it looks like it. Things like wildcards require you to remember make functions syntax. I also don't know that's there's an easy way to do something like have a sequential list of tasks run as one of several concurrent tasks. 
I'm new to programming too, learning it in college. Try to find a place to learn syntax, anywhere is fine. A YouTube video, or codeacademy. Then, go to a place like codewars or one of the websites with "coding challenges" if you can't do one just skip and go to the next one. 
Yo isn't a Make replacement; it replaces something you can force Make to do, but that it wasn't really intended for. Make is obviously superior for, say, build systems and even data science projects. Yo, for me, fits better for very small projects like latex documents and for something like what developments, where the Make concept of a made file might not be as apt.
I haven't looked at all of them yet, but why is remove_duplicates written like that? First of all it has the side effect of adding 0s to the original array. It also fails if there are any 0's in the original array. So like, test_arr = [0,0,0,1,1,2,2,3,4,5] result = remove_duplicates(test_arr) print(result) # [1,2,3,4,5] print(test_arr) # [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 3, 4, 5] Also, wouldn't a set be more useful than a dict with a fixed value? Finally, if you are going to create a new list anyway using the list comprehension at the end, why not just make a new list and check against the items in it (if you are dealing with lots of items maybe use a set to compare against a set to keep the runtime away from n^2 ). Although if order isn't important, wouldn't the fastest way just be `list(set(arr))`? 
I agree these aren't very good interview problems. But that doesn't mean they aren't good problems to attempt in order to prepare for an interview.
It would really help if each of these problems were described, as well as solved.
Ok nice i will try it out :) 
I highly recommend this book for new programmers who want to learn Python. It's a quick read and full of simple, easy to understand examples. In the end, you'll know the basic programming concepts you need to continue your learning. The Super Simple Book https://www.amazon.com/dp/1718198450
There are some YouTube videos and tutorials online (Just random ones if you google and search on Reddit), that are almost as good if not even better than my college courses. From what I'm getting, it's just diving in is where you learn. Don't be afraid to pick a project way out of your scope either, cause you'll at least learn a little something new on the journey that you can use elsewhere. Also, I might recommend coding little calculators to do your math homework for you. At least the very long and monotonous assignments, or trying to do some sort of automation related to your school work. Then you might be inspired to start coding other parts to help solve problems in your life. Good luck! 
Nice i i will check the videos and other stuff Thanks:) 
We have a series of "lists of machines and owners" all managed by different groups(politics). I grab all of those, parse them out, determine what is production, and add them all to Nagios monitoring. Daily. Keeps everything running smoothly.
Nice article, try to avoid naming variables as builtin functions (i.e: list) as it is considered bad practice and may lead to bugs
Pickle is not meant for permanence. If you drop it to disk and then reload it, it will break as soon as you rename a class. Never use pickle for data storage. Pickle is an internal implementation detail for marshalling. 
I used stdout.read() instead of communicate() because using communicate() outputs to "{blablablaba} None" and stdout.read() doesn't have brackets and "None"
Marshalling is yet another format, different than pickle: [https://docs.python.org/3/library/marshal.html](https://docs.python.org/3/library/marshal.html)
Have you tried loguru? It's a easy as print but with all the versatility of logging
Ah in the __init__() right? Thanks!
&gt; and then I just implement whatever comes to my head and I make it work That's the first feature of software. You can (and likely will have to) make that code better later on. &gt; maybe cause I'm older, and then when I see the solutions by others, it makes me die a little inside. I do not think the age is relevant there. Disclaimer: I am no particularly good myself. I think better code comes with deliberate practice, check the various PyCon talks, those are often great for learning and as reference of "better" code. 
Can anyone tell me if they fixed the call stack not working in the debugger?
Read the docs for pickle. The giant warning on the first page. Do people not read docs anymore?

It would not be faster but equivalent. Because set also use a hash table. But a thing that could be faster is if the list sorted iter the list with a if greater add else pass but it's a waste of time for the Dev.

What I'd actually expect is that each individual call to the iter method would act more like a factory that returns some iterator every time, for example you could replace the entire mechanism you wrote with: def __iter__(self): return iter(self.data) I'd recommend against implementing both the iterable and iterator protocols on your data structure and instead recommend either doing something like the above (just punt off to some built in iterator type) or writing your own iterator for your class (I've done this once it twice when a built in iterator didn't fit the bill). The reason is that most people would expect: x = MyIterator([1, 2, 3]) y = iter(x) print(next(y)) iter(x) print(next(y)) To output 1 and 2, not 1 and 1.
Well, you know how to install libraries, so that is a start. I was instructed to use a turtle command, but then realized I needed to import the module. Is that the same thing?
I started with celery, i have since moved to jenkins, its a bit of a sledgehammer for a nail but it has some much reporting and fall over recovery that celery just doesn't compete
You are a gem. Thank you.
Thank you.
Compared to Jedi, that's an amazing boost. 
I'm working on a simple virtual assistant
No, deployed it to an internal VM server, and I made it very clear to our IT dept. not to make it public-facing. Additionally, I did my best to avoid potential data leakages or anything like that by trying to keep the data from ever hitting disk, it gets read into Pandas straight from memory (I think...), also the contents of the file do not contain any identifiers either, just mutations, so that also helps a bit to keep it more anonymitized. The data itself is generated and stored by other instruments we use so it would actually be easier to just go back to them for any large-scale analytics, the .tsv input file here is a convenience export from that instrument's server. &amp;#x200B; All that said, I did put an older Flask version up on Heroku for demo purposes; code here, Heroku link included: [https://github.com/NYU-Molecular-Pathology/IR-interpreter-flask](https://github.com/NYU-Molecular-Pathology/IR-interpreter-flask) . I abandoned this one for Django once I realized that they wanted to start pulling in more and more databases, and start adding on to the database entries, for which I really needed that Django Admin Panel.
Bots for OSRPG's; Use pywin32 to get everything I need to know about the window, this lets me put input into the window precisely where i want it, even if the window has been moved around. Take screenshots of the last inventory space every 10 seconds\~ or so. Compare it to a saved image of the last inventory slot that is empty, and if that returns false, execute a small ahk function that unloads the inventory, and then starts doing whatever again (fishing, mining, woodcutting, etc.)
I have heard of Jenkins but never knew what it does. For this I am still working in Python though, I need to basically spin off background processes that run in the context of my Django app, it does not sound like it covers this use-case. For example, user clicks a button on the web app which starts running a subprocess on the server, which is then monitored for completion (user-initiated task), meanwhile an API endpoint on the same server is listening for HTTP messages sent out by that subprocess and storing their contents in a database using a task queue, since the messages get sent out very rapidly. 
that sounds really cool, is it on GitHub?
I used pytorch to do Q-learning, and python to build the system that controls the robot and its environment. I did a hefty blog post [about it here](https://www.declanoller.com/2019/03/27/training-a-real-robot-to-play-puckworld-with-reinforcement-learning/), let me know if you have any questions or comments!

It should be instant. You should check your system is working correctly. People say Pycharm is slow, and it is, compared to Sublime, but I've never seen it not be instant.
I'm the PyCharm Developer Advocate. Got any questions about 2019.1? Ask away.
I don't use Pycharm, I use VSCode. Also, it's slow only on Numpy(because it has so many methods with documentations) on other small-average modules, it works completely fine and quick(like 0.2 or 0.3s kind of time)
The point of list comprehensions (as I use them and teach them) is to use a specific tool to convey a specific purpose for your code. When I see this code, I immediately think "looping": ```python def get_factors(dividend): """Return a list of all factors of the given number.""" factors = [] for n in range(1, dividend+1): if dividend % n == 0: factors.append(n) return factors ``` When I see this code, I think "we're constructing a new list from an old iterable": ```python def get_factors(dividend): """Return a list of all factors of the given number.""" return [ n for n in range(1, dividend+1) if dividend % n == 0 ] ``` I talk about this perspective [a little bit here](https://youtu.be/knMg6G9_XCg?t=1262). I tend to use white space very generously with my comprehensions. This is just my perspective, though I do know at least a few others who hold it.
For one I would love to see your code for the learning agent!
What hardware are you using?
That's weird. Does task manager show your resources being used up by something? Have you excluded your project folder from antivirus scanners? Is your computer 20 years old and using magnetic tape drives (/s)? Autocomplete shouldn't take a second, forget about 20. I know that when I've had very slow performance with programming applications it's usually because antivirus developers can't seem to understand they should scan files in parallel with read/writes, not in series. Check to see that isn't the issue.
We've just released Plotly Express, which is a higher-level Plotly wrapper: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/b3doya/introducing\_plotly\_express/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/b3doya/introducing_plotly_express/)?
Why the heck is this piece of software so good? I mean whats wrong with you guys? Cant you make software like everyone else?
Hey, sure! It's a bit messy but [here's the github repo](https://github.com/declanoller/robot_car).
Thank you!!! :)

Thanks, but it brings up an interesting point. Our Jupyter support took longer than expected. We originally planned it for 2018.3. Why? It's...deep stuff. With more deep stuff planned. (Hence the move to Professional.) We might do a blog post on the what/why/how of the new Jupyter support. Think you'd be interested?
I really want to thank you guys for the awesome amount of quality work that you do. I have been using pycharm pro for two years now and its been a great experience. Only one minor issue though, startup time is too slow. It used to start in under 30 secs, but now it takes well over that just for the splash screen.
RAM: 4GB Processor: I3 Intel Core
No, I didn't exclude my project from Antivirus scanner. And the only programs I run anyway are Firefox + VSCode. 
No, people just ask on stackoverflow or reddit so that others solve their problems.
I am interested to use an STM32 Mbed or HAL for this purpose
Hmm yes you're right, we should expect 1 and 2, but aren't iterators themselves iterables? Why do you recommend not implementing both the iterable and iterator protocols on my class?
It's a commonality in the industry, not just in the Bay Area -- which isn't to say that you shouldn't look for places that have better questions proactively.
[removed]
(stdout, stderr) = proc.communicate()
Python isn’t great for web stuff.
My toolbox still doesn't show the 2019 version on Windows
For iterables, I say they should punt the actual iteration off to something else. Iterators are also iterables by necessity but they should return themselves when used with `iter` and there like. This is a pretty common idiom in the standard library (see the result of `iter([1, 2, 3])`) and worth following.
Thanks for letting us know. We're looking into the problem
Yep Jenkins would do that you can create slaves in it just like in celery and an remotely trigger them from command line like celery, and Jenkins even let's you put your python script directly into it so you don't have to call it, or use git instead
The Python Language Server is still very slow for me and taking huge amounts of memory.
 response = requests.get(url) print(response.ok)
Can you link to your code here? I didn't see the implementation of the \`cli\` decorator at [https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/b5wckv/new\_command\_line\_decorator/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/b5wckv/new_command_line_decorator/) either but it looks neat!
We have some ongoing work about startup time. You're right, it's something we need to bring down. For the Database tool, all panels can be detached and [put in floating windows](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/viewing-modes.html). Is that what you mean?
I meant more like a separate app, Its my understanding that PC pro has all the features of Datagrip. It would be helpful if I could work on the database, without starting pycharm itself.
Python is not yet a web-standard script like JavaScript. &amp;#x200B; You might consider a page that dynamically loads images, and then have whatever 3D backend you want on the server generating 3D images (2D renders of 3D scenes). &amp;#x200B; However, if you are looking for use-anywhere real-time 3D interaction (such as an online geological fly-by, for instance), Python simply isn't there. &amp;#x200B; Python can do many things, but it cannot (yet) insinuate itself as a default dynamic-web script for browsers. &amp;#x200B;
pickle is fine and works well if you do your own little scripting and want to pass something between scripts using the harddrive or store it for later use, etc. But you would never want to use it to store things in user facing programs or anything like that. It's not safe.
Yes, PyCharm's database tool window is basically DataGrip in a tool window. If you want it in a separate application, that would be DataGrip. See here: https://jetbrains.com/datagrip
I know I can download it, but then it has a separate subscription fee. Since I already pay for PC pro, i thought it would be nice to have DG bundled with it as a separate app.
How do you respond when people say VS Code can do everything Pycharm can?
same for linux
Sorry, the PyCharm Pro license is for PyCharm Pro, not transferable to DataGrip or WebStorm.
Pickle is more of a rapid-development convenience then a data interchange. 
This is very good information. Thank you. &amp;#x200B; Pickle, Marshall, and Shelve all have a warning about security. Is there a standard library that enables secure, trusted, validated data storage, other than json, xml, or yaml? (I assume that such a library will drop any attempts to store functionality, vs. data. In that case, how does it handle class objects with methods? I wouldn't mind if I had to store object "state" in variables instead of relying on method-based state-setups.) &amp;#x200B;

This is my second project that I have made. It's a very simple GUI. All you have to do is put the script in the same folder as the file you want converted to MP3. Then, open it and just follow the instructions. I think it can convert from any media file. But, it can ONLY convert to mp3 because why not? it's faster this way.
I don't yet have a lot of experience, but this sounds like a great addition, and from my simple point of view, the code looks clean enough. Great job! &amp;#x200B; I especially like the "relative\_to" method. &amp;#x200B;
I just fucking keep watching, because I thought it will do something at the end very efficiently. I probably watched that 20s clip like 20 times before I realized it is a 20s clip.
Hey op, just one question. How did you become so cool and awesome?
Check your swap function in the quicksort, you can actually do it like this "a, b = b, a"!
It looks like python 2.5 is what's compatible

Both snap and Toolbox should have the new version available now. How are you doing your upgrade?
I'll check again im using toolbox
How long does it take to code this?
very cool. Thanks for sharing.
As soon as the blog post with it goes live, I'll post. I tried to put it into comment (or text post) and was rejected as too long. It handles wildcard expansion as well, so if you have a method that accepts a single filename, and you can pass a wildcard that matches multiple files it will call the function multiple times.
I am trying to make a basic MTG card search engine as a project. The framework in question is Flask and all the data shown in the image is generated through MTG API. Mana cost(represented inside curly brackets) is of course just a plain text, but I would like to change that to specific image urls so I can display the symbols. What would be my course of action in using python or specifically jinja2? &amp;#x200B;
Hmmm, that's a bit tricky to answer. I started it about 4 months ago, but I wouldn't say it was my main project during this time. Almost all the Q learning code itself was actually from a previous blog post on my site, so I was able to reuse that. The robot code itself wasn't too bad either... I'd say the main factor that made it take so damn long was the nature of debugging problems with it. Whereas most of the time when I'm working on something, if something breaks, I can catch and fix it quickly. However, here, since it would have to run for ~30 hours straight, it might take a long time to find out something isn't working. Additionally, I (personally) find electronics a lot harder to debug -- with code, if something is wrong, you can often just print a ton of stuff out and see what went wrong right before it broke. With electronics, if there's some problem like the voltage dropping due to a heavy load spiking, causing the whole thing to shut down (which happened), it's a lot harder to be monitoring that constantly.
haha wow, I'm not sure I deserve that, but thanks!
I am actually not sure about that. I do know that tSNE cluster will only be subjective (points may look lose but are not explicitly labeled with a cluster membership). A good clustering technique I would suggest if you’re looking for explicit clusters is DBSCAN which also has an implementation in the sklearn library.
hah oh sorry! the clip shown is actually at the end of training, doing it somewhat efficiently :)
the Deepmind DQN Atari papers are a huge inspiration for me, they're incredible. I'm not sure if I can honestly call this "deep" QL because the deepest NN I use is only 2 hidden FC layers, but it's definitely the same algo.
I see, thanks!
This is something I am in the beginning stages of getting into for my own personal project. Will be reading the blog post and going through all of your code! Hope to learn a lot from you, thanks. This gets me excited to get going.
I’m not sure what editor you were using Jedi with but a lot of editors have support for the language server protocol (which is effectively what VSCode is using for the Microsoft python autocomplete). Vim’s ale plugin, for example, has support for fetching results from an LSP. Emacs has plugins as well. https://langserver.org/ https://github.com/w0rp/ale

1. Take the surf-declaration out of line 85 in the player "event" block. (Don't worry. We'll be putting one back in soon...) 2. In your player object's init block, add "self.images = \[\]". (This will be a list of images that will store different sprite images for our player.) 3. Below that, add "self.images.append(pygame.image.load(player\_image).convert())" as many times as there are player images to load. 4. For each of those lines, replace "player\_image" with 'mario\_right.jpg', 'mario\_left.jpg', 'mario\_left\_run.jpg', etc.... (i.e. "self.images.append(pygame.image.load('mario\_right.jpg').convert())") 5. Below those append lines, add "[self.surf](https://self.surf) = self.images\[0\]". (Replace index 0 (zero) with any index for the image with which you would like to start.) 6. Under the "event" method, under the "if self.left and self.rect.left &gt; 0:" line, add "[self.surf](https://self.surf) = self.images\[1\]". (Replace "1" (one) with the appropriate list index that corresponds to the 'mario\_right.jpg' image load.) 7. Similarly, under the "if self.right and self.rect.right &lt; X:" line, add "[self.surf](https://self.surf) = self.images\[0\]". (Replace "0" (zero) with the appropriate list index that corresponds to the 'mario\_left.jpg' image load.) By following these steps, you are pre-loading all the images for the player character in the init part, into a handy list, instead of loading them during gameplay, which may produce unwanted lag at the worst moment. Then you are simply setting "[self.surf](https://self.surf)" to the appropriate pre-loaded image in that image list during the appropriate action. &amp;#x200B; You may want to look into using sprite sheets, to load all your character animations in one big image, and then use image coordinates to use the correct image "part" for that particular bit of animation. Think: Walking animations, landing animations, attack animations, jumping animations, etc. &amp;#x200B;
Quick question, would you be able to speed up the process by running it on a computer at say 100x speed for the model to be formed, then port it over to thr robot and see the results? 
Yep, that's what I did shortly after building it, to test stuff! Saving models is easy in pytorch, so I trained it (~20 min) on my laptop, and then loaded the model on the robot. Despite there being some differences between the simulated and real env, it ran great with the PC-trained model. But I wanted to do RL with the real env, which ended up being the really hard part here :)
Wow thank you, that means a ton. What's your project about? Let me know if you have any questions about the code or project when you do it!
&gt; We might do a blog post on the what/why/how of the new Jupyter support. Think you'd be interested? YES!

&gt;We have some ongoing work about startup time. You're right, it's something we need to bring down. What is it doing during that startup time?
&gt; If you aren't packaging code for distribution but you still want to write code that's guaranteed to break as quickly as possible on a Python version you don't support, I've also written a guide to that. Thanks! I like this "break early" approach. So, let's say I'm just learning Python, and starting with the latest version. Do you know of any kind of static-analysis tools that can look at a piece of written code and figure out what the oldest version of Python it should work on? Something that might set a hard-stop like "completely breaks at 3.3" and warnings like "works at 3.3, but maybe relies on explicit ordering of dicts"?
Yes it's common, but I said something a bit stronger, that it's pretty much unavoidable out here. I have many dev friends outside of the Bay area that don't get these questions. I have none in the Bay that don't, at least my friends that are in a normal SWE role.
Neat!
The built-in json lib is not optimized there are many more json libs such as simplejson, ujson and [orjson](https://github.com/ijl/orjson). I think ujson is problably best for most cases since everything is 100% same from the built-in json library, all you do is change the import statement.

What happens after learning ?
Ty sir
I remember checking it out but I must have categorized it as similar to [https://amoffat.github.io/sh/](https://amoffat.github.io/sh/) and must have overlooked its path-related features. It sure looks great but it's much more comprehensive. I meant pathstring to be a tiny, single module that can be dropped in any project without having to be an external dependency. I published it on pypi for convenience but I guess I should emphasize this in the documentation.
FYI, the pickle warning about security only applies to using pickle on the wire. &amp;#x200B; Using pickles stored to disk can be done securely. The [ZODB](http://www.zodb.org/en/latest/) uses Python pickle and it's never had an serious security issues AFAIK. Inherently it's not among the most secure DBs, as if you have write-access to the DB files you can slip in an exploit - but in most systems if someone has gained write access to DB files they're probably well past the point where they need to escalate further. &amp;#x200B; If you want "secure, trusted, validated data", that's not something in the standard library, but something that's running at more complex level than what's in the standard lib. For example, "secure, validated" pickles would just, encrypt on the wire, encrypt on disk and do md5 sum hasing to ensure pickles haven't been tampered with. &amp;#x200B;
PayPal and direct transfers are the only ways to get paid?
Ahh yeah, I see what you're saying. I wanted to focus more on the robot aspect in this post and not waste space with stuff I had talked about before, so I linked to a [previous post](https://www.declanoller.com/2018/11/04/training-an-rl-agent-to-play-puckworld-with-a-ddqn/) where I first did RL with this game. But I see what you mean, maybe it could use a little more intro. Puckworld is just a dinky game some people use for RL examples. The goal is for the agent to get to the target, which moves around. There are lots of variants. Most I've seen let it move only in "cartesian" directions (up, down, L, R), so this one's a little different. In some variants, the target periodically moves, even if it doesn't get to it. In this one, I made the target stay in one place until the agent gets to it.
I can't see what it learnt.
&gt;DES encryption where/how are you learning it? &amp;#x200B;
thanks for the feedback! It's definitely messy but I want to make it more legit. I'm not super familiar with the PEP guidelines so I'm looking at them now. Can you show me an example of what you mean? thanks!
Sure! You can actually just run a linter against the code (or add one to your editor). I like [flake8](http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/)
I love pycharm, and I praise it all the time at the office. I'm thinking of giving a talk to the engineering team about how it is so good. But I must say, https://github.com/codercom/code-server is really making me think about switching. In addition to ability to do remote pair programming https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2017/11/15/live-share I worry that VSCode being electron gives it an edge, I can't see how pycharm can just render in a browser. Being an old dog, I really don't want to switch, but, dammm...
I suppose it does. That's a bummer, thought I'd searched pretty well. Not sure how big the overlap in users would be.
thank you

But what is it learning?
Yeah, sure
Is that a Bo-Bot? I uzed those in my engineering class in high school! 
popularity within what subgroup of python community? \- typical devs? - meh, most will (if use type annotation) choose mypy \- sysadmins/devops- mostly not \- kids/hobbyist/other non it professionals- nope as someone with comparable java and python experience i have to say there're starting to do and look exactly the same. type annotation = static typing java. protocols (pep 544) = interfaces. python has better support for slicing and objects (as function object) and java has streams.
your code isn't particularly impressive, to be honest. Here's a code much closer to what a professional program would be: https://pastebin.com/fLqHxuzg My point is that we shouldn't use words like "ridiculous" or "terrible" when giving feedback, instead something more concrete as redundant, non-idiomatic (un-Pythonic), sub-optimal, etc. is received better. Everyone was a beginner at some point, and we should always keep it humble.
Editing with something like Sublime with a linter plugin makes formatting extremely easy (as in after you type a line poorly, it auto formats it)
I am working on text based ‏adventure game that you are stuck on a lone island and you need to get out of there.
I can only get the source code tomorrow. However I can tell you it's simply through OLE.
Office offers a whole API for OLE.
So far there have do 2 helpful automations with Python. Tl:Dr: 2 helpfuly tools for pen and paper &amp; roll play. Long: 1: character attribute editor for D&amp;D Pathfinder. It's always like this: You get up to 25 points. With this you can buy points in attributes. A value of 7 gives -4 points, a value of 18 gives 17 points and so on. Many Charkter editors on the net need Flash. And if you change your mind you have to erase a lot on paper. 2: The loot of an opponent is distributed according to rules. There are opponents from level 1 to level 30. 25% should be in gold coins, silver coins and copper coins. 75% should be in the form of equipment. The program needs 2 inputs: Opponent level and loot progression level. It then calculates the Loot, distributes it randomly on coins (gold, silver &amp; copper) and random equipment worth 75% of the Loot.
Nope, it's just one of these cheapo robot kits: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01CXVA6IO with a tonnn of modifications. It's more hole than robot now!
Ooh, looks like Atom has some good linters, I'll def be checking them out, thanks!

We fortunately have some very smart Java platform people and actually ship our own customized OpenJDK. They're working on it.
Just to frame your question, is it along the lines of editor-versus-IDE?
my mistake, you have to clone the github repo or curl the bash installer. if you’re on windows, anaconda is still the best option for multiple versions.
Yeah basically :) one of the differences is that turtle is like a built in module developed by the python developers. But for example a module like pandas is made by third party people and has a few extra steps to use! 
essentially, yes
I dabbled with NN many years ago. I could never quite understand why one might elect to have multiple hidden layers or not. I play with some GAs to experiment with the number and size of hidden layers but it wasn't conclusive. Probably didn't have a suitable project. (My hobby was looking as public traffic cams and assessing traffic levels.). This was pre Google maps. What does influence hidden layer structures?
I want to switch to VSCode but I've had issues getting linters to work
Great way to introduce and explain PSG. I've seen a lot of miscommunication around it on this subreddit and I think this will clear up a lot for people interested..
the exact same thing happened to me
Yup.
Maybe I'm not completely understanding it. What is the benefit to `dataclasses` beyond cutting down on some boilerplate in your `__init__()`? 
I know it's not quite what you're asking but if you're after a job then the best thing to have is a university qualification - I did 6.00.1x on edx and it helped me get into a course and get a good job. I know that you can more or less do a third level computer science course online for free, unfortunately companies prefer a known quantity over an unknown one. I'm aware that the cost of education varies from country to country, so while it wasn't costly for me to do mine I'm aware that cost might be prohibitive for you. Apart from the that, MITx 6.00.2 is worth a look - in general anything increasing your knowledge of algorithms and data structures. If you are looking for a employment then looking outside python to things like agile/scrum methodology is a good idea. Good luck! 
Yes I saw the warning. The question therefore is, why is it still in python if it is that bad.

The idea is that each neuron combines the features in a linear way and passes it through some non linear function. So each layer's output is a nonlinear combination of it's input features. Each additional layer is a more complex combination of the networks input features. My ml Prof said that it's like each layer learns new, more complex features from it's inputs. So the more layers you have, the more complex features you can learn. Neural networks have been shown to be a universal function approximator, though that proof didn't require a certain layer size or network depth. So you could potentially have a single hidden layer network that is just as accurate as a deep network, but it might be a very wide layer. Finding a good architecture is a trade off between a few different things though

Kind of offtopic, but storing a long sequence of ints is hardly the typical use case for data serialization. For storing data with any kind of structure, sqlite is an often overlooked good choice -- and it's part of the standard lib as much as pickle.
You can do that pretty easily, but sometimes there's errors in the simulation or the physics is slightly different than the real world, that the robot learns to exploit the errors and then fails miserably in the real world.
This question gets posted *so much.* A quick search of this subreddit alone will yield answers immediately.
It’s super verbose. 
Well, I think it ultimately comes down to how complex the function you're trying to approximate with the NN is. NN's are ultimately just function approximators (FA). There are some famous proofs about how (given enough nodes/layers), they can approximate any function (with some reasonable assumptions). If you view each layer as applying a function to the output of the previous layer, then what adding layers is doing is composing functions, like f(g(x)). So (I don't know off the top of my head) I'd guess that even if you *could* theoretically get the job done with fewer layers, many problems naturally have structure that lends itself to something that's like composed functions, or hierarchical. A classic example would be with CNNs, where you can look at what the conv. layers are doing at different scales. Using GAs (or EAs) to design the architecture of NNs is actually a very hot topic right now. For example: https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.01513 So maybe you were ahead of your time! I actually did another post ages ago with using a CNN to look at traffic footage in my neighborhood as well, [here](https://www.declanoller.com/2018/08/13/rpi-camera-part-3-a-few-incremental-fixes/).

Ok nice? 
Technically, yes, but I don't think it would qualify as "reviewed" in the process, if it's as hands off as a script would be.
Yup! Look into selenium for browser automation
Technically, sure. Practically, maybe experiment with something like AutoHotKey first before diving into Python. A Python implementation would most likely be "headless", meaning you wouldn't actually see all of this occur on screen. You would just run your script, maybe with some parameters, or maybe based on a CSV file filled with data to update and wait for it to wrap up.
I'm beating my head against a wall trying to figure out why one of my unit test cases is not working. [https://github.com/HankB/HA-host-monitor](https://github.com/HankB/HA-host-monitor). &lt;sigh&gt; Probably something stupid I'm overlooking. Or something I don't understand about Python (and that covers a *lot* of ground. ;) )
Ta will give it a go
Firstly, this isn't quite the right sub for this. r/learnpython is more appropriate. Secondly, you're not providing a tuple. For implementation reasons, a single element tuple needs a trailing comma. Add that in and you'll be fine.
In addition to the security issues people have mentioned, pickle produces an opaque output format that is only useful to other Python programs. If you need to do surgery on your stored data or integrate with non-Python code, a cross platform text format is going to be useable under any conceivable scenario and is very future-proof because you can produce tools for it in any language and platform. Human-readable formats are also usually easier to debug and test with.
Also, I'd use an `enum.Enum` rather than a vanilla `int` as the return code
This update is amazing, I love it, 
Ahh, thank you. I was not aware of that sub.
Yes - Thanks for your help on both accounts.
A school project I’m gonna fail
It's been quite a while since the last set of [PySimpleGUI YouTube tutorials](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/9nvdmw/tutorial_beginning_as_in_your_first_time_gui/). There has been a lot of evolution that's happened since the prior videos. This video points out how the new ports are changing the entire PySimpleGUI experience. It's an introduction from a completely different angle than before.
In addition to the security concerns, pickle can be brittle. It can depend on the currently imported modules and even changing the version of a module can make a pickle unreadable. When you pickle something, dont expect it to be readable on another system or even the same system after some time passes. 
Thats a great idea. Selenium will be the best choice. You will save tone of time. The only thing you have to make sure is your data reviewed before you process. Its not just about saving time, increases accuracy by a lot
Thank you!
Thanks
Streaming downloads is kind of a big missing feature. Otherwise this looks pretty good!
 UserKetchup_str=raw_input("Would you like ketchup? $0.25 a packet.") spent = 0. if UserKetchup_str== "yes": spent = spent + 0.25 print("ok") You need to accumulate the cost to a variable like the **spent** one above. It needs to be done after making sure the user wants to buy one, after the if check for "yes".
It's useful when security isn't a concern. I can pickle data from my own program for my own use. I can think of easier ways to hack myself than messing with the pickle. If you take it out you break existing code.
It's learning to get to those blue squares that show up on the boards. I have no idea how the agent knows about those cause they're definitely superimposed over the video.

Bought a personal license today after using the Community edition for over 1.5 years. I purchased it spur-of-the-moment after getting the 999th prompt for 'Professional Edition has special support for Django/Flask'. I was just looking to find out more about it when I saw it was only $90/year and figured I use it enough. Now my perpetual fallback is for 2019.1! - I didn't even know it was being released today.
I use both. PyCharm for larger projects and VS Code for smaller scripts. When I have PyCharm open at work I sometimes use their scratch file feature for scripts though. 
A program to get the http stream from a website url. There are actually two m3u8 files. I extract and parse them to get the files containing the segment names. I generate the necessary links and download each part of the video. I have to join them to create the final video. It's relatively simple but I had no idea how streams work and didn't expect them to be delivered in segments. My main project is a scraping one because I want to archive a series of documentaries and interviews from my country's national TV channel website.
No, but you might be able to create a frameless transparent window.
Why would It be impressice ... Its tutorial code. Your code.isnt a proper simulation or professional. It shouldn't be professional though bc than would be confusing for op. My refactor is educational for op. Yours could be too except you've added a new library and broken the simulation. So if you're done swinging your dick at me we can admit ops code shows the needndor a huge amount of education.

What benefits does this provide over using using [aiohttp](https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp)?
Being designed for API parity with a library as universal as \`requests\` is a big plus.
My answer is gonna be a combination of all the answers here. 1. If your job typically involves "reviewing" something, you should be careful that automating the process doesn't circumvent what your employer is looking for with the review process. 2. Python Selenium is worth looking into if the "boxes" you're talking about are coded in HTML and not some funky Flash/Silverlight/Java applet. It should be noted you'll need to learn basic HTML identifiers to use Selenium, but those are kinda easy to pick up. 3. If the form you use at work *isn't* plain HTML then you might have to resort to using something like AutoIT, but that's not Python.

This issue should help when we can get to it: [https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-python/issues/1456](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-python/issues/1456).

This is a perfect question for /r/learnpython, something the bot has told you about before. I see you've made multiple posts there, and as I'm sincerely curious, if you wouldn't mind explaining why you chose to ask this question here as oppose to there I'd appreciate it. If you haven't solved this and if it's still an issue, I'd recommend asking there, but including the error traceback, as well as the code that generated it, the modules you've imported, and which python version you're running.
It's actually not a very large NN! The biggest I did was 2 hidden layers, each with 50 nodes. I was worried at the time that this might be too big, but actually another commenter here mentioned that the Pi can handle much bigger NNs.
I second your opinion. I am not aware about the case in other countries, but speaking of India: the job sector here is very competitive. You have thousands of people applying for the same position. Now the resulting candidate pool is quite large and varies drastically in skills and competencies. There is no standardized way of gauging whether you are the right fit ? &amp;#x200B; Hence to cut the crap, we have couple of screening rounds which test your general computer science abilities. It is just additional layer of filter to weed out false positives. &amp;#x200B; BTW, thanks for the link. I will try out the problems. They really seem exciting.
Thank you for pointing this out. Will update it :)
Never knew that... fantastic work though!
Thank you for your suggestion. Will be making a documentation on all the questions and respective description. Feel free to contribute to this repository. You can upload your solutions as well: It may not be necessarily in Python. The key purpose is learning :)

So I'm not an expert Matplotlib-er, but I use it from time to time and much prefer the OO interface because I don't feel like I really understand what's going on when I use pyplot. There's a little discussion of pyplot vs. the OO API in Jake Vanderplas' [Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/), though eventually most of the examples appear to use pyplot. I think if you look at the first few sections of that and spend a fair amount of time fiddling with the [Matplotlib Axes class documentation](https://matplotlib.org/api/axes_api.html), you should be able to (mostly?) replicate pyplot plots with the OO interface. I really wish there were better resources for this; the MATLAB/pyplot interface is horribly un-Pythonic imo.
Pyppeteer is much better, although it only works on chromium.
Why do you think it’s jerky? Does it have above zero epsilon?
Yes, thanks.
I'll look into that (as well as reviewing the syntax for tuples.) best,
Awesome thanks 👍
just git gud ;p
So adding a model to it will definitely speed up learning, but at that point it will be a less general technique. The cool part about RL is that the same algorithm can be applied to lots of different problems. There's also model-based RL algos, however.
It does indeed! I set it to have a eps_min of 0.05. This was actually fairly crucial I think, because it could get itself stuck in various places.
on which python nodule it's based on?
This is awesome. I work in a very technical call center, and I'm just learning how to do language analysis on our tickets to better understand what issues we commonly face and how we can better prioritize incoming issues to better help customers. I'm wanting to look into reinforcement learning, because I want to build a ticketing system that learns how to better prioritize incoming issues to help my team focus on the right stuff. Your project and generous sharing might give me the insight I need to better understand how to leverage this for my project! Thank you! 
I think it's because most people who use pyplot use it within jupyter.
Hello There are many online platform which provides online Python courses . Out of which some are very good and some are below the average . It is very much necessary to know about the Institute or sites before we Enroll .We should check first whether the Institute provides proper platform to work on live projects or not. We also should know whether the certificates which they provide are valid or not. Some of the popular sites which provides good courses for Python are Edureka , sololearn . Online learning is a good platform to learn python but for beginners i suggest you to Enroll in [Diploma in Python Courses](http://pythonandmltrainingcourses.com/courses/best-diploma-in-python-course-in-delhi/) because the certificates which you will received at the end of the courses is very valuable and you can get good knowledge as a beginner in the field of Python.
I don't think that makes a big difference. Almost 100% of my Matplotlib usage is in Jupyter as well.

The variables on top are global while the variables within the function are different ones. Local ones to your function. This is because you assign them inside the function. So once you exit the function the two left and rigth variables will not reference the same value anymore. From the docs: &gt; In Python, variables that are only referenced inside a function are implicitly global. If a variable is assigned a value anywhere within the function's body, it's assumed to be a local unless explicitly declared as global.

You can set your boolean variable to True inside the infinite loop or your game loop. It's like checking for events the entire time, hence they use `While True:` in most examples. Your code should work when inside a loop. I don't see infinite loop in your code..

May sound dumb but have you checked if micropython is ported to any of the boards you currently own? You can also check for other boards not only for micropython with a compatible port for the controller
Well, you don’t get a dependency that’s bundled up with an entire web framework. And it’ll give you API parity with Python’s most popular &amp; well-known third party package, and behaviour generally matching requests for some trickier edge cases. On the downside, right now we’re still missing a couple of features (streaming uploads/downloads, proxy support).
Is the Jupyter support worth it? Considering the pro version just for this feature

Alright! i found [this reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/7rfwnn/pyqt5_round_window_or_frameless_window_surrounded/) and tried the code in the first comment and i think it works for what i need, thanks
spacevim for the best! Can write notebooks, show recent locations and do much more.
This is also the way youd find the version of anything on linux. 
A comprehension is more limited in scope compared to a for loop which involves arbitrary control flow. So using a comprehension makes the intent clearer and limits the possibilities for mistakes. 
I'm guessing it gets the video feed passed to it

I'm happy with the default theme, other than the size of the whitespace markers. Is it possible to alter these by making a custom theme?
Usually linux programs are (-v) lowercase, Python you have to do an uppercase -V.
Will post there next time, thought it was only for asking questions. 
I think you can't compare them. cx\_Oracle lets you to talk directly to the database engine writing SQL queries, and the SQLAlchemy's purpose is to let you to run queries without a single line of SQL. If you're strong on Oracle's SQL and PL/SQL you should definitely go with cx\_Oracle, you get a very high level of control on what you're asking the database to do; if you're handling a big amount of data, this gives you huge benefits on performance and fine-grained quieries. If you don't know SQL and you're not willing to learn it (and it takes some time to master it properly), use SQLAlchemy. &amp;#x200B;
keep your self promotion links to yourself please
Performance was my main concern. I am good with Oracle SQL. so I'll go with it suggestion.
YOU DON'T NEED TO SCREAM THOUGH

Notice that t-SNE does not retain distances but probabilities, so measuring some error between the Euclidean distances in high-D and low-D is useless. It is a visual analysis tool. It let's you just identify that there might be relationships in a lower dimension that allow for clustering.
Make an if statement in your function? 
Thank you for that information, I don't have any formal training, just read a few books and such. I'm feeling my interest, being piqued again. Your project is far more complex than mine. The roads I was monitoring were long, curving highways, and I just used a colour histogram, time of day, day of week, sunset and sunrise. Quite successful. Nice chatting.
Download VScode ... the best code editor I’ve used till date(still using it). Go into the json file settings in the editor and apply a formateOnSave rule to true for python and pip install flake8 linter for the project. Then it should format your code when you save.
I always just use the extended '--version". Honestly disnt know about the shorthand -V lol
Have you had a look at CFFI?
The list set approach also loses the original order. Which I guess is the main reason they wrote it like they did.

Okay cool. I'm learning... why can't you have it learn for a longer time and then put the epsilon to 0? Also, could it be possible to change epsilon based on whether it finds something new, so if something is added to the environment and the robot runs into it epsilon raises again?

Not yet, but after a quick look, usefull :) Nonetheless, CFFI needs to have explicit compilation steps and stuff, I just wanted a plug and play thing where I can basically just have C files as part of my project and directly import them without any extra setup work. No extra dependencies required. 
This article was a great resource when I was first orienting myself to matplotlib. It really helps you get your bearings for the OOP api, as well as common workflows/practices for visualization using matplotlib. Hopefully this helps! https://pbpython.com/effective-matplotlib.html
Our requirements seem to be different then :-) &gt; CFFI needs to have explicit compilation steps and stuff This is all done automatically during `pip install` &gt; Also, I like directly using the python C api without abstraction. I really don't :-D I want to continue using my clean, unmodified C code without any `PyObject` garbage, plus a thin wrapper written in Python that converts my Python objects to native C data structures.
1. You're looking for /r/learnpython 2. You're using a closed connection to a database. So... make sure you aren't closing it _before_ this line of code 3. It's impossible to help fix the code without actually seeing it. An error message is not enough. It's also pretty clear (see #2).
You are welcome. The project is cool though. 
Yes. Use PRAW.
I just put a bot up in aws lambda that is driven by dialogflow 
I'll make a note on the ticket that you pushed for it.
I built a bot for front line support that can access read only info in GSuites (for example it can tell the support agent if a user has any filters setup in their email) The python code I wrote is for fufillment and it sits up in aws lambda. I use dialogflow to parse phrases and it's currently running in Slack (although it should be relatively platform independent). I'm pretty happy with the little guy.

We have a 30 day eval, so perhaps download that and give it a try. 
Yah, my use-case is not the creation of packages, but for quick-and-dirty research coding. Without the python c api you loose the ability to for example iterate over python lists and stuff. If I use C I want max performance ;) Different use-cases ;)

Yes, but it would be more work to write this program than to do it manually. I can't find it now, but there's a way to make a "multi" of all your subs. Do that and save the URL aside. Log in to the new account and go to that URL. Click "subscribe" on everything.
I got a response: "We are preparing a big change to fix all such kinds of problems (mouse selection, structural selection, variable renaming, etc.)"
Take a look at cython. It’s what I use. 
Take a look at Flask or Django and develop a website. This can show the full stack, and it's easy to just give a URL to someone to experience it. Also host it in the cloud (e.g., AWS). Finally, use GitHub to version your work, and make the code available. There's a lot to do, but it's an interesting and involved project that will help you.

In a sense, it's apples and oranges. VS Code is an editor, we're an IDE, so we compare more with Visual Studio. As an IDE, we think more about your entire project and activities. We index all the code, apply consistent refactorings across everything, integrate things into a consistent UI where things work together. And we take ownership of assembling a finished, supported product...you don't pick community plugins and wire things together. At the end of the day, stuff edits code on disk. You could theoretically do everything [with edlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edlin) so really, it’s more about the experience you get along the way. 
**Edlin** Edlin is a line editor, and the only text editor provided with early versions of MS-DOS. Although superseded in MS-DOS 5.0 and later by the full-screen edit command, and by Notepad in Microsoft Windows, it continues to be included in the 32-bit versions of current Microsoft operating systems. *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Python/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28
This will depend on a lot on what field you would like to go into...Examples: * Web dev - get some projects using multiple different frameworks (django, flask, and maybe one of the newer async Web frameworks) and make sure to demonstrate clearly in code and documentation how you have written the code to mitigate against common Web vulnerabilities (SQL injection, CSRF, XSS, and others from at least the OWASP Top 10) * Data analytics - demonstrate competency with pandas, etc and rendering output/results in charts /graphs with matplotlib, bokeh, and others * Security/Pentetration testing - show off knowledge of scapy, fuzzing with python, and those sorts of things * High performance - write some projects that use Cython or that use python for the interface/high-level code but bind to performant code written in C++/Rust Beyond this, find a few existing open source python projects on Github in a domain (such as those listed above) that interest you and see if there is stuff you can add/contribute (only if it is just improved documentation to start with). This is important because, as compared with solo portfolio projects, it will demonstrate that you are capable of working on significant projects as part of a team. Teamwork will be pretty much essential for any industry/corporate project that is bigger than just a couple of scripts here and there. Hope this helps!

Also, why do we use non-linear transformations at the output of each layer? If we used linear transformations at every layer, then the neural network as a whole would be represented as a single linear function, as the composition of linear functions is a linear functions. In this case the neural network would not be able to learn much.
Put the code on pastebin or similar. Link to it.
Yeah like I said, if order is important you would need to do something like: def ordered_remove_duplicates(arr): unique_set = set(arr) unique_arr = [] for n in arr: if n in unique_set: unique_arr.append(n) unique_set.remove(n) return unique_arr
I think pretty much any type of hobby project is good on your resume. Keeping well structured, documented, and clean code in a Github repo with a Readme explaining the motivation behind your project I think is a dealbreaker.
Cython is a godsend for this, and I somehow think it cannot get easier than Cython while retaining the flexibility and power Cython provides.
I used pastebin and updated the code. Please help me out with the issue i am facing. Thanks

I couldn't really find any appropriate tickets, \[this one was the closest\]([https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-209535](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-209535)). Mind creating a ticket, or want me to do so?
1. /r/learnpython 2. Use [Python Tutor](http://pythontutor.com/) to visualize your code.
Regular, Anaconda was much much worse. I'm running it as "Python: Terminal (integrated)" (currently the single default configuration for that type of thing); though I just looked more carefully at it and actually it seems that the more than half of the pause is before VSCode even pastes the launcher command into the window, which is weird. On a related note though, I checked and ptvsd has a better performance under the debugger, but it's still around 5-10 times slower than "start without debugging". There's a dead simple optimization that pdb uses: if there's no breakpoints set, it just removes the trace hook entirely and runs the program at 100% native speed. This way I'd still get a break on exception, still can pause the program and see what it's doing (this requires reinstalling the hook in the signal handler in case of pdb, could be complicated in your case, idk to be honest), and most importantly this would almost entirely remove the cognitive load required to decide how to start the program, I'd just debug it by default with a clean conscience.
&gt; 6 essential Python libraries for Python programming that every Python developer or aspirant must know about &gt; Neural Networks Library Come on. Can't we ban this garbage?
It's just that `strip` returns a new string, it doesn't change the original. Use `a = a.strip()`
You really want /r/learnpython for this but briefly the difference is that strings and several other built-in types are immutable so methods like .strip() return a new instance with the change applied. Lists are mutable so the .append() operation is done in-place. You can read more here: [https://medium.com/@meghamohan/mutable-and-immutable-side-of-python-c2145cf72747](https://medium.com/@meghamohan/mutable-and-immutable-side-of-python-c2145cf72747)
Hey thanks! I appreciate that.
Beyond the behavior of the two functions that has already been mentioned, in python lists are mutable objects but strings are immutable. This can also be confusing if you use a mutable object as the default to a function param.
Excellent question. A string (of type str) is immutable meaning a value can only be assigned once. Any change to a string produces a new string. In your example a.strip() returns a new string. A list is mutable there for functions on it change the lists state (sort is another useful one). id is a useful function giving the number python uses to keep track of the objects. x = ' hello ' print(id(x)) x = x.strip() print(id(x)) This code shows how x is now referencing a new string. I also recommend using the function help on methods and types. help(''.strip) help([].append) and type type('') &gt; str type([]) &gt; list help(str) help(list) That will give you a clear explanation if a type is mutable or not. Strings and numbers are immutable generally. 
I think the solution here is to wrap this function with one that you use to call it, and then add class as an input and output. You could also achieve this using a decorator.
You do `cur.close()` on line 35 of your paste, so from that point the connection is closed. 
I just built my first program/application in python. It automates my Salesforce entry at work by creating a contact, opportunity, and tasks I used the simple-salesforce module and created a GUI with tkinter, then made it executable with Pyinstaller. I may have just saved 15-20 hours of work per month. And I learned way more about python doing this than any tutorial I watched. I'll probably add a few more features to it. But it was fun, mostly in hindsight after all the debugging. 
I believe that with this ticket is enough. I have found other: https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/PY-34903. Thank you very much.
1. /r/learnpython 2. The `"ResponseData"` value is a list of multiple items, each with its own `"Header"`. Which one do you want?
Your `ResponseData` element is a list, you need to specify an index before trying to access `header`. Use `print(parsed["ResponseData"][0]["Header"])` to print the header of the first one.
You cant host it on the cloud indefinitely though right? I mean, once their free tier account is used up, you'd have to pay out of pocket?
Beacause ResponseData is an array. You should access it like ["ResponseData"][0]["Header"]

Yes, AWS will eventually start to charge you. But it's minimal, unless you start getting lots of traffic. There are other cloud options, e.g., Azure, Google Cloud, and Google's Firebase. If we're talking about a couple dollars a month, it may still be worth it.

I apologize in advance for a kind of non-answer answer, but just to provide information...it's something we've looked at and worked some on.
Pure insanity. I've been working on implementing the Windows Desktop Duplication API (i.e. Screen Capture) in pure Python + ctypes. We are talking wrapping parts of Direct3D and DXGI that both use COM interfaces. I don't recommend anyone ever goes in that deep; there is very little prior art. Sadly, I had a great want in that functionality so I persevered. &amp;#x200B; That said, I just got it working and boy is it ever fast! I benchmarked capturing a 2560x1440 display to a buffer of RGB numpy arrays. [MSS](https://github.com/BoboTiG/python-mss) (the best for cross-platform IMO) struggles to maintain 20 fps and this approach maintains 60+ fps. Very niche but also very exciting. I'm polishing now (adding different output options: PIL image, PyTorch tensors etc.), but I am going to release a package soon.
Working on a program for my wife (school librarian) that queries the new york times best seller list and returns the results for different subjects (chapter books, young adult, etc)
It uses [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/) to do the gradient descent, but that's a small part of it really.
That sounds very cool. To be honest, it seems like simpler statistical methods can still be more reliable than RL for some applications! It's complicated haha.
Yes, it is OK. But make sure that levels of "nestedness" reflect the logic of your algorithm, and remember [zen of python](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/): &amp;#x200B; &gt; Flat is better than nested. &amp;#x200B;
From an conceptual approach the best thing would be to mark all their anti-scraping machanisms and work on them one at a time. A easy first approach is to change your UserAgent-String. When they have to many measures it could be easier to use a headless browser. The lower performance and "added complexity" could pay off in terms of code manageability.

It depends. In general, if I see that kind of code to review, it's a smell. Maybe you solve it by rearranging the code, maybe by inverting the logic, maybe by extracting some methods or functions. It's hard to say, but if I see two ifs one after another I start to think there's something wrong.
even i checked by commenting line35. even though i am getting same issue &amp;#x200B;
1. /r/learnpython 2. `Files` is by itself a list, so `FileList` is a list that contains one element, which is also a list, and that's not what you want.
1. /r/learnpython 2. `getpass.getuser()`
You are welcome. :)
1. thanks for that I should have probably posted there. 2. Thanks for answering my question anyway. that makes sense! 
Thank you, that worked! &amp;#x200B; Easier than I thought
\+1 for selenium, though not sure if its HIPAA compliant ;)
Take a look at the other arguments for solve_ivp. There isn’t a previous state per say, you you can compute everything. You can also use a constant time step and append values to a list and store them as input args. Also, it’s scipy’s method not Python’s. You’re referring to state and not solution (big difference). Also, check out /r/learnpython.
PyCharm is really good. I use Professional edition in my office and convinced my coworkers to also buy a licence. I just have one complaint. PyCharm doesn't have a good dark theme comparable to VSCode Dark Theme or Atom One Dark Theme or Molokai Theme. That's one thing which is really missing. It would be really great if official dark theme is supported. I am aware of Darcula Theme but it isn't comparable to other dark themes mentioned above. 
You're asking a really important question! So yeah, I think ideally, if you had a completely stable environment (i.e., the rules don't change; so even though in this example the target moves around, the rules are the same, so it is stable), you'd want to slowly anneal the epsilon to 0, because if you've actually figured out the right Q function, then the epsilon just has the effect of making you choose the wrong action epsilon percent of the time. However, from what I've seen, even in research papers, they seem to always keep a non zero epsilon_min. I think this is because (I address this a little bit at the very bottom of the blog post) even when you've gotten pretty close to the ideal Q function, there are probably still a few slightly suboptimal parts it has, which letting it explore a bit forever can fix. There's actually a theorem that has to do with all this stuff, if you google "greedy in the limit with infinite exploration". As to your other question, it's a really good one. You're essentially getting at the concept of "plasticity", which people are still researching relatively recently. Here are two good papers I've read where they try to handle exactly the situation you're asking about: [1](https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/63917/files/gecco2000.pdf) [2](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.10371.pdf). I think it might be kind of complicated. For example, in simple model free learning like this, I don't think the agent has a concept of "new" -- for example, how does it know it's not a rare event (in a probabilistic env) vs a signal that the env itself has actually changed? Another complicating factor is the learning rate, ie, how fast you update the weights. Typically you also anneal (decrease) this over time (I'm just having the pytorch optimizer handle it here for convenience), but you'd also want this to change if something about the env actually changes.
wow thank you, that really means a lot. That's a really cool application, because a lot of what people do with ML are just silly toy problems (like mine, which is literally a toy :P). RL could be useful here, but a common thing you hear people say is to not use RL when another ML strategy is more applicable. So it seems like it could be good for your problem, since there's an aspect of exploration maybe. If you want to learn some RL, I found David Silver's course (on youtube) really approachable and invaluable. Let me know if you have any questions and I could try pointing you in the right direction!
Sorry, I didn't explain it here because I talked about it in the article. The agent gets the information about the targets from the environment. The video has nothing to do with the learning, it's a separate system that I just record from and later combine with the location of the agent/targets, which I also record.
If you're doing video games, definitely check out the Deepmind Atari papers (starting in 2015). They have lots of tips that are specifically applicable to video games, like frame skipping/combining, using diffs between frames, stuff like that.
Thank you! That's the direction I needed. I do want to use other ML strategies to do an initial evaluation, but after that, I think new stuff could stand a feedback loop to automatically improve it. I already have over 200k tickets for initial data, and I'm more concerned with adapting my queue as our market shifts and new problems arise. It'll be months before I can really leverage this information into something meaningful, but I'll be sure to pay it forward. 
I think: * It's limited to C and the basic python C api. No higher level abstraction. Which is, IMO a plus, because I'm not a fan of abstraction at this point, but a lot of people would disagree. * It's not the best solution if you want to package your code, if you want to actually deploy it via pip, you should maybe consider pre-building it. It's use-case is dynamic rapid prototyping for research purposes, if you want to stick to the default python without any extras. Reason for that might be that you need to share that code with other people and don't want to introduce a whole lot new dependencies in the project, this would be an easy and clean way to achieve that. 
There's a job board at the top of this subreddit.
If you want all control and will be one using these document, i would suggest you "Bootsnote". You can write down code snippets using markdown and sync files across computers using gdrive, rsync etc..
You can use FileList.extend(Files) instead of .append() if you want to add the contents of one list to another list
Cython is a python-compatible language, but not the same. If you work in a team that just uses the default python, cython isn't very useful, because it breaks compatibility with your team mates. This project doesn't.

I don't get it, is this simply a template for interfacing with C?
Heroku has an indefinite free tier if you don’t need good performance. A T2.micro and an S3 bucket (Managed by elastic beanstalk) on aws will cost you like $5 a year. 
Yes, it's nothing fancy, just a copy-paste and you can write C code. I just wanted something like this and didn't find it anywhere. So I decided to make it public.

Vow I really had to come and put this, I am a newbie here. I want to subscribe to a redis pubsub channel in Python whose pub is done in nodejs, I am so overwhelmed with the number of options here 1. One post says do it in the main thread 2. ONe post says use threading.Thread to receive messages from redis pub 3. Another says, above has GIL limitations so use multiprocessing 4. And now you are saying there is something called ASYNCIO that can also receive stuff from redis 5. I did some research on GIL and I get the idea, asyncio s like nodejs event loop stuff whereas threading and multirprocessing are somewhat like their java counterparts but what the hell am I supposed to do lol
If all else fails you might be able to scrape with selenium. Definitely the slower alternative but it works.
I am very happy with my Wemos/Lolin D1 Mini, which is based on the ESP8266. For a couple bucks more, you can get a Lolin D32 which has the newer ESP32. They are all below $10.

I'd use scrapy, but looks like I'd have to write OOP code. Not bashing OOP, just haven't had to use OOP much.
Would “FileList += Files” also work? Or is that a non-pythonic way to do it?
Ok, this is creepy. You linking 2 year old article at this moment. I just read that 30 min ago. 
Well, more that it's self-documenting and has less notation. Instead of importing new classes for every column type and instantiating them as class members, you just use native Python notation to lay out a schema, which is what dataclasses are so great at.
Have you looked at pybind11?
Nah you won't - that feeling of impending doom will keep up your productivity!! Former student here - you can do it!!

Yes! As soon as I need to incorporate C++, I think I will create a new version of the code with pybind11. I didn't do it yet, because I wanted to just create a very simple basic version for people/me to start off with. The biggest reason is that including pybind11 removes this beautiful complete platform independence that the current code has, by enforcing c++11 compiler flags (which are compiler dependent).
You can pick up NodeMCU boards for $5 and they work well when reflashed. I’d recommend avoiding the ‘fatter’ versions as they aren’t breadboard friendly. 
I've been using ctypes to wrap user32 stuff and having a pain debugging it because it crashes the python IDLE to a restart, and the console closes. It only happens maybe 1/10 times when I run my code. Infuriating :(

Why not proactively scrape recipes then run them through as a test? Then make it available as a database, which would probably make people from mealprepsunday very happy. Everyone hates having to scroll down a blog post to find the recipe only to realize there is no calorie information.

This guy's bash code is just awful
"If you write bash as bad as this, you should be writing python instead" - more accurate title? I write bash as much as I can, and as soon as I start getting out of my element, I go to something more familiar, like Python or Node.
It is fixed with the solution indicated by Ernst Haagsman in the link you say. Thank you very much for the support.
Don't reinvent the wheel, virtually every system will have a process supervisor and means of file rotation.... USE IT. Writing and reading pid files, what is this the dark ages?!

Gnu utilities, bash, awk, perl and python - I have learnt and use them all as they have different strengths. Python is crap at one-liners; perl is great for that one-liner with complex regexp; awk pattern-action is sooo useful; and the gnu utils often take care of corner cases that writing your own Python/Perl/... script to do would take time (and knowledge). &amp;#x200B; It's a complex tradeoff.
Slow? I mean I love Python, but awk, sed, grep, sort, cut, etc. are highly optimized C programs that have been tweaked for decades and they will probably blow Python out of the water in their specific niche
Don’t know abt that one chief it’s due tomorrow and I’ve got 3 lines

Hello, I understand that this can not be done in google drive, what can help you is Google Colab https://colab.research.google.com, it allows you to write and execute python code among other things.
Because this is not the goal for this project, it was to easily extend the natural Python implementation flow to C files. ctypes just wouldn't be the right tool in this scenario, I think.
Good question ... feel free to find out! Sadly I personally don't work with C#, so I won't add it to these code samples.
Is this about me or..
Thx but does it support matplotlib and numpy? 
Done.
Yes, Go to page. In de first page have a many examples. &amp;#x200B; For example: [https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/mlcc/first\_steps\_with\_tensor\_flow.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/mlcc/first_steps_with_tensor_flow.ipynb) &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;

Just today I heard about the Live Share ability of Visual Studio Code (from Microsoft). Never used it, but I understand it allows multiple parties to collaborate on the same code. Here's an old article on the feature before it was released. https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2017/11/15/live-share
Seems interesting ! I'm checking it out ! &amp;#x200B;
wow, the amount of that I don't understand what you're saying, is amazing!
&gt; they give little insight into a candidates actual programming skills Have you been involved in candidate selection? These question give enormous insight into [programming skill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_variable), that's why all the major companies use them, and they're not going away any time soon.
Hi there, check out Atom code editor. It has an amazing Teletype plugin. One of you opens up the file you want to edit on their computer, generates Teletype link, and then sends it to another. Then the second of you can track changes and make changes themselves in that file remotely in real time.
Be honest. Did it really come out of nowhere? Lol. Look for "crash courses" on YouTube. Some days science courses I've done also include a short python introduction, but they're paid courses.
I've used teletype. It's really easy to use. 
Yes, its a long story but major changes occur each year They don’t know what they want and we have no idea how and what is the exam is going to be like This year we got Calculus based physics But we didn’t even take calculus or any lesson we only take the basic rules of deferenttion So We had to memorise tons and tons of formulas for each particular case. And now this an exam that is 10% of your entire gpa which in a programming language they never taught us. Also they removed biolody for this current year Yet They also have and exam for biology For stuff we didn’t take which I’ll have to learn on my own along side the programming language The last 4 years have been quite hectic 
Which is preferable, pyqt or tkinter?
Nor Pyside2 tutorials!
Pick the right tool for the job? Scheduled tasks can be easily done in windows (task scheduler) or Unix (crontab) and killing processes using is tools available taskkill or or kill (respectively) That said, maybe a python script that converts one format of information to another? (Eg .csv to json, markdown pipe tables) Gives you a better easy win? Just my 2 cents. Tbf I picked up python by exploring github rest api do to work requirements and I’m not a coder in any part of my career
Sounds like your grade is decided by arbitrary factors and therefor worthless as an indicator of success. 8 days to learn to program is a joke. Do you at least know which concepts will be covered?
100% recommend google Colab for this. It is essentially a Jupyter notebook wrapped with some google collaboration features, including making comments, etc. It has numpy and matplotlib installed out of the box, but also supports installing additional packages with pip. It also is pretty well documented. Not sure what you need SQLite for but that might be the only issue you run into if you need to persist data into a DB - but I’m sure there are ways to mount a database if needed.
Thank you for confirming
PyQt5 is sooo much better Source (I've used both)

If your a web developer, getting tested on whether you can reimplement a sort algorithm in Python is not very reflective of the skill sets required for the job. A test the assesses your OOP skills would be much more beneficial.
