I was doing this today in python3 with range. range(4)[-1] == 3 was surprised to discover range objects have a getitem I think I had been carrying the idea that range returned an iterator since the 2-&gt;3 migration years ago. Now its an Iterable 
You should look into https://www.vagrantup.com/. You can run Pycharm on Windows, and it will manage your Linux VM's, that way you're not running something heavy like Pycharm inside the VM.
I typically have a factory type class for doing this same thing, but in the constructor, something like: `from PyQt5 import uic` `` `class UicDialogFactory(QDialog)` ` def __init__(self, ui_file_path)` ` uic.loadUi(ui_file_path, self)` So here you just pass the path for any ui file into the `UicDialogFactory` constructor and you are good to go. The only drawbacks are you would need different factories for different qt superclasses, in this case it is a QDialog. Using uic like this also means that you probably won't have autocompletion for any thing from the UI file. I typically only use qtdesigner for less complex things though so this doesn't bother me.

I use regexes every week and have to look that shit up all the time. [This](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0596514271/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_i_ssieCb5HW88GM) is literally the only programmer reference book I've ever come across that's more useful than online docs/web searches/manpages/help output. 
If lawyers are using Python to automate some tasks, I am sure the same could be said for someone doing contract related work. It would involve lots of the libraries that integrate Microsoft Office or PDF readers. 
Thanks for your comment. Chalice is awesome, maybe I will explore it a little more in-depth with a blog post in the future. Cheers!
No documentation? I know developers generally don't like documenting...but a rule against it?
&gt; If lawyers are using Python to automate some tasks, That's interesting, where can i find some info on that?

Would like to see the code if you're willing to share it.
Time to clean up my README.md. So much changed in a year process wise.
I'll get back to you on that. Since I was doing so many things I hadn't done before and didn't really have a gameplan, it's a mess. Pretty embarrassing stuff. If you're doing something similar though I'd be happy to help you out.
Let me know if you need any help!
I am working on a P2P file transferring system. So far you can only send text files and image's and it's only setup on my local network. I'm mostly just doing it to get familiar with network programming and multi-threaded applications.

That sounds fun! Can you send me a link?
If I had a github account I totally would but sadly I don't so my best option would be to put the .py file in a folder on Google drive and just share it but that's kinda ghetto.
I think that programming is a great skill to learn whatever your industry, and if you're going to learn anything for shallow scripting, python is the way to go. It astounds me, the problems which office workers have which have been solved for decades in the software industry. Even stuff as simple as how you lay out documents can be vastly improved if you're in a programmin mindset.

I'm curious what benefits this would have over python's built in `tempfile`
This makes me feel so much better about myself.
In one of my python scripts I'm writing a test to compare if the Database table got seeded with the exact same data before and after certain files are loaded. What I do is run a command that does an SQL dump of that table, clean the database, wait for the DB to populate, and then do a file compare One of my biggest problems is that I don't know how to tell the program to WAIT until the SQL dump is complete. Even if you do it on Terminal there's no loading screen. I feel this is also more into SQL than anything, because I am thinking I need to access the logs and read through there if the sql Dump is completed. 
Haha fair enough. 
I would say that generally holds true, but in this given circumstance it’s false. Since python is used for a lot of computational science, it would be beneficial for users to have the functions be compatible with both numerical and symbolic inputs. Then users could chose at their discretion which would be the most efficient method per what they were trying to do.
Golly!
I se what you're trying to do here, Guido...
I mean it would be useful if you found some pictures of code you wanted to run...
Whenever I need a quick refresher on regex I always go back to https://regexone.com . Such a great resource. 
&gt; it would be beneficial for users to have the functions be compatible with both numerical and symbolic inputs You're not familiar with the Linux philosophy. Do one thing and do it well. As you add features, you slow things down. Sympy is the symbolic library or Python. Scipy is built on LAPACK. It's a highly optimized FORTRAN library that doesn't do it symbolically. I mean you can say it'd be nice to have numpy/scipy/etc. do everything thing for you in the most general way possible, but that takes a whole lot of time. There are other things that are higher priority to most people (like speed) or new features (e.g., scipy's amazing cKDTree, a fairly recent addition). I mean how do you even go about implementing a fast KDTree search algorithm or an FFT symbolically (my coworker wanted me to at some point; I balked)? Most people just don't do symbolic math.

Hi, i've been studying the same while not with the same objective (audio classification). I also suggest reading this book [http://www.dspguide.com/](http://www.dspguide.com/) ; I'd be very happy to discuss our understanding of the music signal if you got time around. There is already a lib doing that, however for the fun of the task i'll review it up, cheers for the work o7
Soo.... You have at least minimal documentation?
The vote weight and the obvious fact that your spam have been deleted should be enough of an answer :)
Ah, this is an incredible book, thanks for the link. I'll dive into it over the weekend.
Thanks for these pointers, really appreciate it!
How much do you need to pay for the entire course?
The book "Automate the boring stuff with Python" is often suggested for non-developers wanting to use Python for automating small tasks. Or, as suggested above, you can also use this time to become really good at Excel.

Realistically you can get up to writing semi-complex regex's fairly quickly if you regularly write regex replaces while editing code, i.e. vim's :s, or if you're doing lots (and lots) of hacky sysadmin work with sed and awk.

I'm a bit of a photographer and I'd like to see something like this in Lightroom. I was wondering if it is 'smart' enough to distinguish camera shake from bokeh? It looks like your test images are from a camera phone which has a small aperture and tends to make the whole image sharp if there is no camera shake. What would it make of an image taken with a large aperture with an out of focus background? Would it consider [this image](https://www.willmcgugan.com/blog/photography/post/wildlife-of-saint-ives/#bird1) to be blurry?
Thanks! That's so kind :)

Python
This exercise has 11 questions and solution is provided for each question. This random number generation exercise questions will help Python developer to learn the various techniques of how to generate random numbers and data in Python.
&gt;And little "pythonic" nuances like truthfulness. Really useful in writing truly pthonic statements and etc. I see a lot of java/c++ habits and its just ugly and not-so-pythonic. This is so much my case! :) I found Kaggle being a good tutor regarding this topic, after a lot of head breaking I always found my ugly for + counter + helper values etc. are way less effective (and beautiful) than their suggested solution. That's the thing I am really looking forward to love about python once I get there - the zen of simplicity.
You can slice them too 
Although Pyhton can be used in Full stack development too, apart from JavaScript, in that case you would be required to learn 2 separate languages. JavaScript for Front end and Python for Back end. On the contrary, going with JavaScript would be a better idea since JavaScript can be used across both Front end and Back end development. 
What is julia? Is it a programming language?
I did something like that back in '90. Because the mega-expensive IVR hardware only spoke COBOL. Sheesh. It was fairly primitive 'compiler' written in Perl. Worked well enough though so we didn't have to touch COBOL much once it was stable.
&gt;What is julia? Is it a programming language? Julia is a high-level general-purpose **dynamic**programming language

Python. It is beginner friendly, has tons of libraries available for ML/AI tasks. I don't see how Julia can compete when Java is struggling in this niche.

This kind of pattern matching is very common in functional and functional-like languages such as scala, erlang, haskell. It could be very useful to allow developers with a background in functional programming to be more comfortable in python.
Pythex.org is good for python regex. Put in regex and test data
You could use an array of bullet. I'd suggest that you create a class for the bullet with * attributes: - state - position: [x, y] - speed * methods: - is_out_of_screen: reset the state, positions - update_position: if state=='fire', update the position Then you create a second class which will deals with an array of bullet: * attributes: - num_bullets - bullets: array of bullets * methods: - fire (loop to find a bullet with state='ready' then change it to 'ready') - update (loop over the bullet and apply update_position) I hope this is will help you
Sounded like the rule was against writing documentation directly with the code. I'd imagine (read: really really hope) they still have documentation in a separate repo, or wiki, or something.
The last time I used selenium I was able to invoke chrome and interact with it in the background. I used it to generate a thumbnail from some html source on an Ubuntu server.

If you want to create a web framework, I recommend that you stay off jquery. It used to be super useful in the past, but nowadays it can do very little that modern JS can't, and it doesn't really align with modern web development.

No offense, but it's a very messy design. I suggest you check out Norvig's A* implementation in AIMA. It's not very Pythonic, but it's conceptually beautiful.
Yeah, I would stay off php and java, unless you have a very good reason to learn them. This isn't because I think Python is the best (even though I do think that), but becayse if you want to learn more languages, you'd be better off learning Kotlin or Go.
If it interests you, learn it. One big advantage of Python is the huge library set. I've not yet found a job were automation for process improvement isn't possible. If you find you are using Excel to process data, then there are advantages to slowly move to numpy and pandas based processing in certain realms. Aside from that, the act of programming does good things to help your logical thought process. This is something EVERYONE should go through.
I have started learning python 20 days ago so I know I have a lot to learn about. It was all my idea and I’m really proud that I didn’t look into someone else’s code but figured it out by myself. I will look into that and maybe learn something new, thanks! Also if you have any specific advices I will be more than happy to hear them. 
It actually is a skill to think about keywords to an issue in a way that will return what you are looking for. I've always intuitively done this and have had a hard time trying to teach how you make a good query. Many people are already in a mindset when looking and don't think to describe their problem domain to Google when querying.
This is your journey dude, I just thought I'd point you to a resource that really helped my mental clarity some years ago. The main advice I'd give, is to separate concerns. Create small functions, small modules. Composition is your friend.
Thing is i'm only looking to learn it if it a widely used tool in areas like purchasing and so on. I'm not interested in learning it for its own sake. When my MPA was more focused on urban planning I knew I would take it due to it being heavily used in GIS. Now that I've shifted focus to procurement, there is no need to learn it if its is not as heavily used in this arena as it is in gis. That's kinda the point of the post, it see if it is as heavily used. So far most of the posts seems to indicate that its a nifty little thing to learn to do a few things here or there, but so far it does not seem to be something that is a key component of that type of work.
I blame lack of meta-cognitive skills, the bad searchers don't think about how they solve their problems or what the essential aspect is of what try to do. For them the problem is a huge spaghetti cloud of things blocking their intention and they can't isolate the actual problem.
I think you shoudl edit the funcion into this: `def mult_two_add_three(number):` `print(number*2 + 3)` &amp;#x200B; `mult_two_add_three(1)` &amp;#x200B; You can change the given parameter according to question. I have used 1 here as it says so at step 2. I hoped it helped. &amp;#x200B;
I agree. The biggest part of solving a problem is defining and articulating the problem. Some times that is 90% of it. If that isn't done well, however, solution is almost impossible.

Just throw a search into google, maybe "pygame" will be a good start. Your journey starts with where you take yourself.
I've got past Pygame but some say it isn't that good, so I came here to get answers from professionals 
have you considered approaching your work more along the thought process of agile sprints? put aside fancy words and titles like "user stories", simplify it down to the bare notion of making units of work short enough and simple enough that you accomplish goals quickly and thus reap the mental reward. your list of projects resonates with me so square on the head it makes me dizzy. i got burned out after my last job, doing over a decade of this. i've stopped trying to "make something awesome" from point blank, and "add this small function, fix, or feature" in short spans of work. i plan for my next job to be \_this\_.
This is the correct answer. Lookup `selenium` and running Chrome/Firefox/whatever in `headless` mode.
I doubt python is über suited for game development still you can try kivy, pygame, or godot. Being said, Pygame can be a good start ! [u/DaFluffyPotato](https://www.reddit.com/user/DaFluffyPotato) [impressively showed](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/9h76as/super_potato_bruh_a_game_written_entirely_in/) that your probably relatively small knowledge of python/programming might not be limited by pygame ! 
I know systeminfo is an application that doesn't *only* write out text to the console. While it collects data, it shows some "progress" My guess is that when you're running without `--noconsole`, it's just re-using your console window, but when you take the console window away, it's hanging while trying to output that progress information. This would be my guess as to why netstat works, but systeminfo does not. Does it work if you try `output = subprocess.Popen('systeminfo', [stdout/stderr/stdin stuff], shell=True)` Also, try both without the `stdin=subprocess.PIPE` argument. That isn't necessary for what you're trying to do, and it might be part of the problem as well.
So, if I'm understanding correctly, it's a lot like `switch`/`match` - `case` statements?

A word of caution: There are no comments/documentation so if you want to actually understand how the program flows... good luck I guess. I kinda made this for fun and didn't want to go through the process of doing all that important stuff (plus I barely understand it myself).
1) Pay attention to the teacher 2) Work on reading comprehension
Nice! I'm going to have to go through this over the weekend or something, when I've got some time to throw at it.
If I wanted to write a book and knew pandas, after the initial idea is communicated, what does your purpose in the partnership become? Effectively, aren't you just saying you have an idea you want to sell up-front?
There are some issues in that area. But they can be solved and I plan or implementing those functions. 
Agree..I am looking for another brain who can give his inputs for this wonderful idea of writing the book and helping the community.. My initial idea can be edited if the co-author has something better. Obviously we need to converge somewhere and it cannot be my sole idea.
Honestly I think it would rate that photo well. We can always check and see what the laplacian score is. 
Well, in computational chemistry/physics we do. All the time. We have some packages specifically catered to our work (sympy quantum for example) which work symbolically and it is an absolute pain to translate them to numeric when trying to use scipy with them. It would be nice to see more packages designed for this field because, again, we use python quite frequently and the way it’s set up is not optimal for our use. The Linux philosophy is familiar to me, I just don’t believe it suits the needs of everyone at the current moment. That’s just my opinion, I respect your disagreement 
I love Thonny. I've been using it the last semester, and I'm impressed by the array of pedagogical tools. The author has also been very responsive to my bug reports!
iMO, for a write up with such a broad title, the writing is poor. There are so many things happening around python, and here we are discussing some old libraries.
If McAfee and Norton are troublesome for you guys, is there any antivirus software that you do suggest? I have a little experience with Avast (and it never seemed to cause me too much trouble), but perhaps yall have a better suggestion.

Honestly I wouldn't know, because I'm not on security. I use bitdefender at home and it seems to do the job without being instructive or any false positives. Bonus: McAfee just blocked Excel.exe. marvelous.
You used PIPE for handling output from process. Did you drain the buffers? 
Can't tell you how many times somebody has message me saying, "the thing is broken". 90% of the time I can ask them what error message they got, Google it, and the top result solves it completely. Or even better, is if there is a bunch of setup steps. They report back saying, "its broken". Then I get to spend an hour troubleshooting, before I realize that during the setup, one of the earlier commands did not actually complete successfully, but they didn't notice and just kept going along. That root cause analysis is apparently a real skill.
Glad you found it interesting. Let me know if you have any questions :) Cheers!

What do you mean by "look better", exactly? Also, /r/learnpython.
If you believe this post is only about libraries, you have missed the point. It's about spelling out a future for the language - JIT (or not to JIT), type annotations and their impact on performance or other affects such as automatic type assertions. The "libraries" as you call them are key tools and the reason people use the language. The vast majority of the community uses Jupyter notebooks.

---&gt; /r/learnpython has lots of resources 
I don't know. I read somewhere that it was necesarry to use stdin, stdout and stderr=subprocess.PIPE. I don't really know what to use else or if when I don't use them, how I can get the output and write it to a file.

When I write command line programs (once), I always (and by always I mean once) jazz it up with colors. And whenever I do that (late spring 2016), I use the colorama module. 
is this what you are talking about? &amp;#x200B; [https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/index](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/index)
/r/learnpython and read the sidebar.
If you don't intend to write into process stdin, you should use `stdin=subprocess.DEVNULL`. For outputs, when using `subprocess.PIPE`, you *must* drain both buffers. You only drain one in the sample code above (`file.write(output.stdout.read().decode("utf-8"))`). If `stdout` is not drained, subprocess will hang waiting on output to become ready.
I tried: `output = subprocess.Popen('systeminfo', [stdout/stderr/stdin stuff], shell=True)`, butI can't provide a list on the second place. When I use without `stdin=subprocess.PIPE` it also is just stuck at the same line. It is almost like it is waiting, but will never finish or remains waiting after it finishes.
Among other things, yeah
For selenium and firefox I use this line os.environ['MOZ_HEADLESS'] = '1'
&gt;stdin=subprocess.DEVNULL How do I know if stdout is drained? I am new to this and saw this in a few examples and did not think this was even necessary. Thanks to your `stdstdin=subprocess.DEVNULL` it will open a cmd window for a few seconds, but it doesnt show anything just a blinking white stripe. it closes, but it writes nothing to the file. So maybe this is beacuse of the stdout isn't drained?
You are draining `stdout`, but I don't know if you are draining `stderr`. Find or add reading from `output.stderr`.

Sys/Net admin for small firm with only minor AWS presence here, started off as a phone jockey and worked my way up in a few years, so my experiences may not directly relate but.... I can highly recommend just learning to automate the ever loving shit out of the easier parts of your job. Need to generate monthly reports or analyse / collate data? Stop doing it by hand. Write something for that. In writing a number of individual scripts I saved myself a load of work hours, made my bosses happy and learned enough about Python to start using it as a real tool for more complex applications. As for "DEVOPS", start messing about with Virtual Environments. You can create entire infrastructures virtually and in doing so you'll likely bump into some of the problems you'd experience in the real world. Experience is experience, even if it was just mucking about by making a virtual corporate network (email / auth / firewall / etc) with a few VMs. Docker. Understand the fundamentals of how to glue two smart phones to a plank of wood to create a "service". Then how to automate the deployment and management of that "service". I found making small Flask apps (python web framework) and learning how to deploy them to be really helpful to come to terms with the basics of how this works and there's plenty of documentation / tutorial out there for it. AWS also offer 1 year free tier for certain size EC2s (t2.micro i think?) and more free tier in other AWS resources. Check it out and maybe mess about with it in your free time. Do keep a careful eye on your free tier service usage though as you can easily be bitten by a nasty bill. Hope this is of *some* help. o/
it returns empty. I trief writing it and putting it inside a tkinter warningbox, but box came out empty. I think it just is empty. It is difficult, because I can't use print to check. Does this mean it drains or that it doesn't?
I use pycharm on windows 10 64 bit, but I use pyinstaller and test the created .exe first on windows 7 32bit.
You visit [/r/learnpython](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython) and ask there. Best of luck!
Please add information about platform support. I just spent half an hour trying to install it - only to find that Tensorflow is not supported on Windows Python 2.7. Sidenote: `feat_extract.py` imports matplotlib (which is not listed among dependencies) - but does not actually use it. 
I'm currently implementing a simple server for interacting with the Raspberry Pi camera over the local network. It's part one of a project of mine, in which I intend to connect a number of sensors in the home to a server where the Raspberry Pi and its camera will be one of the sensors. &amp;#x200B; I'm not really a python developer so this is also a learning experience. &amp;#x200B; Github: [RpiCamServer](https://github.com/ZaoLahma/RpiCamServer)
I don't know. Can't see your code. Instead of using windows, write it to a file, just like with stdout. 
I tried, but it doesn't write anything. It is just a blank line.
Ah sorry, my bad. I did put a badge at the top of the readme that says Python 3.1.0, but it's not the easiest to see. I'll make it much clearer. Also, thank you for the heads up with matplotlib. I'm going to update the docs right now.
I have GTX 940 MX, but I could not install and import numba and pycuda in Thonny. Can anyone help me?
Oops, indeed, I did not notice the badge. But I did look in `setup.py` and that says Python 2.7. 
Oh whoops, yes, you're right. Sorry about that and thank you for letting me know
If you have some sort of infinite loop you could do it like this: prev_time = time.time() while True: # Do something else if time.time() - prev_time &gt; interval: # draw method here prev_time = time.time() I'm on mobile, so please excuse my formatting.
That doesn't make any sense at all.
In case anyone is facing the same problem: https://stackoverflow.com/a/53745136/10050610 Thanks to the guy who answered it!
When it’s a useful library that I haven’t heard of, I say go ahead and karma whore
print("whatever", end='')
I tried, but the game window never even opens, I put print("test") where you said Do Something else and it just kept printing test, not quite sure where you intended the loop to stop. &amp;#x200B; I'm still fairly new to python, so I'm probably not understanding something. def draw(self): prev\_time = time.time() while True: print("Test") if time.time() - prev\_time &gt; 20: self.h = plt.plot(self.position\[0\], self.position\[1\], marker = 'o', color = 'cyan', markersize=self.size)\[0\] prev\_time = time.time() &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; also not quite sure what you meant by interval, so I just put 20 in.
Ok, I have tried running it with [subprocess.run](https://subprocess.run)() and it works! But only on Windows 10 (only tested 64bit now). Weird thing is that it doesn't work on windows 7 32 bit. The os where I create the .exe. I think it might has something to do with the ammount of text it returns. In windows 10 I have about 9 hotfixes and the normal stuff. In windows 7 I have 171 hotfixes (I know by running systeminfo manually in cmd). Do you think it has something to do with that? If so how can this problem be solved?
Minor aside: I prefer escaping newlines with backslashes instead of enclosing chained method calls inside of parentheses E.g. this: ``` pandas.read_csv('data/titanic.csv.gz')\ .query('Age &lt; Age.quantile(.99)') ``` over this: ``` (pandas.read\_csv('data/titanic.csv.gz') .query('Age &lt; Age.quantile(.99)')) ```
Ok, go back a bit. Prepare a simple script that just runs the command and writes output to files. No Tk. Pack it, run it and see if it hangs. If it will work fine, your problem lies somewhere else. 
print([i for i in range(10)]) Should do the trick. However this can get messy if the prints are complicated. You might just be better off with multiple lines. Consider it at least.
Happy to hear they'll get rid of the inplace argument, I always found it confusing. 
Same here! I’m using the last of my work holidays to spend some good time learning it before a good break on the 25th. Then in the new year I’ll be doing some basic VR development.

&gt;"For example, I personally believe that "Visual Basic" did more for programming than "Object-Oriented Languages" did. Yet people laugh at VB and say it’s a bad language, and they’ve been talking about OO languages for decades. And no, Visual Basic wasn’t a great language, but I think the easy DB interfaces in VB were fundmantally more important than object orientation is, for example." This is cool!

We're currently in the process of making a self-trained checkers AI and we couldn't find any great Python checkers libraries, so we decided to make our own. #Create a new game: game = Game() #See whose turn it is: game.whose_turn() #1 or 2 #Get the possible moves: game.get_possible_moves() #[[9, 13], [9, 14], [10, 14], [10, 15], [11, 15], [11, 16], [12, 16]] #Make a move: game.move([9, 13]) #Check if the game is over: game.is_over() #True or False #Find out who won: game.get_winner() #None or 1 or 2 #Review the move history: game.moves #[[int, int], [int, int], ...] You also have the ability to review the state of the board or individual pieces. Would love to hear what you guys think!
I have done that. It gives an error, what is postive I guess. The error is: UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0x8b in position 839: invalid start byte I can't really find how to fix this. I can't do: [output.stdout.read](https://output.stdout.read)().decode("utf-8") because there is no read() I have used [subprocess.run](https://subprocess.run)() because it waits until it is finished before writing, so I was told by someone. Don't know if it is true. Do ou have any idea how to decode it? 
Agreed.
I get what you mean. Let me elaborate on what I meant. The write up is inward. It's looking into the nitty-gritty details of the Python language. There can be another perspective, which is outward. State of Python can also be new the scientific fields (like astropy) that are adopting Python to do their work. Most of these users don't care about the details of the language. They are using what features Python currently provides. They simply make do with the existing features. That perspective is missing from the article.
If you want to see the details of the ongoing \`inplace\` debate among the pandas core team, check out this [pull request](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/16529) on GitHub.
You are using Windows, right? I know very little about this system, but AFAIR it does not use UTF-8 in console. It is some kind of Windows only encoding, depending on the system language. Find a Windows code page for your settings and decode that instead of UTF-8. Please note, I may be wrong. You should consult someone with Windows experience. There is no read() because you used run(). Outputs are returned by this methods as a tuple of strings... or bytes, can't verify it now. Check documentation (http://docs.python.org).
 The problem is this letter ï , I can use decode("utf-8", "backslashreplace") and it will glitch a bit. I will do that for now, because the main concern was getting it to run. I will look into decoding at a later point. I want to thank you very much for helping me. I am verry happy right now because I have been trying to deal with this for two days. Thank you very much /u/kumashiro!
No problem. Good luck!
And here I am, too lazy for any extra characters &gt;pandas.read\_csv('data/titanic.csv.gz' ).query('Age &lt; Age.quantile(.99)') &amp;#x200B;
I'd be happy to see Pandas get replaced by a better option. I'm of the opinion now that it actively harms your ability to do data analysis. Users should not have to know such esoteric rules for things such as subset selection and implicit data alignment. The API is one of the worst designed in the python data science ecosystem with numerous methods that duplicate other methods without providing additional benefit. There is also a tremendous amount of overhead now added on top of NumPy. Summing a single column of data is nearly as fast in pure Python and about an order of magnitude slower than it is in Numpy (I can provide tests for this if someone cares). The code base is also incredibly complex and it takes forever to understand it, so contributing is a very painful process.
Oh god is that the one on Raspberry Pi. I’m sick of it, but then I’m used to Sublime.
Yes, there are still a few properties of the API that need documentation such as retrieving the list of supported parts/regions. As to the latter question, I am not. 
Maybe not hijack unrelated posts?
THANK YOU GOD I ALWAYS NEEDED THIS. 
I approve of people like you! 
Hi! This is going to sound dumb and I guess i'm just trying to put my feelers out there, but: I listened to a recent episode of the Joe Rogan Experience which had Dr. Ben Goertzel and something clicked where I wanted to get involved in the conversation of AI. I simply googled 'how to get into AI' and saw that learning Python might be a good first step. I'm honestly not a big computer user, except for graphics programs for work. I'm really starting from scratch. I was wondering if any of you people had thoughts. Am i being ridiculous?
I have to run into a meeting right now, but have you tried \`obj.\_\_dict\_\_\` might have to inherit from \`object\` depending on what version you're running. dir(obj) is the other builtin I turn to, but it will have more stuff and you'll have to work through some things.

Yeah I had it on my Pi3 too to make quick edits on my scripts. At the time I was used to PyCharm so it was a massive downgrade, but since then I've also made do with IDLE (eww) so maybe I should give it another chance.
Well, he is on the wrong sub
I think I'll stick to my cross-platform VSCode, thanks. It looks nice though!
Pandas is a good tool, but it's not right for every project. I've seen people put data into Pandas DataFrames because they don't know what Python lists and dictionaries are.
[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50606929/how-to-initiate-chrome-canary-in-headless-mode-through-selenium-and-python](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50606929/how-to-initiate-chrome-canary-in-headless-mode-through-selenium-and-python)
Did you open the link? Tempfile sucks for getting a Path (unless you're ok accidentally breaking Windows support and it being a chore to get temp-paths in arbitrary subdirs). Also, I imported it at work just to get a Py2/3 Path, actually. But there's more coming. I plan to also include a Py2/3 recordclass that offers a \_\_json\_\_, and extend Paths with write\_json(). Basically all the things I wish I had when I'm writing Python glue between other scripts or long-running data derivation. Just `CachePath('data-step1.json).write_json(mydata)` and back to thinking about the problem.
Yeah I've tried a few times using those options but I couldn't figure it out. For now I've stuck to creating the dictionary manually, while not ideal, I was spending too much time on this.
You can learn by doing. Try to implement smth like ftp frontend using sockets only. Something like python's http.server module. You can run it with command python3 -m http.server
Nice project. Always cool to see VPython in use. It's a great tool for visualizing complex physics. VPython was recently ported to browsers using a JS transpiler. All the same Python syntax can be edited/ran directly from a web page. It is called Glowscript ([http://www.glowscript.org/](http://www.glowscript.org/)). This was done by the creator Bruce Sherwood and other volunteers. I frequently use it to teach my classes.
I think you are looking for either beautiful soup, or phantomJS, however phantomJS is no longer supported at this moment. It will be tough to decode what went wrong if you don't have a browser present, headless is usually for the pros. You can Pip install beautiful soup on command line from Python.

It is really good for the intent it has—to be a good IDE for beginners.
Looks quite similar to DrRacket. I haven't checked the papers yet because I'm on my phone, but I'm curious whether the developers discuss it as an influence there.
Thanks for the tip mate ill try to remember that.
cool
Good luck! I hope you are using pytest
Why not Jupyter Notebooks? I strongly believe that's the best for learning quickly.
I think that, if you know you are going to build something that either will use unit tests or will consist of more than one file, then you are better off not using Jupyter notebooks at all. Just go straight to using .py files, and use a better text editor/IDE whilst you are at it.
I’m new to writing test so I’ll check that out. I was gonna use unittest. 
I love Thonny. I have been trying other IDE's because the rest of the world is telling me I will love others more, but so far I'm not seeing it. So I have been experimenting and so far I think pycharm is slow bloated garbage, VSCode is designed to annoy me, and Spyder is almost as easy to simply use. You don't have to install a whole integrated python. You can use your current python and just pip install thonny.
Can someone please explain the name?
His examples aren't the best but the sentiment does hold. After using vim for years, using the IntelliJ plugins genuinely feels clunky and out of place. I still use it whenever I start up pycharm (mostly to debug/look at any neat tools they may have), but I can't imagine it actually replacing vim for me.
I imagine unless the use-case really favors Julia, I don't see it ruling in 2019. Many Julia projects still lack support for 1.0.
...and worse yet, when you, the engineer, are tasked with making the code work when yours does c.salsa() and the customer was sold by the marketing department/salesperson that you do c.tango(), c.salsa, and mamba() “is well on its way next quarter!” Meanwhile, three quarters later, and tango() just got added to the roadmap. Next year. Third quarter.

seconded. what do you mean by "add music with basically no effort". Do you know of lidarr?
Cool. I always love reading the details on this stuff
It's a good idea! Also nice exercise. I have a suggestion for improve: Maybe you can add some visual things with tweets. Like location of city. I think would be good If we can see that.
Look for field of type password, and then assume previous one is username, that should get the majority of sites.
Using Notebooks can give confusing results because it doesn't easily show the whole picture of the execution or state. This is especially problematic for beginners who are trying to learn what is going on and can't infer what the computer is doing. There was a good talk at JupyterCon that highlighted this: [Link](https://youtu.be/7jiPeIFXb6U?t=149). 
This is a preference thing, but sometimes avoided because stray whitespace can break the line split, and is easy to miss in a lot of simpler viewers / editors 
Thank you for the link! I shall check it out.
Pretty Cool, I was thinking of doing a similar project, Though I was thinking of using Pygame instead of Vpython for visuals. Any reason you choose to do the visuals in Vpython, and was the implementation easy?
I see we’ve met.
I had heard of lidarr. Looking at it now, it's basically a superior version of what I've made. Mine used Deezer's API and SMloadr to get the songs. It also can convert Spotify playlist to Subsonic.
Much yes
TIL about .query()
Would it be a big problem for the next python to support lines starting with a dot?

As someone who had tried to teach using jupyter notebooks I never managed to get it to work out. There are just so many implicit things about this platform that the newbies just get confused. I usually stick to ptpython or ipython but I tend to teach Unix shell basics first before teaching python. 
Hi. My name is u/derspiny, and I haven't written a single program in over a year. One of the many things I have been in my life is a self-taught programmer and developer in a number of languages, including Python. The only - the _only_ - important thing I've learned in all of that time is that programming is, first and foremost, a social activity. Every piece of code I've written has, in some way, been in service of how I interact with other people. The process of writing software works the same way. It's always a conversation, and it always relies on contributions from others. There's no getting around it unless you built your computer _really_ from scratch - eking out chunks of stone from the ground and refining them into copper and silicon, photo-etching them into chips, building the oven to cure those chips, and soldering them down. Even using Python itself means you are relying on other people, without giving them anything in return (unless you donate to the PSF, in which case, thank you!). I understand the fear of being a leech, and I understand the intense sense of accomplishment solving a problem "alone" can give - but the reality is that you're _not_ alone, and you never were. Even when you never asked for help, you were surrounded by and supported in the work of hundreds of thousands of people, silently and in many cases without a dime of remuneration. It is _completely okay_ to ask for help: you're already getting it. The "beggars" we all complain about are the people who believe that they are entitled to help on their terms, at a moment's notice, for free. Most people - including most r/python regulars - ask for help _all the time_, but they do it in humane and sociable ways that make sure it's not a burden, and they pay it forwards by helping others in turn, either immediately or eventually. It's surprisingly easy not to be a "beggar" and to still get help frequently. I saw in your comments that you're in treatment for clinical depression. I'm proud of you for getting help. Feeling like your work isn't good enough and that you have to quit _can_ be just another way for the depression gremlins to help you tear yourself apart. It's _also_ a problem a fair number of folks in the field have, either due to depression or because of behaviours by others that induce or aggravate imposter syndrome. The reality is, if you're doing this for yourself, then _you need to give yourself permission to feel proud of your work_ - even if it's "some simple GUI app." Keep at it, but _please_ ask for help instead of churning your wheels. Lurking in programming chat rooms (I'm old enough that I did my lurking in IRC) is a great way to participate in a very give-and-take form of helping, as are reddit and StackOverflow. Meetups and conferences are also great if you want to connect with people face-to-face, and at two years in you will _absolutely_ not be the greenest person in the room a lot of the time. I hope you find the mentorship and support you so obviously deserve. I'm thinking of you.

This looks like a spam account. Make a bunch of inane comments in between shilling. 
Did almost the exact same thing except with socket and threading: github.com/aperocky/portscan
I thought an ass only had one port?
The thing is python is so beginner friendly anyway, I think teaching people to be dependent on some ide is not the most productive way.
If you're doing data science, don't worry about it. They are more referencing abuses to suggest Pandas when it's not appropriate (which happens extremely often), i.e.: &gt; How can I average this list of numbers? "Oh, just import this extremely massive dependency with a zillion keyword arguments for every method, and then you just call `df.mean()`!" or like &gt; How do I remove this column from this CSV file? "Oh, just import this extremely massive dependency with a zillion keyword arguments for every method and then read the CSV into a dataframe, drop the unneeded column with `df = df.drop('column_name', axis=1)` and then just rewrite it to the CSV file!" I see Pandas recommended almost every single time someone has a question about CSVs. It's an abuse. Python's `csv` module is excellent.
It already does! :p &gt;&gt;&gt; .0 0.0 
You think using pdb on the command line is productive use of anyone's time?
A lot but not entirely. Here is the related doc on a specific implementation : [https://learnyousomeerlang.com/syntax-in-functions](https://learnyousomeerlang.com/syntax-in-functions) &amp;#x200B; TLDR pattern matching specifically refers to function. case is for control flow.
Very nice question. From [PEP 289](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0289/) &gt; The semantics of a generator expression are equivalent to creating an anonymous generator function and calling it. So I would think not. Can you paste here the diffs of `dir` of both objects? 
Beginners probably don’t need to be using pdb 
Not teaching beginner to use a debugger is a bit daft. 
If you have enough general programming experience to need/appreciate cross-platform support you probably weren't the target audience to begin with. That said blessed be VSCode, it's truly fantastic.

Great post! I didn’t know about NA ints in 0.24, which is great news. Our code uses method chaining extensively, and has done since I read Tom’s article a few years ago. I find the key to easy-to-read long chains is the liberal use of brackets and hanging indents, and keeping line lengths short (definitely no more than 88 characters). We tend to have lambdas in assigns which themselves use method chaining, but if you’re rigorous in your code style it isn’t an issue. (We don’t use black, but our house style has evolved to something every similar.)
Haha, I think Pluto deserves it. I'm hopefully future proofing this post by saying so XD.

Nice to hear. I really encourage you to do your project. There are two reasons I chose Vpython: 1. It is 3D, while pygame is only 2D. 2. It is very easy to use. I basically create a sphere in one line of code and I can change its position in another line of code + it has a built in vector library. It's fun making your own but it's also nice to have a good implementation if you want to speed up your simulation. 
It's fantastic and really easy to use. I have also tried Glowscript and it is really cool. I find that out runs faster there aswell.

&gt; Oh, just import this extremely massive dependency This is exactly why I'm a fan of providing the hooks for pandas in my library, and import it from within a function. Too many people stick all their optional imports at the top of the file.
What is cheap? Normal price $199 and 90% or the time $9.99 only. I would be quite annoyed being a first time buyer and paying 20 times the "normal" price
I do not test it extensively but I confirm it works on Linux. Nice project and congratulations !

Having your own platform is an additional challenge to market your courses. Being in a marketplace makes this a lot easier. But I fully understand your wish to be independent from Udemy. When you start your own LMS platform, make sure your online courses are included in www.elearnscanner.com. Then you have the advantage of having your own platform, but your courses can still be found on a marketplace.
Interesting! &amp;#x200B; When I read your code, it seemed very influenced by traditional threading which leads to some unnecessary complexity. Since you are using 3.7, you can simply take advantage of asynchronous generators rather than using work and result queues. &amp;#x200B; I couldn't help myself, so I forked your code to show another take on the task-&gt;work-&gt;result framework. [https://gist.github.com/emillynge/1eee20e8429caece09774af7e5614d69](https://gist.github.com/emillynge/1eee20e8429caece09774af7e5614d69) (I introduced a dependency on aiostreams) &amp;#x200B; Maybe the code can be further simplified by using a semaphore to limit concurrency? &amp;#x200B; NB: the ipsort is *really* inefficient.
Thank you very much:-) 
The the heavy users of Vs code; what does it do better than pycharm?
i believe you misspelled r/learnpython
Here's the best answer I could find: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1995418/python-generator-expression-vs-yield Both functions should return a generator object, though they're slightly different: ```&gt;&gt;&gt; g()``` ```&lt;generator object g at 0x0000016BCEC27390&gt;``` ```&gt;&gt;&gt; f()``` ```&lt;generator object f.&lt;locals&gt;.&lt;genexpr&gt; at 0x0000016BCEC274F8&gt;``` 
This is useful for transitioning from another IDE, I don’t see the problem? 
As heavy user of sublime text, is it still slow compared to ST? I've tried VSC half a year back and it was slow... And confusing settings. And building. And I setting up shortcuts I had on my ST. How would you compare it? 
I, for one think it's way easier on the eyes after you set it up with your favourite theme and syntax colours. Which takes three minutes at best.
I do not want to point any preference, but to remarks something I experienced last weeks. I have been using vscode a while now. I wanted to start a new project in Pycharm to really use the IDE functionality, and was not a nice time: The default syntax colors with default themes are ugly, and setting them is quite difficult. The linting options by default where not nice, and there was a lot of background delay for just a main script and two local packages (no more than 10 files each). Debbuging was not clear, environments with conda took a lot to detect and activate, some small configs were more complicated to look for and setup (wrapping text, auto align, run specific tasks... Etc. The good thing of vscode is that the defaults work nice, and the config for a specific functionality (either native or via extension) is simple, so you spend time with what matters. It is perhaps not a deep, elaborated argument, but more a personal feeling. But Pycharm did not made my work easier, but the opposite. 
I'm also a noob and I've done this. Compiled a huge json dump into a dataframe before converting it to a csv. This was gigabites of json data. When I skipped pandas and just wrote it straight to csv, my code sped up by more than ten times (and the times were not insignificant with the scale of data I was working with).
Yeah. As a noob I never know whether a method will use inplace or not. Far better to just assign the return to a dataframe.
The cost is a lot lower (free)
Hey there, I'm glad that my feedback can help you out ! If you ever need more explanations or documentation, feel free to PM me !
Our support team are using a standard web app for logging calls etc. It's not ideal so I'm whooping up our own in flask / python and customising it for our exact needs. Should take about a week based on current trajectory. I know there will be support for it down the road, but if I keep it simple, for our needs, I can keep feature creep out of it and hopefully it will serve us well, save us money and give us exactly what we're after
I like jupyter but now I teach python data science with Spyder instead. It's more intuitive for new users to just launch one program instead of a server and browser, and the console and variable explorer are very convenient. It also works better with git.
that is also learning python.
TIL you can put semicolon after a statement.
 Lipsticks are the mainly used commodity in everyday life and the most effective product in the female makeup industry. The packaging of the lipsticks is bound to be as aesthetically bewitching as the lipstick itself. These two are the entities which should never go on separate ways. Quality of the box and the quality of the lipstick product should always be parallel. The [custom lipstick boxes](https://www.thecosmeticboxes.com/product/lipstick-boxes/), which are artistically designed serve this objective in the utmost and total effective plus efficient manner. These boxes are available all over the market in custom sizes and figures. These custom lipstick boxes contain numerous other features as well such as die cut and printed with a certain ornamental and artistic option. 
I use Geany for Python. I really enjoy VS but for Python it feels clunky or like it’s too much. 
Hey there, I got a little question: How do you resolve the starting velocity of the planets?
I use VSC in work, it has improved some. Give it a go.
I have gathered the starting positions and velocities from Nasa: [https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/horizons.cgi](https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/horizons.cgi) 
PyCharm has a community edition which is fine for most people.
Well pycharm CE is also free. Are there any extra features I am missing by using pycharm CE compared to VsCode?
I've used Sublime Text for many years and tried Atom for a month before getting annoyed with it and decided to give VSC a go. Loving it at the moment and I think i won't be switching back.
Well the non-free pycharm features are very likely available as plugins in VSCode.
Thanks, definitely interesting to read! 
VSCode is faster than it used to be, still slower than ST. VSCode settings got a new interface 1 or 2 releases ago.
I was a heavy ST user for quite a while, but I gave VSC a try months ago, and it really hit me, I think it deserves to give it a try too. 
I use VS code primarily as a text editor and use spyder for python( for all my data science work). Does anyone know how they compare?

Do people really set Python to PATH on their dev environment? I've gotten so used to setting that up per session and I think using PYTHONPATH and VENVPATH in VS Code would be a better and proper way. Or is that too much for beginners :O What do you think.
Guys, noob here. Why are there still releases for Python 3.6.8 when the last version is, I guess, 3.7.2? What am I missing here? 
Congratulations 
What im missing is when not to use lists, for example sets are a better choice sometimes

You can install an extension that makes VS Code use ST shortcuts
dask.dataframe (dask itself is too general to compare) and modin (pandas on ray) both build on top of pandas as far I understand. They still suffer from many of the issues Pandas has: [http://wesmckinney.com/blog/apache-arrow-pandas-internals/](http://wesmckinney.com/blog/apache-arrow-pandas-internals/) , especially regarding memory usage and layout. &amp;#x200B; Vaex, on the other hand, is built from the ground up, it is: * Closer to the metal (column based storage, simple fast algorithms). * Arrow and hdf5 support using memory mapping (open a 1TB file in \~0.001 second). * Instead of groupby, has binby, which can generate statistics on a N-d grid at a rate of **1 billion rows per second** * Does not waste memory: e.g. `df['y'] = df.x**2` stored the expression, and would not waste 8GB of ram if your dataset contained 1 billion rows * The expression system has a lot of advantages. * No memory wasted. * Can be post-processed (jitting, derivatives). * Can be stored and inspected, for reproducibility. * Enables remote DataFrames (you don't send the data, you send the expression). Because all manipulations you have done are stored in the DataFrame, you can extract a 'pipeline' from it as what would be common in machine learning. With vaex, you get a pipeline for free. We are working on this in the vaex-ml package, and write an article about that early next year. &amp;#x200B; With vaex you can work with a 1TB file on your laptop, you don't need a cluster.
There is an extension for vscode to [import your keybindings and settings from st](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.sublime-keybindings). 
I really want to be able to like VS Code but I’ve found it doesn’t really compare to Spyder and it’s use in data science. There are some libraries that try to integrate Jupyter notebooks for REPL work but it’s clunky IMO and has the same card paradigm I’m not a fan of. If they were ever able to embed the QT Console and build a variable explorer it’s 💯. 
No need to use classes or inherit from TestCase, just define top-level functions. No `self.assertEqual` stuff, just use the built-in `assert` keyword. [Fixtures are used for setup and teardown](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/fixture.html) - this is basically dependency-injection for your tests. Better test output (though I admit this one is more subjective). Full compatibility with unittest - pytest is able to run unittest tests, so you can mix both unittest and pytest tests, moving incrementally from one to the other.
Jupyter Lab is the key!
If you're expecting a Markov chain to produce a sentence that's both new and meaningful, you're pretty unlikely to get there. It's a very inaccurate model.
Do the planets intersect gravitationally with one another or are they just set to orbit around the sun? 
I would say moreso like, human like and somewhat makes sense. 
You can, but it’s not a good idea. It’s a line separator for putting 2 lines of code on one line of text. 
Not going to happen.
That's what I'm thinking. My teacher is having us build some tweet generator and the only way I can get sentences that make sense are keeping the first few words and then creating random strings appear after that lol 
I do all the time. `import pudb; py.db` to add debuggin 
I've used both. IMO They're not really comparable but it all depends on your needs. VSC: - lightweight. - doesn't want to murder your RAM. - loads much faster. - heavily reliant on extensions. No native Python/debugger support (but very easy to install). - must have `pylint` for debugger extension. - more akin to a fancy text editor. The auto complete are reliable but not necessarily always what you need (it just predicts very good, but can give you entirely unrelated names) - less python specific features. - doesn't auto save your scripts. - doesn't have an interactive console (just terminal). - useful if you have projects requiring different languages, you can open basically anything you need to edit. - More focused on individual scripts than project. - IMO beautiful interface out of the box (though the setting/shortcuts takes getting used to). PyCharm: - heavyweight. - wants to have rough sex with your RAM. - initial load time is much longer. - native Python support, straight out of the box experience. - native debugger, no need for extra modules on your Python environment. - more akin to a full blown IDE, quick and easy auto complete with correct context. - more python specific features. - auto saves your changes. - has a built in interactive session for quick tests along with terminal. - more python focused but have some extensions for extra supports. - easily manage your project structure en suite. - IMO require some tinkering for the interface to look modern.
Pandas is a good tool modulo the fact that they tend to break backward compatibility. Also, they violate some python standard behavior that makes it painful occasionally to teach to others. 
Cool, I'll give it a go. One of my gripes with unittest is that it completely messes up the pylint score. Is pytest ok with regards to pylint/PEP compliance?
You could use more advanced machine learning stuff here if you really want to.
Yeah I figured I could do something like that. This is for a computer science class though and we've mostly built every class and method to get words weighted probability, and create histograms and all of that. So he didn't want us to use any trickery to get it working lol 
Then I guess you'll have to accept that the output is mostly nonsensical.
I'm not sure, I don't really use pylint. What are the PEP violations that you see when using unittest?
What's with all the Python 101 posts in /r/Python lately? I always thought /r/learnpython was for that stuff. I'm not against learning python basics, but I hope this sub doesn't become spammed with hundreds of the same "Hello World" blog posts.
For someone that never used Visual Studio, how is it compared to Pycharm?
The planets do interact with each other. I could add the moon to the simulation and it would orbit the earth. But it isn't entirely true all of the time. I have two kinds of objects in my simulation. I call them "bodies" and "comets". The "bodies" affect all other objects with their gravity while the "comets" do not affect any other body but they are affected by the "bodies". This is handy for small objects with small masses like comets, asteroids and smaller planetoids. The simulation then don't have to do as many calculations and as such the simulation runs faster while losing a tiny tiny bit of accuracy (neglect-able most of the time). In the default configurations file I have the Sun and the 8 planets of the solar system as "bodies" and Hailey's Comet, Pluto and Sedna as "comets". This takes around 10 seconds to run on my computer, with the same settings if I make all objects to "bodies" it takes around 12 seconds instead. That's 20% longer then before. One fun thing I have tested is to add a black hole to the solar system, it had the effect one could have expected: chaos. 
From what I remember it broke things like line length and perhaps variable naming conventions. Don't quote me on that though, as I'm getting back into Python now after ~2 yers hiatus.
Do your own homework 
... but most of what you said also applies to dask. So.. do you have any benchmarks or comparisons?
+1
I used to like Jupyter Lab, but for anything more than a bit of data wrangling for myself it feels clunky and counter-intuitive. Whenever I write a script that I intend to run headless and without interaction from me, Jupyter Lab is just too cumbersome.
Maybe it applies to dask itself, but not the dataframe libraries. AFAIK a dask dataframe does not have virtual columns / expression that are lazily evaluated. A benchmark would be interesting, but they are difficult to compare. Vaex really shines in computing statistics in N-d regular grids, and dask dataframes do not support that (like pandas). Also, vaex' focus is on large datasets, for instance, working with a 25GB (or 1TB) dataset on my laptop, doing filtering, computations and all is no problem. I cannot even open a dataset that large with pandas or dask dataframe, let alone do a benchmark. &amp;#x200B;
There are a handful of big Learn to Code bootcamps that require that you write blog posts or make tutorial videos -- part of the whole "you'll learn a lot by explaining it to someone else" strategy. It's not a bad way to learn, but it's flooding the internet (and related forums) with low-level junkposts. We're seeing a lot of this crap over at r/datascience, too, right now.
Currently majority of networks are configured by hand - a human logging into the network devices and applying changes one at a time. A framework like this can be (and is) used to automate your network. It provides an inventory and task runner abstraction and on top of it, you can build whatever you want: for example some web form for provisioning a new user or a group of users, which after submission will go to your network devices and apply necessary device-level changes.
Decorators are a much easier and better readable syntax for: call this function (decorator) with another function (the decorated function) as and argument and assign the returned function to the original name. You could just write that out: def tmpfunc(): pass func = decorator(tmpfunc) But that is obviously not as elegant(and misses some comfort features, like correct introspection) than: @decorator def func(): pass
I can't tell you how grateful I am for this message. Your words of encouragement/insight are the probably best I've received since starting programming. And I'm going to execute on it and absolutely take your advice to heart. Thank you for this. I guess I don't know what else to say exactly except for that, so again, thank you!
Maybe some clarification: Dask and vaex are not 'competing', they are orthogonal. Vaex could use dask to do the computations, but when this part of vaex was built, dask didn't exist. I recently tried using dask, instead of vaex' internal computation model, but it gave a serious performance hit. I've discussed this with the original dask author (Matt Rocklin) this summer. At that time they were adding the 'Actor' idea into dask (inspired from ray). Maybe this will make it possible to get the same performance. distributed (formerly dask.distributed) would also make sense to support since you could make use of already set up 'dask/distributed' clusters. It would be great to support &gt;10\^10 rows, but for most of our applications, we have at max 10\^9 rows (stars actually, observed by ESA's space satellite Gaia), so a single decent computer suffices.
This was focused on lists only because "Python list" was #2 after "Python" in Google queries, but a common question that I actually cover in my book, which I'll just copypasta here because I hold the copyright and YOLO (this is one of the 4 idioms in the book specifically about sets; please disregard weird formatting as it's an artifact of how I "build" my book): &gt; &gt; &gt;Understand and use the mathematical \`\`set\`\` operations &gt; &gt;\`sets\` are an easy to understand data structure. Like a \`\`dict\`\` with keys but &gt; &gt;no values, the \`\`set\`\` class implements the \`\`Iterable\`\` and \`\`Container\`\` &gt; &gt;interfaces. Thus, a \`\`set\`\` can be used in a \`\`for\`\` loop or as the subject of &gt; &gt;an \`\`in\`\` statement. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;For programmers who haven't seen a Set data type before, it may appear &gt; &gt;to be of limited use. Key to understanding their usefulness is understanding &gt; &gt;their origin in mathematics. \[Set Theory\]([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set\_theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_theory)) is the branch &gt; &gt;of mathematics devoted to the study of sets. Understanding the basic &gt; &gt;mathematical set operations is the key to harnessing their power. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Don't worry; you don't need a degree in math to understand or use sets. You just &gt; &gt;need to remember a few simple operations: &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Union &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;: The set of elements in \`A\`, \`B\`, or both \`A\` and \`B\` (written \`A | B\` in Python). &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Intersection &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;: The set of elements in both \`A\` and \`B\` (written \`A &amp; B\` in Python). &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Difference &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;: The set of elements in \`A\` but not \`B\` (written \`A - B\` in Python). &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\*Note: order matters here. \`A - B\` is not necessarily the same as \`B - A\`. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Symmetric Difference &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;: The set of elements in either \`A\` or \`B\`, but not both \`A\` \*and\* \`B\` (written \`A \^ B\` in Python). &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;When working with lists of data, a common task is finding the elements &gt; &gt;that appear in all of the lists. Any time you need to choose &gt; &gt;elements from two or more sequences based on properties of sequence membership, &gt; &gt;\*\*look to use a \`\`set\`\`\*\*. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Below, we'll explore some typical examples. &gt; &gt;""" &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;class User(): &gt; &gt;def \_\_init\_\_(self, name): &gt; &gt;[self.name](https://self.name) = name &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;jeff = User('Jeff') &gt; &gt;larry = User('Larry') &gt; &gt;moe = User('Moe') &gt; &gt;curly = User('Curly') &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;def get\_list\_of\_most\_active\_users(): &gt; &gt;return \[larry, moe, curly, jeff\] &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;def get\_list\_of\_most\_popular\_users(): &gt; &gt;return \[larry, curly\] &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;def test\_harmful(): &gt; &gt;def get\_both\_popular\_and\_active\_users(): &gt; &gt;\# Assume the following two functions each return a &gt; &gt;\# list of user names &gt; &gt;most\_popular\_users = get\_list\_of\_most\_popular\_users() &gt; &gt;most\_active\_users = get\_list\_of\_most\_active\_users() &gt; &gt;popular\_and\_active\_users = \[\] &gt; &gt;for user in most\_active\_users: &gt; &gt;if user in most\_popular\_users: &gt; &gt;popular\_and\_active\_users.append(user) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;return popular\_and\_active\_users &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;assert len(get\_both\_popular\_and\_active\_users()) == 2 &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;def test\_idiomatic(): &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;def get\_both\_popular\_and\_active\_users(): &gt; &gt;\# Assume the following two functions each return a &gt; &gt;\# list of user names &gt; &gt;return(set( &gt; &gt;get\_list\_of\_most\_active\_users()) &amp; set( &gt; &gt;get\_list\_of\_most\_popular\_users())) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;assert len(get\_both\_popular\_and\_active\_users()) == 2 &amp;#x200B;
**Set theory** Set theory is a branch of mathematical logic that studies sets, which informally are collections of objects. Although any type of object can be collected into a set, set theory is applied most often to objects that are relevant to mathematics. The language of set theory can be used to define nearly all mathematical objects. The modern study of set theory was initiated by Georg Cantor and Richard Dedekind in the 1870s. *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Python/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28
&gt;Also, they violate some python standard behavior that makes it painful occasionally to teach to others. Could you give some examples? I'd like to understand this further, in case it will help me to teach pandas more effectively. Thanks!
No it isnt slow and way more fully featured than sublime text. I love sublime but VSC is my go-to. It's owned by microsoft too and they are doing regular monthly updates. Give it a try, you'd probably enjoy it.
&gt; It's owned by microsoft too This isn't exactly a positive trait to a lot of people. Despite their more recent contributions, MS has had a bad past with open source so people are still wary.
I'm also excited about the Integer NA type, although the [implementation](http://pandas-docs.github.io/pandas-docs-travis/whatsnew/v0.24.0.html#optional-integer-na-support) is slightly confusing, namely: &gt;The Integer NA support currently uses the captilized dtype version, e.g. **Int8** as compared to the traditional **int8**. This may be changed at a future date. Generally, it's best if people don't have to think about details like "what type of integer should I use", though I understand that the pandas team wanted this to be optional for now (thus keeping the default integer type unchanged). At some point in the future, I hope they will make Integer NA the default integer type.
.query() is the method that accomplishes everyone's intuition for filtering a dataframe. It's rather nice.
semicolon ===== Day of Future Past
Python 3.7.2 is now available in Windows app store. This makes the installation more reliable and also comes in with goodies like python added to PATH. pip and idle available globally. This would help in testing the package with different configurations and fixing issues. The other installers will still be available but this makes installation easier. Thanks to Steve Dower for all the work on this. https://discuss.python.org/t/python-3-7-1rc2-and-3-6-7rc2-now-available-for-testing/532/ CPython issue for the initial work : https://bugs.python.org/issue34977
Yeah, I look forward to using it. I'm tired of getting copy warnings for stuff like df['Field1'][df['Field2'] &gt; 100] = 20
I have been a Unix/Linux developer for 39 years and an arch enemy of Microsoft that whole time but have significantly changed my opinion in the last couple of years, most particularly after seeing the introduction of the excellent VS Code editor and Microsoft's commitment to it.
Is this mostly for convenience over the traditional source https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/ ?
With flask and django, decorators behave as the glue between business logic and the routing system. @app.route("/my_path/&lt;int:id&gt;") def get_record(id): record = Widgets.Get("id=?",id) return render("show_record.html", id=id) In this case, `get_record` is stored into a registry somewhere inside `Flask` which handles HTTP requests and will call `get_record`. Another case (apologies spelling is approximate) @memoize def really_expensive(input): return do_some_task_that_takes_minutes(input) In this case, a memoize like decorator would manage a cache for just `really_expensive`. 
Quoting from the original issue : The Windows Store can now install unrestricted apps, which means we can provide the Python interpreter in there. Advantages: * far more reliable installation * can have specific executables on PATH * automatic updates * other apps can act as extensions (with permission), so things like Mu could also become store apps in the future Disadvantages: * only --user installs for pip will work * harder to find/modify installed files I think for a (very significant) subset of our users, this will be a much better experience than downloading our current installer. It also has the advantage of making "Python" appear in searches in the start menu, which will link directly to a one-click "Install" button. 
Vscode is faster but lacks features.
VSCode isn't the same as Visual Studio. To quote from something I said elsewhere: Vscode is faster but lacks features. 
If you specifically want to know how to do package/environment management, look into Pipenv or Poetry - both of those are tools that let you build deterministic environments for your dependencies.
You said this made you want to kill your self. I quipped that maybe your username, svn an inferior vcs was in fact the real reason you wish to kill yourself. 
 class MemoizeExample: def __init__(self, func): self.cache = None self.func = func def __call__(self, *args, **kwargs): #The real memoize in functools would have a dictionary/list where args &amp; kwargs is hashed so different calls would be cached. #In this cache, regardless of args/kwargs, the first call would be cached and return just that result, regardless of arguments. if self.cache is None: self.cache = self.func(*args, **kwargs) return self.cache @MemoizeExample() def expensive(input): return do_something_that_takes_minutes(input) Basically everything in python is a dict/mapping. If a module is called foo.py and imported, it is stored in `sys.modules['foo'] = &lt;instance_of_foo_module&gt;` where `expensive` is really an instance of `MemoizeExample`. Regardless of how many times you `import foo`, there is only one copy/instance. 
The Python extension already comes with an option to run Python files in the terminal, the code runner extension seems unnecessary
Well of course if you have worked in one environment for years, switching to another will feel out of place. The main reason why people like VIM is modal editing. And you can use VIM-like modal editing in pretty much any IDE. So modal editing isn't really an argument vor VIM the program, but for VIM-like keybindings. Now if you switch gears and say that it's not modal editing that makes VIM great but the plugins, then you'd have to compare VIM with all your plugins to an IDE with all relevant plugins, and of course an equal amount of experience in using both. Believe it or not, learning to use an IDE well is not trivial, just clicking around for an hour and concluding VIM is better is not a reasonable comparison. Think of it the other way: I have been using Visual Studio with ReSharper (and VIM keybindings) for ten years. Switching to VIM is literally impossible. Even if I spent days configuring plugins, there would be features missing and stuff that is not as easy as it is with the setup I know. I can say with quite a bit of confidence that people who claim that VIM is better than any IDE for any purpose have simply not used a professional IDE for any serious development. It's just not comparable, and they make a fool of them selves for being loud about it.
well not really, its learning how to install python in another IDE, theres no actual python being taught.
Bro i want to learn as much in-depth as you have learned. What are the resources you used to learn python?
Learning how to set up a specific IDE isn't part of learning a programming language.
PyCharm is a full blown IDE. VSC is a text editor. Unless you’re working on some massive fleshed out projects, I doubt you’re using 99% of the tools PyCharm provides so it’s just heavier and uses more resources than a text editor
In case you're interested: The "Material Theme UI" plugin for IntelliJ has some very pleasing schemes that affect the whole UI and syntax colors.

I'll be honest, I'm too young to remember the days that Microsoft was anti-Linux. But I still know a lot of people who don't trust them because they're worried that this is just the old "Embrace, Extend, Extinguish" tactic all over again. It may be FUD, it may not be, I just wanted to make sure they were aware that stating that VS Code is by MS is enough to turn some people away from a good tool.
No conflict though, since variable names can't start with a number. 
well then why was it posted in /r/python if it has nothing to do with a programming language
You should check out intel's hpat as well [https://github.com/IntelLabs/hpat](https://github.com/IntelLabs/hpat)
https://github.com/sgriffin53/countdown It's a remake of the British gameshow Countdown. It's a pretty simple script and it's kinda fun to play. Though I can't even beat the computer on the easy setting yet.
_learning_ a programming language.
This looks really similar to https://www.bluej.org/ which is for Java, which was a great first IDE when I was learning programming
I see what you mean, and technically you are right that it isn't learning a programming language. However, it is learning how to program in python using a famous IDE. It is part of learning, and it is part of python (in this case). 
That still doesn't explain why to use a set _+in python_. A set is O(n). A dictionary is O(1). Why ever use a set? This is especially true now that dicts preserve order. Also what if you weren't comparing membership of 2 sequences and you just wanted to see if you'd seen some symbol before? Would you use a set or dict?
So what you're saying is that /r/python should be more or less shut down and everything should just go into /r/learnpython because most posts both teach you things(part of learning) and are python related(part of python)?
Usually older versions of things like this aren't just abandoned. If they were then people would be much less likely to use them. On the release page for 3.6.8.rc1 it says &gt; Python 3.6.8 is planned to be the last bugfix release for 3.6.x. Following the release of 3.6.8, we plan to provide security fixes for Python 3.6 as needed through 2021, five years following its initial release. So often there will be a period of bug fix releases for older versions with a much longer period of security update support.
/r/python is for anything Python related that isn't directly related to "core learning of python and python development". Anything that is "required" to learn/utilize python and that people learning python should learn should go to /r/learnpython. Then /r/python should be for anything interesting, news, discussions, interesting blog posts, developments, use cases, user stories, jobs, interesting ways of applying python etc
I've read large sections of the language reference https://docs.python.org/3/reference/index.html Otherwise, tools like [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) with it's integrated symbolic debugger (you can walk through executing/live code) helps see how various libraries actually work. Really it just comes down to doing what you are doing now, asking questions (I HIGHLY recommend /r/AskPython), and to put it succintly just fucking around with programming. I am sick of hearing "Don't reinvent the wheel", when money is on the line or people are depending on you as part of a team, rewriting what already exists is stupid and irresponsible. At home, make all the damn wheels you can while pursuing personal projects. That last point, about personal projects is important. Yeah you can follow whatever is the modern equivalent of Zed Shaw's "Learn Python the hardway" but that is boring and difficult to stay motivated with. Instead, dive into the deep end, run head first into the wall of what you don't know, and focus on just making whatever it is work before trying to make your code pretty. Code elegance and efficiency can be taught but the reasons for them is a bit more nuanced. Last point, for a long time I liked people like Linus Torvald and Zed Shaw because they are assholes who will speak their minds. Granted Torvald can be a bit more measured in his responses while Zed has a serious chip on his shoulder. The people who are annoyed with you asking questions can be valuable resources (who will end up hating you if you bother them enough) but they know what they are talking about. Just don't mistake them for insecure assholes who provide little or no criticism. A CTO I worked with a few years ago had a motto (he may have stolen) "Fail Faster"; you learn a hell of a lot faster by failing then not trying at all.

The posts in /r/python doesn't agree with you that much, there's plenty of 'learning' posts. I don't think configuring VS Code is on the list of things you should learn while learning python. But whatever.
Building an API with Flask
I would recommend using `loc` instead: `df.loc[df['Field2'] &gt; 100, 'Field1'] = 20` The nice thing about `loc` (and `iloc`) is that it always has the following format: `df.loc[which rows do I want, which columns do I want]` [More information here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvpNA7bC8cs&amp;list=PL5-da3qGB5ICCsgW1MxlZ0Hq8LL5U3u9y&amp;index=19), if you're interested in a video tutorial on this topic.
nah fair enough I get what you mean, I don't frequent either subs much so I have no idea why I am digging myself so deep defending my position haha.
Case in point with assholes. Someone downvoted this entire comment chain without comment. They're basically useless as they didn't say "why" they thought what I wrote was stupid BUT I am hoping someone is going to care enough (or be annoyed enough) to suggest why I am stupid. Don't take it personally with the former or the latter case, just appreciate the latter for taking 5 seconds to tell you why you are an idiot.
&gt; A set is O(n). A dictionary is O(1). Why ever use a set if you didn't need the union etc operators? Datastructures don't have a Big Oh, operations on those datastructures do. I don't know of any O(1) operation on a dict where the corresponding operation on a set isn't O(1) as well. &gt; Also what if you weren't comparing membership of 2 sequences and you just wanted to see if you'd seen some symbol before? Would you use a set or dict? I would use a set. Because what would the value associated with the key even be? For example this recursive function: def depth_first_traverse_list(l, seen=None): if seen is None: seen = set() if id(l) in seen: return seen.add(id(l)) for item in l: if isinstance(item, list): depth_first_traverse_list(item, seen) else: print(item) With a `dict` this would be: def depth_first_traverse_list(l, seen=None): if seen is None: seen = {} if id(l) in seen: return seen[id(l)] = ... for item in l: if isinstance(item, list): depth_first_traverse_list(item, seen) else: print(item) perfectly serviceable except that value is completely out of place.

Hello! I just added support for media files in this release. Hope you like it =) 
That's not exactly a good thing for a language :-/
My freshman physics class extensively used VPython but that was before I really understood any programing, let alone python. I am so tempted to install it and go back to redo some of my homework assignments just for fun! I do remember that we were told to so stuff like: from visual import * which makes my blood boil now that I know what it is.

I've actually become *more* skeptical of Microsoft over time. Have you tried using Azure vs AWS? Microsoft still wants to lock you into their proprietary system, they've just retreated to the b2b space for now. I passed on a job opportunity recently largely because their Azure tech stack was such a pita to work with. I was trying to resolve solved problems in "the Microsoft way" which means no control over your tools, connectors, or anything else with good and well-defined open source tools that Microsoft can't compare with. If I can already solve a problem for free then I don't want to have to re-learn how to solve it in a worse way at a higher cost.
I have had 0 luck with CSB the past two drops though I followed the instructions to the tee. It goes to the shop page when drop time hits but doesn't seem to do anything. Twitter page is inactive and no responses from email support–I guess CSB is dead?
Any luck? None for me.
A little graphics integration. I wrote a raytracer and build an integration to allow scripting of materials and shaders. So you can now customize graphical output by inheriting from a "Material" class.
This is a pretty solid breakdown, thanks for this. I use VSCode for VBScripts and Batch files, but Python in Pycharm (or Spyder) is a way easier experience. That said, MS has made some serious strides in improving Python inside VSCode over the last year, so maybe in 2019 it’ll be a reasonably comparable experience.
If you want to make it any more sensible than a simple probabilistic word appendment, youll have to either go and analyse probabilities of bigrams/trigrams in the corpus. Thats ofcourse assuming you dont have a word categorisation in your corpus, with which you could possibly write some simple linguistic rules to obey - effectively a primitive grammar.
VSCode does auto save?
Nitpick but &gt; If you're only going iterate over the items ..., use the Python built-in function reversed(... &gt; If you need the reversed list itself, use the Python built-in function sorted(... I was expecting this to say `list(reversed(...` since it's not mentioned that `sorted(` will sort the list too (might not be obvious to newcomers)
Yes that's not a good practice to use but for some reason it seems to be the convention in the vpython community to make programs compatible with Glowscript
Actually exploring the Python extension options, I saw VSCode can use like 4 other linters instead of Pylint. 
porting a project over from php to flask
MS' programmers are really nice with OSS. Their legal department however, still very dodgy. 
exactly. it's meant more for passing single string scripts to python using -c flag (i.e., `python -c 'print("hello, "); print("world")'`. There's No good reason to use the semicolon in a code file IMO. 
thanks @maartenbreddels for the detailed explanation 
Can you please explain what is going on in the video
Flask gives you more freedom to code what you need while with Django there are files already prepared and you just need to edit (if you want). Personally I prefer Flask.
Flask 4 lyf
From my experience Flask is simpler and will allow you to print things to the screen faster without much set up.
Django is the best!
I do, import pdb; pdb.set_trace() what's the difference?
its in the video description: 1000ish particles are placed on a 100 x 100 grid, these have all the same options/ rules, these have a feed forward sigmoid neural net brain where the connections / weights are saved as dna, only through assexual reproduction with alot of chance on mutation can they multiply. The initialization aka The Big Bang is rough for the first 100 ish frames because it needs to balance itself. These Living Particles can (visible): move,rotate Regenerate (Plantlike), gain health over time while unable to move = blue, Eat (omnivore), cannot eat walls = red, become a Wall (cannot move), regenerate, eat and attack = grey Not Eating, not Regenerating, not Wall = Conservative = Green (loses no health over time, all other states do) All particles, except walls, can attack = do damage, not to walls regenerating + attacking = cyanide eating + attacking = orange conservative + attacking = yellow (again loses health over time) All particles, except walls, can freeze each others movement for 3 frames and the recharge time for this is 5 frames regenerating + trying to freeze = purple eating + trying to freeze = pink conservative + trying to freeze = white green freezing + atacking combined: regenerating + freezing and attacking = light grey blue eating + freezing and attacking = skin colour conservative + freezing and attacking = grey greenish All these larticles can (invisible except in actual program): see a field of view sense inner states yell whisper have a showable state give eachother health save and backprop previous states save another larticles dna and then choose to have a kid of his own dna or the saved dna multiple forms of memory have multiple timers have a sinewave sense in the x and y direction of the grid There are 2 suns in the field that kill larticles. Forms of mutation: 1 connection breaks or 1 connection is new or 1 connection is altered or completely new random mutant 
Not in my experience, perhaps it's a user setting? My default doesn't.
I like VS code more, more customization, tons of plugins, faster. I used Spyder for a while but I didn't really liked it as much, plus I also code in more languages so switching ides sucked 
you can enable it, yes. But it's better to just develop a dirty habit of doing ctrl + S every 30 seconds
what features does it lack?
so what "IDE" features does not VSCode have?
&gt; AFAIK a dask dataframe does not have virtual columns / expression that are lazily evaluated. I'm not 100% sure that's correct; I don't regularly use dask's dataframes (most of my work involves dense multi-dimensional arrays), but if working with dask's integration in xarray, I know that new `DataArray`s aren't eagerly computed. I would imagine that new columns of DataFrames are similar. It's really for your second point that I'm interested (statistics on N-d regular grids), because that's exactly the use case I have in the geosciences and find such success for using dask. So maybe there's a bit more apples-to-apples comparisons that could be done than at first glance? &gt; Also, vaex' focus is on large datasets, for instance, working with a 25GB (or 1TB) dataset on my laptop, doing filtering, computations and all is no problem. I cannot even open a dataset that large with pandas or dask dataframe, let alone do a benchmark. Sure... but you'd probably pre-chunk that data anyways and use something like parquet, right? I routinely work with weather/climate model datasets up to ~10TB using xarray/dask without much difficulty.
This is super helpful - maybe there's a real opportunity for some synergy and co-development here. Definitely worth picking up the conversation on GitHub!
Why not just two lines?
svn is an inferior vcs? Inferior to what, that clusterfuck that git is? Keep googling commands every time you get a cryptic error message, dunce.
Interesting of you to notice; I actually copied the example given by the [docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-queue.html#examples) almost verbatim. This was my first time using `asyncio` so I really appreciate your feedback. I'll take a look at your code, thanks! &gt; the ipsort is really inefficient I know lol. It sure was easy to write though and works like a charm :D
&gt; arch enemy of Microsoft that whole time but have significantly changed my opinion in the last couple of years, F# was the thing that changed my attitude towards Microsoft. Very impressive language - implicit strong typing - compiles to .NET or javascript.. and much more. &amp;#x200B;
Yeah I actually jumped ship over to VSC because I find myself using lots of single scripts instead of full on project, so PyCharm's resource heaviness was unnecessary. Also to my last point I just found VSC was more beautiful, and does most things that I need anyhow so it made it easy to just quickly manage my scripts and get out. That's why I really think it depends on usage. PyCharm is great for a lot of things, but if you only need a quickie don't blow your budget on an expensive date night.
&gt;it's better to just develop a dirty habit of doing ctrl + S every 30 seconds I do that in Emacs subconsciously but I've gotten used to PyCharm just saving everything. &amp;#x200B;
VSCode is the most robust and feature packed text editor and the only big features it has are Integrated Terminal, Package Manager, Debugger, and Git Integration. Just open PyCharm and look at all the other features and tools built in beyond that. I have almost never used any of the tools and features in PyCharm and it usually just feels like deadweight that adds complexity and drains my laptop battery. Like I said, VSCode is easily the most heavyweight and feature rich text editor. Most text editors like Sublime come with nothing but color schemes for languages. For most projects, text editors can do all you need. They are much easier on laptop battery life and much simpler to use and configure.
&gt;I doubt you’re using 99% of the tools PyCharm provides I live by CTRL-SHIFT-F and CTRL-F12 in PyCharm to do searches in a file and my whole project.
Nahh, is more like you actually need to learn django. Once you understand how all the moving parts work, it is pretty straightforward and powerful to customize. &amp;#x200B; If anything the ORM is the biggest limitation, but unless you are working with data science and need really complex queries and such... django will get you there faster, better and in a more secure way than flask
For lazy people who can't be bothered to use `csv` module and just do `list_of_dict = pd.read_csv('csvfile.csv').to_dict(orient='records')` &amp;#x200B; I swear I've never done this...
 You'll get answers that are pretty much 50/50 and that's because there is no real best. They both can do pretty similar stuff. I started with Django and quickly moved to Flask. I like Flask because it is bare bones, but you may like Django more if you want some more stuff handled for you.
I have \`ip\` alias for \`import ipdb;ipdb.set\_trace()\`. Keeping it in one line let's me spare keypresses when removing the line - I'm using shortcut to remove whole line. Can't think of any other reason to keep it in one line.
&gt; automatic updates Please no...
Yeah I know but I like to highlight it as something MS is doing right.
These exist in any major text editor. This is in Sublime Text as well as VSCode. I’m pretty sure there even exists a Vim Plug-in to do exactly this. You don’t need an IDE to search a project 
Gunicorn is just the tunnel from the internet to your local instance, if you are using some other proxy like nginx you do not need it anymore, or if you are exposing it directly to the internet you don't need a tunnel or a proxy at all. 
I think it's disabled by default, but I think it's the first setting option 
Doesn’t work yet if you fork directly from the open source. Needs adjustments but mine worked today for goretex parka after implementing my own code, not great tho as it took 17 seconds.... 
They can pry Vim and Sublime Text from my cold dead hands. I’m already sending enough “metadata” to Redmond as it is.
next up: vim or Emacs, which one is the best editor? 
[Pudb](https://pypi.org/project/pudb/) is a third party package. It’s nice and it makes it difficult to use languages that don’t have something similar (I haven’t found one that quite matches, I love pudb :)
Exactly
Ease to toggle/on off I guess
evil mode &gt;:)
Now you do give up some of the freedom and bare bones but I always wonder how people compare `flask-admin` and `django`.
Much to the chagrin of many here. They belong on /r/learningpython but people just keep putting them here. Check the sidebar.
&gt;I know that new DataArrays aren't eagerly computed. I would imagine that new columns of DataFrames are similar. Interesting, I guess there is some cross-pollination of ideas as well. &gt;It's really for your second point that I'm interested (statistics on N-d regular grids), because that's exactly the use case I have in the geosciences and find such success for using dask That would be interesting to see benchmarks on. &gt;pre-chunk I'm not a fan of chunking, I don't think disk chunking and memory chunking should be related for cache reasons. I'm using hdf5 or arrow and memory map those, much simpler. Though with arrow support (which also has parquet support), I could start looking at parquet.
The general consensus (from my experience): * Personal web server with small traffic -&gt; Flask * Scalable project with heavy traffic -&gt; Django However, there are reasons to consider both in any situation. &amp;#x200B;
Absolutely, would be interesting to share some benchmarks as well, feel free to contact us.
Why not just open a python/iPython environment in the integrated terminal for REPL?
Shouldn't dictionary-type stuff go into a Series if you're gonna be using Pandas?
&gt;I see Pandas recommended almost every single time someone has a question about CSVs. It's an abuse. Python's csv module is excellent. I disagree that importing pandas for manipulating tabular data is an abuse. It's really good at what it does and the import time is insignificant for my needs.
Atom + power mode stands above the rest.
If you can't install visual studio code you are almost certainly brand new to coding and probably computers in general.
I haven’t figured that out. I got REPL to kind of work using the standard Python interpreter but sending blocks of code resulted in the interpreter requiring me to press enter again for it to actually submit. AFAIK you can’t embed the Qt iPython console in VS Code such that’d you be able to visualize charts etc. 
So do you think this type of content belongs here? I certainly don't. This is a subreddit for python discussion. If you are having trouble installing Python and VS Code then there are plenty of subreddits to post that in but this is not one of them.
`df.assign()` is already there. I use it when chaining methods together, and if I have a column name that I want but can't have as a keyword argument, then I'll use a different name and have a rename right after.
So go to /r/*learn*python if you want to learn python. If I went to /r/math and asked for help learning to count they would downvote me. If I asked for help making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich on /r/foodporn they'd downvote me. So why is it a constant struggle with /r/Python to stop getting people to post the most beginner stuff to the sub?
And it couldn't be simpler with a dict writer!
No of course not. You're strawmanning because you're upset. Most likely because you're the type of person who found this post useful and informative. That's fine, nothing wrong with that. But there are a lot of people here who are very good at Python, good enough that they chose to join a community around the subject. All posts relating to learning Python being in learn python. Why is that wrong?
Depends entirely on what you're trying to do. There's no one size fits all.
Very cool! 
I agree if you already have pandas installed or are often working on tabular data. But it does not make sense as a suggestion for a one off probably problem if you're not at all interested in numerical or data science work. Not every Python developer has a virtual environment sitting around with numpy and Pandas.
I think django is for more experienced python users and web devs. It is for building high level apps and for people who are still newbies in web and Python(especially me), Flask is better
Pandas is coming out of 0.X and into 1.0. This change will come with non-breaking API changes within each major release unless something is seriously screwed up. So, once 1.0 comes out, you can rest a bit easy there :)

There are plenty, more interesting python web libraries out there nowaday. The ones that take advantage of Python's asyncio tend to have orders of magnitudes more throughput than Django or Flask.

Just fyi, for anyone who doesn't know. Automatic updates are a Store feature. [You can disable it](https://support.microsoft.com/en-ca/help/15081/windows-turn-on-automatic-app-updates), but only globally (afaik). Meaning you can't enable/disable automatic update for each app, which is a shame.
I think VSCode is a IDE that you have to customize by installing the plugins with the features that you need, with IMHO is better than having a complex IDE using a the ram with half of the things that you will never use
I’m at a similar stage to you but I’ve heard “automate the boring stuff” is a good start point, best of luck :) 
Will this install the Python Launcher as well?
Ah, fair. Yeah, you won't get embedded charts. I just use plt.show() etc. to show a plot window. As for sending blocks of code, you can either just copy the code and use the %paste magic in an ipython terminal, or I've configured my keybinds to execute "Run Selected Text in Active Terminal" when I hit ctrl + enter. It's a little bit round-about, though, and no plot pane is definitely sad, so I can understand just sticking with Spyder.
You have to check for a coma *before* you convert it to a float. numberstr = input('give a number') if ',' in numberstr: # do whatever, presumably remove the comma from the string number = float(numberstr) # rest of your code --- If you have more questions like this it's better to post them on /r/learnpython. Be sure to [format your code for reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/faq#wiki_how_do_i_format_code.3F) or use a site like pastebin. Also, include which version of python and what OS you are using. 
When you \`pip install\` something executable it gets added to the \`Scripts\` folder which is not on the \`PATH\`. Is this an over-site of the installation or are users expected to add the directory to the \`PATH\` variable themselves?

My response is colored by my own use cases, and is more to query Flask users for what they use it for but... to build a website, whether it uses a template system, or a REST-style interface, several of the features Django includes are very common: a database ORM with migrations, authentication, admin, email. You can add these to Flask, with varying degrees of friction between the components, and once you do, the structure resembles Django's, and loses the befits attributed to Flask. Flask-users: What's your take on this, and do you use it for something other than what I've described? &amp;#x200B; Context: I've been trying to set up my next backend server using Rust, which offers several Flask-like Frameworks (eg-Rocket) that are quite nice, but I can't figure out how I'd use it for a non-trivial site due to lack of the features I listed above.
I'm learning python for fun and this (and your molecules program) are right up my alley. I can't wait to dig through the code. I already see lots of things that I want to learn how to do myself. Thanks for sharing 
It's about setting up a specific IDE, what's that got to do with learning python?
And here I thought this subreddit was about which webframework to choose, or to find out how generators work. Silly me. 
OpenCV is a useful library for image processing like that. 
If I started something from scratch today, I'd go for [aiohttp](https://aiohttp.readthedocs.io/en/stable/web.html)
Thanks! I'm be sure to check that out.
A realistic place where on-disk chunking is critical is if you store your data in object storage on the cloud. Dumping a TB hdf5 file in such a system is an antipattern, regardless of how it's chunked internally - you bottleneck your I/O because of how the cloud storage actually operates. So I agree and disagree... When you can get away with one massive file, great! In practice there are many places where this model breaks down.
I would love to work on web crawling projects I’m looking to improve in that area would you be able to help me?
you can keep the JavaScript, I'll use the true patricians editor, NeoVim. Or a magnetic needle on a disk!
I would change the art style of wildcards. You are hovering dangerously close to the suit from Mattel (...or what was that company) and/or Ubisoft. Better safe than sorry. 
You and your fancy tech. The only reason I switched to atom was because my arms were getting tired from manually tearing holes in my homemade papyrus.
Can the csv function read in .gz files? What are the \*\*kwargs options?
I prefer Atom+Hydrogen. All the benefits of a text editor and Jupyter Notebooks. If you like Spyder you can also check Rstudio with Reticulate.

csv reading is being handled by pandas, and I'm not sure which kwargs you mean, feel free to open an issue on github [https://github.com/vaexio/vaex/issues](https://github.com/vaexio/vaex/issues)
Oh, ok - I know the pandas function Your docs mention **kwargs, that's why I asked: https://docs.vaex.io/en/latest/api.html#vaex.from_csv
No
Why not ?

I build a command line utility to geolocate IP addresses. My use case for this is from the context of security investigations where I'm using lots of CLI utilities. There are loads of places on the web to easily geolocate IPs, but I wanted a quick and accurate tool that I could use without having to leave the command line, and whose output could be used on its own or could be piped into another utility. The result is `igg`: [https://gitlab.com/nxl4/igg](https://gitlab.com/nxl4/igg).
If python 3 is so good, why is there no python 4??? 🤔
I have just started learning python! My goal is to build a simple, automated web scraper which scrapes financial data from the web a couple of times per day and poops it out somewhere. Just bought a Udemy course and away i go!
yes, those are forwarded to pandas, maybe that should be mentioned more explicitly.
Some one with experience please explain this

The biggest reason I use VSCode is so I can open up our projects development environment directory in it and work on all of the different microservices (python, JS, PHP, docker, etc) in the same editor. 
They're working on it already =)
P2 will be supported through 2020, don't know if that means Jan 1 or Dec 31. In any case the Python world is still digesting P3 so it might be a while.
When programming sometimes you need to keep track of values that change over time. This is called state. Some values on the other want are just used once. To organize this state we arrange it and place it inside objects together with methods that access this state. This make it easier to understand what happnes to this state. Some functions depends upon state (method) but some don't (static methods). By splitting up methods that change state from those that don't it becomes easier to understand your code. If you want to know what can change your state, or what results depend upon state you just look at the non static methods. But this doesn't come for free. You don't necessarily know what depends on state and what doesn't. And sometimes splitting out statics methods makes things more complicated. Sometimes using static methods means you have more parameters. 
Could you define "far more reliable installation"? I have yet to see a failed install of good ol' python win installer. Automatic updates sounds like a very bad idea... How are you planning to manage other "apps" dependencies in the system install of python? And what about multiple versions of python? Honestly this sounds like a rushed mess, potentially very confusing and frustrating for newcomers. I cannot see any pros for this from the description you gave.
Honestly it wasn't that long ago :) 
GIL? anyone?
It all depends on what you're trying to achieve. Given a desired end state, best practise will be whatever gets you there while preserving your sanity, unless some workflow is imposed on you. Python's ecosystem is rich enough that you'll be sure to find something you can wrap your head around and work with. After that, and armed with new knowledge, you'll naturally progress to the next step, if the need arises. Don't worry about adhering to a "standard".

Well, that example is taken from the Queue page of the aio docs, so it's an example of how queues can be used rather than a best practice for concurrent aio workload distribution. But I also think they choose a fairly poor example at that - you could have popped tasks off a list instead of using a queue for what the example is doing. It's important to remember that asyncio only "parallelizes" I/O, *not* computations. So unless the task production somehow involves IO *and* runs concurrently with task execution, then nothing is gained by using a queue. Maybe I will rewrite their example tomorrow when I'm on a PC to better show what I mean.
This is basically how Atom works too, btw. 
Four spaces, use comments compulsively, descriptive function names, use a virtual environment. That's pretty much it. Am I missing anything anybody? I haven't looked into poetry yet but I hear it is awesome.
well Atom eats all my ram without any plugin
For something like this, I would use a normal function instead of a class. ```python def multiply(x, y): return x.number * y class Foo(object): def __init__(self, number): self.number = number foo = Foo(3) foo.number = multiply(foo, 2) ```
Looks like plaintext-based assert keyword replacement 
These don’t do the same, one mutates the object and one doesn’t. It totally depends on your needs but I’d lean towards implementing __mult__ or whatever it’s called instead so that you can write ‘obj1 * obj2’. If the class represents something mathematical like a coordinate I’d return a new instance 
Hey I use thonny!
Depends. A lot of times you don't even need to set anything extra if your imports are structured right. Virtual environments solve many of those problems too. 
Nice meme
We only really have Python 3 because of need for non backwards compatible changes.

Thanks! I use RStudio a lot. I knew about Reticulate but haven’t messed around with it yet. This might be some motivation. 
Within PIL there is the ImageStat module, with that you can get the average of an image directly. It likely to be quicker, but I haven tested it. 
Yes.
&gt; VBScripts and Batch Dear God, do yourself a favor and learn PowerShell! 
Jeff, I bought your book but never got an update. I tried emailing you. You must be busy. Is the book available for previous purchasers? Thank you!
Part of my says this looks really cool. Part of me does not ever want to debug code inside a docstring.
I’ve taken a look at it, but it seems to be more suited towards systems administrators whereas I’m just an analyst. I only need my scripts to pull some data, format it in some excel sheets, and then distribute those reports through my email (or copying files to shared locations and emailing out the links.) I don’t know if powershell does that kind of stuff as easily, but I just haven’t been ready to make the effort to learn it. I’m hopeful that learning python would adequately replace anything I do in VBScript and .bat files, as well as facilitate even more beyond that. Would be nice to work primarily in one thing.
The problem is when it's done throughout code in lots of places. It slows down readability, maintenance, increases potential for bugs, etc.
You're going to get comments to visit /r/learnpython for how-to questions. I've used openpyxl for Excel, it will read .xlsx files and is fast enough for "normal" spreadsheets. It's very slow for huge spreadsheets. YMMV. You can search for python OpenXML powerpoint libraries, I saw a few on github.
Dude. You're missing out. There's a Powershell module that handles Excel sheets. Import-Csv comes in the box. You're likely missing out on a hold world of ease by not using Powershell! What's an example of something you're doing? I may be able to help.

Want to build a specific CRM for the home improvement industry. Is python a good language to build it in? Learning still
Hey, I had never heard that there was a module for excel, that sounds interesting. My longest-running project is probably a script that runs each morning, refreshing a pivot table linked to another file, adds in some values values from another file and queries a bit of data from a sql connection, then selects a range of that data based off the date, and throws it into a formatted workbook. That final workbook is then distributed (copied to a networked folder and emailed through my outlook) to a defined distribution list. It’s this formatted file that is given to the recipients so that they do not end up accessing any of the other data we have stored in our larger file. The stuff I looked at for powershell usually seemed to be for system admins creating a bunch of new user accounts, or grabbing some specs/details from a ton of users on a network or something.
The python 3.7 C ABI is incompatible with. 3.6's one. Thus, it's a gentle thing to provide updates for both until people migrate to 3.7 since upgrading from 3.6 to 3.7 is not as easy as it sounds. Especially in corporate environment. 
&gt; I'm not against learning python basics, but 1. People who start learning Python and know of Reddit are going to wonder at some point, "Say, I wonder whether there's a Python subreddit?". They will naturally type in /r/python. Nobody on the planet is going to **guess** /r/learningpython, and therein lies the problem. 2. There's /r/pythonnews and /r/advancedpython that were created earlier this week or last week when this topic was brought up. What should happen is that /r/learningpython should become /r/python and all the python stuff more in-depth than learning it should go to one of those other subs. No matter what you, the mods, or I think on the subject, point #1 *is never going to change, ever* no matter how much we might wish it would.
It's definitely focused on being a shell and on system administration, but you really should not be using VBScript in 2018. PowerShell is a 100% .Net environment. The syntax is a bit weird compared to C#, but it's basically an interpretive C# environment. Nearly anything you can do in C# you can do in PowerShell, and you have full access to the entire .Net Framework. But, yeah, for what you're doing, I'd take PowerShell and install the following modules from PowerShell Gallery: SqlServer and ImportExcel. Additionally, if you need actual Excel automation, well, [it can do that, too](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/heyscriptingguy/2006/09/08/how-can-i-use-windows-powershell-to-automate-microsoft-excel/). You can import Com Objects with PowerShell and use those. And, of course, check out /r/PowerShell.

Yeah, I initially started looking into python specifically because of how much of a pain it was to figure out VBScript from scratch. Like, every problem I google for VBScript only generates results for VBA. And while it is similar, i never figured out how to consistently translate it to VBScript. So I got my projects to a point that they work fine, and left it there; I haven’t built on to it yet. I don’t have any background in C# so I probably won’t have to worry about confusion there, I’ll just be picking it up from the ground up. Thanks for the advice, it sounds like it’s definitely worth me looking into it.
Where does Pyramid fit in?
I often use it in IPython for graphs plt.figure(); plt.plot(stuff) That way I am always creating a new graph instead of over writing an existing one. 
Flask can run via gevent. 
Who is Jason and why do you want to upload him? Lol. Just kidding.

It sort of is in the simple cases. However, I was aiming for it to be valuable especially when you have lots of optional parameters to functions. Additionally, the DSL can be "compiled" into objects which you can use in forms and serializers as well as compose together. 
Well the advantage of C# is that it's very popular, and you can often take C# code and port it to PowerShell. Python is faster than PowerShell, but PowerShell is far beyond batch or VBScript.
Umm.. Or you know. Tag stuff

Just finished a simple script that graphically shows air quality percentage from a bme680 sensor on a raspberry pi using a led add on shim. It changes colour every 10% in order to show the data at a higher resolution as it doesn't vary more than 10% unless I'm spraying something or soldering. Tomorrow going to start on a web scraper to grab tide data and display it on a simple and hopefully attractive GUI.

Welcome to Schrödinger's bug, they happen... or they don't, it all depends on your perspective
I'm not on a new enough version of Windows (17763+), the message that I couldn't install is incredibly confusing and it took me several minutes to figure this out. Not Python's fault, but any documentation that links to this should probably mention what Windows build you need to be on and how to check because Microsoft isn't doing a very good job.
Look up the decode method https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bytes-objects you'll probably want to decode your bytes to a utf8 string. Going from string -&gt; bytes used the encode method.
I use sets most often when: * my primary purpose is to test inclusion (e.g. if x in myset) * I want only unique elements * I want to use operations like intersection, union and difference Notably, inclusion tests can be much faster when using a set vs a list.
Formatting is broken.

If you are using `staticmethod`, you're [probably writing Java in Python](https://dirtsimple.org/2004/12/python-is-not-java.html) and [writing too many classes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9pEzgHorH0). For a very long time, `staticmethod` was unique as the only builtin function that had *no uses* in the standard library. (That might even still be the case, I'm not sure.) For a while, Guido talked about `staticmethod` being a mistake that shouldn't have been added. Static methods are weird. Yhey have no access to their owning instance (`self`) or class. So why are they part of the class? It can only be for encapsulation. But if they're private and only used *inside* the class, then why care that they are static methods? Just make them ordinary methods. And if they're used *outside* of the class, then the argument for encapsulation is a bit weak. Perhaps it ought to be a global function. Bottom line is, static methods have *very little* (but not quite *zero*) justification for existing. The only excuse for them is when you have a function but you want it to be accessed from a class using a dot. But why do you want this? 
Read the sample code more carefully. They both mutate the object.
Dumb question: If you are using node as the server, why are you using sockets directly? Surely it can do an application-level protocol of some kind that will make this easier. 
Lexx and yacc will be much easier for you. You have some decisions to make about how to translate, but starting there will serve you well
Isn't it a cat lol
Heisenbug
Not a dumb question at all! If you can't tell, it's my first time dealing with sockets :). Basically the reason was a vague sense that it would be faster, + what I now suspect was an unreasonable disdain for the boilerplate of most protocols. "I'm literally just sending text, how hard could it be?" was the thinking, but I guess I underestimated the value of enveloping.
JSON isn't a message passing protocol, it's a (meta-)data serialization method. Have some header structure to your messages that indicate, for example, how long you JSON bytes encoding is. Then you know how many bytes to read from the socket. 
Fair enough.
Check out [https://github.com/webmaven/python-parsing-tools](https://github.com/webmaven/python-parsing-tools)
Here's an example of one approach - [http://pbpython.com/creating-powerpoint.html](http://pbpython.com/creating-powerpoint.html)
I absolutely understand where you are coming from. The problem is, TCP alone isn't going to tell you how many bytes to read. If you know just one "thing" is being sent, you could just read more bytes than the largest package you'll ever get. (i.e read 1024 if everything is always smaller than that.) The number of bytes is a max, not a min. But if it's sending a stream, you could easily get all 900 bytes of one "thing" and then the first 124 bytes of the next "thing". That's why application-level protocols exist. If you are writing both sides, this is easier to control.

Probably some random occurance triggered iCloud to stop syncing, maybe your internet dropped, or the server reported as offline for a bit and it went inactive until some scheduler decided to kick it off again or it noticed a lot of activity in the folder and decided to hold off sync until it could batch a bunch of updates or maybe your internet was in use and it decided to wait. On a funny note, when I saw the title of your post my first thought was that it was a post from r/nosleep.
One simple way to handle this is to make the Node server close the socket after it sends each "message", and then reopen the socket for the next message.
&gt; use comments compulsively Hopefully your code doesn't *need* that many comments because of... &gt; descriptive function names
Yep, I got that. But there are various ways in Python that I see people abusing PEP 8 all too often, just to save a line or two or a few keystrokes, e.g. max_items, x, parts, items, a, k, g = 200, 2000, 10, ['foo', 'bar'], 99.9, 5, -10 ... for part_index in range(max_foo * 20): print(part_index * 500 / barbar )
This whole post has been 97% of my job for the last two years. "Hey /u/10k44 can you write a script to do xyz123abc?" "Yeah sure....here it is" "Oh thanks we dont need it anymore" THEN WHY DID YOU ASK
Yeah, that might work. Unless the json can contain newlines....
You should always tell someone looking at your code what it does and how to use it.
You're right, I didn't see Bar.multiply_number. Although I don't know why you would ever need both, it looks odd to me to call the static method from the instance method but I guess there is nothing inherently wrong, in any case it's a contrived example.
Thanks for this, can't wait to try it out!
As a junior developer I once spent a good two or three months (part-time while performing other duties) working on a new Call Coaching module for our business's in-house app. When I went to deliver it to Training/QA the person in that role had changed. The new person wasn't interested in the module (not even to look at it) and just kept using Excel spreadsheets. It was a great learning experience at the time. Included building custom controls for VB.NET.
Thanks for the vid, I like the code runner extension very helpful. I also got triggered by the semicolon until reading the comments, I could why he might've been used to using it in python, **OR** maybe his preferred language uses them all the time like C++. 
whats going on? why won't you message me back about my bot? If you can't do it just refund me?
Have you searched C:\Python37\ to make sure there actually is a pip.exe? Open a command prompt in whatever directory it shows pip.exe is in and try there. If that doesn't work, something might be wrong with the Python installation.
&gt; This whole post has been 97% of my job for the last two years. I had a lost year like this as well. Every major project I worked on got canceled. I started to feel cursed.
The program’s purpose is to solve the problem. Now the problem is gone. Did you use the program or not? Doesn’t matter. The initial problem is solved anyways.
Have you tried "py -m pip install X"? If "py" doesn't work, try "python3" instead.
I vote for this. For me: C:\\Users\\david\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python37\\Scripts and C:\\Users\\david\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python37\\
Thanks for the feedback. I just checked my folder and yes, pip.exe is in the C:\Python37\Scripts folder. I tried typing in the address before the command and it worked somehow: C:\Users\[user]\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python37\Scripts\pip install [module] Thanks for the help!
Like I said, I've tried every combination of 'py', '-m' and 'pip' I've seen but no dice. Thankfully I fixed it. (Notes edited in the post). Thanks for the feedback anyway!
I have no idea what you mean... `len([0] * a [0] * b)`
Oh, wanted to also point out something I learned from a PySimpleGUI user not long ago.... using lambda expressions to shorten window definitions. For example: ```python T = lambda text, key=None, font='Helvetica 16', **kwargs: sg.T(text, key=key, font=font, **kwargs) ``` This statement allowed me to use this window definition: ```python col_players = [ [OvalButton('Quit', greenbutton, key='_QUIT_', visible=False)], [T('Player', '_P1_', text_color=yellow_color)], [T('Cards', '_C1_', text_color=yellow_color)], [T(' ' * 15)], [T('Player', '_P2_', text_color=red_color)], [T('Cards', '_C2_', text_color=red_color)], [T(' ' * 15,'_S3_', visible=False,)], [T('Player', '_P3_', visible=False)], [T('Cards', '_C3_', visible=False)], [T(' ' * 15, '_S4_', visible=False,)], [T('Player', '_P4_', visible=False)], [T('Cards', '_C4_', visible=False)],] ``` Each one of those Text Elements would have looked like: ```python [sg.T('Cards', key='_C4_', font='Helvetica 16')] ``` The downside to these is that you lose the autocomplete functionality for the parameters for the underlying call. The amount of typing it saves is pretty awesome. Has a way of really simplifying the code down. It's like a mini-SDK within an SDK.

Lolz everything is just sending text. How experienced are you with REST and using the requests library? If I’m sending JSON those tools would be my first choice. 
I once had to deal with an issue where archived emails couldn't be deleted without hitting "OK" in a separate pop-up dialog box for each email, and I had thousands of emails to delete. Ended up learning two things that day: 1. pyautogui has a fun and simple API that makes automating little tasks like that pretty enjoyable. 2. If you accidentally hit cancel while the script is about 20% of the way through, it will cancel all of the pop-up dialogs and instantly delete all of the emails. Sometimes it happens, but it gave me the chance to learn something new, and I had fun making the project. Just try to enjoy that you came up with a solution to a problem, and be willing to laugh at the situation.
If you're looking for something slightly easier try websockets instead. 
There is never a good use for static methods. Just use a function. Class methods are almost always pointless, but static methods are always pointless. Never use them. 
Preach. 
It definitely feel snappier now, thanks for looking into that! Since I have you attention, what would be the best way for me to modify the contact_list demo so that I can start editing the selected contact with the enter key instead of tabbing to the `&lt;edit&gt; &lt;delete&gt; &lt;quit&gt;`menu first?
Case matters: `import pymysql`.
It might be installed for Python 2 and not 3. You can check the libs folder to see if it's in Python 2 or 3.
Do you understand the responsibilities the position will require you to do on a daily basis? Do you meet the requirements as listed in the job post? &amp;#x200B; That is a advanced position that will require more than just a few months of python development. The position will require knowledge in other areas which include " distributed systems testing, networking, object oriented programming, virtualization software, and building/automating clouds". I recommend you research and understand the different areas that are listed in the job posting. &amp;#x200B; Send me a pm if you have any questions or concerns. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
There's also a good talk here where they go more in depth on coding with python in VSCode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YLMWU-5H9o
Hit cancel as in accidentally stopped the program? Or hit cancel on the pop up?
Didn't work.
i have done it with pip, pip3. I've run it as root as well. I set up a virtual env and it still fails. This is the case with every package, by the way.
I think there's a miscommunication. I'm aware this is an advanced position and will certainly involve more than my few months. What I'm trying to convey is what are some topics I should include so that eventually whether it be 12 months or 24 months I'd be setup for such a position? &amp;#x200B; I'm very versed in networking, virtualization, and cloud architecture. The reason this position is attractive to me is it combines networking with programming. Rather than just learning Python day by day I want to set myself up with a end a goal. So that way I can really focus my time and efforts to end up eventually where I'd like to be. 
Hmm..tried reinstalling Python altogether? Sounds like something is wrong with where Python is trying to look for site packages

Was trying to match values using fuzzywuzzy, which is a pattern matching library. Its crazy slow though unfortunately and its making me start to dislike python.
Machine learning libraries are keras and OpenCV for example - Though this sounds more like a database where all your Details are keys and you query for that. Machine learning is for example used in analysing x-ray images but that's not really a beginner task

I'm on ubuntu. Reinstalling python is fraught with danger.
Inclusion tests in a tuple or list can also be faster than a set if N is small.
What are you talking about?
the destination variable needs to be on the left side of the assignment operator (=)
Jesus i just saw some horrible bad habits in my code. fixed them but no cigar... Current code: &amp;#x200B; UnitType = input("Conversion Type: ") n = float(input("Number: ")) &amp;#x200B; if UnitType == 1: n \* 1.904 = float(z) print(z) elif UnitType == 2: n / 1.904 = float(z) print(z) else: print("Wrong Input") &amp;#x200B;
Sorry again... new to python and coding in general. does this mean that i should be doing something like this?: &amp;#x200B; float(z) = n \* 1.904 &amp;#x200B; thanks for the advice aswell
I contribute to this project: https://github.com/Jamonek/Robinhood I know it isn't nearly as feature-rich as possible and seems close-ish to the scope of your interests. Learning how to solve problems independently is a big part of improving -- have you done much formal learning in Python? Have you learned any other languages?
I am definitely checking this out, after this statement. I have huge datasets I work with that my travel laptop just cannot handle with pandas.

It's easier then it seems on Wikipedia. I basically have a list with all the bodies in my system which i loop over and inside I loop over them again to get every pair twice in opposite order and calculates the total force on a planet. I then get the acceleration by dividing the total force the mass. Then I just integrate all planets velocities and positions using Eulers method. I've been planning to write a tutorial on how to do this but have not had the time to do it because of school. Now in Christmas though I will try to get it finished hopefully.
In case you fixed it but don't quite get why: the `=` just isn't a mathematical "equals" operator. It's not telling Python to keep track of the expressions on either side of it and ensure they always are equal (as if a system of equations) -- instead, the `=` operator stores a *single value* (from the right-hand side) to a *name* (on the left-hand side), and, for this reason, the thing on the left always has to be a single-word variable name rather than a full expression. To further drive that point home, consider the following code: a = 3 b = 4 + a a = 6 print(b) The final line will print the value `b` stores, but this value is NOT equal to 4 + 6, because variables don't keep track of the expressions they were given -- they only store a single value as it existed at the time you assigned it. So line 2 there can be read as `b = 7` and therefore the last line will print 7. The `=` operator, in other words, should really be thought of as "stores the current value of" rather than "equals".
I think I get it now. That was a really good explanation thank you. 
You can try using an "guided interview" system to accomplish this. There is a Python based open source tool called [Docassemble](https://docassemble.org/) that does guided interviews but is targeted to the Legal field. You could create your health based rules and document templates and see how it works for you. It isn't exactly machine learning but its worth a shot to get started. 
&gt; reading bytes instead of chars Yes, because network data is bytes. It doesnt care what your encoding is. If you tell it 01101101, thats what is going down the wire. Its up to the application (in this case, your code) to know how to translate those bytes into meaningful information. Json decodes a string, so you need to encode the bytes appropriately first.
So he was basically saying an important skill is to clearly define your requirements?
This sounds like a good way to accidentally your server at scale. Better to learn the right way.

Still, there's those times where you start to write a program thinking about how ugly it'll be when you get done then you build up a base class and another class and when it's all done it looks nice, you don't see any ugliness, in fact you might call it beautiful, and the program works as if by magic. It's only happened to me a couple times...
I learned python 5 months ago because I was given a boring data entry task at work to fill out web page forms and I got tired of filling it out manually. I used my python script to automate entering data and navigating to the next screen using the Selenium package. &amp;#x200B; \&amp;nbsp; &amp;#x200B; This small project has lead into a massive one because I realized one of our departments spends several hours a week per person doing a similar, but more complex version of data entry. I made a completely non user-friendly program for 2 of my buddies there, and there's been a long QA testing going on with them for the last few months. This isn't part of my regular job, so I've only been working on it when free. I also don't have any formal QA testing environment nor any python master to talk to, so it's been rough at times. &amp;#x200B; \&amp;nbsp; &amp;#x200B; Both my buddies love the program, so now their entire team wants a copy. I spent the last 2 months perfecting the process, the error handling, and making this user-friendly for distribution. I even made my first GUI using python. &amp;#x200B; \&amp;nbsp; &amp;#x200B; Now I'm finally releasing my program next week to 15 employees, so I'm extremely ecstatic and wanted to share this. My current team doesn't share the same enthusiasm that I do about coding so I don't have many people to talk to. &amp;#x200B; \&amp;nbsp; It's been one roadblock after another trying to find good solutions for all these problems I've run into, so it's quite liberating finishing this project and writing this. I'm excited and scared, but more excited. I'll finally see whether my program is truly idiot-proof, whether it will get used routinely, and whether it will be more accurate than human-typed data entry. &amp;#x200B;
Yeah...I also that same doubt

You can learn scikit-learn, a machine learning package in python. The problem of deciding the kind of disease/ discomfort a patient is going through is a classification problem. You can look at logistic regression in the beginning in order to classify your rows according to the parameters. There are many more classification algorithms, but since I am a beginner, this is the solution I could suggest you. Also kindly go to kaggle and look at various competitions based on classification. All the best!
I’ve found that books help me more than video tutorials since I can keep my environment a little more distraction free. So id really recommend “Learn Python 3 the hard way” by zed Shaw. It’ll get you into the rhythm of typing code and running it pretty quick. You’ll have to use it in conjunction with some other tutorials though because he doesn’t explain the concepts as in depth as I’d like.

I use my system package manager (Pacman) to install things on my main system, and pip on Travis and my work’s interactive servers. Works like a charm and since binary packages on PyPI becomea lot more common and pip does caching, I don't see the need for the added complexity through conda anymore
I've been there coming from doing casual to a bit more involved stuff in VB/Excel and having done some light coding (Fortran, C) back in university. I did the free codeacademy python course (but the site changed a lot from 4 years ago and it seems this is now part of the data science path, not very clear if still free or not). In any case, it did a good job practicing syntax and idioms. From there, I made good use of the book Effective Python and lots of doc (standard lib and usual libraries) and stackoverflow reading.
Sounds like the pop up. It could either be a bug in the email software where nobody fully tested what happens when a user clicks cancel or the email is accessed in a browser and a misclick prevents further dialogs and made them return true immediately. If it was in a browser, I would've opened up the javascript console and wrote a hot patch to skip the dialog.

The task of narrowing diagnosis down isn't a bottleneck in hospitals in my experience as a doctor using machine learning technology in his research. Your system would likely end up making things less efficient (data entry etc.). Some areas where machine learning could be applied rather easily would be waiting times and patient priority. If the Hospitals ER is using the Manchester triage system for example, there are goal waiting times based on triage category. These can't be achieved for all patients in many ERs, so you could turn that into a minimization problem with a heavy penalty based on the triage category. Might be fun. Another option would be anticipating necessary diagnostic measures based on the diagnosis, e.g. will that patient need an xray before discharge to soft block an appointment automatically. In every vase, I would avoid working with the medical part of the hospital workflow and would go solely for administration, for reasons of liability and necessary legislation alone. In most countries, you are not allowed to just deploy software solutions that directly affect patients medical decisions, without vigorous testing and legal hurdles. And even if you are, I doubt that would be a good idea.
I agree. This looks very nice as a POC, but I can't imagine a scenario in which I'll actually put business logic in doc strings
No need to pay
Comments also add more work to maintain and can quickly go out of date. Better to write readable code and only add comments if something really tricky of unintuitive is going on. 
Using machine learning in a HOSPITAL, for literally ANY diagnostic purpose is horrific. I'm honestly astounded at the other posters here. You should not use machine learning for something with lives at stake. At the absolute minimum, it opens you up to a lawsuit. There is a standard of triage in place for a reason. The absolute most you could do is have patients input their symptoms, and assign a level of priority according to triage. For instance, someone with a broken arm is less urgent than someone with chest pain. The broken arm is unlikely to kill someone, but chest pain could be a heart attack. In the case that you do implement the symptom input system, you should be absolutely to certain to grab a consensus from the health care professionals at the hospital. Make sure you know what symptoms are high priority, and also what symptoms are high priority if COMBINED with other symptoms. I wouldn't trust the world's foremost expert in machine learning with designing a machine learning algorithm to diagnose medical issues. A. I. and M.L. are tools. Specifically, they are tools to solve for probabilities. By definition, no a.i. is going to be assuredly accurate. The entire premise of it is that you can feed a computer enough data, and hints about that data, for it to notice a pattern. A single hospital does not have the data to accurately represent this. In addition, in the u.s.there are concerns of HIPAA violations. Machine learning is cool as fuck. It's not ready to intervene in medical diagnoses, though. 
There's another specific use case for it: when adding a doc string but you really don't feel like writing useful documentation so you just write """ magic ;) """ And then your coworkers defenestrate you.
Oh. That's easy! Just add an `on_select` handler to call the same method as the edit button.

Could you elaborate what do you mean by all this? Thees seems vague. &amp;#x200B; Do you mean console client, as in a way to render minecraft inside console with ascii or something? &amp;#x200B; Do you mean console client as in ability to run minecraft from console and have some interpreter of instructions that would send properly transcribed requests? Like playing the game with instructions? I.E. Player.lookAhead(), Player.moveUp(2) etc? &amp;#x200B; Do you mean console client as in running miecraft from console with running standard jar but also having ability to pass arguments? &amp;#x200B; Do you mean client for minecraft console, as in ability to have raspberry connect to server as chat client and perform some form of automated moderation? &amp;#x200B; I can think of several more, but these here make most sense. So, could you describe this idea a bit more?
It was the pop up. Cancel didn't make any sense so I didn't think to try it, haha.
Oh thanks! This works :)
Stay as far away from triage as possible with your algorithm. If you mistriage a red patient into orange, this has a high likelihood of killing that person. Every other part of an medical algorithm, a doctor could ignore. If he is in the wrong triage category, a doctor might not see him in time. As mentioned in my comment: administrative workflow, not medical workflow. Even though I tried to be more supporting and give alternatives, I share your sentiment of this being a horrifying idea.

Try: python3 &lt;path/to/file.py&gt; and see if you get the same error. It's possible you somehow have multiple python3 binaries which are looking in different places for installed packages. By specifying the path to the python binary in the header you could be running the wrong one. which python3 Can help you determine which one you should be using. python3 -c "import site; print(f'Global packages: {site.getsitepackages()}');print(f'User packages: {site.getusersitepackages()}')" Will show you where that specific python binary looks for installed packages, both global and user-specific locations. pip3 show pymysql Will show you where pip has installed that specific package. Finally, if you want to see which modules are available in a given python instance start up a python terminal and: help('modules') And if you don't see the module you want there then it's not installed with the active instance of python.
Actually, FUD aside, machine learning is a great tool for the medical industry. My aunt work with companies that develop ML systems to detect abnormalities in scans and often the speed and accuracy is higher than a human. Everything is still verified by a human doctor, but its just one more tool in a doctor's arsenal to give better care. ------ That said, the people developing these tools are both medical experts and machine learning experts with extremely large data sets. I would not trust someone who popped up on Reddit asking how ML works to do anything in this field by themselves. You need a lot of expertise and data and those are both things OP isn't likely to come by unfortunately.

You can use dynamodb locally, they have a Java app that will allow you to simulate these sorts of things. From there you should be able to write tests around that service and confirm functionality.

You're welcome, enjoy it, let us know if you find issues [https://github.com/vaexio/vaex/issues](https://github.com/vaexio/vaex/issues)
I would go for something with dates. Maybe this... A simple CLI program separated into functions. You will enter your birthdate and it will tell you how old are you in years, months, weeks, days, .... This could catch the curiosity. Also you can add a small funny part and try to code a function based on the gender and some stats when they will die :) Like.... I enter I was born 1.1.1970 and I'm a male and the program will tell me: * You are xxx years old * You are xxx months old ..... And you will probably die in 2051 :) I guess ... 2h of coding as a tutorial is enough for that.
No. &amp;#x200B; If you are using pandas for this, you're just slapping some happy code together. What you just said is equivalent to, shouldn't you choose the ketchup rather than the mustard when you're eating chicken nuggets from the trash can?

Automate the boring stuff was an excellent starting point. It teaches: web scrapping, pdf scrapping, excel editing and other automation techniques. It’s super accessible and cuts past a lot of the noise to get you proving to yourself that you can build useful tools. Once you get through scripting to “automate boring/repetitive tasks” you can easily begin to design bigger/more ambitious projects. Best of luck!
Yes, look into the selenium library it will do what you want.

&gt;Since your company didn't take it, it's yours to share, no? Most likely not. Produced on company time and/or with company resources (computer)? Owned by the company, in most jurisdictions of the world.
As in, you're making a YouTube python tutorial? If it's for beginners, don't use confusing functions like `enumerate()` and keep it simple. Not sure what you're asking here tbh.
If you just want to start and manipulate the server-launcher [subprocess.Popen](https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.Popen) should be the right way to go. If you want to interact with your world maybe [this book](https://nostarch.com/programwithminecraft) could become handy. Can't say anything about the quality of the book, though.
What’s GIL ? 
And I have just realised that there really is no reason for that not to go into the demo... Now done!
Heres another one, torment your dev team with it: https://github.com/EnterpriseQualityCoding/FizzBuzzEnterpriseEdition
Things like prices total costs have usually a generic id in the html code of the web page. Therefore with a tool like scrapy or with beautifullsoup you can extract all the information you want very easily!
Everyone can contribute to the documentation :) If you have thoughts how to improve it, feel free to make a PR.
Really great video that talks about the same kind of things, but more long-term : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-gJtO0XR48
Automate the Boring Stuff has a decent chapter on [web scraping](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/chapter11/). It covers the main third party libraries I like to use: [Requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/) and [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/).
True, they paid for the code, so it's theirs.
That sounds really cool. Good luck!
Just get your own VPS imo
Shouldn't you write the `sub` function? BTW you are calling `sub` twice.
What do you don't get in the error message? you need to define a `def sub(complex)` method in the `Complex` class.

Good luck! I'm sure .find_all("div", attrs={"class": "content") is going to be your next best friend.
Congratulations, it sounds like you're killing it!
Thanks! Yeah, maybe we should just give a shot as you say. I see what the team thinks - your anecdote might help me convincing them to take the gamble. Besides, there really doesn't seem to be any python equivalent of nlme 
A bit overkill don't you think? Always try requests first.
Not even good for learnpython. 8 min vid to learn how to return value? Let's value our time more
part_number_list = input("Enter part numbers separated by comma":).split() then loop through each part #: web scrape for part #
You might be right, although as a learning experience (especially for someone less experienced) selenium can be easier to understand because you can see what's happening through a layer of abstraction rather than trying to reverse the HTTP protocol. Just my experience, I would whole heartedly agree that requests would probably lead to a simpler, more reliable solution.
I agree that most statis methods should be just seperate function. But I like to use static method when I need to group some functions in some kind of group (like parsing function for some file where I dont need any data shared in group). Or helper function that clearly belong to some class (not used anywhere else so I don't want to confuse anyone and put it in wider scope than class when it's used)
Amazing thank you! I will have a play later and see how I get on :D
I'm guessing reddit only detects duplicate links if they are posted as link posts. This post is a text post with a link in the text.

LPTHW is one of those ones that comes up a lot hanging out on Stack Overflow. I wouldn't recommend it (anti-recommend?) for lots reasons along these lines - [https://sopython.com/wiki/LPTHW\_Complaints](https://sopython.com/wiki/LPTHW_Complaints) . - The Dive Into Python one is good if you want written stuff.

Yes, VSCode [does autosave](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/codebasics#_save-auto-save).
Whoa! Which exam is this? 
https://www.soa.org/Education/Exam-Req/edu-exam-pa-detail.aspx
I use [Splinter](http://splinter.readthedocs.io) on top of Selenium. I find it's much nicer to use.
Save your money dude. You’re in finance, free is betterLearning is free for python. Get a python college textbook if you really want. Then just find challenges on Github to keep your skills up or find a project or task you want to perform, break it down into steps, and start Googling. 
Yeah Wikipedia loves their overly complicated notation! I'm still kinda bummed out that there's not some easy generalisation for it. I presumed all the masses would orbit around their common centre of mass or something nice and neat like that. Also not sure how much you care but there are improved versions of Euler's method that work on the exact same principle like the verlet method. I guess it depends on the time step you use as to whether it would make a significant difference though 
Consider writing a command line script. For instance, the first command line argument (import sys; sys.argv[1]) can be a filename to a CSV file. These can easily be created by e.g. Excel or Libreoffice calc, and you can make a bill of materials for a project, for instance. That way, you don't have to type the part numbers every time. Loop through each line in the CSV file (import csv gives you the csv module, built into python). You can connect to the website with requests or selenium, as others have mentioned. Requests will be faster, selenium probably easier to understand in the beginning. Which website are you scraping?
There will eventually be a Python 4, but it won't be a large breaking change like the 2 -&gt; 3 transition. It'll just be the next version number after 3.9.
Is it really that slow? I've never really noticed it unless I'm doing a crazy amount of lookups. Btw, if you find yourself constantly looking up the same values you can wrap a lru_cache around your lookup function to speed things up.
As people have said, go get the HTML of the page using requests if you can. If the page has a lot of important things things rendered in JavaScript then use Selenium instead. Once you have the HTML, pass it to BeautifulSoup to go through the page easily. You'll find yourself using the .find_all() method a lot.
Hii, I am a beginner with some basic programming experience. Right now, I am working to redesign my blog - [codeitbro.com](https://codeitbro.com) using Python and Django. Hopefully, I will be able to learn it asap. Wish me luck guys :)
r/programme_irl
I've worked places that used both, and honestly I'd flip that around. Flask expects that you already know how to go out and get a bunch of other components (ORM, template language, etc.), hook them up, and organize your codebase. Which is something that brand-new programmers, or even brand-new web programmers, often don't know. Django has a learning curve, yes, but it gives you all the core components of a web app, already integrated, and strong suggestions about how to organize your code. So I'd say Flask is more for the experienced developers who know exactly what they want to use and how to wire it together.
Check out scrapy . They have very good tutorial and it’s state of art of modern scrapping.
what KimPeek said, this person is flooding the group.
Yeah get a book maybe two do the examples and more importantly end of chapter exercises.
Do not waste any money the courses. Go the the official Python docs and tutorial and complete them. The thing is you have to repeat it many times but they are always going to be most accurate and latest. And once you feel you are bit familiar with the language, try implementing any idea using the concepts you have just learnt. If you do not understand something do research, read docs again. This way, you will have a very strong foundation to build on. I myself learnt using this way and have been writing Python professionally for more than 7 years now. &amp;#x200B; Cheers!
I think selenium easier especially if the page is mostly rendered by javascript
Sometimes you just gotta be a crackhead.
I know this risks death here, but node.js + request + cheerio would work nicely for this.
I'm working on my personal project [https://github.com/weibullguy/ramstk](https://github.com/weibullguy/ramstk) &amp;#x200B; Any comments, feedback, issues, pull request, etc. welcome.
I always tell people to just start a project and google your way until you figure it out. Take the CodeAcademy Python course to learn basic syntax. Then choose a project and start coding. When you run into problems, google them until you figure it out. If you’re looking for specific libraries to learn for finance you will probably want to learn NumPy and pandas. Make something you would typically do in Excel such as a simple regression using these libraries. If you want to visualize it use matplotlib. You also may want to check out r/datascience. It is probably more related to what you’re trying to do then this sub. It’s hard at first learning to write code, but don’t give up. The initial learning process was the hardest part for me. 
Holy Jesus in heaven, do NOT expose n00bs to the horror of coding dates. A pretty traditional first "real" program is a number guessing game. If they've never programmed before they won't even know anything about variables or conditionals, so they will definitely fill 2 hours getting this working.
Just to save you from some needless headaches, if your target page is rendered by javascripts or have dynamic contents, you might be pulling your hair out trying to figure why you couldn't find the element you so clearly saw during your user session. The reason is these contents are not rendered by `requests` or `BeautifulSoup` so they didn't even exist in the response to begin. In that case, you'll need to use other modules that render these dynamic contents like `selenium` or `requests-html`.
You mean run a python console and connect to Minecraft on another machine?
If OP is doing this for with and aiming to further their skills, learning `selenium` is not overkill since it's a sought after skillset used widely around the industry. Could be a career changing skill to acquire if you become good at it.

I'd be happy to see Pandas get replaced by a better option. I'm of the opinion now that it actively harms your ability to do data analysis. Users should not have to know such esoteric rules for things such as subset selection and implicit data alignment. The API is one of the worst designed in the python data science ecosystem with numerous methods that duplicate other methods without providing additional benefit. There is also a tremendous amount of overhead now added on top of NumPy. Summing a single column of data is nearly as fast in pure Python and about an order of magnitude slower than it is in Numpy (I can provide tests for this if someone cares). The code base is also incredibly complex and it takes forever to understand it, so contributing is a very painful process.
Yeah that would have been nice, but sadly that kind of solution only works if you limit yourself to two bodies. I have looked at a lot of methods and I have implemented a few of them. The most important feature is that they preserve energy in the system which helps keep the planets in orbit. Accuracy is just a bonus part. But I would love to add even more of them. Do you know what they are called (or perhaps a wikipedia link)?
Oh I didn't know that! It's fast now (takes around 0.04s for the function to run) and I wonder how much faster it can run. Thanks for the heads up tho, I will try it out and revise the script if I find it any better :)
I've been using pytest as runner successfully in an application that use flask + sqlalchemy + alembic. I would stick to this setup for a new project. Also, this application uses MySQL because it's the database the company adopt as default. (personally I prefer Postgres, but it's a personal taste without technical reasons)
Ive been in places where I can (and have) owned my work and posted it publicly for my benefit. I explicitly cant in my current gig. 
If you're talking about programming languages, I use ply and it works quite well.

What I'm saying is... If it's possible with requests do it with requests, if not go for the browser. Everything is good to know.
Upvote 1000 times. This library is so difficult to learn because of all of its random methods. I constantly find myself reviewing the documentation and banging my head against the wall every time I need to do data manipulation. I hate to say this but R is actually much better when it comes to transforming data.
What do you think should happen? 
I thought that was going to happen to me yesterday. I've been working on a script that installs an IPA server, imports sudo commands from the sudoers file, and imports the local users all in one go. Yesterday was the first time the server was going to be added to the lab and no one was mentioning my script in the meeting before the install. Luckily it came up at the last second and the script was used later that day. Keep up the hard work, though. Like other people have said it is valuable experience.
This is interesting. The last `a = a + 1` shouldn't assign the global `a` because the `global` keyword shouldn't be called but it seems like it is.
If `requests` is the right fit for you, you might also want to check out [cloudfare-scrape](https://github.com/Anorov/cloudflare-scrape) (app named `cfscrape`) when encoutering problems with Cloudflare's anti-bot pages.
That looks pretty cool, I'll be checking that out in my next web scraping project.
Keep taking ten minutes to switch between branches and have fun being a curmudgeonly dickhead on the internet. 
It's because `global` is more like a tag, not a function that needs to execute. If we look at the generated bytecode of `foo` in ``` a = 1 def foo(): if False: global a a = a + 1 # a = a + 1 print(a) foo() print(a) ``` we see that it becomes ``` 8 0 LOAD_GLOBAL 0 (a) 2 LOAD_CONST 1 (1) 4 BINARY_ADD 6 STORE_GLOBAL 0 (a) 9 8 LOAD_GLOBAL 1 (print) 10 LOAD_GLOBAL 0 (a) 12 CALL_FUNCTION 1 14 POP_TOP 16 LOAD_CONST 0 (None) 18 RETURN_VALUE ``` Note that the `if False` block doesn't appear, because the compiler has optimized it away. But we still `LOAD_GLOBAL` on `a`, because `global a` existed in the function definition. `global a` just changes which bytecode operations are going to be used in the result (`LOAD_CONST` or `LOAD_GLOBAL`, basically). Strangely enough, ``` def foo(): a = a + 1 global a print(a) ``` gives a `SyntaxError: name 'a' is used prior to global declaration`. The compiler probably removes the `if False` after doing this check, so it doesn't realize that the `global a` is technically in a part of the function that never executes, but it doesn't care at that point.

We have to protect the cuddly pandas.
&gt; I use my system package manager (Pacman) to install things on my main system Don't do this. 
Automate the Boring Stuff is an excellent book, perfectly suited to the job you have in mind and will get you up and running quickly. The only thing I would like to add is please don't start with Python 2, its being discontinued and their are compatibility issues moving forward. I found the [teamtreehouse.com](https://teamtreehouse.com) Python coding based Python 3 tutorial by Kenneth Love excellent.
Agreed
Newish to python. I'm working on a rather simple rc4 encrypted remote access tool.
This is a great post for r/learnpython, actually! I expect you'll get more help there.
Here's the link to the course 'Automate the Boring Stuff' by Al Sweigart on Udemy, you can get unlimited time access to the course for as little as $10 bucks during the sale which is very frequent. [https://www.udemy.com/automate/](https://www.udemy.com/automate/)
Yes, Pandas is very difficult to learn for beginners. I remember how long it took me to get the rules straight for \`\[\]\`, \`loc\`, \`iloc\`, \`at\`, \`iat\`, and the now deprecated \`ix\` just to select some data. There are even methods to select data such as \`take\` and \`get\` which should never be used. There is accessing columns with the dot notation, which in my opinion, should never be used. It's just so difficult to even select data without help. At least 50% of the methods can get eliminated and from the remaining, if you don't count the statistical ones, only a handful are needed to do data analysis. 
An empty split() will split by spaces, you'd want split(','). Also, this gives no suggestions on how to do the actual web scraping, which I think OP wanted more help on.
How good are you with Linux, that is a must have for this and most other Python programming jobs. Now that you have some Python experience, try creating a bigger project. Something that would be helpful for you or that you've wanted to do for a long time. This will help you focus your efforts and teach you about where problems may arise and how to fix them and serve as a portfolio project when it is time to apply for jobs. Also, I'd like to know how have you been studying Python?
I regularly use [BeautifulSoup / bs4](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/doc) for scraping all kinds of things. It is incredibly simple yet powerful. If you need to also fill in forms, like scraping forms behind login forms use [MechanicalSoup](https://mechanicalsoup.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) which is just BeautifulSoup with the addition of forms.
Check netsec or howtohack or learnpython
Or you capture the xhr requests with the browser console, emulating being the browser and still using requests and some sort of deserializer because the data is transferred in json or some format similar to it. 
I think most if not all of us are aware how open source works. [Users should be able to voice their desires without being told "submit a PR"](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=patches%20are%20welcome)
Python is my bread and butter, but you are right. The tidyverse makes data manipulation effortless with R. Pandas is extremely rigid in comparison to a data_frame. 
 2 1 Because a should not be global. But it it.
I like the idea of global being a tag and not an instruction. Could you edit your message and format it the right way ? (add 4 spaces at the beginning of every line of code).

On /r/LearnPython the community and the r/Python discord are actively expecting questions and are looking to help. You can expect far more understanding, encouraging and insightful responses over there. **No matter what level of question you have, if you are looking for help with Python, you should get good answers**. Make sure to check out the rules for both places. Warm regards, and best of luck with your Pythoneering!
stay away from beautifulsoup, it's for autists (and ridiculously hard to install) Go with requests, and lxml for html parsing
I think GitHub is the best. If you want to further promote it you could post it on Twitter with the appropriate hashtags. 
When I was first starting out, I kept hearing what was echoed here. Flask is for beginners, small projects, Django is for experienced, large projects. Completely false. Django's best attribute is the standardization, which is why the orm is great for that. It meets 90% of project needs in terms of scaling and what modules you will be using. Everything is left to the developer as a choice in Flask (organization, libraries, etc). As such, it can fit every senario, but the developers experience is the factor in how well it performs. Django tends to be used where there are teams of solo developers (like web design shops), where you want standardization, quick turn around, minimal oversight. Flask is generally used by freelancers, or large teams, where the project tends to be more complex or niche like developing just the API or having lots of custom logic.
Yep
ah, good tip. I just ran into that yesterday and was wondering what the trick might be. was trying to scrape a torrent site for a list of new movies but the names are hidden in Javascript. thanks 
Can you loop through your cases a million times or so so we can see actual elapsed times?
If something is good, why do you need to replace it?
Python is just a language. Languages are simple. I wouldn't pay a dime just to learn a language; there's far too many resources available for free. Programming itself, on the other hand, is a science. Have you studied programming? If not, I'd pay for a course on programming fundamentals instead. Once you have the mental framework in place for programming, you can learn the basics of pretty much any language in a week or less. C was my first language. After that, Python, Perl, C++, and R each took a week or less to get the fundamentals down. 
I had some basic exposure in coursework, but found the following book to provide a great overview to basic python when I was trying to use it more regularly at work: Python Crash Course: A Hands-On, Project-Based Introduction to Programming Written by Eric Matthes 
Add LICENSE file too, MIT or something.
I've been trying to get xhr in an automated way, but it seems that doing so requires a library like browsermob-proxy. Do you know a better way?
I can. I was merely looking at bytcode level with python -m dis source.py &gt; dis
That sounds unnecessarily complicated if the modules I listed can do the same thing... Though if you want to further your skills this is definitely good practice.
That's because **global** is a _parser directive_; it has meaning at the moment the code is _parsed_ for the first time, and it doesn't even exist within the compiled object used at runtime. Basically there's an assumption that a re-assignment in a local scope to a name that was initially assigned in the global scope is a programming error. By using the **global** in the text _before_ the re-assignment you tell the parser that the error was intentional. The parser doesn't understand the branch, or care about it; it just sees `global a` before `a += 1` is ever encountered and thinks "right, if I ever see **a** being re-assigned within the scope I'm parsing you want me to assume you're not doing something stupid." Which you _probably_ are; there's a reason why **global** is heavily discouraged... the odds are _very_ good you should be doing it another way... but the parser doesn't know that.
Hey, I'm not known with the library so I'm not sure if it works on linux but, take a look at [this](https://pypi.org/project/python_arptable/) &amp;#x200B;
I'm a bit confused with the license. What is that? 
I try to use requests or BeautifulSoup unless the website uses JavaScript to show the information I need. If that's the case, I'll use selenium.
I'm pretty Twitter illiterate. Maybe someone else will take it and do that 😂
You could put it all in a module and submit it to PyPi as well, but that's got some extra work required
Paths specifically are a Pro feature, which is like 20 bucks a month I think. Worth it if you're going to be using it often. 
First, not to be that person, but you should not store local copies of plaintext passwords in files like this. It's a massive security hole. In general, you should simply rely on Windows to reliably and securely manage the password for you. Often, blank passwords are disabled by policy. (Which is also generally a good idea.) Are you sure that hasn't happened here? The only weird thing here would be that the error message is different, which is itself a bit of a security leak, but that's not your problem. If you really need to be able to do this, you can wrap the whole thing in an if statement, something like this: if password == "": try: .... else: tkinter.messagebox.showerror("Title", "Password wrong!") You can put your own code in to handle the blank password, of course. I don't think there's a secure way to determine whether a password was intentionally left blank, so I think you're forced to deny access for folks with blank passwords in this case.
Did you actually try to benchmark it? My blind guess would be that CALL\_METHOD instruction actually runs a lot of code under the hood. But it's just a guess, unfortunately - I'm not an expert when it comes to Python bytecode.
Mmmm.... good one. Makes sense 
MAC addresses are used in [Layer 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_link_layer) of the [OSI Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model), so they are only used to help route packets within the LAN. When packets are routed outside the LAN (using Layer 3 of the OSI Model), the MAC address from the original PC is removed from the packet and replaced by the MAC address of of the router, so there is no way to find out the MAC address of a remote machine (outside the LAN) using just network packets. In order to get the MAC address of a remote PC, you would have to run some software locally on that PC (or another PC or router connected to the same LAN as that PC.
**Data link layer** The data layer, or layer 2, is the second layer of the seven-layer OSI model of computer networking. This layer is the protocol layer that transfers data between adjacent network nodes in a wide area network (WAN) or between nodes on the same local area network (LAN) segment. The data link layer provides the functional and procedural means to transfer data between network entities and might provide the means to detect and possibly correct errors that may occur in the physical layer. The data link layer is concerned with local delivery of frames between nodes on the same level of the network. *** **OSI model** The Open Systems Interconnection model (OSI model) is a conceptual model that characterizes and standardizes the communication functions of a telecommunication or computing system without regard to its underlying internal structure and technology. Its goal is the interoperability of diverse communication systems with standard protocols. The model partitions a communication system into abstraction layers. The original version of the model defined seven layers. *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Python/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28
You’re assuming that each bytecode operation takes the same time as every other. That’s not true. If you want to test performance you need to actually time things.
If i can reach it's router ie its gateway, can i use python to grab the router's mac table and fetch the mac address i want from it?
First, simplify, you're putting way too much through **dis** there to get a decent picture of what's happening. The format route: &gt;&gt; def via_format(name): return "{name}".format(name) &gt;&gt; dis(via_format) 4 0 LOAD_CONST 1 ('{name}') 2 LOAD_ATTR 0 (format) 4 LOAD_FAST 0 (name) 6 CALL_FUNCTION 1 8 RETURN_VALUE The f-string route: &gt;&gt; def via_fstring(name): return f"{name}" &gt;&gt; dis(via_fstring) 4 0 LOAD_FAST 0 (name) 2 FORMAT_VALUE 0 4 RETURN_VALUE It's that special **FORMAT_VALUE** instruction where the speed comes in, along with simply not having to even look up a method.
Yeah I'm not sure that I'm advanced enough to be making my own modules. Perhaps in the future though!
darn! I was looking at too much of a big picture! Shame, Shame, Shame! Now I get it, cheers!

Learned something new... thanks for the links. I've updated the code. It seemed like a good idea at the time. One thing lambda does that a def doesn't is allow definition to happen with some of the variables being out of scope. A def produces an a not defined error. Doesn't make it right however. I'll look at the functools too. 
I've used Java jsoup and selenium. Selenium to navigate and grab page source jsoup to parse. Works great but takes some trial and error depending on the page. 
Yes.
Aye
Emulating a full browser should always be your last resort. It's SLOOOOOOOOW.
Yep. Python 2.7 is end-of-life in 18 months time. 
It sounds like you have two real requirements here - one for the actual storage of the information, and one for the display of it. From what you've described, Python is a great language to manage the information, rather than it living in Excel. &amp;#x200B; For the dashboard and display point of view, you can certainly do some of that using a Python framework like Django or Flask - replacing the (I guess conditionally formatted/VBA led?) sheet based display you have with some simple HTML. Versioning of data is also no problem - I use something similar to do monte-carlo analysis for business cases, and change the inputs that go in, test assumptions, and then revert to move onto the next one (Django, HTML). However, if you want to step up the dashboard action, then you could use a Python API (again, Django DRF or Flask for this), with a Javascript front end - I plucked \[this as a random example\]([https://github.com/misterGF/CoPilot](https://github.com/misterGF/CoPilot)) from this list - [https://madewithvuejs.com/blog/the-best-vue-js-admin-dashboards](https://madewithvuejs.com/blog/the-best-vue-js-admin-dashboards) Effectively you'd build the business logic in python, and use an off-the-shelf to display the dashboard. &amp;#x200B;
That's disappointing. I reinstalled my os and still can't seem to get python to load any packages installed via pip. This language shouldn't be so difficult to actually get to work.
In Case you're interested there's a talk from pycon 18 from a Django dev on bytecode
Do ya have the link mayhaps mate?
Sure thing mate ;) https://youtu.be/cSSpnq362Bk
lovely!
Here's a quick outline of what you need to know: **Requests** is useful for this if you want to scrape static html pages. This should be the first thing you try. If the data is not available statically (which may be the case), try selenium. **Selenium** is useful if the data is hidden behind JavaScript events (e.g. you have to fill out a form first or the data is dynamically loaded after the web page itself is loaded. There's a bit more of a learning curve here, but if you need help, I can send you a quick run-down of how to get started :) **Beautiful Soul** is useful no matter what imo. Feed it the source code of a page, and it will allow you to search for elements, navigate through them easily, and obtain the data efficiently. Trust me, this will save a lot of headache :) A few other tips: make sure you respect the robots.txt file of the site. Additionally, you may want to put in a time.sleep(2) between your requests. This will make your scraping take longer, but it will ensure that you are not blacklisted by the website for scraping too aggressively. Know that websites change, sometimes quite frequently. Code you write today may need maintenance in a week. After you have had some practice, you'll get a feel for how to write more robust code that can stand up to the changes made to a webpage, but be prepared to be making changes frequently to keep this running. Note that even though it will require maintenance, you are STILL saving tons of time by scraping v. obtaining the data by hand. Happy scraping!
I double that. I learned more from him then from any other PAID course I took. Also recommend the books: Learn Python The Hard Way and Automate the Boring Stuff With Python (for exercises). Lastly, practice a lot, try to follow each tutorial (typing the code, not copying it) you will thank yourself later.
Maybe, if the router allows remote admin, and you have the administrator password, but no, not using [ARP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_Resolution_Protocol). 
**Address Resolution Protocol** The Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is a communication protocol used for discovering the link layer address, such as a MAC address, associated with a given internet layer address, typically an IPv4 address. This mapping is a critical function in the Internet protocol suite. ARP was defined in 1982 by RFC 826, which is Internet Standard STD 37. ARP has been implemented with many combinations of network and data link layer technologies, such as IPv4, Chaosnet, DECnet and Xerox PARC Universal Packet (PUP) using IEEE 802 standards, FDDI, X.25, Frame Relay and Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM). *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Python/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28
Try something like: import pymysql The [documentation](https://pymysql.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/examples.html) has it that way and in a quick test, I got it to work like this. Additionally, I recommend having a look at virtual environments: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23842713/using-python-3-in-virtualenv Also, I find 18.04 to be a bit more palatable with Python 3, so if it's not too difficult (ie - if this is virtualenv, and there aren't other considerations) making a switch there might make your life easier (only if making a switch is relatively trivial would I recommend this). 
If there is no license, then people assume that software is yours and no one is allowed to use or copy it. If you want freely share your code, then software should have some open source license (MIT is popular) that grants people permission to copy, modify and use it.
I never had trouble installing beautiful soup, and in my opinion it is incredibly easy to use. Seems a little presumptive to label everyone who uses it. Considering it's the more popular library, perhaps you haven't given it a fair chance?
...what?
Sadly sentdex has the problem that lots of paid courses actually use his stuff (udemy for example). But yes, sentdex and a good book and you're good to go
Typically the most frequently asked questions in interviews require a good understanding of data structures and there time/space complexity (that's how you choose a data structure to use to solve a problem). I personally haven't encountered algorithms in an interview but having a good understanding of how algorithms are written and the logic behind them will help you come up with your own algorithm to solve the specific question in an interview. They might ask you questions related to databases so having a small understanding of SQL never hurt anyone. If you are looking into front end jobs then having some JavaScript under your belt can help as well. Focus on data structures, big (O) and some common/famous algorithms. I hope that answers your question. 
That is what fails.....
Got it! I just added the license. Thank you!!
Note - I wrote it differently from what you wrote above. Mine are all lower case - what you wrote above is not. import PyMySql will fail, but import pymysql should not fail.
Have you tested it with more than one email? i = 0 while i &lt; len(email): for name in email: if name==None: pass else: s.sendmail(username,email[i],message.as_string()) i+=1 This seems wrong. You are iterating email twice. One with unpythonic while i &lt; len, and another one with for. You don't compare with None. It should be if name is None Or actually since you don't do anything with this branch you should really do If name is not None I am on the phone, so formatting can be broken. Also since it's a script you really should put the running logic in the if __name__=="__main__" : I would also suggest to not to hardcode row numbers and try whole column and filter by email regex 
Here's the relevant section from my computing class https://i.imgur.com/WpKpsnT.png That final paragraph seems relevant to what you mentioned with the energy. Also here's a comparison of the methods we had to do for that class https://i.imgur.com/XGJLXXN.png 
get the xhr from the network tab in chrome/firefox dev tools and copy the cURL form of the entire request, then paste it to some curl-to-requests converter or better yet, use Postman, which allows you to play around the parameters in a GUI and even convert the request to code in popular languages and library (including requests) then use json/whatever to deserialize the response and use it.
I have tried both. I have tried both with shebangs as well. 
Check altair :)

This library only works on Linux, not Windows. However, from the Windows command line you can enter "arp -a", which gets pretty much the same result.
&gt;Sadly sentdex has the problem that lots of paid courses actually use his stuff (udemy for example) I know what you mean, even Sentdex made a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7jf70dNrUo) talking about that. Which is sadder is that Udemy (the platform) had a great opportunity to be something really good, but I guess people just want to make easy money with practically zero effort. Teaching is a talent that fewer and fewer people seem to have.
Yes
It's what happens when I reply early in the morning without coffee ;-). Actually, OP didnt want specific codes.

Thank you for sharing it :-D I think I'm in fact using the Euler-Cromer method in my simulation and not Euler's method. If you are interested in an even more accurate method search for PEFRL. I found an interesting pdf about it by googling.
You have not understood "global" and how it is to be used.
&gt; Have you tested it with more than one email? LOL 
Thanks! It's good to see more advanced workflow instead of beginner install guides. Got any more?
Super cool, thank you for sharing! I wonder whether Vaex could be beneficial for my use case. Lets say i have 3TB text data with additional information attached to it and the data is split up in multiple .bz2 files over several folders with subfolders. I want to do a full text search on the column holding the text data. My current approach is to load everything into a single postgres table and create an index on the text column; However, data ingestion and index creation just takes forever on my HDD. Could Vaex help me here?
 Thank you so much for the explanation， I really appreciate it. 
Thanks for the answer. The reason I write the password as plaintext to the text file is because it is an forensics tool. When a user is logged in, you can't logout the user in risk of never getting in again. With this part of the tool you can ask someone for the password and checking if it is the correct password without having to logout. I think I will use the if statement as suggested and just say that empty passwords can't be checked or something like that. The only weird thing is I know that on Windows 7 you can use an account without a password, but it gives the same error. It will probably have to do with security or something like you said. Thanks for the advice!
Awesome thank you! This is a great chunk of info to digest and work with. Seems selenium might be good to learn anyway by most accounts but I will certainly start simple and scale up as needed! Thanks for your time and I will report in how it all goes :)

[Headless Chrome](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/04/headless-chrome) is insanely faster (and less buggy) than Selenium. I’ve only used it for simple tasks, but it worked great for me! To clarify, I’ve tried to build several scalable web crawling services using Selenium, and apart from random Java exceptions (mainly socket connection errors), processes would also hang, making it reliably unreliable. 
Try this one: https://github.com/chuckinator0/Projects/tree/master/secretSanta Check out python’s smtplib. The readme has a link to a nice blog post. With Gmail, you can create an application specific password for this purpose as well. No need to get into excel files. Just use a csv.
In two Weeks it will be a year of programming under the ol belt for me. I wish I'd had started a long time ago but I am just happy I have finally started learner the art. This Game is a work in progress so if things dont work just let me know or if you find a bug.
If you have the documentation for the instrument there should be a section about GPIB instructions. I remember doing this a year or two ago for a Keithley SMU. There was no need for PyVISA or following any specific standard. I used argparse to set some kind of CLI and called whatever function necessary that contained a set of strings with wanted parameters. The excel part should be simple. You just need openpyxl or xlsxwriter or something else that suits you.
Nice stuff. Looking for any collaboration on this?
I didn't know what to make of your question since you didn't provided any context with which to assist or prod you. Then it dawned on me, maybe you haven't written anything in python 3 before. If that's the case, then when to bite the bullet and start learning some new tricks is a question only you can answer. If the program in question is not aggressively maintained or enhanced from time to time then you may want to leave it. But a decision to leave python scripts as python 2 does have some risks. For example, if it uses the system installed python, one day those system pythons will all be python 3 and your script will stop working. Now if it's a big code base and you don't want to touch it with all of that python 3 behaviors then you will bear the brunt of work needed to keep it working using python 2. That includes the libraries that your script uses. And should those libraries latest releases stop supporting python 2 then you will need to freeze your dependencies to the older libraries that supported python 2. And that probably means that your script needs to be virtualenv-tized if it isn't already. Long and short of it is, just do it as the others have said. Python 3, that is.

&gt; dmesg -T | grep -E -i -B50 'killed process' Yeah, I just checked, its not in the kernel log
Status on 100k ports is relatively small, so keeping it in memory a non-issue. The catch comes from your own problem statement that indicates that you need to persist the data for a 'few months'. You need to work the use case of how you recover if your system loses power. &amp;#x200B; My guess is that with a polling interval of 15 minutes on each port, that you'd be best served by a small MySQL server instance. You can run it on the same machine that does the status polling.
Thanks! I implemented a MySQL database about 10 years ago, but I’ve forgotten a lot. I was thinking it might be overkill. 
It sounds like this was a hack at one time to satisfy a clients needs and then exploded into a “product” that is in demand. This is often how VBA apps turn into unmaintainable demonds. Can Python help here? It certainly can to some extent but I see a bigger problem here in that the entire platform needs to be reengineered. Frankly my immediate thought was that you need to implement a database to store all of this data or at least a good portion of it. You could of course implement a system that stores data in simpler files but then you have to duplicate a lot of functionality a database program would provide. I can’t say for sure how complex the database would have to be but it could be rather simple storing time stamps, raw data, system location and device info. However depending upon exactly what is going on here a far more complex database might be in order. How is your SQL? Python cancertainly do most of the work here but I wouldn’t eliminate other languages immediately. More importantly you need to make decisions on how this data will be delivered. Will it be delivered to a web browser from a server or will you have a custom app delivering the data to the customer? You might be able to deliver the entire solution in Python if the client is a browser. Other wise Python sucks for native apps. It is likely a bit misleading to use the word “entire” above. Either approach still requires additional language support. For example a web solution will likely require JavaScript and CSS; in either case we must support SQL. So Python here really isn’t the show stopper, rather you need to engineer a robust solution that makes customers happy. Beyond that you are likely to have customers asking for web solutions and native app solutions so that is a real issue. Oh by the way there are likely 100’s of ways to do this, all of them right in one context or another. 
thank you and sorry about that. 
Hi Abdul. I think you need to work a bit on your english, it is unnecessarily complex at times and some of your phrases do not make sense. I also think there's not really any worthwhile content in this post. As mentioned in your post to /r/programming, there are no actual benchmarks or validity statements made one way or the other.

I'm gonna be honest, vaex is currently not the best choice for text. This will very likely change in the future when arrow support will improve, and our machine learning plans we have.

Are you asking about OCR (optical character recognition) to recognize text in an image? Where is the table coming from?
If the second one doesn't work, then there's something in your setup that is non-obvious that is introducing some kind of a problem. I recommend checking out the discord (linked above or in the sidebar) and seeing if you can get some real time help. For what it's worth, I did test this and had no problems, so I don't think it's the library; I think it might be something about how your environment is set up.
I'm going through the automatetheboringstuff now with the end goal of scraping my work website for shifts that are posted. Pretty sure it's loaded in Java so thanks for saving me the time when I get there lol
I fear articles like this get.upvoted by bots. It's basically front page pollution
Yes it can be done. &amp;#x200B; In terms of the scraping. Start off with requests and BeautifulSoup. Add in a time.sleep(1) into your loop so you don't overload the website. Then move on to Scrapy if you need it, it's a bigger framework but it's better to start off with the smaller stuff. &amp;#x200B; In terms of a UI, worry about that later. For now just get the code working. Once that works - BOOM! You're the guy who gets this shit done super quick. Then maybe have it import and export to a csv file. Finally if you really need to you can build a simple UI.
