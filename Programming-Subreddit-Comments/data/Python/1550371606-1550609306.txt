You can do this automatically using gmms and a parsimony measure like BIC and AIC. Do my even need to click the peaks
Just a little advice, you are using list comprehensions as inputs to set() or as the iterable in the for loop. In those cases, since you don't need the list afterwards, just user a generator comprehension so you don't create a list and then throw it away. Anywhere you are passing an iterable (like the input to set), try using generators as much as you can.
Honestly while it's necessary to have a degree in engineering for many jobs, if you have a lot of impressive projects under your belt you can get places, not to mention your skill in python (the sort of thinking required to determine how you would implement features) will totally transfer to other languages, which will come very easy once you crack that first egg.
Please stop with these.
A Linux installation isn't completely necessary, but I'd get comfortable using bash if you don't already know it. Play around with the Ubuntu subsystem for Windows.

The default OS, Raspbian, is pretty similar to Ubuntu. I first learnt Linux using Raspbian on the Pi and now use Ubuntu as my daily driver. On the command line it's basically the same, which makes sense because they're both built on Debian

your reasoning is wrong. use the database. the database is your friend also, there's no need to pickle simple data. pickling is for preserving/restoring python objects which are more complex than plain data. pickling data will create unnecessarily large files. use any other serialization format before you use pickle. but like i said, use the database the answer to your question will depend on your machine and the resources available
Probably just start using cPickle.

Trying to figure out how to take 128 hex numbers 2 bytes large from 115200 Baud serial connection from arm MCU and plot them at a decent rate using pyqtgraph. While learning python. I think I've successfully got a method to capture the data into a numpy array. Just trying to figure out a way to plot it in a animated fashion via qtgui.

Any idea how the python language can be useful at a law firm. I am currently enrolled in a beginners course to learn how to code using python. What advantages can I demonstrate that it would bring to the firm? 
I am currently working on a data mining tool that uses public data to identify malicious actors in online communities. The data processing itself is not fancy or anything, but I'm putting a lot of work into the management tools and ease of use.
As an active Spanish learner nowadays, I developed a vocabulary learning application. It's like Enki; the one I developed is for desktop.

That's why he was able to break it, this wouldn't have happened if the INTERNET was built in PHP or NodeJS
Find something you want to build, something real that is actually useful, and try to build it. Most likely you will fail, but that's fine, you still learn a ton. Then pick another project and build that. You will go through a bunch of failures, but again, you learn from all of them. And then at some point you will be good enough at judging what you can handle, and actually finish a project. And then you just keep going. That's how pretty much every serious coder so far has learned the craft.
What school / field of study do you follow?
Go to the "Euler project", that have all sorts of problems for any level. 
Yeah I guess

I wold like to practice advanced problems like OOP and of course my goal is to be able program serious stuff 
Yes and no. In all cases below i calculate the fib(n) for n is a random number &lt; 100, and took the average of 100 attempts, to allow the cache to be filled. This way I make it very advantageous to increase the maxsize. If maxsize = 100: fib(n) takes about 6.5 microseconds. If maxsize = 2: fib(n) takes about 1.3 milliseconds. without lru_cache: fib(n) takes about 31000 years. So yes, a higher maxsize does help, but just caching 2 is enough for most use cases.
Oh no, its 2.7!

This isn't a Python thing, it's a neural nets thing or maybe data science thing.
Could you define your data a bit better? Are these like graph images? How much data do you have?

What motor controller are you using? My main issue with gpio is that it only outputs 3v. So speed control can be bad.

It's irrelevant, because you should never use pickle. The problem with pickle is that it serializes code just like data, so loading a pickle amounts to executing arbitrary code. From an infosec perspective, this is OK only if the pickle is "known-good", which means you need to treat it just like you treat your source code: it cannot be writable by the process that runs it, it must be provided statically when deploying the application, it must go through the same code review processes as the other source code, etc. If you don't do that, then your application is essentially self-modifying, and that's generally considered a security nightmare. In practice, this means that it is practically always easier to just write the damn code in plain old Python instead of pickling it. When you do need to load data provided dynamically, use something else: a database, JSON, CSV, whatever works best. An industry-strength database like postgresql has limits that are so insanely large that you won't need to know them - billions of rows are routine, databases weighing in at several terabytes won't make it sweat, the limitations you'll first encounter are network bandwidth and physical storage space rather than the software.

Not PEP9 style
"Ralph Breaks PEP 8"
it's retarded
Ultimately it is a histogram with 1h bins between 0-24h on the bottom and a normalised value on the vertical ranging between 0-1. I'm expecting that graphs for one classification will follow a linear form and the second will follow a Gaussian form. However, I'm expecting the graphs to shift along the X-axis so I'm looking to fit the form of data not the location of the data. Does that make more sense? &amp;#x200B; Instead of plotting I can keep the data in a pandas dataframe where each bin value would be a column. I'm mainly worried that random forests will focus on particular bins to evaluate classifications. However, due to the nature of shifting across the X-axis I dont know if a traditional approach would work.
if there is a classical approach that is proven to be optimal a NN will not beat it. And if the classical method ignores some features there's a big chance that the NN will come to the same conclusion especially if there is a very significant feature. Machine learning is usually great if there doesn't exist a optimal solution or the optimal solution would be too difficult to calculate, but it is hard to argue for it if there's a possible optimal solution. 
Not a programmer so I suspect this code is not optimal and very sloppy &amp;#x200B; [Here's the github link](https://github.com/St0neA/Gaussian-Fitter) (I hope I've done this right this is the first time I've used it). &amp;#x200B; To use the program run the "main" file and left-click on the add button and then right-click on the peaks to select them. Then left-click on fit and it should attempt to find a fit. I haven't had it not work for me yet so I don't know what happens in this scenario. The 1996quarter and US1penny files are x ray scans from coins. You can change the data at the top of the "main" file. &amp;#x200B; The code actually writes to a .py file to create the function suitable for the number of peaks needed and then imports that file. I find it pretty amusing but couldn't find any other way of doing it. I know this is probably the worst ways of doing something like this so go ahead and roast me. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;

So, because I am unhappy with the Zillow api, I've started to work on a CLI that uses BS4 and requests to parse through specific URLs and look for data. The data will be based on user input. The data will be stored using a medium of the user's choice. Right now thoughts are: mongodb, mysql, excel, google sheets or a data json file. This way the data is available to the user in the most convenient way for them. The model for this data, which the scraper will look for will be: address, cost, zipcode, rooms, sqft, link, and unique indent made by some combination of those elements. There's more it'll do, but I'm at my warehouse job at the moment and need to get back.

I do in fact know the answer. But why do you ask it on here instead of trying to figure it out yourself? If we just gave you the answer without you trying to solve it yourself first you wouldn't learn anything... Also, r/learnpython is the subreddit you want to visit if you want to ask Python related questions.

Unfortunately, the programmer's requests are always tens or hundreds. Usually, the employer selects from this large number of candidates, for the first interview, only people with education and practice (which is of course bad). However, a good programmer must have a high IQ and an attempt to learn and know how to learn. Unfortunately, few or no companies will not pay for interviews with psychiatrists who will find out if the applicant has a really big IQ and whether he is interested in programming or whether he wants to do it just for money. Unfortunately, 90% of prgrammers nowadays do their jobs just for money and are not good at programming. IQ tests or logical tests are probably done only in companies in the Asian countries. In Central and Western Europe, everything is built on bureaucracy and papers (proof of education) and on money. It's a bit better in America, but it's just too easy in America. In America, just show what you know (your own projects, for example) :). &amp;#x200B; So, according to me, it also depends on the mentality of the nation where you are applying for employment :P.

What's "wrong" with Windows XP? Nothing specifically. However, it's missing a lot of more modern features, and became a huge sink hole in which to dump money when backporting things like security fixes and the like. It costs resources to maintain that just aren't worth the cost anymore. Same with Python 2.7.
A couple of things. 1. I also like the use of `all()`. I used it in a [response](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/aqrz1a/for_those_of_you_who_got_hired_to_work_with/egjul92/) elsewhere in this thread. It doesn't need numpy. Why not structure your non-numpy solution the same way? 2. This line: &gt; boxes = np.lib.stride_tricks.as_strided(grid, shape=(3,3,3,3), strides=(2*27, 2*3, 2*9, 2)) That isn't readable, and that's the key point in your numpy solution. I get it's re-structuring the data, but that's "clever" and so I don't understand how. As such it would require explanation.
Yeah, you probably had a Python installation in which something that depends on `cryptography` was installed at some point, so it appeared to just incidentally be there.
Ask circle-jerk questions, get circle-jerk answers
*Python 2.7: print “Hello, world!” *Python 3: print(“Hello, world!”)
1. how? rows and columns are easy enough but i don't see an equivalent way to get the boxes without numpy? 2. fair - that line definitely requires a comment, though i think (with comment) that that if speed was important and numpy (and nothing else) was allowed the intent is clear enough that i would use this version. Would you consider that a black mark?

Still, in some circumstances Python2 can be faster than Python3.
In these cases, you probably shouldn't be using Python.

Disney is known to use python. This is a little nod to python. Disney has developed a game engine in mostly python called Panda3D. I think they may have also sponsored Blender 3D which has python embedded.
&gt;Web ? Django/Python ? FWIW, I just got a Flask job. The company is migrating from Django. I've never had a Python job before, let alone many web developer positions, yet I'm wondering what the Python web dev ecosystem is like with Flask now hitting 1.0.
I'd write a generator function to generate indices for the blocks, a bit similar to what you do in your python loop above, but I'd abstract it. Get the "clever" stuff out of the logic that's concerned with the main idea. That's kinda what you have with the as_strided call, but there's several carefully chosen numbers in there. It's a bit too "line noise" in the main code path for my liking. If you came up with that in an interview. I'd be impressed, but I'd want you to hand walk me through it. Comments are for exactly this sort of thing, so in a code base I'd be fine with it if properly explained. 
Site specific bot ing is hard to to talk about online because it really is secret sauce. I’ve written large scale scrapers using PyWebkitQT. I’ve written chrome controlling bots designed to blend into machine learning user analysis to appear as a trusted user. Instagram is a good learning experience. There’s a really poorly done unofficial library(really it’s a port of a PHP library so it’s not pythonic) that’s not so complex it can’t be rewritten (which you should do). Instagram has both minute to minute ratelimits and daily rate limits, as well as sod and hard banning features for exceeding them. It’s a nice, forgiving site to scrape that features mild versions of common methods to stifle bots. 
It also has statements immediately following a sys.exit(-1)

Let me quote [Joel here](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2006/09/08/sorting-resumes-2/), when explaining one of the things he's looking for in resumes is diversity. &gt; Before I start a massive flame war of international scope by using the loaded term “diversity,” let me carefully define what I mean by this. Specifically, I’m looking for people who come from enough of a different background than the existing team that they are likely to bring new ideas and new ways of thinking to the team and challenge any incipient groupthink that is likely to keep us boxed into our own echo-chamber way of thinking about things. When I say different background, I mean culturally, socially, and professionally. Someone who has a lot of experience with enterprise software may bring useful diversity to a team of internet programmers. Someone who grew up poor is going to bring useful diversity to a startup full of Andover preppies. A stay-at-home mom rejoining the workplace may bring useful diversity to a team of recent graduates. An electrical engineer with Assembler experience may bring useful diversity to a team of Lisp hackers. A recent college graduate from Estonia may bring useful diversity to a team of experienced management consultants from the midwest. The only theory here is that the more diverse your team is, the more likely that someone on the team will have some experience in their background that allows them to come up with a different solution.
But not the other way around 
Yea they were very accurate with that movie.
The issue I think is that you're considering the skill of separate people instead of the skills of the entire team combined. Some guy might be extremely good at what he does but not really improve the output of the team as well as somebody with a different background providing new insights would. 
Hi , Any idea how the python language can be useful at a law firm. I am currently enrolled in a beginners course to learn how to code using python. What useful skills can I demonstrate that it would bring to the firm? 
some ml model i guess
This is the basic version, https://github.com/benz3k3/petl-configurable
No. Multiple inheritance is when a subclass inherits from two different base classes. ```python class BaseClass1: """BaseClass1""" class BaseClass2: """BaseClass2""" class Subclass(BaseClass1, BaseClass2): """subclass""" ``` This is useful for the "mixin" pattern, for example.
Thanks!
https://github.com/benz3k3/petl-configurable is basic one, you can add error handling, copy one column from file to multiple columns in database.

thanks! Adblocking sounds pretty interesting. btw, you are missing a colon after 'https' in your url. It leads to http://www.https.com which is some home improvement site and I was very confused haha. The url should be https://pi-hole.net/ 
You should provide a link in your original post, instead of forcing people to read though comments that might go deeper.

You can’t use the features introduced in Python 3.x. Some of which are very convenient. Python 3 is nearly 11 years old. It’s ridiculous to not be using it by now.
Actually I posted the wrong video link! Here is the right video - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OcWelTE7pA&amp;t=4s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OcWelTE7pA&amp;t=4s) Sorry for inconvenience!
that link is dead, but vfxplatform.com seems to be the right thing.
My guess is that the following if statement wasn't supposed to be contained in the one with the sys.exit, but the file was "corrupted" or "encrypted ". (I haven't seen the movie)
The thing I struggled with was Python3's string handling (which is now unicode). Something as simple as counting the amount of characters in a file was reasonably slower on Python3 compared to Python2. Here are some timeits: » python3 -m timeit 'sum([len(line) for line in open(".zsh_history")])' 1000 loops, best of 3: 882 usec per loop » python2 -m timeit 'sum([len(line) for line in open(".zsh_history")])' 1000 loops, best of 3: 587 usec per loop I wonder if there are ways to do this as fast in Python3. Maybe there exist some package like numpy for string handling? I haven't found it yet, but maybe I should present this issue to this community one day since most people seem to disagree with me.
You should use `import sys` `!conda install --yes --prefix {sys.prefix} tweepy`
Do you use this to make bets?
This is also true :)
There is an issue throughout with `__` being replaced with `**` (look for code like `__name__`).

It often surprises me how inefficient some of these studios are run, but given profit margins are thin it makes sense that studios aren't likely to get executive teams with the right forward thinking / long timescale strategies. It's always about the next production, little beyond that.

Well, they are using `argparse` above when setting up the various flags. 
There are lots of approaches to solving computing problems. PySimpleGUI is trying to solve a subset of the GUI problems. 80% is a nice target. But it is not the solution to every GUI problem. And it may not solve the GUI problems it does solve as well as some other architectures. What PySimpleGUI is good at is ***getting the job done.*** This is where it is targeted and where it excel. I'm not sure how to answer the question of *isn't it easier*, or *even better*, when I've not worked with those technologies. It appears you have worked with using a webserver, django, and celery to do GUIs. How about we choose a problem and do it then we can see what the differences are in the implementations? *I would really like to know / understand how the approaches differ.* I'm sure something will be learned. **PROBLEM** How about we do a simple form that has an interaction that is displayed on the page. It takes an input field and 3 buttons. The 3 buttons are labeled Red, Blue, Green. When the user clicks one of those buttons, the text the user typed into the field is displayed at the top of the window in the color of the button. I don't know. It's a stupid problem. I just grabbed a few GUI elements and an interaction (button to color). We can do some other problem if you want. Just keep in mind that PySimpleGUIWeb doesn't have support for Tables yet. Images were just added yesterday so Widgets are getting completed one by one. So I can't do a database read followed by display using a fancy table. I can make a table using text or input fields though so it could be faked. Lemme know what you think would be a good way to compare.

Ideally, opening the file as a bytes stream should solve that issue. The underlying issue is what counts as a character? Depending on your language that could be more than one byte and could also depend on the context of those bytes. So while it might slow down some cases like reading a plain ASCII file, it makes others possible. If you only care about ASCII characters, then you should declare that and work with a bytes string. I ran the same code you did in Linux Deploy (away from home) and saved 35% of the time by declaring binary in open(). I couldn't compare to Python 2 because it wasn't installed and discovered I can't access the internet in the chroot (a problem for another day lol). A long time ago, when I was working in Python 2 exclusively, I was using different character sets a lot (one of programs I wrote caught on in China) and was constantly crashing with decode errors just doing normal things. The dedicated type for bytes was actually a really nice change for me and made working in those scenarios much easier, though I know some people hate it.
/r/learnpython Also, there's dozens and dozens of commonly used modules and what you will probably end up using depends on the path your career takes you.
Probably in discovery. You can use python to sort and search for similar documents. I suspect a lawfirm might already have dedicated programs that do this though. 
A lot of the most important Python is what runs in the embedded runtimes inside of big applications like Maya and Houdini, and there's no really good way for them to simultaneously embed both Python2.x and Python3.x into the same process at the same time. So if Maya flips to Python3, it would be *only* Python 3, which would be disruptive, and give some studios a reason to switch to Houdini until they get their pipeline code updated, etc.
Thank you. Yes they have eDiscovery. I’m reading about Machine Learning practices and the application of Text Analysis as part of the discovery process which can help by allowing certain tasks such as languages detection of documents, entity extraction, concept extraction, summarization and classification to be conducted automatically.

Ah, I never thought this was possible. It is indeed getting quite close now: » python3 -m timeit 'sum([len(line) for line in open(".zsh_history", "rb")])' 1000 loops, best of 3: 681 usec per loop » python2 -m timeit 'sum([len(line) for line in open(".zsh_history", "rb")])' 1000 loops, best of 3: 598 usec per loop I wonder if in later releases of Python3 it is getting better. (This is Debian python3.5.3, but I only have crappy Python3.7 installs.) 
At the start of LPTHW the author tells you pretty much his teaching method and to whom the book is meant for. If you find his teaching method something that you can agree with, then keep with it. I did. When I first started I tried a few different books but none worked for me as good as LPTHW did. Most of the negative comments I hear about the book and author are for comments the author made a long time ago or about people who don't like the way he goes about teaching you. Is not a bad book. But then again, people have very strong opinions about how to learn something based on what they did and what worked for them.
The screenshot is from the perspective of a computer virus, so that's presumably the virus' internal code executing - particularly the bit about inspecting for vulnerability. 
sorry I just read the error. . . Have no idea what your package provides or how to configure it. This is a group about writing/enhancing python, not application support, unfortunately. Will need to do some research about what groups support that application. 
Ok thanks for the help! 
AFAIK Houdini is also part of vfxplatfrom so they would migrate at the same time (that's the point of the platform, follow standard sets of runtimes and libraries so studios doesn't have to deal with different versions). 
In this case the problem is not from the studios, most of which are ansious and ready for Python 3, but from the software makers. 
The folks who worked on Panda probably didn't have much interaction with the feature animation folks. Disney's a big company, there isn't a ton of interaction between all the various parts. But WDAS definitely also uses Python -- It's basically impossible to make a feature without using Python at some point. Perhaps more interestingly, some of their open source work like Partio comes with Python bindings, if you are curious to get a closer look at what they are using it for: https://www.technology.disneyanimation.com/collaboration-through-sharing
Each release has included performance enhancements in one way or another. I know Python version 3.4-3.6 were optimizing dictionary storage (which is the backbone of Python so it should've helped a lot), 3.6 added the f-strings, and 3.7 optimized type hints. I also think they have been working on inlining some argument handling in built-in methods/functions which should also boost performance.
The transition will be a shit show. So much untested code that needs to be converted in DCCs and proprietary code.
good bot!
Ever try to code anything with encodings? Just trying to print a string can run it through 2 layers of encoding/decoding. The errors for unicode are often backwards leading to people that don’t know what they’re doing just randomly flipping an encode to a decode. Nothing else is even worth discussing.
Many of which have been backported. I’ve yet to find a killer feature, yet alone something that isn’t easily worked around, in python 3. With numpy, scipy, and matplotlib recently dropping support, I expect one in a year or so. I write 2/3 compatible code that I test in both. I use the six and pathlib2 modules. I also support pyqt4, pyqt5, PySide, and PySide2 with the same code using qtpy. Also, python 3 wasn’t worth using until python 3.5. 3.4 was the first version that was even easy to write 2/3 compatible code, so yes 11 years, but only 4 of those were worth using.

Yeah. It’s easy with pickle. Look for pickle.1.obj in some folder. Then have a command line argument giving the code start location.
1% Chance: use random.randint(1, 100) to give 100 possible values, check for equality with any one (for example `if randint(1,100) == 1` Do that for each Element and remove it if True Then again with the same method: use insert and your value you'd like to insert - your index is simply `randint(0, len(your_list) - 1)`
So then how do you pickle stack / heap while ensuring the entire state of the program at a given line is stored, then how do you set the stack / heap from python? 
You shouldn’t piclkle the stack. That’s a complete waste of resources and will be slow (not to mention there are things like files and functions that are unpicklable). Stick all of the required downstream variables into a dictionary and pickle that. Then unpack them to reload the data.
boxes are the best! &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
Thanks! That didn't quite work for me but I was able to figure it out with: import sys !{sys.executable} -m pip install tweepy (Just wanted to reply with my solution in case anyone else needs it down the road lol)
literally did this last night to explain how 2 and 3 dimension arrays work to co-worker.
Do you know why the first one did not work? Package was not available on conda?
thanks! but i think that's what i've done so far. logically it's fine but I would have to expand this for 16 different values which would add up to about 60000 lines of code i think. this is what i had before: a = randint(1,100) b = randint(1,100) c = randint(1,100) for i in range(randint(1,randint(1,16))): i += 1 a1.append(randint(1,randint(1,32))) if a==1: del a1[0] if (b==1)&amp;(len(a1)&gt;0): del a1[0] if (c==1)&amp;(len(a1)&gt;0): del a1[0] else: if (c==1)&amp;(len(a1)&gt;1): del a1[1] else: if (b==1)&amp;(len(a1)&gt;1): del a1[1] if (c==1)&amp;(len(a1)&gt;1): del a1[1] else: if (c==1)&amp;(len(a1)&gt;2): del a1[2]
How would you do `pop()` ?
sorry bad formatting... a = randint(1,100) b = randint(1,100) c = randint(1,100) for i in range(randint(1,randint(1,16))): i += 1 a1.append(randint(1,randint(1,32))) if a==1: del a1[0] if (b==1)&amp;(len(a1)&gt;0): del a1[0] if (c==1)&amp;(len(a1)&gt;0): del a1[0] else: if (c==1)&amp;(len(a1)&gt;1): del a1[1] else: if (b==1)&amp;(len(a1)&gt;1): del a1[1] if (c==1)&amp;(len(a1)&gt;1): del a1[1] else: if (c==1)&amp;(len(a1)&gt;2): del a1[2] print 'a1 =', a1 
You're possibly better off doing more traditional single point cross over [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossover\_(genetic\_algorithm)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossover_(genetic_algorithm)) in part of your genetic algorithm.

&gt; PackagesNotFoundError: The following packages are not available from current channels: &gt; &gt; Ah no, that meant it was not able to install tweepy through conda.

Many popular packages are will be available on both, but it seems you hit on one that is not available on conda.

'LuRNinG 2 CoDE' is the last thing an employee should pursue without a problem to solve. Are you saying you have a gauranteed job at said lawfirm?
I am not saying that it doesn't solve any purpose, I regularly use pyqt to create GUI using python and I really like it. what I want to know is, is it going to be easier to write the same interfaces using webserver, It is difficult to write something like GUI using django and everything because you also need to know basics about frontend too. With the method I mentioned one needs to learn how to use multiple libraries. I have realised that there are multiple points of failure for a simple application and too much boiler plate for small projects. If you want to compare I can create the project using the things I mentioned but it will be an overkill. Now I can see where this lib shines.
I'd place boxes outside of the list and put arrows to them instead. This'd also explain references.
Removing elements where each element has a 1% chance of removal is fine. Here's how you can do it. import random def remove_elements(gene, probability=0.01): """ Removes chromosomes from a gene with the given probability :param gene: A List of chromosomes :param probability: The probability that a given chromosome will be removed :return: New gene """ return [chromosome for chromosome in gene if random.random() &gt; probability] You need to think about what you mean by having a `1% chance of adding elements in between, start or end`. Your current statement is not clear enough to be converted into code.

I agree that going with a unit test approach may be easiest option here, but I still am going to look into this because it would save me a ton of time longterm. I work in datascience, so a big problem with unit testing is that for any set of input the result may be slightly different depending on the day (new model trained 1+ time a day). My solution there was to try and design all models to be contained in a class so all input data can be controlled. I then made a python decorator that captures a functions input / output and saves locally. This lets me then create a model in a test case that behaves predictably and I have a list of sample predictions to test against. This still was super helpful, just a little tedious. Hopefully one day I will have the time to expand on that and make it automatically generate test cases too.

thanks! it works! but i don't quite understand the "x for x in y" or how that returns the mutated list btw what i meant is, after any elements have been removed from the first part, there is a 1% chance of a new element (eg randint(1,32)) being added to the start of the list, plus a 1% chance of an element being added between s[0] and s[1], plus a 1% chance of a new element between s[1] and s[2], etc. up until there is a 1% chance of adding a new element at s[len(s)]
I would make the array for insert grow from 3 to 4. I was seriously second guessing myself looking at this, since I assumed the argument array for each call was always length 3. 
I prefer to live in my imaginary world where MS hasn't tried to create a software language or really anything at all.
you ever fiddle with dir()? dir(list) and dir(list.pop) can be quite enlightening for newcomers that enjoy bunny warrens.
I am also no big fan of MS, but C# is pretty decent.
Really cool. /r/penmanshipporn material too
Great for when 'the dumbs' kick in, and I can't even remember my name anymore... Thank you. Can you make more of this, especially with name bonding examples?
From [https://docs.python.org/3/library/optparse.html](https://docs.python.org/3/library/optparse.html) "Deprecated since version 3.2: The optparse module is deprecated and will not be developed further; development will continue with the argparse module."
This is great and all, but try to take a data structures class in Java or C++ (they actually don't teach data structures in Python I believe) because you can get a better understanding of different data structures and algorithms like HashMaps, Stacks, Queues, and such. Don't get me wrong, I love Python, but most of my compSci classes were taught in Java and C and when I learned Python recently I was like "woah, this is way easier....", lol.
Same here 🙂
Anesthetic and concise, nice work!

The way you’ve wrote it the code will never finish because you’ll keep extending the list for all eternity.
and read the sidebar when you get there.
Need more of these in my life.
Can you do one for classes?!
rtfm
I highly suggest "Sololearn" on Android. Not just python but all languages. It also has a friendly community with lots of projects you can run from your smartphone. 
Sure
as someone that is still learning python more of these would be amazing. ive been having really hard time with classes to, can u @ me when u do it please?
Well...
Please think thoroughly before saying that a movie featuring main characters traveling through the internet in packets id bad! I would say it's an original movie
"does a simple thing well" and "solves one of the most common problems" don't go well together. Printing is a relatively solved problem by now don't you think?
There are all kinds of machine learning applications that will take over the legal industry and law enforcement, from facial recognition to writing style linking. 
Whoops!
is every fucking post on this sub some sort of fucking "tutorial" or "cheat sheet"
Well why dont you share something intresting That would be nice 
Sorry, I'm still very new to this. If I were trying to delete the work "Anesthetic", why would it be: `del string[1]` instead of `del string[0]` ? I would have thought string\[1\] was the word "and". Or did I miss a joke? Very possible. Subtlety is lost on me here right now. :)
Lists have a useful method called `pop()`. This will remove the index passed to it from the list, shift the remainder of the list down one, and return the popped element. `del` will just do the removing and shifting, without returning. So in my case, instead of removing the entire word, I'm just removing the letter 'n' from 'Anesthetic' to make 'Aesthetic'.
yes please, could never really understand classes so i've been writing everything the long way
OH! Okay, that totally makes sense now! And I was just reading about this stuff last week! Sheesh! I seriously need more tutorial sheets like this! LOL &amp;#x200B; Thank you!
No problem! Make sure you catch my edit and review the original post so it's nailed down :)
So Cython is another interpreter? Any downsides?
The example you showed with the asterisks is too vague because any of those asterisks could have been removed, it’s not obvious that the last one was the one removed
Yes, but not rely on it 100%, just as a validation because there are other factors like weightcut, stance, mind games, fatigue, etc. Note that the model is mostly using numerical variables :)
again see the comment you replied to. [ * , * , * ] -&gt; [ * , * ] (returns) value of list[2] 0 1 2 0 1 That should clear it up a bit more.
working on my flask server, : https://github.com/Abemarkar23/Quizer
Honestly, if documentation were written this way I’d understand it way easier 
No, I still don’t get what you mean. I took a python data structures course and it was great. Not saying it’s the best language to learn data structures with (I’m also not saying it’s not) but please elaborate further 
&gt;1.belongs in /r/learnpython &gt; &gt;If you are about to ask a question about how to do something in python, please check out /r/learnpython. It is a very helpful community that is focused on helping people get answers that they understand. &amp;#x200B;
From the [Cython docs](https://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/tutorial/cython_tutorial.html): &gt; The fundamental nature of Cython can be summed up as follows: Cython is Python with C data types. &gt; Cython is Python: Almost any piece of Python code is also valid Cython code. (There are a few Limitations, but this approximation will serve for now.) The Cython compiler will convert it into C code which makes equivalent calls to the Python/C API. &gt; But Cython is much more than that, because parameters and variables can be declared to have C data types. Code which manipulates Python values and C values can be freely intermixed, with conversions occurring automatically wherever possible. Reference count maintenance and error checking of Python operations is also automatic, and the full power of Python’s exception handling facilities, including the try-except and try-finally statements, is available to you – even in the midst of manipulating C data.
was thinking the same thing. 
Need to know a bit more info first: &amp;#x200B; * What is the operating system you intend to use for this? * Is Outlook the installed program or is it the web app? * If the email IMAP or POP3? 
Maybe, but I'd argue it's not really necessary. I wrote up a quick demo app that shows the very basics of putting a python app into a docker container. [You can find that here](https://gist.github.com/kryptn/9c73ab0983e0f869fe2ce718e70d822a) I use a variation of that dockerfile everywhere I've deployed python in a container, it doesn't get much more complex until you add non-python or OS dependencies. 
For classes learn about the constructor method __init__. Learn what the difference between args and kwargs, and then what self does inside of functions. This gives you 80 percent of the knowledge you need to know. YouTube has socractes which is a programming channel. Great intro to classes.
Yeah it feels like this sub has become a CS101 class. /r/learnpython would be perfect for all of these kinds of posts
Though it's already been answered, a helpful tip for inserting variables into a str is to use f-strings (Python 3.6+) or `str.format()` (all currently maintained versions). So, you could do `ans = input(f"What is {num1} + {num2}?")` in 3.6+ or `ans = input("What is {} + {}?".format(num1, num2))`
Break your problem down into smaller problems and solve each one. &gt;I’m still quite new to programming Okay, you've identified one problem, now lets solve it. You want to: &gt; go through the desired folders, print the PDFs attached to the emails, and flag messages that have already been printed. Research the `email` package for that task, then you have to find out if the e-mail contains an attachment, attachments are probably just a special kind of list, which means you can query it and look for PDFs, afterward, you can construct another List of e-mails that had the attachment you needed and printed. Start from the bottom, if you don't know how to work with `List`, then find out how, find a good tutorial and try it out. I doubt you're going to find a script that does exactly that, because the problem is too specific. 
Are you asking how to a) Do the regression? or b) Plot the results?
Thank you, as someone who is in highschool, works a bit and practices a sport for like 5 hrs a day and thus having almost zero time to learm coding (which i will need for college soon) having little pointers/tips like this helps a lot
I was reading slightly non-english documentation the other day and it took me a while to sort out that I was getting back a list of tuples, then the number of tuples then the number of items in the list. Boxes would've helped. (Using python more often would have helped, too.)
\&gt; For the uninitiated, Tree Shaking is a concept that has been floating around in the world of NodeJS webdev for about a year and a half now. &amp;#x200B; was a thing in google web toolkit long before the dude that wrote node got his first computer.
And way more helpful for learners who mostly read [/r/learnpython](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython) and would miss out on nuggets like this.
Since you are the OP, what would be a nicer way of saying that a post like this belongs in /r/learnpython? Or was him using rough language the issue? It would be cool if Mods were able to move posts about basic language syntax, but with how many are put here it would add a lot of work to an already busy job.
This sub has been degenerating into hot garbage at a remarkable rate....
yeah when I get stuck on something like this, I break out a notepad and start writing what I expect should be getting the compare that to the actual results/errors. Then comes the fiddly bit of breaking and slapping back together until it make sense and the errors stop or my results match what I expect. was fiddling about with unicode yesterday and took me nearly 3h to figure out you have to encode to utf8 then decode to the escapes. kept getting back byte encoded values or errors about mixing types. Was midlly irksome. Finally got to this point though. for i in range(boxdraw['lo'], boxdraw['hi']+1): j=str("\\u"+str(hex(i))[2:]).encode('utf-8') print(str(j)[5:-1]+"\t"+ j.decode('unicode_escape'),end='\t') if not k % 5: print('') k+=1 print() 
Some ideas for improvements: &amp;#x200B; * Make an actual `helmstack` package directory to make the setup more future proof * Link to PyPI from README * Make sure you tag every release you do here : [https://github.com/tonsV2/helmstack/releases](https://github.com/tonsV2/helmstack/releases) * Missing LICENSE makes most people to shy away from a repo. You need a LICENSE in the git repo and a classifier in [setup.py](https://setup.py) for that * Missing classifiers in [setup.py](https://setup.py) in general. Is this a python 2 or python 3 package? * Author/maintainer email in [setup.py](https://setup.py) * Missing projext description on PyPI is a negative. You can include [README.md](https://README.md) as a long\_description * No repo description (top of the page on github) &amp;#x200B;
The title had me thinking this was something about a new rapper. Then I saw it was r/Python and realized how much that industry has dominated the 'Lil' prefix.

I wanted to hack on some python this weekend, more specifically to learn PyGame and build something in it. I ended up spending the weekend building a sweet calculator that generates random polygons and determines whether certain ones are overlapping certain other ones at any given time: &amp;#x200B; [https://github.com/mobusdorphin/BulletPy](https://github.com/mobusdorphin/BulletPy)
This looks awesome. I enjoyed the interactive aspect of this that you created! I did a blog post on fitting these sorts of functions about a year ago [https://chrisostrouchov.com/post/peak\_fit\_xrd\_python/](https://chrisostrouchov.com/post/peak_fit_xrd_python/)
if its exchange/office365 i would use https://pypi.org/project/O365/ imap and the rest are painful learning curves.
Excellent shading!!!
Aaaaaaand saved. Thanks man
Use a convolutional neural network, it should get you a pretty good validation accuracy (Assuming you are using the MNIST dataset)
Fuck that. Encoding is a plague, but I kind of feel like our move to higher level languages doomed us on that front. Fair price, but still annoying. I'm dealing with the UI API of some CAD software inside a secure environment without stackoverflow (or any internet) access. And I don't code all that much lately, so it's been interesting remembering both python and learning a new API. Though they honestly did an amazing job considering how poorly they could have handled it. It's the values in a (UI) table that I *set* with strings delimited via newline if done in the user interface builder or a list of strings if done in code for row and column headers then a list (rows) of lists (columns) of doubles for the actual values. When I ask for values I get (list[tuple()], numrow, numcol) or something. The order threw me off (I'd expect the list of tuples last) then the difference between the way the information is set and how I access it.
Not a typography maniac here but I like your handwriting. 
I'll try it out. Thanks for the suggestion!
I love this. Would appreciate more. 
I assume you are using the MNIST dataset. In that case, you can get away by just using 2 dense layers and get a validation accuracy of about 98%. If you need any help message me.
If you could go ahead and do this for all of Python.
Both 
Interesting, do you have a project page? :) 
Kite helps. Saves me a lot of time with modules, functions, methods, etc. Compatibleode, Sublime, Atom, PyCharm. 
I have an exam tomorrow. Thank you :)
Don't forget, you can pass "descending=1" to sort and it will reverse sort from "largest" to "smallest"

don't listen to the haters. if all of your pickle data can be trusted, then there's nothing wrong with using pickles. i use pickle to schedule jobs into a worker pool over redis, for example, but anything that takes a binary blob will work just fine. file system, database, whatever... but if you're going to want to share this data with other systems or users, pickle is not such a good idea. it's okay for "internal use" however. it's always going to be faster to load a pickled object than to reinitialize it from disk or a database, etc... that being said... if you're getting crazy with your pickles, then dill &gt; pickle https://github.com/uqfoundation/dill 
They just mean: [○, ○, ●] pop() [○, ○] ●
Using a set() of numbers is more elegant than using a list() in this case, because you can write: new_numbers = 426 set_of_numbers = set() # load your previous set of number here target_size = len(set_of_numbers) + new_numbers while len(set_of_numbers) &lt; target_size: r = random.randint(10_000_000, 99_999_999) set_of_numbers.add(r) rather than: r = random.randint(10_000_000, 99_999_999) if r not in list_of_nums: list_of_numbers.append(r) because set() automatically removes the duplicate numbers. You didn't mention how big your current list of numbers is, but as [/u/Wesabi627](https://www.reddit.com/user/Wesabi627) mentioned, set() (like dict()) will be A LOT faster if you have a large number of entries in your set/list. Using the code above, it took about 0.004 seconds to add one thousand numbers to a set() that already contained ten million numbers, but it took 189.849 seconds to do the same thing using the list, roughly 50,000 times slower. I didn't know that before today, so I'm glad you asked the question. 
Okay, here's one thing I don't understand. How are the chars in `CHAR_LIST` sorted? Something like "decreasing density"?
When i was in college everything was taught in C, because that's what the fucking dinosaurs teaching the class knew, and fuck learning anything new when you can just rehash the same material you've taught for the last 10 years.
What's the data look like? Can you post a small subset?
Why did I never think of this idea? Well done my friend
I can never remember if methods like sort or sorted do the sort in place or return a sorted copy.

i literally got into coding this week. I'm 40 and have never even touched on the basics. starting in python is actually petty rad. 
Trying to render textured 3d models in PyOpenGL. I can use pygame's objloader to load models that don't have a texture but I would like the textures as well.
There are several command line tools to convert a PDF to text. For example.... Pdf2txt and then there are tools in python you can use (pdfminer see link below)....and there is optical character recognition that is getting very good. I am sure you can find a way to get a txt or doc file that will have enough information that then you just reread/loop over the document and add your wrappers. Sorry I can't point you directly to something, but you will find a command line tool to get to your doc.

I personally haven’t had to use Cython, but it is in my opinion one of the best options out there for boosting your codes performance. Being able to leverage C functionality and compiling to machine code can have drastic impacts on the performance of your project, in a positive way. A fair number of popular data science toolkit’s, like the SciPy.org projects, rely on Cython. 
Posts like this are more akin to CS0. I acknowledge that this is apparently an unpopular opinion, because of the amount of praise this post if getting, but words like "append", "insert", and "sort" were chosen because they clearly and concisely convey the meaning of the operation involved. Like wtf doe you think "append" means if not "attach it to the end?" Having to dumb that down even further with boxes and visualizations is a bit much, no? 
Why bother labeling them when you can just make the popped element visually distinct such as in /u/WesAlvaro 's example?
There's also this subreddit: /r/dailyprogrammer/
Yeah, I'd say more just irrelevant than advanced

that's cool !
Thanks. That separated it into a nice array of strings. Now I just have to get rid of the `b'` and the `/r/n` that got parsed into it.

I'm taking a coding class and my teacher isn't the most helpful. I need to make a program that reads how many words, characters, and what the most used characters are (including space). I have the first part but I can't figure out how many letters are used. The code on the left is the text document one, on the right is one he did in class but didn't explain it that well. I know the answer I'm looking for is in there somewhere but this class is just an intro to programming in general not python.
More of these plz!
Workforce automation at its best. 
Does python do references/pointers? I thought it didn't?
Find a unique problem or something you find interesting and force yourself to solve it in python. Google, copy and paste until you can figure it out. Then, keep iterating it until you can condense the code to be as lean as possible Reuse the code for another problem by tweaking it. 
Yeah, Thats awesome!!
Less than a year, not a Dev, less than 3 Jr. Level, 5 plus senior. But it really doesn't matter. Most jobs just need you to know the basics and they'll expect you to learn the packages they use as you go

Well explanation! 
Thanks to nemom I was able to parse the array of data. &amp;#x200B; Here's the code I came up with to connect to a serial connection and grab raw byte data from it using readline() and format the 128 hex numbers: &amp;#x200B; portName = "COM3" # replace this port name by yours! baudrate = 115200 ser = serial.Serial(portName,baudrate) rawdata = bytearray(2) # sets up a byte array to accept input 2 bytes in size rawdata = ser.readline() # burn junk data rawdata = ser.readline() # get actual data arr = str(rawdata).split(',') # split the line of CSV into an array of data first_number = str(arr[0]).split('\'') # the first number is b'XX so split it into an array of b' and XX value = np.array(arr) # turn list into a numpy array value = np.delete(value, [0,128], None) # delete first number b'XX and last item \r\n value = np.insert(value, 0, first_number[1], None) # reinsert the first number print(value) ser.close() outputs: ['1F' '3E' '5D' '7C' '9B' 'BA' 'D9' 'F8' '117' '136' '155' '174' '193' '1B2' '1D1' '1F0' '20F' '22E' '24D' '26C' '28B' '2AA' '2C9' '2E8' '307' '326' '345' '364' '383' '3A2' '3C1' '3E0' '3FF' '41E' '43D' '45C' '47B' '49A' '4B9' '4D8' '4F7' '516' '535' '554' '573' '592' '5B1' '5D0' '5EF' '60E' '62D' '64C' '66B' '68A' '6A9' '6C8' '6E7' '706' '725' '744' '763' '782' '7A1' '7C0' '7DF' '7FE' '81D' '83C' '85B' '87A' '899' '8B8' '8D7' '8F6' '915' '934' '953' '972' '991' '9B0' '9CF' '9EE' 'A0D' 'A2C' 'A4B' 'A6A' 'A89' 'AA8' 'AC7' 'AE6' 'B05' 'B24' 'B43' 'B62' 'B81' 'BA0' 'BBF' 'BDE' 'BFD' 'C1C' 'C3B' 'C5A' 'C79' 'C98' 'CB7' 'CD6' 'CF5' 'D14' 'D33' 'D52' 'D71' 'D90' 'DAF' 'DCE' 'DED' 'E0C' 'E2B' 'E4A' 'E69' 'E88' 'EA7' 'EC6' 'EE5' 'F04' 'F23' 'F42' 'F61' 'F80'] &amp;#x200B;
You are having issues because you have a bytes object instead of a string. You need to convert bytes to str and you can do `rawdata.decode('utf-8')` . To get rid of extra whitespace on the ends in addtion (i.e. \\r\\n) you can do `yourstring.strip()` or `rawdata.decode('utf-8').strip()` &amp;#x200B; now that you have a str object split() will work as you expect. Now to convert the hex strings to ints. there is a built in way to convert hex to ints and it looks like this `int(bytes.fromhex('0F'))`. beware that if the hex string has a odd length the fromhex function will fail. if a string is odd then just add a zero in front. Example hex = '2E8' if len(hex) % 2: int(bytes.fromhex('0'+hex)) else: int(bytes.fromhex(hex)) 
That's great. Please make one for dict, set and tuple.
Glad it helped 🙂
🙂
Thank you
Im glad i helped
Hahaha thats alot of work my friend 
Sure
Hahaha thanks
 Nice !
Three extra thoughts. in this section rawdata = bytearray(2) rawdata = ser.readline() #burn junk data rawdata = ser.readline() you redefine raw data twice so the first line does nothing. it would be better as this ser.readline() # No need to assign junk data to anything rawdata = ser.readline() In your queston you asked for "the first 120 bytes" do you mean literal bytes becaue some of the hex strings are two bytes. Or did you mean first 120 values &amp;#x200B; Also this post should be on r/learnpython because r/python is for discussion of the python programming language and not programming help.
A 24 fps stream on a Raspberry Pi? How do you build these ultra-optimized models? That's an inference time of ~0.04s on a 1.2 GHz processor with 1 GB RAM. I didn't know such speeds were possible without any hardcore parallel computation. Do you mind sharing an authentic link if possible?
Wow! Amazing stuff there 
the verb inflections capture the distinction, as you just demonstrated
maybe u could make a different tutorials than youtube 
Udacity's intro to programming course in Python..it's free... should be good enough starting point.
This is similar to what I ended up using! I did numpy's set routines and then used numpy.random specifying the number of random numbers I needed. Then I used the numpy setdif1d to get only the numbers that differed between my original array (read in from file) and the new array and made an array from them. I don't have the code in front of me, so I can't really explain it well. I like your way of doing it and I'll probably change my code in the same style, thank you!
THATS REALLY COOL!

Repl.it is a website I used to learn python, and it didn’t really teach how to use each function it gave links to the website they used. However, some of them are oddly hard, or at least for me, and it doesn’t have a visual output so you won’t be able to make anything. Other than that I’d recommend it. 
Why do all help forms not allow u to post imgs?

I was directed to the right sub reddit after posting after posting. Sorry for the mix up!
[Already exists.] (https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html)
Now I'm intrigued to do this with emoji's.
Hah! I got downvoted for expressing [a similar opinion](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/9o3x81/large_collection_of_neural_nets_numpy_pandas/e7se8uk/) a few months back. The people upvoting cheatsheets do not actually want to invest time and energy into learning. "Oh, cool, a cheatsheet! This will provide me with a substitute for actually solving problems, and in the process, *learning!* I fucking hate learning, so I'm going to upvote this and pretend I learned it all through a cursory skim and bookmarking_it_for_later.jpg." The people who *truly* want to learn are probably not upvoting cheatsheet spam. Really, I think /r/python should ban cheatsheets and put some restriction on the continual onslaught beginner oriented content. Other programming language subs are a place for **professionals**. Even goddamn /r/cpp -- historically, the most CS101 programming language of them all -- frequently has top posts for experienced developers. Why not /r/python? To put it bluntly... this sub is pretty garbage.
[Found it](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/62ywro/pyemojify_ascii_art_emoji_using_the_senate_aka/?utm_source=reddit-android)
It certainly does! It's just not shown to you explicitly in the syntax. Certain primitive, immutable types such as strings and small integers are stored by value in Python, but objects are stored by reference. This is why it behaves like this: &gt;&gt;&gt; a = ['x', 'y'] &gt;&gt;&gt; b = a b.append('z') &gt;&gt;&gt; print(a) ['x', 'y', 'z'] Since `a` and `b` are references to the same list.
Basically an object is a bundle of variables grouped together and some functions that can be applied to them. A class is a "template" for making such objects pre-equipped with initial values for the variables and the ability to call those functions on it. Classes can also be grouped into a kind of "family tree" that lets the children do everything their parents do, but also to override functions or add functions of their own.
Python has reference data types. List is one of them. Actually it stores references to the objects it holds. That's why I'd like to put arrows instead. To avoid misunderstanding in future. For example, lest build a field for tick-tack-toe game: field = [['_'] * 3] * 3 Field looks like: [['_', '_', '_'], ['_', '_', '_'], ['_', '_', '_']] Now let's make a turn: field[1][1] = 'x' Your field becomes: [['x', '_', '_'], ['x', '_', '_'], ['x', '_', '_']] Why? Because when you multiply your list for row by three, you make a new list that has three 'pointers' to the same row list.
That was very aggressive, but you are right. It seems strange to have such an incredibly basic cheatsheet on this sub. This is only getting upvoted because it's visually appealing, which means it's not getting upvoted for being about python.
yeah they do

Hey I would like to join you....if it's okay with you then dm me
I'm using Cython a lot. It's a wonderful idea and a really effective way to speed-up dramatically the performance-critical parts of an application, to go around the GIL, to call C functions of external libraries. The are some downsides: it isn't Python, it is another language, and to be used effectively it requires the knowledge of C. Cython's author had to make compromises between the Python language features and the underlying C language limitations, but they always found a sweet spot. It deserves, to me, an official support from the Python code developers. &amp;#x200B;

You can start applying for jobs whenever. The worst they can say is no. If they do then you’ll have, at the very least, learned about some of your weaknesses and so can better focus your studies. As for when I’d call myself a Python developer or senior developer or whatever: I call myself what others call me. I called myself a senior developer when I was given that title. I called myself a full stack developer because others introduced me as such.
*You* don't (explicitly), but python certainly does under the hood. 
I made several projects as I learnt new things. I have posted few of em in my website....If you are interested in it then feel free to check that out. (btw the website is not monetized 😀) WebURL: https://absanthosh01.wixsite.com/pythonist And the project that I am proud of is Image-Text parser. It uses tesseract application and pytesseract wrapper to detect text in image. I made the application as a GUI so I don't need to use tesseract's features in console 😁.
A list of lists isn't quite a 2D array! You can get into trouble if you make that assumption. If you really want a 2D grid of values, the numpy library is the standard thing to use. 
Really interesting thanks and thanks for everyone reply me
You might find Ratcave useful: [https://github.com/ratcave/ratcave](https://github.com/ratcave/ratcave) For something simpler, pyglet also now has built-in support for loading 3D models (obj only for now), but it's not fully fleshed out yet. It is enough for a simple 3D viewer. 
Thank you, Mike! DM-ing you very soon. 
Thanks for your feedback!
Thanks for your feedback! &gt; Make an actual helmstack package directory to make the setup more future proof Would a folder structure like /helmstack/helmstack make sense? &gt; Make sure you tag every release here : https://github.com/tonsV2/helmstack/releases Any recommendation for a plugin or such which would easy the process? I usually use a gradle plugin to handle my releases &gt; Missing project description on PyPI is a negative. You can include README.md as a long_description A link to the readme, a note about seeing the readme or what do you mean?
It would be damned near impossible to write an efficient and generic approach to this. Serializing the entire stack / heap at any arbitrary point in the control flow would be extremely inefficient in the vast majority of cases, as well as ludicrously difficult if not impossible without direct access to the underlying interpreter machinery not usually available through Python itself. It also likely wouldn't be as useful in the majority of cases as a more finely tuned manual approach. Doing this on a case by case basis isn't nearly so hard... have a class that encapsulates the state of your program and then make that class pickle-able. A class method then is used to either find and unpickle a checkpoint or start fresh with a new instance. Sprinkle the act of checkpointing about where appropriate for your program, and you're done. But _what_ needs to be checkpointed and _where_ it's appropriate to do so is going to be very case-specific, hence difficult to write generic functionality for.
Not bad but you should improve the readme file.
This question is best asked in [/r/learnpython](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython). See notes on the sidebar. Good luck.

thank you, i would indeed!
You explained correctly :)

That's a list comprehension. https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions It is true that doing is the best way of learning. However, you should walk before you try to fly. You seem to be a complete beginner, and the project you've chosen seems way above your level. That is okay still, provided you take on the challenge and figure things out on your own. If however you're simply going to copy solutions off of forums like this, you won't learn anything. I'd suggest you take on a simpler project for now. Here's how you can do the adding chromosomes. def add_chromosomes(gene, probability=0.01): """ Adds chromosomes from a gene with the given probability :param gene: A List of chromosomes :param probability: The probability that a given chromosome will be added before any existing index, and at the end. :return: New gene """ to_add = [random.randint(1, 32) if random.random() &lt; probability else None for _ in range(len(gene)+1)] new_gene = [None for _ in range(len(to_add) + len(gene))] new_gene[0::2] = to_add new_gene[1::2] = gene new_gene = [chromosome for chromosome in new_gene if chromosome is not None] return new_gene
Been using Python professionally for over a decade now; web dev and data science are significant domains, but I wouldn't say either constitutes a "main", while "scripting" is so broad as to encompass the other two.
This is adorable. 
My thoughts exactly. I'm jealous of super clean handwriting.
Check out jupyter (previously ipython notebooks, i think) : [https://jupyter.org/](https://jupyter.org/)
Hats off to you: you clearly have more perseverance than me!
Thanks, I downloaded Kite and the Sublime editor before I finished that demo video, it looks great.
That's great. Thanks :)
You're going to _love_ the `chr` function, which bypasses all the encoding stuff: for i in range(boxdraw["lo"], boxdraw["hi"] + 1): print("%04x %s" % (i, chr(i)), end="\t" if ((i+1) % 8) else "\n")
Thanks for your light on pickle, i went to the database dark side since no one can't figure out what max size pickle can handle and after i had running my fetching script for 10 days i don't want to loose the 30 millions records i already got.
Haha thanks man! 
In all honesty it o ly took me 1 month but I started learning Python 8 years ago on and off

Okay if I understand correctly, you have 2 categories, A and B, A with a linear form on histogram and B other with gaussian form, and based on 24 hr data (timeseries?), it can either be class A or class B. Is this right?
&gt; was fiddling about with unicode yesterday and took me nearly 3h to figure out you have to encode to utf8 then decode to the escapes. It is 2019. How is there *anyone* who calls themselves a programmer who hasn't yet read [Joel on Unicode](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2003/10/08/the-absolute-minimum-every-software-developer-absolutely-positively-must-know-about-unicode-and-character-sets-no-excuses/) yet? The programming industry has a severe education problem.
\`\_\_init\_\_\` **is not** the constructor, it's (as its name suggests) an **initialiser** \`\_\_new\_\_\` is the constructor; it gets called implicitly when you do `SomeClass()` and, in turn it returns your newly created instance, which it then passes to \`\_\_init\_\_\` in the form of \`self\`.
snek
&gt; It certainly does! It certainly doesn't. The Python interpreter's virtual machine is implemented in a language which does pointers. The Python language doesn't. &gt; Certain primitive, immutable types such as strings and small integers are stored by value in Python All values, every single one of them including strings, small integers, None and bools, are objects in Python. There are no "primitive types" in the sense of machine primitives. No values are "stored by value", they are all objects. Implementations like PyPy may (or may not) play tricks with optimizing code to work with machine primitives, but they have to do so in such a way that there is no visible difference at the level of the Python language. 
&gt; For classes learn about the constructor method init. `__init__` is not a constructor, it is an initializer. By the time `__init__` is called, the object has already been constructed and exists. &gt; Learn what the difference between args and kwargs That's useful to know but it is not specific to classes. That's like me saying "Teach me how to drive a car" and you reply "Sure, first you need to know how to dress yourself..." Sure, I need to know the difference between args and kwargs, but that applies language-wide. Knowing args/kwargs doesn't tell you a thing about classes.
Not on this subreddit. It's basically 'how to hello world' 7 days a week.
&gt; The people upvoting cheatsheets do not actually want to invest time and energy into learning. In fairness, a cheat-sheet helps during the process of learning, or for libraries or areas of coding you don't use often enough to justify spending large amounts of learning time. Sometimes you just need to get the job done without investing three weeks in learning. But that doesn't apply to such basic fundamentals as list append. And you know what helps much more? Writing your own damn cheat-sheet that covers the parts you personally have trouble with. &gt; Really, I think /r/python should start by banning the following types of posts: &gt; &gt; Cheatsheets &gt; I'm new to programming! Look at what I made! &gt; Automate the Boring Stuff advertising &gt; Image-only posts (these are almost always low quality) Yes especially the last. As far as I'm concerned, anyone posting a screenshot of code wothout a really good excuse should have their licence to use a computer taken away, unless they can prove that they edit their code with Photoshop. (And if they do that, it is punishment enough.)

&gt; Would a folder structure like /helmstack/helmstack make sense? helmstack/&lt;your modules&gt; and expose functionality though __init__.py definitely makes sense. &gt; Any recommendation for a plugin or such which would easy the process? I usually use a gradle plugin to handle my releases Just click the "Draft New Release" button and you should be fine :) &gt; A link to the readme, a note about seeing the readme or what do you mean?

&gt; In fairness, a cheat-sheet helps during the process of learning, or for libraries or areas of coding you don't use often enough to justify spending large amounts of learning time. Sometimes you just need to get the job done without investing three weeks in learning. I agree about the importance of being able to get stuff done quickly. But I've personally found the following strategies much more meaningful than cheatsheets: - Google! It's much quicker and well-tailored to your specific problem. You are also exposed to best practices and expert advice. - A tutorial/examples for the library in question. Shows you idioms and how the API is meant to be used. - API index. Comprehensive and complete. The issue is that cheatsheets (usually) do not have any of these benefits. At best, you skim over them to see what an API is capable of. But they're not study material. Learning happens when we sit down and attempt to solve a real problem or exercise using the strategies I listed above.
If ignoring the fact that I'm also taking into consideration that subs might be '' in my tests, I'd say it's enough... and also very smart!! Thank you so much for your amazing answer. Is this proper testing then? ```python def test_second_index(s: str, subs: str): res = second_index(s, subs) if res is not None: _logger.info(f'second_index("{s}", "{subs}") = {res}') assert ( s[:res].count(subs) == 1 and subs != '' ), 'there should be exactly one earlier occurrence of the substring before the index found' else: _logger.debug(f'second_index("{s}", "{subs}") = None') assert ( s.count(subs) &lt; 2 or subs == '' ), 'should only return None if the substring occurs less than 2 times' ```

Python has achieved substantial popularity and is also the fastest-growing programming language.​ As both programming and Python programming are trending, there is a big flood of newcomers to the field. That said, I wouldn't expect the case to be any other way without subreddit rules reinforcement.
I wrote a fully Python ecosystem of archiving capabilities using Python and the ability of Python to dynamically load modules from anywhere. It's called cronohub and is located here: [https://github.com/cronohub/cronohub](https://github.com/cronohub/cronohub). Right now there aren't that many plugins available, but hopefully this will grow in time. :) &amp;#x200B; I found that doing something like this in Python is massively awesome and fun to code up.

Hi! Sorry, I don't really understand the last part of the sentence. :/ You would use it to archive all of your repositories to a single specific location with something like ths above simple command. If you have a lot of repositories you might want to back them up from time to time to a defined location. As github might be around forwever but maybe you plan to move away from it, or just simply want the extra layer of backup.
pretty cool. you may find some inspiration in the zope component architecture. pyramid uses it internally and has several extension points that you can override by implementing the interface and registering it with the registry. typically people dont mess with it and it just works, but for the adventurous, the power it gives you is amazing.
This may cause some incorrect assumptions. List contain identical stuff, insert puts things in the middle etc. 
Thanks, you said owncloud, did you plan to allow nextcloud also? 
As a mather of fact, I do. I have it as an issue. :)
Thanks! Just took a (very brief) look at the zope component architecture and it looks really cool! For sure will put this on my list of things to investigate!
I agree with u/n1___ when is done share it on r/learnpython also many will appreciate it too. Also jupyter is a great tool but many of new learners will not use it. Don't forget the licence too, because if I want to use it to teach it at my colleague with out license I can't.

Thanks man!
Ah shizz... Mixing up my data types. This is what happens you’ve you spent your time learning C and haven’t touched Python in a while. ``` comment = list("Ksjsjshshaj") del comment[1] comment = str(comment) print("I hope this actually works now") ```
My initial though was why not just use a 'registry pattern' - no need to scan which classes are loaded and check if they're a subclass of your plugin base, they should just register themselves. See this SO for a very simple solution in 3.6: [https://stackoverflow.com/a/50099920](https://stackoverflow.com/a/50099920)
Thanks for pointing it out. Looks similar to the zope component architecture (where you also have registry). &amp;#x200B; For my usecase this is not the best option. For example, I want to apply a number of transformations on a given data source, where each transformation is defined as a plugin in my case. By just copying a new python module into the plugins folder, I automatically use this transformation the next time I run my application. &amp;#x200B; If I understand the registry pattern correctly, I would first need to have all of the transformations automatically register themselves (for which I would need exactly a similar code pattern as my current code)
Check out the new edit to my post. It actually works now, rather than being a dummy demo for the `del` command. 
Listen here u lil shit
So, what do you think? Was it worth the money? :)
The conference? Yes! the book? I won it and it's amazing!
Easy there
Yes, you don't need VirtualEnv, PipEnv if you are using Docker. Just install the stuff you need into a container, and that's it. The Python:3.7 base image will be enough for nearly every case.
This is my [template project](https://github.com/salimfadhley/dockerized_python_playground) for Dockerized python in IntelliJ / PyCharm
Hah nice. I just finished coding up cronohub's plugin architecture: https://github.com/cronohub/cronohub/tree/master/cronohub It uses dynamic module loading and an ABC as a base class for all plugins. Though it's a CLI so plugins don't have to register. They just need to be in the right folder with the right name and right structure. Composition over anything else. :) Neat stuff there man.
Just out of curiosity: Do you solve the LP-relaxation of the problem and round fractional results? Because I assume player picking is a combinatorial optimization problem which normally needs mixed-integer programming solutions.
What's missing is how to manage secrets. My recommendation is to use files, and an environment variable to set which file it should read each secret from, something akin to this, inside `config.py`: import os import logging _log = logging.getLogger() DBSECRET_PATH = os.environ.get(DBSECRET_PATH, 'secrets/DBSECRET') _log.debug("reading DB secret from: %s", DBSECRET_PATH) with open(DBSECRET_PATH, "rt") as f: DBSECRET = f.read() # Clean up after ourselves del _log, DBSECRET_PATH This allows you to use kubernetes secrets or other things to safely (well, not really) store data, but not expose it to the environment. The environment is _not_ secret and can usually be read and seen from other software on the same host, and other places. Do not store secrets in Environment variables even if the 12-factor app says it's easy to do. 
Use pycharm The best IDE
&gt; When i was in college everything was taught in C, because that's what the fucking dinosaurs teaching the class knew Same with my experience. They taught C so horribly and it was the first language I have learned and it was too low level and hard with all the memory allocation and shit. Most universities in the US teach DS in C++ or Java. Java is really verbose so I feel like I got a better understanding in it. For example, a hashMap in Java is like this: HashMap&lt;String,String&gt; streetno=new HashMap&lt;String,String&gt;(); streetno.put("1", "Sachin Tendulkar"); streetno.put("2", "Dravid"); streetno.put("3","Sehwag"); streetno.put("4","Laxman"); streetno.put("5","Kohli"); But in python, it is called a list with keys and it's like this: streetno = {"1":"Sachine Tendulkar", "2":"Dravid", "3":"Sehwag", "4":"Laxman","5":"Kohli"} I am not shitting on python, but I feel like for those who learn python first and then learn other popular languages like Java, it will be harder for them. Data Structures in C++ and Java are so similar that someone who learns the other will have a real easy time. Also, things like for loops. I believe that people should learn "proper" for loops first like so: for (int i = 0; i &lt; arr.length; i++) { result += arr[i]; } In Python: for x in "banana": print(x) Like I said, I'm not really debating here and putting Python down, I just feel your general programming skills will be stronger if you learn DS in Java or C++ first and then see how Python is similar. Of course this is an unpopular opinion on this sub, but going from Java to Python was easy for me. Now someone going from python to Java would have a more difficult time. II'll tag these users so they can see my point: /u/Slingerhd /u/schmidtyb43 /u/dethb0y If someone learned another language first and wants to chip in, then that would be cool. I'm not debating really, just giving my input. When I was taking DS I did ask my professor why they don't teach it in python and he gave me a similar answer.
If you are looking to build gui desktop apps Then PyQt5 is the best 
Tk is fascinating. It looks like shit and always has. How does it manage to stay around?
Why tho? 
Yeah the modules need somehow to be imported for them to be registered, which might again end up being pretty similar to what you've done. Apparently there are quite a few libraries to do simple plugin management out there, good reads. Implementing your own solution is always fun though, get the noggin joggin' :)
You should post questions to the r/learnpython subreddit. If you want to open/save a file you can use the [File dialog module](https://pythonspot.com/tk-file-dialogs/)
Yeah but that python example you gave of a for loop is the short hand version. There is a python for loop that looks very similar to the Java example you gave
Yes I totally agree with you Also with the libraries everything is pre made for you So we actually dont get enough idea what’s going under the hood Which is kind of not so good for the beginners who really want to get deeper into programming . 
Ah I forgot to include it on the guide. I will update it, thanks!
If the decision variables are: x_i = use player i, then the LP is just a knapsack problem and nothing fractional will be needed.
When I learned data structures in python we did learn everything under the hood, built out our own classes for the data structures etc
That's my point. You can't use LP if the variables are integer/binary.

Bet I could create a registry pattern for automatically loading the registry for the automatically loading the registry for automatically loading the registry for the .... StackOverflow :) &amp;#x200B; Agree with the implementing solutions yourself, it really helps you to get a deeper understanding but it is also a lot more fun :)
Cool, looks pretty similar to what I am doing :)
Yep. :) :) Pretty awesome stuff you wrote. I like it. :)
Ah crap complete brain fart. You're right!
I use a library called dash to do this. There’s a little bit of a learning curve to figure out how to structure your code, but I found it was easier than all the other alternatives. Just google dash Plotly to find it
So you would prefer your code to run for 20 hours instead of 20 seconds?
Looks like a fun concept. I'll be sure to check it out. I enjoy watching conference talks on Youtube. Hopefully I get the chance to attend one on the future. Not much of a python community here in Norway though. Maybe I'll attend one down in EU some day.
Thanks, I’ll look there then :)
Yes, `array.array` stores values values in a compact array. The difference from numpy is that numpy actually not only stores values in efficient data structures, it also implements all the numeric operations on these values. To add values in two `array.array` integer vectors in pure Python, you'd need to iterate them both, *convert them back to Python objects*, add them and *convert back to packed array*. That's what makes it slow.
Cuz for big lists something like 70k they are slow. In such cases you need to figure out a fast way to sort.
You can create one and if you invite the right people python will pay for it.
But can you use it as an android app with notifications? I was looking at dash as well but it looks like more of a dashboard on the desktop and that's it

I'm working on a cryptographic program with a multiple layers of symmetric-keys algorithms. It's my first big project and it helped me a lot to get a better handling at lists, mathematical transformations in a string by using ord() and chr(), modularity and strings/lists methods of course. The basic functions of the program are now assured and the inputs formatting methods are quite robust, my job now is to complicate the algorithm while ensuring the decoding functions. 
It'd only be for personal use. I tried to do some stuff with BeautifulSoup but I could never find anything with soup.findAll. 
You can use a CSS sheet to make the website mobile friendly - bootstrap has some a good predefined one. So yeah not a mobile app, but probably the quickest way to hack something together. As far as notifications, there’s a dash decorator that’ll let you wrap your custom function and call it at specified intervals, so you could define a function to send you an email or something if your criteria is met.
Create a blank dictionary. As you read through the file, if the entry in column 1 isn't in the dictionary, add it to the dictionary, add a blank set as the value, and add the entry in column 2 to the set. If the entry in column 1 is in the dictionary, add the entry in column 2 to the set. Sets automatically drop duplicate entries.
thanks, let me know if you have any improvement suggestions or run into any issues 
I think this behaviour can be effective, but I also think that once you go to too many levels, you're trying to create library-level functionality inside of one parent function. At that point, I'd say that this should all be split out into a logical file structure, and let that structure dictate the presentation of the interface, rather than scoping of functions
I can't even learn python in English, python in patois would break my mind. 
This is one of two tabs that open at start in my browser. The other is google.
who said that in the Caribbean people speak patois? There are many different countries with different languages.
This is true. I'm just used to speaking to my paternal family in patois

What’s the fast way to sort then? If the objects aren’t in a database, you’re not gonna get much faster than timsort, which is what both `.sort()` and `sorted()` use. 
I’d be using Windows, Outlook is the installed program, and I believe it’s IMAP (we have access across multiple devices) but I’m not certain.

I'll stand by my recommendation to \_not\_ put secrets in the environment. 
Do i need to learn how to use scrapy, i already have a good grasp of beautifulsoup and selenium to booth, i recently completed a project that needed both, you can check it out here https://github.com/vicodescity/autoscrapes.github.io. So back to my question, do you need scrapy?
Why would you want Google though? The address bar in your browser IS Google. 
It depends on the question. I am no expert. But I experienced that using this sort made algorithm quite slow.

Just save script 2 in the same folder or location at script 1. Then import script 2 into script 1. Then pass the list to whatever class or function is in script 2. Just create whatever function in script 2 to accept a list.
The second script might need to be rewritten to run this way. a.py... import b # or... from b import bFunc def aFunc(): name = raw_input("What's your name?") b.bFunc(name) # if importing from, then the previous line would not have the "b." leading. if __name__ == '__main__': aFunc() b.py... def bFunc(name): print "Hello, " + name if __name__ == '__main__': pass 
I think that’s what Firefox defaulted to.
I think there are very few hard-and-fast rules. Some are good but are also meant to be broken. Often when I think I want nested functions, a class is better. Even though, there are some cases where I have a class and then a function that makes the class and returns a value from it. But then there are time when a simple internal function is easier (often to avoid things like nested if statements.
You should actually fix it by adding some markdown. [text](link) [vfxplatform.com](https://vfxplatform.com)

You have to admit the creative visual representation of the information is much easier for a newer programmer to comprehend than what's essentially a user manual though...
Maybe [https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.defaultdict](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.defaultdict) is better than a standard dict, there are some really good examples at the link. Best of luck :-)
There are good reasons to use nested functions (ie, closures) but in your case I think you need to rethink. For example, you pass `array` down into every function but there’s really no need for that. The following code will work: def foo(x): def bar(): print(x) return bar() You see, you give the outer function x, and the inner function knows about it because it’s within scope. When you run `foo(69)` it will print 69 despite you not having passed the variable into `bar`. It’s a good idea to imagine that one function does one task. This isn’t a hard rule, but it will make things easier to understand and easier to modify later on. Your sort function for example, why does it need to know how to count things? Why does it need to know how to build an output thing? Why doesn’t the sort function, just sort?
Good insight, thanks. Wondering how much C knowledge you'd need. Also, without the GIL, does it handle race conditions well? I imagine that was thought of and it takes of advantage of how C would do it?
Run a profiler on your code. Look at which functions are taking up most of your time. Go to those functions and only those functions and rewrite them. If you don’t profile then there’s literally no point in optimizing because you’re just throwing darts at the board and guessing what is actually slow. 
ok cool i will test this but what is 'pass' in b.py?
Yes and no about google. I personally browse the standard library of any lang using Zeal, where I have the documentation available offline to me. It's a nice thing to have when the internet goes out.
2000+ upvotes for a pretty picture of append, insert, and sort? Jesus, is this sub full of non programmers or a circle jerk of designers who upvote anything that looks pretty?
Alright, I don't want to step too close, but how are you going into an interview where something this trivial could possibly be of any help? Did you just apply for a position that needs python without even knowing the most basic methods? 
Haha ofc not. But my native is c++ and some of these are really helpful when doing challenges. Probably not the most efficient tho. Still something to keep in mind if I'm stuck!

Wow I had no idea I'll look into that thanks
I wasn't taking anything you said in a negative way. You were pondering, speculating, questioning. I like those kinds of discussions as I learn from them. Do you have a small project that already uses the components you are speaking of that could be modified into a simple GUI problem? Or can you choose something that you can easily create using the technologies you mentioned. I'm simply looking for a problem we can agree on that we can implement, without taking days, that we can then compare. To be clear, it's not an ego-based challenge of some kind to you personally. I honestly want to know more about the other solutions out there. I know one technology well, PySimpleGUI, and the others not at all, so it's difficult for me to draw and direct conclusions on the good and bad things that may fall out of such a comparison. If you don't have time/energy, I get it. As you said, there may be a lot of overkill code required.
Perhaps you should take a look at [Invokes](https://www.pyinvoke.org/)?
&gt; this sub is honestly pretty garbage. Yes, I said it. Yeah I actually unsubbed after this post. /r/python should be for experienced python devs who want to discuss cool projects, design patterns, etc.
Look, I see this response among many moderators of technical subrdedits. Hell, I mod similar subreddits (not in coding). The fact is that you can't just put the onus on experienced users of your community to submit content among a flood of low quality posts like this one. It *has* to be up to the moderators to police basic high standards in content or the sub gets drowned out and you lose those high quality contributors. 
which was the more innovative - the box drawing or explaining that append means to add to the end?
You can't have a hypothesis (if) without a conclusion (then). So, `pass` is just a blank statement that does nothing but take up space. There could be other commands instead that do other things when the b.py script is called by itself, something like... if __name__ == '__main__': import sys args = sys.argv if len(args) &gt; 1: bFunc(args[1]) That way, you can run `b.py nemom` and if would pass "nemom" to the bFunc().
The former. Fact is that python doesn't have a good ratio of experts/novices compared to other more languages more actively used in SWE
The scenario I'm thinking of is more than one function in another function. At this point, the complexity is high enough that it should be split out into files. A function should be a relatively small, self-contained piece of code. One or a couple small helper functions is ok, but more than that, you're getting more complex than a function should be. Example: def sort(a_list, mode=0): def merge_sort(a_list): def merge(left, right): pass def selection_sort(a_list): pass def insertion_sort(a_list): pass if mode == 0: merge_sort(a_list) elif mode == 1: selection_sort(a_list) else: insertion_sort(a_list) Here, we're defining an internal sorting API, but it's all contained within a function. Yes, this is completely valid syntactically, but a function shouldn't be used for this purpose. This could be represented in a few ways, but maybe the sorting algorithms are defined outside the `sort` function, as small, self-contained algorithms. Or, a base sorting class could be defined with an abstract interface, and each algorithm defined as subclasses inheriting from that base, with a well defined interface and a self-contained implementation. One other note is that layers of functions makes code very difficult to test. I'm not sure if it's possible or not, but I don't believe that a nested function could be used outside that function, so it cannot be tested as one small unit. In my example above, to write a unit test for `merge_sort`&lt;, the entire `sort` function needs to be tested with specific arguments passed such that `merge_sort` is tested. By splitting the function out, it can be tested as one independent, self-contained function. Having many levels of functions ends up with very long functions and very large indentations. I would say this is similar to using one single file for an entire project: yes, valid, but not clean or easy to maintain. The code should be split into small, easily testable, logical blocks.
Learning the pandas library and how to program in general (chose Python as my first language)
Web accessible or just desktop?
You're hired lmao
 import subprocess def example(command, flag1, flag2, flag3, flag4): a = subprocess.popen([command, flag1, flag2], stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE) # Get the stdout/stderr and any error if one occured result, err = a.communicate() # Turn result to string instead of bytes. Not necessary but will probably save a few newbie headaches result = result.decode("utf-8") if "is not recognized as an internal or external command" in result: print("we here you can the other process again.") a = subprocess.popen([command, flag3, flag4], stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE) # And then we do the same as above. 
I've also started reading this- chapter 12 (Excel) is probably the most relevant in terms of how the world functions at the moment, and for me personally. Python scripts are a whole new world for me but it seems cool. Have you worked on similar projects before? 
So I'm just learning this noe, seems like the kind of thing I would have encountered and never figured out eff was going on. Is there a list of ways python acts like this somewhere? What if you want to "clone" the variables stored in the list?
I think a solid confidence of C basics is enough to immediately understand how and why Cython diverges from Python, and to exploit its features. A shallow grasp of how the Python interpreter works is also a plus. Cython allows the execution of code outside the GIL (enabling real parallel-running threads) simply forbidding any access to any Python if the GIL is not held, enforcing this at compile time. This could seem stupid, but it's actually pretty cool: if you're crunching numbers inside (fast!) C data structures or you're calling an external C library that has nothing to do with Python, you don't need the GIL. Also, the Cython code marked with the `nogil` keyword is essentially C written with a Python-like syntax: it gets translated to C almost 1-to-1, and I love it. If a brief access to a Python object is necessary, the GIL can be acquired just to perform this operation, and release it again immediately after. I'm working on a real-time audio processor; the access to the audio subsystem and the signal processing is done in Cython, all the control logic in standard Python.
Oh this looks like a good book! Gonna see if I can find it at the library! 
I am not really a core programmer in python. I am just using python for a Physics project. This module looks like a high-level library and I am having hard to understand it. Are there any application videos or articles related to this module. 
Companies have no idea what "python developer" means, so why call yourself one? Just say you're a developer. List python as one of the programming languages you know. If applying to a python position, list specific things they ask for in the job post.
Ok this morioh.com website seems to be spamming copied articles from other blogs and reposting them in hope for some ad revenue etc. This site should be banned, all they do is copy other peoples copyrighted stuff and republish them. 
It looks exactly what I wanted. I will apply this module and get back to you with updates. Thanks.
More please! Seriously, if you could just make a website full of your hand-drawn notes you would make it so much easier for people learning Python. This is extremely clear to people who are not familiar with Python. It reminds me of an app called Dragonbox ([https://dragonbox.com/](https://dragonbox.com/)) that I used to get my son to play to learn the concepts for algebra.
I updated my comment with an example based on your request. It doesn't have the timeout for each command. 
Useless
Awesome, I will try this code and update you soon.

Very cool. Why is the control logic done in standard python?
Did you mean flask?
Nice :-) I'd strongly recommend you look into pandas as doing this sort of thing is what it's for and it's extremely powerful.
Thanks man Im looking into it today only 
Quite interesting. Similar to a project I have been working on (also available via pip). Not sure how I feel about exceptions breaking the loop. 
Just let us know when you have the Python dream.
Thank you. That makes sense if that's how array works. JavaScript has a TypedArray data type and mathematical libraries usually use this data type to store the data for vector and matrix data type instead of Array which is what people usually use. I expected that Python array works like that and that's not wrong to infer. 
I just don't get people whining about why it shouldn't be here. All spectrum of users browse this sub! From novice to experts. This is not StackOverflow. This is a subreddit about Python and the above post is still relevant. There is absolutely no wrong in visualizing a simple concept with an intent to explain it. You either appreciate it or stop whining/policing/gatekeeping. I expect more contents like this.
Glad to hear you're enjoying it. Keep it up! 
I don't like code structured like this, because it has a larger capacity for bugs by closing over variables it should not close over. I generally only use nested function definitions if I explicitly want to close over 1 or more variables, and the resulting closure is exposed (think decorators, for example). For me, this code also doesn't make it clear if `array` is sorted in place or if it returns a new list, leaving the old list untouched, although part of that is not the function nesting but rather the un-Pythonic identity-assignment and returning a mutated list. Writing it like this: def sort(self, array): def counting_sort(exponent): def count_number_of_occurences(exponent): divisor = 10 ** exponent count = [0] * 10 for element in array: digit = (element // divisor) % 10 count[digit] += 1 return count def count_starting_index(): for index in range(1, len(array)): array[index] += array[index - 1] def shift_right(): for pointer in reversed(range(1, len(array))): array[pointer] = array[pointer - 1] array[0] = 0 def build_output(count, exponent): output = [0] * len(array) divisor = 10 ** exponent for element in array: value = (element // divisor) % 10 index = count[value] output[index] = element count[value] += 1 print(output) return output count = count_number_of_occurences(exponent) count_starting_index(count) # FIXME: this function doesn't expect an argument, the original had the same problem. I don't know if the bug is in the definition or the call shift_right(res) return build_output(count, exponent) maximum = max(array) maximum_power = len(str(maximum)) for power in range(maximum_power + 1): array = counting_sort(power) return array ... at least makes it clear that it returns a new list, but destroys the old list in the process. I stand by my original opinion that making data dependencies explicit by not using overusing nested function definitions is a good idea. Too much indentation is a code smell, too.

Neat, some ideas: * Instead of writing `Union[dict, list]` every time, you could use a type alias, assigning something like `Matchable = Union[dict, list]` near the top of your module once and then just using it like `def matches(obj: Matchable, partial: Matchable) -&gt; bool:` * You could add support for tuples and sets rather easily, using your implementations for lists and dicts respectively * You could consider expanding the behaviour for dicts to take the value associated with the key `...` into account. For example, you could have `Partial({...: [...]})` specify that you're looking for a `dict` where each value is a `list`. * If you're looking for a challenge, consider adding support for dataclasses, so that one might do: @dataclass class Point: x: int y: int matches(my_point, Point(x=0, y=...) (Yes, I know that that is abuse of notation, and not all dataclasses will support it, but by default it's perfectly feasible.) * Consider adding documentation. Things that are important to note clearly: - Where `...` is valid exactly, and what it matches (in lists, does it match 0 or more items, 1 or more, or exactly 1; in dicts, does it match exactly 1 key or any number of them, what happens with the value associated to that key, etc.) - What the default behaviour is when there is no `...` - What kind of edge cases there are and what your library does in those cases.
that assumes the right people that were invited accept ;)
I though maybe I should ask here since I didn't get any answer on /r/learnprogramming .
👍
More awesome content from Chris. Funny, last week I was working on a rudimentary Monte Carlo simulation for the game of Trouble (long story, but essentially wanted to see if it was more advantageous to pull out a new piece every time you roll a 6 or advance the piece already on the board).
Why would someone want to switch to 3.7 then if it has functionality for latter versions?
The loop here is a very inefficient way of calculating the values--much better to create data from numpy that's two-dimensional by changing the `size` parameter in the assignment of the `pct_to_target` and `sales_target` variables, for instance: pct_to_target = np.random.normal( avg, std_dev, size=(num_reps, num_simulations) ) You can then work out the commission percentages using [`np.digitize`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.digitize.html) and [`np.take`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.take.html): commission_percentages = np.take( np.array([0.02, 0.03, 0.04]), np.digitize(pct_to_target, bins=[.9, .99, 10]) ) Multiply the commission percentages by the sales target, and sum along the first axis (the sales agents) to get the distribution of total commissions payments: total_commissions = (commission_percentages * sales_target).sum(axis=0) Setting num_simulations to 1,000 I get 51.2ms/loop on my 7 year old laptop, and 6.5s/loop for 100,000 simulations, so roughly two orders of magnitude faster than a Python loop.

All the things you suggested are good places to give your attention. You might also familiarize yourself with some programming patterns that are used often in web development. For example, callbacks, closures, and socket setup code. You may also want to understand some of the commonly used features specific to Python, like unpacking, list comprehension, and args/kwargs
&gt;pexpect.spawn But I think this module is not supported to the windows. I am getting the error **AttributeError**: module 'pexpect' has no attribute 'run' [https://github.com/pexpect/pexpect/issues/321](https://github.com/pexpect/pexpect/issues/321)
Thanks for the pointer! I do see a lot of similarities in the approach. I think the main difference is that in the mentioned approach the metaclass construct is used to have each plugin register itself with the registry, where in my case the registry explicitly looks for the classes of a certain type. One thing I really do like though is the part that the plugin returns a function implementing the plugin-functionality, allowing for an easy check if a plugin implements a hook yes or no.

They're also using multiple accounts to do so, my bot has commented on 'go.mo...' links multiple times and I started to notice and backtrack to make sure my spam filters were working. Just a ton of spam bot accounts
Aw. Very cool. I figured someone would figure out a better way to do this. To be honest, I never would have figured out how to use np.take and np.digitize to do this. Very clever. Thanks for posting this solution.
Interesting point. And judging from sometimes awful level of requirements on job postings, companies often really don't know what that is. 
Thank you! I will take a look into the things you mentioned. It is web development automation after all.
What you say is true, I was to some degree conflating implementation with language spec in my answer. But the parent comment arose out of the question about what lists really are like, and in CPython lists are implemented as essentially vectors of pointers to the list elements. My response was meant to illustrate the fact you can have multiple variables referencing the same object, which also means that moving list elements around doesn't involve moving the memory of (potentially) large objects around, just moving around references to them. For immutable things like strings and integers that distinction doesn't really matter, except in the sense that assigning to those objects doesn't cause memory to be copied.
I think that you're asking for a rules engine, so take a look at (from google):- [https://pypi.org/project/durable\_rules/](https://pypi.org/project/durable_rules/) [https://pyknow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/](https://pyknow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) [https://github.com/venmo/business-rules](https://github.com/venmo/business-rules) &amp;#x200B; If this isn't the case can you please clarify your requirements.
Because it isn't performance critical code and it is easier and faster to write in Python. It is the part of the application that reads configuration files, waits for user input, and things alike. There would be no benefit using Cython here.

Been working through this - I have really enjoyed the projects so far. Also picking up a few new things each project (had never used Pylint before!)

The other 1% always bites your ass in production whether you have `fsync` on or not. I've encountered large, cumbersome, "complete" test suites that missed simple things. Teams should focus on writing good tests that ensure sufficient correctness. They should also focus on getting those tests to run consistently and with as few false positives as is achievable. The diminishing returns of stamping out that 1% make it only situationally suitable to even try. 
Don't know any courses but try YouTube sentdex videos for python. He has one playlist each for Django and flask. Good for intro and diving into examples.

My favorite super-basic intro to Monte Carlo in Python is to approximate pi by throwing random darts. If you have a circular dartboard on a square background, the count of darts that lands within the circle is proportional to the area of the circle. You can use the ratio of the counts inside to the total darts thrown to compute pi [Super fun times](https://i.imgur.com/sOPL05L.png).

How is python third edition it’s my second book after I’m done with my html and css book 
I am 50 pages in now and I think that it gives a deeper understanding of the language. I would recommand this book after you get acquinted with the syntax. The book links to a lot of extra information on the internet, which is very convenient if you want to read further on a specific subject.
Do you read them together or one by one ? Sorry for a stupid question but I just got 2 of these and will start working on them this weekend. 
That looks good to me! A final style thing is that your logs are going to have output from all test cases mixed together, which you can avoid by using `hypothesis.note` to report only on the final test case, or `hypothesis.event` to summarize over all test cases.
The same guy who did the “from zero to hero” course you’re talking about also has a Django and Flask course (each separately). Also has one for data science I think. 
It's great. I'd say it's more an intermediate level book (threads, decorators, abcs, contexts, interfaces and muuuch mkre is covered there) with lots of clean examples.
Do you prefer physical books over online resources?

I am new to python language but I jumped in head 1st I am working on a machine learning project that can master tick tack toe.. it’s my 1st project I have no idea what I’m doing but I’m determined to get it done!!! Any advice? 
The "Effective Python" book is also pretty neat.
It's fantastic but not really for beginners. Maybe my favorite python reference book.
Hi there, from the /r/Python mods. We have removed this post as it is not suited to the /r/Python subreddit proper, however it should be very appropriate for our sister subreddit /r/LearnPython or for the r/Python discord: https://discord.gg/3Abzge7.

The regular community is not a fan of "how do I..." questions, so you will not get the best responses over here.

Thank you. I'm not particularly trying to make vector do things fast as I can always use numpy. I just want to make vector class for learning purpose that has numpy interface to learn how to make something like that with object oriented programming. I thought using array was one thing to consider over using list in order to think about the good design.
Yes, there's a way to run it on Windows: https://pexpect.readthedocs.io/en/stable/overview.html#pexpect-on-windows https://pexpect.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/popen_spawn.html Also, I screwed up in my example. You probably want to use `sendline()` instead of `write()`: from pexpect.popen_spawn import PopenSpawn def issueCmd(xf, cmd, cmd2, cmd3): child = PopenSpawn(xf) child.sendline(cmd) print("{}".format(child.read()) result = child.expect("THIS", timeout=1) if result == 0: child.sendline(cmd2) else: child.sendline(cmd3)
I see now why the projects are IMPRACTICAL 
A mix of both tbh. I have a TeamTreehouse account and enjoy Coursera courses. But something about cracking open a physical book and intensely focusing is nice.

Different strokes for different folks 🤷‍♂️ 
That is a good question. If it can do the whole account I might have to do this.
Sadly, it looks like it won't get them all. Maybe with multiple runs? * Reddit * reddit API currently only indexes \~1k most recent items back (confirmed for comments, not submissions) * Twitter * twitter API currently only indexes \~3200 tweets and favorites back
This looks great. Just what I've been looking for! I encountered a bug after trying to add a task but forgetting to wrap the text in quotes. After that I could not add any tasks until I cleared out the list. Steps to reproduce below. $ eagle -a "this is a test" Your list: 1. this is a test $ eagle -a here is another one ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'i' $ eagle -a "here is another one" ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'i' $ eagle -c Your list has been cleared out. $ eagle -a "here is another one" Your list: 1. here is another one &amp;#x200B;
Got it. I will try that. Is there a way to print the live output. 
Expected your logo to be a (Data Matrix)[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Matrix], mildly disappointed 
Adding Facebook capabilities down the track would be awesome but will be having a look now. Great work OP.
Really great work!

Yes, it doesn't show on screen until the expect call occurs though: import sys child = PopenSpawn(xf) child.logfile = sys.stdout child.sendline(cmd) result = child.expect(["THIS", TIMEOUT, EOF], timeout=100)
Keep in mind that deleting items/comments on Reddit, doesn't actually delete them, and they are immediately recoverable on the other cache/static sites. There is a tool to leave the post in-place, but overwrite and then remove its _content_, redacting it, but deleting the post permits it to remain. Just make sure you cover that use case in your updates.

No, unfortunately it will not work with multiple runs. It's limited by how far back the API's will index, and they don't seem to reindex after deletion. I am looking into a possible workarounds, possibly by using the reddit search function or by headless browsers. I'm not particularly hopeful with either of these methods though.
I'd like to add Facebook and Instagram, for various reasons it will be more difficult then reddit and twitter. I'll probably start with Insta as the next major update.
Yep, I actually edit all comments before deleting them: [https://github.com/Nick-Gottschlich/Social-Amnesia/blob/v1.1.0/services/reddit.py#L18](https://github.com/Nick-Gottschlich/Social-Amnesia/blob/v1.1.0/services/reddit.py#L18) I think the sites that auto cache deleted comments will read them as "Wiped by Social Amnesia". I can't guarantee this if they use more advanced caching techniques.
Oh, cool! Now I'm wishing I had used that to link to "[socialamnesia.com](https://socialamnesia.com)" or something of that like. No unfortunately it's just a simple little logo I whipped up.
Using rst/Sphinx are my favorite set of tools for book writing. I love the ability to include external files so I can integrate code examples. It is pretty easy to paper-publish using Amazon's CreateSpace (or whatever they call it now). I did better selling my book that way, then later when I used a "real" publisher.
This post is gold compared to the usual crap we've been getting!
Aw yeah, I didn't even mention in this blog how nice it is to just include text-file examples directly. How did you solve template/formatting issues? Lots of custom tuning? I'm excited to try out a paperback.

There's nothing stopping you to protect the framework or anything along those lines. You will probably have to post more information. What library (with a github link) and the traceback would be a start. &amp;#x200B; If this is a library you are modifying I would clone it into its own directory, then in the project you are using it in install it using \`pip -e ../cloned\_library\`. This will install it as editable, so changes to the library will be available in your project.
Web services. They are kind of stupid, but if you are going to have a web UI you need to be able to get to the db/whatever on the back end through a web server. Thus Flask.
[Here's the library on Github](https://github.com/areebbeigh/profanityfilter) &amp;#x200B; The program won't compile with the error, but [here's](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/322060570016743425/547245263878750219/unknown.png) the error given &amp;#x200B; I considered cloning it, and probably will end up doing so, but I don't see how that may be causing the issue
Can you share your code, or at least the imports and the relevant section? Preferably something that is in text, not a picture.
Post here when you're done I would very much like to see that 
why aren't people using **XAMPP?**
If you ever need to do more than serve HTML and CSS, then you're going to need a web server that lets you program your own server-side logic. Flask is one such server.

Make sure yall cover your tracks so that angry mob dont catch yo ass 
For your dumb users who are still learning (extremely slowly): Can I just run the DMG or will I need to install Python first and follow the steps for running from a command line?
Think about how you'd implement a user login system with just HTML/CSS.
Try to change the expect call to: result = child.expect([b"XFOIL c&gt;", TIMEOUT, EOF], timeout=100) 
because xampp ist a way for google to parse your site and corner the market on indexing it. but flask is meaned to provide more functionality between a webpage and a data source, like a database. but html vs flask is not a rational conversation. flask is meant to be used as a mediary between data and a website.
I personally think it would be nice if it returned one of the modes vs. raising an exception. It looks like [scipy.stats.mode](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.mode.html) returns the smallest number. Maybe a parameter to control returning the smallest or largest of the multiple mode values?
Working on an optimization model in the field of Electrical Engineering. Basically it's an Optimal Power Flow using Pyomo. &amp;#x200B; An Optimal Power Flow is an optimization method to calculate all the Power Systems parameters and keep them inside their range. &amp;#x200B; So, basically it's an optimization problem with linear and non-linear constraints and also inequality constraints.
quite practical and useful. tks a lot.
It's all packaged up so you should be able to run it right from the DMG (or drag it to your applications folder like any other mac application). Let me know if you have any issues!
Sounds like you would be interested in the __file__ attribute or __init__.py file.

Hehe - you won't get any nice plots from this - you get a distribution of the parameter values and number of parameters.
&gt;I love the ability to include external files so I can integrate code examples. Can I introduce you to our lord and savior, Latex?
 There are two parts to this problem. The first part is storing the rules in a hierarchy. The second part is a rules engine. If you want to store hierarchical data, in Python, I recommend the ZODB. ZODB.org. It can also store graphs. &amp;#x200B; As an example, here are two Hierarchical apps I built on top of the ZODB. https://PythonLinks.info https://PythonLinks.info/json-wiki
I wish for same, sans sphinx!
Please consider gender-neutral names for stick figures.
Thanks for your replay, you are right, I test some demo and the exceptions will not break the loop 😅. By the way, what's your project name?
Link to the discussion, please!
You could try pandoc! But what don't you dig about Sphinx?
Technically mode is a set value, isn't it? And it's meant to be representative of the distribution. But in Python's statistics module, it's most-common member. That's not exactly the same, consider `[0, 0, 1, 2, 2.001, 2.002, 2.003, ... , 3, 4]` where statistical mode would be "approx 2", but Python mode will be 0. IMO that's a tough choice, perhaps best solved by introducing a new function and possibly deprecating the existing function. I personally have never used `statistics.mode` but have used equivalent in `numpy`.
Thanks for your replay, I test some demo and this one is interesting: from asyncio import get_event_loop, as_completed, sleep async def func(i): if i == 3: raise Exception() else: await sleep(0.5) print(i) async def main(): for cor in as_completed(list(func(i) for i in range(10))): await cor if __name__ == "__main__": get_event_loop().run_until_complete(main()) If the exception will not break the loop, we will see some output like this: ❯ python test.py 6 1 7 2 8 9 0 4 5 Traceback (most recent call last): File "test.py", line 16, in &lt;module&gt; get_event_loop().run_until_complete(main()) File "/Users/bruce/.pyenv/versions/anaconda3-5.0.1/lib/python3.6/asyncio/base_events.py", line 467, in run_until_complete return future.result() File "test.py", line 12, in main await cor File "/Users/bruce/.pyenv/versions/anaconda3-5.0.1/lib/python3.6/asyncio/tasks.py", line 458, in _wait_for_one return f.result() # May raise f.exception(). File "test.py", line 5, in func raise Exception() Exception But actually I got this: ❯ python test.py Traceback (most recent call last): File "test.py", line 16, in &lt;module&gt; get_event_loop().run_until_complete(main()) File "/Users/bruce/.pyenv/versions/anaconda3-5.0.1/lib/python3.6/asyncio/base_events.py", line 467, in run_until_complete return future.result() File "test.py", line 12, in main await cor File "/Users/bruce/.pyenv/versions/anaconda3-5.0.1/lib/python3.6/asyncio/tasks.py", line 458, in _wait_for_one return f.result() # May raise f.exception(). File "test.py", line 5, in func raise Exception() Exception No other numbers are printed, so I think the exception broke the whole loop. &amp;#x200B; By the way, what's your project name? 
You get means and variances of mixture components, as well as the component probabilities. You can just ignore any components whose probabilities are very low (say, &lt; 0.01). Regarding plotting: I used this at work recently to estimate a density. After fitting the model, I had access to estimates of the parameters listed above. Together with the normal pdf, which you can get from scipy.stats (or just code yourself), it takes maybe a few minutes to cobble everything together in a function and get the pdf of the mixture. From that, plotting was pretty easy.
Seems very nice. &amp;#x200B; I kinda wish that the material was shared / common with coderdojo and code in the community. &amp;#x200B; Too bad the video looks like a promotional video -- always super-positive, unclear who was selected to speak, etc., it's hard to gauge how much it corresponds to reality.
Bayesian nonparametrics might well be the coolest shit ever.
I personally know the teacher and his teaching style and I can definitely agree with what the students are saying.
Does it conform to `black` :-?
In the data science world, you might not even care about websites, and you may just want to wrap a predictive model in a simple API that another program can easily hit with a request containing an input. No HTML. No CSS. No webdev nonsense.
The maximum database size is probably about half the size of your available memory. Half for your application, the other half for the Pickle it generates. But maybe it takes a long time to generate such a large pickle. If your data is larger, then try out the ZODB. It stores persistent objects as pickles, and tracks the references between them. They went up to 100 Gigabytes in Produciton at Zope Corporation. For even larger databases, stored across multiple servers, try out NEO, not to be confused with Neo4J. As of last yers, they go up to 4 terrabytes in production, 8 terabytes in test. The problem with a database, is that you have to map back and forth between the application and the data. Lots of work. So the issue is do you want speed of development or security. Different applications have different priorities. You may find this discussion on Pickle security interesting.

Thank you. Stay tunned because Im planning some really cool features. To the quotes thing: Yeah, that the deal. The task title has to be one param and thus enclosed inside quotes since thats the CLI thing. To the bug: Awesome, thank you. I will fix it asap and let you know.

Thanks for the tip about pandoc, I'll check it out. Sphinx is quite complex, the extra punctuation etc., make it very un-rst-like, that is document source doesn't read like a document any more. It feels like it's just one step away from TeX...
Do you delete immediately after editing the comment? I think in that case bots that index comments still get the original text.

Indeed. Phone autocorrection decided it knows better.

Drayer, it's a python library that lets you publish and mirror streams of digitally signed records, like scuttlebutt. But it lets you delete and edit things by using an datastructure that I don't actually know the name of, so I'm calling it a doubly-ordered list, and everything is stored in a SQLite database, so it's super sneakernet-friendly, and records have a key, value, and type, so it's easy to define higher level stuff on top of it. Also Drake, which is a toy little Twitter clone that lets you make and view posts, and it acts as a web server to serve the files in the streams to normal browsers. Also some code that implements some scavenger hunt puzzles with some WiFi enabled custom props, but I can't say anything about that because that would be a spoiler!

I've been dabbling with VBA and would much prefer to work with Python for Excel automation tasks, so this is great timing and I'll keep watching - cheers!
Wow, that would be great if it did replace bash. Extremely unlikely, but it looks really cool and bash... is bash, and most of the other bash replacements are just a regular shell with improvements(Although big ones).
I vaugely remember something like that, but I'm probably remembering it wrong. What I do know is that Libsodium is a really really common crypto lib that's meant to be really easy to use and hard to get wrong. And it's got elliptic curve crypto, which is just so cool! Public keys are only 32 bytes! And Blake2b has no length extension attacks, unlike Sha2. I've used libnacl/Libsodium extensively on Arduino and Python and haven't has any issues.... That I know of... Not that I'd know... Because crypto is hard and crypto bugs are subtle...
I'd go with CherryPy, but I have one somewhat minor gripe with it. It's the my favorite framework I've found, except the max bytes of the request before it caches it in a disc file is only 1000 bytes last I checked, and you can't change that without editing the code or complicated callback hook stuff. Bad guys could probably use that to wear out cheap SD cards, since almost any dynamic app has to accept requests bigger than that.
Assuming that i'd ever want to do this, because honestly i was not the same person when i created this account and i probably should do this, would this software be enough to do it assuming i leave it running long enough? Do check the age of the account.
Exceptions are great. The alternative is manual error checking of return codes, which is a hassle because you can't propagate things you can't handle, except manually, or no error handling, which is.. just awful. Plus, they have a string in them, which tells you what happened, but also serves as documentation for why the exception is there. There's so much you can do with them! 
Python programmers tend to just code exactly what they want it to do, with hooks for the other stuff people might want it to do. They use a few levels of inheritance, a pure function or two when it makes sense, and they use libraries instead of rewriting code for the seventeenth time. Usually something like a window is an object. It has a function to set the title. It works pretty much like you'd expect it to if you were describing a physical object. "Blog programming" chooses to have about ten layers of extremely abstract concepts with no connection to the actual problem domain, and then somehow still leave out features that are trivial to implement if you're just programming them, not trying to encode them into a huge mathematical theorem. Computer science class is not a checklist where you try to see how many obscure patterns you can code! They're tools! Not achievements you unlock when you pack 15 into one file! Patterns are great, but you don't need to use them just to look smart. 
I'm not sure I quite understand, but it sounds like a pretty standard race condition, and threads probably shouldnt access the same data structures without obvious or documented reasons it's safe to do so.
The mode of categorical or discrete numeric data is the most common value; the mode of continuous data is the value giving the maximum of the PDF. The example you give is of continuous data, and that use-case isn't currently supported.
&gt; Sphinx is quite complex, the extra punctuation etc., make it very un-rst-like rST literally can't be expanded with new syntax, all Sphinx can add are new roles &amp; directives (concepts built into rST) and processing systems. All the "extra punctuation" is necessarily part of rST. Sphinx *can not* be un-rst-like. And the ability to add non-trivial features is the entire value proposition of rST at this point. If you don't want it, just use markdown (pro tip: [sphinx supports markdown documents](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/markdown.html)).
What fun.
Pondering this in the early hours, I realised it's straightforward to calculate the mean directly. The commissions rates are derived from the target percentages, but those are just calculated from your normal distribution. This means you can use the CDF to calculate the splits between the commissions rates directly: from scipy.stats import norm rv = norm(loc=1, scale=0.1) rates = np.array([0.02, 0.03, 0.04]) rates_p = rv.cdf([0.9, 0.99, 99999]) - rv.cdf([-99999, 0.9, 0.99]) Because your rates and targets are independent, the expected value of their product is just the product of their expected values... which is just the sumproduct of the outcomes and their likelihoods, so the mean is: ((targets * targets_p).sum() * (rates * rates_p).sum()) * 500 If you use `rates` and `rates_p` with `np.random.choice` directly, you also get the answer about 40% fast than with `np.take` and `np.digitize` (though I am quite proud that I worked that trick out!).
Do i have to copy and paste in my python to try it out?
for header in soup.find_all('h3'): for para in header find_all('p'): print(para.get_text())
Yeah you will, make sure you copy both files, other wise it won’t work.
You need Scrapy. Beautiful soup is too raw. Scrapy is built on top of Beautiful soup.
You could allow users to upload their Twitter archive, that way you have access to all tweets
Lets hope this doesn't break the order
There’s always regex- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1732348/regex-match-open-tags-except-xhtml-self-contained-tags /humor
I take instructions kind of literally. It was never indicated whether the order was necessary. I'm not familiar with the find_all's mechanics, but if it's a general recursion, the order should be held.
Don't know if you are looking for comments or not but just it might help. If you move just the data into the letters file you make the code a little easier to follow. from letters import DATA class OUTPUT: def __init__(self): self.lines = [""] * 6 def __str__(self): return "\n".join(self.lines) def add_string(self, string): for c in string: self.add_letter(c) def add_letter(self, let): for i, line in enumerate(DATA.get(ord(let), [""] * 6)): if i &gt; 5: break self.lines[i] += line if __name__ == "__main__": chars = OUTPUT() chars.add_string(input("put ya words in")) print(chars) In the letters file. DATA = { 32: [ r" ", r" ", r" ", r" ", r" ", r" "], 65: [ r" r", r" /\ ", r" / \ ", r" / /\ \ ", r" / ____ \ ", r" |_/ \_|"], ...
Oh hey they made Faceblock a real thing
Sorry to say mate, i didn't get the desired output. Can you please read my post again I've updated the post regarding the output Thanks
 for header in soup.find_all('h3'): print(header.get_text()) for para in header find_all('p'): print(para.get_text()) I'm assuming the output of what I had earlier was along the liens of: para 1. mmx para again mmx mmx mmx Correct? 
Please read the sidebar. Rule 1 says that things that belong into [/r/learnpython](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython) should go there
No man, I've tried it either ways also. Its printing all h3 tag by your code or if i loop to find_all('p') under the loop of find_all('h3') its printing each h3 with all possible &lt;p&gt;'s out there
Ohh shit, i guess i should delete this
eh, not a problem, people are nice here. just something to think of for next time :D

It's hard to take the article seriously when the first (slow) example calculates `max` each iteration. It can be made hundreds or thousands of times faster with a simple variable assignment.
Thanks!
Oh, yeah, the get_text() might be a bit too much here, I see. So, maybe something like this. This will iterate over every object for child in soup.descendants: print(child.string)
Thanks, tbh that just redirects to [https://github.com/Nick-Gottschlich/Social-Amnesia](https://github.com/Nick-Gottschlich/Social-Amnesia) for now, but I should probably still get https set up properly. And eventually make a real website.
Ok, let me know if it you still can't get it to work and I can investigate.
Interesting, I wonder if that's because the reddit API still stores the original text right after editing? Perhaps I'll have to add some sort of delay. I'll look into this.
If you have less than 1000 comments/posts, it will remove all of them. Otherwise no.
I like this idea, I'll look into it. I wonder if something like this works for reddit too.
Wow. Good insight. This is a very elegant solution. Thanks for pondering on it and posting it!
Problem fixed

/. vs dask vs celery vs mp ?
We have a lot of utility scripts for downloading and moving data across our internal network, so I'm looking at refactoring, updating the docs, and implementing with docker 
Interesting. Perhaps there are some unseen whitespace characters... It is weird that you're getting a TIMEOUT but there's no output. Let's try a regex as a pattern: https://pexpect.readthedocs.io/en/stable/overview.html#beware-of-and-at-the-end-of-patterns result = child.expect(["XFOIL\s*c&gt;", TIMEOUT, EOF], timeout=100) Which would change the function to the following: def issueCmd(xf, cmd, cmd2, cmd3): child = PopenSpawn(xf) child.logfile = open("xf.log", "wb") child.sendline(cmd) # timeout is in seconds, default for PopenSpawn class is 30 result = child.expect(["XFOIL\s*c&gt;", TIMEOUT, EOF], timeout=100) print(f"{child.before}") # This is all the output before the "match" print(f"The result is {result}") # The result is the index of the matched "pattern" # result of 0 means "THIS" was matched (since it's index 0 in the expect() call) # TIMEOUT (index 1) means no match, EOF (index 2) means spawned process is done if result == 0: child.sendline(cmd2) elif result == 1: child.sendline(cmd3) else: # EOF means the other end is dead child.close() Let me know how that goes! 
&gt; because xampp ist a way for google to parse your site and corner the market on indexing it. You're talking about amp. XAMPP is Apache, MariaDB, PHP, Perl.
I'm looking into solutions for this, it might be possible using reddit's search functionality but I can't make any guarantees
I have no experience with celery, but I can speak more to ezpq; it does not aim to compete with large distributed frameworks (or any other libraries for that matter). &amp;#x200B; \* sole developer (me) learning and having fun with python. \* ezpq is a personal project of mine, written with my needs in mind, for community consumption. \* ezpq is not distributed. \* ezpq is in pure Python; no 3rd party, external dependencies, or message brokers. \* ezpq wraps around \`mp\` (or threading); it doesn't replace it. &amp;#x200B; ezpq is not as feature-rich as other offerings; simplicity is its best feature, IMO. ezpq attempts to make it as easy as possible (with as little as possible) to parallelize your existing Python code. &amp;#x200B;
Is there a way to handle multi-arg functions like [multiprocessing.starmap](https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html#multiprocessing.pool.Pool.starmap)? 
`data.columns = ('x', 'y')`
Step one, read the documentation. It will be more useful for basic stuff than 100 opinions. You can name the columns when you create the dataframe. Or you could create two series. Or you can rename the columns once they're imported.

Python is everywhere. I think Google uses it. It's great for projects or programs that perform tasks. Because of all the libraries, it can be used for almost anything. It's also really easy to learn.

See: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#comparing-sequences-and-other-types TLDR: It stops comparing after it has compared the first element in each list and sees they're not equal. Think of it like comparing a String which is just a list of characters ... kind of... It just goes left to right and will determine the result on the first difference.
I've heard that the /r/DataHoarder folks have developed methods to make full backups of even decade-old accounts, so there must be a trick to it
He's using PuLP, a python library which acts as a front-end to multiple solver backends. The default solver is CBC (https://projects.coin-or.org/Cbc) which is a mixed integer programming solver. If you notice, he declares one of the variables (playerstatus) as "Binary". Pulp will automatically convert this problem to an integer programming problem and run the solver with those settings. In other words, he's not solving a linear problem.
[https://docs.python.org/3.3/tutorial/datastructures.html](https://docs.python.org/3.3/tutorial/datastructures.html) &amp;#x200B; ## 5.8. Comparing Sequences and Other Types Sequence objects may be compared to other objects with the same sequence type. The comparison uses *lexicographical* ordering: first the first two items are compared, and if they differ this determines the outcome of the comparison; if they are equal, the next two items are compared, and so on, until either sequence is exhausted. If two items to be compared are themselves sequences of the same type, the lexicographical comparison is carried out recursively. If all items of two sequences compare equal, the sequences are considered equal. If one sequence is an initial sub-sequence of the other, the shorter sequence is the smaller (lesser) one. Lexicographical ordering for strings uses the Unicode codepoint number to order individual characters. Some examples of comparisons between sequences of the same type:
I feel like you should get this code reviewed by someone knowledgeable in python - has lots of rookie mistakes
Why do you use Medium?
&gt; But realistically what are the machines/program that run using python? Computers. &gt; What are the craziest things running python? Define crazy. &gt; Should I look into another language? Yeah? Why not?
If your computer can do it, Python can make your computer do it. You may have to be clever for some of those things, but mostly not too clever. If you've used matlab, you might check out numpy. Also, subscribe to r/learnpython.
Thank you. Exactly what I was looking for 
elementwise comparison
&gt; Should I look into another language? Python is an all-purpose language, if you get good with it there is very little you will not be able to achieve. But it's always good to keep an eye open and experiment with other languages, especially those that introduce new concept or way of thinking. Like if you use Python as Oriented Object, you could try Haskell, OCaml, or F# for the functionnal programming aspect of those (and the strong types), Common Lisp, Scheme, Clojure or Racket to experience the Lisp experience, Prolog or Datalog for logic programming, R or Julia for Data Science done another way than Python, Brainfuck, Piet or Malbolge for esoteric programming, (and there are many many other alternatives, I only cited a few contender) I like Python but doing a few side projects with Haskell, Common Lisp, Prolog and Clojure I believe made me change the way I do Python (in a good way). So my advice would be to start programming with Python, and in a few months/years when you'll be good with Python, go out of your confort zone and try another take at the programming experience from a different point of view

I do NOT want to sound rude, but honestly you could have held onto your comment haha..
The `map` function does not unpack nested iterables like `starmap`, but that is a great (and simple) feature idea; thanks for that! Until then, you can use the longer form to perform the task at hand: ```python import ezpq import random def sum_args(*args): return sum(args) # list of random 3-tuples arg_list = [(random.randint(0, 9) for j in range(3)) for i in range(10)] with ezpq.Queue() as Q: for args in arg_list: Q.put(function=sum_args, args=args) Q.wait() output = Q.collect() print( [(x['function'], x['args'], '=', x['output']) for x in output] ) ``` Output: ``` [('sum_args', [9, 8, 5], '=', 22), ('sum_args', [3, 0, 2], '=', 5), ('sum_args', [7, 9, 2], '=', 18), ... ``` Hope this helps; thanks for the feedback.
Weirdly combative.
What are the other programs you mentioned used for ? I have a hard time finding what I want to do with programming but I really want to learn it. I'm thinking home automation and some engineering calculations for prototyping and stuff like that..
That is what I usually start with but the pandas documentation isn’t very clear imo and I haven’t been successful with using the .read_csv commands. 
I use it in the chemistry lab to run pipette robots. Also you can control industrial robotics platforms with it.
Oh I'm not talking about displaying code listings in Latex. I'm talking about writing Latex macros to accomplish something akin to templates. This makes writing books and large documents more "data-driven", which is what I prefer when organizing my documents. For example, when I wrote my Master's thesis using Latex, I spent a lot of time learning Latex language and packages so I could accomplish simple things like data driven graphs. Sphinx makes this easy because it uses Jinja as its templating engine for rendering RST into other formats. And because Jinja is essentially a thin wrapper around python, you get access to pretty much all the python ecosystem to write your documents. (See this article as an example of what I'm talking about: https://www.ericholscher.com/blog/2016/jul/25/integrating-jinja-rst-sphinx/)
I feel the same about your post :) I think your post was very low effort, and most of your questions could have been googled. It didn't add anything to the subreddit, and mostly just came off as "what is python?", in long form. No offense meant to you.
Could I run programs that run programs on my computer? For instance, data mining, test analysis, etc?
I'm not sure what "wrapping everything in a function and trying to run it as process" means here. You created a function that takes the object as an argument? Or you made the class method call a function and passed data to it? If not the latter, try that. Also, I'd try the simplest possible example of `multiprocessing` on this Windows env to see if it works and you are using it right.
I'm making an apartment listing sorter that takes our inventory of available apartments and lets me select options , then sorts them based on how well the apartments match. Then, it builds premade phrases to add to an email to make emailing prospective buyers with matches easier. It uses pyqt 5. 
With the optimized tree stuff mostly done, I can start parsing through stack overflow to create a local search engine. Right now I'm just planning to divide and conquer until I can process blocks of posts with the memory on my computer. Then I'll start creating a search engine over a small subsection of the SO database and start testing it to see if I can get reasonable search results. 
If you just want to run them and wait for output, check out `subprocess`. If they are terminal based programs with user interaction, check out `pexpect`. If it's a GUI program it can be done, but I don't know the library off the top of my head.
Damn this is awesome thanks for sharing
These things you linked are librairies?
OCaml is used a lot in the financial world in London and hongKong from what I remember because it compiles to very efficient C and with strong types comes great debugging power, Haskell is first a research language but it is also used in the industry: https://wiki.haskell.org/Haskell_in_industry (with approximatively the same strength as Ocaml I believe) Common Lisp is a very old language, but known example of use are A.I. and is also used for server at Grammarly and a few others: https://lisp-lang.org/ Clojure is in a lot of well known company like Netflix, Amazon, Wallmart etc https://clojure.org/community/success_stories Scheme and Racket are mostly for learning and research I believe? Prolog is embedded as a query language in other projects, I don't have any example right now. Datalog is similar, one use I've seen recently is Datomic(https://www.datomic.com/), a database system that use datalog as the query language. R and Julia as I said mostly machine learning and data science. Brainfuck, Piet or Malbolge, it's not for industry at all! Go take a look at them, they are language designed to make it hard to program with them ;) They are designed as a joke but it can be a good brain teaser to design program with those. But definitely not to work seriously with them 
Well, I dont like to suggest python as a first language because its dynamically typed. This means that data types aren't static. A variable called name can be set to any data type. Conversely in say C# a variable is declared by stating a type like so: string name = "joe"; . The same goes for methods within classes. However, python was my first programming languages and there are work arounds to this problem. For instance in my current project I have a folder call Helpers which has a file called TypeHelper.py (pep8 can bite me). In that file there us a class called typeHelper with a method called checkIsInt which takes an argument and returns true or false. I then use those functions to parse data. You can also cast variables as types by using the int(), str(), etc methods. Python can do pretty much anything. As a mechanical engineer, I would look at raspberry pi and how python can communicate with it. It could be cool to build something that communicate to mechanical components, which you can do with python. 
Stuff that uses python: Instagram is built with Python, as is Reddit iirc. In footage from NASA you can occassionally see Python code on their screens. It's used alot in devops stuff; I've built a barcode scanner for Windows tablets for a fairly big industry firm with it and my finals project involved an inventory system built with Python. You can program microcontrollers with it (don't do it (my opinion)); it's used alot in biochem. It's great for testing algorithms or prototypes (I've recently done FFT with Python to have something to work from when implementing it in Rust afterwards) And lastly there's a 35C3 talk called "writing drivers in high level languages" or something like that where a research Team of the TU München wrote - among other things - a Network Driver in Python You can do a shit ton of stuff and Python is just so much fun and so easy to work with. I really like rust too, but with Python you're taking approx 1/10th the time to do the same thing (for execution speed the inverse is true though) If you want some programming projects, Project Euler is great fun imo
I like to write articles on my projects so they get wide audience, can easily reference my work and results to recruiters, and generate ideas and conversation. Correct, me If am wrong, but I assume you're asking why I don't use Github? I do use Github (although this project is not published on it), but Github isn't really designed with the same intention as Medium.
For home automation, that sound like IOT and embedded programming to me, Python with Arduino is fine I think? But maybe you'll have to look at C/C++ eventually or another language that run easily on embedded system. For prototyping, Python and Common Lisp/Clojure shines 
Oh and also: ewwww, a mechanical engineer :D
That's not a bad subreddit to talk to, although I doubt they will be too happy with my project
commenting so i can go through this later
This is just brilliant. A very worthy share
I am starting work on a python web application to perform mathematical analyses of wargaming units. &amp;#x200B; The application will need to pull data from a database (and I'll probably also have to make that database!) and simulate combat, give a decent 2-D representation of that combat and finally report statistical averages. Eventually we will want to map out parameter spaces. &amp;#x200B; It needs to be a web app because the relevant users require something convenient and quick to use. I expect a spectrum of users - some will want to do something simple ("does an orc beat a human on average") and some will want to do very complicated things. &amp;#x200B; I have more experience with the data analysis side of python (the pandas, numpy etc stack) than with object oriented design, which I think will be a challenge because bad decisions now could cause a big headache later on. I expect over time to have other people contributing to the project and adding more complexity to the simulations. &amp;#x200B; I'd appreciate any advice about how to get started - what do I need to read, what frameworks should I use, etc. 
Oh gotcha. I misunderstood.
Yes. `subprocess` is a standard library (i.e. "baked in" to Python). `pexpect` is a separate install, but not at all painful. For my own reasons, I'm installing it the hardest possible way and it's literally 3 commands. If this is something you want to mess with, check out [Automate the Boring Stuff](https://smile.amazon.com/Automate-Boring-Stuff-Python-Programming/dp/1593275994).
They should consider checking there server. Very unstable.
Shamless plug: I wrote a wrapper around multiprocessing to make a lot of things easier called [parmapper](https://github.com/Jwink3101/parmapper) that can do multiple args, and kwargs. Both in the iterator and for all function calls.
You need to disable firewall and have the both devices in the same network. So you will be able to connect from other devices.

This looks pretty cool. I wrote a similar-though-less-featurful tool call [parmapper](https://github.com/Jwink3101/parmapper) to make a lot of this kind of thing easier. I am going to look through yours for inspiration on improving mine.
&gt;Threading is pretty useless in this case because of the GIL (global interpreter lock), which means that only one thread will run at a time. Unless (effectively) your computation's I/O bound! Back on topic: is your class method _actually_ a class method, and decorated with `@classmethod`? If this is the case, `mutliprocessing` breaks because `pickle`, the serialization mechanism it uses, doesn't into decorators. As an alternative, try `pathos.multiprocessing`, a third-party API-compatible library which uses `dill` for serialization. It's great for any decorated method _as long as_ the decorator isn't stateful (like `functools.lru_cache`).
Thanks for the reply. Both devices in the same network implies the same WiFi etc? 
This week I’m searching for more How To Learn Python books while not actually getting any coding done. :)
Ah, sorry, its not _actually_ a class method, just a method :] Fixed it in the post.
Had a mistake in the post, its not a class method it's an instance method :] 
Nice!
They have utterly different domains of applicability and to do a direct comparison is pointless. Therefore I'm too annoyed by the intro to read the article.
This is excellent. Thank you.
You need to go into more detail about `all approaches failed`, then. It's barely clear what you're actually trying to do, let alone how things are blowing up.
Thanks!
That's how I read it, then I unthinkingly typed the same thing meaning what you meant, not what you wrote.
Thanks a lot. These are really good ideas.
Thank you for this post. One of the most difficult things for me, trying to learn python, is knowing which questions to ask / how to formulate them so I can get the answers I need. For the past 2 days I've been struggling to configure a logger for my project and I found in your article some awesome tips and some explanations that I hadn't encountered in other sources. So thanks again !
As long as they make a back up of anything beforehand they'll probably be happy :)
Yeah, I know, I'll provide thorough examples once I've found some time.

Yes. Devices need to be connected in the same network. Doesn't matter if is vía eth or WiFi. Check the internal IP of the PC, disable the firewall and then try to connect to http://internal-pc-ip:port from the phone. Sry for my rusty English. As I said in the other comment (I just removed it), is a network problem, not a python one.
Commenting to remember this fact later
All you need to do is start writing and working through the issues. Pick a project, run with it, slap what you learn along the way on to your resume. 
I managed to fix it, thanks!
I just finished your book. I think it was great, especially considering the price (admittedly, I didn't pay for it). It actually introduced me to the concept of Clean Architecture (as defined by Robert C. Martin, which you could perhaps point out a bit obviously... or did you already?) and some cool concepts. I don't really buy in the hard-core test-first mindset, and I think that the implementation of Clean Architecture overcomplicated some things a bit (instantiating a class just to call \`.execute()\` on it seems un-pythonic to me), but I still think it was worth the read. You could certainly write books published on even more professional channels with some work and some editorial help! Also a friendly note: in a couple of code examples (in chapter 3+ I think) you have this no-op: \`mock\_use\_case().execute.assert\_called\` It lacks the parentheses so it doesn't actually test anything. Just letting you know :) .

Python can handle almost anything, from hacky scripts to file IO to back-end stuff to data analysis to deep learning at scale. Some applications will be faster in e.g. C++, but Numpy and similar libraries will help where they can, and Python's expressiceness and ease of use mean you'll spend far less time writing code than you would in other languages.
No idea what you're talking about there. I haven't reached so far into Hypothesis' documentation.
I just want to learn python
Not hard, do the sololearn course, its free and taught me, then i bought a few courses on udemy to further my knowledge.
я тоже удивлен что русскоговорящие здесь) 
L = \[\] for x in binary: L.append(x) &amp;#x200B;
I'm actually learning it right now. I'm using Python Crash Course: https://nostarch.com/pythoncrashcourse It's really good. And I have no programming experience at all. 
Very nice write up, seems a bit insane for a 'job screening assignment' though. Hopefully it was payed!
I'm new to programming too, and I think the weekly sticky thread [What's everyone working on this week?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/ain66b/whats_everyone_working_on_this_week/) is always a fascinating read, great for inspiration or just seeing what you can do with Python. 
Looks great... Umm wait I don’t see anything.

Migrating a website that is currently using mysql and php to a python framework. The site graphs millions of records of weather and water quality data and is no longer very responsive. I was going to use Flask but am wondering if I could use Dash as the site is mostly charts/ data analysis. If anyone has used Dash for a lot of data I would love feedback on how well it handles it.
The people over at r/learnpython would be the best place to get the help you desire.
Made a flask app that collects data from my ad blocker and opens the data in a port. Prometheus uses the port to scrape the data every 15 seconds. I use grafana to visualize the data in a nice dashboard.
Or `list(binary)`
I am working with this [nextbus](https://github.com/apparentlymart/python-nextbus) python library to implement a script that will print out the next bus arrival times for the buses that run around my school campus. Going to implement the bus predictions in a standalone dashboard that will give me weather and calendar entries and such.
Woops! Added the link. Here it is for convienence: https://github.com/lungdart/packeteer
You're not really likely to get good help here. Please try r/learnpython, the [Python discord](https://discord.gg/3Abzge7), or the #python IRC channel on FreeNode.
Automate the Boring stuff is a great intro book with practical small projects, I'd recommend checking it out!
Neat, but impractical. It seems kind of ridiculious to claim it could save a kid with how impractical it is. This is just a company advertising something that could be done with their service. To be actually useful this would need to be a custom device. Presumably at some point AWS or someone else will come out with an IOT button that has built in cellular. Until that point anything like this is not practical.
What region/campus are you in? I recently did a large project with formatting NextBus data in a mobile app then released for my campus

I am in Iowa! We use the cyride service. We actually have an app that our university made that interfaces with the API, but I wanted my own so I can create a dashboard at home that I can simply look at without pulling up the app on my phone. 
Yeah but depending if the app forces students to pay for it, or if the app was outdated like ours was at UMD, you can make something for yourself like a dashboard and release it to the public because why not, and it might get decent adoption!

Any ting you want, baby.
There are literally 2 comments just above giving him help though, but yes those two subreddits are more relevant for this type of post.
RemindMe! 4 days "play with this"
Why not use Flask or Django? They seem a lot more intuitive
I get a no module named commands error? any way to install that pip doesnt work
&gt; the advice there is often poor or downright wrong. Care to elaborate?
neither of those do anything for the graph production. did you even look at the code? there's one endpoint. 
[I believe dash he uses is built on top of Flask.](https://plot.ly/products/dash/)
if it was a web app, you could use pyramid traversal and it's \`\_\_acl\_\_\` stuff. 
yeah, I can't imagine an upside for anyone not recommending learnpython. it can't be money, must be revenge. 
Making my first Telegram bot using [python-telegram-bot](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot). After just two hours of hard work, it can tell me bad jokes and send me random photos at my command.
For that we first need a multi purpose problem solver AI since coding is more about finding the best performing solutions aka algorithm. If you want to feed it the algorithm and produce the code for you, I believe it can be done by teaching it how the syntax is and how control parameters, variables etc works. If open AI is beating pro players I see no reason for this not to be done.

I would definitely stick to using python for a server build. You can find many tutorials or GitHub repos of other game servers for learning and references.
Ah the graph is pretty neat, and so is the library if you want to keep everything within one file and one end point
