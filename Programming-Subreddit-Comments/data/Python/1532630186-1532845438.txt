well data input, bytes and encoding are a big difference.. especially if you have stuff that reads "strings". Also dict(zip()) died for our sins :( RIP
Seriously? Didn't even know dict(zip()) was a thing, pretty slick... Is there a replacement?
Wops, it didn't die! I was just too lazy to learn the new way http://www.bogotobogo.com/python/python_dictionary_comprehension_with_zip_from_list.php
I can't believe you're getting down voted? Whilst I strongly disagree with your practices, you should be free to do what you please. I don't use black, but I've heard great things about it. I just let pycharm refractor and reformat my code to pep8 standards. 
I have a project with many paths and many nested directories. This project needs to run on a remote server so I store the packages (an off-brand of Jinja2 I use for templating, for example) in a resources dir that all levels of the project 'tree' will have access to. Do you have a better path manipulation style that you recommend?

I could need help with the creation of a Monte carlo simulation if you like 
Absolutely, and it helped me find several bugs before I run the code. I use PyCharm to see the issues though.
Becuse if I've done something pretty where I've alligned function arguments or a dictionary literal: def f(arg1, arg2): d = { 'x': 1, 'y': 2 } And you come along with a different tab width you might see something like this: def f(arg1, arg2): d = { 'x': 1, 'y': 2 } Which is easier to read for you? 
I do not want static typing. I want optional static typing, but code to run dynamically in production.
You should watch the PyCon presentation that I linked at the top. There are some very good arguments why you should use them.
As someone pointed out there's Union, Python also supports generics: https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Generic
 Oh, I wish that were easy to do.
It's still glorious!
Taking multiple types is good design, not black magic.
There's alternative syntax, also the types could make migration to Python 3 less painful. Basically it can help finding and resolving unicode issues, which usually is the hardest part when doing a migration. 
I have feeling Google was doing this on purpose to encourage more people to switch from Python to Go. I think they are absolutely the last ones that are adding python 3 support to their cloud service.
So you basically want Python 3.6 ?
Just wait until 2020 (honestly they should have sicked to 2015 deadline) when 2.7 is officially dropped and things will start breaking up by themselves kind of like it happened with 2.6. A lot of library developers are waiting for it because then they can remove all that Python 2 cruft in their code.
That's like saying unit tests, integration tests also give a false sense of security. All this is really doing is getting you as close to 'sure' as you can be without fully being sure. There is always ambiguity. But regardless of your preference, I would really urge you to see that types objectively make at *least* intent clearer. def some_func(a, b): # 20 or so lines def some_func(a: int, b: int) -&gt; int: # 20 or so lines Just right there, you read the exact same line, the same declaration, but with type hints you now see "oh yeah, the guy who wanted this wanted two ints and will give me an int. Yes there is no hard contract enforced like in Java and sometimes that is very helpful. But it still helps readability. There is not much noise there, rather than looking through 20 lines to see what might be returned, where different things could be returned. I fail to see how that's easier, regardless of your python experience. 
Would be nice with a couple of sentences regarding what this is, why it is useful/relevant and what’s new instead of just a link to a release.
&gt; It gets annoying changing them when in developing when I might change from passing a list to passing just a string for example. Use the least specific/highest on the inheritance tree/most abstract class you can for your argument type hints. For example, you should rarely use `List`. If you need an argument that you can index, [use Sequence instead]. This way, your type hinting will accept strings, lists and more. This makes the functions both easier to use and easier to modify in the future.
Try kotlin.
You're probably being too specific on your argument types. I'm guessing your hint should have been `numbers.Real`.
What do you mean? [PyCharm supports PEP 484 type hints]. The main reason I use type hints is because of how well PyCharm supports it.
Get a native English speaker to help you proofread and fix grammar, I couldn’t read past the first paragraph I’m sorry.
Type annotation helped me to find some subtle bugs, so it is definitively helping. And yes if you write a simple python scripts it's an overkill, but in a larger project it is extremely valuable, even when they are not enforced. BTW: there are actual python modules that do enforce the types, but I personally don't use them. For me type annotations are used as a contract between functions what is allowed input and expected output.
But the very difference here is that an annotation in the interpreter is ignored while tests actually exercise the code, and there's a clear go or no go with the tests actually exercising the logic. An annotation of a specific type won't test that type. A test will.
maybe it's a long con...strictor.........yea, i know...i tried...sorry

Pretty good reading.
Sometimes float. Sometimes None. Optional[float]. Good Lord. I feel Python has lost its way. If you want static typing for performance, you might as well use a modern language like Go. 
&gt; Just wait You realize it's not a matter of choice, right? Also, sorry to disappoint you, but 2.7 will have much longer support than that.
You forgot VSCode
No. 
These days for projects that would benefit from type hints, I use Rust. No half measures.
Does PyCharm do this by default? In running Python 3.5, but I have to use mypy to actually have the checking take place before runtime 
1. I don't think so. Either you update `nginx.conf` so infrequently that manually doing it via ssh is easiest or you do it so often that you need a much more sophisticated and powerful solution. 2. Split up your endpoints into much smaller functions. `pep8` the code.
run mypy vs your code, the results of the type check will differ.
Or TypeScript if you're developing for the frontend
Generally, the programming errors that can be lessened by types are not the type of programming errors that a single programmer will notice in a short amount of time (a year, maybe?). Also, generally, they become more useful the larger the code base. They mostly help other developers working on code you wrote (including yourself when you work on your large code base in a year).
Still stuck supporting python 2.7, so no.
Why does it matter that it’s dynamic in prod?
So... you can over think developing stuff pretty easy because there are so many ways to get the same outcome. Not to mention if you don't know basic development skills you can end up in coding hell. My advice is if you have a problem and know what the outcome is based on a set of rules then you should script it. As your predictable problems go so does your script. Eventually all those problems creates a program. Start small, use common sense, read directions, and read this https://nostarch.com/laurenipsum Good Luck. 
Lots of 3D software -- modeling, animation, compositing, etc -- only supports 2.7
You might benefit from going through the basics of computer science. I recommend watching [Crash Course Computer Science](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8dPuuaLjXtNlUrzyH5r6jN9ulIgZBpdo) for a ground-up understanding of how computers work, including hardware and software and a variety of technologies. 
I wish its number had been [410](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/410) instead.
I recommend watching [Beyond PEP-8](https://youtu.be/wf-BqAjZb8M), a talk given by Raymond Hettinger which goes over a lot of examples of code and how to rewrite them to use Python idioms. 
I disagree, abstraction is a fairly fundamental principle to computer programming, and having to exercise the code to know what it does kinda goes against that idea. Every method/function should have a contract saying what it does (i.e. pre-condition and post-condition), and there’s various ways to create that contract. One of which is static typing - a function expects inputs of certain formats and returns an output of a certain format. The client using that function should not have to look much deeper into it than that - the function’s behavior should be easily ascertained. 
What about: from functools import reduce product = reduce((lambda x, y: x + y), mylist) ? 
Thanks :) Second part of the post is coming next week. This time with more practical examples and tips.
It's just "product placement"/blogspam. The product is posted about every now and then but outside of /r/python I've never heard of them before. Typically there is very low engagement on [posts about Wallaroo](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/search?q=wallaroo&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all) too.
I did some digging and looks like the author started project first as a Python fork, and I'm assuming he met with Guido at DropBox and convinced him to add annotations in Python 3. What supporting this theory is: - he previously worked on language called Alore which also had optional typing - the domain is mypy-lang.org - there's a post on alorelang.org that implies that it supposed to be a Python fork: http://www.alorelang.org/news.html#item0
I haven't seen type hints in many Python books yet, but I am writing [Classic Computer Science Problems in Python](https://www.observationalhazard.com/2018/07/announcing-classic-computer-science.html) exclusively with type hints.
https://python-course.eu
Well in that case you should be able to use things like union types or protocols.

I strongly believe at some point said protocol will come to the conclusion that the human should not be a factor in the decision.
I'm waiting for more widespread adoption of Python 3.6+... probably when Debian 10 is released and ships with 3.6, but in the meantime I can't control Python versions out in the wild for users of my libraries and needing to install custom-managed alt versions of Python on production systems isn't ideal. I'm mainly a library writer so my hands are tied by the community. The comment syntax for type hints isn't appealing to me.
You apparently never worked on any large project.
That's why optional typing can be a great compromise, you use it where you need it.
It also makes refactoring much easier and if you use it properly can help finding bugs.

I think it does but there are certainly settings where this can be toggled
Latest PyCharms do it by default, but only static checking, not runtime. 
If you're feeling adventurous, I recently wrote this precisely so I could start using type hints/mypy and still have my library work on python2.7 https://pypi.org/project/three2six/ As I say, I only recently wrote it and am still in the process of testing on real projects, so I welcome your feedback and/or contributions.
Perhaps you could give this a try: https://pypi.org/project/three2six/ It's an early project though, so please only look at it if you have time to report issues/contribute fixes.
Absolutely! Been using them with PyCharm since Python 3.5!
Why's that? (genuinely curious.) I find as I get older, I wish for the statically-typed languages that do statically typing in an intelligent manner (duck typing, anonymous types, etc.)
Yes. `from typing import Union, List` `myvar: Union[str, List]`
For those not clicking the link, this is an april fools from a little under a decade ago. Guido, while under "permanent vacation", is not "retired" officially, and just letting the core devs govern themselves (and furthermore, still "dictating" guidance, in not allowing any PEPs to be accepted until such a governing body forms).
&gt; any time we touch a new piece of code, we add type hints. My team as well. It's great discipline. We've virtually eliminated run-time type errors.
I haven't ever to my remembrance (after becoming competent with python, at least) experienced a bug caused by my passing the wrong type around. Maybe I just haven't worked on a codebase large enough, but my projects have gotten reasonably big and my only memorable/persistent errors are logic-related (and thus not something static typing would fix or even affect). Like, if I'm writing in a language to which static typing is intrinsic and not optional I'll use it happily, but halfheartedly slapping it onto a dynamically-typed language doesn't feel productive to me in the slightest. IMO, typehints in their current state are useful only for IDE autocompletion (which isn't even necessary, so going all-in with the `typing` module's verbosity doesn't feel too useful) and for non-typechecking-related functionality such as type conversion and dependency injection. I see somebody's already linked an example of the latter, so keeping in line I suppose I'll also [link my own project](https://github.com/eltrhn/ergo) as an example (one of many examples) for the former. In fact, the "non-typechecking-related" use cases like those two can be so handy that the "Postponed Evaluation of Annotations" PEP especially frustrates me, because it seems people have found much more value in typehints than just what can be done with mypy &amp; co. -- and effectively cutting all of that out by making it much harder (especially when the original stance was basically "you can do whatever you want with these") feels like an ugly move.
[You need to install Python for Windows extensions.](https://github.com/mhammond/pywin32/releases). 
Worked on a C# app for a bit and one of the most common prod errors were POCO type mismatches wiring from SQL to code. 
*cough* Zig *cough*
The easiest way is I would write a shell script that sets PYTHONPATH and then starts python. On linux it'd just be: #!/bin/bash if [[ -z $PYTHONPATH ]]; then PYTHONPATH="$PWD/dependency"; else PYTHONPATH="${PYTHONPATH}:$PWD/dependency"; fi python my_script.py The "right way" would be to have a setup.py and requirements.txt that installs them all properly, set up a virtualenv, `pip install .` your package, and then run your script's entry in `$virtualenv_dir/bin/my_script.py` as an executable, and it'll use the virtualenv python installaltion and all that. A setup.py can specify multiple packages so it'll end up in the top level namespace just like your library does.
JSON can't have tuples or ints - but Mypy *can* have recursive references! JsonType = typing.Union[None, bool, float, Text, List["JsonType"], Dict[Text, "JsonType"]] And that's the very definition of JSON ;-) 
That sounds like a perfect use case for virtual environments. Alternatively, you could use something like pex to build a Python 'executable'.
I... I... I don't know what this means. 
It's a programming language. Check it out. You sound like you might like it.
Oh, I'm sure I would. Convincing my team to switch away from Python is another thing altogether. Thanks for the suggestion.
thanks for the response, i just installed it and am still getting the error
There is no such thing as a static python type. These are annotations, not types.
Hmmf. Good luck. I'm using Python at work at the moment, and having come from several months of writing Rust, I'm finding it painfully unreliable.
Okay, I wasn’t talking specifically about python, but about types in general. While there’s no static python type, type annotations do a similar thing as static types in the context of my argument. 
For bachelor engineering students, the only difference between 2.7 and 3.7 is the print statement. 
We mostly use \`pytest\` for test discovery, test context managers and execution. The rest relies on \`numpy.testing\` module and its own assertions.

This wasn't meant as criticizing you, I'm also involved in codebase that is 2.7 and trying to convince management that we need to do this. Funny thing is that we just migrated from 2.6 to 2.7, it took a lot of effort because the packaging of choice was custom made RPMs and we just converted everything to wheels. &gt; Also, sorry to disappoint you, but 2.7 will have much longer support than that. The development of 2.7 was stopped in 2015, currently that branch only is receiving security patches. In 2020 the support will officially end. This means that the packages you love and depend on will start using code that no longer works on 2.7. If your code is static and is no longer in development then you will be fine, but if it is an active project it will be harder and harder to work on and things will start to break in different ways. I saw things breaking after python 2.6 was deprecated. With python 3 now there's a lot of ugly code to make libraries work on 2.7, and many library authors will want to remove it to make development easier.
Now I don't know what your definition of support is, but the Python project will not publish any bugfixes for 2.7 after 2020.
RHEL has support way beyond that and relies on python 2.7.
That can't be further from the truth. There are those that have to use more complicated unicode logic, different mathematical logic (because some tests by instructors have a performance aspect as well) and shittier regex capabilities.
Oh, yeah, in that way it will get worse (luckily). At some point it won't make sense to reimplement things that come for free in 3.x. Security patches will continue through other vendors, that's not an issue.
TypeScript's type system/type checking is ridiculously good. Leagues ahead of mypy. I've been developing in Python for over a decade and I've seriously been considering switching to Typescript for hobby server stuff based on: - How good the typing system is - How good the developer experience is - Portability into the browser should I need it I really want Python to catch up.
The goal of type checkers is to do type checking before the code is run. You actually will get more reliable error messages when you run mypy than randomly trying to call function with random inputs. Types are all about enforcing contracts when performing function calls. I wonder what kind of projects you worked in last 20 years that you don't think this is valuable. Static languages use it to determine what registers on the CPU should be used to process values. The type ch
If python was actually a statically typed language, you might have a leg to stand on here. It's not. It's myopic to believe that type annotations actually give you some sort of safety mechanism.

sorry :/
Sometimes I do - if I'm only expecting one type, I think they make code much cleaner. Here's an example from a school project where I use static type hints, and I think it really aids the code: [https://github.com/misingnoglic/jpeg\_compresser/blob/master/jpeg\_compressor.py](https://github.com/misingnoglic/jpeg_compresser/blob/master/jpeg_compressor.py)

So the hardest part will be making the text coherent? 
Thanks for the feedback!
&gt; Worked on a large C# CRUD app That's the mistake. The C line of type systems is extremely underpowered and brings almost no benefit. That wouldn't happen in Rust, for example. It's the other way around, the DB library wouldn't compile if it didn't convert the value into the destination type.
holy fuck this looks awesome

A new 3.7 project I am working on has them. I plan to make it apart of the next projects.
I created a Bot for seaeching and sending job applications using selenium and stackocerflow. I am actually thinking about making this available to anyone or even open source. Do you guys think it's a good idea? I have never worked on open source...
1 could be hard too depending on what you want. first three sentences from a wikipedia article would be easy, but making heads or tails of those sentences would be harder. it would help by defining what text your parsing and what it should like after, specifically.
Had some downtime today, so decided to apply some stuff I learned from [this article](https://medium.com/@ageitgey/natural-language-processing-is-fun-9a0bff37854e) on NLP and brush up on my Python by building a weather slackbot. There's no unit tests or anything, but it was definitely a fun experiment.
Python is a different tool than Rust or C (or Zig). It's a much higher level language. You're definitely abstracted more from the hardware. I happen to like Python, but I like C# more. (Heresy, I know...) Still, I like Python enough that I don't think about C# much these days and just enjoy Python for what it is. And what it is... is pretty good!
I like both for different problems. If I'm doing rapid prototyping? I want dynamic types. Am I releasing a piece of firmware that's gonna run unattended on a piece of hardware in perpetuity and patching it in the future is impossible? You better believe I want static types.
Well the script would have to be resilient enough to parse most properly constructed sentences in a given language. Could you create a table of words and assign them syntax roles? Like "dog" = noun, "run" = verb, ect So that obviously it would be limited to its vocabulary, but it could "read" and output a video on at least a given topic?
"can someone help me understand the steps of web development..." 1) web applications INTERFACES are donee using html (define thee page layout and content), CSS (design) and JavaScript (add features to the page, as incrementing values etc). If you learn these basics, you eventually will stumble into something called Frameworks, like React or Angular, which are basically JavaScript libraries which employ all of the 3 above in one, making web development easier (in all truth, it's harder first, and easier later.) But in any case, html CSS and JavaScript are always necessary. 2) web apps usually require information. For example, a social network requires user data etc. This is kept on the server (large computers if you will). Servers offer more important functions. For example, if you create a web app for converting money from one currency to another, you usually have the logic on the server. That is, the server has the necessary functions to process these concessions. And so on. 1) is usually refered to as Front end, and 2) as back end. Usually, an applications actually requires both. This is known as full stack. If you are really interested in this, you will need to work a lot. And I mean a lot. I started web development about year and a half ago, and at this point I am sending job applications and many people seem interested in me. So it is possible. But it requires time, patient and hard work. Good luck.
Haha yeah I’m happily far from that world, purely python and JavaScript now. That’s a clever approach, would you happen to have any links/resources of other common pain points Rust solves in a novel way? I’ve been wanting to pickup another language to tinker with and that piqued a curiosity. 
Personally, I'm ok this type of a situation as I feel like there really is no such thing as too much documentation. There have been many times in my career where I've gone back through my code and wondered what exactly the point of a particular class or function was (even the small ones). Documentation almost always rectifies that issue. However, if your function is so small that the documentation is larger than the function itself, it might be time to consider refactoring and seeing if it really is appropriate to have that as a function or not. 
Speaking for myself: a large tech company you know a great deal about has a bunch of internal products, and one of those products is on 2.7 because nobody's really maintaining it, but I'm writing a piece of new software which uses that 2.7 library, so *I* have to use 2.7.

&gt; Well the script would have to be resilient enough to parse most properly constructed sentences in a given language. Really, *really* hard. 
Lol, and i thought creating the video would be the hard part... What would i research to find more on that?
God one. Sigh, I guess self deserves an up vote
Natural language processing.
THANK GOD FINALLY Why didn’t they do that before?
Sorry, I meant the creating the video part.
Or Scala. My only gripe with Scala is the compile time. Other than that, I've been really happy with doing Scala development full time for the past year and change.
You can call it something else like "me" and it'll still compile.
if you know what you'll be parsing, or at least what kind of material, i.e. programing or guitar playing, then it would be easier vs any type of text, but still not super easy. also if you want to edit the text like take out useless sentences akin to the tldr bot on reddit that would also be hard but just rendering the whole page as is would be easy. Ether way start by looking in to [nltk](https://www.nltk.org/), its a tool kit to help with processing natural languages, like splitting sentences in to words or removing 'stop words' (common word that don't add the meaning like and, but, as, from). Further thoughts: start with a simple web site like https://eloquentjavascript.net/ and try and get several pages dynamically from python, then parse each page pulling out several key words and that should be a decent chunk of the project. 
As I understand it, what you have is a series of images, and what you want is to create a video which displays each one for an arbitrary amount of time (timing of each image could be different). In that case, it'll probably be easiest just to dump every frame out as a PNG (i.e. make the image the correct size, and then copy it 30 times per second you want it visible) and use `ffmpeg` to merge them into a video. 
One approach which is simple, if not elegant, is to simply move some of the methods into another module (at module-level scope, as ordinary functions). You can then import that file and assign the functions defined in it as attributes of the class, so they become methods of the class.
Jesus. Don't upload photographs of your code.... Take a screenshot with your computer and put it on imgur. Also, stuff like this should be on /r/learnpython. You have that module installed? Are you sure you're using the same installation of python to run this code as the one you installed this module in? Go into python and type: import sys print(sys.path) Is the directory your module is in shown in the list? If not you need to add it to PYTHONPATH environmental module. You should be able to figure out how to do that with google. 
Type annotations is not about reading one function. It's about knowing where else a thing is used, and what contracts it obeys. Say you can trivially see an instance of a `Boz` class passed into your function. Exactly what is that, where is it defined, what methods does it require and where else is it used? With type annotations, determining this becomes much easier. Firstly you can navigate better with the IDE, and secondly you can define an interface for that class.
&gt;I really want Python to catch up You are welcome to contribute :) I think the main reason mypy's type system is not as advanced is the amount of developers working on it. If you look at the Typescript pulse https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/pulse compared to the mypy pulse https://github.com/python/mypy/pulse its pretty clear why the Typescript type system is more advanced.

If possible, please give feedback on the language, and content. As I would be covering more on pyttsx3. And I must improve my content.
We'll make Python into C/Java... we just have to keep trying! /s
I like to make simple mini games. I like to stick to the basic language instead of using modules. It limits what i can do but i like to think of creative ways to make things
Any reason for rust specifically? To me, it seems strange as a replacement for a high level garbage collected language like Python
It's true that Python itself isn't a statically typed language, but what you could do is set up your CI/your test runners to automatically run mypy (or pyre, I suppose) on every single commit. And of course, you'd set up your dev environment to make it easy for your devs to run mypy locally. Then, set up CI/your tests to automatically mark the build as failing if mypy reports any errors. You then set up your tooling so it refuses to merge in any changes to your master branch or whatever, in the same way you'd refuse to merge in any code that fails a unit or integration test. This will end up having essentially the same effect that you're looking for -- you can't add any code to your core codebase unless the typechecker is happy.

It helps but I've found mypy's to be much more powerful, especially with reporting Optionals.
Look at moviepy
Interesting project! I run a lot of nginx websites behind a reverse proxy, so I have a shitload of configs in the R-proxy's sites-enabled and just one or two configs on every VM it points to. I usually customize the sites with a template and search-and-replace to set it up. I'll have to look at your code more closely, but hoooo doggy, that `newConfig()` function: * Long * Branches and loops interspersed * Short on comments * Tons of key lookups I'm sure it works, but it'd be a lot more digestible as 2, 3, or 4 different functions.

`pyttsx3` has some compiled dependencies which aren't present by default on, for example, the latest version and current long-term support version of the most popular linux distribution (ubuntu 18.04). This should be mentioned.
I normally use either Mac's `say` (subprocess.call) or `google_speech` for cross-platform. Amongst the biggest problem I have met is difficulty in choosing the speaker / language to speak, which is not a problem in my decided choice. Also, there used to be a problem in installing `pyttsx3` on Mac. Not sure about now.
Thank you for your feedback, and time, I will update the correct information.
I will cover the choice of speaker/voice in the next blog. Also the problem of installing pyttsx3 on Mac was troubleshooted in the latest versions. The problem was, the author didn't include crucial decoraters needed to have a wrap around TTS libraries. It has been solved, and hopefully it should work fine on Mac now. Thanks for your time, and feedback. I will try to include information relevant to this in current, or subsequent blogs on pyttsx3.
 The modified code below should get you close. I think the easiest way to go about doing this is to use PIL to create a blank image, and then put whatever transformation you have on that using Paint or some other image viewer, which will allow you to create irregular shapes more easily. Then, you can use this image as a template that you'll read in to get the transformation you need -- which you'll use to apply to any other images. Effectively, doing this manual step once allows you to get the list of pixels that will need to be shaded for each image because it identifies each pixel that has been shaded in the template. Also, one additional note, if your images happen to be RGBA, you can change the (255,255,255) to (255,255,255,255), or transform your image's mode to RGB by im.convert("RGB"). You can check this by calling im.mode Depending on what transformation you're doing, it's possible you could call the code I initially posted for different subsets of the transformation (if it's easily possible to break the transformation into a collection of rectanges for instance), but either way, below should hopefully help. # create blank image blank_image = Image.new("RGB", (640, 480), color = (255,255,255)) blank_image.save("template_image.png") ## After running above code, manually ## transform image in another tool # define function that reads in template image # and returns list of pixels that need to be shaded def get_pixels_to_shade(image_file_name): # open image im = Image.open(image_file_name) # load image's pixel data pix = im.load() pixels_to_shade = [] for x in range(im.size[0]): for y in range(im.size[1]): # if the pixel is shaded in any way, # then add to list if pix[x,y] != (255,255,255): pixels_to_shade.append((x,y)) return pixels_to_shade # get the pixels to shade pixels = get_pixels_to_shade("template_image.png", (255,255,255)) # define function to read in image, # and apply shade to the input list of pixels def shade_image(image_file_name, pixels, shade): # open image im = Image.open(image_file_name) # load image's pixel data pix = im.load() for pixel_tuple in pixels: pix[pixel_tuple] = shade return im # shade in the needed list of pixels in the image shade_image("some_image_file.png", pixels, (50,50,50))

I actually have a great recent example from porting python 2 to 3 simplified as: def clamp(self, some_value): if some_value &gt; self.max_value: return self.max_value return some_value Looks simple but it was actually a functional bug. Sometimes some_value would be set to None. In 2.x, None &gt; float is false. In 3.x it raises an exception because of the type mismatch. With type hinting you are aware when the potential for this kind of thing is possible. Sometimes loose types can bite you.
Duh..!
I would have been extra impressed if the charts were made with pyplt.
I think it helps that non-traditional programmers are taking up Python to do, eg, data analysis or devops. It makes the market larger than other segments like desktop apps, mobile apps, games. Plus it’s good for web development. 
Not really a great trend, in terms of performance, scientific computing could stick to C or some smaller superset of it tailored for scientific computing. Of course, if you don't think of performance, python would be as good as Java for usual user apps. Whatever, preferring Python over C for performance oriented places such as embedded systems... 
How is VB above JavaScript 
You have any hard numbers to back up your claim that python loses to C for scientific computing in terms of performance? I doubt that many people still write raw C code for scientific computing. There are plenty of libraries out there - likely more so for python than for C.
Why is visual basic on the rise?
I smell a Lisp comeback! ((((SuperMobileWebFramework))))
I was introduced to python as a way to handle large datasets. Pandas has worked great for me. I have heard Python is easier to learn than other languages. This is part of the gain here for me. Maybe C has a higher ceiling for efficiency, but I am a far way off from touching Python's ceiling for computational power even.

We used SWIG at work a while ago for a fairly complicated API which involved passing C struct pointers between the languages and it worked (with a bit of massaging). It wasnt amazing and we eventually rewrote the library in native python. If you have specific problems I could maybe try to help. How complicated is the c-api you're trying to deal with? using ctypes directly isnt impossible.
Why is SuperMobileWebFramework a jewish conspiracy?

Yeah this example makes the most sense. You can't just do tabs for indention and spaces for alignment and not end up with code like this. 
Says its ranked by search engine popularity. Maybe VB devs have to google a lot.
Yeah that definitely doesn't sound right.
Mostly because .NET as a whole is on the rise. My company uses it for internal applications, although I wish they didn't.

If you need better performance for parts of your code, you can just implement that in C and turn it into a python package. Best of both worlds.
Scientific computing libraries in Python have C/C++ backends.
A lot of obfuscated vb code is used in malicious documents. I Google vb code at least 50x more than python 
Why does this library not make sure all this documentation is accurate, complete, solve my problem exactly, and not change?
I don't see a lot of full fledged enterprise applications written in python. It's a glue language for tying various pieces together. But for the most part it seems like Java is still king in enterprise land.
Vba is really big for hardcore excel users.
I myself google search python and Django related stuff probably about at least 50 times a day 
You accuse then of being a showoff, because if you are in a functional-enough mood to use a HOF you definitely thought of using sum.
I mess with Fortran for fun, and I'm terrified of ever needing to use Visual Basic.
&gt; For me the great benefit is that I can read a function easier Which is why I prefer docstrings over type hinting. I tried using type hinting because it seemed like such a good idea. But just like the parent comment, I found that they just added verbosity without ever experiencing any actual error prevention. Before I write a function I'm writing a docstring. It forces me to explain, as simply as possible, what it's going to do and what it will be accepting and returning. Not the type of data it's returning, but what the data is. I find that if I'm having a hard time writing a concise docstring then there is a problem, and I get to that realization before writing any actual code.
Well the data pipeline structure has been there for years and I didn't have much choice there. As for the visualisation tool, there was a need to monitor productivity across the claims department and I came up with a way to visualise it and it was approved for testing. One feature of the tool graphs handlers against KPI's on a scatter plot, with each point reprenting one handler and labelled with a code that can be traced back to the handler. It's a good method for qualitative analysis of performance of nothing else. Another feature will plot a handler or an entire team's performance over time on a bar chart. It's received good reviews so far and it's constantly being polished.
Well, it is quite similar except for the Django internals part since Flask follows the WSGI way of interaction.
It is complicated and the company i work for don't want to rewrite it, because they don't want to maintain two versions. I am doing my bachelor's thesis in this company. Sadly i don't have much experience with python so i guess it will be a bit hard for me at the start, thats why i tried to ask here for some information, because the most stuff i find in the internet is "old" i guess :)
Why? I've been on the dotnet core bandwagon for a bit now and I like it a lot. Especially since it can run on Linux now.
A lot of old code for database infrastructure was built in the 90s using VB and hasnt been updated. 
&gt;In the past 12 months Americans have searched for Python on Google more often than for Kim Kardashian, a reality-TV star. o.O
Oh, I meant VB specifically, and we're using it on .NET framework with Winforms. I think .NET is great framework and core. C# is my language of choice for almost everything now.
Maybe not forever though: [https://excel.uservoice.com/forums/304921-excel-for-windows-desktop-application/suggestions/10549005-python-as-an-excel-scripting-language](https://excel.uservoice.com/forums/304921-excel-for-windows-desktop-application/suggestions/10549005-python-as-an-excel-scripting-language)
Or maybe searches for pythons, the actual snakes, are more common now.

Isn't it unfair to compare a repo for a single python package to the repo for a whole language?

Data analyist here. I know only python and have 0 desire to learn any other language. The thought of python becoming antiquated within my career and having to learn a new language makes me sad
I work at a company that does application performance monitoring and yes, Java is really popular with big companies. But our Python agent has a huge userbase. And we use Flask quite a bit for our services. You don't see huge companies using it but everyone else does.
Sure. People can't help you if you don't have specific questions though. Or are you more asking how to even start going with swig?
Who said you'll need to learn a new one?
It won't become antiquated anytime soon
I'm aware of what it is. And what it is is a weakly typed language with an incredible capacity to fail at runtime. It's great for scripts and prototyping, but for anything that reaches over a few hundred lines I'd far rather not use it.
or requests_html which in my experience is a bit faster than selenium but yeah tracking the requests made by the page is the fastest
The only reason I use python is all the community support it has. If data analytics a community moves to a new language and popular libraries lose suppprt. I'll be forced to go with them
Because freelancing is such a stable career form

I'm surprised that Lisp took such a steep nosedive this decade after holding on for basically half a century.
It depends on what to consider Python and which area of scientific computing we're talking about. I'm a physicist, a I use both Python and C++, and I feel like they fall into different categories, and I don't think Python can replace C++ at all. I can share my opinion based on my (limited) experience. Of course, it would be insane to use CPython for computing, it's ridiculously slow. There are many ways to improve performance, of course * Numpy and Scipy. If you problem is easily expressed in terms of Numpy and Scipy, you're probably fine with it. However, numpy has some disadvantages. First, for typical differential equations, you need to express your code in vector form instead of nested loops. For complex things, it's more difficult, and it makes code less readable. Second, it inherently creates intermediate objects, which means memory allocations, which makes it slower than C/C++ (there's NumExpr to challenge that, but I just can't stand using `eval`-like things). * Numba. Absolutely awesome, works like magic, but very hard to debug. That's why I use it for small functions only. * Cython. It's a different language, with the need to compile and a different debugging procedure. Looses the appeal of Python, in my opinion, I'd just write C++ instead and use Cython as an interface between C++ and Python. But it should be good for people who don't like C++. The performance of these things is enough for most tasks. However, where Python falls short, in my opinion, is heavy parallelism and large projects. The vast majority of scientists don't need that, and if they are fine with Matlab, they'll probably be fine with Python. However, I and my colleagues do high-performance computing on clusters. In this area, we have programs with thousands of lines of code which run on distributed systems with hundreds of cores. Here, C, C++, and Fortran remain the powerhouses. You need to be able to use OpenMP, MPI, run things on Xeon Phi or GPU, be sure that you use SIMD instructions. The performance bottleneck is often in cache misses, so you need to optimize for that. Of course, there are some ways to do some of these things in Python, and more and more things appear as the time goes by, but it still feels like those tools fight against the nature of the language, against GIL, against its high-level abstractions. I think Python is just a wrong tool for the task, and I have no idea why would anyone use Python in this case. Of course, Python can be used as a high-level API for you low-level compiled code, or for data processing.
That looks awesome but it is for linux only. I forget say but I work on windows, I am testing that device using application which is in .net. I have device (controler) and application(windows) which allow to program a controler. I need to simulate low condition connection to create good testing environment.

I don't see a question here.
Thery add words like "programming language" to the search term. Otherwise I'd bet C would outrank the other languages by orders of magnitude. 
I'm in agreement with you on this. If I had to for work or some other reason I'd be able to pick up another langauge. It would be purely because someone is willing to compensate me for my time. I dabbled in Java, C#, Ruby and others but I never took to them like I did python. There's so many libraries out there and the community is constantly adding more and more to the language. Its going to be relevant for a while. I don't see the point in investing my time in learning another language until its clear that the community is backing a different language.
I've been saying this for a long time... and most of it I get downvoted beyond the threshold :D We haven't discovered yet a, what I call, "theory of big programs". So, whoever tells you to study CS to figure out how to go from empty editor to a complete program is lying to your face. Computer science doesn't know yet how to do it. That's not to say that countless books and researches haven't been published, we are still no closer to solving this problem than when we started. Computer science can tell you how to sort an array efficiently, or how to exchange messages in a distributed system with unreliable connection, but... it doesn't know how to write programs, no metrics of assessing their quality, no overarching theory. While I'm sure such theory can be found / produced, the best you get to work with so far is an intuition / experts' opinion / statistical research. Often the attempts to formalize this subject fall under the category of "software architecture". So, I'd start there. Just grab any book that has "software architecture" in its title and read it. Perhaps, the most popular book in this field is Fowler's Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture. It's probably not the best one out there, but, like I said, there isn't any objective metric... However, this book will expose you to some existing and theorized to exist practices of writing complete programs, and, perhaps, mention a few things that were tried, but were found not to be so great.
The thing is using this technique the graph takes too much time to load. Is there any other way where I can directly display the output into a webpage
I wish Ruby was becoming the most popular as it is a pleasure to use and a great way to learn OO.
I use type hints mainly if I want my variable's names to be shorter: Ex: def insert\_new(name, check\_in: datetime, check\_out: datetime, room: int, prices: str, notes, in\_res: Reservation = None): In this case, i don't have to name "date\_check\_in", or "date\_check\_out", because date can be a string instead of a datetime object: "2018-01-23". If prices was a float, i wouldn't use type hint. But there, it is a string, so to not be confuse: prices: str. Name and notes are clearly a string, so i didn't use type hints for them.
Probably a sign about the job market. "Coding" is more and more being touted as a way to get rich quick. I can't count the number of posts I've seen here and in r/engineering or r/personalfinance about trying to do this.
Maybe it merged VBA and VB?
No. Like I've written several times, the whole ML-style typing for Python is misguided. An attempt to copy TypeScript or earlier attempts at introducing type annotations into JavaScript (like ES4). I don't think that the type hints proposed capture the type system of Python correctly. I don't think that even the part that they do get right is a very meaningful one: mostly they capture the simple cases, which wouldn't present any problems to programmers anyways. The effort put into supporting type annotations isn't worth the benefits, in fact, it may make the code quality worse. This is because once programmers embrace this feature they may be tempted to write code in such a way that it typechecks rather than writing it for efficiency, ease of use or clarity.
&gt;learn python 2.7 y tho 
Could be that people don't include "javascript" in their search queries. If you have a problem with JS project, you usually google with "node" or "react" or so.
I hope so. Lisp is great.
I agree. Ruby is a wonderful language. I think it’s a shame that the libraries around it are just no way near on par with Python.
I'm pretty sure thats wrong. Last I read neither CPython nor PyPy were using type hints for any performance optimisations. Its a purely development aspect of the language. I suspect if anybody does, it will be PyPy but I don't know how much is to be gained since they use a tracing JIT compiler and I think it will make type optimizations regardless when run long enough.
I thought it was just me
Yes. Hell yes. I don't use them with every damn function and method and class, but for the vast majority I do. I suspect I will eventually do it for everything. Its especially nice since it reduces my documentation workload a lot and makes using the code very nice for others or myself a few weeks later. 
99% of desktop software developed in the 90's was vb and some packages still need support today ... and .net is used/taught at almost every university 
I stopped Googling. I have bookmarks for most important topics and man pages by now.
VBA a lot of people use office.
What? .Net is taught at very few universities.
Don't use reserved words even with pseudocode. What you're asking isn't so clear by the way. I would do something like obj.key1 in dictionary.values() That will tell you if the value of key1 of obj is a value anywhere in the dictionary's values. By the way, /r/learnpython 
in the uk its rather common for game design and CS degrees 
Maybe the snakes are becoming more popular.
basically the question is how to extract all dictionay values even those in second level ? How to move the post to /learnpython?
Actually, today’s VB (.NET) is virtually unrecognizable compared to VB 6 (from the 90’s).

This week has been quite busy for me since I'm a Starcraft 2 Caster and Observer. I have been having some fun with a new project that has been released and its all made in python, but it misses a couple of things I want like a singel elimination bracket where you enter the race and name of the player. The project also picks up map-statistics and project them out as HTML pages. Pretty cool stuff with other words.. Implementing a singel elimination bracket in an already this complicated project is WAY above what I have ever set myself on, but their is only one way to learn. Since my earlier python project has been quite simple and have never involved any sort of GUI, this is a new experience for me. Their is a lot of people who has made "singel elimination bracket" code earlier so I have a couple of examples that I can take a look at, but afaik (yet) it should be THAT hard to implement it. Wish me luck guys :). [Github link to the project Starcraft Casting Tool](https://github.com/teampheenix/StarCraft-Casting-Tool)
Yeah it does, not because its performance is worse than C/C++ or Fortran, which probably is, but because of the legacy codes. I have used several codes requires immense amount of computational power and parallelization, think like run a code for 6 months using 4000 cores, and none of them were python. I actually have never heard of somebody using python for this kind of stuff. Obviously this is completely anecdotal, but still should give an idea. Most likely there are some people out there developing high performance computing codes using python but saying C/C++ or Fortran losing their ground to python is simply not true. For your question, in my lab there are three people writing their own code, one of them uses C++ and the other two use Fortran. The code I'm using and somehow developing is Fortran. 
It's not just mypy. Python's typing system is poorly designed and that ship has kinda sailed. Having to import types for builtins and way too expressive.
/r/learnpython/wiki
Yes, that is true. Have you looked at rust? I just started poking around it. It looks fun.
Do you want to take the text and compute a coherent summary from it? Or do you you just want to get the exact text and format it somehow? 1 is easy. 2 depends on the above. 3 isn't very easy and depends on what you mean by relevant images i.e. Same vague category or directly related to a subset of the text (which I think is what you want). Again depends but neither is very easy. 4 easy 5 easy You're question really is too vague. Remember when ever it comes to speccing what you want a program to do, you have to be extremely specific and excessive else a misunderstanding will happen. 
Google doesn't deal well with just plonking a fat chunk of text in and getting relevant images. Even breaking the chunks down, it will need to create a context to pass to Google to yield valuable results which isn't trivial. Plenty of super easy to use TTS libraries available and most don't suck too badly even if they aren't as amazing as the Google TTS engine. 
Knock knock, 2007 called. Seriously, if you're learning Python now, you learn 3. End of story. 
Who's there? :)
It's not something frequently access so a dedicated tool above and beyond ssh and vim/na o is probably unnecessary. There also very powerful tools already available for configuring nginx and most have a GUI plus are built by people who really know nginx and the tools are backed by big companies. Don't be disheartened though, more tools isn't bad even if yours won't ever be used. Also something like this is still a great learning experience. 
VBA is still the weapon of choice for Office macros, which happen to be largely developed by people who are not programmers. What does a complete newb do, when he doesn’t know where to start? Google.
It has probably a lot to do with python being a popular beginner language.
Not quite true. There are a lot of things where python is pretty rubbish which is why we have things like DSLs. It's very weak in symbolic math for example and far too slow for real time applications. It's great in that it allows you to dabble in almost anything, but it's far from a jack of all trades as that implies some degree of competency in everything. Its a wonderful language that can do a lot in a friendly way with nice libraries. It cannot do everything anymore than any Turing complete language can do everything. 
Civil engineer here... yep what he says. Also I am catching a few you tube tutorials while in the train. Sentdex has some good ones for beginners. 
Its a lisp reference though...
Make sure you're actually running Python3. 7. I like to use pip like this: python3.7 -m pip install &lt;package&gt; This makes sure I'm installing the packages to the right python install on my system. 
Like enum for anybody who doesn't know but even using it here would be the wrong approach. 
I will give that a try, however, I only have 1 version installed.
Excellent input
Because there's no fixed definition for how many seconds are in a year, or in a month. Leap years exist, and months have different numbers of days.
Python principles being style or how we write code or both? If it's style just let a pep8 tool go nuts on their code and see how bad it is. If it's about how we write code then there are so many things to consider. For me being pythonic is being succinct and not repeating myself as well as being efficient by making heavy use of external libraries when they serve my purpose. Understandable code is golden so I don't like it when it reads like an attempt at code golf or a /r/iamverysmart nominee. So the only real question to ask is, "Can I see some of your code, and will you walk me through it." That will give you all the insight you need. 
I hardly doubt Python will lose much popularity on the coming years, but you'll see a few competitors out there. Most interesting and promising of them is Julia, but even that is still not officially released and doesn't have a community as big as Python or R, yet.
Skype doesn't have a python api. You can maybe use selenium and the Skype Web platform to scrape it and then process it. What you want really isn't clear... By the way, Skype for Business let's you integrate with your Exchange Server for contact storing etc. Maybe consider accessing it via exchange if you can. 
Does AWS block you when you hit the limit of the free tier or does it charge you ?
Yeah there is definitely something wrong about that graph.
So although this isn't quite what you're asking run your code on 3 and see what errors you get. Then slowly fix them. You'll very quickly see which changes affect you. Just maybe right something that changes how you use print because that error is going to get really exhausting really quickly. Apart from print, the only other thing that you'll find a stupid number of errors with it xrange as it's just range now. The Python official documentation has a nice summary of the big changes. And then just go through each point releases features. 
Despite that, `relativedelta` handled everything. In fact, it covers what timedelta can do, and much more. Hence my proposal to integrate it into standard library.

Do you have a source for that. I was SOOO hoping for python 
Somehow you make time stop and fly all at the same time.
I love boost.python and sip. Sip is how Qt is ported and is amazing and very underrated. Cython isn't fun, but swig isn't bad. Just realise that in most cases, creating a wrapper is going to be a decent amount of work although not an insane amount. Often you're better off looking for a python alternative that already has an underlying c library to use if performance matters. The syntax and concepts are often poorly communicated so you'll have a hard time creating wrappers in the beginning but it does get easier. 
Pandas is great for reading in and manipulating / processing data. For example, reading in an excel file can be done like this: # load pandas import pandas as pd pd.read_excel("some_excel_file.xlsx") pd.read_excel("another_excel_file.xlsx", sheet_name = "specific_sheet_name") # or, read in a CSV pd.read_csv("csv_file.csv") Then you can do whatever you need to with the data -- aggregate it, merge with other data, add / delete columns etc. For visualization, you could use matplotlib, but there's also seaborn, ggplot (like R's ggplot2), and plotly to name a few other options. 
This is good. Look forward to the videos.

Distribution is a major pita. I've only done it casually, but there's lots of things to consider: 1. You're distributing your source code 2. Single-executable tools tend to be large &amp; unwieldy, not always reliable 3. Target platform python version if you're not bundling the python interpreter. All the various tooling helps, but it's not perfect (imagine distributing to a RH5/6 system, where system python is 2.4).

wat?
how many universities did you survey to come to that conclusion?
Yes, because it keeps track of all the edge cases, and is thus extremely complicated.
Because it's *relative* delta. You know the exact date/datetime to which the delta is related to. And with that information you can take months/years into account. Such behaviour doesnt make sense when you dont have anything what the delta is related to: &gt;&gt;&gt; r = relativedelta(months=2) + relativedelta(months=2) relativedelta(months=+4) &gt;&gt;&gt; r.days 0 # since `month` is not an absolute unit &gt;&gt;&gt; tr = timedelta(days=20) + timedelta(days=20) timedelta(40) &gt;&gt;&gt; tr.days 40 
&gt;99% of desktop software developed in the 90's was vb lol it was? You sure about that..?
This post is better suited for r/learnpython
It deserves it for what it does. Like it's simple to read if you write good code, it is flexible for many different applications and can be used in conjunction with C/C++ easily which allows it to connect to a lot of libraries that are already there. The development was amazing 
No one likes JS honestly and a lot of colleges thought VB back in the last 10 years. It has slowly been creeping out and going to python instead but there are still a lot of latent VB idiots around calling themselves developers 
Just google it, it was news a bit ago
Like it or not, JS is everywhere. Even inside ASP. 
Someone tell them it's the blue collar job of this era
I prefer JS to PHP but both can die in a fire. It makes me pray for the day webassembly brings Python to the web. 
Then there are those who search for Java
JS is client side (except Node), while PHP is server side. Kind of apples and oranges.
Well I just mean both are shit, not specifically about client side or server side. 
Dooes your apm product support .net? Ive always felt, and still feel that Java and .net share the enterprise space pretty evenly, sometimes even in the same company. 
https://www.xlwings.org/
Same can be said for timedelta. You left out this part. &gt;&gt;&gt; r = relativedelta(months=2) + relativedelta(months=2) &gt;&gt;&gt; r.months 4 And this part. &gt;&gt;&gt; t = timedelta(days=2) &gt;&gt;&gt; t.seconds 0 So... my argument still stand. `relativedelta` is a far superior replacement.
VB.NET really isn't that bad, just super wordy imo
It isn't.
Ranking by search engine popularity seems like a strange way to find the most popular language. No way visual basic is more popular than PHP AND JavaScript.

sure. i don't get your point.. you said you've already made the function for scraping! then all you need is loop throughout the column for search queries, which simply can be done by methods like [pandas.Series.iteritems()](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.Series.iteritems.html#pandas.Series.iteritems).
It's not weakly typed, it's strongly typed. 
Thank you for your thoughtful comments. I think you should look at Dask: this and things like this are the way of the highly-parallel future. When combined with Numba, it gives you scale up and scale down, across both embarrassingly-parallel workloads and MPI-like tasks. It's not true that relying on the C or C++ compiler will automatically give you the best performance in your kinds of scenarios. It's particularly untrue if you consider the human-in-the-loop productivity of having to optimize or fine-tune your code when moving between various hardware (e.g. GPUs).
&gt; And what it is is a **weakly** typed language with an incredible capacity to fail at runtime You're mistaken. Python is a strongly typed language. You might be thinking of dynamically typed. Python is definitely that. Just last week, I wrote a plugin for a larger framework. This plugin had to be fast because I was going to be doing 200 executions of this plugin every minute. I wrote the plugin in Python, C++, Perl, and C# to see which would perform the fastest. Surprisingly, Python and C++ were about the same at 100ms. C# was slightly faster at 70ms. And Perl was dog slow at 400ms. (The task was parsing a 12MB file and then quickly pulling out about 30 lines of data.) I decided to stick with Python because it would have been too difficult to get .NET Core onto our Linux server. &gt; for anything that reaches over a few hundred lines Honestly, I used to say the same thing about Python. Then I wrote a 3000 line project. I've written plenty of code in Python (command-line tools and web apps) that have exceeded 5000 lines of code. PyCharm definitely helps when writing larger projects. I couldn't imagine writing similar command-line tools and applications in C. Probably wouldn't want to write it in C++ either, though I could imagine writing it in C# or Java or Scala or some language like that.
You can probably use `.values()` after [flattening](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6027558/flatten-nested-python-dictionaries-compressing-keys) the dictionary.
This is actually true. And there's still a smattering of PHP out there. Surprisingly, Go is actually starting to show up at very large orgs. I know this because I'm slowly coercing my very large org into writing go...
Thanks - I'm pretty sure I've missed learning some pretty basic stuff as I've been trying to pick this up. 
Thank you for the link. The fog clears a little more.
Were you using an ORM? ORMs were designed for such "impedance mismatch" type problems. Honestly, I've never understood the "fail silently" thing. That's a recipe for disaster and all-round bad practice. &gt; duck type style language C# has duck typing and Anonymous types and support for dynamic types. Whomever wrote your C# app clearly didn't know that it's had such features.
&gt; as it is a php based web-server PHP isn't inherently slow by any means. Take these with a grain of salt but [these benchmarks put PHP 7.2 ahead of Python 3.7 in every test](https://benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net/benchmarksgame/faster/php.html). Though those aren't real-world scenarios..

Yeah, VBA was my gateway drug into programming. I was writing code on and off for about a year in VBA before switching to Python. A pretty sizable number of the Google searches for VBA in 2017 were probably just me having to re-check over and over again how VBA arrays work (hint: not well).
Someone doesn't code enough to keep their parentheses straight...I bet da Joos did this.
Yes, function annotations have been in place since Python 3.0; all 3.6 adds are *variable annotations*, described [here](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0526/). (In fact OP you may want to edit the OP to clarify)
I strongly agree with you, but I'm also curious -- do you have an alternative system in mind that could work better for Python?
yes most was vb4 then vb6 and around xp we moved to .net
Function annotations, i.e. type-hints on function parameters, have been in place since Python 3.0.
I thought of the same joke. Im sorry it didn't go well for you.

Sorted it anyway, it turns out it was only pycrypt. Playing around with hashlib instead. It wasn't supposed to be a detailed question I wanted to know if others were having problems with the updated python version or if it was something else. It's called problem solving by elimination.
No thats a separate chart
My bad, I didn't realize most software in the 90s was written by you and you're able to state such fact.
I’ve looked at it yeah, not very suitable for me though as I do mostly ML stuff.
We do have a .NET agent. It's fairly new and it is blowing the fuck up, customers are all over that shit.
Don't catch you spamming now 
There are these two packages `Dictdiffer` and `deepdiff` that do something like that. They are kind of defective when it comes to the prime time, but for simple cases like yours they should be fine.
Are we sure the article wasn't just grouping VBA in with Visual Basic though? For it to be that high on the list, it almost seems like they must have.

Yeah its really easy once you get the hang of it and has a lot of power. I just created a combo box that loops through all the file system objects in a different folder based on which check box a user picks and populated the file names so the user can pick a location to save in raher than navigating through the file system. Pretty proud of it though it can take a second to load the largest folder.

Thanks, OP was clarified. 
- For which version of Python is this tool targeted? The shebang says 3 but `print_function` is imported. - There's a mix of `print`s and `sys.stdout.write`. - There are these `args` last arguments to functions which are expected to be dictionaries. Can't they be `**kwargs`? - Why not package it like a proper python program?
Some proper code formatting won't hurt. It's very hard to read when the font is the same as the text paragraphs and there's no highlighting.
Ok let me rephrase that. Python has third party libraries that can do almost anything. GUI, databases, Android programming, game programming, Web development, data science, scientific computing, algebraic manipulation, linear algebra, plotting, systems programming and scripting, machine learning, machine vision, markdown compilation, static site generation, build systems for other programming languages, serial port programming, manipulating hardware and much more. Not many languages out there can do all this, at least not with the ease and grace of Python. Python's main disadvantage is its slow execution speed and while it can be used for almost everything it might not be optimal for somethings. For example Android programming e.t.c. This makes Python, 'Jack of all trades, Master of some'
I would advise you to look into some language in the ML family, like OCaml, F# or even Haskell. A lot of people think that Rust's type system is a novelty but it isn't. It's heavily influenced by ML languages' type systems.

It is a Slack bot using Slack's Pytho client to hit the API and consume the messages. From there I simply pass the messages to a class for processing/formatting if my bot was mentioned in the chat message. The message itself is processed using Spacy which is an NLP library.
Also curious about this as well. I work in ecology lab where we do a lot data analysis. I decided to learn python, rather than R, but my boss keeps pushing for R. I rather learn python because it has more uses than R, which is strictly for statistical analysis ( at least to my knowledge). 
IIRC they do provide the raw data if you are willing to pay
A lot of people have written on "why Rust" but it boils down to C-like speed without stepping on rakes. I don't use it for the things Python does well, but for the things Python doesn't do so well (like having confidence the program won't throw a type error in the last minute of a 12 hour analysis)
As someone with a working knowledge of R, you're absolutely right. It's difficult to interface R with anything in my experience, Python has a much larger reach when it comes to interacting with other bits of software and automation.
You can navigate the dict and compare values, or navigate the class and compare values. But I would perform a conversion on one/both of the data structures so they are in the same format. Either * format the dict in a way that it can be compared to the object * format the object in a way that can be compared to the dict * convert both into a format that already has built in comparison I would opt for creating an object method that builds a dict out of it's values. It would allow direct comparison against the other dict and it has a lot of side benefits. Such as making your object able to be pickled. It can then be serialized by all sorts of other libraries, it can take advantage of all the snippets of code that already deal with dicts, you can dump your object to json easily, etc. Lots of options when you're working with a builtin type.
I actually had some ideas about what information may be useful to keep with the code in order to prove some aspects of program's correctness. Here's one: it is possible to think about object's states as an automata, since any language can be approximated by finite automata, for the purpose of this example, we can limit it to DFA / regular expressions. So, in this system, classes would have to carry information on possible state changes of objects produced from such classes in, say, a form of DFA. Then, method invocation of objects produced from these classes would be validated against this DFA. Here's an example, in an imaginary Python augmented with these "types": class File: open(read|write|seek)*close def open(): open self.fd = os.open() ... def read(): read return self.fd.read() def write(buffer): write ... def seek(): seek ... def close(): close self.fd.close() The system using these annotations would then be able to tell that: f = File() f.open() f.seek() f.close() typechecks and that: f = File() f.write() f.close() doesn't.
Mostly because the reddit circlejerk surrounding python. I didnt have a job apun graduating with an engineering degree so i started learning python to build my resume. Ended up falling in a cheminformatics job by chance. So basically, dumb chance

I'm building an example real time analysis pipeline with docker, python and tensor flow, backed by kafka and with protobufs as a data interchange format. Should have a write up / blog post for it by the end of the month. It's mostly plumbing work and some writing libraries for making sure kafka is easy to use with the protobufs. Last week I wrote the base of the prediction and image diff parts which works nicely and stops you having to predict on every frame. Plus a little bit of hacker rank (has any one actually had to solve those kind of problems in recent history in anger rather than just for job interviews) since I need some practice as it's job hunting season.
Spyder is designed to look more like matlab.
Or would it? I don't see all that many reasons to google the letter c alone.
VS Code is how I do Python dev: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/python
This is one of my biggest gripes about Python really, no matter how much I use it, I still google things and doublecheck them in a REPL more than in any other language I have used.

If you are willing to deviate a bit more from the basic MATLAB layout while still keeping much of the same capabilities, then the Jupyter Notebook is a good choice. 
PyCharm
It is not really very similar to MATLAB, though.
Holy shit I think I understand now what the origin of the word noob is

No, it's not, but it does have the console, path browser, and IDE features OP is looking for. I may have misunderstood, but I took the question to mean that they were looking for an editor with more advanced tools like that found in Matlab, but for general Python development.

You were correct. But it doesn’t seem to have a variable explorer so I’m probably gonna go with Spyder. Thanks for the info though

So if the text was about dogs doing a particular action like running then a picture of a dog running.

you're distributing a jar full of bytecode. and possibly with all the dependencies included. not the same as distributing source code. 
 To be clear: I'm not saying mypy has a bad type system. I'm saying it isn't as stable or featureful as I'm sure we'd all like. That doesn't make it "poorly designed". Secondly, no ship has sailed. We've been talking about moving things like any and optional into the builtins and moving typing support into the ABC module, so that you very rarely have to import typing. When you say "expressive" I presume you mean verbose, because a lot of expresivity is a good thing in a type system :) Yeah names are kinda verbose. We are well aware the names are less than ideal. However, what syntax is better? Using `thing?` wouldn't be Pythonic much like Python doesn't use &amp;&amp; for and. 
Is there a difference between postgresql and MySQL? What should a newbie learn?

Spyder does look a lot like Matlab, but I haven't used it that much yet. Pycharm Professional has scientific mode which has some Matlab like features, and it's free if you're a student. I also second jupyter lab, I'm getting used to it and jupyter notebooks lately and it's quite nice actually. Plenty of features and very easy to run snippets of code and explore your data.

Numba was designed for this, it supports pure python and a fair amount of [numpy functionality](https://numba.pydata.org/numba-doc/dev/reference/numpysupported.html). OpenCL support is non existant unfortunately. Though after looking at OpenCL documentation apparently it looks to be just C code. If you could figure out how to get all the boilerplate to work I'd imagine you might actually be able to chain through OpenCL &lt;=&gt; Cython &lt;=&gt; Numpy &lt;=&gt; Python for your project. This would probably the the fastest and most platform independent you could get (Dang Apple and deprecating OpenCL on mac). Anyway back to Numba, cross platform functionality is actually there for it. The master branch supports Cuda for Nvidia and HSA for AMD APUs but recently they also added alpha AMD dgpu support with ROCm, but thats a Linux only thing as for now with no idea about if Windows will get support. Theres also an experimental branch of numba which hasn't had any commits for about 4 years now which is called AMD dgpu, god know how you could possibly get that to work. Apart from that I mean [PyOpenCL](https://documen.tician.de/pyopencl/index.html) actually supports numpy itself! When you make PyOpenCL "arrays" you actually need to pass them numpy ndarrays. Looking at the documentation it doesn't seem all that terrible honestly.
Also I would say the trend downwards for Fortran and the trend upward in Python are correlated. Largely since a lot of the scientific coders have adopted Python for any kind of coding that is not heavy number crunching.
At the very least one thing I love about python is being able to test code blocks in REPL without having to compile a small test section when I want to see how something behaves.
I can recommend you an online course from Microsoft: https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-python-for-data-science-1 This course covers the basics of both Python and Data Analysis (it says DataScience but only covers the Data Analysis part). From there you can take branch into other courses. It is important to note that Machine Learning requires that you are comfortable with Statistical models. I will let that at the end after you have got confidence with Data Analysis. For Data Analysis, the situation is easier, you will mostly need to learn: * Numpy (Mostly understand how it works) * Pandas (This is the most important one) * Matplotlib (For plotting your data) * Seaborn (For prettier and more robust plotting) My advice is to learn as much as you can about Pandas, that tool is very versatile.

How is it that different from a lambda? 
It's even more popular than that. It's super widespread in mechanical engineering for actual engineering software. I'm only recently seeing python eek it's way in.
lambdas are a single line. As I'm sure you can imagine, there's a world a difference between functions that can be any number of lines and functions that can be one line.

In Python 3, everything is unicode. That cannot be a problem unless you have some investment in Py2already over the years. Bachelor eng students by definition cannot have such legacy. I am teaching numerical linear algebra and there is absolutely nothing that requires Py2. Its time has simply passed.
It would be sad if there was no way to do multi line anonymous functions.

Yes, in Py3 strings and unicode are one and the same, but the actual behavior of some unicode code point characters act differently. For example, some special german characters used to capitalize normally, but now when capitalizing they get turned into two english characters that are phonetically similar. Students have such legacies when doing personal projects in Py2 merely because that is what they are taught. Yes, there is nothing that *requires* Py2. But it is still the version that is taught and it gets ingrained in them when they graduate.

How are fat arrows not readable? Compare: myObj.on('change', function(oldVal, newVal) { this.render(newVal); }); With myObj.on('change', (oldVal, newVal) =&gt; this.render(newVal)); Also maps and filters, without fat-arrow: let someList = [1, 2, 3] .map(function(val) { return val * 2; }) .filter(function(val) { return val &gt; 2; }); With fat-arrow: let someList = [1, 2, 3] .map((val) =&gt; val * 2) .filter((val) =&gt; val &gt; 2); It removes a lot of clutter which helps immensely with readability IMHO.
In Python you can write nested functions, so I'm failing to see how a large multiline anonymous function would be better...?
I'm writing code for a digital humanities research project; it extracts dialogue from novels, then runs various features over it (sentence length, expletives, lexical density, etc...). The end goal is using machine learning to try and teach a program to classify a novel as genre or literary (lowbrow and highbrow, basically) given just the dialogue. So far, to about 85 % accuracy over a small selection of novels, it seems like percentage of dialogue, expletives, reference to self (interestingly enough) and types of sentences (simple all the way to compound complex) seem to be the biggest indicators. I'm not a computer savvy guy, pretty much first real programming project, and I'm really happy with it!
Don't get me wrong, it's great. But I wish I could stop *having* to do it.

well best way would be to reverse engineer the post/get requests and use smth like urllib or requests module to replicate the browser behavior or if thats not possible then use selenium and browser automation - but the first way would be much more efficient

Yep you nailed it. The business was a data analytics consulting firm before it ever had an app so all of the db schemas were originally ‘designed’ by consultants. The app was then built years later by inexperienced devs to give the clients an interface to their data but the consultants still wanted to be able to have direct backend access and change shit on the fly so the ORM fight was long lost. All in all it was not an ideal first taste of a C# app or first engineering job in general. 
Python will not become antiquated.
More Python sessions with co-workers! And helping on 3 small automation projects from these same co-workers =)
I hope not, but it's impossible to predict.

Why would you do this? One of its strengths seems to be the massive number of libraries to extend vanilla Python. Having said that, I can see situations where you’d want to work offline. Here’s the concept I’d imagined, but never built. Have an online VM image, built from a script of needs be, that contained all the libraries required. Then take a one way copy of that VM to your offline machine, using as many verification and other intermediate steps as required. It’s a bit clunky but might work, I’ll go look at you github now!
Pycharm community edition with cell mode plugin will do the job. I switched to this setup after 8 years of Matlab and I really like it. The plugin is replicating the cell mode functionality of Matlab.
It makes JS MORE readable yes. Because JS is filled with syntax. Compared to python it is a downgrade in readability 
Alright cool, sometimes ya just need a nudge in a direction and that was it! In a quick comparison search of the 3 it seems Haskell edges out but I’m gonna dig into them all and see what sticks. Thanks!
What do you mean with "from AWS"? Do you have a kinesis stream there or do you mean something else? 
Python couldn't even make I more smarter 
What's the point of comparing JavaScript with JavaScript though? Write the idiomatic Python to perform those same operations and compare those.
Polling ECS/EC2 info is what I'm seeking to do
Because I interpreted the comment I was replying to as saying the fat arrow does not make javascript code more readable, and in my opinion it does
IIRC, Guido prefers Python's list and dict comprehensions as an alternative to anon funcs, map/filter/reduce etc. lambda and JS's arrows appear to do similar things, although JS's arrow is much cleaner. I see this is a culture issue. Python's community doesn't value anon funcs, even though the language supports it with bulkier syntax.
Ive been thinking about this a lot. I’m a third year CS student at a top 15 university. It seems like there’s a lot of smart kids who go into CS as a way to make money (rather than finance or some shit). However, the amazing thing is most of those people end up changing majors because if ur not into computers science you will fucking hate it. The school I go to is very difficult and therefore the intro classes weed out the people who are just in it for the money and have no real passion. I have no problem with people studying CS because it has good job prospects. Because if you can stick with then obviously you like it and deserve to make as much money as possible. 
You can predict anything using any method you choose. The trick is seeing those predictions come true. Any time you extrapolate out of a data set you're stepping off into the unknown. Short answer: No
That is true forJavaScript, but the context of the top comment was specifically about bringing it to Python and the relative readability with Python syntax. Python is deliberately light on symbol style operators, and there is typically a "Pythonic" way to do many of those types of tasks with things like list comprehensions, rather than tons of anonymous functions and map/filter. If you look into the history of the language, it's been curated very deliberately despite thousands of "can you implement syntax X from language Y?" and is better for it. There are tradeoffs of course, with limitations like the single line lambdas etc. but on balance the language is better for it. It is very idiomatic, so coming from some languages and immediately trying to write code like those is basically always the wrong approach.
The sample chapters on Manning's live book look like gibberish: "nza dv liiarvytl ntestadalr ejrn z recursive Vtnoyh ouncnitf (c reuvceisr "
I'm not very good at the mechanics of website design. Do you know how to emulate the actions on the browser? Do you know how to point out CSS selectors?
I find data structures very difficult as well. I know what I need to logically develop and how it should function. But getting the functions to do what I want is my challenge. I guess the same thing can be said for any language. We know exactly what we want to say in our head but when we say it, it sometime doesn’t convey what we really mean. Only way to get better is through trial/error/feedback. 
Yes the JavaScript fat arrow function is a closure - it takes on the outer scope - extremely useful. Generally useful, but in particular I think multiline anonymous functions go a long way towards making async programming understandable and readable.
I remember seeing this a day or so ago! Here's a couple nitpicks: - The `PlayerName` class could be replaced by a dictionary structure, as it essentially just holds four values and has no methods that act on them. If you were to expand the player class for a more complicated program, however, then that would probably be a more fitting option. Also, to be *ultra*-nitpicky, I'd just call it `Player` instead of `PlayerName`. It's less object-like to call it that. - You have a double-layered `while True`. I suppose it ensures your program never terminates, but it's an odd structure. - There's some redundancy in a few places, like for example: `if player_name[turn].in_jail == True:` can just be `if player_name[turn].in_jail:` Other than that it seems good for what it aims to accomplish. As far as style goes it adheres pretty well to the norm as well. 
Sure, try this: entry.delete(0, tk.END)
entry.delete("1.0",END)
There's real readability and clarity to positioning an anonymous function right at the point in the code that is will be used. When you define a function some other place and use it elsewhere, you have increased the overall complexity. What is this named function? Where is it used? Is it accessed by other bits of code? Should it be? All these questions come up when you see a named function. It is often the case that you know an anonymous function will only ever be used once, in this particular bit of code so it is much more clean, readable and understandable if the anonymous function lives right there. Especially valuable in reducing the complexity of async programming.
The second (nested) loop is if the player rolls doubles, it'll have the player roll again. The first loop is to keep the program running until it's told to quit.
I'm pretty glad I really enjoy computers and programming. I'm an electrical engineer who uses C/C++ at work but I've been growing more and more used to Python over the past several years. I'm starting to think I might be able to get my feet wet in some simple freelance work.
&gt;- The `PlayerName` class could be replaced by a dictionary, as it essentially just holds four values and has no methods that act on them. I'd recommend either a named tuple or one of the new fangled data classes if you're using 3.7.
The point is not the symbol. The point is that Python can't do inline multiline anonymous functions. That's a big bit of missing power.
&gt; named tuple Interesting. I haven't ever used those before. What is the benefit of a named tuple over a dictionary? 
Yup. This week I discovered that a colleague was going through a spreadsheet, putting the values manually into a word template, saving as PDF and saving in a directory. Like 10 a day. I automated this with python - all she does now is drag the spreadsheet onto the pyinstaller executable and it generates a folder with all of the word files and pdf docs. Libraries used: * PETL (processing the data) * Easygui (some simple gui prompts) * tqdm (progress bar) * docx-mailmerge (generate the documents) * win32com (control Word to generate pdfs) 
import data x= data.solve() print(x)
MultiLine anonymous functions are hard to read. Putting them in stuff like map and for each is ugly. 
Some packages that include binaries that are tied to a specific version may not be updated yet. I had initial issues with lxml - not sure if that’s sorted yet. 
Yes - this course is soooo good. 
Damn. I must have missed the rule where users of /r/python had to love python more than any other language.
Ya Python is awesome it’s the first language I learned back in high school. What kind of stuff have u been doing with it? For freelance stuff I’d recommend looking at using libraries for web scraping and maybe some data mining/ML stuff.
As a follow up thought to the original post, I wonder if "Python feels like it has nothing to learn from JavaScript". There's a real disdain for JavaScript by "real programmers" so the suggestion that JavaScript might do some things better might be challenging to people. It's interesting that the newest versions of JavaScript are lifting some of their new functionality directly from Python. There's value in Python lifting some of the best bits of JavaScript too.
Yes, I'm not advocating copying the fat arrow syntax to python. Like I said, I was simply trying to point out that it makes JS more readable.
You can only store the specified fields. All fields are required. You can access them directly as attributes instead of by string (eg `foo.bar` instead of `foo['bar']`). Smaller memory footprint (negligible unless you have many).
Yep, I love this kind of stuff. It's crazy to think that some people actually spends time manually doing tasks like that.
[prompt_toolkit](https://python-prompt-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/master/pages/asking_for_input.html#password-input) will do this (and a huge amount more).
It's not nice to make fun of those with speech impediments either.
&gt; (Note that your `print(num1)` example produced exactly the same number of digits that you typed.) Looks like it's rounded to me.
What's a search engine? 
New JS versions like Typescript have nice things like a proper Map (Like Python's dict), arrow syntax, spread functions, and for in loops. Unfortunately, the bundling system, and node-based ecosystem's difficult, and the internet's filled with low-quality tutorials and articles.
Python already uses the thin arrow symbol for function annotations https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3107/ def foo(a: 'x', b: 5 + 6, c: list) -&gt; max(2, 9): ... 
Cool, I think we are actually in agreement then ;)

For folks that don't get it, there's a thing, I think mostly Twitter, where white supremacists use ((( ))) around people's names to indicate that they are Jewish. Puerile joke, sure, but he's probably poking fun of the Nazis and not really acting like one.
What's the relationship between that directory structure and this python's `site_packages/` directory? Does `site_packages/main_package/` exist? Does `site_packages/main_package/__init__.py` exist?
Yes it appears to be an issue with pycrypt, other libraries work fine
&gt; There's real readability and clarity to positioning an anonymous function right at the point in the code that it will be used. def something_complicated(): data = lots_of_complicated_setup() def only_used_here(x): foo = do_stuff(x) bar = do_other_stuff(x) return foo, bar return do_the_complicated_things(map(only_used_here, data)) It's not quite as pretty as if you had defined only_used_here inline, but it's probably as good as you're going to get given Python's syntax.
You can most definitely write mission critical software in python: I write healthcare software in python. It's easy to write, easy to test and easy to reason about. I haven't seen evidence that C or Java are any more reliable than python.
Try: ```r = requests.post(url, data=postData)``` Also double check the you are using the correct url, got all the postdata, headers, ect with the network tab in your browser's developer tools. 
The big win of Javascript's arrow functions is that `this` is bound properly, which you didn't mention. Before arrow functions, you could already define an inline function: `myArray.map(function(x) { return x + 1; });` But if you used `this`, it would point at `window` (in the browser). You'd have to do `(function(x) { return this.foo; }).bind(myObj)` to get it to work properly. This was particularly confusing if you tried to pass around an object's method as a callback. However, in Python, that all works by default! So the major selling point of arrow functions is completely moot for Python.
It's a new project so it's just in some random directory. There is an \_\_init__.py in all of the packages but the main_package one is empty. Do I need to add the parent package into my interpreter's site_packages for sub packages to properly see each other? 
My oldest is a CS major because he's a math/CS geek. His roommate was a CS/SE major for the money. He'd never even written a program before in his entire life! The school says they don't set up the early classes to weed those people out, but it ends up working that way anyway.
Yep, also a third year in a top 10 uni. Computer Science has grown exponentially in the past 10 years here, and everyone takes the intro courses now. However, many people hate it because they don't have a passion for programming, and are only in it to get rich. 
This is an interesting idea. It lines up with something I've started noticing among some coworkers. I don't know if it's because software engineers have gotten more blue collar-y or that I've just started noticing it. By "blue collar-y" I mean they put their head down, code their little bit and don't care about the larger problem being solved. Assembly line production, ha ha.
Because these numbers are based on a bad source. Much better to look at github statistics.
Hi, I already tried posting the data. I made sure I had all the headers, etc. It's still not logging in. It's only returning the login page again. I think I have to call the JavaScript callback function? I can't use Selenium for my use case. Any ideas?
It sounds crazy on first pass, but the people googling a Kardashian are probably doing it at most once or twice a day. People writing Python are googling Python questions 10+ times a day just because it's simpler than looking up arg order for functions you don't often use, or are looking for libraries, or looking error messages, etc. Then, consider that when your first google query didn't return what you wanted, so you resubmit with more/fewer qualifiers, etc. it makes total sense. It's also the name of an animal (as well as part of its namesake), though I'm not sure how much of a difference that makes. For comparison, [here's](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&amp;q=c%2B%2B,%2Fm%2F0261x8t) c++ v. Kim Kardashian and it's not even close.
That's not language or web framework specific.

Lambda and the arrow function are both anonymous functions. Essentially, in theory, they are the same thing. I think its more important to realize that Python is not JavaScript. Python is a general purpose programming language while JavaScript is the language of the web. I think this is an important distinction to make to begin with. Many languages will have different paradigms and styles and Pythons shows through its lack of use of brackets and its mandatory structure of blocks. In JavaScript, scoping is usually public and anonymous functions assist it creating private scopes that aren't as easily accessible. This is done through the use of closures which is unique to its own paradigm. I think the best thing to accept that different languages accomplish different things and work in a similar fashion because the base logic is always there. Languages are typically designed to accomplish a specific set of goals and attempts to achieve those goals as best as they can. The simple truth is that python doesn't really need them because its syntax handles public and private values in its own way and adding arrow functions to the language would just be unnecessary because the language just doesn't require it. Best advice is that Its best to just follow the style of the language you write in and the result of that will cause you less frustration in the long run.

I heard about Numba but I wasn't aware it supported non-CUDA platforms. I'm not sure I completely understand how exactly it uses a non-CUDA GPU, since it doesn't seem to use OpenCL or Vulkan, but it seems to be worth looking into. I actually am using Linux and intend to keep my code in a Linux environment, so that caveat is a non-issue for me. So - thanks for the suggestion. I also considered the idea of taking the Numpy C code and figure out how to cram that into the OpenCL compiler with pyopencl, but I have a hunch it's going to be a bit more complicated than I expect. I doubt I'm the first or only person looking for this (hence my question - maybe someone actually did the dirty work already, or at least knows for certain what's necessary to make a Numpy function work properly). Though I'm confident a GPU will process my workload faster, I don't know if it'd make enough of a difference to warrant the effort to dive into this myself. But anyway, thanks for the heads up that pyopencl already supports numpy arrays. That's one less thing to worry about, if I attempt this.
Have you looked for an API document on the clocks?
Wouldn't test-driven development obviate the need for static types, which introduce massive amounts of scaffolding solely to catch the most simplest of errors? 
Aside from the already mentioned Numba, there's CuPy, but that is also CUDA and not OpenCL. https://cupy.chainer.org/ Generally CUDA has a pretty strong lock on things in the scientific GPU realm. Personally I would suggest you just accept that fact. Also keep in mind many simple image processing tasks will be faster on CPU than GPU, so benchmark everything. Generally I find only iterative tasks run faster on GPU. Otherwise memory-transfer rates tend to be the limiting factor, so CPU wins.

Breaking up your code into smaller, digestible pieces with sensible organization is always the right path! Then your the code for your main process can be focused on the logic required for that specific task, and your classes can handle the logic for interacting with the objects you’re accessing. Keep at it!

I'll have to check that out. I also plan on implementing this in Rust soon as well since I'm trying to learn Rust.
You’re close. Good news is it’s actually simpler than maybe you’re thinking. When x is an integer, it is passed by value. When it is an object or array then it is kind of like by reference. More like x is the address of that object. Calling the append function modifies the array that x references. However, if you were to reassign x inside the function it would not affect the x outside the function, because when x is an array or object it’s really more akin to a pointer in C. This concept leads to understanding the difference between a shallow copy and a deep copy. Quick point: the assigning of the number to x inside the example function has no effect because x is passed by value, so you’re overwriting the copy of x that was passed in rather than making x point at a new number. Perhaps more useful is a tip: code is much easier to read and understand if you don’t modify objects that are passed in. Wherever practical, try to return a new state without changing anything that’s passed in. Unexpected side effects are an excellent source of frustrating bugs. Hope this helps. 
Thank you man, you've helped me more than you know. It seems like I was almost there, expect the fact that everything is by reference, unless its just a simple plain sight value, such as an integer its passed by value. I would give a go at saying string is also passed as value? It would be good if there was a table to check what was passed by value or reference, but I'm guessing I should pick that up in no time.

Thanks! So, the way that I import all these classes while having a single py that starts the application - That is a good way to do this?

Very interested in what you find as I was just thinking this today. I built my own scraper but I want to be able to host it as a web app and have users input a URL for what they want scraped. Not sure how the user would input the HTML elements necessary. Nor how would I get it to execute properly. Please update if you find anything.
I'd venture there's no benefit to this. Numpy vectorized operations are extremely fast. The bottleneck is python. Like, if you increase the size of a numpy array 10 fold, many operations take essentially the same amount of time to execute. Most of the time is spent in python *around* the data rather than in machine code *on* the data. The time it takes to marshal the data to and from the gpu between each operation is going to be way more than the time it takes to execute on the cpu. The only solution is to compile a kernel that executes completely on the gpu so that 1) You don't end up transferring data between each operation and 2) you don't have python orchestrating things between each operation. Numba is such a technology though iirc the numpy api is not working yet for the gpu backend. Numba is young and ambitious and moving quickly so check on this yourself. **You should actually profile your code and optimize based on that before you jump to the conclusion that running on a gpu will actually help your specific situation.**
Hey, this is pretty nifty! I'd recommended posting this on the Python-ideas mailing list. If you are interested in having it become part of CPython I'd recommend you read the devguide and make a PR! 
I just started working on a simple 2d planetary motion simulator. It works purely by using Newton's law of Gravitation and other basic Newtonian physics. At the moment, it's purely mathematical and I'm using pyplot as implemented by pylab to see the results being plotted. Short term goals are to implement a proper frontend for it so you can play with simulations on the fly, kinda like a poor-mans Universe Sandbox. Long term goal is to make it fully 3d so I can have an actual proper simulation of the solar system and other planetary systems. So far, playing around with it has been a blast, so I'm really trying to get that front-end done so I can see the graphs that are being made actually play out on the screen. Here's the github link: [https://github.com/Humbl3Stud3nt/G-SIM](https://github.com/Humbl3Stud3nt/G-SIM) (I know, I really need to fix the README. I'm working on it), so please feel free to check it out.
Yes, I think you’ve got it! Strings are special cases in python and aren’t like C strings. In python, strings are immutable, so even though technically it is passed in as a reference, you can’t change it in your function and you’ll want to return a new string. If you needed performance for a tight loop string operation, then there are libraries for character arrays that are mutable. 
Thanks for the well thought out response

Flask is your best bet! A single endpoint to take the submitted form and kick off the crawler. The [official docs](http://flask.pocoo.org/) will tell you everything you need for it.
OP , If you're thinking of making it a open source software , I'd love to collaborate
Thanks much for kind words :) I have posted it here : https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-ideas/2018-July/052463.html I have been contributing to CPython for the past two weeks. I made a small PR this week were some of the errors were returning 1 arguments which could be nice to be read as 1 argument in the message. It got merged and I got some more exposure towards error reporting. I worked on this idea after looking into errors and type hints. Sure I will raise a PR and hope the discussion gains traction on the mailing list. I don't know whether the core team will accept this and the complexity involved to handle edge cases but it was a fun hack nevertheless. The implementation seems simple for me. It's to get the current function object by name from globals and look up __annotations__ for the function object. If it has annotations then it will return the error with annotations. If not it will throw the normal error. This doesn't break existing code but improves upon ones with type annotations and the errors are much more useful. The only part where it's slow is to get the globals and do a lookup of the function object. Then to iterate through __annotations__. Most of them are hash lookups which I think won't slowdown and in most user cases this is an error and pretty much end of the script unless they catch it which most won't. 1 argument PR : https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/1426daa4fe47d8f8be0d416f7cba7adae1d5839f Thanks again :)
Writing a bulk http import utility to do bulk news ingestion for nlp processing. Needs to async execute request while not killing the server, handle rest API paging, site by site credential handling and routers to put the data in the right end location . Takes a few Json files to configure the whole bulk job. First real python project, I love how fast I am developing but I must admit I miss my static types 
It's a project for school, but as soon as that grade comes through I'll make everything open source on GitHub and we can make it better
I use Flask as my backend and JS/Jquery One thing I built was a crawler that saves products with images. Then I have another python/flask that displays it as a webpage. i can add delete buttons to delete products with one click and it disappears without reloading. To me the python/sql/scraping is the easy part, the JS/jquery was harder to wrap my head around but luckily you dont need to know much to get a prototype working. I generate HTML with Flask and templates and usually throw a SQL product ID as an HTML entity id like &lt;a hred=# id=46&gt; and some jquery event listeners for clicks which call flask routes with that id
Flask is a good way to go. That said, you'd be fine kicking off the Python crawler with something like https://github.com/extrabacon/python-shell if you did want to write the web app in JavaScript with Node/Express. Just keep i mind that if the web crawler takes a long time to run, you should use an async queue. Here's an example of how to do that with Flask and Redis-Queue -&gt; https://testdriven.io/asynchronous-tasks-with-flask-and-redis-queue.
Ha, looks like we are on the same timeline. Working on a real time prediction system using the same stack: https://github.com/carlomazzaferro/kryptoflow alongside with some leetcode. Are you open sourcing your code? Would love to take a look!
I think my dilemma is just that it seems very bulky at that point. Wondering if the main py should just multiprocess the other py's instead.
it's easy with flask. from flask import Flask from flask import jsonify app = Flask(\_\_name\_\_) @app.route("/") def index(): json = {"data":"hola"} return jsonify(json) if \_\_name\_\_ = "\_\_main\_\_": [app.run](https://app.run)() there you have a server with flask. XD

oBad book. "reference" and "value" is just unnecessary terminology imported from C. Better to talk of Scalar, Vectors and Immutables.
Why are you getting those errors in the first place? That's what I'd fix. 
this is your best bet. Use flask as a restful API endpoint. Once user fills in all details, send request to your flask API with all the variables needed.

This. Understand the fundamentals of what a Python object is, and you’ll see how neither pass by reference or pass by value applies. Mutability is key.

Bulky, in what way? Organising your code into modules, and then accessing them, is very similar to how classes are organised and accessed. The difference is that classes have some OOP advantages - like instantiation. I've thought about what you're thinking before, and no, the extra OOP "boilerplate" code isn't too much.
what is wrong with `setattr()`?
I'm halfway through a Python book and have been really mulling over the first project I attempt. I learn better hands on - but I always start with a read to understand the basics of the language. Simple enough: parsing data to organize it in a way that saves me time in market research (For example: comparing a desirable car's price throughout the nation, sorting used cars by horsepower within a given price range, weighing average price vs mileage, consolidating several used car sources into one page, tracking historical pricing - that sort of thing). The only other idea I have is for work and I'd have to be able to parse information from our CMS - and I'm not so keen on bringing that work home with me. Will use Python server side instead of PHP. Is that common? PHP was really easy for me to learn because I had so many ideas I could get my hands dirty with. It's been difficult to find inspiration with Python for whatever reason. 
Web crawlers are typically set up to run seperately and store their results in a DB that an app would later query.
Text summary stuff is iffy. You can do some pretty great stuff (in comparison with the past) with machine learning but the results will probably disappoint you. Its also not an easy field to get into. There is actually a lot of research into this and some traditional methods work faster, but yeah... So yeah, very difficult. As to getting relevant images... I think it will be very hit and miss and very much depends on how good you can get the text summary and context generation above. You'll need to seperate and identify contexts which is again kind of tricky. The actual searching and pulling of an image is quite easy, but the results will be highly dependent on the contexts you feed it. How competent are you as a programmer? 
I agree. Python has an amazing repository of libraries in a lot of fields so you can dabble a bit. I just wouldn't say jack of all trades though as that implies its competent and practical for that purpose. But yeah, you can definitely dabble in just about everything. 
Yeah so basically do what I said but flatten it as well. You can just chain it in so you don't need an extra line. Could never have guessed that from his question though...

I have a crawler with Flask front-end too. It's simple and quick to write! If you decided to have front end in JS, then just return jsonify(object), and you got a REST api. Just make sure your object and its nested attributes are serializable.

Exactly. `__dict__` also clashes with `@property`. `setattr()` is the way to go.
These days it's pretty much anything I can think of. Having web dev skills means I can build complex websites with relative ease.

Hi there! I would like to recommend you Django. Why ? Well you have the database and the views, also you can separete the results for each user etc... and it's very easy to launch python scripts from the [views.py](https://views.py) I did one scraping app for a client at work and we used Django and the result was pretty nice. When you want to print the results form the database it's very easy as well since you can create a loop to print the data in the tables. Also you could have in mind DataTables, jquery library for frontend that allows you to filter arround the data with the front end and you can also export the data in csv, pdf and others. I hope this helps you out.
At the risk of being downvotes back to 1994, don’t rule out PHP (v7). I’ve written a ton of apps with this format, typically a standalone script/service (use python here) always running and “managing” a database where the scrapes data is stored. You then have a web front-end for querying it as needed. This is where php7, jQuery, and some basic html come into play. I tend to lean towards Bootstrap 4, but use whatever boilerplate package you feel comfortable with.
Correct advise

I laughed _really_ hard at this part of the docs: **Why not attrs?** Attrs does a lot of things very well. SelfishClass does a few things very well. Rarely do I need all of Attr’s functionality.

SelfishClass is less than 1kb. **In the words of the great philosopher Kevin Malone, Me think, why waste time say lot word, when few word do trick.** [I added the emphasis and fixed some typos, otherwise this is a quote from the pypi page]

Yes, everything is passed as reference in python, but some types are immutable, so you only making new ones instead of modifying it. (int str tuples fronzenset are immutable types for example)

As someone in engineering who moved pretty quickly from python 2 to 3 like 5 years ago I have to agree with others that this isn't a problem. Whatever debt of personal code you think you have, the sooner you switch the better. An undergrad student can't have that much technical debt. Early on I was learning so quickly that it was usually more efficient just to start over rather than rewrite that 1000 line thing from last year. I sympathize, but also encourage folks to just pretend python 2 is only there for compatibility and treat it as read only if at all possible. We shouldn't be writing python 2 code now for the same reason people shouldn't have continued writing Fortran 77 code into the 2000's that I have to deal with every day.
Haskell is a little extreme but if you like mental gymnastics and mind bending, it's okay. :)
Are you really talking about classes or modules? Often you don't need classes, modules have their own namespace in which variables and functions are encapsulated. You only need classes if you need to instantiate multiple objects from them. 
Yes, calculate the value of gradient desent and after find value of constant. Once u have those values, you can predict values on based on ur input though they are out of data set
As the website needs login, I think u need to pass cookies along with header which u sent with request.

If it's a script, there may not be a need for OOP, but modules and functions which transform data. Does you script simulate processes which need to keep track of internal state or it just transform data? 
I thought someone had posted this here, but must have been another recent similar thread, as I can't find it. [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AEJHKGk9ns) video from pycon 2015 makes it *very* clear.
In that case what you want to do is going to be basically impossible for you. You're far too ambitious. I get that you basically want to create a magic summary creating device to make studying less effort but you're going to spend so much time trying to build this and will be so disappointed with the result that you're better off just investing the time in your studies. One thing I forgot to mention is that text summary and such is designed to be at a 5th grade reading level so it falls apart really quickly for technical stuff. It's known as the newspaper level. So yeah....

I was joking, but why is Jython so bad? What are some major pain points compared to CPython?
Definitely post it here when you do. I would also be interested in contributing.
I don't think I understand your code (it looks like you are putting an 'overlay' on all pages of the original document). But if you are trying to 'cover' the whole page, why not just remove it and replace with a blank page? BTW: How do you know which pages need to be screened? Are you always removing the same page (for example page 3)?
I am indeed overlaying every page. This overlay document is designed for these pdfs (unique first page then cover a column in every other page). I'm only try to cover a part of each page. Also, all of the pages need to be screened. Thanks for your help and let me know if you have any advice! 
Still new to coding so asking out of curiosity - would forms do this trick for as well without having to set up an API endpoint?
Fair enough.
It's not actively developed, and there's not much demand other traction around it. Also, Graal supports(alpha, though) Python 3.7, so I don't see any reason to use outdated and not actively developed piece of tech.
They both accomplish the same thing under the hood. So yep!
I am not sure what you mean by forms. Since the web runs on js, if you want this website to run the code in users machine, it wouldn't be possible. You would have to code your crawler in js. How you solve this problem is create an API using flask and host your python code in your server. Whenever user fills in details and creates a request, it sends these variables to your python code in the api and does the required crawling. You can then have another api endpoint to check progress and return the data once crawling is done since I assume crawling is not something that is completed very fast and a http request may timeout. Keep in mind in this method if you gets tons of users you will have to make sure your code Is efficient and can handle it, since everyone's crawling tasks will be running on your server.

I would actually just use `subprocess` to run ImageMagick's `convert` command.
What /u/zenic told you is not quite correct. Python does not treat different types differently; all types are passed in exactly the same way. Python never uses either pass by reference or pass by value. The difference that you're seeing is due to the difference between two types of "change"; _mutation_ and _rebinding_. In your example you are mutating the list and rebinding the int. You can see the effects of mutations anywhere that you have access to the value involved, but rebindings only affect the scope where they happen. I strongly recommend you watch Ned Batchelder's talk that was linked to by /u/timbledum. That will give you an accurate idea of what's going on.
You could possibly create a queue that is shared between the threads. Regarding the bottleneck that you are trying to fix is not writing to the database then this should do the trick. Create a separate thread from your other threads that handles this queue to write data to the sqlite3 database. This then allows threads to write to the queue and then a specific thread will handle this queue (by writing to the database), meaning no interference.
Got any demos?
This demonstrates how, but as other commenters point out: why?
Im assuming you mean links to downloads. I dont have any demos. Sorry
I don't use python at all. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ But Python 3 is the future, it doesn't matter whether it's as good as 3 or worse, it's EOL and that's that. 
You can also use Tornado for async writes store the data into Redis. 
I don't think thats true because most people programming are searching for specific questions like "How do I change the X label using bokeh" not general terms like Python.
When Django unchained came out, searching for Django related stuff was fun. It still happens sometimes. I was searching for The `Cast` operator from Django ORM recently.
I came across a this Python example but it is a 10 years old post http://code.activestate.com/recipes/526618/ I thought that beofore I dig more into it I should ask around for more recent info, maybe the issue was overcame recently. I can't say I totally understand it, I will need to read the multithreading and the queue Python modules to see how I can apply that to my case I am aclo considering Ansible for running the script in parallel...nost sure how I will handle the DB access in this case
Is it more common to do from a import b, c Or from a import b from a import c ?
not sure how I can apply this...that seems to be an in memory DB (at a quick look) ...I need to store the info for long term
Define long term. You can always generate a report (Looks good for the client too) with all the data in it.
if you ever find a Python port of this https://sourceforge.net/projects/cbsg/ , I'd like to know
As someone who graduated from MATLAB too, don't limit yourself to just using MATLAB like environments. You should use the best editor for the job and I've found python and functions are so much easier to deal with (no separate files per function), I started finding less and less need to use the MATLAB view. Also, once you've started doing machine learning, most of the matrices aren't that useful to insepct.
If the DB is in the memory then I can't reboot or shut down my laptop hence the need to store the data on HDD. Long term..same type of storage as Sqllite...the .db file is stored on my HDD which I can chose to replicate to onedrive or google cloud or whatever
One thing to note is that cuda has incredible documentation and is really easy to use, not to mention is quite ubiquitous. I would argue that your intention of being platform agnostic may create more work than you'll possibly save in flexibility. In your situation, I'd be more than happy to double down on cuda. Also, make sure you look at implementing stuff in cuda to work out what's actually possible to accelerate. If it's something like mcmc, it may not work so well. However if each computation is slow then you might find some benefit.
I wouldn't store such valuable info on a public cloud. But that's up to you. I remembered you can also use asyncio. And you also need SQLite async support. I think that will do the job. 
Built a twitter bot to re-tweet and follow users based on certain hashtags. This was my introduction to Tweepy library. Wrote a script to extract 2-level deep keyword list from Google Adwords API.
Both are fine. https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#imports
What is your current strategy for writing to your SQLite DB? My first approach would be to structure the code in a way that would allow you to perform all of your network queries first, then write the results to your SQLite db. If it’s organized in this way, you could simply initiate use [Pool.map](https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html#using-a-pool-of-workers) to handle the fetching and consolidation of results into a single iterable which you could then write to your db file. If that won’t work for you, you can look into making your functions asynchronous with asyncio. Here is a third-party library that supports asyncio for SQLite: [aiosqlite](https://github.com/jreese/aiosqlite/blob/master/aiosqlite/core.py)

No, TDD doesn't obviate the need for static types. TDD proves only that when you provide the expected inputs you get the expected outputs. It doesn't allow you to prove anything about *unexpected* inputs (because if you expected them, you'd have written a test case for them). Types guarantee that you'll never have unexpected inputs. A program which passes around unexpected inputs doesn't compile. Period. It's a syntactically invalid program. This is powerful- a test is a separate artifact which makes assertions about how your code behaves, while a statically typed program *makes its own assertions* about how it behaves. Another advantages to strongly typed languages are static analysis. This means better IDE integration- sure, the Python docstring can tell you wat the function takes, but you have to write it, whereas if you use types and clear names, you know exactly what to pass a function, at a glance. Types are a kind of documentation. It means additional proof systems- a static analysis tool can identify bugs or potential bugs right away. I also disagree with your "massive amounts of scaffolding"- while you can go the Spring route and build `BeanFactoryAbstractFactoryBeanGeneratorDecoratorFactory`s, that's more a function of misapplied design patterns than anything inherent in using a strongly typed language. In either case, the goal is to release code without bugs. Types introduce bug-checking *at compile time*. Tests only find bugs at execution time, and only find bugs you knew to look for.
You may also want to have a look at [Django Dynamic Scraper](https://github.com/holgerd77/django-dynamic-scraper) which connects Django Admin with scrapy.
I implemented my first big project, a fully automated and self-managing instagram account. It uses machine learning to identify faces and discard non-faces and then creates an average face for upload. I could use facial alignment to create a realistic looking face, but I'm actually going for an artistic effect so the current method works better. I used crontab to schedule picture generation, upload, commenting, following, etc. www.instagram.com/autofacebot
doing it line by line makes reading diffs easier in the future
I spent this whole summer programming a game in C++, but I was having bizarre issues just displaying a window (it looked like an old television if the width wasn't a multiple of four) or even attempting networking. I almost cried when I remembered Python. It's such a wonderful language, with imaginary numbers, beautiful indentation... :)
After you're done with that, tkinter ftw.
Stallman will be proud of you. https://xkcd.com/225/ https://xkcd.com/344/
Use Wand to be able to convert PDFs to images without getting into the imagemagick cli nonsense. You will need imagemagick of a compatible version (I think it needs to be older than 10.9?), as well as ghostscript. You would need both of those to convert using subprocess+cli anyways, but this way there's no command line popup and no cli syntax to learn. You can use contours from opencv or relative coordinates from the original pdf to determine where in the converted image you need to block out, and then there are tons of tools for drawing an impenetrable security square of sight blocking. (Also opencv tho)
Your example look good, maybe if you're going to have a lot of messages, do the inserts/updates in batches. What I mean, not inserting 1 row but waiting to have 5 or 10 to insert. For Ansible (not an expert in Ansible), I think as long as you exported the db-name and password to environment variables, you shouldn't have much problems.
I started with pycharm and found it to be super helpful and easy to use. 
Don't bother with other IDEs when pycharm is tailored for everything you might want to do. Obviously if you're already comfortable with another editor you might want to stick with it, but if you're open for other options then pycharm community edition is the way to go. 
vscode = G.O.A.T.
If they are network connected why haven't you set an NTP source that will handle all that for you. If they are blocked from Internet get a 'tick' a GPS clock that you run internal as an NTP server. If you have to use Python if the command are CLI use the ssh/telnet tools/modules to login and execute a CLI script you store in a separate text file that you can call as needed.
I havent done much actively in ansible, just used it for some things, but why use ansible for that? Isnt it just used for deployment/configuration? I wouldnt think it is used often after the initial install of an application.
Switched to vscode from pycharm, no disappointments. Nice features, lightweight. G.O.A.T. ✔️
The former 
The value of python is to lock in businesses to force them to hire you?
Yeh, I’ve been using Pycharm for about 1/2 a year. I’m amazed at how much better it has made my code and how much more efficient I am at writing quality code. I was a life-long emacs user so it was hard for me to ever use anything else. Pycharm changed that. I’ve only scratched the surface of the available Pycharm features. I would recommend taking a look at it. 
Atom is too slow. EVERYTHING Atom can do, VSCode already does better. VSCode or PyCharm. Atom is not a legit option for writing serious python code.
The whole beautifulsoup web scraper project is just done for learning and has a low barrier of entrance, which is why so many people recommend it as a project idea. Creating a *generic* webscraper app to automate tasks sites that are JavaScript heavy(ie SAP) especially or when auth and bot-discovery evasion has to be used, the wheels quickly fall off a beautifulsoup stack project. Using scapy for generic scraping would be incredibly educational, but man that is asking for pain. Source: Written and maintained web automation frameworks used for end to end testing for the past 9 years. It is a deceiving deep topic that still has no perfect implementation. 
Nice, sounds like you had a great intro use case to motivate your learning. Now for the opposite, as an analyst who knows python, what is a skillset to improve outside a range of my expertise?
Take a look at plugins, I know for a fact that there's a vim plugin, so maybe an emacs one as well. Lets you have same hotkeys etc. 
Looking longer term/bigger picture: you know their Network better (they don't have to retrain someone), you have shown initiative in developing skills and tools to be more efficient/productive, and, in the long run, creating networking automation scripts with proper configuration management is a gateway to being able to set up and tear down development and test environments quickly (ahem, part of devops). It's also good disaster recovery and site standup skills. Make sure your scripts are available and usable to junior folks. You are going to want to grow past reverse engineering and continue to make yourself useful in new ways. Proper documentation of your own scripts and their output frees you from the shackles of maintenance of your own code and opens up a wider world.
It is not taught in my university or anywhere I know of in the recent years any more. Also in my opinion it is a disservice to the students. Besides as I mentioned there is nothing that a print statement parentheses or an integer division fix cannot handle. Because you cannot teach that much python in undergrad especially in technical disciplines. There is literally zero complaint in the last 3 years overall in my institution.
Right now, it won't matter. Just concentrate on learning to code and worry about this after you know what you're doing, and can tell which tools suit you.
No it's to add value to an employee who can solve problems within his area of expertise in creative and cost effective ways that save the company money while giving visibility to the job the employee did which saved them so much money. It's not a win/lose but a win/win situation for all.
The poster never said anything about locking them in. I think the poster is implying that python was the differentiator in being able to land the FTE position. As my other post hints, there's probably a lot more than just python+Cisco (if they sucked at networking, they probably would not have gotten the job), but being able to show that they can add value to a company was critical to landing the FTE position.
I mainly use PyCharm, though I use Atom for HTML/Javascript/CSS in Flask projects.
Absolutely. I always email the scripts to my team and explain what they do, how they do it and if any show interest I send them the links they can follow to see if Python (or any language) is something they are interested in.
I would use it to leverage existing scripts ....use them with my scripts. To be honest I prefer to solve the multithread multi access problem rather than to move everything to Ansible. Using existing modules would be the only advantage I am seeing for now
How do you edit multiple lines in vscode? In atom I just ctrl+click lines and type. 
I would say that it is the mentality that led you there that they truly find valuable. Saying you know Cisco and Python is just easier to articulate and document for HR and the powers that be. Being able and willing to self teach and apply an unrelated technology to solve a business problem that your organization faced is what adds to your value. Python is an amazing tool to have in the toolbox. I have done numerous projects using it in my career, from aggregating data from multiple sources just because I was too lazy to keep doing it manually all the time to creating vision systems and replacing physics models with machine learning. I have reached a point in my career where I now help younger engineers in the organization try and develop this mentality. When you are exposed to something new always ask yourself “how could I apply this to the problems I face?” Maintaining that attitude will take you far. 
I need to save the data as soon as I get it because I am often running in situation when the output is not consistent (different OS code running on the devices from the same manufacturer) and then my program might crash or stop and I loose the data previously collected if I do not save it
You should look at using git, svn, or another configuration management tool that your new employer provides so that you can move past emailing versions of scripts around. Drop a markdown file with the instructions and revision notes in the root of the repo and you can reduce the time you spend with distribution, and build another valuable skill!
Scripts via email? Why aren't you using version control for this? Serious question, maybe there's something about Fortune 100 companies I don't know yet. :)
Wireshark/pcap (or now npcap). How the App talks over the network is the key to solving so many problems. Did the request make it. Is there a proper TCP handshake? Did the server respond properly? Did packets get lost on the wire? Is there to much latency due to excessive 'turns'? (A turn is a change in direction of the flow of packets. So client -&gt; server....server -&gt; client...client -&gt; server = 3 turns) on a LAN this may be measured in nanoseconds whereas on a WAN it could be ms or worse. To many high latency turns on a WAN App can cause timeouts and re-sends. This specific example usually results is the standard (it's the network, it't the app) finger pointing when really it's both and together the two sides could solve it. If you can help a network engineer who can't do this troubleshooting you are a step ahead. And of course Python has awesome wireshark support modules. :)
hahhah cause I am a noob! I just started my git man!! hahaha \*hangs head in shame\* yes git is better than email.
It was more 'I didn't know'. Remember Networking doesn't use git. It uses more of a Configuration Management tool. Similar idea but totally different platform/process.
I see, thank you! The company I work for introduced 'infrastructure as code', which makes using version control for network management possible too. Maybe that's something you could look into, as it's getting more and more useful with cloud computing and Infrastructure as a Service.
It should work in vs code too. I use cmd + click on my mac.
I will google the term and thank you!
I had faced a similar situation with fetching Data from APIs while multitheading and storing the data without any lock or loss. MongoDB provided the best solution. Just jsonify your response data and dump it into a single document. MongoDB handles the parallelism really well. It pretty much plug and play. However it's would be heavier than SQL lite , but maybe give it a shot.
Bingo! A lot of software engineers understand that interfaces are the hard part. Not just user interfaces, but any interfaces. Where the main code calls outside libraries. Where you read the data from the hardware. Where you have to talk to the network. Etc. This is true in the real world as well. Crevices between specialties are often not bridged well. You've found one between "coder" and "network engineer". I found one where I work between software engineer and person who understands the problem domain(s) we work with. Because these are interfaces, they are hard problems. Because you are solving it, you are valuable. I recently (also using Python, but that's kind of a coincidence) significantly became more valuable to the Big Bosses as well for very similar reasons.
Atom is not IDE. Atom is text editor.
Depends what are you going to learn - IDE/editor configuration or learning Python. If you just started, use any text editor you already comfortable with. When I started to learn Python I have no idea about IDEs or which text editor to use (that time a was not able to quit from vim), so I've just fire IDLE and start hacking.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv25Dwe84g0 You can send your results to a queue and use the queue to do whatever it is you want with them, like write to the SQLite DB. &gt;without having problems with the DB connection Leave the connection open until the script is finished and then close it. This way you queue manager can udpate the db without having to connect/disconnect repeatedly.
And hopefully you made a nice donation to the the [Python Software Foundation](https://www.python.org/psf/).
VIM + addons to make it an IDE
yes! thank you
Default is alt+click in vs code I think.
&gt; call it from your environment? don't think that's possible
I use atom now... frankly it’s slow to start, but after that it runs smooth as a dream. Kinda regretful there isn’t an easy way to run scripts or compile programs, but for python just keeping a terminal open on the side is enough.
If you say that, someone will ask you to define the difference, and you will not be able to, apart from "because I say it is" which isn't how engineering works.
I had started teaching myself python a few years ago after sitting in a couple of devnet classes. I'm by no means a developer, but I have a nice skillset add-on. Last year I had to deploy a SD-wan solution and I got to use python and flask to make an app for field engineers to see the status of the devices they we're deploying using the built in APIs.
You can write scripts that other people can use, then you make a lot more money as it gives more values to the current company. You will probably have to negotiate first with your director though.
It's also good for tracking changes and bugs. You can go back to old versions of code and better understand what changes you have made between versions.
Why not use a data class, or regular attributes? Must be some highly dynamic code. What about the entity-component design pattern from gamedev?
Goddamn dude. I don not expect anyone to e-mail code to people, let alone a professional developer emailing code to his team.
I'm aware of CuPy; it's actually one of the libraries that inspired this question in the first place. But again, no OpenCL support, so it doesn't interest me all that much. You're right that CUDA tends to dominate GPGPU tasks, but I don't see that as a good reason to use it; popular!=better. The only thing that makes CUDA especially better is Nvidia's devotion to it, where they made it a little bit easier to get into. After all, Nvidia directly supports CuPy. But, since I'm seeking a pre-made library (or at least working instructions on how to use Numpy in OpenCL), that advantage becomes irrelevant. Anyway, I already know for a fact that T-API makes a pretty hefty performance difference on the hardware I'm using. Like I said in my OP, I'm handling high resolutions (like 1080p@30FPS) so I'm not going to be doing iterative tasks.
Congratulations! My story is similar, though it predates yours by about 20 years. I was introduced to Python in 1999 by a coworker for use on an embedded flight controls system. We ended up using Python as our primary test interface; we built up two interfaces, one within the flight controls software using C++ and one that could run on a standard pc in python. Interface protocol, as I recall, was simply built up on top of TCP. But I knew immediately that I would rather use Python than C or C++ due to all of the pain points those two languages have and Python generally solves. Fast forward about 12 years and I finally was able to land a job doing Python full time. But I was using Python for those 12 years whereever I could. Today I use Python developing cloud based services. But it's actually useful in all of these: embedded software development, orchestration, network management, game development, cloud services, big data, etc.
Trying to do p2p audio calls between 2 (and more?) raspberry pi zeros. First failed attempt was to use webrtc. Wrote a python wrapper to it, using pypuppeteer. Ran like a charm on my PC. But after finally getting chromium to work on the raspberry pi zero, I discover that chromium takes goddamn 60-80% cpu, which well is just I'm not willing to accept. So the next try will be to try to use [p2p-sip](https://github.com/theintencity/p2p-sip).
So what IDE do you use? Notepad++?
There's a way. Look for a Run Script package. I used it all the time before I switched to VS code and Sublime 
I'm handling a 3-layer array, where the secondary array is guaranteed to be in the quadruple-digits. Through T-API, OpenCV is using OpenCL to basically perform Numpy calculations, and it makes a noticeable difference. This is despite the PCIe overhead. I'm basically just doing another two Numpy calculations using the same data. So, as far as I'm concerned, it is perfectly reasonable that I will see a difference. I get the impression Numba's CUDA support is pretty complete, though, the documentation could use some work. What's not so complete is their non-CUDA support. If I were to use Numba, I'd hope that I could switch away from CUDA if I need to.
Lol my company flagged my email the very first time I tried to do that, never did that since then. I send a link to the script as a download with a flask sever that is hosting from my computer. We don't have git, and tfs is not something I want to deal with.
I'm really happy that this complexity is staying away from the python langugage. 
That sounds like a case for a good old try/except clause. If you see a consistent type of exception, you should capture it with that clause and log it for debugging purposes. Then your script can continue processing un-interrupted.
100% on the documentation. Your value is as an innovator who provides magical power upgrades to as many as possible, not as that one guy who made that one script that we need to keep him around for.
There is a big difference that can be easily described. IDE is an integrated development environment, meaning it has the ability to help you develop your program, which is more than let you write it. It would have stuff like a built in console, ability to manage your environment set up, the ability to detect mistakes in your imports and the ability to tell you what kind of parameters each function expects, etc. For example, pycharm has tools to help you manage your venvs, install packages and a run button that you can click to run the script and you would see the result in Pycharm. Atom is a text editor, designed specifically for code it is true, but it has none of the tools required to actually run the code. It just helps you edit the text. If I write a function call with two parameters while the function require 3, it won’t point that out. 
Great! Thanks! I've switched from atom to vs code but I missed that option. I'm not coding that much and I mainly use vim for shell scripts. 
I guess I could do that but I feel safe if I save Besides that the script is recurrent at some points it needs that data already discovered and I did not know if I should keep it in memory what would be the requirements-I am still new to programming :-) and I do it on and off, it is a tool for me
I am using the same DB for multiple scripts, one of them is recurrent and it needs to go back to the DB to query for info previously discovered ...this one won't get multithreading ( I am walking an unknown tree practically) 
Well, you could use git from within TFS. :D Then again: I'm _very_ thankful to work in a company that is not as invested in Microsoft technologies. Although we use the good parts in production (read: some parts of Azure).
I am a network engineer and have done this several times. You can use worker processes to generate data which all send output to a python multiprocessing queue with one worker reading the queue and writing to the SQLite DB. It is not unreasonable to get to ~5000 rows writes per second. Disk IO is a major limiting factor. The only major problem I ran into is if the worker nodes generated data faster than the writes happened. Queues essentially cache data in memory, depending on the size of your data, you might run out of memory. On a related note, SQLAlchemy is awesome.
dat telemetry data tho
Nah, don't sweat it out man. even the team that create git [still use email](https://lwn.net/Articles/702177/) via wrapper to manage pathces because that's more comfortable for them. Granted, the main source code is in git. So there's a single source of truth.
You can persist Redis to disk. By default, it's memory only.
Lol I wish our company would move into azure that would even help for some of my needs. I'm the only python/java dev in my dept, if I did not have a good compensation I'd look for a new job.
Atom and VS code have all the functionality you've described. You just need to install plugins. I use both PyCharm and VS code, you can easily replicate 90% of the features of PyCharm.
[Just turn it off](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/supporting/FAQ#_gdpr-and-vs-code) ["telemetry.enableTelemetry": false](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/supporting/faq#_how-to-disable-telemetry-reporting) Easy peasy
I used to use Atom! It's really not that bad. You can install pylint, use snippets, search with regex, and it has most things you need. Atom's out of the box syntax highlighting for python is also great! Nowadays I use Vim with a ton of python configs, and I love it. I've never tried pycharm because I could never get over the licensing. In vim though you can use tons of linters, type hints, vim keybinds, airline, etc. I love vim. 
The key word here is “integrated”, you install pycharm and get all that. When you modify Atom by plugins you are basically building your own IDE from components. You can also get the same functionality with notepad and a terminal window. But the whole point of IDE is to have a ready and easy solution right out of the box. I currently use Atom for Node and used pycharm for python. I know I can use Atom for both but why bother modifying Atom to match Pycharm if I can just use Pycharm. 
Great to hear, well done! I always tell my students not to be afraid to code themselves out of a job - you usually end up better off as a result.
 &gt; Make sure your scripts are available and usable to junior folks. Absolutely. This is where I see most NetEng types fall (including myself for most of my career.) It was more about multiplexing yourself then building a system that could be used by someone else. I recorded a podcast with the Packet Pushers about this, that should be coming out in 2 weeks, if anyone is interested. 
I don't get that volume of that simply because I have a jumpbox between me and my devices I am using the sqlite3 module which I must admit does not look that pythonic. I decided to use this 4 years ago when my programming skills were different. I might look at changing to SQLAlchemy in the future
SQLAchemy just makes schema and query management easier. It will not make it faster. SQLAchemy does have some bulk insert methods that get near native speeds.
I tried it, but it just felt unnatural. In other IDEs it’s much simpler to run scripts and this is something atom needs work on. I’ve now just kinda grown used to a ⌘ prompt.
A good way to check if something is the same object is using the `.id` attribute on python objects. It's a great debugging tool. print() is programmer's best friend :)
Always keep in mind that there's more to a job than the current salary. Besides quality of life, you should think of your professional advancement: If your company is behind in the technology stack and there's no one you can learn from in terms of Java and Python, you're likely to loose on that side. :/
You probably don’t need classes or separate files. Use classes to a.) describe data (eg the classic x,y point class) or b.) make easily overrides behavior (ie the base class does A B C but you can inherit and override B while keeping A and C). In most cases, you’re better off just writing a series of short, clear functions. As for files, you don’t need to split for each class. That’s a weird Java thing. 
Charles Leifer wrote about this on his blog. http://charlesleifer.com/blog/multi-threaded-sqlite-without-the-operationalerrors/ While he ends up implementing it inside peewee (which I happen to like) he talks about the fundamentals of it.
I am to blame for [this one](https://code.activestate.com/recipes/577988-funny-text-generator/?in=user-1552957) 
The way I would like to utilize OOP is to make it extensible and easier to read for contributors or additions going forward. It is a single script, but that is as a POC. For instance, I have some networking pieces for multiple devices to find eachother. However I want that to be modular and controllable on it's own. So, you can kick off a 're-scan' of hosts manually. Regarding the data, everything this tool gathers is pushed to a DB. I'd like that to be modular as well, so a user could throw an API call to manually get data at a time where the original script wouldn't have gathered it. I also like the idea of using modular classes which can be re-imported on failure (also manually). Overall it sounds like I should just be created modules instead of imported classes though - Right? I guess either way would work I'd just like to get the best practice down before having to redo it again later on.
&gt; don't need classes, modules h It is sounding like I just need modules actually.
&gt; The key word here is “integrated”, you install pycharm and get all that. However the appropriate plugins are installed, it is an integrated development environment (the dev tools are now integrated in with the editing tools). If you called say a plain text editor like `nano` or Microsoft Notepad an IDE that would be a stretch (even if it shares some basic features like syntax highlighting) as they generally aren't configurable to include advanced IDE features. But something like atom or [emacs](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63421/using-emacs-as-an-ide) or [vim](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9959215/vim-as-an-ide-suggestions)) when configured properly they essentially are integrated development environments.
well in the Boston area it seems like age 32 is now considered 'old'. I have heard from others not to bother wasting your time trying to change careers to be a developer or programmer if you are in your 30s, this is actually for most careers.. You are going to look pretty weird going back to school or being in a classroom with people 10 years or more your junior as well as competing with them for junior level positions where the employer will likely hire a just out of school 20 something who will 'fit in' 
Sure, it's much better to be a replacable cog that noone knows about or cares about.
I can install billions of plugins in vim to replicate pycharm but that won't make it an IDE.
Oh noes, Microsoft will steal your shitty script.
Wondering, is all of your knowledge from certifications and experience or did you get a degree in networking or something related?
Great that's awesome! Regarding multiprocessing, I am just looking to have these modules run certain functions in parallel while parsing out the responses. Still looking at what makes sense. Maybe MP is too much and I have implemented other parallel functionality (threading and asyncio). Right now I'm using asyncio on the single script's functions which is cool to handle it in a way... I'm doing a lot of research on Python right now :P Which is why I thought - Why not use MP module instead!? Thanks for helping out!
&gt; files, you don’t need to split for each cla Thanks for the info!
Sure if you under 30 and just a 'few' (but not too many) years out of college and of course either white or Asian -- hiring managers will never admit this but this is the "ideal candidate" in the "new economy" of the 2010s where hiring is based not on qualifications but age (preferably under 35, white or asian and have high "EQ" (not IQ but EQ). 
No. It's better to have an actual skill and be so good at it that other people just don't compare.
Pycharm community edition is great, 99% of people don’t need to pay for a license IMO
That's what he did. He's so good, that other people, like me or you, just don't compare.
git is a bit hard to learn but it is leaps and bounds better than other version control systems I've used in the past (CVS, SVN, clearcase). git related tools I use every day: * gitk (GUI view of git history) * magit (really good emacs git integration) Some git tips for newbies: * making a new branch is cheap. Any time you want to make a "bookmark" simply drop a branch When you foresee working with others on git you must learn about * git rebase * git rebase -i // squash all your tiny commits into a few larger commits * [git merge -no-ff](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)
This is just pointless arguing over semantics. 
&gt; An undergrad student can't have that much technical debt. That *very heavily* depends on what they are doing. &gt; I sympathize, but also encourage folks to just pretend python 2 is only there for compatibility and treat it as read only if at all possible. We shouldn't be writing python 2 code now for the same reason people shouldn't have continued writing Fortran 77 code into the 2000's that I have to deal with every day. Yeah, we shouldn't. But unfortunately universities refuse to upgrade.
Is a car without fuel still a car?
&gt; It is not taught in my university or anywhere I know of in the recent years any more. Also in my opinion it is a disservice to the students. The university I went to, as well as the universities 6/7 of my friends wemt to, still teach Py2. It *is* a disservice to the students. But it still *happens*. &gt; Besides as I mentioned there is nothing that a print statement parentheses or an integer division fix cannot handle. Because you cannot teach that much python in undergrad especially in technical disciplines. There is literally zero complaint in the last 3 years overall in my institution. This heavily depends on the projects being done. Some people don't have technical debt, others have 43 side projects and 17 educational but has non educational capabilities projects.
This is similar to what I'm going through right now. We just lost the guy that does a lot of the scripting for our team, so I'm stepping up and converting all his old code into powershell and writing all the new code in python. I'm the only person on my team that knows python, powershell and sql (BI Team) and it is nice in that I'm more valuable to the company (new boss has mentioned it), but its frustrating that I don't get any help when projects start piling up. 
Create a random number between any two numbers!
No he actively implemented python in a company that doesn't have anyone that can maintain it. At best that's careless at worst malevolent.
Once it's all installed, it's identical. As I said to someone else, if I put seats and windows into a van, it is not now a minibus and the same as a purpose built minibus?
personally I use Sublime, super fast and reliable.
&gt; If I put seats and windows into a van, is not now a minibus? If I put seats and windows into a wheelcart, is it now a minibus?
isn't the purpose of Ansible not something completely different? well, if it works, it works..., but not in all cases, if there are actually tools to do something imo
&gt; No he actively implemented python in a company that doesn't have anyone that can maintain it. He's the one who can maintain it.
[removed]
If you add an engine to a wheelcart, sure's it car. With with extra seats and windows for sufficient people, sure it qualifies as a mininbus.
I just finished a simple text editor. I am trying to create a system which saves variables in a text file, and can later read them. I will use this to make a simple text based rpg where stats will actually be saved so you can continue.
When plugins and software are so easy to install we don't really count them being missing as significant. For example if you were told to go out and buy a word processing machine, and you came back with a regular computer without an office suite, saying you could download an office suite, no-one's really going to care.
&gt; The value of python is to lock in businesses to force them to hire you? Which is my original point.
Good for you. Where is it? 
Pycharm.
I write lots of python scripts that have to run against thousands of devices. I decide that is better not to deal with multithreading/multiprocessing. Instead a write a simpler script and use xargs/parallel to run multiple process. I found out I'm much more productive this way.

I've never used tkinter. I've heard it doesn't support audio/pictures. It's just a bare bones GUI. How would you go about adding those? I'm not trying to create Metro 2020, but I'd like my game to have sprites and/or basic sounds/music.
I don't have any data to back this up, but I believe MoinMoin is the most common python wiki engine because I've never heard of anyone using anything else. Personally I would recommend wiki engines based on hosting cost and the features available to end users e.g. WYSIWYG editor plugins, automatic translation, etc. Sadly, mediawiki is hard to beat here because of wikipedia.
Nice &lt;3 Thanks for this
I also have to add [yodaspeak](http://www.yodaspeak.co.uk/webservice/yodatalk.php?wsdl) You'll need a soup library but not zeep because is not working. I used [suds-jurko](https://bitbucket.org/jurko/suds) which is a updated suds version for python 3.x. If someone nees the code: `yoda_url = 'http://www.yodaspeak.co.uk/webservice/yodatalk.php?wsdl'` `client = Client(yoda_url)` `yodish = client.service.yodaTalk("Your text here")` `print("yodish")`
No idea of how tweepy works but as far as I know twitter polls are not available through the API. So I guess the answer is no.
I would totally jump on the mediawiki bandwagon, but unfortunately my raging fanaticism for Python prevents me from using based on PHP.
The projects are creatively thought out. I did the books exercise and it spawned multiple other fun practice projects from them. Great book and series of books!
I usually just make sprites as an array of numbers...
Is made by you? If yes there is any python library I can download with pip? I don't want to copy paste the code \^\^
If you're new to programming, then you want less things to worry about, i.e. a basic text editor that 1) won't stand in your way 2) won't help you too much In that case, any text editor will do. Notepad++ on windows. Sublime Text (all platforms). Good luck 
Hi Raining i trying to use the app look at what am getting: **File ".\\**[**whipFTP.py**](https://whipFTP.py)**", line 1190, in &lt;module&gt;** **root.tk.eval('package require tkdnd')** and this too **tkinter.TclError: couldn't load library "C:\\Users\\Benjamin\\whipftp\_4.1\_windows\\whipftp\_4.1\\TkDND/libtkdn** **d2.8.dll": Bad exe format. Possibly a 32/64-bit mismatch.** Please any thought. Thanks
If you're in a "Fortune 100", somewhere there should have devs team. They should have something already setup for versioning and access to source code. (GitLab, etc) Find the team responsible for that, make the networking team have their access to that, and create repos. I'm sure the devs we'll be happy to help.
32 bit windows or 64 bit windows?
Rewriting a Raspberry Pi based photobooth system written in Python, previously it was all functions with some in different files but it was a bit of a hack to get it working to a deadline for a party. Now trying to rewrite using classes and functions inside the classes, I'm not too sure when is appropriate to break out into a new class or when to put things in different files though.
64 bit Windows! 
You could switch to another database such as PostgreSQL. That will let you have a connection for each worker. I find multiprocessing/threading super difficult, especially when processes have to communicate, so I try to minimise that by making each worker as independent as possible. You'll need a postgresql database running on your laptop. This takes very little resources. You'll also need psycopg2 to handle the python to database interaction. See: http://initd.org/psycopg/docs/usage.html for a basic example. If you're new to databases I'd wait with SQLAlchemy until you have a grasp of what you're doing. If your workers only really do an insert to store the data it might be overkill. If you want to go all fancy you could even write this up with Docker. A Docker compose could bring up your database and start the application for you. Making it easier to move the script off your laptop and onto a more permanent server if you want to in the future. 
And it isn’t verbose to write “this” everywhere? 
Why would the word "this" be superior to the word "self"? There has to be *some* word to access the scope...
[Why must ‘self’ be used explicitly in method definitions and calls?](https://docs.python.org/3/faq/design.html#why-must-self-be-used-explicitly-in-method-definitions-and-calls)
Suppose you could readily adapt something like this with mezzanine (I've been learning it recently because I don't want to use php either)
You can use `this` instead of you like ^(but please don't)
Which python version?
bump
Adding self as a method parameter is something I profoundly dislike.

A small Discord bot for my guild members of a game I play.
I haven't looked at that book. A good beginner's book, however, is Think Python. It's free (legally), and is written by a professor with a long experience in teaching CS (just google Think Python. 2nd edition uses Python 3.0) 
Both. Degree in engineering.
ah yes...there are many engineering degrees though, which one? And can you recommend 2-3 certs for those that would be new to this field? I don't know that I want a job in this area so much as I have a hunger for more knowledge around it. 
I always suggest people specialize. Python programmers are easy to find, python programmers who are experts at &lt;thing&gt; never are (well, maybe besides web dev but always surprising how all the web devs are employed when you're looking).
What does pycharm do better than VS Code? 
unfortunately there are no implementations of Numpy on OpenCL. as mentioned by others there is already pyopencl but not as mature and complete as np. there is also some porting of pytorch for OCL, which kind of np for GPGPU. there are however some OCL implementations of linear algebra APIs BLAS/LAPACK: [CLBlast](https://github.com/CNugteren/CLBlast), [clBLAS](https://github.com/clMathLibraries/clBLAS), [clMAGMA](http://icl.cs.utk.edu/magma/software/view.html?id=190), [ArrayFire](https://arrayfire.com/) and [ViennaCL](http://viennacl.sourceforge.net/), to mention some. Also take a lock at AMDs ROCm attempts. they have ported many of the popular libraries, including pytorch as far as I know. maybe if you ask for numpy porting it will push them to do something. 
Damn as a Cisco guy, this makes the value of python that much stronger for me. Currently learning Python.
Why? I like it because its explicit. But...it seems like a weird hill to die on either way.
I'd have to check out vscode's features to give a fair comparison because I never used it, but what pycharm does excellently is that it supports python's virtualenvs, has template projects for most popular web frameworks, displays tips for code style out of the box and does some static type checks during write-time. I believe that vscode might have those features either by default or by plugins, but things pycharm does without the need to configure it or install plugins are simply magical. If vscode by default has at least those, then I'm all in for using it as well. 
&gt;No, TDD doesn't obviate the need for static types. TDD proves only that &gt;when you provide the expected inputs you get the expected outputs. It &gt;doesn't allow you to prove anything about unexpected inputs (because if &gt;you expected them, you'd have written a test case for them). I disagree, and Uncle Bob disagrees.A test verifies that outputs are correct. If your outputs are correct, nothing is going to get unexpected inputs (except at the edges via I/O, which is always going to need to be tested at runtime). Your math function isn't suddenly going to output "ostrich". Anyway, to quote Robert C. Martin: &gt; I've been a statically typed bigot for quite a few years. I learned my lesson &gt;the hard way while using C. Too many systems crashed in the field due to &gt;silly typing errors. When C++ came out, I was an avid adopter, and rabid &gt;enforcer of strong typing. I scoffed at the smalltalkers who whined about &gt;the loss of flexibility. Safety, after all, was far more important than &gt;flexibility -- and besides, we can keep our software flexible AND statically &gt;typed, if we just follow good dependency management principles. &gt; &gt;...About two years ago I noticed something. I was depending less and &gt;less on the type system for safety. My unit tests were preventing me from &gt;making type errors. The more I depended upon the unit tests, the less I &gt;depended upon the type safety of Java or C++ (my languages of choice). &gt; &gt;I thought an experiment was in order. So I tried writing some applications &gt;in Python, and then Ruby (well known dynamically typed languages). I &gt;was not entirely surprised when I found that type issues simply never &gt;arose. My unit tests kept my code on the straight and narrow. I simply &gt;didn't need the static type checking that I had depended upon for so many &gt;years. &gt; &gt;I also realized that the flexibility of dynamically typed langauges makes &gt;writing code significantly easier. Modules are easier to write, and easier to &gt;change. There are no build time issues at all. Life in a dynamically typed &gt;world is fundamentally simpler. &gt; &gt;Now I am back programming in Java because the projects I'm working on &gt;call for it. But I can't deny that I feel the tug of the dynamically typed &gt;languages. I wish I was programming in Ruby or Python, or even &gt;Smalltalk. Martin is a co-author of the Agile Manifesto, SOLID principles, etc. Bruce Eckel has written similarly of being a convert to the benefits of dynamic typing. &gt;Types guarantee that you'll never have unexpected inputs. No they don't. They might check if a value is an integer, but they won't guarantee that the value is less that 10 or that the integer passed in parameter A is greater than the integer passed into parameter B. You still have to write tests for these types of instances, which incidentally also catch type errors. If your function should output 5 and it outputs 2, a test fails. If it outputs "opossum", it still fails. Meanwhile, you have to write code to convince a compiler that a type is safe, meaning the machine is the boss of you. And as is said, every line of code doesn't need to be written is a line of code guaranteed to be bug free. Then there's the vast scaffolding to try to get pretend dynamic typing - generics, interfaces, class hierarchies, etc., etc., etc. It's pure madness to catch simplistic errors that can be fixed in moments and should be caught by test-driven development anyway. &gt; A program which &gt;passes around unexpected inputs doesn't compile. Period. A program with tests doesn't produce unexpected outputs that become another function's unexpected inputs. Period. &gt;a static analysis tool can identify bugs or potential bugs right away. As Bruce Eckel said, he's come to realize it doesn't matter when a bug is caught, only that it's caught. &gt;I also disagree with your "massive amounts of scaffolding"- while you can &gt;go the Spring route and build &gt;BeanFactoryAbstractFactoryBeanGeneratorDecoratorFactorys, that's &gt;more a function of misapplied design patterns than anything inherent in &gt;using a strongly typed language. Generics, templates, interfaces, etc., etc. - it's all still there and it results in massive complexities compared to dynamic typing. &gt;Types introduce bug-checking at compile time. Tests only find bugs at &gt;execution time In modern development (continuous integration), you check in code and it automatically gets compiled and all the tests are run on it, whether we're talking python or C++. &gt; and only find bugs you knew to look for. And types find only trivial bugs that are seldom made and instantly diagnosed and fixed. No one lies awake at night worrying about those; they worry about subtle logic errors, and typing doesn't do a dang thing about hard-to-find or fix bugs. 
Hey! I recently wrote a paper on how to automate a network setup by using a python script and wrote a GUI program using python that requested simple info from a user so that a noob could set up a network for a LAN-party. Just simple stuff like DHCP, EtherChannel, VLANs, etc. It all worked great and I achieved my goal. So someone with no knowledge of how to set up a Cisco network could set up a network from 10 to 2000 users using only the script. I used Netmiko for SSH connection and Tkinter for the GUI. There is no real reason for me to tell you this, but I found it incredibly interesting and it excites me that you also are doing it. If you have any aspects of your scripts that especially excite you, than I'd love to hear about it. And if you have any questions about mine, I'd love to answer. For some reason I really enjoy both Python and Cisco.
but why do you want to do a rebase? why not just a merge? 
Are we calling it a coding language now? What next? Computer Science becomes Coding Science?
Wow, the very next paragraph is "Why can't i use an assignment in an expression?"
I think he's asking why it's explicitly required. Java, for example, assumes an implicit this if you reference an identifier in a method and the class has that identifier.
No, pip would be overkill for such a small module.

This was super helpful. I've just started using sphinx to generate docs for a library that I'm working on. I've also developed a great respect for those that document matplotlib.
Fair enough. You're right that pycharm is more batteries-included. VS code is definitely more light-weight though, so there is the trade-off.
Why is it terrible? The numeric ABCs have Integral as a subtype of Real. 
 Ccna and python guy right here. How do I leverage this?
OOP and multiprocessing are not mutually exclusive. OOP is just a means to organise and express code.
No PYPY, but isn't the framework a small part of the whole app ? So you kinda need pypy ? No gevent. Even though asyncio is the futuere, IT SUCKS (sometimes truth hurts). 
Rebasing is helpful for maintaining a cleaner history. Instead of having multiple forked branches that collapse back to one again from merging, it linearizes your history. Some good comparisons here: https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/merging-vs-rebasing Rabasing can also help alleviate confusion between the different types of merges (i.e., fast-forward vs. three-way). See for e.g.: https://stackoverflow.com/a/28407540/5087436
Only he first chapter is free. He others will be scrambled.
Very impressive project. Feedback: * [Feedback talks for itself](https://vibora.io/) - "talks" should be "speaks" * [Freezing environments via Docker is sexy](https://docs.vibora.io/deploy) - very promising framework I would say. * Some session examples in the docs would be nice. * A link to some documentation about "network flow control" issues would be nice [here](https://docs.vibora.io/faq#where-is-japronto-on-benchmarks). I'm nowhere sophisticated enough to work on this code, but I just submitted some [grammar and typo fixes](https://github.com/vibora-io/vibora/pull/173). 
One of my successes was to use Netmiko to do a basic write mem of 1600 nodes. I didn't get a tkinter GUi working (tried but not enough time). So building the GUI parts are next for me so anyone can do it. 
The same can be said for `merge --squash` - you end up with one new commit for everything committed in the branch.
did now.
This is the fourth fucking repost of this github page in less than 2 days.
I just started Python two months ago but I’ve been writing scripts everyday. I want to create a text editor this week where files can be saved and opened with a .txt extension.
That's changing in 3.8 right?
Afaik C++ too.
Indeed, squashing is nice! But really kinda depends on how big the branches are.
Hi, Try installing wmi with pip? Open the commandline you use python with and try pip install wmi If that doesn't work, try python -mpip install wmi 
I'll have to check it out. I need something which will update an eink display every minute on the minute
Because explicit is better than implicit. 
&gt; plugins are available and easy to install &gt; integrated Pick one.
Whoa I didn't know about the Wireshark modules. Thank you!
What `.id` attribute on which object are you referring to?
Good stuff. I hacked around a Kafka wrapper but it's not too robust. I'll check out your implementation!
Perhaps check out https://github.com/HyperionGray/starbelly May be of help!
What are some go-to modules for you for your use cases?
&gt; very fast Participate in https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/ &gt; Python It's mostly Cython, isn't it?
I would suggest to try LMDB (python-lmdb) for the database storage. It is a key-value database store based on memory-mapped files, and supports multiple threads, and it is very fast and used in infrastructure software like openldap and postfix. Also, it sounds like your problem is I/O bound. Based on that, I'd suggest to try to use gevent, which uses asynchronous event processing, without multithreading. This matches Python better because there is always only one running Python thread because of the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL). It is also more efficient than multi-threading because no context switches are required. 
Well, Microsoft acquired github recently .....
Yeah, PostreSQL is great for this. Multi-threading is indeed difficult, I have experimented a lot with Clojure and it makes tasks like that much simpler (but it's quite mind-bending at first). It might be easier to use gevent in Python, which manages green threads which work for I/O but use only one Python thread - normally no locking required. 
They're basically the same for software.
This looks amazing at a first glance. I'll definitely have to play around with it. How painful would migrating an existing Flask app would be, I wonder? Also, from the docs it seems like all routing is done via function decoration ATM. I may be a maintainability zealot here, but I consider class-based views to be a non-negotiable feature for anything that would be used in a larger/long-term project. Now you could easily hack that together for the purposes of your own app, but it'll probably wind up being a major pain point for multi-app projects and plugin development down the line, with a billion disparate interfaces to handle.
Plone is a CMS, but it has wiki addons and features. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zwiki https://quintagroup.com/cms/plone/wiki https://github.com/collective/collective.simplewiki 
I would query overpass-turbo instead! 
notepadd++ isn't an IDE, it is an editor. An IDE includes an editor but a lot of other tools as well. 
&gt; If your outputs are correct, nothing is going to get unexpected inputs This is simply wrong. I have no idea what code might be calling my code. I could write a module that does some useful operation on an input, and someone could easily pass me an input which is *the correct output for their module*, but is not a correct input for mine. And yes, you could wrap a test around this, but we have a left over question: which module is incorrect? You say that this is something that no one worries about, but this is very much the kind of thing I worry about. I write code and do not always know how it will be used. Now, all that said- I think we agree on one point, OOP is bloated and complex. But you can have a strongly typed language that is not object oriented. They are often stronger languages. As someone who writes a fair bit of C and Python right now, I appreciate both paradigms. More and more, I appreciate types. Even when I'm stuck doing web stuff, which I avoid, TypeScript is simpler and more flexible with its optional type hints, and when you couple that with type algebra, you can describe incredibly complex programs simply on their operations on types- it's where the elegance of Haskell arises from. //On the types vs. tests, I admit my favorite language is Prolog, not because it's useful, but because it's interesting
I'm curious as to the use case? I can't say I've come across a reason for doing this, so I'm curious what everyone else's requirements are 
Very cool. I thought it was using cv to outline satellite images, but still cool nonetheless. 
At least I will learn on the way.
It needs a major rewrite.
Sounds like you have three distinct problems to solve: 1) functionality-level fault tolerance/hotswapping code - you definitely want modules + importlib.reload here as the top priority, with classes being useful but not a must. 2) run-time performance and fault tolerance - what you're looking for here is pretty much a MapReduce/functional paradigm, and your top priority would have to be to *avoid* tying anything down to an object state - your functions should ideally be entirely self-sufficient and deterministic. Also, you might want to look into Airflow/Luigi/Dask/PySpark. 3) maintainability - this is where you definitely need classes plus good old-fashioned SOLID, and in turn modules and packages are useful but a bit lower-priority concerns.
Or skip all this and simply use pendulum
What's easier to read? while True: long block of code or while rolled_a_double: long block of code This is one of the reasons why they're suggesting not using while true. It makes the code harder to understand as it grows.
No, they are not. Plugins have to be manually installed and have a lot of variation. An IDE consists of a debugger, refactoring tools, static analysis tools, source control integration, and more, all built in, all working together, with little to no configuration required. If you say I'm wrong, please tell me how I can 100% replace PyCharm and IntelliJ IDEA with some text editor and plugin configuration. Then tell me how long it took you to make sure everything works correcrly and how much time it took to configure everything to work properly.
Yes this is the perfect reference for my intentions! Thanks for the info

It is Cython, and calling it Python is a gigantic lie. I once had an argument with someone on reddit where they said that they see lies like this often yet I hadn't at all. I guess I've just been proven wrong. Don't get me wrong, the statement itself is fine. But only if it is actually true.
Asyncio is not the future. It is a failure usability wise.
Time taken to setup either is negligible compared to how long you'll work with the setup, and in any case people are going to spend ages messing about with the settings in pycharm and its plugins anyway. One of my recent postings which you can probably find has been about how to make pycharm work with mypy instead of its own type checker. It doesn't and you need to setup an external tool hook. Rather than get distracted by editor stuff, consider how much of a problem it is caused by new computers not coming with application software. Does anyone really care?
&gt;No gevent. Even though asyncio is the futuere, IT SUCKS (sometimes truth hurts). Completely agreed. gevent is superior to asyncio in every way.
It's what the powers that be wanted. Not the people.
&gt; Hy is a Lisp with clojure-like syntax With no clojure features like multiple dispatch. &gt; allows to program in a mostly functional way. Doable with standard Python already. The lisp "code as data" idea might have some promise, but I've never delved deep enough into Lisp to benefit from it. &gt; I think these features make it quite interesting for numerical analysis and data processing. * numerical analysis: has a standard math syntax that Lisp would force you to rethink * data processing: uh, we have plenty of data processing libraries in standard python syntax you are saying a lot, but backing it up with no case studies or code samples. &gt; 
Actually, every ~fast thing in python isn't python but some c/cython/fortran/rust underneath. So..
Not *every* one. But those that are don't claim to be "Python X", but rather, "X: Python Bindings for &lt;subject&gt;".
I don't know Ansible enough, I am exploring the option to use it ...one of the things that it does it can run commands for me on multiple devices which means the multithreading problem (parallelism) could be already solved for me 
My guess is some kind of realtime that probably would be better in a different language.
I would like to learn more about this option. Can you point me to some exaples or docs ? I will start googling right after I post here 
&gt; Time taken to setup either is negligible compared to how long you'll work with the setup, and in any case people are going to spend ages messing about with the settings in pycharm and its plugins anyway. Not true at all. With an external editor, every time a plugin updates the configuration has to be sure to be correct. Also, the literal only config change I've made to Pycharm since I've enabled settings sync is the keymap, depending on what platform I am on. With a simple text editor I can't do this. &gt; One of my recent postings which you can probably find has been about how to make pycharm work with mypy instead of its own type checker. It doesn't and you need to setup an external tool hook. Adding an external tool hook once vs finding and making sure a plugin works on every version change? Really? &gt; Rather than get distracted by editor stuff, consider how much of a problem is caused by new computers not coming with application software. Does anyone really care? Will you differentiate between a computer with preinstalled office suite, and one where you can install your own custom office suite in about an hour? Yes. It slows down how quickly I can get off the ground running. And considering I have no ability to easily sync settings, I have to waste time with little annoyances throughout my work. When I can have things "just work" with an editor, I'll gladly switch, because it is cheaper. But until then, I stick to my IDE.
I am not new to DBs but I have minimal experience with them, I understand the basics and I can run queries to correlate my data from various tables so I will probably stick with something simle
I use pycharm, and I made the switch before the scientific view came out. I found the debug mode was good enough. Once jupyter notebook was a thing, I switched to using that for prototyping before pycharm for deployment.
There are links to chapters 0 through 3. All of them are scrambled (for me anyway).
oh those poor businesses :( bootlicker. 
For 1, see this SO post: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28372127/add-edge-weights-to-plot-output-in-networkx For 2, this is probably controlled by matplotlib. For 3, see this https://networkx.github.io/documentation/networkx-1.10/reference/generated/networkx.relabel.relabel_nodes.html#networkx.relabel.relabel_nodes This is just from googling, so answers could be wrong. I've used matplotlib very rarely and never used networkx. 
Time to setup version control and a pypi server where you can make releases available to everyone in your organization and issue updates. Python packaging is awesome for what you're doing. My company uses artifactory as our pypi service and it's working great. We're able to share libraries, applications, test frameworks, etc and we've been able to build upon our past successes quickly. I'd strongly recommend you work on version control and packaging. It's liberating when you have these tools at your disposal.
sorry, that was a mistake. Its the \`id()\` func, not attribute. 
No idea my dude, have you tried getting on irc and asking?
I wouldn't recommend networkx for drawing graphs. You would have much better luck writing the graph out to file as either a `GEXF` or `.net` (pajek) format. Networkx provides functions to do this automatically. You can then load the graph in software like [Gephi](https://gephi.org/) which specializes in graph visualization. Gephi provides a range of node layouts including the popular force atlas layout, and it allows you to color and size nodes and edges in an easy way. Frankly, it would take thousands of lines of your own code and algorithms to even come close to being able to do something similar in networkx.
Doing the same. I’m currently using INE to learn Python. I have no idea how much I’ll end up using it, but the idea is that as the sole Network Engineer at my job I should be able to leverage Python to automate and simplify my job
This is awesome to me 
https://github.com/jvns/unix-command-survey/blob/master/command_survey_lib.py doesn't read CSV or write JSON. It accepts a specially-formed Pandas Datafrane (maybe you can make one from csv?) and emits a Dict (which resembles the json file, so you could use `json.dump` on the dict). The names of functions and their arguments should help you understand which is called with the results of the others. It's fairly linear, and happens to be (mostly) top-to-bottom.

Why would you bother? Python is a great glue language for calling into other stuff because it's extremely readable, very expressive, has strong community standards and doesn't have much in the way of obtuse syntax. The fact that you can call into other stuff from python is great because it's really nice to write in python, but be able to sidestep python's flaws (speed) using lower-level languages as appropriate. Inventing a separate language whose major strength is that you can call into python doesn't seem to offer much in the way of benefits.
We aren't writing self everywhere. Only when we want to access a specific instances' scope. You don't have to access class scoped variables you could access method scoped variables or not even use a class at all. It's not verbose, it's necessary only when you make it necessary. Read up on scope in python to get a better understanding. I think your frustration is due to an incomplete picture in your mind of how things work. Fill in more of the blanks and you'll find it's NBD.
If the writes are relatively fast compared to the rest of the work, synchronize the writing portion of the code using a global lock.

&gt;When I can have things "just work" with an editor, I'll gladly switch, because it is cheaper. But until then, I stick to my IDE. No one is asking you to change what tool you're using. I'm just saying they're all IDEs now, because they all do the same thing, no-one can agree on what the exact dividing line between editor and IDE is, and for most software it doesn't matter anyway; therefore the boundary is imaginary.
Did you use any books or courses to learn network automation or did you just hop into the documentation for the libraries? If so, what books/courses would you recommend? I'm currently going through David Bombal's which is great so far, but I'm interested in how others went about their Python journey.
Python is older than Java, so they’re the weirdos. 
&gt; I'm just saying they're all IDEs now, because they all do the same thing, no-one can agree on what the exact dividing line between editor and IDE is, and for most software it doesn't matter anyway; therefore the boundary is imaginary. And I'm saying they aren't IDEs. Because the "integration" factor is gone.
Why is integration gone? Plugins on an editor like Atom or VSCode are installed and updated from a repository. The only difference between those and Pycharm or IntelliJ is which plugins are installed when you default install the app. Is there an authoritive defintion of what functionality is needed to count as an IDE? So you're creating an imaginary dividing line.
Install the atom-python-run package, I just press F5 and the file I have open in Atom runs, awesome package.
I have it running on a cron currently. It is hosted on a vps I pay for. Here is the code: https://pastebin.com/pDm5HY5y And the requirements.txt: https://pastebin.com/Szg77aPM I hope to clean it up soon and have it only run while I am awake...just need to figure out the logic for that! Any code tips are welcome, I am pretty new to this.
Please try to get the source using git clone comand and try to run that. It may work.
I started with Automate The Boring Stuff, then did some vid training. Now read up on specific examples of what I want to do and figure it out. For example I found out how useful sets where recently. heh.
Seems I'm on the right path then. I read ATBS, then Python Crash Course, now taking that video course and will probably read Fluent Python next just to go deeper into the language, all while studying for ICND2. I'm having a great time building both networking and programming skills in tandem, lucky to be passionate about both. Also I plan on reading Violent Python and Gray Hat Python + Black Hat Python after finishing my current materials, but it seems those books have libraries without Python 3 support so I'll see how that goes.
Last i used cpp, i never needed to use "this" .

Oh sorry, my mistake, the link to read Chapter 1 for free is separate from the Live Book. You can find it on the main page. It says "Chapter 1" under "free downloads" and it leads to a PDF of Chapter 1: [https://www.manning.com/books/classic-computer-science-problems-in-python](https://www.manning.com/books/classic-computer-science-problems-in-python) I think the publisher should just make it unscrambled in the Live Book. I'll mention this to them on our next call, but of course that's their call.
rebase first, then merge -no-ff gives a prettier gitk history picture. This matters when there are more than 3 people working on the project. typical work flow is: make a branch off the 'main' branch you will eventually commit to * commit your changes as you set fit * rebase periodically * rebase and git merge -no-ff to the 'main' branch At my work [Jenkins ](https://jenkins.io/) does the final step (after compiling and running the 'basic regression' test suite). We never merge to an \*\*official\*\* branch ourselves.
myself, I do "git rebase -i ..." because maybe I want to squash 10 development commits to 2 official commits. Also, I don't do the merge, our tool (jenkins) does.
exactly. Real world programming is complicated enough. Anything you can do (like rebase first, then merge -no-ff) to make things simpler really helps.
I'm not really suggesting scrapy here, or any other framework for that matter, just that he set up his scraper to run independently of his web app. The way OP worded the post sounded like he wanted a visit to a specific URL to kick off the crawl and then display the results, which isn't really an ideal setup IMO.
Nope, just a small script that imitates Mac OS Mojave dynamic wallpapers.
I’ve got it. Still doesn’t feel right. Guess I wish atom had the ability to detach panels and open them as new windows. I’m used to arranging things so I have a prompt in the bottom left corner, VLC or YouTube above it, atom or ide next to those, file explorer hidden behind that.
I have a small script that imitates Mac OS Mohave. I needed this behavior in, in order to figure out which wallpaper Is next. The script creates a list of the wallpapers in the order which they need to put and with the date time they need to be assigned. Date times are used in order to be more versatile(ie total duration of the wallpaper is &gt;24 hours). There were some complications I tried to generate on demand the wallpapers so my solution revolves around resetting the list and resyncing when the time changes abruptly.
I will release the next version. I need to create a separate 64bit version. Thanks for pointing out.
in Python, we just don’t do a multi line in line function. if it’s larger than a line use def, if it can fit in a line readable use lambda. Python programs aren’t structured that way on purpose.
“this” is used to show that you are accessing a class member. Some people use it, some don’t.
As much as I love gevent and am not fond of asyncio, having implicit context switches at every potentially blocking call would be a huge and difficult-to-debug breaking change.

Corvil - a high end tool for network analysis used often in finance and trading is all python in the backend.
I created a 64bit version, you can download it from the releases page. Please tell me.if it works.
So I've only been learning Python for about a month now. I don't totally understand everything that was required for the final product here, but I understand enough of it to know what is going on. The point I want to make is that simply reading articles like this help me learn the way to think as a programmer. If someone asked me to write code to pick out large bodies of water in an image file, I wouldn't know where to start, but reading the process of breaking down the image into a binary file was great information. Then the author further broke the problem down by returning the size of the image in pixels. It was simply a matter of finding each pixel with the proper color code from there. Just the way the author went about solving this problem is inspirational to me as a lowly noob. It inspires me to try and think outside the box. Thank you for posting this.
