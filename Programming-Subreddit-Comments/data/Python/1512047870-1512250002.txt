Yes, the proxy settings in the PyCharm settings menu. It works for checking for updates, git operations, etc. If I do a pip install in DOS, I usually 'set http_proxy=http://user:pass@proxy:8080' to get me going. I tried setting env variables to that but it didn't help PyCharm along.
Not wide enough apparently.
We had a reward system with my daughter. When ever she did well, we dropped a penny in a tip jar. Since I had a few days off, I wrote a quick Alexa skill where we could add/remove pennies into her account. I have it to where it will add/subtract a random amount into the account. 
The first one that came to mind was a sort-of desktop virtual reality. It tracked the head position of a user through facial recognition and altered the camera position in a 3D world to make it look more 3D without the need for headwear. Unfortunately, facial recognition is a slow process and you could get maybe 5FPS at best. It also couldn't perceive depth (only 1 camera on my laptop). But it wasn't bad for around 2 hours work and provided a decent effect at low head speeds.
Yeah, I kind of know they're there, but my fingers don't. I also miss the Emacs find interface where you navigate dirs, and open or creat a file, vs pycharms fuzzier find. Not even sure on the create shortcut. Maybe because I can use the mouse, I do?
The API only allows up to 1000 entries for any listing.

https://github.com/pypa/warehouse/issues/869 For some reason it seems more complex than one would assume. I still don't really understand why though, after having followed that ticket for a while...
Even the RST renderer is pretty terrible. Tiny tiny "mistakes" makes it fail and then you get plaintext. One such mistake can be to use "~~~~~" as header marker when it thinks "-----" is the one you wanted at that level.
If I have a chance to update again today ill give it a whirl.
At my old job we had a serious lack of IT expertise. One day this consultant came in and wrote a script which automated a boring excel job which someone did every week and took several hours to complete. So that's how I was introduced to what programming languages can do. Amazed, I checked out Python and learned the basics. I then asked my boss if there was a report they'd like that our system wasn't able to produce. I then wrote a script which took in three Excel sheets which the system *was* able to produce and output the output the one that my boss wanted. It took me several hours but it was quite satisfying!
Thats a big increase from what I had. What happens when you switch branches and it index's again? 
True. Vim Python bindings are for its plugins. That being said, having setting up a vimrc is an asset. Typically if you need vim to work remotely using ssh.
Sure! The very first project I did was useless, but helped a lot with learning the basics. I wanted to learn Django because its useful and has excellent documentation, how to use web APIs, and how to use a CSS framework other than Bootstrap. So, I built a simple web app that queried my Meetup.com account, saved my meetups in a django model, the displayed the meetup name, date, location, and description on a webpage Material Design card style. Then I added a tweet button to each card that would tweet the meetup info. The CSS framework was Materialize CSS. I learned a LOT with this one. That project took me months. Now I could easily write it in a few hours. The next project I did was a simple web app to manage my finances. I wanted to learn how to use: Flask/Jinja2 instead of Django/Django Templating Language, json as data storage instead of Postgresql (used that with django), and pure python classes instead of django models to model data relationships (if you dont know what that last one means thats ok. learn a bit about django models and foreignkeys, then try to think about how youd do the same things without django relationships. its a bit tricky at first). This app took recurring transactions that go into/come out of my accounts every month, both income and expense, and projected those into the future so I could see how much money I would have in savings if I stuck to a finance plan over the next year. The most recent project was pretty simple, I wanted to learn how to scrape web pages, use Twilio to send text messages with python, set up an app on Heroku, and use cron to make a script run daily. So, the app that scraped the 1000 most common french words from a website along with their descriptions and english equivalent just one time, stored those in json, then every day (using cron) picked 3 random words from the json file and texted those to my phone. Those words would be moved to a separate 'used_words' json file. The project was cool and worked well, but unfortunately Heroku doesnt actually save files so I could edit the json files in place if I hosted on Heroku :/ so, time to learn something else new! I'm in the process of trying MongoDB instead of json files so that I can host it on Heroku. And by 'in the process' I mean I hit that wall and havevnt touched it in about a month because I moved on to other stuff xD Hope that helps! Feel free to steal those ideas or ask any questions if you run into issues
in my country $89 is too much for any development tool irrespective of how good it is
that sounds super complicated jesus, it only took 2 hours?
I had to take an intro Java class after already having learned programming in non-Java languages. Instead of paying attention, I wrote a basic text adventure in Python. The code was a mess, and it took me forever to get it to work, but work it did, and I was damn proud of it.
Should be optional. Same for gitlab ci.
I still haven't found a way to make Pycharm run snippets of code and function in Pycharm the way Ipython or Spyder with %autoreload does. The Pycharm-embedded Ipython doesn't do it; have to reload the console, redo all imports etc.
Does this have addon compatibility with Sanic, Quart, APIStar and the other Flask replacements?
Reading your code, I don't understand your critics about GA or Siri, Clarissa is also a Q&amp;A bot, plus you don't check user input with regex, so user must enter the exact commands to get answer. At this time it's the same bot that lot of users have already coded. If you can include ML in it that's will be great. I also think you should use a client/server model for developing it if you want it to be available on web/Android/computer.
my graphical blackjack game in my intro class was definitely a fun achievement for me at the time. more recently, a reversi-playing AI 
That would be the *European* warming period, right? Because according to the Denialists, is Europe is warm, the whole world must be.
Often enough. I use it to plot my scraper's database, for validation, basic user info plotting, git repo stats, etc. I also work with "data scientists", and I sometimes 'pandaize' code that's a mix of plain old Python, numpy, sklearn, etc.
That is a shame. I wonder if you can send something to JetBrains about possible region based pricing. It is often unfair to many countries whose economy isn't equal to the big players and makes the "one internet price" not a fair deal. They do well with students and teachers, but don't have a multi-tier for various economies.
Yeah. Though I sort fused two separate programs - 3D and face recog. - into one
I made a program that would plot the magnetic field around a wire in 3D. It solved the Biot Savart law and used Mayavi to plot. It was my senior year in engineering and I was sad that I was about to lose my access to MatLab. I was not impressed by the 3d plots Matlab made. I feel in love with the plotting ability of matplotlib and Mayavi.
Why not call them heretics because they do not share your faith? The good Lord knows this is not based on science. 
It seems to need a load of headroom to complete some one time action seemingly related to indexing, and then after that I've found it uses less ram overall for me. going from ~500mb to ~300mb on my currently Django project
N-body sim (gravity simulation) in 3d. You could choose how many bodies and their range of masses, and it would randomly place all of them with random masses, and then let the simulation go, where they would all orbit each other. It was written in pure python, using numpy only for arrays, so it was superrrr slow. Would take a few minutes to calculate 10 seconds worth of simulation. The 3d camera would slowly rotate around all the bodies, and they would all leave a trail behind. One of the first times I realized programming's ability to keep me up until the wee hours of the morning ;) 
Created a set of python scripts that cloned oracle databases
That's a really good suggestion, thanks!!
During my experiments with Python and OpenCV, I accidentally inserted RGB values where was expected HSV, for a color filter. Somehow it selected only my face, and it looked pretty cool Screeenshot it and used as profile pic to this day. I'll put a link to it later.
I performed some work extracting the binary grammar from a large collection of BTrieve and Pervasive SQL files (the drivers that Pervasive ship are highly unreliable). Normally I'd lean on C++ to build an extraction tool, but figured that writing the extraction tool would give me some good practice in Python. Surprised myself at how quickly it all came together and how fast the extraction was. Maintained it for a few years until the company I was working for finally migrated everything.
It hasn't changed anything really but it does make it easier if you like the Linux way of doing things. 
One of the things Python excels in is solving one-time problems. For that, pandas is absolutely brilliant. It's also perfectly good for frequent tasks. I was involved in a legal case where I needed to supply and analyse my entire text message history. I downloaded an app to create a csv of my messaging history, read it in to pandas, filtered by names, filtered by keywords, sorted by date, then wrote a script to show me all matches along with the surrounding context and allowing me to vet them, and then wrote a small script to format them to appear as date/time - message. In 20 minutes, I did what would've taken a layman days. When I spoke to our lawyer, I said "here are 172 instances where the plaintiff acknowledges the contract". The lawyer bought me dinner.

That’s how I feel!! You lifted my spirits. Was getting so beaten up. My interviewer didn’t seem pleased with my choice of pandas and asked me why I did that. I wish he bought me dinner and...a job of course lol

I read a post where a guy's father was a businessman and he had to submit combination of many excel sheets to an auditor. He asked his father to mail him the sheets and replied with the aggregated sheets within 5 minutes. His father realised that his son became a true engineer that day.
So as a web dev, it’s useless to me. Which means it’s $90. That $90 doesn’t cover html, css, and js. So that’s even more for a second ide for those tools. Why am I hearing Vader in the background, “I am altering the Deal. Pray I don’t alter it any further”
I once tried working with openCV in java. Couldn't get past an hour with it. Will try with Python soon. Any suggestions?
Been there (java). Just creating a set and adding values seems a mess.
Subprocess if your friend, but if it's for calculating md5 better use only python
You just create another one env with new empty package list, without resetting previous one
How to use gambling to get your kids to do chores 101 lol.
Yes, thanks, I did. I think the fact that I had SSH on a non-standard port on the server led to problems. I'll have another go (because I had problems with Wing initially but then got it working perfectly but I do prefer the environment in PyCharm).
Thanks but that sounds just as clunky as the NPP FTP solution. :) In Wing I can just open a project (as long as Pageant is running) and it's as if the files are local.
Is it really widely used? Almost everyone I know writes markdown and machine-translates to RST.
Mine was similar. Took a huge spreadsheet with stats and schedules for the whole department and split it up into versions for each manager. 
YES. It has made life incredibly more convenient. You can just click open a Bash shell and it loads in one second. You can install a whole LAMP stack and test Linux things locally. Plus it mounts your windows file system so you can work directly on the same files. I use it all the time for development and testing. It is way way way more convenient and faster than virtual machine and lets you compile and run and test linux things.

It has made me slightly more inclined to believe that Microsoft doesn't still *hate* developers.

Gotta Skinner Box those kids into obedience, get an Amazon Dash button they get to press if they've done a chore, and program it to sometimes reward them with a flashy animation and sound on the TV. Get them addicted to doing chores, that or prime them for a life of gambling addiction.
You are probably looking for the `after` and `before` functionality https://www.reddit.com/dev/api/
My first fun thing was making a python script that took the top 5 posts from various subreddits for a given 24 hours and compiled them in a digest for me. It ran whenever I turned my pc on and every 3 hours after that. It could do it so much quicker than booting up chrome or some other browser.
What a surprise to see the author of the book himself commenting on my post. Thank you for taking the time to respond. You and other users have helped a ton and I'm happy to say I've moved on and am learning a lot.
I made a wrapper around msvcrt to make things like getch and khbit much more friendly for both users and developers. Instead of getch() waiting for a key to be pressed, then returning an integer, get_key() returns the name of the key currently being pressed as a String, which can be None. It's still a little buggy in the way it creates those strings, but things like that make it much nicer to use in development. I also made a class I called PixelPainter that generates an image based on a function that generates an RGB color based on the x and y position of a given pixel. Using it is as simple as defining a class that extends it, and overriding pixel(x, y). It's designed for images that take a huge amount of time to draw, such as a 15k resolution Mandelbrot Set that took nearly a week of runtime to generate. As such, it has a lot of other functionality built in as well, such as the ability to save its progress and quit, then begin again the next time it's run, the ability to check how far into the current line it is, etc, as well as it being very simple to implement more such functionality. These utilize my msvcrt wrapper extensively, and it really is so much nicer than using it itself. 
It’s how it is supposed to work. Or rather that’s what we are technically telling the DB to do.
I tried to do something like this with openCV, but making a servo track your face IRL, I could get about 20 FPS by default, but that was after some fiddling with parameters and culling the detector to stop searching after it found one face, there are lots of other optimisations I was told I could make by a guy at my local hackspace, but they require some complex meddling with the input codec (You can limit the search to the parts of the image that are moving, and the codec coming from the camera has already done this motion detecting work for you), but I could never be bothered to do them. It also turns out that for what I wanted to do there existed a solution using two IR led's mounted on a pair of glasses being detected by a WiiMote.
In this thread, giants and pygmies standing on the shoulders of giants-- I am the latter and Python is super friendly to me and my ilk. The first thing that put my flag and bushes at full mast was a python script that parsed a json return string and propagated specific values into the next awscli API request on repeat to eventually stand up a horizontally scaling AWS environment-- VPC, reverse proxy, load balancers, autoscaling... everything but the congfig setting &amp; base images for the instances. An entire new environment stood up in less than 15 minutes.
Why isn't the db engine able to work out what we are doing and optimise the query, like the C compiler does?
Cam you give us also the formula of the filter?
Private asistent. Shes called Astra. Astra can talk, take voice input and help me get things done faster on my pc. Year after the “end“ of creating her I am still adding some new features
When my kids were in grade school, my wife took on the task of putting together the yearbook for the school (averaged around 450 kids). On the class pages, every kid's picture was put into a Quark Express image box of the same size. The problem was that the photos were not always centered, so doing the fit image in the box looked bad. After doing the first class, decided that this needed a different approach. Wrote a program (wxWindows, PIL, python 1.52) that I could go through the directory of images, pull up the image, center and clip the image to the box size. To center the image, I had to point to the center of the face, on the nose and at eye level. The program would then clip and save the image. I could clean up all of the photos in about 20 minutes. The class pages took about 15 minutes with the cleaned images, versus the 30+minutes of trying to manually center (on the face, not the image) in Quark. Side note, the program would crash after 300 or so images. But it was good enough for the job. 
My previous job had two anti virus products, one for network detections (Snort) and one for file detections (ClamAV). ClamAV has a C signature language called bytecode (because it compiled to LLVM bytecode). Just about every analyst knew how to write Snort rules but many found it a pain to write the bytecode signatures. I wrote a Python script to take the Snort rules (and all their matching components) and output a ClamAV bytecode signature. It was a total blast and one of the cooler things I've written. Maintaining state of the variables and tracking them was fun (they could be referenced later in the signature as offsets).
The first "real" program that I wrote was some part counting software for my company. It takes a photo shot from a webcam and counts the number of items within the picture. A dropdown list of part numbers allows for the user to choose a part and for the threshold settings to automatically change to better suit what's being counted. At home, I hacked an old motion detector and set it up with a Raspberry Pi to turn on an LCD screen containing the taplist on my kegerator whenever someone went in the garage to grab a beer. I had it set up with speech recognition and TTS capability, but it just didn't flow the way I wanted, so I removed all the speech capability. 
I made a secret Santa program where everyone in the family is assigned a secret Santa. It can’t be their spouse, and it can’t be the person they had last year. The program then emails each person who they have so that no one has to keep track of who everyone has. It was pretty cool for me!
For March Madness every year my company and another company participate in a pool where we all throw in $10 or $20 (I forget which) and fill out brackets. Now, I know absolutely nothing about college basketball, so last year just wrote a little script to randomly select a winner based on their seed number. e.g. 1 seed vs. 16 seed - the 1 seed has a 16/17 chance of being picked and the 16 seed has a 1/17 chance of being picked. I ran that for each match to pick a winner. I ended up winning the tournament.
Yeah. I once got pumped up looking at jarvis. All my script does is tell me good morning/afternoon/evening and then look for top results to bugs i have. I still have my hands addicted to launching browser and searching for bug fixes though !!
&gt; To be fair, all the contestants (including Go) were running a single-worker process. Servers were load tested using wrk with 1 thread, 100 connections, and 24 simultaneous (pipelined) requests per connection (cumulative parallelism of 2400 requests). 
I can't remember what the **first*" interesting thing i made was, but the **most** interesting thing was a set of games controlled using a BCI (brain-computer interface). Recently i made a program that generates an svg (scalable vector graphics) file of a clean/dirty sign for the dishwasher using given dimensions that can be laser cut.
Still new at python but so far my favorite tool I made is a proxy scraper haha. Learning how to mess with csv files now and it's also really fun. Python is a great language to learn . 
Hi! Does package installation work via "Settings | Project | Interpreter" UI?

I honestly don't know. That's a good question for /r/PostgreSQL or /r/Database maybe. I'm more confused by the addition of sampling without the ability to sample a specific number of rows. I'm sure there's a good reason for it, but for now i've got no clue. If you find anything out, let me know. 
Here's a sneak peek of /r/PostgreSQL using the [top posts](https://np.reddit.com/r/PostgreSQL/top/?sort=top&amp;t=year) of the year! \#1: [PostgreSQL 10 Released](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/release-10.html) | [17 comments](https://np.reddit.com/r/PostgreSQL/comments/74fzl5/postgresql_10_released/) \#2: [PostgreSQL 10 Beta 1 Released](https://www.postgresql.org/about/news/1749/) | [3 comments](https://np.reddit.com/r/PostgreSQL/comments/6bwdvg/postgresql_10_beta_1_released/) \#3: [New Features Coming in PostgreSQL 10](http://rhaas.blogspot.com/2017/04/new-features-coming-in-postgresql-10.html) | [1 comment](https://np.reddit.com/r/PostgreSQL/comments/647gil/new_features_coming_in_postgresql_10/) ---- ^^I'm ^^a ^^bot, ^^beep ^^boop ^^| ^^Downvote ^^to ^^remove ^^| [^^Contact ^^me](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=sneakpeekbot) ^^| [^^Info](https://np.reddit.com/r/sneakpeekbot/) ^^| [^^Opt-out](https://np.reddit.com/r/sneakpeekbot/comments/6l7i0m/blacklist/)
[Nielsen](https://github.com/IrishPrime/Nielsen). It renames and organizes some media for me. Kind of hit a sweet spot for me of automating something I was spending a lot of time on, being potentially useful for other people, and giving me an opportunity to experiment with some libraries I hadn't used before.
I remember a story where a guy wrote a script to do his entire day's work in 5 minutes. Instead of presenting it to his superiors he fucked around all day and finished his work at the last 5 minutes of the day. Did this for years.
What would be your recommendation to go the compiled executable route? Is this a difficult thing to do?
I create a python script using OpenCV lib which converted a image which had verses written in Sanskrit (from a predetermined font) into Unicode representation. It used simple template matching to match the letters and modifiers present in the image. It was fairly nontrivial and loved working on it.
What's your recommendation for compiling executables? I'll be doing a little research on venv on the side.
I for sure am putting together ansible environments with rundeck on the side to run playbooks on a schedule. But executing these along with standalone python scripts are "scary" for some of my non-programming minded teammates. That's why I'm looking for a way to present the script functionality without the magic, so people are more comfortable using them. 
Interesting for *me*, but probably not for more advanced programmers or math geeks. I made a program that would test a number for primality, and if it was composite it would give me the prime factors and also (the trickiest part, for me) the exponents of those factors.
Three months after I learned to program I built a tiny top down shooter. I've been doing game stuff ever since.
I created a tool which would allow me to created up to 100 thousand 10 second mp3 files. Each was sampled from a random timestamp from a pool of existing mp3s. Each was given a unique artist name, album name, and song title. This was done to test the USB cataloging feature in automotive. 
My first serious python program was a rewrite of a perl script that parsed access logs for stats. The Perl script ran in minutes. The python version using the same rough logic ran in a fraction of the time on the same files. (&gt;50mb logs). My mind is still blown about that. 
I created a [suite](https://github.com/TomButts/Lichen-Project) of image recognition and machine learning tools. Based mainly on TensorFlow library and Scikit-learn. Best bit was being able to create models based on the algorithm described in [this](https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_workshops_2014/W15/papers/Razavian_CNN_Features_Off-the-Shelf_2014_CVPR_paper.pdf) paper. Hadn't used python before this. Wish I still got to use it as I only scratched the surface of the language.
Command line tools for working with Auth0.
&gt; to take advantage of **modern** CPUs. &gt; employs text processing instructions found in modern CPUs with SSE4.2 extensions (**almost any 10-year**-old x86_64 CPU has it) Hmm...
I have written a couple of python scripts, one to automatically test a bunch of cisco video conferencing codec to test if they're able to send packets between each other with out being blocked by a firewall. A script to enable automatic provisioning of users in call manager. Now i'm working on my own project of building a more complex class server, just to build a better understanding of OOP. Only been working on it a week, but I have been loving it. I have got being able to join/leave channels and chat in channels done so far. I have had to refactor a few times once I realize where I spun up that instance of a class that is not in appropriate location. Loads of fun for me, wife hates it though.
Yeah, once i did the bounce game, my mind was wandering around all games I played when I was a kid and how they must've been designed.
Nice read
I'm saving machine learning models that inherit from a base class and override/add new functions. I want to be able to query the database for accuracy by the functions the model used.
Those are actually some really neat ideas, thanks. Once school calms down, you'll be hearing more from me. As for the web design, my friend is currently interested in that stuff (and fairly good at it for being mostly self-taught) so maybe I'll ask him how he learned his design stuff and learn 2 things at once! Also, about your French cron script: would it not be the same to just remove the chosen words from the "available_words" json instead of creating another one? Was it just so if you decided to rerun your scraper you could input that "used_words" json and blacklist those to get a fresh set? Or maybe I'm not thinking about it right and it's something really obvious.
That's not true. WebStorm and DataGrip are included in the professional version of PyCharm, so you get your support for html, css and js along with frameworks bundled into the 90$ fee.
Could you elaborate on your concerns with static typing?
Sorry, I misread this [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/7gdt9s/pycharm_20173_is_out_now/dqjyr63/), I shouldn't post before my first cup of coffee. Still doesn't change the fact that the free version won't support web dev as jyper was trying to sell me on it.
Could you share that script? Sounds awesome. 
a wrapper around ffmpeg, thetvdb and mp4-v2. It would convert any video file that was not mp4 and then properly tag any tv shows.
the only honest answer
Awesome, feel free to PM me any time when you get back to it! Yep, removing words from the original json was what I did so that I would never get the same word until the words were exhausted, adding to used_words was basically future proofing: when the original list was exhausted, I would copy used_words back into the original file, remove everything from used_words, and start all over. But, either way, heroku won't allow for any kind of file editing like that. It did work fine when I left my PC running 24/7 waiting for the cron script, though. Json files definitely weren't the best solution for the problem to begin with, but the project did serve it's purpose: Now I know how to scrape websites, create and manipulate json files, and set up cron scripts :)
I agree. I think all universities should switch from Matlab to one of the many free alternatives. Unfortunately, so much work has been built in MatLab. There is so much institutional inertia behind MatLab. I'd also like MS Word to die. Ideally, most documents would be web compatible with a few extra bits to allow for nice printing. 
If you use Matlab like a calculator it's not bad. If you use it like a programming language, may the gods have mercy on your soul.

The Python standard library documentation is in RST and almost all open source packages as well. Maybe people are using MD to RST but that workflow breaks down if you have PR to merge.
In case OP doesn't respond, [PRAW](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) should give you a head start if you want to develop your own app to do the same.
I know you can generate a PDF with vector spot colors with ReportLab, but I also know that's not the questions you asked. If you find a way to do this, I'd like to hear about it. 
There is a book called "Automate the Boring stuff with Python" has almost exactly what you ate talking about as a practice project in there. 
I learned Python because I wanted to do sentiment analysis, and NLTK was the best NLP package or any programming language at the time, so Python it was. So my first interesting program was a sentiment analysis script that would measure sentiment polarity for input text, which then evolved into sentdex.com, which was my first real full-scale project. I figured I had to answer because &gt; but this is way more fun than building scalable websites or analyzing data. For me, there's some crazy draw towards playing with "data" that I just can't explain. That's what's always driven me to learn programming. 
Sentdex? Big fan. I learnt flask using your tutorial. Someone recommended your tutorials on this very sub
Thank you so much! I just actually saw someone post their Udemy course with this exact same title for free and I jumped on it!
I created a Twitter bot that anyone could @ it with the name of a subreddit and it would call on a reddit bot to get the top 5 posts of that day for the subreddit the user tweeted and would tweet it back at the user
Good deal. It's a great intro book to Python, or even Object-oriented programming in general.
Calling it a Python 3.5+ library is downright misleading, if anything it's a CPython library, or Python bindings for a C library. There's nothing wrong with that, just doesn't roll off the tongue as easily I suppose.
[angrysearch](https://github.com/DoTheEvo/ANGRYsearch) I switched to linux from windows windows has this abso-fucking-lutly amazing thing called [Everything Search](https://www.voidtools.com/) [here](https://i.frogbox.es/iav) it is shown in action. If you get used to ability to just press hotkey start typing and open what you want... launch what you want... find any possible file everywhere on your system.. well that thing is missed tremendously when its gone. While linux had lot of search utilties, none felt like it was good replacement and everyone acted like I insulted their whole family when I pointed out what features what alternative misses. So I made angrysearch which is just poors man replacement as it lacks some features, most notably the instant awareness to any changes, but still I am happy with it.
Made a program that filtered out an excel database for my company. I also made a program that provided fake data to submit to my boss... something I don’t recommend but oh well 
Figure out the HTTP requests that are sending when you click through each page, submit just the requests in sequence instead of waiting for the page to load.
"I have installed Pillow but don't know how to add it to my library" doesn't make any sense. What do you mean? Do you have trouble importing the library? Are you sure it actually did install correctly?
The Udemy course is based on that book, If I were you I'll enroll in the course and buy the book. Another book but for more Intermediate/Advance is "Python Tricks: The Book" by Dan Bader, it helps you to improve your python programming skills

A discussion with Katharine Jarmul, kjam, about some of the challenges of data science with respect to testing. Some of the topics we discuss: * experimentation vs testing * testing pipelines and pipeline changes * automating data validation * property based testing * schema validation and detecting schema changes * using unit test techniques to test data pipeline stages * testing nodes and transitions in DAGs * testing expected and unexpected data * missing data and non-signals * corrupting a dataset with noise * fuzz testing for both data pipelines and web APIs * datafuzz * hypothesis * testing internal interfaces * documenting and sharing domain expertise to build good reasonableness * intermediary data and stages * neural networks * speaking at conferences
Are you using the ["waits"](http://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/waits.html) in selenium driver or explicit time.sleep()? Ie. `element.wait_for_element_to_be_clickable()`
I wrote a version of MadLibs for a class project that kept stats on the words used and randomized stories using word lists. My professor said it was too simple of a project, so I switched and built 3D animated plots of a pro golfer's shot using data from the PGA Tour.
Your solution seems fine to me 'cause you don't need to take care of sessions and cookies and other bot prevention measures thanks to selenium. You can try Selenium with Headless Chrome, it should be a little time improvement 
Thanks for your response but my initial post was not triggered by what I had not seen in a blog post but rather by what I thought had been explicitly advertised by JetBrains. Please correct me if I am mistaken, but I will provide a quick example. For instance, this archive.org [snapshot](https://web.archive.org/web/20171017035936/http://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/features/editions_comparison_matrix.html) from October 17, 2017 of the PyCharm page on the JetBrains website has "Scientific Tools" listed under "Free" or "Supported in Professional and Community Editions". This is what confused me with regards to the present release. Your clarification of the matter would be much appreciated.
I made a game called “JibJab”, which was a dungeon themed click and shoot game. Your character was a little green goblin with a knife, and he had a jabbing animation. The thing that took me a while to figure out was how to make the entire screen black except for a small circle around the goblin that would light up the area around you. I really loved that game and had many plans to actually make it a real project until I left my flash drive in my class and had it returned to me with a corrupt file. What really pissed me off was that some of the code was still in the file, but it was only the top 1/4 of the program...
I made something similar to that too! My son was very young at the time, so it also randomly assigned a proxy to assist him with buying a present - of course, it had to make sure that the proxy wasn't the same person that he was meant to be buying a present for!
I'm using the wait for it to be clickable
Pythonic wrapper for a very expensive tool that only had a .NET API. Saving around 20/hrs of engineering time per week.
How would that improve it / what is Headless Chrome? I've never heard of it.

It would put them at a disadvantage in industry. We already have a hard enough time finding engineers that know Matlab and Simulink well enough to hire.
There are a couple of issues with the code, I've noted the first one I spotted below. Lists are zero indexed. The below chunk of code assigns elOuter as currList[1] and elInner as currList[0], then swaps them if the value at position [0] is smaller than [1] - so it sorts backwards in the very first step. for elOuter in range(1,len(currList)): for elInner in range(elOuter - 1, -1, -1): if currList[elInner] &lt; currList[elOuter]: poppedIdx = currList.pop(elInner) currList.insert(elOuter, poppedIdx) One other thing, the [Python style guide](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) calls for using snake case as opposed to camel case: so "curr_list" instead of "currList".
A sort of a robot's head that automatically moved directly towards detected face. The head was basically a webcam on top of 2 servos, which allowed the cam to be moved left, right, bottom, top. The brains was a computer called beagleboard black (sort of like raspberry pi) running Python and opencv to detect the face.
I would strongly recommend you not store code in a database. Create hashes and signatures of your code and store/query that. Store file paths to the code. But don't store the code itself. If you want to emulate the code being stored in the database, but don't want to do the above, you could create a polymorphic type which stores a unique ID in the database (so it can be queried) but the implementation of the code exists on the model definition. For instance: class A(Model): pass class B(A): def custom_method(self): pass b = A.query.filter(id=b_id).first() asset isinstance(b, B) b.custom_method()
/u/AnimalFactsBot is way more fun than all the 'important' full stack apps I've made.
Since I don't have chrome at work and had no way of accessing pay walled sites, I built a web app that would scrape any ft/wsj article given a URL and display it on a web page. I changed the referrer in the get request header to google/fb, used beautiful soup to scrape, flask to build the app and hosted it on heroku. 
I know it's a pipedream but MatLab should die out in industry and universities. There are better languages that are completely free. Simulink is pretty amazing but MatLab just sucks for developments. 
Wrote a script for work that reads an XML from one of our systems and writes certain data to a CSV (later updated it to write directly to Excel). This enabled the creation of a new workflow as the system still can't (even if we were willing to pay for it) output that data in any useable format
&gt; What options are out there for scaping my finances? Very limited. Banks and the like have layers of protection to prevent bot access, because identity thieves use them. Your best bet is to find a bank that has an official API or other way to access your data. Otherwise I'm guessing you'll have the most luck with Selenium, or manually downloading your statement every month and writing the program to parse that. --- If you have more questions like this it's better to post them on /r/learnpython. Be sure to [format your code for reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/faq#wiki_how_do_i_format_code.3F) or use a site like pastebin. Also, include which version of python and what OS you are using. 
There should be a small chance that turning in a chore plays a lot of flashing lights and music and she gets $1.00 as a jackpot. No chores left undone once they're addicted!
Checking primality efficiently is cool. Did you use memoization? (Spellcheck hates that word)
That's a great way to make yourself indispensable. There are a lot of data management jobs out there that would immensely benefit from an employee with even the smallest bit of scripting ability
Thanks
I wrote a library that lets students in a high school class control a watercoloring robot: http://blog.jrheard.com/watercolorbot
I made a basic implementation of RSA. Plenty of math concepts to learn for that one. It's awesome how Python is chill with enormous numbers.
That’s awesome. It’s a shame family members are unlikely to appreciate the work that went into it the same way people in this community can.
You can try to do direct HTTP requests as suggested, though I would imagine that would trigger any type of semi-competent anti-fraud system that the website is using. I'd try disabling the loading of images and maybe running NoScript to block any unnecessary analytics scripts that the site is running. If you're doing this from your own computer, perhaps consider putting it on a cheap VPS instead (and using a reloadable credit card because you obviously don't want you CC information sitting on a server you don't physically control.)
I tried that one, but gave up when it got to collisions, they look a lot easier than they actually are :P
I made a really shitty AI chat bot called Xeria. It didn't use any machine learning, but rather would save all the users inputs and use them as it's own responses. 
Alright, so I found a way to solve this, but it may not be worth the computational cost. This is actually a fairly difficult Operations Research problem. Basically, this is a series of Pure [Integer Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_programming) Minimization Optimization problems. The BASIC psuedo code involves abstracting your data into an integer programming problem for each value, breaking apart the problem into smaller problems, simplifying each problem, solving each problem, and translating that solution back into the data. Because of the size of this, I am going to reply to your comment with each step. **So, the psuedo code:** &gt; Step 1. Convert each value combination into its own binary matrix. So for each date, you would have a 1 or a 0 if that data contained that value. So, for your example, you would have 2 matricies; one for "a, a" and one for "a, b" If you also had "b,a" and "b,b" you would need 2 more binary matrices. 
The first thing I wrote was an HTTP log analyzer that built a simple HTML page with graphical statistics. What amazed me was how easy it was to write, compared with the Perl version I'd worked on a long time. I ditched Perl then and there and never looked back. (This would be in 1996 or thereabouts.)
My very first software internship, I got introduced to create a PyQt GUI for a research lab's data management group. After I left I joined my university research group where the phD student wanted me to create a GUI to visualize his data. So I figured, I've done this before, lets do it in PyQt again! Little did I know that is a bad idea, especially after I found out that the data is 200MB and needed 3D visualization. I used pyqtgraph but it was so laggy it was basically non functional. But it was a really fun project when I didn't have too much experience in coding and if I could do it again I'd probably go with C++ :P
I made a program where you input the weight of some coins and then it estimates the total value. It just picked a random coin and added the weight of that coin until the weight exceeded the input weight.
Never going to happen. &gt; There are better languages that are completely free. If Python's documentation was half as good as Matlab's you might get some more adoption. But it's never going to go away. See COBOL and FORTRAN. You're also paying for stuff like the DO-178C, IEC61508 &amp; ISO26262 certification tools. Personally I don't want to fly or drive in something that some guy tossed up on Github in his free time.
&gt; Step 2. reshape each matrix to be days of week on as columns, and date range on the left. **Before, "a,a" matrix** Date|True/False :-:|:-: 1/1/17|1 1/2/17|1 1/3/17|0 1/4/17|1 **After** Date Range|M|T|W|R|F 1/1/17-1/5/17|1|1|0|1|0
I'm right now doing my first python project (a big one) with an angular 5 front end and I'm loving how everything connect. It's so easy to make an api with the endpoints decorators and I like how concise is the language.
&gt; Step 3. Break up into sections with content. If a row has nothing in it, it can't have a rule involving it. So, each matrix can be broken into smaller problems which are easier to solve. For example: **Before** Date Range|M|T|W|R|F :-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-: 1/1/17-1/5/17|1|1|0|1|0 1/8/17-1/12/17|0|0|0|0|0 1/15/17-1/19/17|1|1|0|1|0 **After** Date Range|M|T|W|R|F :-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-: 1/1/17-1/5/17|1|1|0|1|0 Date Range|M|T|W|R|F :-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-: 1/15/17-1/19/17|1|1|0|1|0 
Yeah I didn't have collisions in mine either. What integration method did you use? I hand-typed 4th order Runge Kutta in. Felt proud I put it inside a function to call later lol.
[reddit.subreddit.submissions()](http://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/code_overview/models/subreddit.html#praw.models.Subreddit.submissions)? /r/redditdev is probably best for stuff like this.
&gt; Step 4. Flatten the each matrix into a two column In this step you are reverting the data back into its old shape. A column for date and a column true/false
I made a web app with flask that loads a svn repo into a Postgres database and then displays it to users to see what changes have been committed. It also allows you to mark a commit as test and make comments. The neatest thing it does is displays links to the commuter files and by clicking on on pops up a diff. I need to finish it by adding LDAP. 
I made a program that syncs files between two filesystems based on how frequently you use them. The idea is that the files you use most frequently stay in your local filesystem for quick access and the files you use less frequently go to a slower external drive or network filesystem where you have more storage space. It basically lets you store your files on an external drive or server while caching the ones you use most frequently on your local filesystem. I actually decided to learn Python specifically for this project. While I had some programming experience coming into it, it still took me months to get working. Giving me something to slowly work towards, however, made learning Python so much fun. [Here's the project on GitHub.](https://github.com/lostatc/zielen).
Ages ago I wrote hook, a little program which would watch a pid and when it disappeared it'd execute a command. Made it because I would, say, run apt-get update and forget about it. I'd just hook a notify-send onto it.
So you're saying that I shouldn't put my credit card information into the bot? As in selenium isn't a secure place to input any information? Also, is doing direct HTTP requests illegal or just something that websites attempt to block. I apologize if that is a dumb question. I'm assuming it's the latter. How would I be able to implement NoScript and disable the loading of images in the automated testing software? Thanks for the help
An instagram Bot for my own use. It was a fun experiment through which I learned a lot!

I live in Chicago. There is a lot of 311 data availabe: potholes reported, street lights out, rat infestations, etc. I downloaded all of the data and start analyzing it to compare the city's aldermen. I've been to turn it into a website where the public can see how their alderman ranks.
&gt;Mozilla browsers support pipelining; however, it is disabled by default &gt;Google Chrome previously supported pipelining, but it has been disabled due to bugs and problems with poorly behaving servers What an awful article. Let's push our numbers to the highest and all competitors to the lowest.
Not using it at all. At home I'm running Debian Linux, not Windows. It has a QEMU VM set up to occasionally run things on Windows. At the office (where we do use Windows; we're a dot net shop) also not using it. Am using bash + tools (via Cmder) mostly instead of cmd.exe though. 
I'm going to try my hand at this soon. I already have some code for the 2 body problem, but I'm hoping to model the solar system or something. I'm planning on using a RK4(5) function I wrote for the integration.
Well, I've been doing it as a hobbyist for five years: It's a deep dark hole of a hobby. And I'm now writing a game engine for teaching people to make games with Python, so you know, sometimes there's a future in it.
That sounds considerably more complicated than mine was haha. From what I remember, I just worked out the overall gravitational pull given to each planet, and adjusted the velocity based on that. With a handful of planets it runs at 5-10fps, but it was about as inefficient as it possibly could be. Just found the [old code](https://pastebin.com/uL6c3nnJ) (from 2014 so don't judge) and ran it, here's one that ended in a collision :) https://i.imgur.com/E2y8iOI.png
Ben? 
I did this for 6 years, it's fun if that's your thing. 
The first interesting program I made was a text based RPG. I fell down the rabbit hole on that project for a few days. Never did implement the final boss fight that I had been planning on...I should revisit that. 
Sorry if this was the wrong place! thank you for the help! I had no idea how to word what I needed so I couldn't find anything on google.
I have it installed on my laptop but haven’t really used it. If I’m working on my Linux servers I’m usually on my MacBook. If I didn’t have that I’d use it daily. 
I had some success writing a [program in another language](https://github.com/jrheard/finance) that grabbed transaction data off [Mint](https://www.mint.com/), so Mint might be worth looking into if you haven't seen it before.
&gt; If Python's documentation was half as good as... I swear sometimes I'm reading the docs and I feel like I'm reading something Donald Trump wrote. There's words, but no information 
For matrix operations it's unrivaled. For programming it's unusable. For a large processing task I was using pandas but it was a bit slower than I liked (not a dis on pandas, it's awesome). I rewrote the same matrix operations in Matlab and it was ~30% faster. That was enough for me to break just that operation off until a Matlab script. The main control is still python, but that one piece is Matlab. Works great. 
No worries, just pointing you to another resource for asking basic questions in. In your case, the important bit is you're getting lines back from your read which will only match whole strings assert "red" not in ["1.red", "2. blue", "3. orange"] assert "red in "1.red" So you just need to grab every string inside your list and compare with in.
Nice, I do use mint. Thanks!
What I'm doing is pulling from a list of names at random, each on a separate line. I'm planning on using the program to randomly populate pubs, library's, etc. in DND. I want to have a random selection of towns people and use functions like checkFamily() to figure out how much a given character likes/dislikes my Pc's.
I made an afk farming bot for pubg
My senior year I took a very basic level programming class. I’m talking Scratch the whole time through. I had a bit of prior experience with Python. So my end of the year project was a turn-based combat text-based adventure. It was pretty basic, and not really any visuals, but one could collect items that were randomly generated and equip them to decrease the randomness of combat rolls. It wasn’t very impressive, but I was proud. 
The method expects (or PyCharm thinks it expects) an instance of `EventAPIOne` (i.e. an instance of a subclass of `Resource`), but you're passing it the class itself. In Python, classes are just objects of class `type`, which is why you're getting the error you do; you are, in fact, passing an instance of `type` instead of an instance of `EventAPIOne`. Try creating an `EventAPIOne` object and passing that in instead.
I did exactly the same with my friends. It also sent an email to another person with all the matches, so we can be sure nobody got picked twice
Do you mind sharing the source code?
Step 5. Create the integer problem parts for each set of data Integer problems are made up of 2 things: * A Cost Function * Constraints * Constraint matrix Your cost function is basically the number of rules ("groupings") you use. Your constraint values are the true/false column values we calculated earlier. The constraint matrix is a matrix of each possible rule as a column. Lets say we have this two week period: Date Range|Values :-:|:-: 1/1/2017(M)|1 1/2/2017(T)|1 1/3/2017(W)|0 1/4/2017(R)|1 1/5/2017(F)|0 1/8/2017(M)|1 1/9/2017(T)|1 1/10/2017(W)|0 1/11/2017(R)|1 1/12/2017(F)|0 For only a 2 week period, you would have 85 possible rules from my count. You could dynamically generate these because they're just patterns. rules are things like days 1-5, every monday and tuesday, etc. etc. **Math-wize, you would now have:** * R = a vector of the active rules which would be of size: *1* x *#of Rules*. This is what you are trying to solve for. it can only have values of 1 and 0 * Cost function = the sum of R. You are trying to minimize this. * Constraints matrix = a matrix of values for each rule. Should be of size: *# of days* x *# of rules* * Constraints values = which is the values column. like the values column in the table above. **EVERYTHING EXCEPT FOR THE COST FUNCTION SHOULD ONLY BE ABLE TO HAVE VALUES OF 1 OR 0**
It's built on asyncio and requires python 3. Would you still want to use gevent?
How long is this project taking you? I want to do exactly the same thing. I'm taking a class on language processing and sentiment analysis right now and am also super interested in trading - looking to get into making a bot with a different api (not enough $ for RH daytrading)

Headless Chrome refers to using Chrome in 'headless' mode, aka without starting the graphical user interface. Selenium doesn't require a graphical instance to operate, hence you can save time by not loading those elements and instead running just the needed parts. To use Chrome like this you'd call `chrome --headless` in a terminal, or use the chrome options (or chrome args, not sure right now) within your python code. Googling "chrome headless selenium" should definitely help further, but it is not hard to use.
&gt; Optional: Step 4B. Simplify integer program This problem has a lot of rows and columns. You can simplify it by eliminating every row that has a 0 for a constraint value and every column that had a 1 in a deleted row's constraint matrix. So if the third constraint value had a zero. You would remove that row in the constraint values and constraint matrix. You would also remove every rule in the constraints matrix involving that row. This in combination with memoization would significantly improve the speed of this algorithm
You introduced me to Django! I've now built 3 web apps. Thanks! 
you can use threads OR ayncio + aiohttp 
&gt; Step 5 Solve each problem. I haven't had to do integer programming with python before, but I am certain there are libraries out there for it. Improving the IP part of Scipy is on the Scipy developer ToDo list. Basically, you would call a function that is the IP solver and pass the constraint values, constraint matrix, and the cost function. Run it, and get your values back. 
A minecraft map installer for my little brother who could build amazing things but just could not understand the concept of copying and pasting. I had zero knowledge of programming, read the first chapters of 'Learn Python the Hard Way' and just went with it. It had a nice gui, was packaged into an executable and even had a backup feature. It consisted of several functions and was neatly confined into exactly two .py files. Yeah I never want to find the source code for that ever again.
I am going to play around with this for a bit. I can currently generate my spot color plates via FPDF on separate pages, which is effective on one of the output devices. I will try and define the printable information utilizing your idea with ReportLab. I do have a device that is looking for color information specifically, but I've only had success with EPS DCS 2.0. Thanks for the tip Cap'n.
&gt; Step 6. Create the JSON object from each active rule and submit it to the API. You will need to take each rule which is a grouping of dates, convert that into the JSON object, provide it with the values for that matrix, and submit the result to the API &gt; Summary: This algorithm, in my professional opinion, is a pain in the ass. Its very possible that its not worth it. It may not speed up the process. I can't prove that, but I suspect it. Its definitely hard to maintain and difficult to build. Either way, good luck and if you're still interested in this, I would be happy to help. Just message me and we can work together on it.
Using threads I can use two functions at once?
Kind of. That's how it will appear.
I'll take a look at it. Thanks!

I’m working on making a bit for purchasing sneakers (because if you can’t beat em join em). I’m having trouble with adidas website as well as figuring out how to automate it for certain drop days. I am pretty inexperienced so this could be a pretty easy fix. Any help is welcome!
Holy cow... first of all brilliant! Thank you so much for the idea and for affirming I'm not a completely terrible coder for not having come up with it. haha You're right, of course, from an economical point there's absolutely no way this algorithm should be implemented in our process... the development cost would never come close to touching the 1 second gain we might find ever few weeks. That all being said... when I have some downtime I'm definitely going to try and implement this on a small scale... because it's a fascinating problem! Thanks again for the effort, I'll let you know how it turns out!
I ported a program I had on Auto Hot Key (AHK) that was a GUI that took newly downloaded TV shows from a drop folder on my computer and moved them into my Media Center folder on the network. I ported it to Python so that I could include other additions, such as interfacing with my downloading program's API. Without this, I had to manually remove it from the active downloads list before I could run my AHK file and have the videos moved. Now, it auto removes the files from within that program then performs the move all automatically.
Thanks! That's actually pretty close to what I have now.
I did this except I told somebody and shortly after I got promoted. I'm currently on my 5th iteration of this process (3rd iteration involved leveraging those initial promotions for a job at a better paying company). I still get to fuck off quite a bit, to boot.
At my old job as a grunt at a well known corporation I was in a department of people who verified product data coming in from business awards/ contracts and entered it into at minimum 5 systems that you interface with on an intranet site. SO example supply chain, eCommerce, SKU creation, legal, sales locations, pricing as well as COGS, weights and measurements for trucking, basically my job to ensure everything was entered correctly. I was basically underpaid glue! ALL this data was provided to me from multiple sources via excel or csv files. After enough time I had a light bulb moment that as I was learning Python on the side I started making scripts to read the files, then i learned about the magic of Selenium and Chrome driver and made massive scripts to read the excel file, navigate the correct webpages and compare data entered vs. what i was provided. If it didn't jive I had different versions to over-ride information I knew to be correct or to prompt me to double check the data. It got me 2 bonuses and a raise (maybe 2 if you consider I was performing at lightning speed and made myself look hardworking). Eventually I got tired of trying to explain to everyone why my way was better, passed the script to a few people to let them play with it. At my last few days the script did some major damage by inputting data from wrong lines into the wrong places. It was fixed with about 40 hours of total employee overtime by manual intervention. I was told if i wasn't such a high functioning employee that was leaving I might have been walked out the building that day. To this day I regret nothing! TLDR: Had a manual grunt job validating data. Automated reading excel files and comparing data to GUIs in intranet browsers, profit pursured, got bored decided to move on, last few days chaos ensued and they almost walked me out due to the damage. I regret nothing!
I got into scientific computer by doing a research project on the population of Lion Fish in the US Virgin Islands for a BioMath class. It was cool to take my math knowledge and translate it to code.
It's a hack but could use pyautogui. 1. Click on the taskbar to switch to application 2. Perform simulated user clicks 3. Switch back to previous application (alt-tab?)
Lol... that’s what because of my previous job. When I got there everything was pen and paper so properly tracking inventory and such was an absolute nightmare... I ended up automatic 90% of my day with VBA and Powershell
There's a button for that y'know
Mmm...it's been about a month, only able to do it part time. I figure maybe another month, give or take, before I'm content with turning it on officially. There are a couple more machine learning features that I want to implement, and those are the ones that take the longest.
oh I definitely did this until I got bored and found a new job. deleted my scripts, they're probably doing the same processes by copy and paste now.
This one: https://github.com/alanbernstein/treemonger
Fantastic for testing, I develop mostly for AWS but I run Windows and being able to test things locally is so convenient.

Are you hosting the script publicly on github? If so, do you mind sharing a link to it?
duuuude. thats impressive. Have a blog or anything we can follow?
A small psychometric test scoring assistant... I was thinking on doing a full assistant for a hard test to score (visual-motor evaluation) but at the moment, with no coding skills i tought i should start with something simpler, so i did that little assistant for a anxiety test. Still remember the excitment to make it read the right values from an excel spreadsheet.
A compiler for an OPS-5 style production rule language that created as output an optimized SQL schema that could be fed into SQLite to create that production rule system. It built a Rete net for the system with tables as nodes and triggers as edges, and calculated a minimal covering index set to ensure every query was maximally covered. It also had an expression optimzer that would synthesize columns in nodes to store precomputed values used in the predicates, and also did alpha pruning and the like. The upshot was that you got a production rule system that ran wherever SQLite ran, and with all the associated safety guarantees, etc. It ended up getting a DARPA grant. That was a lot of fun. 
&gt; So you're saying that I shouldn't put my credit card information into the bot? As in selenium isn't a secure place to input any information? No, I mean if you had it running on a remote VPS. Aside from it presumably being stored in plaintext (and thus easier for somebody to get if you get trojaned), there's no extra risk when you're running it locally. &gt;Also, is doing direct HTTP requests illegal or just something that websites attempt to block. I apologize if that is a dumb question. I'm assuming it's the latter. Definitely not illegal, just something that could potentially be flagged. I know bots are popular for a lot of clothing and shoe sites, so I'm guessing some of these vendors turn a blind eye to this behavior anyway. It's just something worth being aware of. &gt; How would I be able to implement NoScript and disable the loading of images in the automated testing software? It's been a little while since I used Selenium, but you should be able to specify the browser profile that it uses. The browser will load up any of the settings and extensions associated with that profile just as it would when launched normally.
Last summer I took a Python elective for my B.S. in C.S. and we had to come up with a project idea that leveraged modules, persistence and packaging so I put together a console based Hangman game, then enhanced it to include a GUI, and created executables for Mac, Windows and Linux using PyQT4 and PyInstaller. For the persistence piece I used SQLite, loaded a default dictionary for the game, and allowed users to load their own dictionaries from a comma-delimited text file. I also used it for recording which words from the dictionary had already been used in the game session, and saving the players' scores for serving the top 5 scores in a separate scoreboard window. Honestly the funnest programming project I've come up with from scratch!
Wow, this seems pretty cool. Care to share the code?
It can be done, yes. Malicious code can be hidden in plain sight.
Lol thanks
That code is similar but I rather not show that code around yet. Basically you do exactly what I did in that code, with fewer objects, and iterate over a time range
I want to be able to use my computer while the script's running, which is why this is what I'm trying to do :(
Damn is there no way at all? I just want to be able to use my computer while it's running
Is a 30% performance boost really worth maintaining two ecosystems?
That is what I did. I also do plan on using a client. See it doesn't just read a python file. It parses json data if you run python bot --update-bot. It gets information written to a database. Also have been planning on switching to full json, only problem is not everyone has web connectivity, hence why I added the python file. If you would like, you can add your own custom code.
A script that sends me an email with a random generated string after I turn on my laptop. I might allow it to change the password.
My current employer is actively moving away from matlab and going for python 
Please let me see this code! I have to organise ss each year. I made a random script but yours sounds way better. 
It is definitely a really interesting problem. Took me a few hours to figure out how to set it up as a solvable problem and then add a few things that would speed it up. I might also try to build it for fun. I'm doing the whole job search thing right now, so I might hold off till things settle down. Definitely let me know how it goes when you build it. I would build this thing in the reverse order of the steps or at least plan the build in the reverse order. Definitely use a library like numpy to manipulate the data. I think step 3 and 4B are cool ways to speed up the algorithm, but you don't "Strictly" need them. Let me know if you find a good IP solver for python. It would be good to know about
I totally get that thanks for sharing what you could.
There's an awesome article called "how to write a neural net in 11 lines of python". When I was first diving into machine learning I used that as a template to take sentiment data and try to 'train' (just wanted to make input output work) a neural net for sentiment prediction. Turned the words into numpy arrays where each word was a sum of its ascii numbers in the array. Gave each array an estimated rating of 1-10 5 being neutral 10 being positive. 
I first started learning programming in general and python specifically in college when I started doing research with a professor in bioinformatics. Being new to programming, my programs were slow and not optimized, and working in data science, they were large and going to take a lot of time even when they were optimized. Basically, I always had time to kill after I hit 'run'. Rather than being tied to the computer for 20 or so minutes or hours or days, and rather than checking in constantly in, I decided to make it send an sms message to my phone when the program was done. I found my phones sms 'email address' (I only know about this working with US phones), made a gmail account, and wrote a program to login to gmail and send an email to my phone, which would receive it as an sms. When the program completed, it would call a send_sms(message) function, and text me. I had made other programs by this time, but this was the first program that was made to solve a problem I had, rather than for work. 
Yes, asyncio sucks.
For most cases I agree it's not worth it, for this specific etl it made a huge difference. For matrix operations you're not iterating over a series or list. You aggregate that set into a single object then apply an operation to that single object. Huge performance boost between those two approaches, can still fully be done within pandas. I think Matlab strength is memory to performance. I'm saturating memory for this particular calculation, I suspect pandas is crippled but the underlying c library that it leverages for matrix operations. Matlab has been tuned for that purpose as opposed to the flexibility python offers Also, fuck Matlabs loop operators. Might as well not support it. 
I've suggested this to my family but they like the tactile feel of drawing from a hat. However, my father-in-law doesn't like getting the same person (me) for 4 years straight.
Ah! For mine, I’m sure nobody got picked twice because of the way I wrote it. But just in case, I can always check the sent box of the email I used to message everyone.
Not yet, but the project is on github in various states of disarray. https://github.com/ppb/pursuedpybear Sometime this month I'm getting the event system working (Or so I keep telling myself). I give tutorials based on it a handful of times a year (And I've submitted it to PyCon). That's on my personal github: https://github.com/pathunstrom/game-tutorial.
Is the idea that you don’t want students to be in the same group with the people they were with last time? Mine is basically just “shuffle until conditions are met.” So for you, you just need a way to check whether the shuffle meets your needs and keep reshuffling until it does. For low N and few conditions, this works just fine!
A script that processed the downloaded html pages for a blog I wanted to backup: It removed all scripts, non-content and interactive parts, inserted comments beyond the "load more comments" limit, downloaded images and fixed relative URLs. The downloading of the pages was done with a bash script and some regexes, but manipulating html with bash would be ridiculous, and I figured it was a good opportunity to practice python. It's still the only python I've written outside of the uni subject I learned it for.
Ill be looking for the update of how it goes!
Sure it's here: https://github.com/ggetzie/homebin/blob/master/whowin I realized it doesn't really tell you anything in the event the two seeds are equal, but for somehow this wasn't an issue. I guess I just picked the name I liked more for those ones.

you mean if the window is not selected but your mouse still exists over it? or do you mean that the app will register clicks even if mouse is not over window? if it's the last pynput will work and if it's the former depending on which graphical lib you use you have to get the window size and position and only accept clicks if mouse is within the window.

An analytics bot for a slack team. Slack is crazy expensive and our club existed on slack and started getting pretty big. I was in charge of finances and the leadership asked me to purchase a paid tier so we could get analytics info... Seeing as our funding was 500 dollars a year, this was not possible. So I spent 3 months learning python, learning SQL db structure, learning how websockets worked and how to run a server. Took a lot of effort, but it was worth it in the end
The madman cant keeping get away with this
According to [the Wikipedia article on http pipelining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_pipelining#Implementation_in_web_browsers) there isn't *any* major web browser that supports http pipelining. So i'm not sure what the usecase would be for this framework...
3,141 lines into writing a memory editing bot for my favouite mmorpg. I love Python, it is so much fun. 
The other team members may not have what they need to run the scripts on their windows machines. For most python isn't installed in the first place.
Docker is ok, but I wouldn't get to attached to it. Docker allows an image to root the host machine, so you will never be allowed to use it in certain environments like HPC or anything where the person running containers is untrusted. Conda (+ bash on windows where applicable) is a nice solution in these cases because it requires no special security arrangements or permissions.
Can you compile linux executables on windows so that they will run on an actual ubuntu or fedora or whatever linux installation? 
Hey, nice to see you here! You taught me how to use Django so that I wouldn't disappoint in my job. I've also been following your GTA V machine learning experiment, which is awesome.

For my capstone project I wrote something using numpy &amp; pandas to do clustering of lizards based on some classifiers in a geographic region for my professor. Way way way more fun and doable in Python than Matlab would ever be.
&gt; There's words, but no information It's documentation written for developers not users. There's a huge difference.
I learned python a few years ago. A year after I learned, my boss said that they wanted us to keep a certain amount of moves in the building. Moves relate to moving product via work functions on the warehouse floor. He also wanted our problem area lower than a certain amount. I created a simple script that logged into access (which our company still uses for some reason). It then got information then printed it out to console. We put this on a big screen in our office. We used the script to keep track of how things were going during the day.

if it's a web app, you can use Selenium. Otherwise the only solution is to actually have your script take control of your mouse and make clicks which will obviously change which windows will have focus.

Flask apps to track expenses
Yeah I've been messing around with some of the open source home automation platforms (Home Assistant) and it allows python scripting to be done and you can control your whole house. I always wonder how many parents have programmed their children to do chores, I have never seen anyone admit to it on the forums. It's probably good I don't have kids, my house would be a Skinner box.
Pypodder, a python version of the pure AppleScript ipodder script by Adam Curry. It later was the engine under the hood for iPodderX, the first desktop podcast client. 
I coded a perceptron for one of my classes. It ransomly generated an array of n x coordinates, then an array of y coordinates. For each [x,y] couple, a very simple line of code checked if it was inside or outside of a triangle that I defined in the parameters thanks to the summits' coordinates. Then the perceptron "learned" from all these points, generated two other array of coordinates, and based *only* on the coordinates of each points, thanks to the learning it had done, tried to infer if it was inside our outside of the triangle. *This was a beautifully useless script in the end*, but coding it was a lot of fun, and it worked soooo well. By adjusting the parameters I managed to get a very low percentage of mistakes :) 
So in the program i just write: game={} for i in range(0, NBofPLAYER): name=input("Name of player : ") game[name]=*calls the function to draw 7 cards and return the list of card drawn* and there I go ?
Yep, that'll work
I think you want this one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf-BqAjZb8M

I'm writing a medical lab application which produces chemical dependency (addiction) reports with ReportLab. It uses genetic data. I am not a geneticist. The geneticist is not a programmer. It took several stressful conversations to finally come to a conclusive answer on how to get from data input to the printed report. At least we made it!
I meant only sometimes. The docs can be vague, or confusing, or not written in plain language sometimes. That's why there are stackoverflow posts that explain what x function does.
Ta :-) 
Thanks!
It wouldn't be too hard to add NEON extensions to the library.
Possibly. If it can be done, it will be done.
Upvote for the simile
It has uses outside of web browsing. In app development, you could have a japronto API that your app knows how to communicate with. It wouldn't be open to normal web traffic.
I will check that out! Thanks for the reply!
My first program that wasn't for one of the classes I took to learn... A package tracking script that used a shipping company's API to grab updated tracking info for several thousands of packages of equipment and write to our database. Then I added a flask front-end so leadership could see the table of shipments color coded based on status.
This project was discussed half a year ago. The benchmark has two crucial problems: * HTTP pipelining (no one uses that in reality). * Was tested without any python logic inside request haldler (almost pure C). 
Literally every application other than a web browser. The internet has plenty of business oriented uses that web browsers don't need to be designed for.

Same result from there. You get the task in the bottom right task list status bar. It looks like it takes 4 (long) attempts before timing out. I can't fully ready the line, but that's what it's doing. At a guess whatever it is, isn't respecting the proxy settings.

Hey this is how I ended up getting into VBA. I tried to convert to python but the Excel tools aren't nearly as robust as in VBA (which is understandable).
This is a rich topic, and you should have a look at twisted, websockets, and asyncio. Here are a couple of relevant links: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8248577/socket-2-way-communication-in-python https://learn-gevent-socketio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sockets.html 
Well I actually did figure out a way to print a number from 1-6 once the user randomly picks it, but I found some different code on github. So it's okay since I already figured it out.
Have you tried numpy arrays? No experience with that, shooting into the blue
Wow, thanks for he doubt! I can feel my mind growing more hungry for knowledge!
Call me crazy, but plagiarizing (otherwise known as cheating or stealing) someone else's code is not going to help you learn anything except how to fail spectacularly at life. I you would have made an effort to actually learn something, instead of just asking for someone to "post the code", people would be much more helpful. Instead, you wanted to have someone else do the work, while you pass it off as your own work. Its dishonest and shows shitty work ethic and lack of morals. I think your career advisor gave you the wrong advice. Should've been a politician.
I had a spreadsheet of sites that were to be demolished for a client. As part of the bid package, I created a KML based on the data. 
Be sure to check out Jupyter, pandas, and mathplotlib. 
Pandas is built on top of numpy, it would be the same implimentation. 
I automated significant parts of a large and complicated process, so that it took hours instead of more than a week. I got a pat on the back and a feature in the company newsletter. I asked to be more involved in the process of process of creating the tools used by our group, and was basically told that I should leave such things to the programmers upstairs. They have formal training in programming, but are so removed from the processes they are programming for that everything comes out half-baked, poorly implemented, and still requires the user to do everything by hand. Simple requests made to them get pushed months down the line, and anything harder than that simply doesn't happen unless someone in upper management decides that they need it right now. -------------------- Man, I needed that rant. My new Selenium web query just finished, so we'll call it productive time. Now to start interpreting the output so that we can stop wading through all this shit by hand.
I had a very messy /Downloads folder so i did this python script to sort everything into each respective folder /VIdeos /Images /Documents etc, based on extension ending ('.mkv', 'mp4, etc..)
Yeah I think I can do that but the email part as well is really nice addition, I'd like to do it with a text message, but your code would be really useful if you didn't mind messaging me it that would be really awesome of you! Just trying to learn! 
Yeah, ofc I made sure that nobody got picked twice in the code too. It's just another confirmation
Tripped over the words a bit there, but you’re right 
You can also be less uptight y'know
I coded the game “Avalon” (based on the board game “The Resistance”) so that my college friends and I could play it on the bus home for breaks. Of course, by the time I got it all working, most of them didn’t take the bus anymore, but I’m still proud of it. It’s kinda the only interesting thing I’ve ever done with Python of my own volition...
Its my current prog really. Its a little platformer game that's currently a mess of dirty hacks and spaghetti, but it features menus implemented with finite state systems and level generation and just a load of stuff ive found interesting compared to the shit they teach you at the start. I might rewrite it again eventually to use even more "proper" conventions like vectors and stuff, and maybe polish it into a complete game:)
"Learn to automate the boring stuff with python", baby!
Convincing. 
Perhaps something like this would work: class ShadowAttrs: def __init__(self, value, **attrs): self._value = value self._attrs = attrs def __getattr__(self, name): if name in self._attrs: return self._attrs[name] return getattr(self._value, name) def __setattr__(self, name, value): if name in {'_value', '_attrs'}: return super().__setattr__(name, value) self._attrs[name] = ShadowAttrs(value) def __repr__(self): return repr(self._value) machine = ShadowAttrs(0) machine.Foo = [0, 1] machine.Foo.X = [2048, 2042] machine.Foo.coeffs = [2048, 2043] You would have to implement pretty much all of the dunder methods to get everything to be completely transparent since python skips calls to `__getattr__` and `__getattribute__` in C code for performance reasons. Of course, just because you can do something that doesn't mean you should. If you do this you might get a neater syntax, but you will likely confuse everyone who tries to use it because it breaks expectations of the way python is supposed to work. I'd recommend just using a more mundane structure.
I wrote a data profiler application that works against SQL Server, Teradata, Sybase, or comma-delimited files, and produces a nice Excel workbook of metrics.
Here's the original discussion on /r/python when it was first submitted: https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/5r83q3/a_journey_to_make_python_with_http_screaming_fast/ /u/squeaky_pl talks about rewriting it in Rust in the comments to the Medium article, which is pretty funny. Maybe that's why he seem to have abandoned the project? HTTP/2 support seems like an obvious addition since pipelining plays such a big part in the performance. I think it's nice to see someone that thinks about performance to the point of using SSE and thinking about cache misses. That's what libraries are supposed to do, make it fast so every user benefits.
What's the most overly complicated "hello world!" program you can make?
Uckfacefay.py. It took any sentence and translated it into Piglatin. It was terribly inefficient, converting strings into list arrays then removing array[x] to the end of the word via some variables then adding "ay". Some if statements along the lines of '&gt;if list.[x] == " " ' to determine the ends of words. It was really messy but it worked and never failed. I also made a weighted gpa calculator for school that I was super proud of but that's not interesting. 
No it's asyncio. The gevent interop is poor
 # noinspection PyTypeChecker If you control the definition you can also just swap ```x: Foo``` for ```x: Type[Foo]``` (importing Type from typing).
You know I don’t know. CDT definitely does. I honestly think that’s the only way to use the boost preprocessor without turning into a homicidal maniac. I really like jetbrains stuff, but CDT is still way better. 
I used Tasker and autoinput to call Shazam on my phone and identify music that I'm listening to. Once the song is identified it posts to a web server running in my basement which save the artist and song name to a text file. I wrote a python script to parse that text file every minute if it has changed. It searches YouTube for the audio version of the song and rips it to MP3. That processes the MP3 against an acoustID database to identify the song artist and album. After it's identified it moves it to the correct directory structure on my NAS and uploads it automatically to Google Music. Finally, it pushes a notification to my phone saying that the song has been grabbed and is now available. Pretty ambitious for my first script but it works flawlessly.
I was into the lottery when I began python, and attempted to make a program to predict winners. I made a program that took all lottery drawings, and graphed out frequency of numbers, pairs, triplets etc. It also analysed every possible combo that had not been a winner yet. I did find out some interesting things. There really are numbers and groups of numbers that are more frequent, and others that are the opposite. I found that most of the time, a lottery drawing would have 2 or 3 "hot numbers", 2 or 3 "neutral" numbers, and less than 50% of the time 1 or 2 "cold numbers". Since the "neutral" numbers made up about 70% of all numbers, it became clear that there is no way to predict a jackpot for the lottery. It was interesting to see this in statistical terms though. I did however, get really well versed with manipulating lists and dictionaries.
I don't buy it that people don't want pipelining, it seems to me that the problem lies in how issues like https://github.com/requests/requests/issues/1394 are treated in our community. HTTP Pipelining is far from complicated in the protocol level code like this. And the lack of it is one of the main reasons I can't use HTTP between my microservices. 
You were almost a Paul Sandwich!
Here's my spaghetti code. It is kinda hard to follow because I just whipped it up and didn't pay much attention to structure or readability. Sorry!

An IRC chat bot. Some Streamers on Twitch do giveaways based on viewtime. Twitch chats are basically IRC chats and I build a script that automatically checks if a set of streamers is online. When they are the not can automatically join and farm the view time. Never really used it though. I just liked the idea.
For one-offs, grabbing a CSV from Mint.com is definitely easiest. If you want to pull that data in an automated fashion, you have a few options. Most banks provide the ability to download your transactions in [ofx](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Financial_Exchange) format (sometimes called “Quicken format” since that’s its most popular use). Beware, some banks charge extra for the privilege. There are a few APIs out there like http://openbankproject.com/ and [Plaid](https://plaid.com/products/transactions/), but they tend to have non-hobby-friendly pricing and not support all banks, so YMMV.

I don’t think any of my programs are interesting in what they do. The times that I feel real pride is when I get a really efficient/clever way to do something. Bonus if it’s on someone else’s program.
 &gt;I also made a program that provided fake data to submit to my boss... something I don’t recommend but oh well Sounds like there could be a story there.... want to share?
A patient manageger, and a portfolio of websites... both in flask.
Did you try [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf)?
Source code : print "Hello World"
That sounds awesome! Got any pictures?
Just a few hours ago I was working on a group project with a classmate and we realize we'd have to re-project hundreds of shapefiles. I wrote a quick python script to batch process them and the look on my classmates face when I told him what I was doing was pretty great.
isn't eth using solidity?
I've never used it but there is plenty of activity in the commit history: https://github.com/kennethreitz/pipenv/commits/master and plenty of releases recently: https://github.com/kennethreitz/pipenv/releases 
I created a program to monitor a satellite downlink from earth observation satellites. I wasn't much of a coder by my current standards, so it was pretty shocking. It also had to integrate with some pre-existing components written in Perl, so writing the interface between those was pretty fun.
I know this sounds harsh, but have you googled it? There are at least 3 supreme bots I found on github in a couple of minutes. One of them is python. They should give you ideas what other people are doing. https://github.com/loks0n/supremedropbot &lt;-- python https://github.com/kfichter/OpenATC https://github.com/Paulowarren31/Supreme-Bot 
What exactly am I supposed to be looking at on that page?
i prefer [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) with virtualenv plugin and [pip-tools](https://github.com/jazzband/pip-tools) to manage requirements and version pinning. pipenv tries to do too much for my taste.

Do you know I took it apart so that I can incorporate it into a mission control play desk for my children. If I ever get that done I'll make a post about it.

Have you been beaten by your own AI? I've always thought if the AI was based on algorithms that you designed, then you'd always be able to beat it because you have the same knowledge plus creative thinking.
an exposure calculator
Hm, and no other package does the job of doing matrix operations efficiently well? I would guess that this is a quite common use case... not doubting you, just curious bc our company wants to move away from matlab
I worked with a guy like that. One they figured it out they eliminated his position and moved him elsewhere in the company. 
it was designed to play against other AIs (by me and others) that implemented various algorithms and techniques, so I haven't played it directly, but I'm pretty confident I wouldn't beat it. sure I know in theory what it's doing, but that's outweighed by its computed forethought. my brain can't keep up 
You will never be able to do as much with Vba as you can do with python. The community is everything. Having modules to import to make your job easier is awesome. 
I setup something that sounds sketchy but works pretty well for most http requests between micro services. It is essentially a gateway API that has a base view set to make each request type which is then used anytime you need to make a request to a given micro service. For each method say create you pass the received data into a requests.post object then return the response data and status blindly. This way whenever you implement this base viewset all you have to do is define the desired microservice endpoint. User validation happens at the gateway and an apikey is passed on each request from the gateway to the given microservice. I’m on my phone and vsts is a dick but could put an example up here if you want.

A codon list maker with three nested for loops. [codons!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_codon_table) are 3-character entities that map to amino acid identities. An RNA molecule specifies a protein's amino acid sequence this way.
**DNA codon table** The genetic code is traditionally represented as an RNA codon table because, when proteins are made in a cell by ribosomes, it is mRNA that directs protein synthesis. The mRNA sequence is determined by the sequence of genomic DNA. With the rise of computational biology and genomics, most genes are now discovered at the DNA level, so a DNA codon table is becoming increasingly useful. The DNA codons in such tables occur on the sense DNA strand and are arranged in a 5' → 3' direction. There is the existence of symmetrical and asymmetrical characteristics in genetic codes. *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Python/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^| [^Donate](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/donate) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28
I made a random number generator that exported the values into an excel spreadsheet. The spreadsheet would be used by customers to validate our product was made the way they wanted. Often times the product would be odd by 1-2% and it was annoying to do the paperwork so I made a program to make it seem like every hint was fine. Yes its unethical but I learned my lesson 
Data has so much more to reveal, and contributions from people like you have have opened doors that are hard for folks to get through. Thanks for all you do. 
And that was the day that you learned the value of not using USBs to store the only copy of anything, and also to hang a good backup of your files.
Hah, awesome to hear :)
Thanks! I've learned tons by making the content.
Cool! What do the apps do?
What's an angular 5 in regards to the front end?
Currently doing chatbots with deep learning, if you're interested. Hopefully this weekend I'll release the next batch and we'll have some models to train.
Thank you for the kind words!
Got any good python for Excel resources?
Was it ever? I’m not sure I get the rationale for using it. I maintain my own virtualenvs for building packages and use setuptools.
 I'm currently working on a game with which i will eventually propose to my girlfriend in 2 or so years
You're claiming you wrote the website for Vogue in python?
A google app engine RESTful API and a webapp.
There isn't, though. The button means "I believe this post contributes to the conversation." That's it. Which is why, personally, posts like "this made my day," "this made me laugh out loud," "this is the truest thing I've seen all week," or even, "best comment" don't bother me. They're an elaboration of how the comment was specifically appreciated by someone else. If you don't agree that it contributes to the discussion then, well, there *is* a button for that.
&gt; For me, there's some crazy draw towards playing with "data" that I just can't explain. That's what's always driven me to learn programming. That’s peak Sentdex right there! I love your work, man. It’s always my go-to when I feel like I’m ready to tackle a new facet in python or when I feel like I’m not grasping something fully and need another perspective on it. Working through the Django tuts now! Keep up the excellent work. The python community owes you a great deal of gratitude. 
That's actually a pretty useful project for many people. Great idea!
`SyntaxError: Missing parentheses in call to 'print'. Did you mean print("Hello World")?` 
I started something similar many years ago with the same idea. I stopped though after my now wife proposed to me instead!
A selenium craigslist repost we for the laptops and whatnot I had for sale. 
Output: Hello World $ python -V Python 2.7.14 
I did not know it existed until this post, it might end up being the one windows store app I use.
What sort of data are you monitoring and what do you do with it?
I think it is much better to use the pathlib module. It covers pretty much everything around paths and file and directory operations with a really nice API. 
Would you be kind enough to break down the process you followed? The resources you used and the steps you had to take before finally being able to write such a program?
Exactly. The project after that one has about 30 backups, on 4 different flash drives, and saved to my google docs 
&gt; Checking primality efficiently is cool I probably didn't do it efficiently. I'm just an occasional hobbyist programmer who never got beyond Calc I in my math education. 
I think you mean: print("Hello world") ;)
I generally just use pyenv &amp; pip-tools to create a virtualenv and pin requirements.
Netcat was not allowed where I worked (or at least I got the impression it wasn't at the time). So I made a replacement with Python. It made use of [select](https://docs.python.org/3/library/select.html).
Pretty cool use of multiple technologies to achieve something useful. Great idea!
To be fair, sometimes it's still and interesting program.
Haha, yep, that sounds familiar. Luckily I've learned from others past mistakes in regards to backups and not my own. I worked IT support in the arts department at a university many years ago. I've had more than one post grad in tears after they discovered that the single floppy disk that they'd saved the entire thesis on suddenly didn't work anymore after spending months bouncing around in their bags/pencil cases.
theres a Magic Box module on pip
Battling against other AI sounds cool. Is that something you do with your friends, or is there a club for that sort of competition?
That's my point. Should quote example code which works with the latest version of python.
Kind of light on the testing there. What is your methodology for building this library?
I made a guessing game for the python keywords. It kept track of guesses, didn't count off for guessing the same wrong thing twice. Had a cheat and hint system, gave 'trophies' for doing certain good things, and 'taunts' when not doing good.
Jeez guys this is too expensive. 
Made a program that would email me a summary of the top 10 links from the past 24 hours from a series of subreddits that I had set.
A neural network from scratch as part of my AI cirriculum. I was sweating the whole time I wrote it and didn't care too much about it then because I was more worried about getting a good grade. But then I went back and played around with it and realized how cool neural nets were. Good times!
omg you just saved my ass, I've been very very impatiently waiting for AoC for literally 2 months...and I've been thinking it starts TOMORROW night all these weeks leading up to it...and I saw your post 13 minutes before it began and I managed to score points for the first time and I'm way unreasonably excited about it. You are my hero for alerting me to my near disastrous misunderstanding of calendars.
But we were talking about our first time. So, I think that was right thing to do probably.
I leant python just to write a program to get notification when my apc ups switches to battery from mains. I have it connected to raspberry pi and install apcupsd to monitor it. The python script runs every minute and send me a notification when the ups switches from mains to battery and vice versa.
Some thoughts: - it would be good to highlight the advantages/disadvantages of using this of multiprocessing. Do this in the README and first page of RTD so that it is front and center - Put a usage example on the README and have examples on the RTD page. An example of using FunctionAsync would be good, since it has the API done. - Your RTD API is incomplete 
I made something similar where I will get notification on my phone whenever any post in a specific subreddit gets certain up votes.
You could have been right if I was talking about python3 :) In python2 that syntax is right AFAIK.
Oh I know, I was playing the part of the pretentious programmer "correcting" your obvious mistake at a hello world.
Oh I didn't knew that. XD 
If you're using Python 3, I see no reason (in the 95% of cases) to use anything but `pyenv install 3.x; python -m venv venv`
I made a script that runs through a user-provided excel sheet of categories and their descriptions, assigns category IDs based on existing category ids, else it incrementally assigns a new ID, then adds them to a database. Boring and very specific to my job, but this script dropped a 4+ hour task to 1 minute and I learned a ton about Pandas in the process. It's the first real script I've ever made and I feel way more comfortable with python now! 
Do you know what BLAS implementations were being used? I'm guessing that Matlab was using Intel MKL and numpy was using the default BLAS and LAPACK; in which case you'd probably get similar performance if you switched the BLAS library in numpy. Here's a blog post on it on the topic - ["Boosting numpy: Why BLAS Matters"](http://markus-beuckelmann.de/blog/boosting-numpy-blas.html).
I actually agree that I didn't find codeacademy that helpful either when getting started. For all his flaws, I think Zed Shaw's approach in LPTHW of trying to get you more familiar with the shell before writing your first line of code is spot on, as it gets one to begin understanding the environment in which they'll be coding in "the real world". I don't think providing someone with only the facts as to how a language's syntax and semantics work is enough for a beginner. It's important to give them an idea of the process of coding (engaging their procedural memory) as much as it is to teach them how to code itself (declarative memory), which is something most online learning platforms aren't well-equipped to do, IMO.
need to learn more about that guy!
A way to do this with less fuss is to link your excel file to a database like MySQL (there is an excel addin for it) and use the relivant python library. There is also a VBA wraper for [SQLite for excel](https://github.com/SQLiteForExcel)
It's a framework for single page apps. It allows you to make a website without asking the server to give you a full page every time you click a link, declaring routes in client, and has some pretty directives (e.g *ngFor repeats the HTML element for each item in an array). The result is a website that feels like an app, like facebook, discord, slack, etc..
Have you tried using SciPy, specifically Sparse?
numpy is by far the best. its not that it does a bad job, its that Matlab does a fantastic job. Even comparing R to matlab there is a performance difference in many situations. there is a reason matlab is $500, its certainly not because its an easy to use program.
Have you tried using SciPy, specifically Sparse?
Can you give a simple example of such an operation that is slower with numpy?... I’d love to see it as a personal challenge to find a fast implementation in python
You can bet I watched these as soon as they were released :) I do enjoy them, and, I really am suprised by the quality of your results!
Well, there is always the possibility to use a virtual machine in which you can run your automation. This doesn’t affect the applications you’re using on your “main machine”.. 
Wrote a GIMP plugin to convert Unreal 2 models to UT2004. GIMP uses python for scripting.
Ha...one of my first interesting ones was a script that audited two OracleDBs for replication. It spit out a list of tables and users that didn't match so we could either drop them or enable replication.
Perfect timing. I needed it right now
I have also felt this burn.
I'm a software developer that often works with ROS (Robot Operating System). I guess the most interesting "program" has so far been a ROS node that turns the head motion captured from an Oculus Rift into servo motor motions for a pan-tilt head with a stereo camera and publishes the images of the stereo cam to the displays of the Rift. Remote stereo-vision. A 3D telepresence system. Was a lot of fun watching oneself from a distance. 
They need to update that link: the tutorial (and recommendation for pipenv) got moved [here](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/managing-dependencies/#managing-dependencies).
Honestly, an IRC bot. I've always had fun writing IRC bots and writing them in different languages too. It's neat to see how sockets, parsing, etc works in different languages. 
actually no, i should give it a shot
My first script was an rss collection engine. The reader part was php. At the time i was trying to write the engine in as many languages as i could to branch out. That was a few years ago and didn't touch python for a few years after that. Recently started work purely in python and rewrote that code from scratch to be more moduler so i could bring in different sources like twitter, reddit and hacker news as well. Now instead of a dynamic reader i use python to push out (static pages)[http://i.imgur.com/uKrez3g.jpg] with python. 
sure, one obvious example would be calculating eigen values of large matrices. For small matrices the performance difference is minor, but as you start building larger and larger matrices that approach the limit of your memory, Matlab performs far better. another would be regression but thats not a use case i do much of.
It's by the guy who did **requests**... he's [very opinionated](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/) but there's no question he knows his stuff and is passionate about getting Python right.
Not the first interesting program I'd done in Python, but the most recent: created VACnet. It uses Python + keras + tensorflow to identify cheaters in CSGO and then submits cases to Overwatch to have cheaters banned from the game.
that i am
Any examples, or further reading on this? Sounds super interesting and useful.
Eigenvalues... will try that when i have time :)
dude, youd be a hero if you got that to work more performantly. its a pretty common calculation with a bunch of good use cases the community could leverage. i suspect its something fundamental about numpy though unfortunately as Ive been working with it for a couple years and am pretty good at it by this point. be well.
Thanks! 
The key is that the easiest factor to find will be a prime number no more than the square root of the target. E.g. If I'm checking 159, I won't try factors above √159 ~= 12.6. The largest prime below 12.6 is 11, so I'd divide against the known primes up to 11, so 2, 3, 5, 7, 11. Memoization would be to keep track of the numbers you've checked, so if I asked it if 159 is prime again, it'd recall that that input returned true last time, so it could skip the calculation.
Well that's cool!
yes, I believe I'm having trouble importing the library. I ran the command, help("modules") and I could not find Pillow or PIL.
Lol, sounds both complicated and simply at the same time. Is that a standard framework or something of your own design?

[AngularJS](https://angularjs.org) 
The command: easy_install Python Do I run this in the Python command line or in my program at the beginning? I get a syntax error when I run that command in my terminal.
First time I've heard of this challenge. I just recently started learning Python so I think this will be a fun way to practice :)
I wish there was a book on programming that instead of explaining things from the start showed little examples like in this cheatsheet to build up my knowledge instead of repeatedly learning print("Hello World") and if else. 
I wish I had the experience to do a fully fledged franework on my own, but it is made and maintained by google. It has an opinionated way of doing things, so at first it may seem complicated but when you understand how everything works, you can understand almost every Angular app. It's good for companies as all their projects would share same structure (components, services, etc), so the cost of switching projects is almost non-existent.
For contracts, yes. The actual client is in Rust. 
Unless you: * are working in an industry that uses python 2 which is unlikely because you should already know why in that case. * have to absolutely use libraries that aren't ported, but again unlikely because most things are ported and there aren't any weak points for beginners * Have to use the distro provided version which again is unlikely unless you're in a locked down system, There is no reason to use python 2. Python 3 is newer and better, and you should definitely start with it.
Thanks, I'll look into it, sound interesting.
Cheers.
"I received a syntax error" doesn't describe the problem well enough. What's the exact error message? Why didn't you try doing simply `pip install Pillow`? Also, the link you provided doesn't seem to exist. 
AF_ALG looks fun. Make me really want to use 3.6 now.
Not a cheat sheet but check out A Byte of Python. Short examples like this for the basics
Thanks for your suggestions!! The library is not complete yet, however we decided to bring more people together to help us improve the library faster. I will publish your comments as issues in the GitHub repo. Thanks again!!
Okay, In my command line I typed: &gt;&gt;&gt; pip install Pillow File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1 pip install Pillow SyntaxError: invalid syntax Apologies: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Pillow If it doesn't work this time it's just a link to where I downloaded the package
This version focus on features that was the main reason why I switched to PyCharm a few months ago - venv integration and remote interpreters (vagrant, docker). Most of the project that I work now are dockerized. Having environment that automates everything, not require separate venv for local development, auto-completion from the remote interpreter, and allow to run tests/debug mode in docker container is production improvement for me. And now having it running even faster and better is super cool.
3.
You are write for sure. We have several scripts to test each functionality but we couldn't translate that into `Unittest` examples yet. However, there are already issues opened to solve this question. We are a small team of people using the library and we know that its not 100% yet, but we want to bring more people interested on the project to help us improve it faster. 
Oh my gosh. `pip` is a __command line tool!__ It's not a Python command. How on Earth can you not see this is _definitely_, 100% not valid syntax? How could you not _even try_ to search for any kind of tutorial on `pip` online? Because if you did, you'd immediately know that `pip` is to be run __from the command line!__ Or, Terminal, or cmd.exe or whatever. I think you should absolutely drop whatever you've been trying to write in Python and go _learn some Python_ first. Please do it.
a cousin project to chromeless is puppeteer (which is contributed by Google, and uses headless chrome). Puppeteer is a bunch of node libs .. but i've come across Pyppeteer .. the equiv in Python. not sure how complete it is: https://github.com/miyakogi/pyppeteer 
Holy shit your code sucks. Read pep 8 as well as the documentation for the standard library (argparse, for starters) and learn to use a linter. You're way too proud of yourself for what little you've accomplished, both in terms of this project's functionality and in your learning. Programming may not be for you. Go back to r/The_Donald, where people of your intelligence belong, until you can write code that isn't complete garbage.

Why is 3.6 needed for using the AF_ALG syscall?
Have you looked at 'descriptors'? https://docs.python.org/3/howto/descriptor.html
Are there other benefits to using the AF_ALG syscall apart from performance? Do you get better entropy or is it more secure in any way? Also, very pythonic code!
I should be working, but i'm solving puzzles now... thanks... :D
This is an excellent cheat sheet! Much obliged for sharing!
GNU Hello World.
Why are you messing with slicing syntax to reverse instead of using `reversed()` ?
After having used npm and Elixir's mix, I must say that I do think Pipenv is very welcome in my workflow. It's not complicated to set up and it just does away with a lot of stuff that should be handled automatically, as it mostly is with pipenv.
Or simply use a negative number for the step parameter to range: range(25, 12-1, -1)
You can search some challenges, read some books and Cookbooks about python. Think about any task you would like to automatize using python. Try solvente basic problems using python...

Why are you self limiting to excel? You can do so much more. You can always do a final visualization and delivery with excel. You just need to be doing all you manipulations in something better like python. 
With regards to your question with Plotly, the answer is no. Have you checked out [Dash](https://github.com/plotly/dash)? Here is a quick [intro](http://pbpython.com/plotly-dash-intro.html).
Python 3.0.0 release date of 2008-12-03. [Still downloadable](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/)! Not sure that the terminology 'the new thing' applies anymore.
I was told in the tutorial to write it the way but something went a awry "**** off World!" Baby's first program.
If it's not new anymore, why change?
Yep, I'll link a gist to it if I can find it
It's using a combination of Pure Storage API calls and Oracle ASM scripts. Probably wouldn't be that useful unless you're using a pure storage sadly.
Great thanks

Man i need to start polishing that cv..

AF_ALG socket still keeps iv and key be handled by userspace. Therefore, applications need to set the socket options like: ``` setsockopt(SOL_ALG, ALG_SET_KEY, key) sockmsg_afalg([msg], ALG_OP_ENCRYPT, iv) ``` to provide the encrypt and decrypt information in kernel space. I think entropy is the application problem not AF_ALG itself. By the way, openssl 1.1.x has already support AF_ALG. You can see more information here: https://github.com/openssl/openssl/blob/46f4e1bec51dc96fa275c168752aa34359d9ee51/engines/e_afalg.c
For questions like this i recommend you to ask on /r/learnpython the dedicated python reddit for learning.
Ha! maybe several benefits have already been noticed. https://bugs.python.org/issue27744
Try using mypy. The pycharm checker is helpful but gives false positives. In the case it's possible the method is annotated wrong also
Try /r/learnpython and [CheckIO](https://checkio.org/).
I really like the idea of using plotly but I have no idea how to get started. I can see online you have to pay various things but its not clear to me what I have to pay for. Do I just have to pay if I want to host the graphs on Plotly servers. I'm just wondering if it would be possible to generate these graphs and put them into a webpage by myself?
I was thinking perhaps I could use Django to get me started and then incorporate Bokeh into the mix. But I would want to keep everything hosted on a server of my own rather than anything external so I can keep everything free.
Python 3 isn't broken. Why would you arbitrarily decide to use a deprecated version if you didn't have to?
&gt; Man i need to start polishing that cv For real. That's why I included the part about changing companies. Nothing wrong with the company I was initially with, but part of the reason there was so much opportunity to script 'easy' things was that they weren't tech-minded and didn't know how to value the work. The other bonus to moving was my current company uses a lot of different tech. Too much, actually, but I've gotten a lot more affluent and used a fair bit of my f-off time for self-study (That might be a big part of the winning formula, now that I think about it).
That's pretty unwarranted. I know my code sucks, I've just started developing with python only a few months ago. For two, this isn't my only project. And three, you cannot sway me away from my hobby.
See, [u/knowsuchagency](https://reddit.com/u/knowsuchagency)? This is how to not be a complete douche. The reality is I did try using json, but somewhere along the line, I lost the source. Either that or decided not to use json yet. What you see is the "final" product after I filter through ideas to add on. I do like your weather add-on idea, so I might go and add that.
Also I do not intend on restyling my code just yet. Lets not focus on the little things.
I didn't say Python 3 was broken, but rather Python 2 isn't broken. And to be honest (even if it cost me downvotes), Python 2 is far from being obsolete, even after being tagged deprecated for so many years. It works and it's mature. Aren't those enough reasons to use 2?
How far along did you get? 
Good point...Any chance you could file a ticket for that? 
Don't want to influence you, but you can check my bot on [github](https://github.com/LorkScorguar/Luchiana). It's not the best and all dialog are in French but I tested lot of things: client/server vs standalone, hardcoded vs database sentences, how to launch various actions etc. 
You're right that we've included scientific stuff in the past in Community Edition. And all those things that we included, are still in Community Edition. We are planning to work hard on some "professional" data science parts that will go into Professional (while continuing to improve the parts that are in Community.) This is similar to the debugger. Most parts are in Community. Some parts (e.g. thread concurrency visualization, remote debugging) are in Professional.
His code is not the best and he miss lot of pep recommandations, but as far as I understand he's learning. I pretty sure that your first program had some fault too. But I'm agree that he's too proud of his work. Clarissa can be great but at this time it's cleary not the most sophisticated python bot.
What are you interested in? Web? Security? Games? The best thing is to start a project that you want and solve problems as they come up. 
Python 3 also works and is mature. More mature, in fact - it has a bunch of additional features and other improvements. I have the option of two cars, which cost the same. One is a 2000, and works fine. But in a few years, it'll be hard to find parts for and a lot of mechanics won't be able to fix it up. The other is a 2008, also works fine. It does everything the first car does, plus more - it has heated seats, a little more horsepower, and so on: plus, new free upgrades will keep coming out for years. Aren't those enough reasons to use 3?
Ahh, wrong subreddit. My bad. Thanks for the /r/ and the other suggestion! checking that out now. 
Use pytest! It's much easier to convert personal-use testing functions into unit tests that way, and it's a more modern, more pythonic way of testing, rather than `unittest`, which uses a testing pattern designed for a language very different to python from the 1970s.
How can python 3 be more mature than python 2 where it's 10 years younger (or around that)? Having more features doesn't make it more mature, on the opposite. Neverthless. The fact that Python 3 is mature doesn't change the fact that Python 2 is mature and just works. Saying that Python 3 is like that too is not enough reason to change.
Isn't the whole point of git that you can back up code in a more sensible way than just a straight copy and paste?
We're not talking about changing. We're talking about which one someone should pick if they're starting (or starting a new project). Mature means that there aren't any significant bugs or missing features, that documentation and tooling support is very good, and that the library ecosystem is good. This is the case for both python 2 and python 3. Maturity is not a distinguishing factor in that sense. But python 2 is missing features compared to python 3, and pretty soon some major libraries (Django, numpy, iPython) will, or already have, moved away from python 2, so its library support and ecosystem is actually getting worse compared to python 3.
Fortran is even more mature, and also just works. Stock up on punch cards.
Get a cheap DELL server off Ebay. You can virtualize - user Docker. Learn so much more.
You're right! It was previously officially recommended in the PyPA docs, but no longer, it seems. Standards are only worthwhile if people use them, otherwise they just complicate matters. It looks like maybe pipenv just hasn't caught on.
As someone who uses virtualenvwrapper and conda on the same machine currently, and has a bunch of environments for both, it looks like it would be a massive hassle to switch over to pyenv - is this the case?
Selectolax, it’s like Exlax for HTML parsing!
Cargo is a single tool, though, and that's its power. Yes, there are plugins, but the basics are all there. Pipenv needs pyenv to install python versions, and pyenv needs a bunch of other plugins to be compatible with conda and existing virtualenvs, and I'm generally sceptical of system-wide python utilities anyway as I switch between environments a lot.
It's a bit different. Python 3 doesn't offer whole new concepts. It offers only new features. From Fortran to Python you got OOP and Duck Typing. And from punch cards, you got screen, dynamic typing and lot of other stuffs. But from Python 2 to Python 3, the changes are on a much smaller scale. And that's pretty much the reason of the curse behind Python 3. It broke the compatibility to allow new features and a better standardization, but it didn't bring enough changes to really make it essential.
&gt;How can python 3 be more mature than python 2 where it's 10 years &gt;younger (or around that)? Because Python 2 has been in maintenance mode for some time now, while Python 3 has continued to improve. More importantly, the whole point of Python 3 was to fix things that *don't* work in Python 2.
Your only complaint seems to be that it broke backwards compatibility. Which is completely irrelevant to a new programmer who has nothing to be backwards compatible with. Python 3 is the obvious choice for someone who is just starting. There is no reason to intentionally handicap yourself just for the sake of "the good ol' days" that you were not around for.
You don't have to influence, you can fork and modify Clarissa.
But it's like I keep saying: Clarissa is in beta. If I find a feature I would love to add, I would.
The code isn't public unfortunately. It was an insane bunch of format strings of equivalent C snippets to Snort rule options (e.g. [byte_test](http://manual-snort-org.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/node32.html#SECTION004531000000000000000)). If you're interested in this work look into a compilers course. LLVM is an amazing ecosystem for working with code. There is an LLVM intermediate language that can compile into a lot of different architectures. OCaml too, it's a functional language that has really good support for writing parsers and lexers. You can write a lexer and parser in OCaml, then from the AST emit LLVM IR, then use Clang to emit an executable in the architecture of your choosing. It's a fun project.
While yes I can use a local db, the thing is I want it to constantly receive scripts from my database. I will look into local databases though.

haven't used conda with it so far, but i imagine if you have your conda envs defined in environment files it should be easy to recreate them... try it :) https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/blob/master/COMMANDS.md#pyenv-install

I use BeautifulSoup to search and youtube-dl to download and convert. 
Lol, I don't think I've ever been able to recover a conda environment from an env file...
Not comparable. One's a port of some of the ideas from yarn, or bundler/`Gemfile` to Python (automatic version locking rather than manual, showing the dependency graph when locking, etc.).
Of course it's not comparable but look at the other answers about virtualenv creation tools. That's why I mentioned `direnv` with a winking emoji. I think the closest tool to `pipenv` that is actually useful and popular is `pip-tools` with its `pip-compile` which I highly recommend.
The `venv` creation should be an afterthought.
Hilarious. Oh, you're serious? Why aren't you just using vanilla dropbox on your machine and go drink a beer with all the time you saved?
Yeah even I knew that. But much like most politicians, I lied to get people.
Thanks a bunch! I'll dig into those resources you mentioned, I've been trying to figure out how I'm going to handle this kind of thing without having a whole security team :)
No problem! Reading through it, I cringe at my variable names and just really bad readability. It’s almost like I designed it this badly as an exercise for someone else in clean documentation.
[Mode Analytics](https://about.modeanalytics.com/python/) has integrated python notebooks in their BI product. You can import all the normal python viz libraries (matplotlib, plotly, etc.) and since Mode is cloud-based, you don't have to worry about hosting anything yourself.
Last I checked pyenv needed one plugin to manage virtualenv, and another if you also wanted it to emulate virtualenvwrapper, but I suppose two could qualify as a bunch. Thing is, and I might be wrong here, but it appears you don't need either if you're using pipenv to do the job of managing your environment (note: not speaking to conda, never used it professionaly, doubt I ever will), as pyenv then only exists to bootstrap in your environment's specified interpreter. I get being wary, but these tools do, definitely, make life easier in other languages, and low level management of virtualenvs without dependency resolution is a far cry from a high level tool that can figure out and lock your whole dependency chain... there's been a need for this for some time, and while, yes, I do prefer cargo's single executable -- and rust's entire packaging story -- I think this one's got real legs.
Both the ClamAV and Snort docs are really good if you want to learn signature and rule writing. Snort can be a pain to setup but ClamAV isn't too bad. You can definitely learn both if you sit down and read the docs, maybe follow a few tutorials (though, they don't always have the best practices). 
This is great! Thank you!
Python is best enjoyed like good Scotch. 1.4 came out 21 years ago this week, so I only use that. 
That sounds pretty cool. How are you going about it?
Another strong contender: https://benkurtovic.com/2014/06/01/obfuscating-hello-world.html
No idea why that did not work. My gf who is a programmer for a living says it should work. I am stumped and at a lost. This was a sample code from the python site so not sure why it wouldn't work
print(randint(1,1000))
This is awesome, thanks
r/learnpython
Oh odd the site shows print randint(1,1000) with no () for print strange. I wonder why it works with my gfs computer as is. Could it be mac vs windows. Granted there is always the chance she corrected the mistake and didn't think about it. https://pythonspot.com/en/random-numbers/ Site for reference. 
This is very helpful! Thanks!
What exactly is it you want to do? argparse has a lot of features. You can specify mutually-exclusive options, partial-named options, option data types, required and optional non-option arguments (yes, I know), etc. argparse also creates a help message automatically, and can parse any random iterable of strings, not just sys.argv. 
One thing I miss from the official multiprocessing library and have implemented on my own is the ability to schedule the tasks dynamically, given the time each task takes and adjust chunk sizes on the fly. This makes multiprocessing useful on almost all tasks, rather than just heavy weight ones. My inspiration (aka copying pretty much) was from OpenMP: https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/openmp-loop-scheduling If you were to implement that in Flock, I might use it. 
This website is using python2, which you should not use, except if you are forced to. You should find a book or a tutorial which uses python3.
Oh that makes sense she likely is using python2. Okay that makes a lot more sense all I understand more now that 2 and 3 can be different than just minor improvements. 
Python would be perfect for this. https://automatetheboringstuff.com/chapter9/ You can get this working very quickly i think. 
For future reference: /r/learnpython is the right place. 
&gt;the whole point of Python 3 was to fix things that don't work in Python 2. Now *that* is a good reason.

one of the most useful thing I've found on this subreddit
Easy_install is old, just use pip.
He definitely rewraps the Java API in [Beyond PEP 8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf-BqAjZb8M), but he goes through Pythonic idioms in Transforming Code into Beautiful, Idiomatic Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSGv2VnC0go); the sentinel value example you mentioned is at [12:28](https://youtu.be/OSGv2VnC0go?t=748).
Because it's going to be broken in two years, when support stops. 
Programmed obsolescence. Python 2 could run very well for another 20 years.
I'm trying to prevent null / empty json api responses from blowing up my code. 
Aww doesn’t feel very nice when people are mean to you for trivial reasons without knowing you, does it? Might want to think about that in the future... just saying. [This book](https://www.amazon.com/Effective-Python-Specific-Software-Development/dp/0134034287) is a gem; helped me out a lot when I was getting started. 
What advantages does this have over the http server in the standard library?
I can't find anything in that page that explains what I'm looking at. 
Currently going to a boot Camp and we start out Capstones this week! 
These are the best types of projects
You can't have loops inside of mainloop().
Try using .after on your root window and calling it repeatedly in a method
You could just make that yourself?
So I'm making the assumption that your data will be coming in the following form arr = [['Aaron, Julia J', '$97,783 ', 'Clarion', 'Chair'], ['Aaron, Paul Neal', '$23,961 ', 'Shippensburg', 'Custodial Worker 1']] Everything starting as a string, already separated into the four categories. The maximum row can be gotten with: highest_paid_person = max(arr, key = lambda x : int(x[1].replace(",", "").replace("$", ""))) To break it down further: I'm calling the max function on your list, then creating an inline function that takes a row in the iterable as input. Max will return the place where the function is at a maximum. The function looks at row[1] (the pay), removes the dollar signs and commas, and then converts it to an integer. The row that created the highest integer gets returned. There are almost certainly better ways (double replace is kind of an antipattern, I think), and you made need to change it depending on how exactly you're taking in input, but hopefully that should either address your problem or help you get started. 
Why bother finding server/client libraries if you can use http2 or raw sockets for internal APIs. 
I write bots to play games for people, from Facebook games to mmorpgs, let me know what you need and I'll see if I can create it. Automation is my thing. So it doesn't have to strictly be a computer game.

I've changed from `beautifulsoup4` + `lxml` to this and I've reduced my parsing time to 50% of what it was before. Thank you for sharing. 
To be honest, we came up with the acronym after as you may have figured out x)
Thanks man. Next time if you see something like this, don't be a jerk. Explain to the person why their idea isn't new, and what they should do.
Lol pretty rich being asked not to be a jerk by a trumpkin like yourself. I gave you advice from the beginning. It’s your fault if you’re such a snowflake as to take the jabs personally. 
First spend the time to put your data in a dataframe in something like ```Pandas```
That. There are now [26 months of official pyhton 2 support remaining](https://pythonclock.org/) - then you will have to update your codebase. Any new project in python should be version 3.
Yep. I'd do it this way. A one liner in Pandas after importing into a dataframe.
This is great!

That is quite the transition in project difficulty.

That is a truly great and inspiring story! I do realize the importance of having a mentor. I recently started studying python on my free time. It gets a little messy sometimes as I jump between different topics. Maybe you could help me build some kind of structure and guide me into what I should focus on when practicing python?
Keep learning man it gets more fun once you add Django
Here's a list of things you said: &gt; Holy shit your code sucks. &gt; You're way too proud of yourself for what little you've accomplished, both in terms of this project's functionality and in your learning. &gt; Programming may not be for you. &gt; Go back to r/The_Donald, where people of your intelligence belong, until you can write code that isn't complete garbage. Yeah..."snowflake"

It's multi-threaded, and will be multi-processed once I get around to it, it has easy support for ssl built in, it's designed to work around a config file that makes deploying multiple instances easier, it's designed to be extended relatively easily. That's mostly it, and I'm not gonna lie, I built it to learn more about sockets, just thought it might be neat or useful to someone else.
Unfortunately not, that code is long long gone. But, it probably takes like two modules and 30 lines of code. Your use os for moving files, glob + string list to identify files by '.extensiion'.
If you just want the person with the highest salary, you should use the solution /u/Zigity_Zagity proposed. If you want to sort the list you can use the same lambda as /u/Zigity_Zagity proposed but with the **sort** method and there are two cases: * Keep the initial state of the list: you'll need to use the **sorted()** builtin * Don't care about list's initial state: let's use the **list.sort()** method peopleList.sort(key=lambda person: int(person[1].strip(",$")), reverse=True) If you wanted the list sorted from lowest to highest salary, just don't put the reverse argument (or you could just use **list.reverse()** but that' silly).

Lol, not very. I had a lot of the flow planned out in my mind and was beginning to tinker with the implementation when it happened. If it had been up to me it could easily still have been 2 years by the time I got around to it. I'd actually forgotten all about it until you mentioned your idea.
Try /r/learnpython. Show them the code you have and describe where you are stuck. Be sure to [format your code for reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/faq#wiki_how_do_i_format_code.3F) or use a site like pastebin. Also, include which version of python and what OS you are using. 
In my experience that comes under the umbrella of not testing someone else's code. In this example, I'm willing to bet that you're just passing the SQL query through to a db connection that's created using some library or other. If you're using someone else's code like that, it's not your responsibility to test. Now, if you want to make sure that your code is doing what it should with what it gets back from the database, then you can mock that out pretty easily: from mock import patch @patch("data_platform.DataPlatformConnection.execute_sql", return_value=[(1158, 'Lakeview Elementary School', '4141034')]) def test_database_info_used_correctly(*_): # This is important as the patched function will be passed into the function as a parameter, you just don't need to use it directly, so you can wildcard all of the arguments conn = data_platform.DataPlatformConnection() text_string = conn.format_string_from_db_data(1158) # This format function is what's actually being tested assert text_string == "Lakeview Elementary School has an SID of 1158 and a code of 414034" This allows you to ensure that the function does what you'd expect given a "known" database response Your other option I guess is to test to make sure that your pass-through to the underlying library's DB connection is being called with the SQL query you're passing in, which you could do like this: from mock import patch @patch("library.connection.execute_sql") def test_db_connection(patched_db_connection): # This time we want to use the patched function directly, so you'll want to name it so that you can use it properly conn = data_platform.DataPlatformConnection() sql = "select * from table" conn.execute_sql(sql) patched_db_connection.assert_called_once_with(sql) But again, I would question the need to do that, seeing as it's a simple enough operation to be pretty hard to mess up - each to their own though
 You should finish it for her. She sounds like she's worth the effort.

I also wouldn't call the improvements minor anymore, it has come quite some way the last 9 years. As /u/Arturre said, you should not use 2. Start with 3.
Sounds good I'll probably get drunk and do this tonight lol Thanks!
Oh i know now that i looked into it more,. 
Preach. I honestly think the reason I have never taken up any major programming is because of this. I recsntly found a course on Lynda I think for Linux System Programming (mostly C, some python) and it just got into the nitty gritty so fast that I fell in love with it. My whole C experience was watching 5 or 6 CS50 course video, doing no work, but this deep dive i to Linuc Programming got my interest right away. 
OK so VBA is actually what that consultant used when he wrote those scripts. I looked into it at first thinking I'd learn that but, after browsing reddit, I found out that I shouldn't bother as it has no future and will likely be discontinued/replaced by Microsoft sometime in the next few years. Someone recommended Python as it can be easily used for Excel but it can also do so much more. Which is true! Python is awesome. As for packages that interact with excel, there are tons out there. PyExcel and XLWings come to mind. I got started with the Excel chapter from "automate the boring stuff" - you should check it out, it's awesome and free. 
I think r/learnpython might be a good place for this question. I'm unfamiliar with `codeskulptor` so this perhaps gives the question a little extra relevance here...
So one thing I hit up when I tried doing things was that it seems very much like terminals do not have key down and key up events... which can be problematic for games. 
Sure thing! I started off with running through the code academy tutorials to get the basics of Python and programming concepts in general. Definitely a must. This took a couple of weeks if I remember correctly. I then dived straight into the project as soon as I had a general feel for how I could achieve what I wanted to do. I found an awesome free book online called automate the boring stuff which had a chapter specifically for Excel. Although you should know it's quite outdated so some stuff doesn't really work anymore, especially if you're using Python 3.x (the book is for 2.x). Then the rest was just trial and error really. I wrote some pseudocode (e.g. "Loop over each row in column C and grab all values over 9000") and then converted that into actual code. StackOverflow was my go to resource whenever I'd run into errors and issues I had no idea how to solve. Oh and error handling is key! Especially when working with large and messy data, there's always something that pops up that you haven't thought of. And the rest is history! Best of luck with your project. 
Solved! "Https everywhere" was holding me up.
Two of them are pretty basic static sites built on top of a CMS platform (Wagtail, not sure if you've heard of it). The third which I'm deploying next month is one I'm quite excited about, it's kind of like thisiswhyimbroke but with a very specific niche. Oh, and it plugs into all sorts of API's and works magic in automating stuff. By the way, if you don't mind me asking, you've covered so many different applications for python in your channel which are all awesome (especially that self driving car thing in GTA) - Is there any one particular area/field you feel more drawn to than others?
Thanks - that’s very interesting. I did also find a curses library for PyGame (although I’ve lost it now!) so maybe that’s a better route to go down.
How do you manage your Python installation? I’m so confused by PIP and Conda.
Funny, I was in a training class recently, and someone asked just this question.

Probably the 3 biggest issues you'll likely see when starting out in python related to differences between 2 and 3 are print, "range", and division. Print--Python3's print is `print(STUFF)`; 2 allowed `print STUFF` Division--Python3 does true division using "/" (e.g. 3 / 2 == 1.5) and integer division using "//" (e.g. 3 // 2.0 == 1.0). Python2 will do integer division for both "/" and "//" if the values are ints (e.g. 3 / 2 == 1 and 3 // 2 == 1). It acts just like python 3 if any of the values are floats (3 / 2.0 == 1.5, 3 // 2.0 == 1.0). Range--Last one that seems common is Python2 had an "xrange()" that appears quite often in a lot of sample code as well as a range. Python3 just has just "range()". So if you copy past P2 code with xrange it will fail--if you change xrange to range it will work as intended.
Thanks for your suggestion. DataPlatformConnection class is using psycopg2 library for the connection but that's it. `execute_sql` function is a custom function not part of that library. For a better insight here is how my class looks like - https://codeshare.io/axPDPL 
Really nice and positive story! Well done, and keep going! 
I started using PyQt to build a front-end for my work project from a few months ago. I'm not sure how I felt about it - I really like the fact that it runs in a GUI now but I wasn't crazy about the process. I did a lot of Visual C# work in college, so it was kinda rough building it in Qt directly via code. I would love to use a designer if anyone knows of one!
Urwid and asciimatics are good
Interesting, this is the first time I've heard of BeeWare. A couple of observations ... BeeWare could really steal a march on Kivy. I tried Kivy a while ago and really wanted it to succeed but it seems like a project mainly for Python enthusiasts and the lack of native UI options makes it really limiting. It also really needs investment and for a project that has been around a while it's been disappointing to see the lack of progress. There are a couple of other (non Python) x-platform projects that have succeeded over Kivy because of what I mention Kivy is lacking (and what may do for BeeWare). RubyMotion (using Ruby) and Xamarin (using C# or F#) both had commercial backing and were paid for projects (and still have that option for enterprise users) before opening up their platforms for free. I really think any serious mobile Python option needs to look at something along these lines, at least to begin with.

It can't, but I'm sure with machine learning you could find similar barcodes.
Well, asyncio is a dumpster fire of horrible design (ignoring the generator API in favour of passing around a loop instsnce, 3 different ways to do networking and they all suck, etc.) but gevent definitely isn't better.
You should try the addict module: https://github.com/mewwts/addict
range() is inclusive in the lower bound, but exclusive in the upper bound. So range(3, 5) = [3, 4]. Since your divisor iterates over range(3, prime - 1) it never actually reaches prime - 1, and your if condition that prints is never true. Good luck!
You might also look at dot_access and the other things I have listed in [the relevant section of my Python OOP guide](https://github.com/metaperl/python-oop/blob/master/README.md#data-structure-ish).

Just wanted to drop by and say that I'll be checking out your book, been looking for something a bit more than beginner stuff and your work might be just that. Also very inspiring to see what you've done with your coding club. I recently started one at the business university I'm attending for my MSc. Gathered some awesome ideas from the activities you've done so far. Tldr thanks for sharing 
Do you use python 1?
WHY ARE YOU USING 2.7?!
I just started with python and my first useful script is a Transmission torrent queue manager. When a download finishes, it determines the seeding requirements per-tracker for every torrent. Some things get copied to an archive to seed forever, some get deleted after hitting a certain ratio, public torrents get removed immediately. Any incoming FLAC music files get copied to a separate watched folder for encoding. Used 3 different libraries (transmission-fluid, os, and shutil!).
Not by choice. Working on a project that requires it.
I have been getting antsy with my progress. I’m learning Python because it was my first recommendation for a Data Science Workshop I considered taking in May. I don’t know jack about CompSci. I decided I wanted to be a DS in February with a Liberal Arts Degree. All I have is an Intro to Stats class under my belt, and the ability to learn. I’m nearly aware now of how complicated the DS umbrella is, but with that said, I’m learning Python because it’s one of the best languages to learn (especially for DS, #Anaconda). I have been going slowly with Learn Python 3 The Hard Way. I’ve begun to doubt his instructing method is the best learning style for me, but nonetheless I have been printing every script, and analyzing every line to make sure I understand what is happening, how, and how I can apply it to something I do, like the calculator I made for daily caloric intake. Anyways, I thought I could wait until finishing the book to go back and break all the code, but functions has taught me the hard way that this is not the case. I was so confused by what was inflexible and what was arbitrary that I had to replace variables and break code just to determine what it was I was (or wasn’t) learning. That being said, I got a little antsy because I am definitely tried for patience, desiring a DS or Data Analytics job so badly. I know I have to stay calm, maintain discipline and be persistent, but I ventured out this week to see if there were better ways I could learn. I bought a Paperwhite Kindle and bought some (also got some free) 
Going through Automate the Boring Stuff with Python and doing the pattern recognition stuff. It is very interesting and I’m excited to learn more! Anyone have good small projects to work on to get better?
I just did this for managing seed requirements for torrents and cleaning up the downloads folder when they're done on a pre-tracker basis. Very useful and only took an hour or two. transmission-fluid to control my torrent client. shutil and os to move the files around.
The place to find python software is PyPI - the Python Package Index https://pypi.python.org/. For example, https://pypi.python.org/pypi/npyscreen/. 
Maybe one day. Perhaps for our 20th anniversary.... There's so many more possibilities now with programmable gadgets and easy communication between everything!
...is it raining outside?
I took your advice and added json instead of hardcoded python. 
My original game was pygame, nowadays I use a game engine I'm writing for most projects. [mentioned in this reply. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/7gm1ze/comment/dqksbmv?st=JAOMZM2H&amp;sh=346efcd7) There's other choices, as well: Kivy, pyglet are two big options. 
A README and fill in some of the PyPI metadata would improve accessibility. There are some places where it looks like assert statements are doing error handling. Instead use explicit raise statements with, where possible, informative Exceptions, at least more informative than: assert rtn[TestUtil.return_code] == 0 
Clarion University actually has a Julia J Aaron. is this real salary data? Are you breaking any laws right now?
This is some random data for a class 
That’s a perfectly valid and respectable reason to do this. You can’t beat the std lib if you can’t build something simpler - good on you.
Check out [pipenv](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pipenv), I highly recommend using this over manually managing virtual environments.
This usually happens when the python linked is different from the python running. I believe it has to do with mismatches in finding symbols in the dynamic library. The python version you build for should be exactly the same as the runtime version. Theoretically, the Python ABI is supposed to be stable, but it isn't always, so better safe than sorry.
Why not use `sys.stdout.write` instead of `print` and use `sys.stdout.flush` in attempt to show output as soon as available?
never heard of or used Sabaki but the first thing you might try is flushing stdout's buffer. Sabaki is likely buffering your prints and if you don't fill that buffer, it wont print until the end of the program. 
Look into an algorithm called sieve of Eratosthenes and try to code that. Easier to start by coding an existing solution when just starting out.
One way to ensure that there is only one version of python available is to use a virtualenv. http://www.pythonforbeginners.com/basics/how-to-use-python-virtualenv
Thank you for your kind words :) 
Thanks. I can surely help you as much as I can. Just send me a msg on reddit and I can share my email with you. :) 
I am so glad that you found my story helpful and inspiring. As for the book, I wrote it for people exactly like you! Take a look and I am sure that you will find new stuff in it. And if you find any problem in the text or code you can always submit a pull request! 
I am sorry if it felt like that. The purpose was to inspire people by telling them that they can achieve anything even if they don't have all the required resources and that they only have to look for help at the right places and they will get it. Acting like /r/iamverysmart was never the motive. 
These give a good summary; do they help? https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/exceptions https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/exception-handling 
Great story. Keep up the good work. 
* https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#built-in-exceptions * https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#exception-hierarchy I've found the "Exception Hierarchy" useful from time to time, it just helps me visualize how they fit together. 
Trying that, and this happens: while True: inp = sys.stdin.readline().strip() cmd = inp.split(" ") sys.stdout.write(do_stuff(cmd) + "\n") sys.stdout.flush() And the result bunches up: NN Go&gt; name = NN Go = 0.1 = 2 ● NN Go&gt; version … ● NN Go&gt; protocol_version … ● NN Go&gt; list_commands … ● NN Go&gt; boardsize 19 … ● NN Go&gt; clear_board

funny enough, I literally did the exact same thing this week for the TNF x Supreme collab that I didn't end up using. Here's a fun tip - you can use the requests module to constantly access the product page until the new item drops. After that, go into the product page and get the: * size code * product code * csrf token and then cart the item and then dump the cookie into selenium. Once you have those pieces of information, it's as simple as sending a post request to "http://www.supremenewyork.com/shop/**product_code**/add" with the following data: { "utf-8": "%E2%9C%93", "X-CSRF-Token": "csrf_token", "st": product_code", "s": "size_code", "commit": "add to cart" } after that, dump the session to selenium and go to "https://www.supremenewyork.com/checkout" and you'll see your item carted (be sure to have selenium open to the supreme website in advance otherwise the cookies won't load properly). My version of the code can access the cart in about 3 seconds and autofill the data, but you also want to wait 3 seconds before hitting the checkout (the delay prevents you from getting flagged for auto fill). good luck!

Thank you so much!
That is so awesome. Esp. the 1st one. Trying to remove erroneous data from my pH/conductivity probes.
How about using asyncio instead of twisted?
Why so?
And by "created" you actually mean: "code I copied from other people"? Functions names alone are so inconsistent that you didn't write this yourself. Most of the functions literally just call other applications. I guess you've made a fancy wrapper. What I find little sad is that this post has any upvotes at all.
What is the use case for Python? I would suspect you would find examples in other languages like C/C++ Go, Java etc. Additionally, there are other VPN or VPN-like options that could be done using libssl, sock5, etc that seem to fit the Python use case better.

I have only been coding with Python for a year or two, but I guess now would be a good time to start learning C++ or Java... But is there some reason why I couldn't use Python? Is there really that much difference in terms of performance?
Kind of very basic. This should be in r/learnpython. Follow pep 8. Also as a security expert myself, don't use os.system. it's insecure. Just imagine anyone appending &amp;&amp; RM -rf /. Also you should follow pep 257. I want to run ”pydoc modulename" to get the documentation, especially if you aren't providing man pages. Camel case function names are counter indicated in pep8. Underscores are better. 
Performance; probably at some point or scale. Python can do many awesome things but secretly doesn't want to be the jack of all trades of language. I'm sure it could be done in Python, but operating at the lower level protocols is usually done in other languages. The closer you go to layer 3, 4 in the OSI model the more a lower level languages is better suited. If you are wanting to do it to improve your skill totally go for it. You should look into the OpenVPN python libs and the way python can interact with said protocols. 
This turned out to be pretty much right. I ended up deleting as many stray python installs as I could and clearing out my paths until I only had the right one. Things seem sorted for now. Thanks!
Cool, thanks! Hopefully I don't need to juggle different versions again once I'm done with this project, but this seems like a useful resource if I do.
Copy and paste some cde you know works (GitHub?) to make sure you installed everything correctly. I can't believe it's nearly 2018 and we still can't have an AI personal assistant do this stuff for us

Nah i wrote it all myself except for the tab competion 
And if you think i copied it from somewhere show me something very similar...gotta have evidence to backup your claims man

So why is your naming scheme so inconsistent? And anyone can take your `generateShellcode()` and see that there are tons of references for thouse bytes. On top of all this is just bad code in general. No doubt it work, but one look at `main()` and all hope is lost.

Blogging in English when it's your second language is not easy. I respect the hustle. *But* if you're not going to use spell check, that's just annoying. 
naming is bad because i renamed functions too many times i originally had it as underscores then i changed it to camel case and yeah i used someone elses shellcode and i have no do not know a better way to handle the long chain of if elif statements
Thanks for your feedback. Please that's not my blog. I came across that post today and thought it was nice sharing it to this community.
&gt; d problems when trying to install Django, but I realized you need PyCharm pro to use that anyway django is completely independent of pycharm. in the pro addition you're paying for tools that assist you to write django apps You might want to ask this on r/learnpython instead. Responses will be better there.
Can you install these with pip or pip3 ? 
Well you have the most important part already, make something good you can show off on Github. Here's an idea for something I wanted to make but never did: Do you have an Android phone and bluetooth in the car? Download Automate and make a simple flow to POST timestamps and GPS coordinates every time you connect and disconnect from the bluetooth, add in the Google maps API and you can make a quick and dirty tool to analyze your driving habits. Even if this doesn't work for you, I hope it's good inspiration.

Pip/pip3 are nice and easy :)! Homebrew is another good one, but I did find it a little frustrating as some of my paths where broken/my where they should have been. Conflicting python and ruby installs from other accounts/Xcode etc... got it sorted though :). Homebrew is nice for creating an ecosystem and typing one line to keep things up to date. Pip/pip3 might require you type a few lines more, but are fairly bullet proof. 
Absolutely. And the repo has even more that looks as good about generators, unittesting, sqlalchemy and other useful stuff.
Isn't sys.stdout the same as print unless you redefined it? You probably just need to flush the output. It's 1000x more efficent to buffer the output. Just flush before a long running process.
Decided to make another dice rolling program. Dice rolling programs are programs I might someday use, so I don't mind creating them now and again. There is actually a lot of variation in dice rolling mechanics, so it's sometimes necessary to create a dice roller to meet the mechanics. I opted to explore guizero and create a graphical front end for the dice roller. In the past, I've used Kivy as well. Guizero is pretty simple, but the documentation is a bit weak and it's still in development. Nevertheless, I was able to cobble together a dice rolling program with a straightforward front end. I'm guessing my next program will also be a dice roller.
Did he actually benchmark code inside the IDE?
I do not understand your statement "Isn't the whole point of git that you can back up code". git is a tool for source control. If your production server is physically different machine than your git server than you could say that production code has a backup of code on git server. But this is more side effect than a real backup. 
COBOL can run for another 1000, what's your point here? 
+1. fzf changed my life
10% of motivation was because I wanted to learn how to use Dropbox from my own code. If I am using git on Dropbox, then I can not access my code from another computer. The argument could be, just install Dropbox on that computer, but this approach was not working for me. The main problem was with corporate proxy/firewalls, but git over HTTP is always working (at least fo far).
I'm not sure how you installed Kivy, but I had to build it with MSVC2015. You could also try Gohkle's build: https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#kivy In the end I gave up on Kivy after working with it for a solid weekend. I like dynamic UIs and it's really only suitable for fixed-elements with no overlapping. Now I more-or-less exclusively use one of the Qt-bindings (`qtpy` or `qt.py` backed with `PySide2`), despite the licensing. 
Yeah, that's an attribute dict, I've made such things in the past. It doesn't let me provide values to all the leafs though. from addict import Dict map = Dict() map.Foo = [0,1] map.Foo.X = [56,99] Will raise an `AttributeError`. The only real possibilities that I see are mass re-implementation of dunders, which would preferably be done in the C-api, or a new PEP. 
My take on this is: VS Code: * Faster * Prettier * Better editing PyCharm: * Works These days I moved fully away from VS Code for proper development. *VS Code does not let you set the PYTHONPATH*. If I work on something that needs a certain version of our own library, I need to either add it in code with sys.path.append or copy it into the project folder. Annoying. Supposedly you can do this with a .env file, but for me I still have to export the variable manually to run the file. *Error messages* are not clickable. In PyCharm I can jump to the right file/line with just one click. I still use VS Code pretty much daily. But now it's no longer my IDE. Now it's just my text editor.
Currently, github is at 7$ per month, that is 84$ per year. I do not see any cost benefit in paying this if I already have it with my hosting provider. Yes, open source code is free on github, but for some of my repositories I need privacy :-)
The first problem is your variable names aren't descriptive. As for any other problems, what do you expect it to do and what is it doing instead?
r/python just doesn't stop giving. Thanks! 
Hi, winner-godson, thanks for sharing that. Created a new Reddit account, just to say thanks. @others: Anyhow, since this was not an English literature or prose, I did not pay that much attention to proofreading, and it was a blog not a research paper. Lastly, it was my personal opinion that I had felt. I respect your difference in thoughts, so should you. :-) Lastly, Python extension developer was hired by Microsoft (and more are being hired), you can expect more functionality. PyCharm is a 7 year old IDE, Visual Studio Code is beginning to evolve. 
Everyone loves tools that log everything!
Maybe don't ignore the goddamn sidebar. It not only tells you how to properly format your code so we can actually read it, but it also tells you *to post your questions in /r/learnpython*
Hash the rows and columns and compare hashes, or join a whole row or column with '.'.join(list) and use the... If a in b syntax. When you use =, you are checking to see if the two objects are the exact same object, which they are not.

Ouch. True, but ouch.
Oh wow. This isn't how you want to be using the language facilities Look up set and list generators to start 
I could never remember to activate and deactivate virtual environments, so I rewrote my prompt function to detect when I’ve changed to a directory that has a virtual environment hanging off it, and automatically switch to it if so. Downside is that you may only run your scripts from that directory, but I’ve never been bothered by that.
So I should scrap the Anaconda/Spyder thing and just reinstall Python as normal. I hope I can get PyGame installed again - I had a nightmare before. There must be a nice tutorial or video somewhere explaining all about paths. Also, which editor should I use for coding? I like Sublime Text but remember that it was ultra confusing to set up build systems.
pycharm works well with databases : autocompletion of query strings, data editor and more tools that are really handy. there are a few plugins for that in vscode but they aren't really useful.
Maybe I'm misunderstanding, but when did you stop using it for development? VS Code improves quickly, I feel. [This link](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/environments) seems to show how to do what I'm assuming your issue was/is.
Hi, please do not ask for programming help here. Your question belongs into /r/learnpython. There you should also give a lot more info. With what you revealed, maybe this helps: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/610883/ddg#610893 
My 2 cents, I guess you can replace a long if/elif with a dict-based dispatch function as described here jaxenter.com/implement-switch-case-statement-python-138315.html
Hi. What are you actually trying to test here? It sounds like there's an inappropriate level of coupling here, which is why it's hard to test. Rather than focusing on what should happen to some variable that's buried in four levels of nesting, what's the actual behaviour of the system you're writing? 
 class SchoolFinder: def __init__(self, data_platform): self.data_platform = data_platform def find_by_id(self, id): return self.data_platform.execute_sql( 'SELECT sid, name, code FROM school WHERE sid = %s', id) class FakeDataPlatform: def __init__(self, data): self.data = data self.queries = [] def execute_sql(self, query, params): self.queries.append(query % params) return self.data dp = DataPlatform((1, "foo", "bar")) finder = SchoolFinder(dp) finder.find_by_id(1158) [query] = dp.queries assert query == "SELECT sid, name, code FROM prod.school WHERE sid = 1158;" Split your testing efforts. Write some integration tests against your DataPlatform with a real database. You don't need many, just enough to prove that it's sending queries through properly. The tests you've provided *should* run with a real database, or they're not testing anything meaningful. In the rest of your code, don't use a real DataPlatform, use a fake one that lets you return hardcoded data and capture the queries.
He might have said that because Asyncio is built-in.
Mullvad VPN is written in Python. You can download their client and take a look. I think they give you some free time to use it too.
It is, thank you! I always tend to want to be elaborate, but your right, some quick and dirty things might be better. Thank you!
Thanks a lot !
Yes, you're getting the entire feed. Read up on [ETag and Last-Modified headers](https://pythonhosted.org/feedparser/http-etag.html). It's a good practice to get in to.
should i PR or please add save function awesome game btw
Hi /r/Python, this library provides a pattern that we've been using extensively to shield against external API failures in our Django application. Rather than have your HTTP request fail, any error in enclosed code blocks will be logged and suppressed. Django example: from error_boundary import ErrorBoundary def some_view(request): some_model = ... some_model.save() # Return HTTP 200 even if sending the mail fails. # This logs + suppresses all exceptions. with ErrorBoundary(): django.core.mail.send_mail(...) return HttpResponse(...) Of course this can be very useful in non-Django Python code as well!
You can do that in 2.x if you dig deep enough into ctypes and shit.
there is also a tool with the same name, that can complain about your code and point problematic areas
end of year homework alert
Maybe I'm just not seeing it, but what benefit does one get by adding this dependency which does seemingly the same thing as a `try`-`catch` block except a lot less explicit? Blanket suppression of exceptions such as this seems potentially pretty dangerous. Not to mention -- if I may -- quite lazy. Instead, I'd argue the developer should know which exceptions are possible during a given operation and should construct their procedures with those cases in mind (documenting, logging as necessary). Don't mean to come off as rude or anything; it's just this sort of thing is near-and-dear to me. Been burned one-too-many times by developers cutting corners on exception handling.
This hack is not needed if you use py.test. 
That 'Head First Python' book cover is cringeworthy.
Yeah, I read it... but I don't really understand the difference between last-modified and the example I have :( d = feedparser.parse('http://feedparser.org/docs/examples/atom10.xml') d.modified_parsed this is what they give, which can be shortened to feedparser.parse('http://feedparser.org/docs/examples/atom10.xml').modified_parsed What's the difference between .modified_parsed and .published_parsed? How come one downloads the entire feed while the other doesn't?
the tool is now called "pycodestyle"
&gt; Maybe I'm just not seeing it, but what benefit does one get by adding this dependency which does seemingly the same thing as a try-catch block except a lot less explicit? It's more readable and less error-prone than having hundreds of these in your code: try: something_i_dont_really_care_about() except: logging.exception("Error in something I don't really care about") &gt; Blanket suppression of exceptions such as this seems potentially pretty dangerous. Not to mention -- if I may -- quite lazy. Instead, I'd argue the developer should know which exceptions are possible during a given operation and should construct their procedures with those cases in mind (documenting, logging as necessary). True, that's why it isn't really blanket suppression. You still got logging (we have it wired up to Sentry so will be notified of every error). I argue that it's impractical to have to know all the possible errors that may happen with third-party code, and add explicit error handling for all of them. Some errors are very rare and I don't really care about some stuff failing (like sending performance/KPI metrics to some external service). Other stuff I care about, but isn't critically important and easy to fix after the fact (like adding someone to a Mailchimp list). Not having explicit error handling for every possible error isn't lazy, it's getting things done :)

Not all feeds will include the `Last-Modified` or `ETag` headers in their response, but let's assume they do for this example. When you make a request to a server, it'll include a `Last-Modified` and/or `ETag` header within its response. This gives you a datetime-identifier in the case of a `Last-Modified` header and entity-identifier in the case of an `ETag` header. Using feedparser, you can find these values with the `etag` and `modified` attributes. Hang on to those values for use on your next request to that server. When you decid to check the feed again, include the `If-Modified-Since` header using the datetime-identifier (Last-Modified) and/or the `If-None-Match` header using the entity-identifier (ETag). If the values you've just sent with your request have not changed, you will receive a response with status code `304` (Not Modified) and no content w/in the body. However, if feed has since been updated, you will receive all the content as usual. From there, you'll once again extract the `Last-Modified` and/or `ETag` header values for use the next time you make a request for this resource. Using feedparser, you would include an `ETag` value using the `etag` argument and a `Last-Modified` value using the `modified` argument in `parse`, such as: response = feedparser.parse('https://example.com/feed/', etag=my_etag_value) or response = feedparser.parse('https://example.com/feed/', modified=my_last_modified_value) If the content has not changed, the value for `response.status` will be `304` and the value for `response.feed` will be and empty dict (if I remember correctly) So, something like this will work: import feedparser feed_url = 'https://example.com/feed/' # Very first time requesting this resource response = feedparser.parse(feed_url) # Extract the Last-Modified and/or ETag header values from the response etag_value = response.etag last_modified_value = response.modified # Save the value(s) for later when you make your next request # Fast-forward through time a little bit... go to make another request for this feed. response = feedparser.parse(feed_url, etag=etag_value) # or feedparser.parse(feed_url, modified=last_modified_value) # Check the response status code if response.status == 304: # The content has not changed and there is no new content w/in the response else: # The content has changed, proceed as normal, making sure to extract the new header values new_feed_content = response.feed new_etag_value = response.etag new_last_modified_value = response.modified # Save the new header values to use later on # Rinse, repeat ------------------------ Reference (RFC's): - [ETag](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7232#section-2.3) - [Last-Modified](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7232#section-2.2)
It is very simple Check if you have pip installed in your environment vars by typing "pip" into the cmd. pip is a package management system that comes with python. So, if you get a result that prints out all the different commands you can use with pip, then you are good to go, you have pip installed. If it says 'pip' is not recognized as an internal or external command, then you don't have pip, and you should google how to install python with pip. Next step would be to run "pip install pygame" to actually install pygame. Note that this will require you to run the cmd as administrator because it has to create and modify some directories. Then it will automatically download and install pygame to your python. And TADAA, thats all.
Another aspect is if you're looking for a job, then having experience in 3.5+ makes your profile much more appealing than if you've solely worked in 2.7. Even if you pursue a place in a company where they use 2.7 I believe you would not be rejected for having moved to python 3 after 10 years. While in the opposite case, there are plenty professionals that would not accept you unless you demonstrate the skill of being adaptive and in sync with the latest tools and technologies. 
I’ll add that, in general, changing the design of your code to make it more testable leads to a better design. It’s one of the reasons why TDD — writing the tests along with the code — is so effective.
Try to change interpreter in PyCharm.
Have you checked out Mayavi? It is awesome for visualization stuff.
Kivy comes with several demo applications. Try running one of those and see if it can find a window provider. I ran into this same error when trying to bring my code from Ubuntu into Mac OS while rebuilding a mobile app. My kivy install on the iMac was biffed, and so had to reinstall it 3 times before I caught that the ftp was being blocked by my work's firewall. Once it was whitelisted, I was able to install and run everything.
im a network administrator who is working towards using it in my field and anywhere i can understand it better (started as a class but apparently its becoming a big thing in this field to use)
Awesome, sounds cool! Best wishes with your third deployment! &gt; Is there any one particular area/field you feel more drawn to than others? I've was initially drawn to finance ....because of the availability of the data. I enjoyed learning about basic ML stuff, but it wasn't very useful overall. Once I learned about deep learning, that's basically consumed me :P I'm always thinking about projects that I could do with deep learning now.
I built this a while back (if you're familiar with the Ansible APIs you'll see it's running on Ansible 1.4) but thought it would be of interest to those here. There's a long story behind this, but I had to control upgrades/deployments in a specific way and the easiest way I could think of at the time was to run Ansible from a Message Queue. I originally had an Ansible RESTful API I built but some of the jobs would take too long and another piece of this would timeout waiting for a response. Thought you guys might be interested since it's all Python. If you see anything in the code that I'm doing wrong, let me know, Python isn't my strong point.
Requests for help of this sort belong in /r/learnpython, but what you've written here isn't up to the standards for that subreddit either.
I would be quite cautious projects on your github. While it's a good way to show off, it can really backfire if the code on there isn't up to your usual standards. I would make your projects private, and then spend some time really polishing one or two to make public. Pay particular attention to the quality and cleanliness of your code, rather than focusing on improving functionality or UI.
Ha! you right, but ctype is not quite easy to use. Also, some "define" such as `CMSG_FIRSTHDR` in the header cannot be used in python code (you have to implement them again). It's really painful :(
I think you would need to use specialized collection objects for such cases (namedtuple being a good fit here).
You've never heard of github, then?
came across [this](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/tutorial/linalg.html). it's also based on numpy but it specifically says &gt; When SciPy is built using the optimized ATLAS LAPACK and BLAS libraries, it has very fast linear algebra capabilities. If you dig deep enough, all of the raw lapack and blas libraries are available for your use for even more speed. In this section, some easier-to-use interfaces to these routines are described. [that](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-dev/user/numpy-for-matlab-users.html) may also be helpful in your case. I got this after a very brief googling so I hope i am not showing something you already know very well. still, it really got my curiosity. what do you consider 'large' in a matrix? 10x10? 10^3 x 10^3 ?
I gave up at “To be fair, all the contestants (including Go) were running a single-worker process.” That is not fair and not how the majority of these servers should be configured or deployed. Benchmarking is hard. 
The block for December 5th is missing. 
A) /r/learnpython B) If you indent all of you code with four spaces, it will format properly a = raw_input() b = [int (octet) for octet in a.split(".")] if b[0] in range(1,256): if (b[0]&gt;=1 and b[0]&lt;=127): print "class A" elif (b[0]&gt;=128 and b[0]&lt;=191): print "class B" elif (b[0]&gt;=192 and b[0]&lt;=223): print "class C" elif (b[0]&gt;=224 and b[0]&lt;=239): print "class D" elif(b[0]&gt;=240 and b[0]&lt;=254): print "class E" else:print "bad input" C) Is there a reason you are doing this in 2.7? If you put parentheses around `print` and then add a conditional to `input` vs `raw_input`, it will be compatible with 2 &amp; 3 D) You do **not** need parentheses around statement such as `if`, `elif`, etc E) White `int (val)` will work, it looks odd and sloppy. do `int(val)` F) &gt; I need to make it in a for loop 20 times. plz help me with that Really? Have you tried **anything** at all? for count in range(20): print(count) 
All gone again? :/
&gt; Gitlab is free I prefer it like this more :-) Various reasons.
You could also contribute to a couple of open source projects (preferably the ones with contributing guidelines) . Having some of your PRs merged should show that you can write quality code, as it has to be vetted by others (at least in theory). 
Tbh I wouldn't bother. This isn't a "I don't understand this" question, it's a "do my programming 101 homework" question. 
Is there a way to manage more dependency classes than production and dev? For example, I install ipython in basically all of my environments for my own use, but it's not actually a dependency of the project, or required for someone else to develop it, so I don't want it ending up in the pipfile.
I prefer it like this more :-) Various reasons. 
I get a 404
By "neat tricks" I think you mean horrible ways to abuse the language to make unreadable, incomprehensible, undebuggable, obfuscated mess. Or Code Golf. Same thing really.
You should specify its code golfing tricks in the title. In everyday code these are the worst idea. 
This is a very good idea IMO. You can show teamwork alongside your coding abilities, and it gives back to the community. You don't have to come up with ideas yourself, either. Just go implement a bunch of bug fixes for your favorite projects. 
offtopic, but I wish there was a way to run custom scripts like these directly in the car. Running it on the phone I am basically tracking myself, but I'd rather track *the car*. Also I tend to flip between radio stations quite a bit, having a saved view of my listening habits would help me remember "that program I heard once on Radio 3". Something like this would just need a sandbox that can only access the internet, gps. and the entertainment system in read-only mode, and maybe save text files in a small memory with a dedicated API. It could be made very safe very easily, and it would open up a world of possible services. Are you listening, car manufacturers? Gimme the hackermobile ;)
Um... there's no limit to the possible errors you can get in coding. There is literally an infinite number of possible syntax errors alone: x +$ y x - )y x y 1.1.2 + 1 (1, 2, , , , , 3) y := x + 1 def function a b c: is just a few. Then you get runtime errors: there are dozens of possible file system errors, memory errors, type errors, text encoding and decoding errors, floating point errors, errors connecting to HTTP servers, errors connecting to sockets, network time outs... Can you explain what you are actually trying to learn here?
Thanks! 
Thanks!
oh man. i really hope i just overlooked that. i will definitely try just porting it to scipy directly. thanks for bringing this to my attention. these are huge matrices. (300-500+ sensors x time). i have to reduce dimensionality before i can even try to process it. 
Ha would be really cool if you could manage to get rid of matlab
I admit I have use this many times. `if sys.args[1:2] == ["-h"]`
Fixed... :)
Fixed... :)
Door 2 is open 🎅🌧☃️❄️🌟
But not a word about the ability to do data visualization! What if you need to plot? Do either or both of these offer extensions that make that possible or even easy? [I am currently using Spyder, which is great for plotting].
 &gt;&gt;&gt;import this
Thanks for the heads up. It was more of a url + redirection issue
WTF if anyone who worked for me wrote this shit I would tell them to either rewrite it or comment in a step-by-step documentation in the comments, meaning rewrite it.
Hmm, good question. You could install ipython globally, but that's not the greatest, either. Yeah, I'm ok with forcing anyone who uses my project to use pipenv, that gives me greater confidence that they are using it correctly.
Installing ipython globally would mean you wouldn't have access to the packages installed in your project environment, though.
I mean both IDEs are being continuously updated, calling one 7 years old when VS itself has been around for over a decade isn't the most honest.
Thanks!
You might have to set up your PATH variables. This is done through windows settings: 'environment variables'. You can find how to do this for python specifically online, its not too difficult! Then in cmd type: Pip install pygame Then it installs for you automatically. All you have to do is import the module into code!
&gt; VS Code does not let you set the PYTHONPATH. [Yes it does](http://i.imgur.com/k2ciOrw.png).
Okay, so I took a look at your class, and it looks like `execute_sql` is just wrapping up getting the cursor, and then the `fetch_all` if there's anything to fetch For me, this comes under the umbrella of testing other people's code, and due to the fact that there's not a great deal of your own logic involved, just assuring yourself that it's simple enough to work. That said, you'd easily be able to use the examples I gave previously to make sure `get_cursor` and `fetch_all` were being passed the correct arguments, without having to actually make the DB call. Hope this helps!
I've met grad students who think this is a good idea. I hate them so much.
None of what you said is true though... You can set a custom pythonpath and virtualenv interpreter as well.. You can also jump straight when you click on an error message. 
For the lazy here are some of the main highlights: * A simplified URL routing syntax that allows writing routes without regular expressions. * A responsive, mobile-friendly contrib.admin. * Window expressions to allow adding an OVER clause to querysets. I was ok with the regular expressions but it's cool to see them make it a bit easier. Usually you would write this: url(r'^articles/(?P&lt;year&gt;[0-9]{4})/$', views.year_archive), Now you can write this instead: path('articles/&lt;int:year&gt;/', views.year_archive), Much cleaner.
PyCharm just got a huge speed boost in their latest release. They ported a bunch of their source code to Cython I believe.
I have no issue setting the proper Python interpreter. The PYTHONPATH variable contains the directories where the interpreter looks for imports. In VS Code you are supposed to create a .env file and put a path there. For me it works for linting and code completion as it should, but not in the terminal. If I execute the file, it fails on import. 
Code golf is for fun, not for production.
This is not the PYTHONPATH variable. This is just the path to the interpreter you want to use. I want to set the directory where the interpreter looks for libraries. See my answer to /u/Bluer123 for some more details. 
In my Opinion the best way is to use Pycharm. Install it and everything is ready to go, there are also nice features as in VSC but they are working properly...
&gt; Window expressions to allow adding an OVER clause to querysets. Can someone explain what this means? 
&gt; You can set a custom pythonpath and virtualenv interpreter as well.. This is not what I want to do. &gt; You can also jump straight when you click on an error message. For me it jumps to the file, not the line. Not very useful. Technically VS Code supports what I want to do by creating a .env file in the root directory. But it does not work for me for whatever reason. Tried on both Linux and Windows. Linting and Intellisense property adapts to the variable set in .env, but I still can not execute the file. Maybe I am doing something wrong? How do you guys execute your python files?
I recommend HackerRank.com. It's the way I learned Python. It presents key parts of the language in a series of fun and challenging exercises. If you get stuck, you can discuss the problems with people that has been working on it as well. It also has plenty of other stuff to learn that are valuable for a data scientist, such as SQL, Statistics, Mathematics, Distributed Systems, etc.
This is fantastic, thank you!
I hate regular expressions, this alone makes me want to upgrade all my projects to 2.0.
Why not just use .get? Compare to actual string or none
I've been maintaining credit models using R and Python for the last months. I have to say, I love R. It was my first professional language. But working in Python and R in parallel these days made me appreciate how much of a difference it makes to work on a language so syntactically clean as Python.
I think the biggest highlight is that it's dropping support for python2
Depending on which database you are using, Google "SQL Window Functions". ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY ORDER BY) may be the most commonly used. Window Functions are helpful because you can apply the function across rows without having to do a group by and multiple selects (you only have to read the data once).
All the backwards compatibility nonsense has been rigorously gutted out as far as I've seen. The code is so much cleaner now.
Just say no to Django. Their whole business model is creating avoidable work for tens of thousands of developers around the world by breaking backwards compatibility with each and every minor version. Don't fall for this or you'll end up running an old and vulnerable Django version because your client is no longer willing to pay thousands of dollars each year for work that is not adding new features, nor fixing existing bugs. The fact that they are dropping Python2 should help with that decision. Let the perpetual newbies who drank the Kool-Aid of Python3 learn the hard way.
&gt; Usually you would write this: &gt; &gt; url(r'^articles/(?P&lt;year&gt;[0-9]{4})/$', views.year_archive), &gt; &gt; Now you can write this instead: &gt; &gt; path('articles/&lt;int:year&gt;/', views.year_archive), It's obviously not the same thing. In the first version you specify how many digits you are accepting while in the second one you don't.
&gt; I hate regular expressions Have you considered a career change? Programmers usually love DSLs in general and regular expressions in particular.
Oh for fuck's sake man, let python2 go already
I took it off the documentation on the page. Not my example.
Selenium already uses a headless browser - either Chrome or Firefox.
&gt; Oh for fuck's sake man, let python2 go already Right after we let go of Perl5, Cobol and Fortran.
I'm almost positive that it isn't run with headless chrome.
Selenium can work with multiple browsers. It may be Chrome or Firefox or even Internet Explorer, but it's still a headless web browser of some sort.
&gt; I took it off the documentation on the page. Not my example. Oh, it's OK then. You just copy pasted something you don't actually understand. Isn't Python3 awesome?
Just change the webdriver in your code to use Chromedriver instead.
Then what extensions might you suggest to make my program function faster? I was thinking uBlock or possibly an extension to block the loading of images.
What website are you working with? Can you do it with Requests instead of a full web browser? Do they have an API you can use?
He obviously didn't say it's the exact same thing, so you obviously can cool off.
I'm unsure exactly of what requests do. Are requests requesting the HTTP and submitting it directly or something along those lines? I'm using supremenewyork.com
It's time to switch to Python 3, which was released in 2008
[Requests](https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests) is a library for making HTTP requests directly, yes.
So you also fixed a Y10K but in the process. Double win.
Would I still be able to add an item to cart and select the size within a drop down in the webpage and then click (or request) checkout? I apologize for my ignorance.
&gt; It's time to switch to Python 3, which was released in 2008 And Perl6 which was [available since 2005](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pugs_(programming\)), right?
Yes, but you will need to manually form the correct request, by parsing the HTML of the page.
Are you confusing Django’s versioning scheme with semantic versioning? Django 1.10, 1.11, and 2.0 are three major revisions. Everything in between those are usually bug/patch releases. 
My opinion about VBA is simply: WITHIN the scope of the Office file ONLY - the fact is it is the right/best programming tool/option for it - i.e. none of that dirtyass fucking Windows function/objects calls. &gt; The unavailability of source control is horrible. LOL wut ? you mean MS Office ?
My program already clicks all the correct information to work. Would there be a way to simply add requests into my program to make it function.
No, that is not possible. Requests is _not_ a browser, and does not know what "clicking" is.
&gt; Are you confusing Django’s versioning scheme with semantic versioning? Django 1.10, 1.11, and 2.0 are three major revisions. Everything in between those are usually bug/patch releases. https://github.com/django/django/blob/01f658644a7ee7cbff4ee5626d5894e9049ee8d5/docs/internals/howto-release-django.txt#L420
But would it be able to complete a series of tasks that would add an item to my cart, input credit card and other personal information and then check out?
Bug/patch in the semver sense. Major/minor/patch for Django is not the same as for semver.
Yes.
You have misconfigured your vscode. Once you set the interpreter using the command pallete, you are able to right click and send file to terminal. This will automatically use the interpreter (which has all the imports you want). You either haven't set up your envs properly, or you are installing your packages into a different python interpreter and not pointing VScode to it. 
&gt; business model It isn't a business, it's an open source project. And Django 1.11 is getting security fixes until 2020 - not bad for free!
&gt; It isn't a business, it's an open source project. How many core developers make a living by offering Django consulting services (i.e. fixing what they just broke)? &gt; not bad for free Yes, it's bad when a project abuses its users, and it's unrelated to the fact that the software is free. To put it another way, giving it away for free does not protect you from criticism, just from legal action.
What do you recommend instead?
Pycharm is way better than any text editor out there for Python development. Virtualenv integration, docker integration all are first class and you don't need to fight your editor to do a basic thing like looking into the library code. With some configuration, it might be possible in editors like Code or Sublime but what's the point when everything just works with Pycharm. Also, navigating any medium to a big project is a task with editors as they don't have any contextual indices to give relevant information. The Python3 type annotations support is nicely integrated too. Just look at the feature set, I don't think any editor matches it https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/whatsnew/ P.S. Was coding in Vim all the time before for almost 5 years. Nothing against the editors, just that coding productively is much easier with Pycharm. 
Maybe you run with a different crowd, but I've never met someone who was like 'damn I love me some regex'. Yes, it's amazing when you basically write an incantation to do what you want, because it's real powerful, but you don't need to love writing it to be A True Programmer.
Just because it was released a while ago doesn't mean it's necessarily better right. That's like saying any new version that has aged is necessarily better than a new version. Like consider Angular 1v2 or whatever else changed a lot between version.
So you never do any serverside validation on user input?
It sure is! 
&gt; So you never do any serverside validation on user input? URL regex matching is server side validation. Why would you think otherwise?
It's also nice that in the new system, you can retrieve articles written during the late Roman empire, without specifying the leading zeroes, and even access articles from the Greek empire, (albeit with an off-by-one issue due to the missing year zero).
Seriously, I haven't met anyone who loves regex, it's more like a necessary evil
My father-in-law does. He gets positively giddy about them. I find them cool and useful. But I'm not exactly looking them up for fun (like he does).
This isn't hard, actually. Get yourself a Raspberry Pi and a shield to talk to your car's CAN bus.
I like this idea a lot. Whenever I look at a candidate's Github I get excited when I see an open source project, and then I realize it's just a dead-end fork. I'd be very impressed if I saw someone who's actually merged code into living project.
They’re fucking magic. When I switched from MySQL to BigQuery and Postgres, I rewrote tons of python row by row bs and replaced it with a couple window functions.

Visit "Password Locker" made in Python... What do you think? What improvements should I do when writing next post?
The `--site-packages` flag should enable access to globally installed packages ([source](https://github.com/kennethreitz/pipenv/issues/644)).
Maybe not in general, but in this case Python 3 (as of 3.5 or 3.6) is significantly better than 2.7.

Plotting requires one more dimension than your data. Imagine plotting f(x), you do so with x and y axes - this is 2D! Now imagine plotting f(x,y) - you usually do this with x and y axes, and use color/height/contours to denote the value at each point. Plotting 3D data is, in broad terms, a hard problem. Often what is done is to animate the plot over time to scan through one of the dimensions. If your data is point-like and not mesh or surface like, then you can use MPL's 3D capabilities for a 3D scatter plot, and use color or dot size as the function value. This may/will not be the most visually pleasing. Axes3D.scatter is what you would use for that, see https://matplotlib.org/mpl_toolkits/mplot3d/tutorial.html since you are plotting a wave equation and one of your variables is called t, it seems there is already a temporal dimension to the data, in which case plotting f(x,y) with t animating over time semes very sensible. For that you would make your x/y meshgrid and loop over t, applying your wave equation for each time value independently. Use plt.imshow or plt.pcolorfast to draw the data. ---- On a different comment, your code is going to be a lot slower than it needs to be and has a few smelly bits. The function `plot_Laplace` taking a figure number as an argument is extremely fragile. Your equations are in a separate submodule, which seems very unnecessary, and you iterate your numpy arrays with a list comprehension, which is like a one-liner for loop. In effect, you have unvectorized numpy and your code will run hundreds to thousands of times slower. It would be better if it were rewrote in this fashion, def laplace_equation(x, y, r): return x + y + r def share_fig_ax(fig=None, ax=None): if fig is None and ax is None: fig = plt.figure() ax = fig.add_subplot(111, projection='3d') elif fig is None: fig = ax.get_figure() elif ax is None: ax = fig.gca() return fig, ax def plot_laplace(x_range, y_range, r, fig=None, ax=None): xmin, xmax, inc_x = x_range ymin, ymax, inc_y = y_range x, y = np.arange(xmin, xmax, inc_x), np.arange(ymin, ymax, inc_y) xx, yy = np.meshgrid(y,x) # note y, x flipped -- column-major order semantics of numpy z = laplace_equation(xx, yy, r) fig, ax = share_fig_ax(fig, ax) i = ax.imshow(z, extent=[xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax], # spatial coordinates the image draws in origin='lower', # origin lower makes this a "data like" view, with 0 in the lower left interpolation='Lanczos') # nice interpolation, could also use None, "nearest", etc. fig.colorbar(i) return fig, ax Keep the contents of your equations in terms of simple things (addition, subtraction, exponentiation, etc) which numpy will broadcast and iterate internally for you. If you need cosines and sines or other trig, use the np.cos family of functions, which can work with arrays.. `share_fig_ax` is a nifty function that allows you to pass a figure and axis to plot in, or not, and the `plot_laplace` function will continue to work as expected. A figure handle is much less error prone than a figure number! You can extract your min max and inc variables with a single line, which is compact and more readable. The code above will run much faster than, and is more terse and readable than what you posted. If you write your code like this, your programs will be shorter and easier to understand!
So, 5-10 years ago is good for you? Done.
So at this stage of the game, I assume that Python 3 is the way to go for pretty much everything now?
You should definitely consider renaming the subreddit to PythonNews then. The current name is confusing.
Nice

Not easily. It's a Python compiled extension, and requires large chunks of the Python runtime to be present.
Who peed in your coffee this morning? It's obvious you're not a django fan. Fine. Stop trolling and move on, unless you have something relevant and useful to contribute.
Okay, so follow up question: Basically what I wanted was all my code to be compiled into some kind of standalone executable, so I ws thinking of just creating a .so from my python code, then creating a .c file and calling the methods I want in it and then just linking and compiling. I've also heard of cx_Freeze for python, and I tried using it, but it just gives me the error that module `encodings` not found, even though when I go under build/&lt;folder&gt;/lib/ I can see an encodings folder (and the module is present on the host too). So any idea how I can fix that? Please ask for any logs required and also tell me if this is going a bit off topic from this thread and if I should start a new thread Thanks for replying :)
If your goal is to distribute a Python app as a self-contained executable, cx_Freeze or PyInstaller is the way to go. If one doesn't work for you, try the other. 
Thank you for helping with more than I asked for! I already solved the Membrane thing but will adapt it to my code. May I ask about: &gt;xx, yy = np.meshgrid(y,x) # note y, x flipped -- column-major order semantics of numpy All examples I have seen so far have it as X, Y = np.meshgrid(x,y) not (y,x)? But when I changed it with my code, result looked more "right"
Pycharm 2017.3 added scientific mode. It adds some kind of data viewer that I've never used, and integration with matplotlib. However that's not in the free version. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHwh0c8UsW4&amp;t=66
You are in a python sub, why are you bringing those up? But yeah while we are at it give those up too for newer versions. 
&gt; Let the perpetual newbies who drank the Kool-Aid of Python3 learn the hard way. Dude what does that mean?
Sure -- numpy stores arrays in column-major order. This means that for a 2D array, the first dimension corresponds to columns, "y", and the second corresponds to rows, "x." If you have a function of x and y, this means you need to give it arguments in y,x order since y is the first dimension. That is kind of inverted, logically, for me. You could do y, x = np.meshgrid(x,y) for the same effect, but we often scan code by looking at what variables are made where -- e.g. the code I wrote scans as "get x, y stuff. make a grid, compute f, make figures" without looking at much beyond the start of the lines. You could also do `xx, yy = np.meshgrid(x, y, indexing='xy')` and get the same effect, but this is less terse. It's more explicit, which is probably better, but I've gotten in the habit of switching y,x in my meshgrid calls.
I changed it to np.meshgrid(x,y, indexing='xy') and it gave the same results as meshgride(x,y), my default indexing was 'xy', I guess?
So as a beginner to both python and django, should I use 2.0 or 1.11?
&gt; It's obvious you're not a django fan. It's also obvious that I'm a Django user. &gt; move on I wish I could.
&gt; You are in a python sub, why are you bringing those up? Perspective.
&gt; Dude what does that mean? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drinking_the_Kool-Aid
VS autocomplete is arse, but I don't know if in this case it's supposed to do that or not. Python autocomplete is a bit of a hit and miss affair as the tools can't work it out. In my experience Jedi and Pycharm have the best two. Pycharm's is slightly better overall, but top level seems worse than Jedi. However once you're below top level, it's unbeaten.
Finishing up work on a data warehouse process that’s using Django as its ETL. Next up is an automated aws scheduler, and moving some Django code into python 3, Docker and lambda. 
Thus breaking the isolation of my environment :P
Means that this person is full of bitterness, yet obviously has nothing useful to say. Usually this happens when people had a hard time learning to use something and then a newer release lowers the entry level, thus they are bitter for having done the extra work before.
Lol I meant why do you have against Python 3?
Yeah, well you were looking for other options, that's all I can think of 🙂
I don’t worry too much about my GitHub. I would focus on getting your bachelors, and your work experience should open some doors. As a portfolio, if you do want to include stuff from your github, make a project that fits the field you want to be in - and focus on code cleanliness, comments, unit tests, etc. 
Benefits of using 1.11 is that you will find plenty of information on the web if you find yourself stuck with something specific to the version 1.x. However it is not obsolete, and 2.0 has some pretty neat features. Benefits of 2.0 are that you will be learning the version that is default both for the framework and the language (since it supports Python 3 only), but you get the chance of running into an issue that isn't documented yet, because it might be specific to the 2.0 release. I would start with 1.11 because of community support, documented issues and the fact that you can use Python 3 with it. Migrating to 2.0 later should be easy.
Have you tried installing Ctags (it is recommended in the quick start list)?
Depends what for. It's not very good for poaching eggs
I love regexps, but they aren't a good solution for url routing.
&gt; what do you have against Python 3? It has all the drawbacks of switching to another language and none of the benefits.

You're a nutbag. Django has saved me a shit-tonne of work by providing basic building components for a website so I don't have to roll my own buggy insecure version. Not to mentione the time saved by using their ORM over writing SQL manually.
I could take or leave writing them, but when there is no other tool for the job, its invaluable.
Angular 1 never existed. AngularJS and Angular are totally different unrelated projects
Actually... I'm reading through your comments here and I'm just seeing lots of anti-django/python3 comments but no clear reasoning to why. There's no perspective, just angst.
&gt; no clear reasoning to why &gt; Perhaps you could explain yourself a bit better? Perhaps you could read a bit better? https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/7h3bbh/django_20_released/dqnt8kv/ : &gt; Don't fall for this or you'll end up running an old and vulnerable Django version because your client is no longer willing to pay thousands of dollars each year for work that is not adding new features, nor fixing existing bugs.
Hello all I am creating a student grading menu where I can enter in students grades for two quiz grades, but then I would also like to pull up a student from the file by searching for their name and for my third function I would like it to print out a full report of all the students. Thank you!
&gt; You're a nutbag and (some) comments ate borderline irrational. That's the spirit! Criticism should be met with *ad hominem* attacks and the heretics burned at stake!
Try /r/learnpython. Be sure to [format your code for reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/faq#wiki_how_do_i_format_code.3F) or use a site like pastebin. Also, include which version of python and what OS you are using. 
Wow, regex gatekeeping. Programmers, being a diverse group of people, love different things. This may surprise you, but some programmers don’t even find technology intrinsically interesting, and are only interested in the end product!
&gt; This may surprise you, but some programmers don’t even find technology intrinsically interesting, and are only interested in the end product! That's like some Formula 1 pilots not finding cars interesting and just wanting to win races.
I read just fine. You need to explain better with less snark. You could always start with a version with LTS which minimis the breaking changes to near zero but still receive latest security patches. I don't see the issue with changes upon release. Software changes, things need to be updated of you're using a framework. It's a fact for software development.
Dude, not everyone is like you. 
&gt; You need to explain better with less snark. Don't blame me for your reading comprehension failures. &gt; I don't see the issue with changes upon release. People who actually use it in production see these issues quite clearly - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15832874 : &gt; I really dread upgrading Django. We have a codebase that has been with us since the 1.3 days and each time there's an upgrade, someone on the team sets about one month aside to deal with all of the breakage. You could say that this is our fault for "doing it wrong" but we just wanna get stuff done. Sometimes the only way to do it that we could figure out was by doing something that Django later decided we shouldn't have done. &gt;Going to Python 3 is going to be the biggest annoyance yet. 
The package I want to use is a custom one. It's not installed in any environment, it's just a git repository I clone to my drive in a specific version and then use it in my project. I have no trouble using a certain interpreter or env. This works fine for me. I set the environment variable as I should using the .env file. It just does not seem to be applied everywhere. Certainly not in the terminal.
That's fucking amazing! Thanks for sharing!
You can use a custom path converter if this is really a big deal https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/topics/http/urls/#registering-custom-path-converters
Such generosity!
&gt; support for Python 2.7 is removed Really glad to see that more and more projects are finally doing this :D
"I'm too lazy to learn Python 3, so I deserve free Python 2 support for eternity."
Preaching to the converted 
oh - sorry, that last big was wrong of my to say. If you have a 2D array in python, the first index is columns, or y. If you want it to behave like it's first index for x, you need to switch x and y.
"I'm too lazy to learn Python 3, so I deserve free support for outdated versions forever."
I did not know this, thank you.
&gt; I hate regular expressions Such a silly sentiment for a developer.. to hate one of your tools.
Ignoring your snark, thats going nowhere. Excuse me for my ignorance but I've been upgrading django production sites in my job for many years, some since django 1.2. The process is generally painless. Deprecations are coupled with a warning in the console and breaking changes 500 loudly so you know exactly what to fix. It only takes about a day to upgrade. Test will always be subject to project complexity, so maybe a day or more if you're working on a fairly big project. Shouldnt be more difficult than running your unit tests then fixing whatever fails right? "setting a month aside" just sounds like a poorly managed project with no automated testing or whoever upgrading is just slacking.
**Nooooooo!** 
I love my job but do I have to like every aspect of it? I like straightforward and leggible code that's why I love Python, I don't like a seemingly random string of characters representing a desired pattern which I have to decipher to understand.
In Django, models are not validated when using `create` using the default manager (say `Person.objects.create(name='John')`). It was said that this was due to backwards compatibility, I wonder why was this not fixed in 2.0
Or you could just at least try to verify it before making an ass of yourself. https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/
Nice cherry pick Know what that says to me? That the team prioritized hacking on top of hacks on top of piss poor design, architecture and code. So when their technical debt bites them in the ass, their only response is to bitch, moan and complain. Rather than actually doing anything to help future proof the project 
Yay! We have a billion of these annoying regex URL routes in our code base I've been wanting to get rid of. Now I just have to convince my teammates to upgrade our system to Python 3... probably gotta get off of Ubuntu 14 in our infrastructure first though :/
&gt; I don't like a seemingly random string of characters representing a desired pattern which I have to decipher to understand. You just described language in general.
You;re just bitching and moaning over here. Nothing's forcing you to stay here, just your own self. Don't like it, _do_ something about it. 
LPTHW got updated to Py3. 
Under extreme protest, apparently. Doesn't change my opinion that Zed Shaw is an asshole from the way he carried on like a baby.
Pretty sure we always knew that 2.0 would
AFAIK, some things like passing loop everywhere will go away. But yes, some parts of asyncio was bad designed, but don't throw rocks, since only experience of programming with asyncio gave chance for curio and trio to born. More to say, ok, curio and trio is good, but this is base framework and without libraries it is pretty useless. I don't think, that 3rd base frameworks will be more popular, than asyncio. Only in case if 3rd base framework will support asyncio libs, they will have chance to go.
Right!. I've had this work around in place for way too long. I'm excited to get back and try it, i don't have access to the raw data on my laptop. The actual math itself is straightforward so porting it is trivial once I figure out the scipy markup. In what context are you using scipy? You seem to know a fair bit about the underlying support algorithm. Being able to do the logic entirely in one language would be awesome. There are folks that will never convert from R or Matlab as they know their approaches are proven and don't trust anyone to port them. I'll still have to use R and Matlab for those cases, but for my projects where I have ultimate control, hell ya I'm gonna keep is straight python
It's still an improvement from whatever this guy is saying. I don't like the book myself, and the refusal to migrate was silly, but at least it happened.
&gt; the responses to that comment you link seem to mirror my experiences. Django is quite simple to upgrade. You missed this one - https://news.ycombinator.com/reply?id=15832934&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D15832874%2315832934 : &gt; Huh. At my last job, we went from 1.7 to 1.11 and while it wasn't seamless, I suspect we spent about that much actual work time making upgrade-related changes/fixes (120ish person-hours) for all of those upgrades combined. 120 hours times $100/h for a US developer makes $12,000 of avoidable work for just one project. Now multiply this for all Django deployments in production and you'll see my point - it's not that fixing the monthly breakage is complicated, it's that it costs money and it could have been avoided by treating us Django users with respect.
I dunno, hook up the right stuff to an Arduino....

There's a saying about regexps... You encounter a problem and decide to use a regular expression to solve it. Now you have two problems.
