&gt; try to model that as a numerical variable and consume that in the right way and before the market reacts as a whole Well, I am literally trying to do that. You are right though that your own effect on the market will play a huge unpredictable role. Which is why I think it's also important to constantly be modeling the effect of your actions on the market. In many thinly traded stocks it is very easy to move the market minute to minute with a trade of a dozen or hundred k. That's actually one of the more interesting effects to model because you can't do it in practice runs. I've seen the accuracy of predictions of a (non-AI) model for example go from 97% accurate in paper trading to only 60% accurate when the market started to respond to actual trades of a few hundred k, that was a pretty big eye opener.
Your pip is probably referring to a different version of python than the one you are using to run the code. Try putting this in the top of the file (just once) import pip pip.main(["install", "winshell"])
 pip --version At the end of the output line there is a python version shown. For me it its: pip 8.1.1 from /python/path (python 3.4)
RemindMe! 1 week Python neural networks 
If you haven't done so yet, dig in and profile your code to find your bottleneck. I know you mentioned you believe the culprit to be a certain function, but you'd gain a whole lot of insight after a bit of profiling. https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/profile.html
Given the fact that neural networks can "predict" any mathematical function, some basic examples would be trying to predict some math stuff. At least that is what I did. I made a neural net to add two numbers, for the sake of experimentation (played a lot with changing the number of hidden neurons and switching between neuron types to see how the neural net performs).
&gt; No module named 'matplotlib.pyplot I still not able to resolve my error **No module named 'matplotlib.pyplot** 
~a month ago I have finished a little [project](https://digits-draw-recognize.herokuapp.com/) for my portfolio, which could be of interest to you. The link to github is at the bottom of the page. At the top of the page you can see links to project description. On this site user can draw a digit and then this digit will be recognized by neural nets. There are two nets: simple feed forward net on numpy and CNN on Tensorflow. Models can be easily trained on home PC. I have collected the data for the project by myself - 1000 images and used data augmentation technics during training. Also the models are trained on the images which users draw; as a result accuracy steadily increases (at least theoretically).
Stop using self made loops and vectorize whenever possible! Native numpy operations are written in Fortran and are much faster. The first few weeks of Andrew Ngs Coursera deep learning course 1 (you can audit for free) will show you how to write an efficient logistic regression estimator. 
I mean, what does that line say? Did you check to see what the syntax error could be?
Based on that error, where you're currently trying to do: import matplotlib.pyplot Can you instead do: import matplotlib print("MATPLOTLIB={0}".format(matplotlib)) import matplotlib.pyplot In the resulting output, just before the error, you should see a line that begins with MATPLOTLIB and it *should* end with `matplotlib/__init__.py` ... what do you get? And please give me the whole output.
This is definitely what you have to do. Anytime you find yourself using Dataframe.loc or writing for loops for across a dataset then you should definitely look to vectorize. 
 cd Desktop/PumpBot Isn't valid python. That is a command you need to type in before calling your python script. 
Sure, this post is about syntactic differences though
even though this is prob your homework check this gist. Takes ~1 sec https://gist.github.com/Andrew62/1ec169fad18b6df6ef464ec8df246fc7
I don't know, the only two users in the machine (root and arcoex) can run the script properly, so I doubt that it's an user/permissions issue. Anyways, I've checked (the function was a combination of os and pwd), and the script is running as root, so there shouldn't be any user or permissions issue.
Through SSH I just log into my server, then run "python3 /bot/arcoex.py". And it works perfectly (until I close the SSH session, I mean.) At boot, I've made a systemd unit file that looks like this. [Unit] Description=Arcoex bot for Discord [Service] ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 /bot/arcoex.py WorkingDirectory=/bot [Install] WantedBy=multi-user.target Happy cake day, by the way.
I doubt that it's a permissions issue, though. I've given an explanation about why in my answer above you.
I'm already using the absolute path to the executable, though. I'll get started into logging, since several people have recommended me here that I should use it.
Would you mind sharing a resource about how to do either of those? Also, I doubt that it's a permission issue since the script is being ran as root at boot.
I'll do this and see if it helps.
Shameless plug: [Pynsist](http://pynsist.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is a tool I made to make Windows installers for Python programs. I used cx_Freeze+Innosetup for a couple of years before making this as an alternative.
Along with everyone else, it sounds like your code works fine but your permissions are not configured properly. Since you're trying to run this on boot, I would recommend checking out your startup script. If using CentoOs that would be your systemd file where you can specify user=me or on Ubuntu that's your init script where you can setuid me for example. You will also specify the full path to your python environment, working directory, and other variables. You can check the status of these scripts in the terminal to figure out why the program won't run. 
Thanks for the answer! Anyways, if you look at my other answers (that I've made recently, so I can't blame you for not reading them) the script is being launched as root, so there shouldn't be a permission issue. Just for the record, launching the script manually as root through SSH also works fine.
You can go anywhere with this. Why not make yourself a simple website and serve it locally? Like cooking? Have it display recipes for the week. Like exercise? Then randomize a workout for the day. Hook it up to a weather service and recommend what you should wear.
&gt; Is it something like sales data? It's a starch market. &gt; Both of those are the major and easy-to-obtain data features that will increase your accuracy of your NN by a factor. Does this mean you're still recommending trying out Neural Net?
The user you log in as does not necessarily have the same environment when running at boot or automatically from cron etc. As far as I can see you are dealing with the filesystem. Try hardcoding absolute paths for testing and see if that is the issue. 
I'll pm you the link in a bit.
While the path are not hardcoded, all of them are based on the absolute path of the script location (os.path.dirname(os.path.realpath(__file_\_)) Anyways, after some testing it seem like the problem lies on umlbox, unfortunately. Removing any mention of it in the code in the subprocess.Popen() makes the bot work as expected, even if it's systemd the one launching it. I've dumped the output of umlbox with verbose and there's nothing relevant, so I'm on a deadlock. I'll keep trying to fit it, but at least this time I'm fairly sure that I'm looking at the right direction.
Assuming that you are *absolutely positive* that the library actually is installed in the place you think it is, and you have double-checked and triple-checked, then I suspect a permissions error. My guess is that somehow the installed file isn't readable by the user you are running Python as.
You've installed it *twice*? That's no good. At *best* you're just wasting disk space with a redundant copy, but at worst you might be setting up some sort of weird conflict between the two. `Lib` is not for you to install into, that's for the standard library. (That rule, or guideline really, isn't enforced, but you really shouldn't install into `Lib`.) Installing into `Lib/site-packages` is the right thing to do. 
To help us help you debug this, please: - Post the FULL traceback, not just the final error message. Even if you think that the rest is not relevant, sometimes it is. - COPY and PASTE it, don't retype it from memory. - A link to the project's home page might sometimes be useful. - Post the full file listing, include any permissions and ownership, of the files in your `Lib/site-packages`. *All* the files, not just the one you think is relevant. Under Linux I'd run `ls -l`, I don't know what you do in Windows. Some variety of `dir` I presume. Again, copy and paste the output, don't retype it. The important thing is to be able to see the *exact* file names, full read/write permissions and ownership of the files. E.g. if the file is only readable by the Administrator user, it won't work if you run Python as a regular, unprivileged user. 
&gt; The culprit function seems to be the costFunction() which has the slow for loop. What makes you say that? Have you profiled your code? If so, please show the output of the profiler.
No.
It's a bad use case and almost certainly won't work, at least not generally / effectively.
When Python executes a line that does a numerical operation, e.g `a = b + c`, it performs a comically large amount of work. It has to locate `a`, `b` and `c` by looking up their names in hash tables, increment and decrement reference counters, call functions, what have you. If the operations you're asking Python to do are heavy-weight - I/O, calls to a math library, network stuff, string processing - then the Python overhead is negligible. If, however, the operation is simple - like simple integer math - then the overhead cost will likely trump the payload cost, and you get that Python is an order of magnitude slower than compiled languages. The usual workaround is to find some way to make your Python code call bigger operations. In math that's usually done by vectorizing the code, replacing `n` Python statement executions with one.
Apology for the delay.. **For where I am currently trying to do** : on my desktop created a .py file and executing through python shell. This is the I received before getting the error: **MATPLOTLIB=&lt;module 'matplotlib' from 'C:\\Users\\SHASWAT\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python36\\lib\\site-packages\\matplotlib\\__init__.py'&gt;** Apart from this, I'd like to know the what causes the problems comes up in these modules. Before this I installed and tried other modules too but never stucked these brain storming errors. Any clues how to avoid or debug these hair pulling errors? I even download some sample code from the web, tried to run but got errors which I don't understand. Is there any possibility that the sample code I downloaded is from earlier version of python and I have latest (3.6 version) python??
Did the server get updated or patched?
What is the name of the file you are running? The one on your Desktop? **Edit**: it **cannot** be named `matplotlib.py`... I found people via Google complaining of a similar issue and tried it myself, you can't import a package from within a file with the same name as the package.
Next project could to be use an existing model like Inception, etc. and just retrain the last model layer to classify on new sets of images. https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/image_retraining

Yes, apparently exchangelib got updated right around the time this stopped working. Other people are reporting the same things on Linux and Windows.
There aren't many compatible with Python 3.6, but all of them that did work ended up resulting in 100-200mb importing all packages (and giving errors upon excluding some of them) for what was less than 500 lines of code. Might as well install Python at that point.
Report it on the GitHub project issues page. He's pretty responsive and it likely won't take long to get if fixed..q

I managed to get it down to 0.1 seconds from 1.6 seconds (my processor is fairly high-end) I noticed after a quick profile that your code was making a ton of calls to dict.\_\_getitem\_\_ So I changed this piece of code: for i in range(0, count): x = x_train[i] y = y_train[i] y_pred = (intercept + (slope * x)) sum0 += (y_pred - y) / count sum1 += ((y_pred - y) * x) / count into this: for x, y in zip(x_train, y_train): y_pred = (intercept + (slope * x)) sum0 += (y_pred - y) / count sum1 += ((y_pred - y) * x) / count Give it a try and let me know if it speeds it up.

Cx-freeze, py2exe, and nuitka, are prob worth a look.
You're using pandas but not taking advantage of vectorisation, check out "apply" and "map" on the dataframes.
Why depend on werkzeug? That really restricts its usefulness to werkzeug based applications, unless people feel comfortable having a wsgi toolkit (or an extra one) bundled with their application. [aiocache](https://github.com/argaen/aiocache/blob/master/README.rst) has a good design of separating backend and serialization that is amazingly useful and easy to work with, implementing a Redis cluster backend was maybe ten lines of code. 
That's a good point. At first, I was only considering exporting the `HelperMixin` which didn't depend on `werkzeug`. But I'm afraid it would be too abstract for people who had never used something like the werkzeug cache classes before. That's why I included the two classes that depend on werkzeug. That said, I am considering making it optional.
Yeah I know about this and I make sure its not...
werkzeug contains much more useful and general purpose things than "just" a WSGI toolkit. I don't necessarily see a problem depending on it.
The `memorize` decorator should probably be called [`memoize`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization). And can I decorate methods as well? If so, is the cache per instance?
I understand. I think you could manage some of that without having to iterate, but I can also appreciate showing the examples of how someone can do it. I was just trying to be helpful. :) 
Hmm. I'm afraid I really don't know, as I'm unable to see your system. Ultimately the problem must come down to there being a naming conflict of some sort. The matplotlib package is on your PYTHONPATH or you wouldn't get that path when you import it directly. The fact that trying to import a module internal to the package causes this problem implies that there is, somehow, another matplotlib package higher on the PYTHONPATH that is no the full package. You could try this, in the same file but before any attempt to import matplotlib. import sys, os from glob import glob for p in sys.path: for g in glob(os.path.join(p, "*matplotlib*")): print(g) If that gives you a list with only one item in it then I'm really not sure.
At least this looks good news to me also. I got THIS.. **C:\Users\SHASWAT\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python36\lib\site-packages\matplotlib** **C:\Users\SHASWAT\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python36\lib\site-packages\matplotlib-2.0.2-py3.6-nspkg.pth** **C:\Users\SHASWAT\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python36\lib\site-packages\matplotlib-2.0.2.dist-info** Does it implies that I have 3 different version of matplotlib package installed??
Yes, but it's predominantly a WSGI toolkit and even billed as such, from the docs: &gt; Werkzeug is a WSGI utility library for Python. If I were writing a CLI or GUI app, I'd be hard pressed to justify the dependency there. 
You wrote a bot that lets Discord users execute arbitrary code *as root* on the server? Are you insane?
well here was the full instructions: 1. Download python 3.5 2. Create a folder on your desktop called PumpBot 3. Copy and paste the downloaded files into the PumpBot folder 4. Open the Terminal/Command Line 5. Paste and enter the following( one by one): cd Desktop/PumpBot pip3 install colorama pip3 install grequests pip3 install requests 6. Enter your api keys into config.txt 7. To run on windows
That's a totally irrational reason. If it contains something useful that has undergone several iterations of maintenance why would you look elsewhere or even implement it yourself?
Check whether your autorun is using the same environment as your regular user profile. Cron has a similar problem because cron has a different set of env vars and paths than a user.
I don't want to hardcode Redis or Memcached in my Python code, I want the type of backend being used inside of a config file. So now I can't say "cache = RedisHelper()", I need to say, "cache = read_config_and_configure_helper()". But wait. My application is a service that doesn't know *where* the config file is at import time, I need to read commandline arguments and such in my main() function to know how I should be reading configuration. So I have no "cache" variable" at import time, and now I don't have "cache" available to decorate my functions, since those are set up at module import time. The solution is to not weld the frontend "cache" variable to the backend, and to use indirection. This is how [dogpile](http://dogpilecache.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html#rudimentary-usage) works. Disclosure: I am the author of dogpile.cache.
Python does not make this easy out of the box, in contrary to other languages and platforms. It's even harder for web apps that you'd like to ship standalone (like with Electron). Hope you'll find something in the links given below !
This might be better for /r/learnpython . I genuinely hate it when people complain and expect people to help them learn what they are missing. That's what you're doing here. For example, you say: &gt; People will say if you mix all kind of data you don't need numpy for speed but I think from a mathematics point of view we should have a generic matrix library we always use without giving it a second though. There's always a question of what the language should provide vs. a library. And the numpy library is built for convenience and speed ... and it is the latter that pushes numpy to have a uniform type (dtype) requirement. Perhaps you aren't aware of sympy's matrix library: http://docs.sympy.org/0.7.2/modules/matrices/matrices.html . If you want something that is more flexible, but much slower, use that. And if that doesn't float your boat ... you can use a different matrix class or create your own. Or you say: &gt; What is a copy and what is a reference again?. In mathematics an assignment of the type y = x would make a new copy of x in y and modifying y would not modify x. This is a purely /r/learnpython question. It's the very basics. Most classes have their own copy member for creating (and then assigning if you want) a copy. e.g. https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.copy.html 
It seems like you're having some growing pains going from Matlab to Python. Specifically it sounds like you are comparing the strengths of Matlab against Python's weaknesses in the domain of your specific use case. A lot of your gripes, such as lack of pretty printing matrices, are justified by the fact that Python is a **general purpose** language, and significantly more so than Matlab. Example: Which one would you use to write the backend of Reddit? It's not constructive to just go and say "why doesn't thing B do my task exactly the way thing A does?" When things A and B have different domains. If you want Python to have native matrix support why not use Matlab instead? Use the right tool for the job. Anyway, I searched and found this: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44767566/numeric-computation-of-certain-symbols-in-numpy-array-of-sympy-expressions It looks like sympy has its own matrices.
yep you called it, now it just won't open :(
I don't think it's irrational to not want to have a wsgi dependency in a non webapp. There's not much non-wsgi stuff werkzeug provides that couldn't be found someplace else or easily implemented yourself. 
Is it [this](https://chrisalbon.com/machine-learning/random_forest_classifier_example_scikit.html)? BTW- the library is called scikit-learn, not scilearnkit (abbreviated sklearn).
Damn it :) I had this page open and made (literally, letter for letter) the exact same change before refreshing and seeing your reply. Mine went from 4.145s to 0.224s. Sometimes python's inability to optimise even the most obvious local variable assignments or loop invariants drives me crazy. Especially when more strongly typed languages have made these optimisations for years. I know the reasons but it still annoys me. For the OP: If you're finding a program that runs badly but should run fairly well, you can sometimes try PyPy (a python Just-In-Time compiler). When it works for your program, it can offer enormous speedups. Sometimes it can be worth doing part of your analysis in python 3 (with the libraries it provides) and the processing hungry stuff in pypy. 
SKLearn Support Vector Machine maybe? I use this for text classification, I'm sure it'll work on the iris dataset as well. http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.SGDClassifier.html
Here's my favorite article about vectorizing for-loops: [From Python to Numpy](https://www.labri.fr/perso/nrougier/from-python-to-numpy/). It totally changed the way I write loops in general, not just numpy.
Nice, thanks! What I ended up doing: use np.fromfile and working in the 1D coordinates, knowing the shape of the images, and having finally remembered the data types contained. Thanks again for your insight. 
Thanks for the gist super helpful
this link might be more helpful: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/svm/plot_iris.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-svm-plot-iris-py
Nowhere near qualified, but this was super fun to read.
Thats the course im taking but the exercises are using MATLAB. Is it worth learning how to use MATLAB or should I just continue doing the exercises in python? 
You are just confirming theres no standard I can trust and I may need to switch between different matrix types depending of the application. Something as basic as a matrix should be standarized. Im aware of sympy matrices, so should I create sympy matrix and then jump back to numpy and perhaps later transform to built in list because this other module I just found uses that instead? Talk about optimization now. What about nee data types? Should all implement their own matrix lybrary too? Perhaps matrices should be built in then if no standard generic module exists. Im aware of copies and references. Im just questioning the decission taken in numpy is not consistent with mathematics. Matlab has handle and value classes just for that: https://se.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_oop/comparing-handle-and-value-classes.html. Every math type should be a value and should be optimized (passed by reference until modified) in my opinion. Anyway its still confusing reading the docs there are numpy functions that may do a copy or reference depending if they can or not. Im just ranting because compared with the rest of Python I think the data manipulation capabilities is far behind because the basics are not there. 
&gt; Why do you have so many version combinations? I generally create a new environment for every new research project I have, which means they quickly become quite many. Since I want to be able to rerun experiments later, using the exact same library versions I can't keep updating them to a shared (newest) version of these libraries.
In case you haven't looked at the docs: * Context Locals * URL Helpers * Utilities * Data Structures * HTTP Utilities * Filesystem Utilities Now I'm not saying that it's necessarily a good thing to have all of this crammed in one library but it's still there and useful. And there's not much harm done when there's stuff you do not use, is there?
Does Medium pay publishers? The reason I ask is the proliferation of junk posts like this. What could possibly be the motivation for writing this? It has zero value to the python and/or learning community!
I'm unconvinced. Cachelper has an unnecessary dependency on werkzeug, it's not adding anything of value. There's not a killer feature that can only be found in werkzeug, or even something that could be done via a copypaste plus attribution. If you feel the need to add unnecessary dependencies to your apps, that's fine. I don't like installing half of a package repo to run something (consequently, this is why I don't care much for javascript development). 
No, that appears to be one installation, though you could check what is in the .pth file. I'm sorry I'm at a bit of a loss; you're on Windows, which I don't use, so there's additional issues. You say you're double clicking the file, could you also add this to the top of the file: import sys print(sys.executable) I just want to ensure you're not somehow picking up a different Python than we expect.
There is also a bug in your code. The read_csv function assumes the first row contains the column names. This means that you end up ignoring the first row in your data analysis. To see the partial contents of your dataframe use: print(d.head()) 61.530358025636438 62.562382297945803 0 53.426804 68.777596 1 61.530358 62.562382 2 47.475640 71.546632 3 59.813208 87.230925 4 55.142188 78.211518 Starting gradient descent linear regression with theta0: 0 theta1: 0 Working...

You're taking the Machine Learning Course (which uses Matlab). I said deep learning (which uses Python)
Matlab is a better calculator. It is completely useless for anything aside from vector math, because it is uniquely tailored to that purpose. Python is a general purpose programming language that has some libraries that can be used for vector math. Matlab is awesome for what it does. I've created some wonderful plots in matlab and there are many aspects to the language obviously intended to facilitate that and similar tasks. Then I tried to automate some of the plots. Right away all the global state started blowing up in my face and oh how I wished for a real programming language then… Right now you're caught up in the normal transition dilemma anyone faces when trying a new language over one they're used to. You see all the details you're not familiar with that *may* be inferior in some way while you've not yet gotten to appreciate other things that may be better. A result is, for example, your specific complaint that functions cannot be applied to numpy's arrays. Of course they can't, no sane programming language does that. Implicit polymorphism like that serves no purpose other than saving a few characters. It's purely a convenience for people who are used to it. At the same time it adds complexity, it adds potential error sources, it requires additional documentation… The fact that Matlab can get away with it is because nobody in their right mind uses Matlab for anything but vector math. Python by comparison can be used for just about anything. 
Also, this sheet will tell you how to do Matlab operations in numpy http://mathesaurus.sourceforge.net/matlab-numpy.html As for whether it is "worth it" to do Matlab - that depends on your goals. Plenty of academics still use Matlab, as well as certain types of engineers, but very few industry data scientist use it. 
Regarding your complains about numpy/sympy: These are two packages, each having is distinct types and usecases. numpy does numerical computations, sympy does symbolic computations. If you want to perform symbolic math, use sympy. If you later want to generate code accoring to the symbolic calculations use [Sympy Lambdify](http://docs.sympy.org/latest/modules/utilities/lambdify.html). I think numpy and python has a very clean and predictable concept on when copies or references are used. They might not line up with mathematics as nicely as wanted, but I think everyone working with python has no problem about this because the rules apply throughout the language. If you want, we I can start a rant about matlab. For example the instable API's of the toolboxes (they change the call signature between each version), the almost (but not exactly) equal functions located in different toolboxes, the magic way to mix in symbolic math, ...
Oh this is evil... Wonderful
Ok, so that's not what I'm asking for. Whenever you have an error, you need to go to the actual code causing the error. So what does that line of code say?
Does someone have the appropriate code to take the sin of Sympy Matrix per the OP's example? I tried with sp.sin on the sp.Matrix version of his array, but got this: AttributeError: ImmutableMatrix has no attribute could_extract_minus_sign. Apparently you can't do normal vectorized operations on them in general.
Still angry about losing the election?
Lol. Yeah, because it has nothing to do with us having a literal moron at the helm. If literally anyone else had won I wouldnt care. But America has the least qualified, most ridiculous leader right now. And I just want oompa lumpa to stop tweeting at 4am threats to N. Korea and other bullcrap. *Any* POTUS should be held to that standard.
I've checked already. There doesn't seem to be a problem with that.
For testing purposes on a controlled environment? Yes. But anyways, the code isn't executed as root, of course. It's sandboxed by UMLBox, so don't worry about it.
Sadly abusing subreddits for political activism became a normal thing after the election. Why can't we simply talk about Python programming here?
There is no popular and free solution where you only need to press a button. To use any of the multiple choices mentioned you need to understand your script modular structure, edit the config and debug some edge cases of you're using scipy or tcl/tk. Better way to distribute your script could be setting up the package correctly (your mileage may vary). That is by far the biggest problem imo why python didn't conquer the world yet. Gil and optimization is far behind.
&gt; You are just confirming theres no standard I can trust ... Standard? I can confirm that there is no matrix type as part of the language. I can confirm that there are many different matrix modules/libraries that one can use and that they will be different depending on their goals. I can confirm that you can create your own if you don't like what is available. &gt; Something as basic as a matrix should be standarized. Should be? This is your matlab bias coming through. The "mat" in matlab is specifically for "matrix". Look at the many thousands of languages out there and ask which of these has a matrix as a language defined type. You will see that your view appears to be the minority view. If you think a language without an inherent matrix type isn't useful for what you want ... then don't use it. &gt; Every math type should be a value and should be optimized (passed by reference until modified) in my opinion. Again, that would be your *opinion* ... one that it biased because you are familiar with Matlab. Don't give the bullshit "is not consistent with mathematics". Speaking as a PhD mathematician: mathematics doesn't have a semantic data model ... programming languages do. Personally, I just figured out python's data model and am rarely surprised. It's pretty simple and consistent. Basically, all of your complaints boil down to: It doesn't work like matlab does. 
I'd rather use dogpile cache. It seems more universal.
if he annoys you, can't you just block his tweets? (I don't twitter, so I don't know)
pip install -e
It's a python program being used to influence politics - at a point in time in which a majority of the country is horrified by actions of the most powerful person in the world. Seems reasonable to me.
Was his script not written in python? &gt; Why can't we simply talk about Python programming here? If this really bothers you, propose a rule change.
If M is a sympy matrix: M.applyfunc(sp.sin). And there are many other ways .... (consider sympy.utilities and see some things about iterations, flatten, etc.). 
This is a piece of shit EDIT: your script and your approach to democracy. 
It's a single main.py containing constants and a main function with a while loop and some conditionals. It's not even generic enough to talk to other Twitter accounts without rewriting its code. Where will this subreddit end when everybody being able to write 50 lines of Python starts to post programs like that?
You have hundreds of other subreddits catering to over the top trump bashing. Can you please leave programming subreddits out of this.
I'm currently in a challenge at: http://www.practicepython.org/exercise/2014/04/02/09-guessing-game-one.html That i'm publishing on my personal site :) https://automationutopia.wordpress.com/category/python-exercises/
 print("Fuck Trump!") This is a python script too. Maybe I should put it on github and share a link to my repository here?
The _( strings are i18n, for internationalising your code (providing language translations for strings). https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/gettext.html#internationalizing-your-programs-and-modules This question would be more appropriate for /r/learnpython. You'll need to specify exactly what part of design you don't get.
It is not most powerful person in the world! Whole America is not most powerful country in the world at the moment. 
Nice strawman you have there. Like I said in my previous post, if this really irks you, consider proposing a "no politics" rule.
Strawman? You guys are nuts. Please consider creating a /r/political_programming subreddit.
Am I the only one who is on that not-beginner-but-not advanced-either level? Like beginner tutorials are too easy to follow but things like deep learning is too hard.
Hey folks... shhh, try and keep this quite. But the worst thing that could happen for our goals would be that he goes quite. We want his insanity to be unfiltered and on public display. We can use it as reasons for invoking the 25th or for impeachment. Shhh... don't let it get around.
This is obviously correct but also amusing is that he's including the time for how long he stares at his plot. if he moves end = time.time() above graphResult(....) he probably would notice it only took 1.7 seconds. Of course using a proper looping idiom makes it 10 times faster but it seems like he didn't even bother to look at what was going on himself.
Were you going to refute anything I said or are we done here?
Are you even real or are you satire?
Well, not many languages claim to be a general purpose language :) Julia has them for instance. I think matrices are a key feature for computation in most engineering fields and the lack of a matrix standard makes everything harder than it should with every other module making their own. Then things dont work together. I agree with you about the last point but I think using copies is the "right way" when dealing with numbers. Lets say after some operations I have a vector which I slice. Then I modify one element of the slice (for example to transform units) and do some other calculations and my original vector got modified too. I think in general it makes more sense to make copies. Now if Im working with classes and I pass objects around I expect them to be references as it makes more sense in this context as you actually tend to want to modify the reference. 
Officially he can't delete his twitter, as he now uses it in his capacity as POTUS. Too little too late.
If you read the docs it clearly says they do different things. https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/os.html
When I ran that I got: Users-MacBook-Pro-4:~ User$ python SimGame.py File "SimGame.py", line 1 SyntaxError: Non-UTF-8 code starting with '\x90' in file SimGame.py on line 1, but no encoding declared; see http://python.org/dev/peps/pep-0263/ for details What did you download?
Use **os.listdir** (or **os.scandir** in &gt;= 3.5) to list items in a single directory, use **os.walk** (which uses **os.listdir** or **os.scandir** in &gt;= 3.5) to list items in a directory tree. Using **os.walk** for just a single directory is not as efficient as just using the function it uses internally to do that job.
sure you are right, i just gave a rare example
Without looking at the code too closely, this looks like a case where tossing some of that code into a function and decorating it with `@numba.jit` will lead to speeds comparable to C.
Thank you! I made this function in order to skip having to put decorators on every function I use this code after declaring my functions def func(): pass d = globals().copy() for (item, val) in d.items(): if type(d[item]) == type(func): globals()[item] = CheckInputTypes(d[item]) 
Cut out the `+=`, build lists and let the built-in sum do the calculation after the `for loop` perhaps better? `timeit` to the rescue?
&gt; numba.jit Huh. Nice one. Never encountered numba before. What is the workflow like? Can I just pip it and add the annotation and expect it to work?
Always reach for this first [Python Performance Tips](https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonSpeed/PerformanceTips). After 17 years using Python I've never once guessed performance correctly, and I'm not unique in that.
First, you need to re-read all of that, and then re-think all of it, and explain it again in a **MUCH** clearer fashion, possibly with many more examples, because I'm a native English speaker and quite an advanced programmer, and for the life of me I simply cannot tell what the heck you're asking for. Like nothing you've said makes any sense in whole or in part in terms of a question that I could answer. Second, this should be in [r/learnpython](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython).
"registering a.py" isn't a thing in Python. What *exactly* did you do? You can only be helped by giving people the tools necessary to understand your problem.
I didn't realize that! Thanks for the explanation I thought they were essentially the same thing.
It's not a little ironic that the profiling section of that page is relegated to the end.

ok sorry for that, I'll give you an example of that "game" so it starts. FIRST "HAND":I receive 5 random FIRST "HAND"_CARDS_ON_TABLE: 1a , 1b, 1c, 2b, 3a; I chose to make a 1a,1b,1c pair that is 20 points and my three cards get removed now on table are just 2b, 3a. SECOND "HAND": I receive 3 more random cards because of the 3 I chosed to make the PAIR (it needs to be 5 on the table) SECOND_"HAND"_CARDS_ON_TABLE: 2b, 3a, 8a, 8b, 5a I chose to not make any pare(I can't anyway) and I CHOSE to DISCARD 2b. THIRD "HAND": I receive 1 card cause I discarded 1 THIRD_"HAND"_CARDS_ON_TABLE: 3a, 8a, 8b, 5a, 5b and the game continues until all my 24 cards are gone (1a,1b,1c,2a,2b,2c,3a,......7c,8a,8b,8c ) SO you can chose either you make a pair that you can form (FIRST_"HAND" example where I got 20 points for 1a,1b,1c pair ) or you discard one of your 5 cards on the table and you keep receiving random cards so you always have 5 cards on the table. Hope I helped you with that... I'm not great at explaining
That's better. Thank you.
Yet another worthless thread from another moron who knows squat about Python, please move on people, there's nothing worth reading here.
Let me put it this way: installing numba with `conda` and writing numba-valid Python has been much easier for my specific applications (scientific code) than writing Cython or a C extension. I have never installed numba with `pip` since I typically use `conda` environments. numba has several compiled dependencies, like llvm, so it may or may not be hard to install from source with `pip`. Installation with `conda` is trivial. Numba supports only a subset of [Python language features](http://numba.pydata.org/numba-doc/dev/reference/pysupported.html) and [NumPy features](http://numba.pydata.org/numba-doc/dev/reference/numpysupported.html). For example, you can pass lists of numbers into a jitted function, but dictionaries are not supported (in the most aggressive compilation mode).
Use `scipy.optimize`: https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/optimize.html
I suggest that you copy and paste `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'winshell'` into a search engine and see what you find. I'm actually staggered that there are only 11 replies on google, now that is rather rare.
You can apply sp.sin() to the element of the array that is a symbol (it will work in other numbers too also). Otherwise I would imagine there should be a way using Sympy matrices instead. You can't just use np.sin() as np.sin() doesn't compute Sympy symbols. My point is that it would make more sense in my opinion for np.sin() to try to access sin() in the Sympy module (if exists) for the symbol and otherwise return to its own implementation (which in this case would fail).
Thanks for the info. &gt; Installation with `conda` is trivial. &lt;eyes narrow&gt; I'm not sure if this is the next step down a rabbit hole since I've not used conda before either :) Oh well, tally-ho! edit: I was right... On the conda "getting started guide" &gt; Verify that Anaconda or Miniconda is installed
... Ok, I'm a bit surprised by this, but I'm actually less clear than I was before. So you've got three *suits* of cards, A, B, and C, and each *suit* contains 8 face value cards? Yeah? Now, first round you get 5 cards. In each round you can choose to count any one pair -- which normally means two cards of the same face value, but you seem to mean three cards with the same face value of any suit -- towards your score, removing these cards from your hand, or you can choose to discard any number of cards? Or only one card? So your "pair" of 3 cards can move on to the next hand? Why would you do that? There doesn't seem to be a way to improve any given pair's score. At the start of every round your hand is replenished to five cards. Which means you either receive 3 cards because you got a pair, or 1-5 cards if you chose not to count your pair and discarded some number of cards. There being 24 cards, this means that you could end up with a final hand with only 4 cards. What does this mean? In fact it looks like there's lots of ways you could end up with smaller than 5 card hands. Is the game over the moment this happens, or are pairs of 3 scored in that final round? Lastly, how does each "pair" relate to the scores you listed? From the look of it you're actually talking about *three-of-a-kinds*!having one set of scores, *straights* having another, and *straight flushes* having a third. I'm trying to understand, but the rules of this game make about as much sense as the psychology of toast.
Professional programmers do not `hack`. Amateur programmers should not `hack`. No professional in any occupation should `hack`. Yes Python is an excellent language to start with. Here's why [Christian Tismer quote - Python is the second best programming language in the world. But the best has yet to be invented :-](https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-list/2002-November/141486.html).
thanks. I migrated my question.
I mean ... conda is a packaqe manager for anaconda python. Either you have it or not. if not you will need to pip install numba. Anyway, yes, you can just decorate it with @jit but this isn't the kind of code that jit is going to help him with.
you almost got the idea, so you get 5 cards then you can make straights/3 of a kind/and straight flushes if you do so the cards that you made this formations are removed and replenished with other random cards that remains from the 24 that you start the game, if you can't make any of this 3 formations or maybe you don't want you can discard 1-5 cards that also will be replenished with new random cards from the remaining cards. If you remain with less than 5 cards or even with 5 cards in the end and you can't make any pair you can finish the game and keep your points that you made. And what I want is to make a script or something that tells me what should I do to have best chances of getting a higher score
I use `cachetools`, it's a pretty good implementation that let's you incorporate lots of different backends.
Dude, wtf? 
Why do you make the assumption that everybody is on the trump bashing train. I know it's fashionable to bash trump in an attempt to be politically correct but really?
Thanks -- just submitted it.
Thanks for your critique. I'll ignore it completely. ;-)
So I presume you've had a look at [livestreamer](http://docs.livestreamer.io/plugin_matrix.html)?
Not generic enough? Literally all anyone would have to do is change the one constant MESSAGE. This is exactly the way constants should be used. Of course, I could have asked for an 'input('Who do you want to annoy?')' or put the target person in a config file but creating a new file just to change the recipient of an 'annoyTrump' script seems as stupid as ... Well... The 45th POTUS. But feel free to create a branch and merge request.
job availability mainly depends on where you are but for next steps, id recommend finding a course or book on data structures and algorithms, if you want a job in software it important for you to know things about that. the other important things are to keep practicing, think up a project , plan it and get going on it, if you get stuck google, stack overflow and reddit are great resources for looking for help. I found a good combo of learning data structures/ algos and learning a language at the same time is to implement data structures/ algos in the language (in this case python) as you get experience in both problem solving and it really cements the theory of the data structures or algos. 
Send me the links no too, I'll take a look. 
Not correct. He is not obligated to use Twitter as an official forum. While it *is* currently being disputed if he can legally block US citizens from viewing hia tweets, however, he has other methods at his disposal to address people. Also, saying he "can't" delete his twitter has implications that Twitter could not delete or ban the President's personal Twitter account (In contrast to @POTUS) for violation of their terms, which arguably he has already violated. 
Yeah, let me congratulate you on your beautiful script. It was definitely worth sharing that masterpiece with /r/python. Look at all those upvotes and all the positive feedback in the comments.
Thanks for the input!
No problem, if you're looking for a book i'd recommend Introduction to Algorithms 3rd Edition by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest and Stein EDIT: I know the book can be expensive, when i needed it i got linked to a pdf version which was under some free release (i can't remember where it was now)
Well then I missed something somewhere. Ol' Spicey said 45's twitter is official, nobody has said to the contrary since. That said, the 9th Circuit court says his [tweets do need to be taken seriously](http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2017/06/12/17-15589.pdf) as the president’s Twitter feed is a legally binding stream of consciousness (footnote 14). Anyway, I have no desire to debate/argue about Trump's *anything*, so let's get back to Python!
Thanks. I've fixed the typo. This decorator currently only works for functions. I'm working on adding support for decorating methods. 
Wow, thanks for your works on `dogpile.cache`. You can think of the `RedisCache` class as an example of using the `HelperMixin`. So the users don't have to hardcode the backend. They can just use the mixin. `dogpile.cache` is very useful, but for some of my small projects, it feels like an overkill.
I am using spyder and the plot is shown in console so it does not need to be closed for the timer to finish. It does take a little bit of time to be initialized though.
That is a seriously awesome package
http://www.realtechsupport.org/UB/SR/algorithms/Cormen_Algorithms_3rd.pdf Was this it?
thats the one
Thanks got it in my iBooks now, going to find a hard copy also, nothing like a hard copy. Thanks again!
i know what you mean about hard copies, but they are fairly expensive, always keeping my eye out for them though
Alright let me rephrase - and this isn't personal. The problem isn't python. The problem is that this is terrible code - from a python perspective. I see the semicolons and your naming conventions and know you are starting out and coming from some other language like c++ and so I understand why you are using an indexed loop. In fact, I would bet you found it incredibly annoying to have to loop to over the range of something that acts like an index instead of iterate your index. I might even bet that if it wasn't required to have an iterable in the syntax, you'd have created an index inside your loop and incremented it yourself. When you feel that way in python, as cliche as this sounds, it's very often it's b/c you're writing the wrong kind of code. In this case it's b/c the syntax is meant to select the items, one by one, out of a collection of objects. It probably should have been called, 'for each'. What's happening in your code is that Python is terrible at iterating an array index because it's literally starting at index 0 and counting it's way up each time. Think of python lists as linked lists rather than arrays. The language provides better mechanisms like zip and for x in iterable. Using something like numpy, you actually might want to iterate the index but numpy isn't python behind the scenes. Using pythonic loops is definitely one of the biggest things new users don't see in the literature, or forget. I'm not sure exactly what it is b/c the information is out there but no one internalizes it when they are starting out. In fact, most comments in this thread didn't notice it at all. So my solution is to recommend a youtube lecture by raymond hettinger called [Beyond Pep8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf-BqAjZb8M) that tries to go over certain kinds of idiomatic practices and makes the case that they are better to use.

I am learning tkinter first then i will work on a text editor app on python.
Hm, that is an interesting approach, but seems extremely hacky/less Pythonic. But its good you are experimenting with how this could look :)
The size indicated in wireshark is the size of the data (0) + the ethernet, IP and UDP protocol headers, so you can deduce the "true" on-the-wire size from that

I'm pretty sure in every version where scandir is more efficient, listdir and walk use it internally. 
Download and unpack WinPython Zero into a directory. Set path to this and install all requirements and your own package. Create a wrapper that calls the env script and then launch your own program. Rezip.
You want to look at Julia. 
Thanks for your input.

Kind of a fun problem. Here's how I did it: from math import cosh, sinh from scipy.optimize import minimize_scalar def dist(x0, y0, x1, y1): # 2d Cartesian distance return ((x1 - x0) ** 2 + (y1 - y0) ** 2) ** 0.5 def solve_catenary(x0, y0, x1, y1, length): """ Given a catenary curve hanging between (x0, y0) and (x1, y1) with specified length, Return the curve parameters xm, ym, a such that (xm, ym) is the lowest point of the curve (not necessarily in the solution interval) and `a` is the scaling parameter. The curve equation is then y(x) = ym + a * (cosh((x - xm) / a) - 1.) Note: the `cosh() - 1.` means that whole subclause cancels out at x == xm, so the curve intersects (xm, ym) """ # Solution method based on # https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catenary#Determining_parameters # ensure a solution is possible if length &lt; dist(x0, y0, x1, y1): raise ValueError("length is too short, no solution is possible") # ensure that x0 is to the left of x1 if x0 &gt; x1: x0, y0, x1, y1 = x1, y1, x0, y0 # find vertical and horizontal reach v = y1 - y0 h = x1 - x0 # note: h &gt;= 0 # solve to find `a` lhs = (length ** 2 - v ** 2) ** 0.5 # rhs = 2 * a * sinh(h / (2 * a)) # This is a transcendental function; # we must solve numerically to find `a` such that lhs == rhs def err1(a): two_a = 2 * a rhs = two_a * sinh(h / two_a) return abs(rhs - lhs) # use bounded solver to force `a` &gt;= 0 a = minimize_scalar(err1, method="Bounded", bounds=(1e-5, 1e+5)).x # Now that we have a solution for `a`, we can # substitute back to find values for xm, ym: # ym = y0 - a * (cosh((x0 - xm) / a) - 1.) # = y1 - a * (cosh((x1 - xm) / a) - 1.) def err2(xm): lhs = y0 - a * (cosh((x0 - xm) / a) - 1.) rhs = y1 - a * (cosh((x1 - xm) / a) - 1.) return abs(rhs - lhs) xm = minimize_scalar(err2).x ym = y0 - a * (cosh((x0 - xm) / a) - 1.) return xm, ym, a Do check the results; they look plausible, but I have not absolutely 100% verified the correctness! Note that I am essentially using `minimize_scalar` as a root-finder; my error functions return `abs(rhs - lhs)` which has minimum value 0. at `rhs == lhs`. This then runs like &gt;&gt;&gt; solve_catenary(0, 0, 1, 0, 50) # Your example above - anchor points 1 unit apart, length 50 (0.50000000002823519, -24.921178021413105, 0.077247542589067394) ... which says that the lowest point is at (0.5, -24.92) - x is correct, and y looks very plausible - and the curvature constant is 0.07724. Runtime averages a hair over 1 ms.
Thank you for the answer! I needed the size to be shown on the standatd output, but only the bytes of the message after all, so 0 was OK. It was for a college assignment work. Thx
GraphQL really has the potential to be the next REST, and if more companies sign on, more OSS community support, I think we're looking at a really good time in web development for the next several years.
Because you're reading Learn Python the Hard Way for Python 2. There's another version called "Learn Python 3 the Hard Way"(https://learnpythonthehardway.org/python3/) where it would be the other way around.
Zsh...
See shreddit
Just install Anaconda and it should give you what you need, it's a pretty nice scientific distribution of Python
You might look into university it departments. They are lower paying than a lot of industry positions but are more open to self taught programmers because of it. 
The people who run these sorts of scripts are generally worried about the fact that "delete", on reddit, is a visibility modifier, not a deletion. So the comment text is still there, just no longer publicly visible. This is why they use scripts to overwrite, since that replaces the text in reddit's database.
&gt; comment.edit(".") 
I'm not familiar with zsh... care to elaborate?
There are a lot of comments about hacking on this post that I just don't agree with. People are reading the word hacker and just equating it with something bad, but there is such a thing as an ethical hacker. In fact there is even a certification for ethical hackers called CEH(Certified Ethical Hacker). If you would like to learn how to become an ethical hacker do some research on CEH and you will find tons of courses. To answer your post yes python is great for noobs and for hackers.

Well as that minimises the attack surface it certainly does help. If you control the side doing the deserializing and have written your own Unpickler then you are much safer - and you're more likely to catch malicious behaviour too. Maybe using pickle in this respect could act as a honeypot. I stand by the advice that python objects (any code implementation) shouldn't be serialised for sharing data between parties. Especially not crypto primitives!
Make it so you can search the API. Have different versions (blueprints). Work with flask restful /restless. Setup authentication and authorization
But why? It's obnoxius as hell, and it results in an instant downvote from me, whenever I happen to look at a post history with 30k+ karma and 4 visible comments.
It seems super cool, but it seems like it could be a lot of duplicated code and even worse, a performance hog if you're not super careful in using it. It's got a somewhat nicer interface than REST but it's not the gamechanger I was hoping it would be.
It's not just a nicer interface. Letting the requester specify what data it needs is a massive game changer for component-based front end architecture. You have an `ingredient-list` component that knows how to make and populate its own data. That component is now more modular, lowers the payload size, but more importantly, it rethinks the contract between front end and back end. every project i've worked on before has massive, spaghetti'd, undocumented, inconsistent rest endpoints with weird arguments, different data structures, and unexpected outcomes. That's basically impossible with GraphQL, cause you only get exactly what you ask for. As long as what you're asking for is made available in the contract. Backend developers can iterate more quickly over GraphQL schemas than REST endpoints. (I know, cause I've done both, and my god it's a breath of fresh air.) GraphQL comes with a spec! REST did, too, technically, but not a very clear one, and not one that anyone ever used. "How would you define REST" is a major interview question for a reason; there are 1000 ways to do it and none of them are right and they all reveal something about the developer's personality. With GraphQL, there's just schema. No opinions, no inconsistency. Idk, I know I sound like a fanboy but working in it makes my dev life much better.
Can strongly recommend Sentdex on Youtube or his website, pythonprogramming.net. Really good machine learning tutorials from stocks to images to whatever you can imagine. He even built a bot that plays GTA5... We'll drives/crashes around. Still awesome though.
&gt; GraphQL query is a string that is sent to a server to be interpreted and fulfilled, which then returns JSON back to the client. That's an amazingly poor description of what GraphQL is. You just described part of the protocol, which isn't terribly interesting, and more importantly doesn't distinguish GraphQL from REST or even just GET requests.
You need to put this code on a Pi with a big red button and sell it as a fail safe over at /r/gonewild
This is great, it is way more elegant they my solution. Would you have an idea on how to minimise the difference between wanted length and the calculated length between p0 and p1? I've upload some points [here](https://pastebin.com/VfCDVxan) the data contains x0, y0, x1, y1, length, calculated length, difference, percent difference. 
this is a good way to get banned. i did it a while back and it triggered spam warning. on top of a 3-day site-wide ban, im still banned from r/django, r/history, r/technology, r/news, r/worldnews, and a few more
The only reason is readability. When you read the signature of my version, you have an immediate understanding of what's the intended expected argument. In my view `**kwargs` goes against the python zen because it allows very implicit (and unspecific) functions declarations. I understand it's a useful mechanism in some cases, but this doesn't look like one (to me).
Thanks! I will be keeping this in mind!
How can you be sure they overwrite it? Maybe they add it to some "context history" and show you only the newest one.
A dead account from my past with a badly chosen username easily identifiable that took me 18 months of comments to realize I should make a new account. That'd be why for me.

Dude. He only had 5 MINUTES!
And he wasted one with that garbage intro!
Hi, well I tried to keep it really simple, I did not want to explain further than that. The aim of the post was actually for people who already knew what graphql was, and not to compare rest vs graphql. I might update the post or create a new one more detailed though. Really appreciated your feedback, thanks! :)
I honestly hate the "Technology X in only 15 minutes" or whatever. I can skim documentation for that level of depth. If I'm reading third party info, I want someone with experience to share their experience of actually using the tech with me. Talk about pit falls, best practices, things to watch out for, the best way to architect my projects etc. Things that I can get from just reading the docs. Like, I'm really good with Flask, ROR, and React (getting there with express :P). If I'm teaching someone about those technologies, I'm going to bring my depth of knowledge, not just skim through the documentation.
You wrote software to bully, harass other people on the internet? Please can you take a little time and think about your behaviour?!
On a Mac, you wanna use iterm2 and zsh

Zsh doesn’t do this on ls, except when you enter local git repo with cd, then it’ll show you current branch.
You are welcome. :)
Google, and indeed most search engines, specifically limit scraping like this, so might run into trying to teach your script how to defeat Captcha checks that specifically exist to stop scripts from being able to defeat them. Google does have a free tier for their [Custom Search API](https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/python/apis/customsearch/v1) but you need to fall below the limits or start paying. Also this should be in [r/learnpython](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython).
I am here because I am interested in the use of the python programming language. I am not interested in US politics.
Could it be bypassed with a delay? If anyone knows how frequent it needs to be before it triggers the warning
A Dryscrape session can be indistinguishable from a normal user's browser visit.
Best thing to do would be random generate seconds to sleep() between iterations... That way there's no pattern. Frequently used when scraping.
Neat! Thanks :-)
No, that doesn't make it closed source.

I mean that's technically what all "deletes" are on your pc, your phone, or web. It just unlinks the data table and marks it as space to be overwritten in the future. 
Hmm... what mode did you select for your app? Was it "script" credentials tied to your account, or something you specified as being able to be used by others or something? I seem to remember there being several different settings you can have for creating credentials for scripting. I've done the same thing to another account and recently and haven't got any alerts on anything like that. https://ssl.reddit.com/prefs/apps I believe I selected "script for personal use" which might have made it more lenient. I imagine any of those others "web app" or "installed app" might have different monitoring or throttling or something. Well, I didn't edit it to a ".", so it wasn't necessarily making changes, just deleting. Personally I think the whole thing about editting it to make it truly delete the comment bullshit. There's no reason they can't just save old comments before edits. If I wanted to save comment history, edits wouldn't overwrite the actual history. I could just as easily save the history of every single API request that creates/edits/deletes comments and then just query for all API requests that hit comment ID abcd1345 and see a log of everything that went on with it. The only comment that doesn't go and stay in a DB is the one you didn't type.
Sure, but with a database-backed application people often expect an actual delete of the relevant row(s), and seem to be surprised when they find out it isn't.
The admins making manual changes that aren't open source changes -- makes reddit a non open source platform. Reddit can be based on the code, but things that go on with reddit now a days can be fabricated by the admins - Hell they've admitted to it.
Try out the argparse library, it is what I ended up using for my script recently and there is a good tutorial in the python documentation
I use selenium/python. However like another user posted, you'll struggle to scrape google results. For a similar project I did I had to use bing (oh the humanity!)
They could just as easily have it as some closed source middleware they don't make public, something that proxies every HTTP request and caches all creates/updates/deletes of comments and the user that submitted it. There's no reason at all they can't save every single edit and what you had in your comment before. If that data is useful, then they probably will.
Please use r/learnpython. Formatting gets really messed up on mobile. I also wrote this on mobile, and that whole messed up formatting thing goes both ways. `from sys import argv` import the "argv" *variable* from sys. Argv contains the arguments that the script was called with, for example, typing `script.py spam foo` in the console to run a script would set argv to `['path/to/script/script.py', 'spam', 'foo']`. Here it's supposed to be called with one argument as you can see in the next line (the first item of argv is always the path to the calling script). `script, filename = argv` unpacks the two items of argv, setting the first to `script` and the second to `filename`. Since `script` isn't used at all, it would be better to do `filename = argv[1]`. `txt = open(filename)` opens the file name provided, but it's a bad idea for a number a reasons. First of all, you should use `with` to open files, or you risk corrupting them if the script exits while they're still open. Second `open(filename)` is a file *object*, not the contents of the file, so it's not text as the variable name would suggest, and should instead be referred to as something that would indicate that's it's a file object. I would recommend using python 3; no reason to use a legacy version unless it's required. Other than that, I would also suggest using the format function or f-strings instead of a modulo. Also the `print` here would print "Here is your file yourfilename:", with the colon after the filename. For the `raw_input`, it should be combined with the previous print. "\n" will add a newline. e.g `file_again = raw_input('Type the filename again:\n&gt; ')` Neither of the opened files were ever closed, which is a pretty bad idea. And again, please *always* use `with` when opening files. A better version would be (in python 3, print and input are the only things that change): import sys filename = sys.argv[1] print(f'Here is you file: {filename}') with open(filename, 'r') as f: print(f.read()) filename = input('Type the filename again:\n&gt; ') with open(filename, 'r') as f: print(f.read())
but it prints only for single page, how to get content of multiple pages? and how to import them to csv?
Spez said he did once, stop pretend the admins have a secret agenda they're trying to push. Also, we're talking about the code. Which is open source. Feel free to impose whatever self righteous morals you want on not being completely transparent, but we're talking about the code. Go back to t_d.
was it something that deleted your comments, or just edited them to say "THIS COMMENT HAS BEEN DELETED, CLICK THIS URL TO SEE THE SCRIPT THAT WAS USED" which every moderator hates? - - - edit: [I can not understand why you received bans *at all*](https://i.imgur.com/uGfV6sK.png), maybe something to do with not deleting your comments at all and just filling them with paragraphs of bullshit people then have to scroll through?
the database isn't open, because it contains a) every comment deleted or not, b) every private comment ever sent, c) its not code what spez said he did was a direct-to-database edit, which makes sense because why do it any other way the first time - - - or rather, [here](https://www.postgresql.org/ftp/source/) is the sourcecode to the tools used to edit comments
&gt; I honestly hate the "Technology X in only 15 minutes" or whatever. I'm a huge fan of them. All I really need is the basic outline. If I need details, that's what the docs are for. But first, convince me I even want to try this and get me started with something simple I can do myself.
Thank you
How similar was your goal? Also, thanks
what if we dont have any idea how many pages are there?? suppose like 2000 or more than that?
Just a simple task my fiancé needed doing for work which was to google search 800 people/companies/brands that attended 2016 San Diego Comic Con. She had googled 10 manually before I suggested python could help. So I just wrote a small script which would navigate to bing, searches the company/person name, then return the text from the first link description. It worked for about 90% of them :) My reason for using selenium was just because I had a tutorial in it at work, and have used it for all webscraping/online form filling out projects since
I think I've got my answer. This is very similar to what I intend to achieve, I appreciate it. ps: do you have any good tuts on using Selenium, I figure it's easy to use right?
Sorry I don't have any good tutorials but it is quite intuitive to use once you've got the basics. I'd read up on 'css selectors' and if it'd help I can send my code to you [but you'll have to wait a couple of days as I'm travelling without my laptop at the moment! :)]
If you look the webpage's code, you can see that all the links are under a &lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; You could get that object and get all the &lt;a&gt; elements in there 
muh oppression 
Good luck to you. It was a shitshow when I tried it
oh yes..Thank you so much!!!! 
There was a similar problem in project Euler. I can pass you the code if you want (assuming N &lt;=1000)
The IRS could just as easily pay me 1 million a day for keeping their toilet routine a secret. This comment has been based on speculation, just like your post. 
And why should any of us care about your arbitrary downvote procedure? Are we somehow obliged to keep our comment history because some random guy (such as yourself) would prefer it? Fuck that with the largest dildo you can find.
You are under no obligation to do anything. Neither am I. And since I'm not obliged to read the rantings of a teenager with low proficiency in reading a few simple sentences, I will block you.
Have fun in the echo chamber. 
&gt; Research has shown that a programmer can output between 10–20 lines of debugged code per day. Research has shown that any paragraph that begins with "Research has shown" without actually pointing to that research is mostly bullshit.
Sometimes you *do* fight fire with fire. &gt; Other people No, just one asshole in particular.
So you tell me what gui framework should i learn? And also its tutorial link will be appreciated.
Well you'll be ecstatic to find out that this script IS written in Python. This method uses: * A 3rd party API, the TwitterAPI. * Error handling including EAFP coding style. * An infinite while loop to run continuously. * The modulo operator (%) to act as a timer. * I even show how to output different color text to the console. * Uses the collections.deque data structure to hold the last X tweets. If twitter denies a tweet for being too repeatative, the deque is incremented in size so this problem is avoided in future tweets. /s Not every Python program is going to be used in ways that agree with your senses. But I hate the orange POTUS for being an idiot and am passionate about giving him a hard time - especially after his half-hearted comments on Charlottesville, NC and hurricane Harvey. But the Python language is still there.
i have written this code : from bs4 import BeautifulSoup from urllib.request import urlopen page_url = "http://econpy.pythonanywhere.com/ex/001.html" new_file = "Real_file.csv" f = open(new_file, "w") Headers = "Header1, Header2\n" f.write(Headers) html = urlopen(page_url) soup = BeautifulSoup(html, "html.parser") buyer_info = soup.find_all("div", {"title":"buyer-info"}) for i in buyer_info: Header1 = soup.find_all("div", {"title":"buyer_name"}) Header2 = soup.find_all("spam", {"class":"item-price"}) print("Header1" + Header1) print("Header2"+ Header2) f.write(Header1 + Header2+"\n") f.close() without adding any additional code , can you make it work?
Don't get up in arms, I was just stating my experience with it. 
I prefer fish to zsh.
Um, I forget what Header1 and Header2 are in BS, but I think that doesn't work because you're converting these to strings and the representation interferes with things Also, if you're going for CSV, you aren't separating the content name and price - you forgot a comma.
There are no rules against using scripts to delete your comments. Why bother and make the delay random. 
Yup i know that. But i am asking in a general way that which framework have you used?
Anyone who thinks reddit content isn't continuously being hoovered up and mirrored by multiple nefarious named agencies doesn't understand how the internet works. A comment you post on reddit, is for all intents and purposes, no different than a stock ticker flying across the NYSE stock screener. It is public domain and guaranteed to exist somewhere for years to come.
For anyone wanting the [English version](https://medium.com/@henriquebastos/the-definitive-guide-to-setup-my-python-workspace-628d68552e14?source=user_profile---------9----------------) mentioned, but not actually linked to, in the post.
My goodness that is a depressing statistic.... 
Thanks, I actualized the link in the original post.
Also the edits can trigger the filters so even comments that are 2-3 months old will show up when edited and filled with gibberish. So it could have flooded the mods with nonsense comments that looked like spam which would trigger them to ban.
You've got a point. Feels unfair to publicly display the karma when the text is gone. Might be better if deleting a comment with a positive score also removed the karma for that comment.
That's great, I''ll look it up as well. You have been very helpful! No worries, I can definitely wait for a couple of days, enjoy your day :)
i originally saw this last night but parent commenter got a lot of what i wanted to say, though there is one thing i wanted to elaborate on: &gt; `argv` contains the arguments that the script was called with specifically `argv` is shorthand for 'argument vector", an array of arguments given to the program. to explore it, play with this simple python program: from sys import argv print(argv) now we call it with different arguments to the program: $ python /tmp/arg.py foo bar baz ['/tmp/arg.py', 'foo', 'bar', 'baz'] $ python /tmp/arg.py hello world ['/tmp/arg.py', 'hello', 'world'] as you can see the first item (`argv[0]`) is the name of the program itself. sometimes you see `sys.argc`, which is the "argument count" - or the _number_ of arguments passed to the program. `argv` and `argc` mirror functionality and names found in the standard C library arguments to the `main()` function. 
I can see why he would get banned for that, it literally looks like spam. Better to changed it to "comment deleted" or something smiilar.

i am doing it im just short of time so i need some help in solving it faster
Hey, I'm trying to make a pip installable program but am struggling packaging it to Pypi. Any tutorials or articles that helped you?
What have you tried? Where do you want **help** (as opposed to **solutions**) None of these are very difficult assignments but they will probably take over na hour!
I am not sure exactly what you want. A (manually formatted) example would be extremely helpful. But, until then, check out `sympy.pprint` and see if that looks good. Finally, you can probably write your own formatter
I tried fish...banged my head to get venv working on fish...went back to zsh
Dropbox's desktop app is in Python + PyQt.
Because packaging for different platforms is a pain, dependencies are hard to package, and GUI libraries aren't great.
For me, the karma is just the smoking gun. It's more the principle of not being adult enough to stand by what you say, even when using an alias. I've seen people with so serios insecurity, that their comments was gone 8 hours after being posted. Granted, this is at an extreme end of the rang, but basically it's the same problem. I see all erased comments as contempt for the reditor who spent time composing a reply to the now-gone comment. 
Haha go on /r/okcupid. The women there delete their comments after 10 upvotes.

Going to blast through the Django Polls Tutorial one last time as a refresher so I can build a side-project I've put on the backburner for the last six years. Planning to sit down tonight and just knock it out in one go.
That doesn't sound too hard. 
venv always builds an activate.fish file that just works.
I find the official docs are almost always a better technology in X than anything else. Most languages/libs/Frameworks have great docs quick start guides which are generally just better versions of the in X minutes ones. But in terms of getting depth of knowledge, someone else's experience is awesome.
you have to start a project, it's the only way
Yep. Tooling isn't the best when it comes to actual distribution of applications and their associated dependencies. 
no activate.fish didn't work for me in py3.5 and the version(latest) of fish I had. I had to manually change the .fish file to add something(afaik braces) to make it work. [The issue](https://github.com/pypa/virtualenv/issues/1030). Also see [virtualfish](https://github.com/adambrenecki/virtualfish).
Nothing yet. I'm only three days into my python class. Excited to get started learning though! 
If you come to honestly believe that you shouldn't have said something, I'd usually recommend editing it to ~~strike out~~ the original material you regret, then add a brief explanation of why you changed your mind. I can see a couple of cases for outright deleting, though. One is if the text is so offensive that a reasonable person would prefer not to see it even in strikethrough (e.g. overt displays of racism or sexism). Even so, I'd still leave the comment up, edited to say "what I said here was racist and I'm sorry". A similar "even if it's in strikethrough, the damage is still done" case is spoilers for a movie or game. If you've posted unmarked spoilers on a sub where spoilers are supposed to be marked, you'll obviously want to completely replace that text with a version that has the spoilers properly marked.
Great tutorial. I've been wanting to add a sensor to my front door that detects a knock and then take/send a picture. I'll prob use some of this.
&gt; Well, not many languages claim to be a general purpose language :) Julia has them for instance. What? Most languages are general purpose languages. And the point was to say that *most* languages don't have a built-in matrix type ... so giving one language doesn't really refute that. And when you offer up Julia as a language, you should realize that it will suffer the same issues that python has: try to combine the symbolic calculations with matrix calculations --- you will have the same issue that numpy has ... it doesn't support symbolic variables in its matrix routines. &gt; I think matrices are a key feature for computation in most engineering fields and the lack of a matrix standard makes everything harder than it should with every other module making their own. Then things dont work together. numpy is the de-facto standard. The only issue, if you call it that, is that it only works with that standard arithmetic base types (https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.13.0/user/basics.types.html ) and, so, doesn't work with symbolic variables. numpy covers 99% of the use-case for engineers. I should point out that when I first used matlab, it didn't have *any* symbolic calculations. It only added them to fend off competition from Mathematica.

The stack that I've found that works for me for building interactive web based data analysis apps is numpy/pandas, flask, socketio, vuejs + elemntui, and plotly. If I want something quick and throwaway though I just use [plotly dash](https://plot.ly/products/dash/).
Linux have a ton of desktop apps in Python. The problem is the "commercial" part, if you want to keep the source of the program closed, Python is hardly a good choice, because it's very easy to get back the source code from the binaries.
&gt; How difficult would it be to crack it? Just find appropriate function, change return statement to always be true and you enjoy full version. Seeing that most of the games and expensive popular software is cracked really fast, some of them even on the release date, makes compiled software also insecure. IMHO most professional software isn't cracked just because there is no real demand for it... If there is the cracks will come fast. &gt; Another reason is that Python as an interpreted language is quite slow. Actually, very slow. For the same task C functions invoked in Python can be a few HUNDRED times faster their Python equivalents. Example? NumPy, Pandas and much more data science libraries. They are all written in C and just happen to have Python API. Yes it is slower than C or Java or ASM, that's why people use Numpy/Pandas for speeding up curcial parts. But honestly for the rest python is fast enough, don't forget the program will sit and wait ages for user input or data from the network. Don't forget developer time is more expensive than throwing new hardware into the solution... That makes python great, easy and understandable to codeand you can use code written in C to speed up things. &gt; ...type safety...statically typed... Doing dynamically typing correctly leads into the same amount of bugs than statically typing. It is another pardigm, just learn to use it right. &gt; any reason your coworker modifies the function so that in can possibly return different types, it might lead to bugs. That is a documentation issuse, in statically typed languages a coworker who has problems to understand the code can also change the return type and this will lead into different bugs. Documentation and code reviews are there for help. Tests too. Has nothing to do with the typing paradigm... &gt; You might not notice it and the interpreter in many scenarios might not tell you about it. Oh, you will notice because the interpreter will stop and raise an error. Don't forget python is strongly typed. Implicit conversions won't be happen with a few exeptions like float and int. In the end documenting, code reviewing and testing will protect you more than just rely on some paradigms. &gt; I don't know if these are the actual reasons... The trend is going away from native desktop apps anyways, people don't want to bother with different platforms anymore. Big companies that providing native apps are mostly very conservative and just stick to well known techologies, which is a safe and mostly good thing. Rewriting code bases into other languages costs time and alot of money. Also the actual GUI bindings and/or GUI frameworks aren't that great. Sometimes it is hard to get into them easy or they are really old or the documentation just sucks or is incomplete.
Umm... I can only see zsh showing git-branch for the current directory, not doing it for `ls`... Am I missing something?
Thanks! Please let me know if you have any suggestions or encounter any problems :)
Is there anything in NYC?
Nowhere in your code do you attempt to print the edited file. You only read it.
That's a good start... i'd love to see how more sophisticated sound classification could be done. I was always curious how WWII submarines could classify engine sounds to know what sorts of boats were nearby. 
Mostly [this tutorial](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/distributing-packages/). Also [sample project](https://github.com/pypa/sampleproject) and [classifier list] (https://pypi.python.org/pypi?%3Aaction=list_classifiers). I'm glad to help if you have further questions. EDIT: Depending what your package is like (e.g. pure-Python modules, binaries, or executables), the setup could be quite different. It is also a good idea to look at popular packages and see how they've done things.
Thank you. That is the exact answer im looking for! :)
That is one obese prompt
I found your article useful. I didn't know it was that simple to incorporate GraphQL with existing Django models. Thanks
Did you think pypa's own [sampleproject](https://github.com/pypa/sampleproject) was in some way inadequate?
Maybe every function is creating a new drawing?
Distribution is a weak point. The entire `distutils` and `setuptools` toolchain is quite fragile. If you distribute your library as Python, it is very easy to look at a disassembled view of the byte code. This tends to require compiling all your Python libraries as Cython. What I have done when required for writing software for scientists who specifically want a Python library is build a minimal Python environment with either `conda` or `virtualenv` and then package that entire environment with a Windows installer. It's still fairly painful. Stuff like entry scripts need to be custom-modified after installation as the shebangs point to the wrong place. Why do shebangs have to have absolute paths? They're not posix shebangs... This sort of stuff is really scary to a developer. 
I don't know, I've tried the program with and without new windows, and with and without various things, but the only way they draw is separately. I did test two separate functions in another file printing hello world one after the other, so I know Python does it, just not how it does it with drawing... 
glad you liked it :D
Yeah, I guess it does now that I look at it again. I updated the text a bit.
I'm working on a python implementation of LSB steganography. It's rather slow, unfortunately, and I'm thinking about porting it to C++. The thing that's particularly time consuming, unsurprisingly, is the CPU-bound portion of iterating through pixels and ORing and ANDing bitmasks. Any optimizations and recommendations are welcome. https://github.com/GoodiesHQ/solus
Please don't do this last_focus = focuses[len(focuses) - 2] actual_focus = focuses[len(focuses) - 1] Python has a great syntax for this: last_focus = focuses[-2] actual_focus = focuses[-1]
Can you share the code?
Thanks for the tip, changed that just now
Look away please 😂
No, I don't think so. I've not seen ZSH(or any oh-my-zsh plugins) do what your utility does. 
Also, 7ou should have posted in /r/learnpython
Doing something new isn't saying that others, that do the same/similar stuff, are doing stuff inadequately, that is just a stupid and desparaging. Sometimes people like to do something good, and so what if it similar to things other are doing? That's just healthy competition to my mind and can help drive things forward (and helping on other people's projects also drives things forward, just to be clear). Anyway, I like to learn stuff, and I'm able to find the good tutorials/examples myself, so different appraches are always welcome. So thanks @kennethreithz.
Your test data all seem to be degenerate cases where x0 == x1. This causes my solver to halt at a = 1e+5 (the upper bound for the numeric solver) when it should really be a = +inf. You can add a special case to the solver like if abs(x1 - x0) &lt; 1e-5 or abs(v / h) &gt; 1e+5: xm = (x0 + x1) / 2 ym = (y0 + y1 - length) / 2 a = float("+inf") return xm, ym, a
Great stuff! You should do one using fft analysis. I've found that to be incredibly useful for lots of applications and I think a lot of people here would like it.
I definitely thought this was going to be about FFTs. 
How can one write an obvious typo in as big letters as this heading and not have it spring in his eyes? I basically agree, although in my experience it's far easier to run into bare metal number crunching territory and have it destroy a python programs performance than the author outlines the issue. Also he could have mentioned Cython, which is spot on what he's talking about
Depends on the position. Is it a web-based company or is it an engineering company?
Coroutines (not just generators) Decorators Advanced class construction and topics C/Cython extensions Data structures Ability to debug and profile code Tests
A lot of municipal governments have entry level programming jobs. I talked with the person in charge of IT for my city, and he's always looking for entry level talent. He doesn't expect he can hold onto talent more than 8-10 months before they've hired away for higher pay. However, the project's cities have usually involved a lot of data scrubbing and analysis which is great experience. Pay is going to be low though. 
I didn't even know the Navigator was a thing. Just use the command line. It's super easy. At least on Windows, your Anaconda should be high on your path so it doesn't have to search as many files to find the libraries.
When can we use `pyproject.toml`?
Then C and C++ _what_? Don't leave us hanging!
So THAT's what that means! I kept seeing it and even tried it out but it never made sense to me until now. I guess it's just one of those things so simple they fly over my head if I think too hard about them. Thank you. 
I thought it would be using deep learning
like [poet](https://github.com/sdispater/poet)?
To print nice things in notebooks, just return an object that returns HTML from _repr_html_(). 
Do you have a line which is calling each function? Is the first function using return? It would be easier to fix if you give us an example of the code you are using.
Thank you for this. The data I posted was incorrect, if you look at it all x0 == x1. I'm working in a 3d space and in context my starting point and ending point have the same x and the curve is taking place on the yz plane. I printed the wrong values. I thought the error might be the way i'm calculating the arc_length. This morning I working on calculating the arc length via integration and come up with this. def arc_length(start, end, a, xm): # page 5, http://scholarcommons.usf.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4835&amp;context=ujmm integrand = lambda x: (cosh((x - xm) / a)) return integrate.quad(integrand, start, end) and when I compare the arc_length with the wanted length my error is less than 1e-3. Thanks for your help. I'm a software engineering student working with a Mechanical Engineer on a project and I have been on and off of this problem for weeks now. Thank you. 
I like asking about metaclasses and `__slots__`. Also MRO.
You are very welcome! Note that the analytic solution for length is simply def catenary_length(xm, a, x0, x1): return abs(a * (sinh((x1 - xm) / a) - sinh((x0 - xm) / a))) although if you use my patch code above you should also work in something like if a == float("+inf"): length = y0 + y1 - 2 * ym 
Sublime Text is partially written in Python.
I have found that on my mac, Anaconda is slightly slower than the built-in python (both 2.7) but only slightly. I've heard it has to do with the compiler flags and tuning but I really don't know. Try the command line!
I'm starting to think I choosed the title poorly, since it gives the impression I'm doing complex stuff(I'm not). About fft analysis, my idea was to do another post about different peak finding algorithms(but not really covering applications this time).
1) For a start, that project doesn't read the version number from your code, meaning you have to sync it across 2 files. 2) Why are you here? Did you think C was inadequate? :-)
Since I made this post I did check the Anaconda Prompt on windows and it is a bit faster but not by that much. Plus the prompt itself is less than ideal to work with. It's nothing like the linux terminal I'm used to. The 'clear' command doesn't work well and for whatever reason the window is not letting me scroll all the way up. If i do 'conda list' I can only see a portion of it. I'm sure there's a workaround to it, I just don't see why it has to be more complicated than the standalone installations of scipy and related apps. I installed Anaconda to make my life easier and it's proving to do the opposite lol. 
The conda functions are faster from the terminal, but opening apps like Spyder or RStudio is still fairly slow. 
`print(target.read())` He did 
That could be cool! What about a follow up post where you use fft to classify the sound as a knock or just some other loud noise? Maybe just classification in general? /u/Jimmaplesong mentioned classifying submarines by sound, that could be a cool fft demonstration. I don't think audio analysis gets enough love, which is unfortunate because it's very fascinating. So I'd be very excited for more posts.
Thank you Kenneth. You never fail to amaze me. :)
I use Excel quite a bit, though sometimes there is just too much data to plot efficiently in excel without running into rendering issues. Good to bring it up though, as it's a key part of the toolkit. ;)
Perhaps reading the grammar of graphics book might help make ggplot easier to work with. This also has trouble with large data points, though. I often find myself simply wanting to create scatter plots, quickly changing the variables used in the plot, or transforming the variables. E.g.: y ~ x or y ~ log(x), etc
You could do both. Pattern recognition could be a deep learning thing. But in order to turn audio data into something that could even use, you'd definitely want an FFT in there.
This process is called "freezing". There are several tools available to do it; [here's a quick overview](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/shipping/freezing/). You should note that unlike other ("compiled") languages, this is not something that python was designed to do. Python is a scripting language, and was designed for the .py files to be distributed. --- If you have more questions like this it's better to post them on /r/learnpython. Be sure to [format your code for reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/faq#wiki_how_do_i_format_code.3F) or use a site like pastebin. Also, include which version of python and what OS you are using. 
The first few layers of a conv net on an audio signal actually resemble a function similar to dft, but the representation is tailored through training.
wtf, that file has tons of the antipatterns ... kenneth strikes again :(
Saw Kenneth Reitz in the title - automatic upvote.
[The Docs on file I/O](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#reading-and-writing-files) [This SO](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1466000/python-open-built-in-function-difference-between-modes-a-a-w-w-and-r) might be interesting too. For me it does print the contents of the file, but f.write() adds characters to the file that I don't want... But I suggest you read the docs first, and maybe that SO too. And next time, please format your submissions, by adding 4 spaces in front of lines that are code.
Although I don't like to use it myself for argument lists (but I do use similar formatting for other lists, dicts, etc. depending on the context), formatting very similar to yours is shown in [PEP8: Style Guide for Python Code](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008) in the [When to use trailing commas](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#id29) section, and for the same reason: "when a list of values, **arguments** or imported items is **expected to be extended over time**".
Oh damn Python 3
Again, where is Anaconda on your path? Path ordering is super important for responsiveness on Windows if you have lots of things on there.
I'm not sure, wherever the default installation path is. I think c:\users\username\Anaconda2
For data analysis, in no particular order, a 'full-stack' developer might have: 1. Familarity with NumPy/Scipy/Pandas stack 2. Cython and/or C-extensions 3. Facility with C-99 (see above) 4. Human interface (either GUI or web-based) 5. Plotting 6. Local machine code acceleration (Numba/NumExpr/concurrent.futures) 7. Distributed machine multi-processing (Dask or high-performance computing equivalents) 8. 'Machine learning' like `scipy.optimize` or automation, depending on the job. 9. Data management (streaming IO on local/network, memory mapping, serialization protocols) 10. Automated testing with `unittest` or `pytest`. If multi-platform is required this should also include knowledge of CI on Gitlab or similar. 
I like the topic a lot, I'll be giving some throught to these ideas!
It would be nice if you could point out those anti-patterns.
/u/kennethreitz, I was under the impression that `setup.py upload` was being actively discouraged. Did that change? Wasn't `twine` created specifically for the purpose of uploading tarballs to pypi? 
Thanks for sharing this, I always find it annoying dealing with setup.py, it's one of those write once and forget tasks.
setup.py upload is not secure with Python &lt; 2.7.10 
Indeed he did, sorry reading on mobile and only seen the read bit without print. This behavior seems strange, the permissions are set and OP didn't mention any errors (Like if the file did not exist)
How do you get the version from your code? Most solutions seem to bring their own problems. Ex. https://github.com/python-quantities/python-quantities/issues/122 
I wouldn't say there are no desktop apps built with Python, you just won't find such apps for sale. The reasons should be obvious, effectively you give away your source code which can be an issue if the app is for a commercial venture. Beyond that Python sucks for performance which is always an issue where an app will have competition. The only good thing with respect to performance is that modern hardware makes it a bit harder to notice. Lastly Python can be a bit of a pain for large teams as you don't have the massive number of tools to manage your code the way C++ or some of the other languages do.
I was gonna buy his course on Udemy, but I found a python course with double the students, and the same rating. So i'm gonna go with that instead.
That's not what I'm asking. If on the Windows command line (so cmd and not powershell), you type: echo %PATH% you'll see something like: C:\Program Files\Microsoft MPI\Bin\;C:\Anaconda2\;C:\Anaconda2\Scripts;C:\WINDOWS\system32;C:\WINDOWS;C:\WINDOWS\System32\Wbem;C:\cygwin\bin;C:\WINDOWS\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\;C:\bin;C:\Program Files\Git\cmd;C:\Program Files\TortoiseSVN\bin;C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\8.1\Windows Performance Toolkit\;C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\110\Tools\Binn\;C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SDKs\TypeScript\1.0\;C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\120\Tools\Binn\;C:\ProgramData\Oracle\Java\javapath;C:\Program Files (x86)\NVIDIA Corporation\PhysX\Common;C:\Program Files (x86)\Graphviz2.38\bin;C:\Program Files\MiKTeX 2.9\miktex\bin\x64\;C:\Program Files (x86)\MiKTeX 2.9\miktex\bin\;C:\Program Files\doxygen\bin;C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\Compiler\Fortran\10.1.011\\EM64T\Lib;C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\Compiler\Fortran\10.1.011\ \EM64T\bin;C:\Program Files\TortoiseGit\bin;C:\Users\myuser\AppData\Local\Microsoft\WindowsApps; I can speed things up by putting Anaconda higher on the path at the expense of other programs on my path. I couldn't care less if something that is launching a GUI increases the load time from 10 seconds to 10.5 seconds, but I care a lot about something that only runs for 0.1 seconds that I use to query system info.
Is it really that hard to understand that python and c++ are drastically different and are used for different purposes. They are two different tools in a developer's toolbox. If you need to "manually" manage memory, speed is an issue, or you need to take advantage of multi-threading/async capabilities, then use c++. Otherwise, if you are network limited, you have some other bottleneck in your system, or simply don't care about speed, feel free to use python. I have no idea why people feel the constant need to compare a static-typed unmanaged language to a managed duck-typed language. 
What does the pay tend to be? Also, what do they get hired for?
You're going to get lots of opinions about it but it passes PEP8 so you're good.
You're going to get lots of opinions about it but it passes PEP8 so you're good.
I just have a text file and read a string from it. I didn't even know people were using fancy libraries for that. Maybe that's why they break?
Let's hear your webdev advanced topics.
It's nice to have this reference that focuses only on setup.py specifically. I find the "For Humans" thing a bit stale. I know it's part of Kenneth's personal brand or whatever but it's odd to me.
What library did you use
`['title']` is extracting the value of the `title` attribute so you can just change `title` to `href`
You could also use video for this, in case a criminal just peers through a window or something instead of knocking. I originally did something like this using tutorials and stuff on [this website](http://www.pyimagesearch.com/2015/05/25/basic-motion-detection-and-tracking-with-python-and-opencv/) combined with Flask before eventually moving on to [MotionEye OS](https://github.com/ccrisan/motioneyeos). (I think the guy who runs the first site sells some books and stuff too, but I didn't buy anything, the free materials were more than enough to get me started) I now have MotionEye OS set up inside so it covers my door and windows facing the alley (the high risk entry points for an intruder compared to those facing the street). The software includes all sorts of settings and integration with cloud storage providers so it can send pix and a video to the cloud before an intruder can destroy the camera, if they notice it. (I have it set up with Google Drive, but I think there are options for Dropbox etc too). Edit: I also used an infrared PiCamera and some infrared LEDs so it works at night when my indoor lights are off.
I reread [this article](https://medium.com/@trstringer/the-future-is-looking-bright-for-python-95a748a4ef3e) and looked at the StackOverflow graphs again also. Python is still trending nicely positively. Also, [questions specifically on Python3.x are now vastly ahead of questions specifically on Python2](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/trends?tags=python-2.7%2Cpython-3.x). Anyway, just some observations, take these for what they're worth.
I use a regex to parse the value of `__version__` in my main `__init__.py`. Only have to keep it in one place *and* you don't have to import your package!
* `sys.version_info` should be extras_require * Missing setup.cfg for universal_wheels * Loading the `__version__` from the module, the module should load it from `pkg_resources`, or just not include `__version__` * Pointless hacky `if sys.argv[-1] == "publish"` * No changelog I personally use zest.releaser and a minimal setup.py
Is there a good reason for using a `__version__.py` instead of using something like `setuptools-scm`? 
could it have to do with your X11 server?
i agree 100% haha
Just saying... the term full-stack is a bit misplaced in this context.
Download the app 'ConEmu' for Windows and use that instead of the Windows command prompt, and launch your scripts from there. 
I honestly have no idea. The non-Anaconda version of RStudio for example boots faster than the Anaconda version. The difference is pretty noticeable. Wouldn't that affect both? 
`if sys.argv[-1] == "publish"`? I thought the intended pattern was to subclass `setuptools.Command` and `setup(cmdclass=whatever)`. Why?
This is a huge understatement. Tried rolling out a small python gui app to our global workforce, and python's not on our standard desktop image. Many folks are stuck on third-world VPN. So anyone who tries to run it whines at the initial 25MB+ install and the clunky Tkinter performance. 
How so? The stack is very different set of technologies, yes. A data analysis life cycle might look like this: 1. Engineer gives device to characterization lab. 2. Lab loads device into instrument, sets up the instrument. Instrument analyzes device using an automated data collection protocol (Python). Let's say the device produces 1 GB/s with a duty cycle of 25 %. 3. I write a plugin for the instrument (C) that takes the raw data, compresses it with c-blosc, and then routes it off elsewhere with ZeroMQ. 4. One of the the processing nodes accepts the incoming data, and starts analyzing it (Python) using CPU and GPU processing. Analysis finishes or errors, an HTML report is generated, and it is emailed to the engineer who submitted the job. If the engineer looks at the report. If they find a problem with the device and needs to do additional analysis, they have a GUI app and they use links in the HTML report to download the appropriate data. Otherwise their work is done. A web-stack might be Python-backend/Javascript front-end with http protocols. The technologies here are different, the amount of data is higher than most web applications but it's coming in a much more defined pattern from a limited number of known machines. You need basically everything I listed above to be able to manage that system.
I'm not sure on the details, but it has to be very entry level. We used to have one of those expensive coding boot camp schools here (Iron Yard). I was told the city would higher graduates that took the HTML/CSS/JS bootcamp course. Then they'd usually get hired away by one of the tech companies in the area.
I use it because that way I don't need an anvil to do something like: import subprocess def get_git_revision_short_hash(): try: #ghash = subprocess.check_output(['git', 'rev-parse', '--short', 'HEAD']) # independent of package location as long as there is a git folder # what about if you use setup_user.py install? # what about if you don't have git? # can raise a subprocess.CalledProcessError, which means the return code != 0 ghash = subprocess.check_output(['git', 'describe', '--always'], cwd=os.path.dirname(__file__)) ghash = ghash.decode('utf-8').rstrip() except: # git isn't installed ghash = 'no.checksum.error' return 'dev.%s' % ghash revision = get_git_revision_short_hash() __version__ = '1.1.0+%s' % revision It's one less dependency. On release, I drop the git hash.
The non-standard libraries I used were praw (to post on Reddit), BeautifulSoup (to scrape buzzfeeds archive), and langdetect (to make sure the articles posted were in English)
Hence the quotation marks, I expect.
python(or python3) script_name.py example:(in python 3.x) python3 C:/Users/&lt;user_name&gt;/Desktop/python_script.py 
CPython installs the [Python launcher](https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#python-launcher-for-windows) by default on Windows, so it's better to use `py script.py` Edit: I forgot that CPython associates .py-files with the py launcher and marks them as executable, so it should work with just running `script.py` from the command line, and Windows will run them just as it runs .bat-files for instance. 
i thing better use IDE like **PyCharm**
Why would that be relevant in this case?
Use gunicorn. There are no readable docs for uwsgi and what they do have online will drive you mad if you let it. Whatever theoretical speed advantage uwsgi has is washed out by the impossibility of properly configuring it. 
Just advice
The best, hardest, most rewarding course, take it multiple times it's worth it.
I’m reading through the entire documentation of the Python standard library. I’ve already gotten through the actual language reference, and I find it highly interesting (I like to get technical sometimes)
I don't see a problem with it, but have no doubt someone will.
Similarly you can reverse an array by incrementing through the indices by `-1`: &gt;&gt;&gt; A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] &gt;&gt;&gt; A[::-1] [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
For "different peak finding algorithms", the basic idea with FFT is to use the same thing that's used for Canny edge detection in images. Simply create a convolutional kernel that's similar to the first derivative and convolve with your signal. This will get only transients, *and* the transient height, and will ignore louder non-peak values. It's best to smooth out the signal first via Gaussian blurring or similar with another convolutional kernel.
Would you suggest taking it via this outlet? I've think the "same course" is offered in a few places. How much of a time commitment per week would you it is? Thank you.
Just a point of terminology, since I see the word "anti-pattern" used a lot on the Internet. &gt; According to the authors of *Design Patterns*, there must be at least two key elements present to formally distinguish an actual anti-pattern from a simple bad habit, bad practice, or bad idea: &gt; 1. A commonly used process, structure or pattern of action that despite initially appearing to be an appropriate and effective response to a problem, has more bad consequences than good ones 2. Another solution exists that is documented, repeatable and proven to be effective. [Anti-Pattern on Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-pattern) You can see lots of examples of anti-patterns in that article. One thing they all have in common is that they're high-level. They have to do with how people _organize_ code or projects, not with the minutiae of implementation. The only anti-pattern you _might_ be guilty of here is [bike-shedding](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_triviality). ;-) All that said, the most important thing with code style is to be consistent. If you work for a company, follow their style guide. If you're working alone, or if your company doesn't have one, find one. For Python, [PEP-8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) is almost always a safe choice.

Why not use the API? https://coinmarketcap.com/api/
What about entry level data analysis?
It might be possible to restrict oneself to the rpython subset and let pypy transpile it to C which in theory should work on any system. Until you need a GUI, that is. Compiling even trivial rpython code takes an excessively long time, so it might be out of question for any commercial application. 
im fucking retarded.
Not really, not only this. Flit has more powers, it generates universal wheels by defult, it respects your .gitignore so you dont have to deal with `MANIFEST.in` files.
/u/kennethreitz I am using Flit and I like Flit's style. https://github.com/takluyver/flit - Currently uses `flit.ini` (but in future when [PEP 517](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0517/) is accepted it will use `pyproject.toml`) - Uses `.gitignore` instead of `MANIFEST.in` - Universal builds by default - Transform .md in .rst for PyPI (because ReST sucks) Flit has a lot to improve but it is a nice tool and can evolve together with PEP517

If the receiver restricts the loading of globals, does this change anything at all? If you can access any module that imports `sys`, then you get access to `importlib`. Or `os` and you can use `os.system` again. `multiprocessing` = `Popen`, and so on. Or am I mistaken? 
I may update this to use twine. Want to send a pull request?
Why can't there be healthy competition?
You should see the Requests codebase!
How did you get this error!? Because here the site is ok!! 
I haven't tried setuptools-crm myself — do you like it?
Looks extremely nice! I'm going to have to try it out!
Looks like you need more of a pure graphics library. You may consider VisPy, VTK (python wrappers) or pyopengl. There are more but these first come to mind. VTK is probably the most capable here, but also has the highest learning curve. 
By outlet do you mean Edx.org? I personally have only seen this course show up on this website. I think it's a good platform. On the course page it estimates the commitment time on the website is 15 hours per week. I did the course self-paced, and didn't follow a strict schedule. But I would say that you could finish the material for each week in under 5 hours if you're in a rush and work efficiently. I don't think it's a good idea to rush through it though, and it's definitely worthwhile the play with the concepts that have been taught each week on your own to really make sure that they sink in.
wow, 25MB+ install is the problem--- I think I found the other real problem there....Once you find an approach/frame for python GUI it isn't too bad (at least from my experience).
Hey I'm looking at the API, but I am now parsing the string. Is this the only way to do it? I can't find a command for just the price.. :l
`price_usd` What are you "parsing"?
I wonder why go isn't anywhere to be seen 
how do I use the price_usd command?
Umm...it's not a command. It's a JSON string. You should take some time to learn about JSON and RESTful APIs. There are no commands here, just data.
Oh. See what I did is turn it into a string, and find the index of the word "price" then added 13 to the index to get to the first number, then read the number until a comma was read. 
The API is probably the best way to do it, but to answer your specific question about BeautifulSoup: import requests from bs4 import BeautifulSoup soup = BeautifulSoup(requests.get('https://coinmarketcap.com/').content, 'lxml') bitcoin_price_link = soup.find('a', class_='price', href='/currencies/bitcoin/#markets') print(bitcoin_price_link.string) - $4390.45
You don't need `setup.cfg` for universal wheels, actually. Anyway, if you have changes to suggest, I encourage pull requests!
Gotta stick to the brand :) 
If I was stuck on an island and had to choose one thing to have with me, it'd be python. That way I can die doing what I love.
It should also be noted that this is also just a start of the repo — I made in about 20 minutes this morning. I intend to add Changelog and other things to it. 
I don't use versions of python older than latest, typically, so this has never effected me — however, the repo should be updated to twine. I personally have only used twine once or twice — and I maintain a *lot* of libraries. 
If someone downloads a tarball of the code, what does setuptools-crm think the version is?
It's just something I've done in literally all of my projects, always. I think I stole it from /u/defunkt way back in the day. It's easy to remember. 
THANK U SO MUCH.
Because no sane software engineer bets the farm on a n00b.
15 hours/week?! I'd start with reading/working through SICP.
Seriously though, use the API. Look up how to work with [JSON](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html), it's the better option. import requests r = requests.get('https://api.coinmarketcap.com/v1/ticker/bitcoin/') print(r.json()[0]['price_usd']) - 4394.25 
One is a subset of the other?
the farm? i would just expect it to be on the graph somewhere but ok. 
Very cool. I love projects like these, where you get to tie together several different disciplines.
too bad you didn't choose a system to run python. instead you'll die slowly with python on a USB drive and nothing to plug it into.
Omg almost every comment here has different suggestion for completely different packaging methods / helpers. How can such a great language with such a nice module system have such a confusing packaging situation! So frustrating.
What if he crafted a physical manifestation of the python interpreter out of bamboo?
Just one question: **What is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?**
African or European?
That's awesome to see, I love Python. It is such a versatile and fun programming language.
It gets a lot more complicated. For a lot of problems the source filter mode is used. That is there is a filter that is basically static (representing the shape of an "instrument" and its resonances) and a source that stimulates it dynamically. For an instrument like a bugle which has no valves, the filter is linear time invariant and source is changing. The convolution of the source and filter is any given note. For valved instruments there is a different filter for each valve combination. For the human voice the filter is the body shape and source is the aspiration of air. For a reciprocating engine the filter is the unique characteristics of the engine and source varies with the engine speed. Typically it takes frequency domain analysis to separate the source and filter. 
A senior developer developing *with* python or *developing* python? Also, don't focus too heavily on what they currently know. Look at how quickly they adapt to learning new skills. Someone may have never touched a specific skill simply because their career path hasn't lead them there. I'd hire a 'full stack' web developer engineer that knew 4 different frameworks (because that's what their previous customers wanted) for a data analytics job any day over a data analytics engineer that knows 1 framework, has only ever used it and took a year to get proficient on it. Because when a new version comes or we need to try another tool the 'web developer' will be up to speed fast. I have co-workers that almost literally shut down when something is new. We're on Python 2.4 for some things and I had to look up if ctypes existed for a project we're on. It's not my choice. But I can either argue that Python 3 is the future and do no work and pout in the corporate environment or I can swear under my breath and pick up a 'new' language. 
yes
Does it matter? Are you looking for a senior level developer or a senior level coder? They're different jobs at some companies (and should be at others). Pick the person that seems most apt to learning quickly and learning on the job.
As long as it's Python 3.x then I guess it's ok.
If you are curious, look into DEMON analysis and LOFARGRAM. There were operators trained to learn how to identify the patterns and more recently there is research and probably actual use of machine learning in such systems.
I didn't have a chance to dig into your code, yet, so maybe this is redundant. Or possibly something you've already seen (it's been around a while). But this anecdote (I believe by Guido van Rossum), helped me quite a bit with optimization issues. Basically, use implied loops and other built-ins wherever you can, since they're already implemented in C. https://www.python.org/doc/essays/list2str/
[extremely relevant ](https://youtube.com/watch?v=RZ4Sn-Y7AP8) David Beasley talks about the time he was stuck in a vault with several terabytes of data to process. Such an entertaining talk
It irks me that the `.py` are shifted to the right from their location in Dvorak.
I'm just trying to help :)
A bone-simple Wiki engine built around Python Markdown and implemented as a Flask blueprint. It uses flat text files to store pages, so I can edit them with something a little more flexible than a &lt;textarea&gt; - although it has that, too. Simple per-page permissions, tacked onto the document in YAML, and a flexible enough back-end that it would be fairly simple to add some other form of page persistence (like SQL or MongoDB or something). Small and low on prerequisites, so I can attach a Wiki to any other Flask app quickly and easily, to provide built-in docs or whatever else.
I have gotten this to work for you. There is a bug in the dependencies list for the winshell package. The pypiwin32 package is required. This bug has already been reported to the maintainers of the winshell package, but unfortunately it appears that the maintainers have stopped supporting it. I used the winshell package from http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#winshell since it is newer (ver. 0.6.4) than the one on PyPI (ver. 0.6). See https://stackoverflow.com/q/227928 for more information and helpful links. pip install pypiwin32 [Download Gohlke's package to a local folder, C:\downloads\new in this example.] pip install C:\downloads\new\winshell-0.6.4-py2.py3-none-any.whl
I 100% agree with this, even just at a logical level. Venvs are basically a "project" instance of your python path. To me, the thought of using apt is completely unthinkable if for no other reason than I will certainly have to use pip to install other dependencies, so why introduce a second package manager into the equation when pip will cover nearly any python package that you actually want to use? Python libraries are not software on your system per se. Rather, they are source code to be distributed with the runtime, of a program that will presumably be running on other systems at some point. Why use an OS-level package manager when there is more specific tooling available? It's not like there are binaries and OS-level registry/configuration sorts of things, which is honestly what system installations are for. pip freeze This should produce a list of your project dependencies to be included in a requirements.txt. That's common sense.
What would be the easiest way to get this to run on a mac if at all? I really wanna play!
I'm planning to do this while also working on MOOC.fi OOP Java1 class. Hope I don't mix things up too much.
No. I'm an aerospace engineer that codes. Literally an engineer, so somebody who graduated with a degree from the college of Engineering. The CS people we're hired that do mechanical engineering coding have a huge disadvantage. Regardless, things like numpy, scipy, matplotlib, h5py, pandas, etc are kind of important. Knowing how to vectorize code is not something you do as a web developer.
Along with a [volleyball version](https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/s320x320/e35/12819105_931125590336895_2095785688_n.jpg) of Guido he can yell at about the GIL.
A hybrid. Be very afraid.
I don't know if this course is hosted in other places, I'm pretty sure it's Edx.org only. They have their own custom grader build into the platform. The time I actually finished it I spend about 1 or 2 hours a day until I run out of that weeks course work. I took this course multiple times, I would say to finish it you have to be very consistent. If you are newbie a lot of things won't make sense and takes a long time for your brain to adjust to these concepts. Be consistent that is the key.
Updated with twine support!
It's funny. This discussion obviously devolved a lot, but it helped me to realize a context in which what you are describing would actually make a lot of sense. At first I was like, "Woah, python dependencies in apt, NO THANKS!". ...But python is a multifaceted tool, and people use it for lots of different things. If you are running system python in a way that you expect it to have access to a large array of non-python dependencies, a deb installer makes perfect sense. Especially if you aren't planning to bundle those dependencies into your own project for distribution. It's more in the space of an "application" at that point, rather than some module level dependency.
Also, back in the day, setuptools wasn't able to be a hard dependency — it was import setuptools, fallback on distutils. Things have changed now, so this file can be upgraded finally :)
Golang is a little too specialized based on my experience. It's like C for people who don't like C. It can talk to other languages but only through protocols (with the exception of `cgo` which loses the major selling points of the language: building and distribution). So I have a language that I can near-instantly build a Win64, Win32, BSD, Linux, and MacOSX executable on any development platform, but I can only build server apps... It's a logical conundrum, the things the language would be best-suited for are local applications, but instead it revolves around cloud back-ends on servers which are almost certainly a flavour of Linux. My feeling is the time spent developing Golang and its nice standard library, would have been better spent developing an alternative toolchain and alternative standard library for C. 
My preference is to fit them all on one line where possible. When that extends past the allowed line width, I write one item per line as in your example. Doesn't matter if it's a function definition or call or list comprehension or whatever else. Trailing commas always where possible. Open paren (or bracket or brace) on the first line, closed one on a line by itself lined up with the start of the first line. As always it's better to follow the existing project style, whatever it is, if working on something established.

All MIT courses are free online, I believe.
Yeah I can understand that. Python just really needs some architectural changes in terms of processing. it has some decent tools but in the end it can be one of the slowest languages on the market and when used in scale it can have issues that seem unnecessary for a mature and popular programming language. I have loved learning it and it's great for getting functional ideas and prototypes out. But i consistently have to convert modules to Node JS or other more streamlined and stable languages. I have not checked out PyPi yet and i'm sure i'm failing badly at being pythonic. But just my perspective making my first full scale app with Python.
Clone the repo! It's pretty straightforward to run if you already have python 2.7 installed. Just pip install the dependencies and it _should_ run right out of the box.
OK, here's the weird thing I find: In PowerShell, if I run a script.py with `python .\script.py` or `python .\script.py` then any printed text is output/displayed to the PowerShell console. However, if I just run `.\script.py` then a Command Prompt window pops up and then immediately closes. Not sure how to "fix" this... 
Trending in Python mirrors big data interest.
I started a Slack group for this course so we can help each other. Will also bring on a couple of people who are currently privately tutoring me in Python https://join.slack.com/t/redditmitedxpython/shared_invite/MjMyNDc3ODk0MTEzLTE1MDM5NzY4OTMtY2E3ZDYzMDQ1Yg 
Sounds like there's something wrong with the file extension association. Check if .py is included in the PATHEXT environment variable (all these commands are regular cmd commands, not powershell): &gt; echo %PATHEXT% .COM;.EXE;.BAT;.CMD;.VBS;.VBE;.JS;.JSE;.WSF;.WSH;.MSC;.PY;.PYW How are .py files run? &gt; assoc .py .py=Python.File &gt; ftype Python.File Python.File="C:\WINDOWS\py.exe" "%L" %* So the same could be achieved by just running `py .\script.py argument1 argument2`, if `py` is installed. All of this should be taken care of by the Python installer by the way. The command prompt window is probably closed immediately because the program exits. You could add `input("Press enter to continue")` at the end of your script and it should wait for you.
Perhaps people are just better at Java and don’t need assistance? Haha. Who am I kidding. Python for everything. 
 &gt; senior level developer or a senior level coder? Same difference. Both words are used interchangeably in the real world. However, job titles typically use the word "developer" or "software engineer" interchangeably. I'm yet to see a company which advertises both "coder" and "developer" positions
No, I think you're doing things the correct way. Python is a prototyping language. The key is to try and build the prototype, get it working, and then after profiling replace only the parts you must with faster code through extensions or multi-core libraries. The weak-side of Python (which in my professional experience is the most pressing problem) is the distribution. We need stuff like a generation package to generate the boilerplate for a C-lib. At the same time, we have `ctypes`, `f2py`, `pythonnet`, etc. If you need to interact with a MS .COM in Python you can do that (`pywin32` is ugly but works just fine). I've tried to call COM methods in `cgo`; I didn't succeed. I'm not in the web-end of development, so for me there's a more heavily populated ecosystems of acceleration tools: Cython, Numba, NumExpr (which I'm actively developing), Dask, etc. and NumPy itself is designed to be called from C. For web stuff, you have the core libraries (like async), and some of the Facebook stuff (Tornado) but looking from the outside it seems less developed. I suspect that is due to the impact of Java and Javascript derivatives providing a practical alternative that doesn't exist in scientific computing.
why not put this under java subreddit.
 &gt; when I writing functions or methods (or when calling them), I will place each argument on its own line with a trailing comma: This is clearly a bad idea. And I hope you can see why. There are deep analogies between reading code and reading text. I cannot imagine 1 word per line being a good idea in general either for text or for code. (That's apart from severe HI aspects of excessive scrolling) In this particular case, you should view your function definition/call as a "sentence" rather than a set of disjoint words and format them accordingly.. (Single line of reasonable length). The only major exception which I can think of is this: if you want (hopefully for a good reason) to add end-of-line comments to every parameter. This is fairly common for function defs, it should be _very_ rare for function calls. Edit: another major exception is when you have per parameter logic (e.g. parameters are expressions). There are possibly others, but the they are still exceptions..
Sharing knowledge on how the Python packaging ecosystem works is great, but rather than creating ad-hoc code examples on how to create packages or scaffold any sort of project, I feel like we should really be taking advantage of [**cookiecutters**](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter) to systematize the process of sharing scaffolds/workflows. I have a [**rather opinionated cookiecutter**](https://github.com/knowsuchagency/cookiecutter-pypackage) for creating Python 3 packages that not only demonstrate how to create a good (IMHumbleO) setup.py and setup.cfg, but also make it really simple to build your docs using sphinx and have them published to github pages automatically among other things. It even has a ready-made Pipfile for use with future Python packaging tools.
so foo_bar_bar_foo_bah_baz_foo() Is _clearly_ a good name as it passes pep8? Hint: passing pep8 is not a replacement (and not even an indicator) of good judgment

What is SCIP?
I have gone back and forth on this, but I currently prefer keeping the close paren with the last list item, and leaving off the trailing comma. It makes commits a little less clean, but it's still pretty easy to interpret in a diff. The biggest reason is for readability: it's easy to tell when the last item in the list is seen, and you don't have a trailing parenthesis on its own line which you have to visually line up and verify as you read. This is slightly more likely to lead to a parentheses error, but I use pretty aggressive static analysis and style linting in my editor, and they catch mistakes like that right away, so visually catching syntax errors isn't a huge concern. If I can fit all the params on one line, I do. (Edit: typo)
You have not any understanding what you are talking about. Python was made for a specific domain and as such Python has advantages and disadvantages as any language. 
I'd like to know that they - Understand the python object model (at least a passing understanding of metaclasses, slots, and descriptors, as well as how inheritance works), bonus points for recent additions like `__prepare__` and `__init_subclass__`, but also simpler things like when `__new__` is useful - Understand python's ABCs and inferred types (ie. Iterable, Iterator, Generator, etc.) - Understand the c-level data model (ie. at a high level how an int, a list, and a dict are laid out in memory), bonus points if they are actually correct about the way a dict works in cpython, but simply understanding how an unoptimized dict would work is fine. - Know why a list comprehension is faster than a for loop (which really is to say understand how bytecode is generated, at high level) - Advanced unittesting. Mocks, patches, possibly a more advanced library like pytest - Working knowledge of recent features (async/await, type hints) - A decent knowledge of the important parts of the standard library: `math`, `itertools`, `functools`, `random`, `collections`, `logging`, `sys`, `os`, and `threading`/`multiprocessing`/`asyncio` (I realize these aren't the same, but still). That is, I'd expect a senior dev to know what `contextlib.contextmanager`, `functools.wraps`, and `itertools.chain` were, and when/why one might want to use them. No need to know every function, but where to look at least. - A decent knowledge of some non-standard library modules in the domain. This would highly depend on the field, but scipy stack, django/flask/sqla/jinja2, etc. - Know at least one sane way to manage environments. This could be a bare venv, or it could be a docker based solution, or a combination, or pipenv, but *something*
What do you mean with "generation packages"? And what about saying that numpy is designed to be called *from* C?
The other slack group for may is dead. So you could use that instead of creating more.
B... but StackOverflow is a questions website. Doesn't ranking high up there also mean that a big portion of the questions are about the language's quirks, and those of its frameworks? I'd assume that's one of the main reasons JavaScript and Java sit at the top, alongside popularity of course.
sampleproject was created, in part, because there have been a number of blog posts and articles like yours created by citizens of the python community over the years, surely with all the best intentions. Unfortunately the vast majority of them were not active documents and eventually got out of date / could even be misleading.
I like the concepts in CS50, but as a person who needs to learn Python I prefer this one if you only have the time for one. It's not a complete waste of time to do both though at all, from what I can tell.
Because python started the package management game early on, when there were heaps of mistakes to be made and almost no prior experience to draw upon to avoid them. Unfortunately since then improving it since then while keeping backwards compatibility and not breaking everything while fixing it has been a long, slow hard slog.
I applied for the new grad position already and even if I don't get that position now what would position me for future roles with Yelp?
&gt; But i consistently have to convert modules to Node JS or other more streamlined and stable languages. You putting nodejs in that streamlined and stable language category? I would like to see the module that is broken in py and can get fixed by just rewriting in node. I believe it is more the rethinking redesigning of the problem that fixed the module. My node experience is a wild wild west 2013, express 2, cluster(f$%ck), non stable api. I'm sure from node 4 it got better. But node/js "won". Because it was the interpreter we but on every desktop and mobile device for the Millennials to run with... and did they run!
have a look at http://vpython.org/
This is great, a lot to investigate and understand here.

If you want to avoid rewriting it from scratch, using [GTK 3 with Python](http://python-gtk-3-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) is probably easier. Tkinter still works, and there's nothing wrong with using it for simple applications. It is a fairly basic toolkit, though, and it can look ugly.
3D plotting is unfortunately not matplotlib's strong side. I tend to use [mayavi](http://docs.enthought.com/mayavi/mayavi/) for my 3D-plotting, but my plots have so far been static and not animated/updated. This should however be possible.
You don't need it, but it's better to have. And why it's recommended by pypa simplerepo
You can start by identifying a problem from your everyday life. Let's say budgeting - it is very general and applicable to everyone. Start by a simple app that just stores everything in memory. Prompt the user for initial balance, and ask for some expenses to be input. Now, you will be learning about asking for user input, reading that input, parsing it for useful data and performing arithmetic on that data and then spit out a result. It's all cool, but now you want to make it persistent. So, you look into writing the data to a file. For budgeting it is also important to record the income, not just expenses. So, you add transaction types and the logic for it. It's all good, but it's still plain text. It is hard to see what is happening. So, you look into creating graphs, images and collate them to a report. Nice. Look into something like matplotlib, or even simple PIL should do the trick. Now, you wish to categorize the expenses. But you already have a few weeks/days worth of data. Define a few functions to identify each item into a category (groceries, entertainment, rent etc.,). Now repeat the graphs and reports - but based on categories. By this point you will have learnt about file I/O, user input, sanitizing user input, creating images, creating other types of files, and familiarize yourself with how and where to find help when you get stuck. It is not just about being creative, but also about solving problems. Find something that you find tedious and automate it to make it simpler. 
My condolences, if this happened to me (and I'm sure it will someday, just maybe not with JS), I'd be quite embarassed myself.
It's not only still used, it's seen a bit of a resurgence since the addition off [ttk](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tk.html) and properly styled widgets.

Creating a Path object does not automatically create the underlying directories or files. You could create your Paths using your virtual directory, and then write a method that maps the virtual directories to your actual file system directories. You could also define a symbolic link to the directory that contains your files, and then access the files through the link, with no actual copying. This *would* create link objects in your file system though, which you would probably want to delete when your program is finished.
Okay that was some solid ass advise... Definitely something I'll be looking in to doing now!!!
i did again and again - its a shame it became the popular choice, because the badness behind it will take so many more years to even out, a true fix is unthinkable
The problem for me was that the major_version and minor_version returned by the Exchange Server are of 15 and 20 However the minor_version 20 doesn't exists in the version_map of the library. If you want it to work you can hotfix this by setting hardcoded value to not have a key error. The file to modify is located in /usr/local/lib/python3.X/dist-packages/exchangelib/version.py Line 102 I replaced major_version by 15 and minor_version by 1.

How directly do questions on a subject correlate to usage? I'd like to think this means Python3 is being used more today, but honestly I think there are just not a lot of python 2 questions left to ask, is that taken into account?
Might be some truth to that. At least not having to google as much. At my last work I worked with mostly Java. I rarely had to Google anything like I have to do with other languages since the IDE helps so much. You can't do too many "clever" things with it either like with python
I would imagine that there being so much Java legacy code, much of which poorly documented and now being maintained by new people, would actually lead to the opposite situation.
Just add the 'go' tag on the left. You're still going to have trouble finding it on the graph.
or, new people are learning python3 and not python2. 
I listened to this podcast and heard Tomlinson describe how he hoped to see opsdroid used as a platform for a variety of solutions. So, I'm curious if opsdroid could work to solve my knowledge-base problem and serve content. I envision a system which can turn a chat into a new piece of knowledge that you can ask the bot again later. Take extract _context_ from the question-thread and serve answers.
Are you looking for two arrays printed side-by-side?
I've been looking at this course for a very long time, nice to see it recommended so much. Sadly I'm off to a week long vacation next week, and I'm afraid I won't catch up afterwards. How much catching up would I need to do?
Yeah, Data is always open to different interpretation, that's why I say you should take it for what it's worth (i.e make your own conclusions). In my own opinion, the trend lines really must show an marked uptick in Python3 interest, because it's growing both relative to Python2 questions, but also growing over time relative to itself.
If it's all about the quirks, php5 would win.
Go is too basic for anyone to ask questions beyond "Why is this language stuck in 1970?"
Dude calm man.... i literally said it was my first full stack and solo. but yes, Node js was simpler, more stable and faster with socket.io and requests. When pushing load tolerance on python it felt like sitting on glass. Node felt like your older brother was head of the football team and a senior when you were a freshman. I might suck at coding but i'm sharing my perspective
Heh, it'll work but it's horrible. Load the string with Pythons JSON library instead, that'll allow you to pluck out the value you want with a dictionary-style interface. Google "python json.loads example".
SICP is the classic CS text that this class was originally taught from. Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs. It was taught in Scheme rather than Python.
That sounds like an interesting use case which should definitely be possible. You would need to have some sort of backend to store the bits of knowledge and then you could write a skill which stores and indexes a block of text when you tell the bot to do so. You could also structure the command in a way that it's possible to pass a category or other metadata to be used for creating a hierarchy of the information. Another approach would be to hook up the bot to something like Confluence or a mediawiki as the backing store so that you have different ways to interface with thte content.
The python gets hungry and eats you 
On the other hand, it makes commits much cleaner when you have to make a change to one of those params. And no, this is not a sentence. You don't need to read it as such. This is only a list of nearly unrelated things. While there are other bits of code where what you say it's true, there is nothing about a function or a method arguments that would make you read it as an English sentence. In this case you're just listing things that go into one place. This will be closer to listing things to buy when going to the grocery store. Do you put them all in one line or do you separate items into different lines? Milk, Bread, Butter, Tomatoes vs - Milk - Bread - Butter - Tomatoes I, personally, find the second one much easier to navigate. Specially when the items in the list are quite long or have some logic in them like in OP's example. 
Beginners ask more questions than experts. Or, at least, experts know how to find the answers without bugging other people.

I saw that live, honestly one of the coolest most interesting talks I've seen.
Spring boot is great, and I would prefer it over Python for a major piece of enterprise software. Python is great for scripts and the like, but frankly I've always found it lacking once the codebase grows beyond a certain point. My advice is to be more open to it- at worst you have another tool in your belt, at best you find another way of writing software that you enjoy. Good luck either way!
One thing, PEP484.
Well there's type hinting instead :) https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html Descriptors also go a long way.
Never miss an opportunity to shit on PHP. You're my people.
Whit enough work you can make everything as fast as Julia. However, what is the point of python if you have to go though all this trouble? You could just learn C++ instead. Julia gives you simplicity and speed at the same time.
Interesting for sure, thanks for the link!
Attributing to the rise of deep learning, I'd say.
Been using it with React. I agree it has a lot of potential.
it was also my first thought..
Damn this still happens to me sometimes even though it´s been like a year since I did any python coding. Tbh I didnt even remember that it was a python function but reading this made me lol so thanks for sharing 
`pyproject.toml` support is already [merged](https://github.com/pypa/pip/pull/4144) in `pip`, but it will take some years until you can assume users will have at least pip 10.0 installed, which is the first version to support it.
Where do you work if you don't mind sharing? 
PHP 7 is kind of OK.
I would only use this if there are a lot of arguments, though that is usually a code-smell in itself.
At the risk of gathering some flames, Go is not a good language.
Could also be a case of every possible Java question having an answer already, thus new questions get dupe closed.
The "trouble" you have when using numba (i.e. mostly just using the correct decorator on a function) is not at all comparable to the huge effort it requires to learn and write *efficient* C++ code. In my experience, performant multi-threading, vectorization and GPU offloading is very hard to get right in C++ and often requires thousands of lines of hard-to-debug code, whereas numba does all that mostly transparently with only a few lines required (comparable to normal python/numpy code). Julia itself is a nice language, but it also takes significant effort for existent python developers to learn it and integrate it into their code (the latter is often just not possible in restricted environments).

Just the other day I thought I'd try using Powershell to do something basic in windows. Windows scripting has come a long way since the old .bat files day, but after two hours I just gave up and spent 5 minutes doing it in Python. If you've never looked at powershell, check out the comparison operators, it's ridiculous. 
Argh ArcMap is going to use Python 2 until its demise. ArcPro (which I think uses Python 3) isn't gonna be used widespread for another 5 years. Come on ESRI!
Because the idea of competition doesn't apply here. It's literally in the name *Python Packaging* **Authority**! It's the official authority, it's basically the law. You can't compete against the law, you can only try to change it. Your project doesn't do that, or it does it only in a passive way which I think is not the most productive way.
&gt; Doing something new isn't saying that others, that do the same/similar stuff, are doing stuff inadequately, that is just a stupid and desparaging. Except that in this case the *others* are literally the authority, the Python Packaging Authority. Competing against it doesn't make sense. Instead you should try to contribute to it directly.
How does this compare to GitHub?
It's a lot more readable to use `list(reversed(A))` though
Well ok, C++ was a too extreme example, you are right, but there are quite a lot of good fast low level programming languages that are not very hard to learn. So what is the point of python? The typical python argument is a trade off between programming productivity vs speed. But python looses all of it claimed benefits as soon as someone start to care a bit about speed. Numpy is not complicated, but it still sucks that you basically try to avoid using python itself by using such a library. What I just found annoying is that this article is like "look python can just be as fast, Julia is not needed". But what is the solution? Going trough all this trouble just to get what Julia gives for free. Of course if you have a lot of code integrating an other language is always something that you should only do if absolutely necessary. And in this case the trouble in this article is worth it. I just don't like how the article presents it.
Have you looked into Kivy? It won't give a "native desktop" feel, but it's really easy to use.
&gt; Java &gt; Quirks What?
Because Python is the only thing that will last and progress when Java has died off into the world of old maintenance jobs with no real career path. I've felt bad for a few friends who went the Java route and are now struggling in the industry while I've simply progressed due to Python in multiple sectors. One of them has already swapped over to Python and almost doubled his income due to it.
What is the point of the article? The best term I can come up with is "Portfolio stuffing". 
You're going to need a physical manifestation of an x86 computer if you want to use Numpy. NINJA EDIT: or a Python manifestation of an x86 computer atop a bamboo implementation of Python.
If you defined python strictly as only the language itself, without any third-party libraries, then I'd agree that it is too slow for any kind of perfomance-critical computation. IMO using numpy is not "avoiding python itself", but it is using python the right way. One of the main strengths of python is its library ecosystem that enables developers to use it as a glue language for highly efficient implementations of common functions that are written in other languages. There are low-level languages that are quite easy to learn (C, for example?), but I haven't seen one yet that really lets you focus on the problem you try to solve without first wasting your time with the need to re-implement basic data structures from scratch and to write ten times as much code to solve the same task.
It's getting to the point that medium.com should just be a banned domain. It's like 90% spam.
At work, pure MS shop, I did a couple adhoc solutions using Python. Eventually I was asked to use something else in case I need to share my scripts with other people. I have a few years of. NET experience but the Python solution is always so much faster to put together. I figured maybe PowerShell could be closer to Python but turns out that accessing Windows API and COM objects is A LOT simpler in Python. Which I find so weird. 
&gt; so foo_bar_bar_foo_bah_baz_foo() &gt; Is clearly a good name as it passes pep8? Except that's not what we're talking about here. We're talking about indentation of arguments to functions. Which you have 3 PEP8 compatible styles: first: def func(one, two, three, four, five): pass second: def func( one, two, three, four, five ): pass third: def func(one, two, tree four, five): pass and the OP (not me, not you) gets to decide which of the three works for the situation. You have your opinion that you expressed below and I have mine which I have refrained from sharing because it. ain't. my. code.
Whenever I need to write a batch script in Windows, I ask myself if portability is important and whether Python availability will ever be excluded. If the answer is no to either of those, I just do it in Python. So much better. Faster. Easier.
What's a GCSE?
looks interesting
From looking at most of these examples it's clear that Python will be able to perform really well with projects like numba, Cython and PyPy in the picture. My impressions after using Cython are that Cython can for the most part even outperform Julia. Couple that with the fact that with Julia there will probably be a few steps before you squeeze the maximum performance possible of out your algorithm, and it makes Cython a no brainier for a developer that is already using Python. That is until you consider that most of these examples do not showcase (what is in my humble opinion) Julia's true strength - homoiconicity and an opt in extensible type system that is part of the language. It's trivial to make a new Class in Python and set up behavior that one would be interested in. One could easily implement decorators, metaclasses, descriptors, properties and other dunder methods to customize class behavior to the heart's desire. But Cython (as far as I understand) does not support these Python features. If an existing library implements an interface using these Python features, it's not obvious to me how it would be possible to use Cython to improve performance. Julia on the other hand has no such restrictions. I would say it is desired to use macros and metaprogramming in everyday programming. I've been a Python user for over 6 years now. I've only looked at Julia for a few months now and I already can see concepts and ideas in Julia that have no analogue in Python. But most if not all Python programming features translate to Julia one way or the other. I love Python, but I can't help but feel that the lack of a opt in type system and more powerful metaprogramming constructs is hurting it in these comparisons. 
You can add type annotations to Python 3.x and use MyPy to type check. I too like type safety and was thrilled that this was added.

&gt; Eventually I was asked to use something else in case I need to share my scripts with other people. What did you end up using?
I have started my first small web service with Cherrypy and am amazed, how easy it was! The original problem was actually to help someone convert a Latex document to XML, but it was difficult to let them use my script, as they are not familiar with Python (also the script only works from command line). The solution now is to provide a minimalistic web page, which first of all is password protected (to avoid high traffic on my little Raspberry Pi..), and lets you upload a zip file with the contained Latex document(s). After the upload, the files will be unpacked, processed with the converter tool, and then sent back.
On a serious note, does this create any problems, because the hash of the actual integer 314159 is the same?
no, there will always be collisions, this is intended
PyPA calling themselves the Authority came about as an inside joke, and you shouldn't attribute something authoritively to them (or anyone), just because they called themselves an authority (though obviously those guys know their stuff). Basically, especially for documentation, unless you can argue that their project is best on *all* attributes (short, indepth, beginner-friendly, supports power users, specialized topic, etc), other can attempt to improve it along some dimensions. For example: maybe one set of docs is "best" for the advanced user. Then another set of docs can at the same time conceivably be "best" for a more novice user. So, "quality" depends on different attributes, and different approaches may very well improve the overall quality of the eco system. Also, if something isn't good enough, you can trust that it will fall by the side of the road soon enough, so minimal harm will be done. 
Ok if you only use it to glue libraries together then python works good enough, but as soon as you want to write something yourself it sucks terrible.
This got me thinking and I did: hash(float('nan')) which is zero. A quick (though far from exhaustive) playing shows that they work fine together in sets and in dictionaries. I seem to recall (though I will have to find it) that if there is a hash collision, equality is checked, It may be slower though
Oh, also: hash(float('-inf')) # -271828
I've been working on and off (more off than on, lately) on a WordPress-like (but static HTML) blogging system, Mercury: https://github.com/syegulalp/mercury Right now I'm kind of in a mire. It runs, but a lot of the code was written before I had a good grip on what I was doing or what was the best way to accomplish certain things. So right now I'm in a swamp of yak-shaving and tedious picking-apart and fixing-up. The good news is that I have it up and running full-time to deploy two websites with different designs. The bad news is that it took a lot of cadging to get it into that position, so anyone who tries to deploy it on their own is going to run into a lot of problems. (Before anyone asks: I decided to work from an entirely clean slate rather than build a UI for an existing system like Hugo, mostly as a learning experience. That might not have been the best plan, but I can't say I didn't learn a lot.)
i consider tk a legacy module because it just fails at basic unicode beyond ucs-16. if you must use it, be aware that the first exotic user input (european languages will be fine, chinese/japanese/korean will not, neither will be emojis) will break your application. personally, i like using gtk3 instead (but have no experience with windows exes). wxwidgets might be another viable cross-platform toolkit.
Trying to get a job (got a couple of interviews :D ) and trying to make a game. Both seem to be going slowly, but alright. 
How're you making the game -- using an existing framework, from scratch, etc? (also, congrats on the interviews!)
I agree, because i have not yet found anything worth reading, on this site.
Godot Engine, currently with GDScript but probably porting it to Python when Godot 3 comes out, or at least any games I make after that will most likely use Python most of the time. 
I really can't stand Java. I had to learn it (albeit I still wouldn't say I am comfortable with it) for my masters. But as someone who started out with Python and R, I really can't wrap my head around why it has to be so complicated.
This post reads awfully like a rude demand. Besides, the person best suited to finding this resource is you. You haven't even stated which exam board you're on. If you can't find it yourself, ask your teacher.
Which version is that? I get this on python3.5 &gt;&gt;&gt; hash(float('-inf')) -314159

People were asking how many cutouts were in this [paper art post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Art/comments/6uvx6o/biophilia_i_hand_cut_paper_21x30cm/) I wrote a script that counts the cutouts. The script also works for counting the closed shapes on coloring book pages. I made a variety of coloring functions in addition to the random coloring used in this album.

&gt; PyPA calling themselves the Authority came about as an inside joke, and you shouldn't attribute something authoritively to them (or anyone), just because they called themselves an authority (though obviously those guys know their stuff). Joke or not, doesn't matter. They are what they are. They operate and maintain PyPI obviously under the umbrella of the Python Software Foundation. Sure you can publish your Python project in whatever package format you want but that's obviously not feasible. So in cases like this it makes sense to adhere to one single way of doing things (*There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.* .. sounds familiar?). While I do agree with the rest of what you wrote I do not like more or less redundant information spread all over the web written by random people with no review process whatsoever. How in the world do you know whether that's recommended best practice, how up-to-date it is, hell, many bloggers don't even put timestamps on their articles and most of those articles stay published for way longer than they should be while the author doesn't give a damn. So, yes, please do improve documentation but contribute it back to the project it belongs to. (Unless it's one of those "tutorials" that explain how to make several technologies work together (e.g. Docker + Flask + AWS).)
Can someone please explain this? I'm dumb.
Started working on Sunday on a Engineering Dashboard. That Uses python, flask and snmp with some crude javascript and ajax to do live monitoring and reporting on a performance dashboard and gives an idea of the client consumption on our platform. Working very well, very chaffed with myself.
π ≈ 3.14159... and it has an infinite number of decimal places
I'm thinking Z-80.
Meh, first of all, Java is mostly written by "professionals" while Python is the number one language for enthusiasts and scientists and the like, who'll usually not use Java. Professionals will usually have a better understanding on how stuff works, how to debug code and read source. Not to mention be more patient with their code. Also, teams are not replaced all at once, so people will usually ask their teammates before asking questions on StackOverflow. edit: This is not to say people who use Python aren't professionals, just that the demographics are different. Java just isn't "hip" anymore.
I use these scripts for my own convenience. Out of the two I had to share, one was converted to .NET and the other compiled with PyInstaller. The sad side effect is that I don't share as many tools since I'd rather avoid having the conversation of "this is not supported" again. I keep the shortcuts to myself :-(
That makes sense. Thanks
Shouldn't the float of infinity be infinitely large not infinitely long? doesn't a floating point number have a fixed precision? why wouldn't you use the highest numeral of the base system to the maximum number of significant digits able to be stored?
bro... not the right way to get people to want help you.
Okay floating but constant number of significant digits? 
The hash in Python is just some integer which each object has, such that objects with the same value always have the same hash. It’s used for instance in sets (to quickly check for equality). Sometimes there are hash collisions, which can’t be avoided, where two different objects have the same hash. Infinity has got to have *some* hash, so someone who made this probably thought it would be funny to use 314159
Thank you! That makes sense
Basic makes things fast. It's C with multithreading and networking support, and garbage collection. A lot of programmers are allergic to slow, even if their application is not CPU bound.
&gt;The sad side effect is that I don't share as many tools since I'd rather avoid having the conversation of "this is not supported" again. I keep the shortcuts to myself :-( I think Pyinstaller would be a good way to handle it. 
Just half way through.. some articles are really good!
I work with Java every day and hate it. What a terrible sewer of a language. Everything sucks and it never gets better in the right ways. I've done a little bit of Python and found it very enjoyable. This is good news.
1. You never define `heck` or `no` 2. /r/learnpython
Yeah, I agree. I worded it poorly, I thought Java activity on SO should be *increasing* as new people take over, not necessarily that Java people ask more questions than Python people.
&gt; i literally said it was my first full stack and solo. But you had to convert py module to node. If you learned, power to you! &gt; Node js was simpler, more stable and faster with socket.io and requests. But did you try to use python with zeromq, pika, mqtt? &gt; Node felt like your older brother was head of the football team and a senior Nodejs or the v8 interpreter was designed and driven by the need for google to have the fastest and most advance javascript engine for strategic advantages. After a couple of secret years in the making it came out of nowhere and blew the competition out of the water. But now you have to add the js spaghetti ecosystem which is node/npm; when last did you try to restore a old node project? &gt; I might suck at coding but i'm sharing my perspective Thanks for sharing and no one said you suck at coding!
hmm. You're right. On 3.6, I also get -314159 but on 2.7, I get what -271828 (I do nearly 100% of my coding in a way that works on both, but 2.7 is still my default...not by choice)
&gt; if there is a hash collision, equality is checked [Actually, equality is always checked.](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Objects/dictobject.c#L697) First by identity (using the convenient fact that `id(o)` is the memory address of the object), then with `PyObject_RichCompareBool`. You need the equality check to know if there's been a collision in the first place. :P

Post history checks out. You can't even be arsed to tell us your exam board. You come across as incredibly entitled. A useful skill is the ability to search things online. Believe it or not, you are in a better position to know what kind of coursework you need to do than the largely American and post-education people here, so stop expecting to be spoon-fed, and search for it yourself. If you still have trouble, then come back (or, better, go to /r/learnPython) and ask again, people will be happy to help if you have at least made an effort to do it yourself first.
TIL. Thanks!
They told me you could do *anything*. They told me my *imagination* was the limit.
I have not even heard of those three modules and in all my googling. I will go look them up. yes it took me two solid 10 hour sessions to figure out what NPM was doing. There are three environments by default. It was maddening. And no, i literally forced myself to learn it since friday. The module export function is still kind of dicey to me. I honestly was having issues with socket.io and autobahn on python.It took me around 16 hours to learn it in python (asyncio, autobahn, and websocket-client) and some of it was still a mystery. When i ramped up the volume it started having inconsistent errors. So i figured out how to do some error handling based on the providers dataset. once that was stable it started having local errors that had me troubleshooting in the layers of python libraries. After that, I said let me try node. Once i figured out the NPM situation, it took 20 minutes to figure out socket.io and autobahn. It worked liked it was supposed to immediately. I didn't have to make 3-4 encoding conversions it just worked.
I've been working on a distribuited file system made in Python, very (**very, very, very**) semplified version of HDFS. I've already wrote the code for data storage nodes and now I'm working on "control" logic server scripts. Communication between data nodes, control nodes and clients will be entirely based on Http(s) (using Flask and requests). I'm crazy, I know lol
Yeah, README's are just files with some basic info, so in this case setup. They shouldn't run things and should either be markdown or just plain text. 
Google, although I'm not a senior engineer.
Thanks for the quick reply and clarification.
[here's an example](https://github.com/laike9m/pdir2) Note how the readme contains instructions on how to start the tests. Less obvious, but repo also contains a `setup.py` which is a file that pip uses. This means that you can download the repo and use pip to install it. [more info](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/distributing-packages/#initial-files). 
Author of the original article here. Glad this was revisited!!
That. Also machine learning.
Thanks for your help!
This is probably due to its extensive use in Data Science. 
If the codebase is well tested and the programmers had a strong sense of separation of concerns and building good APIs, a big python codebase can be much nicer to mess with as far as I've seen. What sorts of shortcomings have you seen? I'm assuming it's around developers treating parts of the codebase as a script dump 
Is it possible that you misread *numba* and replaced it with *numpy*? I agree that using numpy is an inconvenience at best. But *numba* allows you to write plain Python code and have it run at C speeds. It seems like the future.
I'm not surprised, python has a lot of media presence, specially when every single question asking "Most beginner friendly language" ends with python in one of the results. I also noticed when I do code wars or hackerrank I see a lot of people showing off their one liner code with python, beginners doesn't see much depth in all these language yet, they notice cleanliness and simpleness which python excels. For that reason alone I love python. For other newbies looking at these comments EdX.org's 6.00.1x foundation CS with python is going to start, you guys should sign up and try it. 
Well yeah it's entirely possible that i'm fucking it up. If someone wants to help me I'm game, but quite frankly I've been unable to solve the issues with quite a good amount of research and the research indicates that i have a legitimate problem. 
Ah interesting. Being in the northwest, I have a lot of friends both in tech and aerospace. We all self-identify as Engineers, just different disciplines. Software engineering is engineering, etc. The EEs, MEs etc can't code for shit 😈
I started with cx_Freeze but docopt+PyInstaller have been god send. For one tool I wrote a very quick Tkinter UI. I didn't share it but tested it with PyInstaller and it also handles that very well.

This is my biggest pet peeve about being currently stuck on a project that requires Python 2.6 compatibility. If I could just have type hinting, I think I would enjoy working in Python much more.

QT QT QT QT QT QT QT QT QT QT QT QT QT PyQt5, not 4. Not only does it make desktop GUIs wicked easy to build, especially with it's Designer, but if you want to port it to mobile, it's not all that difficult. Seriously, dump Tk. 
I declared a simple function for multiplication table and as parameter I put (nb,max=20) nb its for number that u enter. The function works when I try no error. So I just registered this function wrote on IDLE and named it "Table" (its not an important thing i think) and I added ".py" so the computer will understand to run it with python. Then I open another IDLE and tap : " import Table" And I also tried : " from Table import* " But it just told me that the function doesn't exist so what did I do wrong ? And sorry for not being precise the first time. Ps: I registered Table.py on my desk dunno if it affects my problem
Maybe, but what I wrote is still extremely common, and it's slice syntax...everyone in Python knows it.
Holy shit could you pass me the savefile for the 217 kills one? That's crazy!

You can thank the rise of data science for a large portion of that increase.
For read-only access, Reddit has a json-based API which works by appending ".json" to the end of any reddit url. The `requests` module can get that and parse it into a dictionary for you. The only catch is you have to supply a non-default user-agent. url = 'https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/new.json' # the newest posts from /r/Python data = requests.get(url, headers={'user-agent':'scraper by /u/yukineismybae'}).json() Now you can extract the posts and upvote counts and do whatever you were planning on doing with this data. --- If you have more questions like this it's better to post them on /r/learnpython. Be sure to [format your code for reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/faq#wiki_how_do_i_format_code.3F) or use a site like pastebin. Also, include which version of python and what OS you are using. 
Yes I did. Looks interesting, I will check it out. Thanks.
And now ppl will ask... so where's the script?? Nice work.
&gt; We all self-identify as Engineers, just different disciplines. Software engineering is engineering I think the issue is that many people "self-identify" as a "Software Engineer" but they don't have a degree in Software Engineering. In Canada, at least, there are professional associations of engineering that require you to have an accredited engineering degree to use the title "Engineer" and there are legal ramifications if you misrepresent yourself as an "Engineer" when not recognized by that professional association as such. Not sure if it's the same in the US but I think that's maybe part of what /u/billsil is referring too. So it's less about self titles and more about legal titles me thinks :).
Ahh, should I delete this post and repost in /r/learnpython then? Also, thank you for the help!

i appreciate it. more concerned about knowledge sharing than karma but the sentiment transfers. 
It's working!
I'm sure you're right there, but it's of course easier said than done. And I think the bigger issue was cleanup- any codebase in any language can accumulate technical debt, but I find It easier to clean up and refactor a Java codebase than a Python one simply because of the incredible tooling available around Java. The other major issue I've dealt with is dependency management. I standalone binary is easiest, but a even deploying a JAR or WAR is easier than dealing with pip and proxies and everything else on production servers. I'm sure there are solutions to these problems, but while I know mvn and other aspects of the Java ecosystem will be around forever, I can't be so sure for any Python tooling.
This is so simple, but can you explain how it's working? I get the first two lines, but why do you do. r.json()[0]['price_usd']) ?? I can see the element is extracted like a dictionary, but what does the 0 do.
consuming web services not hosting a web server though urllib get api functions fail after a certain amount of activity websockets-client has erratic behavior that triggers socket closer cassandra driver can't manage more than 10 db sessions redis driver has a bottleneck with DB select 
Umm... so I think their message "Can you provide a readme to run the tests and also a package manager such as pip." Should really read: Can you provide a README documenting how to run the tests and also make the package installable with pip. 
That would make much more sense I think. I will do that, so that means making a setup.py? Cool chance to learn something new.
Look at the received JSON. It's a list with one element, and that element is a dictionary.
Ok, here is where I got stucked. So I went doing all over again using your logic and this is the code: with open(fileName) as file: lines_after_2 = file.readlines()[2:] for line in lines_after_2: if line.find('G') &gt; 0: objects = line.split() del objects[1] objects_list.append(objects) objects_list.sort() for objekt in objects[1:]: grid[objekt] = grid.get(objekt, {}) elif len(line) &lt;= 15: time_stamp = line.split() time_stamp_list.append(time_stamp[0]) else: for col, g_val in enumerate(objects_list): grid[g_val][time_stamp_list] = line[col] I will leave you links with pictures if you don't mind: http://imgur.com/42LEFxn -- so here is my grid and my list of g values. http://imgur.com/JTNPNMA -- here are the sequances of the ditto lines. http://imgur.com/VsWBUHX -- this is the error I got when I tried using your line of code in the else statement. I don't know why is that or what is wrong. As I said, I don't have much knowladge of python or programming in general, still learning, so don't laugh if you see something stupid in my code xD Feel free to answer if you have will for it, but you already helped me a lot, so thank you once again.
Ok now that makes sense, I guess I just don't understand JSON.
Where we agree: Full Stack should certainly include system level considerations and the ability architect a distributed system. Where we disagree: Data engineering and data science are a very different skill set from Full Stack. The latter grew out of website development. The former is entirely built out of scientific computing. And this is where you see the growth in Python today with the Continuum Analytics suite: anaconda, numba, numpy, dask, pandas, etc.
This made me think of the computer made of people in [The Three Body Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Three-Body_Problem). A cool read. I need to look up the others, now that they have been translated.

Yeah, I know it's a great suite, but there is something about the answer "oh - there is a spring blah blah blah for that" really crushes my morale. I feel reduced to being a code monkey and if Spring doesn't already solve the problem, I feel that I would be hamstrung in trying to solve the problem myself.
honestly, TKinter isn't that bad. it's not a super complicated toolkit so for complex UI it's a little rough. 
What typeface is that?
You can hash an infinite number of things. There are a finite number of hashes. Therefore, collisions are unavoidable, but (hopefully) no hash is any more likely than any other, outside of the distribution of things you tend to hash. So in these cases where the developer needs to explicitly set the hash, so long as developers setting hashes for different things don't all choose the same hash, there is no right (or wrong) answer.
&gt; Software engineering is engineering, Not at all in the same way. It's system architecture and optimization, not engineering method development. Engineering is much more math heavy. I didn't even go that high in math (I just have a master's) and I have 3.5 years of college+ level math classes under my belt. &gt; The EEs, MEs etc can't code for shit Not out of the box, but you teach them. That's why we go for senior engineers with a coding background. I'm not a coder, I'm an engineer that codes. The CS people that we hire have a habit of just throwing numbers into the box instead of thinking about the problem from a physical perspective. It's really useful in regards to testing robustness, but solving the sane problem not so much. I've tried teaching them FEA and it's a waste of time. Give them a problem like optimize this or solve this sparse matrix really fast and they can do it no problem. Ask them to validate the results and again, it's a very tough task.
An infinite loop with a sleep() to not hammer the server needlessly would work, although it's not very elegant. Maybe use cron on Linux or a scheduled task on Windows, and save the result in a sqlite database, or a simple text file.

100% this, thinking that python is more popular than java in the corporate world, is a pipe dream, it's not. It's just a beginners language that get's googled a lot. like really a lot.

I'm of the strongly held belief that if you still think something is great or perfect it's only becuase either; that thing is trivial, or you don't know that thing well enough. So, I always ask "What is the worst thing(s) about Python?" "GIL" is, sadyly, typical response. That answer combined with their inability to articulate how/why/when it is a problem reveals how little they understand about Python the language vs a Python implementation, processing model, I/O, scaling, blocking and host of other things. It quickly separates the people who know shit from the people who just regurgitate shit they read on reddit/stackoverflow.
Python for hipsters and java for professionals? I dont get where you get that from. I have never seen any numbers on that. The python guys i have worked with have all been very professional. And have many times outbid and made better code than the "java enterprise" guys we competed with. 
one of the few useful bots on reddit.
I think the author destiles the wrong conclusion! He blames the tool of being too good, easy to work with and abstracting things on a very high level so he has often not learned about the insides of the problem domain. This is not the fault of python, as this would have appeared in **any** other language around there too! If it is your task too play an Mp3 file, you should consider using an existing library. This is true for any language. The library will hide all the internal stuff from you with good intentions, because you simply want to use it. You should be able to use it, even if you know nothing about how Mp3 en-/decoding works! If your task is to write a Mp3 encoder,you have to understand the domain and how the algorithm works. This is true for python and any other language! So in reality you only learn about things, if one is interested within the domain. This is totally independent from the language. 
Virtualenv is slightly different in that you can have a Python 2.7 virtualenv and Python 3.6 virtualenv at the same time. Numpy is 2 orders of magnitude faster on Windows (not sure about Linux, pretty sure that's not the case for Mac). Installing packages is way, way easier, but no, it's exactly the same thing other than some very nice features that are mainly external to Python.
It taught me pretty well man, 2.7 or 3 its a language that can be used to make life easier. 
But so does 1/3. :-)
If you can justify [The Case Against Python 3 (For Now)](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/nopython3.html) please go ahead. I'm still of the opinion that Shaw needs shooting.

Yes! Do yourself a favour and check it out. I swear by it (but am open to changing my mind.)

A git installation is only required in order to calculate the version, for packaging. Every developer will have git installed, right? The user doesn't need git installed in order to do a `pip install yourpackage` or `python setup.py install`.
 OP answered you already wrt hashes, but was lacking some direct answers &gt;Shouldn't the float of infinity be infinitely large not infinitely long? [No.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754-1985#Positive_and_negative_infinity) &gt;doesn't a floating point number have a fixed precision? [No. (assuming "precision" meant "relative precision")](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754-1985#Range_and_precision) &gt;why wouldn't you use the highest numeral of the base system to the maximum number of significant digits able to be stored? [That's pretty much how it works (wrt the bits of the mantissa)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754-1985#Examples) 
Nitpicking bitches are the best. 
Good points, thanks for elaborating. What kind of tooling helps with refactoring in java? 
A hash function is supposed to have a very low chance of collisions.
It's amazing how US-centred this post is. It's not until the mention of "Manhattan" that I realised this was advertising a position in the US. I mean, it's not like Soho there is a famous Soho outside of New York, or there is more than one currency in the world. But oh well…
Yes, but it's fine if those collisions are easy to find *in particular cases*, as long as they don't come up often in practice. Of course, the above isn't true for *cryptographic hash functions*, but it's fine that not all hash functions are cryptographic hash functions.
You are complete correct in your statement. I fixed things on the post and I am sorry about that!
The purpose of that particular hash function in python is to distribute things around a dictionary efficiently (as needed), collisions are fine it just means they end up in the same bin in the dictionary. Two values which are equal should have the same hash() but two values with the same hash() are only potentially equal and python uses this to intelligently move things around into bins for fast lookup to get a good chance of not ending up with overly large bins unevenly.
 I would like to take part in the project. Any help would be appreciated :)
Being able to read CPython source.
Interesting. Odd characters would be a part of this. Could you point me to an example of input that Tkinter couldn't handle?
You convinced me. I was unaware of ttk. :)

I did more reading and if anyone should find this after me: Same question with good discussion: https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/2m282m/tkinter_still_relevant/ I'm going to make some attempts in Tkinter and wxwidgets and see what sticks. I have zero windows experience and all I know is that everything is harder for those folks. Keeping dependencies down is primarily for their benefit. PyQT and GTK are out (sadly) because of their large dependencies. I'm hesitant to try Kivy because I'd like the UI to be as stable as possible and it seems very new. 
There is a difference between a rational number's repeated decimals and irrational numbers'. *Roughly* speaking, a rational number is one that can be represented as `a/b`. (**EDIT:** Where `a` and `b` are integers and `b` is not zero) 0.33333333333... can be represented as 1/3 π ≈ 3.14159... cannot be! Furthermore, you can pretty simply prove that 0.333333333... is equal to 1/3 and on the flip side, you can prove that pi is irrational. 
Then what else? I'd say Python packaging, setuptools, code distribution. Despite much love recently this is still a topic devs avoid because it's so confusing.

`hash()` is somewhat deceptively named. `hash()` is used in conjunction with `==` or `__eq__()` when two different objects present the same `hash()` value. `hash()` isn't actually a cryptographic hash; it's just "a moderately unique integer".
That makes sense then, thanks.
If you expect signals, like Control-C, to be delivered you should arrange for a thread to handle them, likely by `join`ing with each thread and then exiting. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18499497/how-to-process-sigterm-signal-gracefully

Ok. Quite a lot to work through there ;-) First off, rather than posting pictures of stuff on imgur, use a pastebin service, or if it's small enough, paste the text straight into reddit like you did with your code - it's much easier to read that way. Unfortunately you missed off the actual error message from the else statement, so I'm not sure what's wrong. The line after the one with the "^" is the one that tells you. Can you put a `print(grid[g_val],line[col])` statement in before the assignment to show what's in there first? Happy to keep helping ;-) "There are no stupid questions"!
I still use Perl (because of its ubiquity on Linux systems) when needed. But Python is becoming more and more available. I don't like Python (and other interpreted languages) where I don't want others to see or modify my code. I have the same problem with Perl - I'd write code and then give it to someone to use, they'd make changes without telling me - and then I'd spend a lot of time figuring out what the heck was going on. I wrote a stub that checks the checksum of my Perl Code prior to execution. If the checksum doesn't match, it aborts. Alas, it does not prevent someone from running the code outside of the stub. :-( If I were to ever ship commercial code written in Python, I'd have the same concern in addition to perhaps protecting my intellectual property. 
I am using quite a lot of Fortran for my work, mostly because it is (on of) the de facto standard(s) in HPC and computational physics. Also, my simulation code is robust, well tested, and is written in Fortran. I know it sounds like re-stating the obvious, but sometimes, *you really do need the speed*. I'm doing simulations that regularly burn more than 100 000 CPU hours to complete, that typically produce up to a few TB of data. That's the kind of case where it starts to matter in which order you do the loops, and where you want to control finely how much data you exchange between cores via MPI. Then, of course, most of the analysis is done with Python (with the heavy lifting still done in C/Fortran, but anyway).
314159 is not a particularly common number. 3.14159 may be, but there are not a lot of places where you'd need the integer, non-floating-point approximation of 100,000 pi. Anyway, the python hash() function is not really intended to be used for different data types, so unless you're doing something fairly funky a float and an integer having the same hash() isn't going to result in a collision in a practical sense anyway. Generally when you're hashing stuff into a dict or whatever, you're going to be using all floats, or all integers, not a mix of the two. 
I use C#, because it's strong typed.

What errors?
&gt; A git installation is only required in order to calculate the version, for packaging. For the code I posted and scm, yes. &gt; Every developer will have git installed, right? The serious ones yes. For the people new to git, they're editing through github (or whatever), so it doesn't really matter. &gt; The user doesn't need git installed in order to do a pip install yourpackage or python setup.py install. True, but it's one more dependency that I prefer to avoid. It increases the downloads, increases the chance for API changes, etc. I looked at scm, it basically does the same thing with a lot more code (even on just the git part).

I think codecademy still uses python2. If you downloaded python3 then the code won't work on your computer. Post on /r/learnpython with your code and the error you are getting and they will help you from there. Be sure to [format your code for reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/faq#wiki_how_do_i_format_code.3F) or use a site like pastebin. Also, include which version of python and what OS you are using. If codecademy isn't your cup of tea we have [a pretty long list of learning resources in the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/index#wiki_new_to_programming.3F) that you could try.

The print is Python 2 syntax. In Python 3 the print must use brackets like print(). I recommend if you're new to Python just to learn Python 3 instead. The Python you installed is Python 3 btw.
&gt; homoiconicity What does this mean?
Putting a float into a hash is asking for trouble because you’re bound to get little rounding errors and issues with -0.0 anyway. In general, you don’t want to test floats for equality but being closer than some arbitrarily small difference, but a hash works on equality, so you can’t do that. 
If only Python devs would release 2.7.18 as the last supported Python 2. 
Right now i use python when it's my stuff or noone will need to maintain it after me because i really like it. I have old code in vb.net that i maintain from time to time. Also i have people who need code which i deliver in php because it's our shared language. Then there are web pages that need javascript. Used to use adobe aem so needed to know a bit of java.
Top choice, a real prime number.
Downvoted for the uninformative title. Start with the official Python tutorial on http://www.python.org
Javascript. Because I hate myself.
Yes.
Try it somewhere else. I was doing codecademy and wasn't learning anything. Try automate the boring stuff with python, or some others out there. I am further along and much happier after starting on automate the boring stuff. Free website with videos and the book. Plus, it's python 3, and python 2 will not be supported past 2020, if I am not mistaken. Someone can call me bad names if I got that date wrong. 
Short answer: Yes. What you're talking about is called Software architecture which refers to the structural choices you make when writing your code. The architecture you decide on, can have a huge impact on the development process of your software, some architecture's make it easier to create scale-able applications, others make it easier to write and implement new features where some might just make it easier to read and grasp. Tons of resources are available to learn about this topic, however python specific is not something i have a link for, since software architecture often is quite theoretical when read about, and how to use it in practice will have to be learnt by doing. TL;DR There are many, this is a field called software architecture.

&gt; Yes, but it's fine if those collisions are easy to find in particular cases, as long as they don't come up often in practice. That still doesn't make collisions intended, just inevitable.
Thanks. I was wondering what the hell the hash function was actually doing. It really is an easter egg, not a real result. (Or I guess special case at least.)
And javascript is next!
Why not use version control?
It’s integration with windows is also great. And then there’s LINQ. 
Yes, but other cryptographic hash functions has the same inevitable collisions, but they're "hidden" much better. This isn't important for all purposes though, as in some cases "easy to find" collisions don't matter as long as they don't occur often (especially on "typical" data). I'd argue the collisions (not "theoretical existence of any", but "relatively easy to find") are a conscious choice at that point. The point of OP wasn't "`hash(x)` in Python has a collision", but that it has a collision on some *less random looking* input, which isn't really an issue by itself.
Right, and what are the chances that you end up with both Infinity and 314159 in your hash table?
I wonder if you could sum infinity if it would give -1/12
&gt; a rational number is one that can be represented as a/b Where `a` and `b` are integers.
Can I request a change to the license? Its confusing when I'm not sure if the license is actually to be followed or not, I can make an educated guess (with the "official" setup.py example, its more akin to being the "one" way to represent that information, so copyright might not apply on the structure of the file, for example) But with the educated guess for this repo, I see an intentionally? invalid? (I'm not sure of either of those!) license, so what does that mean? does that license get followed, does it default to github's baseline permission grants? All I can know for sure is that it wouldn't default to something permissive (to the point of not requiring to give you attribution at least!, since IMO attributing a setup.py template (or a makefile template, or any such thing) seems a bit silly! but you might intend to require attribution, but again its hard to know! I could throw that into a github issue if you want?
Yep, Visual Effects. We use it in almost every program, at this point. It's also a good time to get into it because various companies are trying to switch old tools from Qt4 to Qt5 and also there's the Python 2-to-3 migration coming in the next couple years. There's lots of pipeline work needed in VFX right now
the repo itself is just for copypasta, no need for a license. It provides no functionality. 
if you work for an org that will blackduck flag this then, well, they can send me a check and i'll give them whatever license they want :)
books don't provide functionality either, but they are still protected by copyright laws!
Could I simplify it for now and pass it through the second line like this: for comment in r.subreddit('testsubreddit').comments(limit=10): # the name of the subreddit goes on this line. if ("ain't", "aint") in comment.body and comment.id not in comments_replied_to and comment.author != r.user.me(): 
i disagree that books don't provide functionality :) In either case, this repo is not licensed at the moment, no. If it will be, I'll add it to the README. It doesn't seem necessary to me at this moment though. Not everything needs to be open sourced. 
Oops. One of those thing I know but forgot to include

Yes, pretty much always even for something seemingly trivial. or trivial things there is usually only one good way, but once the program gets even a tiny bit complicated there will likely even be multiple good ways. Things like what to include in what function, what to include in what module, how to lay out subclasses, whether to use anonymous functions or full functions, etc

As much as everyone shits on eclipse, it's got just about every refactoring tool you'd need. Moving files in the package explorer will update references in your entire project, fantastic autocomplete features make it so you almost never have to reference library docs to find the method you're looking for, tools to highlight blocks of code and automatically move it out to a separate method, getter/setter generation, and im sure there are plenty of others that just aren't part of my daily use. Most of my python development is done in sublime text with no add ons or the Python eclipse plugin(my job is 80/20 java/python), so I can't really speak to how it compares to a full featured python IDE, but when working on large code bases, Java and the supported tooling around it are super productive. Yeah JVM is a memory hog sometimes, but it also allows for real parallelism and, particularly in Java 8, has some really convenient features for easily making operations run in parallel. I love Python, and it's my go-to for a lot of things, but Java is also a really powerful language with an impressive ecosystem of tools and libraries that make developing software very productive. There's a reason (besides aggressive marketing by Sun back in the day) that Java is still the main development language for many enterprises. 
Instagram runs entirely on python and serves a billion daily active users or something ridiculous like that ( though I believe they are also using Cython to compile some modules to C for performance improvements). If you like python but are running in to performance bottlenecks, I'd suggest that you - Do performance analysis on longer running parts of your software(use profiling tools too to help identify these areas) and make sure your algorithms aren't needlessly inefficient - look in to using Cython to compile performance-critical parts of your code to C to squeeze the most performance out of it In general, one of the biggest wins with python for me was development speed and maintenance. I haven't used Node enough to make claims about how much better/worse it is for server side development, but compared to other languages I use, python lets me get something up and working very quickly and then I can make performance enhancements later down the road if I find performance to be an issue.
yeah python allowed me to get much more into programming than i ever had before. thank you for the suggestions, i will look them and hopefully have success. 
I don't think anything like this exists as a standalone tool, I think he means to just do what he says: 1. strip anything that starts with a # and runs to a newline. 2. strip anything that is between two single quotes, two double quotes, or multiline blocks surrounded by triple quotes (single or double). This could get complicated due to string concatenation rules. 3. Lowercase the result. 4. Wordcloud the result of that using whatever generator you prefer. You probably could use **ast** to do some of the first two parts automagically. 
Hi all, I have created a small python program which checks a gmail account every so often to see if there is a new email via IMAP. It will then forward it to a SMS forwarding service via SMTP. I have encountered several problems along the way during my testing phase for a month or so. IMAP and SMTP doesn't always work, connecting to the server is not really consistent and this is a problem. I get a feeling that my IP address is being blocked and unblocked by google?if that is even possible. The other problem that I encounter is with the time.sleep, it will eventually get stuck and will not resume with the loop that it came from. With my code attached, it gets stuck/hang with the 20th out of 60 retries for my readMail retry function. If you can also point out the obvious corrections that I need to make or improvements in my code, I would greatly appreciate it. As this is my first attempt to building any code or program as my background is engineering, please pardon my obvious mistakes. Thanks!

&gt; On the other hand, it makes commits much cleaner when you have to make a change to one of those params. Commit diffs are read once, code is read multiple times, so I don't think this is a big factor. &gt; there is nothing about a function or a method arguments that would make you read it as an English sentence. if not self.contains_vertex(x, y, z) self.add_vertex(x, y, z) There is subject, verb and all kinds of decorations ;-) on both lines. In fact, one of the greatest allures of python is that you can write very human friendly code.. Anyway would you really prefer: if not self.contains_vertex( x, y, z ): self.add_vertex( x, y, z, ) ???? &gt; Specially when the items in the list are quite long or have some logic in them like in OP's example. absolutely, if there is any kind of per-parameter logic, one-line per parameter makes a lot of sense. I'll adjust my original post.. And, I can definitely think of situations where an analogy with lists would render one-param-per-line more readable, but, there is no way, this is a good style in general.. (and, yes, different contexts call for different styles: "foolish consistency, etc")

Dash is promising. 
First, because there is no "maximum number of significant digits able to be stored" since Python 3.0. See [this SO thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7604966/maximum-and-minimum-values-for-ints) for discussion. Second, because there is a huge difference between "The biggest number storable in a given system" and "The biggest (pseudo-)number ever". Infinity is, by definition, higher than all finite numbers. Except maybe for some other infinities, but AFAIK there is only one infinity in Python's standard library. The highest storable would be lower than itself +1, which, while not storable in the same datatype, is a perfectly valid finite number. Do you really want "int infinity" which is lower than a whole lot of finite longints? That'll make comparison of different numeric datatypes a complete mess. Third, it'd create a weird edge case. There would be no way to tell whether the variable with eg 2^63-1 in it is meant as the actual number that comes before 2^63, or as an infinity. **EDIT**: This is all true for high-level language like python, which has its numeric datatypes containing infinities and other things that are not, strictly speaking, numeric. Lower-level languages do use high and/or low numbers to represent inf, -inf and NaN, see /u/YouCantMissTheBear link below.
I wanted to learn C# because I'm a business major and businesses like C# because they love Microsoft. So I've been writing a video game using Unity to learn the language, which I thought would take me a month and is probably over a year in the making now. I *enjoy* more theoretically sound languages like Haskell and Rust. They're certainly fun to write in. But nothing quite beats the simple ease of use and familiarity with Python. C# bothers me in all sorts of ways, and idiomatic Python is not nearly as functional as I'd like it to be. But it does the job without much pain.
Eclipse is a good tool, and I haven't really had any problems with it. You should check out pycharm though when you get a chance, it also does all those things and a few extras. My fav is the live debugger where the values appear next to the functions (VStudio also has that) and the very pretty diff tool
Why does Java suck? What specific issues did you have with it? I am going to get a bit deeper into it and invest time so I am interested. 
Lua for embedded scripts in a node graph where it's cheap to have several lua interpreters to allow simultaneously processing data which Python is too heavy to do. C++ and c# for games and high performance 3d processing where pythons lack of proper multi threading and it's relatively slow interpreter put it out of the equation. Then Java, etc for Android dev
Sounds kinda ridiculous as you answer to a question that implies you allready use a strong typed language: Python! Imho you don't really know what you are talking about - that implies the real benefits of **strong** vs **weak** typing. I would suggest, that you put some effort in studying the different aspects of typing and their *advantages* / *disadvantages*. Then you will soon arrive at the topic of *static* vs *dynamic* typing 😉 (which is probably the aspect you wanted to emphasize!)
It is so *great* that MS is trying hard to *remove* this entanglement... they promote their .NET Core approach so aggressively that it feels like they have panic and fear because of this *reputation* of their ecosystems. These days a deep integration into a specific OS is considered more harmful than useful. Something most devs have appreciated since long time ago - now this wisdom is arrived at the management layer. Finally - but too late for some big players? 
Nice. =) Do you want to try adding this feature to [Enforce](https://github.com/RussBaz/enforce) ? The very first issue I got (and still open) is just about this. https://github.com/RussBaz/enforce/issues/1

I hate js. Dash looks incredible tho!
Structue? Even if you're limiting the question to just Python, and just a program that uses a single function to write a single word to screen, there's at least half a dozen ways to *structure* it.
As a sort of first pass through the language CodeAcademy isn't bad, but it really needs to be updated for 3. Unfortunately when it came out 3 hadn't quite hit the critical mass yet.

Catching exceptions is important. Handling all possible errors is a was to solve vulnerabilities in your code which makes it a bit better. There are errors that hide within your code and harm it. Thinking of all possibilities helps keeping your code safe from them. There are also tools who help detecting error and exception might be thrown, such as checkmarx and there are others. Make sure to find all possible errors in your code to make is the best it can be.
I'm aware of it. The thing is that I don't know what causes the exception. What's even more weird is that I tried to run the example code that pyOSC provides and it pops the same exception. 
Hey, so here are some stuff I saved and 2 timelapses: [4 saved critters](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B0kcD6OsZeUFazJXa1NTZXF2cGc) [Timelapse 1:](https://streamable.com/74ypw) Sim had been running for a long time, I gave a big burst of energy and then pulled it back instantly. Watch the ensuing feeding frenzy and then relaxation back to "equilibrium" (it never truly equilibriates by nature). [Timelapse 2:](https://streamable.com/fpdc5) A continuation of the last sim (though at some point in the night the last sim went extinct since I starved them, so I repopulated with some of the best critters). The energy is quite limited here. They survive well for quite a long time. Towards the end you will see that only one niche is actually filled. When I woke up in the morning this sim had gone extinct. I think they went extinct a few minutes after the end of this timelapse, but I can't be certain. &gt; different intelligence models...neural networks That would be pretty cool actually and it would be a natural way to see which fairs better. If the NN are just superior, you'll know pretty soon. ----------------- PS. I added some motion blur in the timelapse to make it easier to track the critters. Also thought a re-colour might help track too, but I don't know, that might've been a waste of rendering power. 
Also, use the modern string formatting. print(f"Let's not go to {string_1}. 'Tis a silly {string_2}.")
Bash ... people keep forgetting it's a language, but if you're on Linux or Mac, it's ubiquitous and ludicrously handy. HTML / CSS / XML / TOML / YAML / Markdown ... funny how many languages we forget are languages are out there. Tcl ... cause it's still the underlying core of Nuke, and I still get asked to automate Nuke a lot. C ... mainly to read, not to write, but I often need to know precisely what a Python extension is doing. Seeing how easily it can go ludicrously and dangerously wrong has always kept me away from actually writing it much. When I have time I explore Go, Rust, Sass, TypeScript and Elm, but the one I am seriously trying to put time into is Haskell, because it seems to go the furthest to making the ideas behind all the others make sense.
I dont really care mate
in connection to the two answers that already exist: if you're a cs major, then it will be worth it to buy in now to the school's preferred version, bc later on, the package management might come up. if you're just taking an intro course, don't bother if you already have the python.org version bc you won't encounter any difference in operation. 
It should have been 42.
I use R sometimes because some statistical analyses are not implemented in Python's stats ecosystem.
It's fine; hash congruity does not imply equality. &gt; `help(hash)`: Two objects that compare equal must also have the same hash value, but the reverse is not necessarily true. In fact, as hash() always returns an integer value, and is identity on integer values, `hash(hash(x)) == hash(x)` should always be true - `math.inf` is no special case in that respect. Edit: Just noticed this isn't strictly true - on the system I just tested, hash('a') = -7038216387426171974 and hash(hash('a')) = -120687359785090121. However, it's idempotent after that, and I suspect it always takes very few iterations to get to that point. Edit: Apparently, the range for which hash is idempotent is [-2^61 +2, 2^61 -2], (absolute value 0x1ffffffffffffffe), outside of that it wraps around. Since the hash values themselves can be up to 2^63, a lot of hashes will be outside that range, but quickly fall inside it on repeated application.
Why did you think it funny? It's simply an human error. All you should do is just to report to Amazon.

Hi, I was wondering if you could help me a little further... So I have created a setup.py and I have uploaded it [here](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/boggle2/0.1). I'm just unsure what this is meant to do. So if the user uses pip install boggle2 What's next? The user doesn't need to download my code from github, it should now be on their machine and they can run my code?

The VS2017 python tools are pretty good, so if you are happy with that then don't feel obliged to change - you can find a workflow that works for you. They have added nice tools for interactive computing (https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/pythonengineering/2017/03/22/interactive-windows-in-vs-2017/) If you really want something that works like Matlab then Spyder was specifically designed to work in a similar way. For scientific work, Jupyer Notebooks are great but are quite a shift in work style compared to matlab. Personally I use PyCharm IDE (free community version, pro version free for students) to write 'module' code and Jupyter to do analysis and visualisation. You will find a lot of examples and tutorials in Python built around Notebooks so they are worth learning about.
spyder for a similar IDE. Jupyter notebook because it's love. Pycharm/sublime/other for real packaging.
Since PyQt5 now comes as a wheel with the Qt libs included I think installing it on Windows should be painless. Do you know of some issues? I'm curious because I'm about to start a new project and PyQt5 seemed a good choice for a cross-platform GUI toolkit.
I hit some limitations lately: - I wanted to ship an executable, and it was a web app - I find deployment too complicated - I'd like more expressivity in the language (pipes, pattern matching, globally more meta-programmation) - more type checking - and, of course, I'm in search of the best solution© to write web apps in the same language So I'm heavily investigating [Common Lisp](http://lisp-lang.org/) and also [Nim](https://nim-lang.org/) (its [karax](https://github.com/pragmagic/karax) web framework looks very promising).

I've been sketching out the project requirements, and collecting possible solution research. I'm at that spot when I need wrap my head around the multiple constraints on the project--speed to prototype, immediately available content, maintainability, and suitability to my work-group. opsdroid sounds fun and engaging. And MediaWiki is on my radar as a good direction for the content storage. Its encouraging to hear my project might be a fit for opsdroid.
Hi! Dash is really amazing you have done a great job! I wrote dash.app to visual some data from my sql server and have some trouble. when app starting i got data from server and all works fine. How can i update dataset for graphs by updating web-page without restarting app? how to do it in best way in case of multiple users of dash app? 
&gt; *Roughly* speaking, a rational number is one that can be represented as `a/b`. Why roughly? If `a` and `b` are integers then this is definitional. (Edit: and `b≠0`)

Very interesting - anyone know why it works this way?
I wouldnt have though of calling ffmpeg through sys-argument. Smart to use outside tool, rather than trying to implement video encoding in python. (I have no idea how to do it, so it seems like a quick fix)
I tried to encode with python add got into a right fuss with it. Basically ended up creating massive files and codec issues. So just ran the ffmpeg instead as a quick in and out job. With a bit more finesse could have a little wrapper to be able to send arguements if needed though. 
&gt; `hash(hash(x)) == hash(x)` should always be true No. It may be true for some `x`, but that is an implementation detail. `hash()` is not required to behave this way.

Linux processes have a maximum stack size, the kernel kills them if they use more. You can set (and see it) using `ulimit -s`[1]. So if your limit is currently 8192 (KBytes), you can issue a `ulimit -s 16384`, and if you run your program now, you will get roughly the double amount of recursion before a segfault. --- [1] You can use `ulimit -a` to see all limits.
You described a problem and answered it your self, what are you asking? also use /r/learnpython
I don't understand what you're trying to say. Care to elaborate?
&gt; Now 36132 seems to be pretty close to 2^15 It's 3000+ greater than 2^(15). Unless a number is 2^(n) or 2^(n)-1, it's probably random (wrt powers of two). &gt; ((36131 * 136) + (36131 * 72 * 3)) / 1024 / 1024 ~= 12mb The math is pretty fuzzy here. It's closer to 13MB, so again this just seems like some random number. Anyway, for me, in py2 this segfaults at 20153 calls, and in py3 it segfaults at 33812 calls. It seems like the author is trying to draw conclusions based on some faulty assumptions/incomplete data.
Roughly speaking nothing, a rational number is one that can be defined as a the ratio of two ***integers***. In addition, it's not like the proof that pi is irrational is as straightforward as you're implying. I recognize that your response to this should be "ugh, you know what I meant", but this is a programming subreddit, and you're talking about math. You should take a little more care with your wording.
damnit
You're on the right track, for sure. A code sample of what you've tried will help people know the best way to help, and as /u/maxibabyx mentioned, /r/learnpython is probably the best place. You'll have a more active audience there. edit: happy to help you out. send me what you've tried so far.
Step 1 would be to make Python run at an acceptable speed in WebAssembly. [PyPy.js](http://pypyjs.org/) is a step in the right direction, but not finished or stable. Step 2 would be to provide some sort of hooks to interact with the DOM from inside PyPy.js, and make them fast enough. Step 3 is to port Arcade to use browser APIs through those hooks, instead of relying on native libraries.
Yeah, Fortran is pretty common in nuclear afaict, as well as utility sector
&gt; a recursion depth that is set sanely &gt; Conclusively, I suspect it is not possible to have infinite recursion in Python either because our call stack will grow too fast or we simply allocate too much memory. And now we come to my biggest criticism of Python - it keeps newbies complacent in their insufficient understanding of basic concepts (AKA - what was hip in the 70s): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail_call All this because the newbie-in-chief can't be bothered to learn functional programming...

Um, not to dissuade from what seems like a nice little bit of work, but what exactly is the elevator pitch for Janus vs **getopt**, **optparse**, **argparse**, **docopt**, click**, or **prompt_toolkit**? The first three are built in with no dependencies, the second two at least seem to handle all the main cases you describe at a quick glance, and while the last three add an external dependency, and **click** and **prompt_toolkit** are far from lightweight, they all offer good pathways to elegant (and in the case of the last one ludicrously interactive and colorful) command line tools, with helpers for autocompletion etc. Like I said not trying to dissuade anyone and it looks relatively simple, nice website, etc ... but after looking for a few minutes I don't see what it gains me over the builtins and don't see that it gains me as much as the non builtins. So what's the winning features argument?
&gt; equality is always checked. First by identity Note that in the post you're replying to `float('nan')` is mentioned, where `id(x) == id(y)` doesn't imply `x == y`.
`hash(-1) == hash(-2)` Go ahead, try it
After reading some of the posts here this feels a bit lame. I'm just starting out, working my way through No Starch's Python Crash Course. This week I'm working on implementing the Fifteen Squares game. 
Aggreed on supporting the author 
Just because TCE isn't a design goal in Python doesn't mean it's trying to hide it from people or keep them complacent. The biggest opposition to tce in Python is the preservation of stack trace frames, you can't unwind a stack you've squashed. And TCE only helps when the only thing happening at the end of a function is a recursive call and maybe a return. While it'd help here, most people don't seem to get that. Other languages (for example Java, c#) don't support tce. 
Thanks for the courteous reply! I may have solved this using a 'continue' statement to continue the list parsing while keeping track of matches. I will post in /r/learnpython per your suggestion.
This is too simple..like a high school project 
"Can't be bothered" is not the impression I got from Guido's [post](http://neopythonic.blogspot.com/2009/04/tail-recursion-elimination.html) discussing the decision. He decided that it's more important to have the full call stack available so that when you print a stack trace, it tells you everything about how you got to the point of the exception.
Woah
Like I said in the original message, yeah I could use ast. Was just wondering if someone had already done it. If I were to do it in ast, I'd probably make a subclassed NodeVistor that just stores the FunctionDef ClassDef MethodDef and names of things and tokenizes the strings into parts.
Golang for semi lower-ish level stuff, C++ for math related stuff. JS for the UI server.
What your question? 
In C#'s case there's no technical reason why not, though. The underlying runtime supports it. F# for example runs on the same runtime and makes use of tail calls elimination.
Scala and Kotlin both do as well and they're on the JVM (though my understanding is that scala has limited support and needs an annotation to help it, not sure about Kotlin). In these cases, I'd imagine it's the compiler doing tce rather than the runtime though by converting the recursion into a loop. 
Sorry, didn't see (still don't see) a mention of **ast**, but yeah that's pretty much what I was thinking, plus maybe discard a bunch of obvious boilerplate (standard import statements without **as** can probably can be skipped, the `if __name__` guard, etc.) to cut down on the chaff. Definitely sounds like an interesting view on things.
Tried connecting using the following code con = pyodbc.connect('Trusted_Connection=yes', driver = '{SQLOLEDB}',server = ‘SQL-PROD ‘, database = ‘HISTORY') Then my query. I cannot compile the script. What should I be doing? 
In the real world, no matter how much we try, we can't always enforce strict versioning. A script, that works fine on one system, may need a simple tweak on another (e.g. if the version of Perl or Python is slightly different) and admins will work to get it deployed. Sometimes their tweaks make it back to the CVS repository, but they do get missed. It happens a lot in a heterogeneous environments.
We do. But even if people forget to merge back their changes 1% of the time, we will see variations from the main branch that will proliferate. That's reality. Especially in heterogeneous environments - something as simple as two different releases of RHEL will do it.
Apparently the commit message before squash was "Help, I'm stuck in a universe factory!".
Haven't we seen this article before?
Sounds like you have a bigger problem of either not having a configuration management plan or people not following it. Switching to Python to get around it isn’t going to help. Eventually someone will come along that knows Python or learns Python and you’ll be in the same problem again. 
I made a quick and dirty version using the `tokenize`module: https://gist.github.com/dzamlo/ec5ab24bcce52d02fc455993a91cfb0d
How do you debug your c extensions? I’ve got a legacy code base that’s being used and I’m getting a signal 11 failure every so often. Still trying to trace it down. 
Yes, maybe less that a week ago.
Nah, in the CLR's case there's runtime-level support for it in the Intermediate Language: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.reflection.emit.opcodes.tailcall(v=vs.110).aspx That's part of the reason it's so irritating the C# doesn't support it :)
&gt; He decided that it's more important to have the full call stack available so that when you print a stack trace, it tells you everything about how you got to the point of the exception. Again, a choice that favours the perpetual newbies - the ones that already know loops so they won't bother with proper recursion. Lua got this one right: http://www.lua.org/pil/6.3.html If the actual purpose were to maintain the default stack tracing behaviour, the solution would be as simple as making TCO an opt-in, with some function decorator or some other ugliness. There are simply no technical reasons why Python is so primitive. It's all politics and posturing.
I tend to agree but note that **optparse** is deprecated.
Yep, my bad: https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/6vbby4/reducing_pythons_startup_time/
Maybe I'm misunderstanding, but are you trying to do something like: for i in range(len(json_input['Items'])): json_input['Items'][i] == comparison_set
Huh, go figure. I'm just getting started with C#, but learning weird stuff about it an the time. Like you can't yield in a try catch, which was my first instinct in handling a particular problem (turns out that wasn't even close to the right thing, but that's besides the point) 
True, though hilariously getopt is not deprecated, but also hasn't seen a non-spelling mistake commit in &gt; 3 years, while optparse has continued to see commits post-deprecation. I'm not suggesting using **optparse**, just asking what this offers that differentiates it.
I wish I could say I've found a better process than just walking through it mentally by reading the source after I've just used PyCharm and a breakpoint to discover what was being handed off at the interface to the extension, but that's all I've done, and thus far it's come up rarely enough that's all I've needed to do.
Still an interesting read the second time around.
What is Dash? Can't find anything on Google. 
"I could write it myself using ast but I figured I'd ask, first." ;). Good idea, I hadn't thought about guards and import aliasing. If I make my own solution, I'll add that, for sure
What sites are you scraping and do they have IDP? Would you mind sharing the scripts?
ML is difficult in a hackathon because of the amount of data and time you need to train. Make me a personal assistant the size of a small tablet with voice and face recognition, build a simple chat bot, attach some hardware. I want to open my medicine cabinet, have it recognize who I am and remind me to take whatever medicine I need for the day. Bonus points for dispensing pills from a piece of hardware, and if I ask for more tell me whether or when I can take more. Personal pharmacist.
Use python to do facial recognition. Have a camera, and the laptop screen. Show the face and a count of times a particular face has looked into the camera, for a simplest use. It'd be cool to use it as an auth mechanism, but i'm not sure if thats viable, plus you'd need to auth into something then.
Oh, yup, there it is right there. This is why I like to bold **modules** I think!
You've basically shown them in a dictionary in your question, so use two of those, one for buyers and one for sellers where the price is the key and the number of people the value. Then you can filter the dictionaries for key lower/ higher than the price, sum the values left and take the minimum of the two results.
Do you have any good resources for any of this? For instance, I've never actually encountered a time when I've needed to use `__new__` and I don't think that I've seen it in real use in code anywhere else. But I know that it *can* be used... I'm just curious about something that explains why you would want to use it, what are the trade-offs vs. some other approach that would also do the same thing.
Also if you're an Electrical Engineer or Mechanical Engineer and by negligence you build a bridge that falls down, or design a circuit that burns a house down you can totally be liable for that stuff. Most of us break things more often than that, some of us in rather expensive ways.
I want to check if I am getting it right. Perhaps not. There are 1200 buyers and 1100 sellers total. So if I input 13 13 into the program (buy and sell) I should get ~~600~~ 800 buyers and 700 sellers. So total share movement is 100. if I were to put 15 (buy) and 15 sell then I have 1100 sellers and 100 buyers. So share movement is 100 too. However if buy is 11 and sell is 15 then nothing moves. is this what is supposed to happen? 
Objective c, microcontrollers
You should get 800 Buyers for a buy price of 13, and 600 Sellers for Sell price for 13, it's basically less than or equal to for buys and greater than or equal to for Sellers. The rationale being, if you would buy a share for 13$, you would also be willing to pay 12$ for the same share. Likewise, if you would sell a share for 15$, you would also be willing to sell it at 16$.
"Ain't" is perfectly fine colloquial English. Please don't actually deploy such a bot. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_prescription
**Linguistic prescription** Linguistic prescription (or prescriptivism) is the practice of promoting one kind of language use over another. It may imply that some usages are incorrect, improper, illogical, lack communicative effect, or are of low aesthetic value. Sometimes informed by linguistic purism, these normative practices may address such linguistic aspects as spelling, grammar, semantics, pronunciation, and syntax.

I was using it more so for as an example
I think it's more confusing because there's a lot of information out there and not all of it is good information. And most people don't really understand how the things work, either.
Okay thanks for the explanation. Is it not possible to create two dictionaries buyer and seller with key =price and value =number. Then for a given buy sell input just sort the dictionary by key value and add the relevant numbers. 
Well, now that looks like a question with a certain amount of built in bias.
I would run down the buy list and find the total buyers: 1200 people willing to buy at 11. Then I would iterate back up the sell price keeping track of the number of people willing to buy and the number willing to sell, so something like this: total_buy = 1200 total_sell = 0 best_sales = 0 for price in (11, 12, 13, 14, 15): total_sell += sellers[price] best_sales = max(best_sales, min(total_buy, total_sell)) if total_sell &gt; total_buy: break total_buy -= buyers[price] return best_sales 
If ur asking for the function I have no commenter, it runs perfectly and gaves me for instance the table of 5 
Have you tried the pymssql library? Maybe that would be nicer to use than pyodbc. 
:( I put myself as a python developer, and i hadn't encounter coroutines until this week...
Fair enough, but "use coroutines as part of their main **flaws**"??
Yea I know, I was putting pictures because the files are huge and I kinda wanted to show as much as possible, but, it is a bit harder to read and understand that way, I agree on that. I can't print that because the error is on the lines that should put something inside grid.

However, Go does fit a niche that Python was often used to fill, things that need reasonable performance but aren't as heavy-duty as OSes or embedded software or graphics programs. In particular, I've seen it used for a lot of middle-layer stuff, like webservers, which before were primarily either written in C (with lots of memory bugs) or Python (slow). The way it statically links everything together to create a single binary is pretty nice for distributing tools, too.
I've got Go on my horizon because it's establishing its niche in SRE tooling, in places where there wasn't a great tool for the job before and so often Python was used. But in a more general sense I don't see Go replacing Python.
I came up with a one liner for each "shares_sold" and "shared_ought" functions (I made them as lambdas). My solution included: sum(), a list comprehension and dictionary.iteritems(). 
Ahh, fair enough. Looked like a wee bit of a troll. Well there's the sort of granddaddy of async, [twisted](https://github.com/twisted/twisted), which uses **async def** if you're running a recent version of Python. I don't know it, but [Sanic](https://github.com/channelcat/sanic) certainly seems to have gotten a high number of stars. I first heard about coroutines maybe four years ago, but they didn't really start to take off and have stable utility until 3.5 and 3.6.
More "pythonic" for i, item in enumerate(json_input['Items']): if item != comparison_set[i]: print("Difference found!") break else: print("No differences found") 
In Matlab, everything is a matrix including strings. There is no non-matrix primitive like in every other language. A matrix data type should not be standard. There is too much active work to stop supporting old versions of python, which would happen if numpy were builtin. The devs don't want it to be builtin. That would lock down the API and as a library author, numpy or scipy changes almost every major version in super edge case ways. That would not be allowed. I'm an aerospace engineer and use numpy almost everyday. It's wonderfully design. Sympy on the other hand is slow, like all symbolic approaches. It should not form the foundation of any code you write.
I was able to find [this paper](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2833162&amp;dl=ACM&amp;coll=DL) (pay-walled, sadly), that could have some useful info(currently at home so I can't tell you what's actually in it). There is also [this article](http://numba.pydata.org/numba-doc/0.34.0/developer/architecture.html) from their official docs that describes the compiler architecture.
Anything that uses async/await is using coroutines. Before async/await keywords using coroutines through yield and .next() was not very popular or ergonomic.
Normally a setup.py specifies some combination of modules, packages and executables to be installed on the machine. You can then import the modules or packages or run the executables regardless of your path and without any need for them to run your code. pypi maintains a list of packages that pip installs from. setup.py provides commands to upload packages to pypi. Alternatively pip can be pointed directly at github. &gt; What's next? Submit your code? I generally try to let people install my code and get a working example running in less than five minutes through the readme. 
I don't see what the 136 byte and 72 byte compiled function sizes have to do with the size of each stack frame. To be clear, each time you call the function, you'll have local state which is stored in a stack frame. I see it as ~380 bytes: In: [ sys.getsizeof(x) for x in sys._current_frames().values() ] Out: [380, 360, 344, 376, 352] Separately just b/c the byte-compiled python is 380 bytes doesn't mean that there's not more overhead in the C-layer (which would use more memory again). Are you doing this in 32bit or 64bit python? 
Of course not, as the ranges outside of +-2^61 indicate. But I doubt you'll find any implementations that go out of their way to avoid it happening at all; it's not a cryptographic hash, so letting it return the input for integers is probably the fastest option.
