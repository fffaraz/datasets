You mean loading up IDLE and then running the code from there? Most of the time people just run a script at the command line using `python script.py` or similar, so they have access to the code but aren't confronted with it. You can go through steps to obscure the code but it's not foolproof as far as I understand.
Logic is a fundamental aspect of programming, and I wonder why you don't use it to assess the flaws in your reasoning. You are assuming quite a few things in order to confirm what you already believe, generating a comment full of hate which you just vomit onto other people. I don't think anyone needs that. **Next time, think twice before commenting.**
Yeah, except next level is when you don't have to explain it
was just an example, but i'm taking my above script for zfs snapshots and doing the same for lxc snapshots, the logic is bit different. my datastructure is container_name-&gt;array of snapshot names
My assumptions are that an average human, by age 16, should be able to program something as simple as this with less than half a year of instruction. Please tell me why this is wrong because right now I'm really unable to understand how classrooms full of students were unable to write code this complex after an entire SIX MONTHS of instruction. How can you possibly fill SIX MONTHS of lessons with material and not cover 1) if else 2) loops.
The article just demonstrates it is slow in that scenario and then follows up with a multiprocessing solution. It looks like a good article.
This can be a huge can of worms to explain. I'm going to over simplify things. I'll only talk about the reference implementation of Python called CPython (written in C/C++). CPython takes your code, compiles it into byte code (think pseudo assembly), and passes that to the interpreter which translates it into machine code on the fly. Cobbling Python code into something that will "just run" involves some tricks and more or less copying the entire interpreter with byte compiled and correctly linked libraries and code into a platform dependent executable package. It's a pain in the ass. Luckily there are some Python libraries to streamline that whole process. Pyinstaller is one I've used a bit and it's not entirely terrible. There are some caveats and gotchas to using it so reading the documentation is crucial. In short yes you can do it. Should you do it? Probably not but fuck it no one's going to stop you. That's some real Pythonic shit right there.
This is a problem. I work in a team of developers and currently have to update some projects from a former developer at our company and its a pain in the ass. Variables and comments are a mix of bad English and bad German. The rest of the code is barely understandable without many hours of getting to know the project and it is not possible for me to meet the deadlines if I have to work with his code, while it is perfectly manageable with the code of my mentor. So I try to write my code at least as readable and elegant as his projects. This is not at all possible, if I want to match my deadlines also, so I just don't try to do so, cause the boss always just guesses the time and the takes it minus another week without him having experience for years now and in full knowledge that all developers still have other projects to do. This leads to projects that ship a month later than the client wants, but at least you can work with them afterwards, as most of them are long term projects or the customer wants to do something with the code. We try to move on to better code style in general, but without the time to even test properly it's really hard to do so.
I've never thought of it like that. I'll keep that idea in mind then for way in the future lol.
My objective would be to find out what is the best way to build a channel, and create content.
LXC has some sort of command line flag to display all the info as simple key-value pairs that you can parse way easier. Look into that.
I think /r/learnpython would be a better place to ask questions such as this.

Places I work at, and feedback I've gotten from friends in the IT world have shown me, that this is one of the biggest reasons we think twice before hiring a freelance for a job. Past experience has shown that their code generally looks horrible. You could say "rushed" most of the time. More often than not, the application gets delivered, the freelance is paid, leaves and not very long after, the application is scrapped in favor of an in-house developed solution. This usually happens as soon as major maintenance is needed (new bigger features, critical bug discovered, deployment on new architecture and so on). At that point it often becomes apparent how unmaintainable the code is. All this could be avoided by having good code-reviews, or a better vetting of hired freelancers. Unfortunately the vetting is not always easy, especially if they don't have a public portfolio like a github account (NDAs are often an issue). And code-reviews are also hard as time is not always made available for that. Which is part of the reason why freelancers are hired in the first place. For all these reasons I really don't care if the deadline is missed by a certain degree as long as the code comes out clean. A little more time spent on making the code maintainable is WAAAAAYYYY cheaper than rewriting all from scratch. If I see a freelancer writing code that reeks of a "but it works" mentality, you can be certain that that freelancer will not get a recommendation from me.
I'm a python learner, and real noob, and I wish there was a place you could just go and ask a stupid question and get an instant answer because sometimes the link to another similar question is really hard to understand. I get that duplication is a waste of everyones time and a nuisance for good/advancer coders - but when you've been searching/reading on how to do something for like 4 days and can't solve the problem. Has there ever been a sticked mega thread for bad coding questions? or anything like that... it would help a lot of people starting out.

done, thanks
Two things, in Python there's a community accepted standard PEP8 that sets some rules on how to format code and name variables. You should try to get used to the easy ones (like how to name variables), but not worry to much about spacing and stuff. For those, there's black, with will format your code to look more professional, so you don't have to. &amp;#x200B; [https://github.com/ambv/black](https://github.com/ambv/black) &amp;#x200B; Get it, and instantly your code looks like other people's code...
Regex?
Well done
 with plt.xkcd(): plt.plot(plotDate, plotAmt) plt.grid(which='both', axis='y') plt.tick_params(axis='x', which='major', labelsize=11, rotation=90) plt.tight_layout() plt.annotate('Loads of quakes!', xy=(5, 400), arrowprops=dict(arrowstyle='-|&gt;'), xytext=(8, 450)) plt.ylim(0, 500) plt.show() This is code I used for my graph on earthquakes to space out the x-axis ticks. The two lines in particular that you can try are the ones below. Changing the labelsize helps prevent overlap, and rotating them 90 degrees makes them take less space along the X-axis. plt.tick_params(axis='x', which='major', labelsize=11, rotation=90) plt.tight_layout() &amp;#x200B;

Thanks. The other problem is that columns does not appear at positions of exact labels. When you look at last X labels it suggests tahat they do not have any value. But they do and I have no idea why it's not showing. I also don't get why columns at CÓ and DA are overlapping. I guess there is too much date to show and I can't get it under control.

Yeah, Con-currency, the new Bitcoin...
Since you have such a large amount of ticks on the x-axis I would suggest splitting your data in half and showing it in two separate graphs. Not sure what you are using the data for (presentations? just personal to get an overview?) so not sure how feasible a split solution would be for you. I would at least try to make it into 2 graphs, where one goes from AD to NO, and the second graph handles the rest of them. Then you can place one graph at top and the other below to show both graphs in a more readable format. An example here: [https://matplotlib.org/gallery/subplots\_axes\_and\_figures/subplot.html](https://matplotlib.org/gallery/subplots_axes_and_figures/subplot.html)
Thank you, I think I'll do that. I'm using this data for an assigment at university, that's all.
This is normal I guess. I’m a software engineer for almost 10 years now and I have this feeling almost everyday haha
It doesn't hurt if you know that there is one-line functions (yeah, they are more than that but to put it simply), you don't need to learn to use them.
Matplotlib also have some good features for annotating data and such as well. Might be worth looking into if you want to give your graphs a bit more flair. E.g. highlighting the top or lowest values and such. Some more examples on how to textualize your graph: [https://matplotlib.org/api/\_as\_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.text.html](https://matplotlib.org/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.text.html) &amp;#x200B; Good luck with the assignment. Hope it goes well!
Nope but it's easy to convert lists and tuples into sets just do set(list_or_tuple_object). And like /u/theotherraf said, you have more operations: `&amp;`, `|`, `-` and `^`. I have found `-` to be the most useful to me.
Short answer: Yes, you can compile Python into an .exe for someone to run like a “normal” program.
You won't get better teachers with the same shit pay, especially in a field like programming where there is a lot of demand for talent.

To clarify, I have no problem with threads, I just don't like it when multiple things are all run in the same thread via. registering callbacks whenever waiting for something to happen, which is what asynchronous programming is in this context.
Feel free to make some posts about your success stories teaching kids coding, sharing your techniques and any helpful tips you have!
I tried it. It was able to unwrap the exe but during the de compiling I am stuck in "magic value mismatch". As said in that tutorial I opened two pyc files and pasted the missing magic number. I think this is the [missing magic number](https://imgur.com/a/ljxLWL8) &amp;#x200B; Is it because I am using auto-py-to-exe and not 'py2exe'? or am I doing something wrong?
That's an awesome effort for such a brief period of learn-work! I *highly* recommend reposting to r/learnpython, subscribing, and living there for as long as you want/need to learn or help others learn. It's an exceptional community, brimming with legitimate experts who love to help. No question is too dumb or simple!
That is the beauty of python, its really like Lego. Happy building!
You probably don't need to paste in the magic number, your files should be normal .pyc files.
Doing that also says "Magic Value mismatch"
What version of Python are your applications built with?
Python 3.7.1
Then you might want to try using [uncompyle6](https://pypi.org/project/uncompyle6/) directly, the version shipped with Easy Python Decompiler might be too old.
Nope I am getting [this error](https://imgur.com/a/46XOrmt)

On the same website : other tools for developers from PortableApps and PortApps.
What's the version of `xdis` that you have installed?
3.5.5 &amp;#x200B;
Try upgrading it to the latest version.
"uncompyle6" only runs with xdis 3.5.5. "The 'xdis&lt;3.6.0,&gt;=3.5.5' distribution was not found and is required by uncompyle6" &amp;#x200B; I checked the version log of xdis after 3.5.5 they have 3.6.0 which isn't compatible with uncompyle
Your version of uncompyle6 is outdated too then.
Difference between: x = "World" print("Hello {}".format(x)) # and print("Hello {x}")
I didn't really have an idea how many would be interested, in the end 7000+ downloaded the free copy And many generous people paid for it. I live in outskirts of a city in India, so dollar conversion and relatively cheap living means roughly I've been paid a month's living expenses
good job!!
I think you can use matplot lib and just continuously update each coordinates position. As to how that can be done, no idea but my guess is a loop on the update coordinate command. Might need to checkout their docs
Yep
if you had asked me a few months back, I would have said no now, I am willing to give video courses a shot, may be start with free recordings, get feedback and see how it goes..
There is nothing to be gained by starting out with "I am a High School dropout and I have no degree." It does not make your code better, and no one is going to forgive lapses in your coding, commenting, or logic because of your education.
Your error message is unreadable. Also, as far as ai know uncompyle only works on pycs, so you need to extract them from the exe first.
I think that `while text is None:` is more idiomatic than `while not text` but other than that - looks good 😊
I am aware of string methods like split, startswith, partition, etc but I am so used to regex that I'm likely to use them even if not needed I would definitely like to see non-regex solutions - both to expand my knowledge and to offer the alternatives to those who struggle with regex If possible, could you work on [Exercises](https://github.com/learnbyexample/py_regular_expressions/blob/master/exercises/Exercises.md) for this book and share the solutions with the community?
Thanks so much for the reply,but the indentation is correct in the script but not here.
Throughout my whole experience programming (5/6 years) I can still remember one of my largest hurdles was writing my first app/script. It took me much longer than one month, I almost quit three times over a period of 2 or 3 months, but once I finally was successful/ it ran, for the most part things got easier. Congratulations on writing your first script - you have already surpassed many that have came before you and unfortunately failed. I hope you further development this skill and it serves you well in the future 😊 
&gt;your book is simple and really helpful Thanks, that's the kind of feedback that would help me to continue writing If you do feel some section is not explained well, please do let me know so that I can work on improving :)

I posted the error message [again here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/ag7g7c/convert_exe_back_to_py/ee46upm/)
That does not seem correct. Are you sure you've extracted the files properly and haven't modified them?
Yeah, After extracting the exe using " PyInstallerExtractor" I did not make any changes for the first file. As said in the previous comment I added a magic number to the second one
You might need to use [this](https://github.com/countercept/python-exe-unpacker/blob/master/python_exe_unpack.py) then.
regex doesn't really work here or is over complicating the problem. you still have a single string which contains all of the text you need to parse through (or even a file) even with a regex you'd have to go line by line to find what you want , capture it, then stop capturing an unknown amount of lines.

But I want Python and its community to die a painful death. What am I to do?
Threads all run on the same core (and yes, it's related to the GIL). If you want to run on multiple cores, you can use the multiprocessing library, which is discussed toward the end of the article.
Lol, no it isn't. But there's a lot of garbage that survives even longer. Take for instance, Python. Or Base64 encoding of emails. Or unprotected memory mode. Or JavaScript. Or C++. Or Java. In fact, when it comes to programming, popularity and ability to survive seem to be inversely proportional to quality.
It was an intro to programming course using Python. 
Hey, the cyber omelette is my blog! Really glad you found that post interesting. I've been thinking about better animations too actually, especially after seeing [this guys visualization](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/9oqlvl/i_made_this_with_python_so_proud/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link). It would be really cool to have a nice animation to go along with this instead of some barebones 80s graphs. It's way on my backburner for now, but if you get it going please shoot me a message. I'll probably try to peer pressure you into a [git pull request](https://github.com/benrules2/nbody/tree/master/Python_Orbits) too though, so don't say I didn't warn you. 
Did you read the 2 items called 'read this first' on this [page](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/rel_1_2/)? there's also an overview link on that same page. 
So we moved from C like formated printed to something that's templatized?
I figured I would make it easier to read as I learn more and more Python. Also, one of my friend who is a FrontEnd developer told me she wanted to make the app as a small side project. So I think I have no choice but to make more pretty.
That's so cool! The blog is incredible. I'll definitely let you know if I get something started, though no promises :D. 
What did you run? Just a trace back on a code I’ve never seen crash is tricky. I’ve seen it produce bad code, but never crease. Makes me think you have bad input like a whole exe.
It really depends. I would like to say "yes", but as with most things in life, it's not quite that simple. At a more granular level, I would say definitely, yes. Once you break down a problem or algorithm into its component parts, and with each of those parts you are unable to succinctly describe what several lines of code are doing in that component, your code isn't clear enough. But on a broader scope, i.e., with respect to an entire system, a small piece of code might have a much larger and more complex implication beyond it's local scope. Generally with object-oriented design one tries to avoid this, but in some cases it is unavoidable.
The game?
I surely did. At least I tried. Imagine that you are a network engineer with not a lot of background in programming. I learned the basics in university but that was all. I needed to learn programming because of the new devops.REST API, infrastructure as code and automation paradigm that is storming my world these days. They say use Python, it is easy. And it is. Or it was till I run into SQLALchemy :-) Now having the above said read this While there is overlap among the usage patterns of the ORM and the Expression Language, the similarities are more superficial than they may at first appear. One approaches the structure and content of data from the perspective of a user-defined domain model which is transparently persisted and refreshed from its underlying storage model. The other approaches it from the perspective of literal schema and SQL expression representations which are explicitly composed into messages consumed individually by the database. I don't think that the author ever heard of Feynman. 
Just parking here for future references 
Thank you, Do you have a hard time teaching HS students how to code? Do they feel it's important they learn (some) coding? &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
I honestly thought I was a genius since I thought I was the only 40+ who was trying to learn Python. But now I think I am only a bit above average, so thank you. &amp;#x200B;
Full disclosure: I'm not currently teaching, having relocated to a different state last summer. Some of the students were excited to be in class, while some of them were just not interested in the other options offered. The toughest part of it was keeping the excited ones engaged while not losing the others. One school in which I taught had no electives - Python was the first, so some students were excited to have a choice, with no real interest. They weren't running towards Python, they were running away from another year of French. In the other school, Python was offered along with other CTE electives (photography, culinary arts, auto shop, etc.), so I got a better mix of students who were interested in tech. 
I'm almost two decades older than you and I've only been learning python for less than two years, so believe me you have plenty of time to become an expert :) Keep doing what you're doing and you'll be fine. 
Sorry, but this is not the place to post such a question. Try on a dedicated QA forum like StackOverflow.com
I read somewhere once where an experienced programmer said he didn't measure his productivity in terms of lines of code he wrote since when he took over a project he ended up removing more lines of code than he wrote. Thought it was an interesting take. Other piece is learn to abstract your problem away.... but don't attract too much because you went down some software design pattern rabbit hole. Those patterns are extremely useful and important but what's more important is knowing when to ignore them. Google "enterprise FizzBuzz."
They almost invented YAML. What a shame... But maybe it's one of those YAML-like formats nobody cares about, and just maybe they have a formal spec, or, even better a parser for this kind of format? But, my gut says they didn't and there isn't, and there won't be.

Doesn't DBus provide some kind of XML-soap thing for this? I would suspect that even if it does, parsing it would be more heavy-weight and slow, but, in principle, it's the thing that should do this kind of thing.
Thank you for this, I will analyze all of it's content. &amp;#x200B; [Me right now](https://media.giphy.com/media/KxhIhXaAmjOVy/giphy.gif) &amp;#x200B;
not sure I understand your point. you clearly have a grasp on what sqla is. it's an orm(unit of work pattern/session) built on top of a query dsl. you can use both or either. What are you trying to do with it that you can't figure out how to do?
Wow this is very impressive. What was your method for learning Python?
Yeah I got that as I read on. I was reading the top section and was like wait a second. But GIL in Python. 
Good going, I am totally new too Python as well and having fun creating and troubleshooting code. I will check out your resources as obviously they have done you well. I have only watched the first 5 videos from csdojo, but loving Python so far. Keep up the good work! 👍
C-like format strings, i.e. `'Hello, %s' % ('world!',)` haven't really been mainstream for a while because of the often-misused calling conventions (the part after the `%` should be a tuple, but many people didn't realize this, and the language was sometimes lenient enough to let it slide). The `str#format` instance method has been preferred for a while because it doesn't leave room for ambiguous syntax. You call it like a regular instance method, which requires parens, and everything in the parens is necessarily an argument tuple. A nice side-effect was that `str#format
Being French Canadian, this hurts a little... Why would you not want to learn French? &amp;#x200B;
Well i belive Your main problem is understanding what ORM stands for. I believe one of the best described ORM usage with examples is in... Django Official Docs (not SQLAlchemy though, but there are many similarities when using Active Record pattern). Try to read and understand this: [https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/topics/db/](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/topics/db/) In short - ORM is "higher" abstraction layer than "direct" querying to database. For example You are not using "SELECT \* FROM posts" and retrive list of "some data", but You are using ORM eg. (active record, with model Post) pseudocode: Post.get\_posts() (it will produce "SELECT \* FROM posts" in "background") and in return You get list of Post OBJECTS, not list "of some data". This approach helps You with creating business logic for Your apps (what and how objects can do) instead of writing sql queries and manipulating them directly. There are basically two main approches in ORM's - Active Record and Data Mapper. Read about both and choose one which suits better Your project. Of course ORM is not "golden bullet" for everything with "db access", but for great majority of projects it will be very helpfull (there are some potential performance issues but usually there are "fixable" :)) &amp;#x200B; Directly to Your question: Expression Language (SQLAlchemy Core) - this is what You use if You want to write "almost raw SQL" (with help of some classes) SQLAlchemy ORM - this is what You use if You want to use ORM approach. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; 
At work we are now experimenting with adding GraphQL subscriptions to [Ariadne](https://github.com/mirumee/ariadne), our library for writing GraphQL servers. We've got working proof of concept using `asyncio` and Django channels 2 we can't wait to release to people to use, but we want to have generic solution using ASGI or maybe build-in binding for Starlettes too before we release. 
I've been doing Python for around a year now, trying to balance it with school work, and I've only now realised how slow I've been at actually getting stuff done. Using Python I could probably program as well as you, which is amazing considering you've only just started. What I mean by this is: 1. I admire the fact you've learnt so much so quickly 2. I realise how slowly I've actually been learning.
I know what a database is and what SQL is but as beginner I google how to insert a record in a database using SQLAlchemy Core I get code samples showing different methods ...which confuse me ...that and the lack of structured documentation, adequate for learning

There's no reason that parrallelism is about doing the same thing, your cores can work on anything they want and if you want to sit on the toilet and brush your teeth you can do it. Concurrency on the other hand doesn't let you do this, you can sit on the toilet with your toothbrush in your mouth and switch to brushing while you're waiting for it to flush, but you can't do two things at once.

I wanted to learn Scrapy and had this project in mind. I watch a lot of r/videos and one issue I run into is casting to my Chromecast when I'm in my living room. The Reddit app I use opens Youtube links in the in-app browser. This drove me to want a Youtube playlist with the top posts of r/videos from that day. &amp;#x200B; I use Scrapy to scrape Reddit and the Youtube Data API to post the videos to the playlist as well as comment on each video with the original Reddit title and a link to the Reddit comment section. &amp;#x200B; Admittedly I just found out about praw from the wordcloud post the other day. That would definitely clean up the code but I had already got it working with Scrapy. &amp;#x200B; \[source\]([https://github.com/jkleve/reddit-videos-youtube-poster](https://github.com/jkleve/reddit-videos-youtube-poster))
Trying to figure out how to automatically parse complex nested dictionaries. Issue I am running into is an upper level key is the same as the lower level key, so the upper level’s value is being overwritten by the lower level. I want it to just extend the dictionary, not overwrite it. 
Thanks so much, that is really awesome to hear. And good luck!
\&gt; but one-off things don't need to be elegant &amp;#x200B; Right until that code gets copy/pasted in 4 other areas.
Yes, if Anaconda is available for chrome OS. A very quick overview, Anaconda is a distribution of python that includes some extra functionality that's supposed to make it easier to use. You can use an online environment like PythonAnywhere from your chromebook just fine. 
These are all still w.i.p. but as soon as I get them functional I will be sure to post and explain about them. Me being me it'll probably take quite a while to work on those two specifically. Just keep an eye out and I'm sure they'll pop up here.
Oh okay thank you very much!
Good luck You are off to a good start!! Try the free books online and stack overflow if you get stuck. I use them constantly even after years of experience and the folks really help out. 
Honestly, french was the reason I went into maths rather than languages - and I'm truly grateful for that
I fail to se how machine learning can help you with that
You can get messages from your bot on Telegram while building on CI. This was the idea.
As another 40+ guy who has had a few years experience in Python, I can tell you that you will never stop learning as there's always something to discover.
Nope I gave it .pyc file as input not an exe. So you suspect that this is because of my code but not an issue with the library itself?
I don’t know if you can strictly adhere to clean code as laid out in the books but you can keep in mind OOP best practices when designing. As long as your code follows SOLID principles clean code should be easy to achieve. https://medium.com/@cramirez92/s-o-l-i-d-the-first-5-priciples-of-object-oriented-design-with-javascript-790f6ac9b9fa 
I think the Python Discord is perfect for what you describe. [https://pythondiscord.com/](https://pythondiscord.com/) &amp;#x200B;
Depends on what you're doing that is CPU bound... If your computing I'd suggest using Cython with typing and use the with nogil to run threads. It's a bit of pain, but depending on the time complexity it will have huge payoffs. Other than that, I find most of my code is I/O bound so the async library or even trio if I'm in a pinch works just as well. The first step is to start with profiling, optimize the slow parts using std lib functions, more than likely you're probably not using it to its fullest extent. Try to minimize looping as much as possible and try to manage your data holding classes as closely as possible. Hope that helps! I've had alot of bad experience trying to work with threads and processes, but once you get it, it just clicks! That's why I love Python.
sorry still not understanding..i am new to programming. 
[removed]
Thanks for the advice. I too believe creating absolute environment agnostic code can be too much of a hassle and may not even be possible everytime. Adhering to the SOLID principles is the best bet for most of my projects.
You could also handle dev in the cloud - like https://www.pythonanywhere.com/
it's an old site collecting irc quotes.

What do you mean when you say "share a drive". What does actually happen? 1. Are they sharing a physical device via something like SATA / SCSI cable? 2. Are they sharing a virtual drive via something like iSCSI? 3. Are they actually sharing a filesystem rather than drive, i.e. SMB / NFS / FTP? 4. Is this some new-fashion Kubernetes volume thing? So... if it is... 1. No, that isn't really possible, these protocols assume there's only one machine connected to storage device, so you'll create havoc if you try to do that. 2. Same as one, but over internet. 3. FTP - not possible. NFS - possible if your NFS server runs locking service and all programs accessing the file are aware of locks (they are advisory in NFS). SMB - possible, just lock the file and make other copies wait for the lock to be lifted. 4. Will depend on specifics of the volume.
In my school in high school french was required in 8 and 9, then I think m in 10 we had the option between French Spanish or Japanese then 11 languages were optional. I don't learn languages well and don't like being forced to learn something so it's nothing against french itself but I hated French class cause I was forced to be there when I could have been learning something useful (to me) like Python (if my school had it).

Probably Visual Studio Code. 
This guy over here [https://overiq.com/sqlalchemy-101/crud-using-sqlalchemy-core/](https://overiq.com/sqlalchemy-101/crud-using-sqlalchemy-core/) managed to put in one page, in a very clear way, the info I was looking for. Very basic info I challenge you to find a similar one I spent some time finding it ...wasted time. I must say I started with a book when I saw I could not grasp the essentials from the SQLAlchemy docs. There are very few authors who can actually write books properly... 
I know know it's your code/limitations in the library. I've only ever used it on Python 2.7. &gt; Python support is strongest in Python 2 for 2.7 and drops off as you get further away from that. Support is also probably pretty good for python 2.3-2.4 since a lot of the goodness of early the version of the decompiler from that era has been preserved (and Python compilation in that era was minimal) &gt; There is some work to do on the lower end Python versions which is more difficult for us to handle since we don't have a Python interpreter for versions 1.6, and 2.0. &gt; **In the Python 3 series, Python support is is strongest around 3.4 or 3.3 and drops off as you move further away from those versions**. Python 3.0 is weird in that it in some ways resembles 2.6 more than it does 3.1 or 2.7. **Python 3.6 changes things drastically by using word codes rather than byte codes**. As a result, the jump offset field in a jump instruction argument has been reduced. This makes the EXTENDED_ARG instructions are now more prevalent in jump instruction; previously they had been rare. Perhaps to compensate for the additional EXTENDED_ARG instructions, additional jump optimization has been added. So in sum handling control flow by ad hoc means as is currently done is worse. &gt; Between Python 3.5, 3.6 and 3.7 there have been major changes to the MAKE_FUNCTION and CALL_FUNCTION instructions. &gt; **Currently not all Python magic numbers are supported. Specifically in some versions of Python, notably Python 3.6, the magic number has changes several times within a version**. We support only the released magic. There are also customized Python interpreters, notably Dropbox, which use their own magic and encrypt bytcode. With the exception of the Dropbox's old Python 2.5 interpreter this kind of thing is not handled. https://github.com/rocky/python-uncompyle6
PyCharm, Visual Studio Code and IDLE (maybe to learn can be good)
Haha, keep up the good work! There might be "weird stuff" like lambdas but those are also good to know when you start to use sorting, map and filter etc. Feel free to ask anything, there is no such thing as stupid question.
Jupyter notebooks - I think executing code cell by cell in a minimalist environment will be more clear for new learners than a fancy IDE. Once they master prototyping in Jupyter, perhaps have them build out a small package while utilizing VS Code or similar.
Definitely pycharm or vscode. The run/debug engine in pycharm is excellent and will be great for people to learn what's actually happening at run time by inspecting variables, seeing how code is changing values, etc. 
I’m actually taking over a class that is currently using Jupyter remotely. Can it be downloaded and installed onto a computer without needing internet access? Actually, I’m sure it can. I’m guessing they’re saving their work remotely because they don’t always have access to the same computer.
Thanks @u/lunar-orbiter - beta invites go out about once per week. Feel free to shoot me a private message anytime
One approach is to use VPython. There are many examples on the web using it to visualize physics simulations. 
Discord bot. It's fun.
Problem: you have an object in python and you want to store its state in a database for later retrieval. Solution, old style: you write a bunch of SQL queries to store, retrieve and search rows, then parse these rows and reconstruct the object. Solution, modern style: you use an ORM that basically does the above for you. SQLAlchemy has two approaches to declare what you have: procedural and declarative. They kind of do the same, but the second if faster than the other. procedural: you write code that runs and defines what kind of objects you want to handle, their relations (e.g. this object contains multiple references to these other objects). declarative: it's a fast way of declaring what you want, and let SQLAlchemy do the conversion between what you mean and the procedural part that you would have written if you had time to spare or desire for pain. That's it really. The only additional thing is that SQLAlchemy also wraps different backends (MySQL, Postgres, etc) and those backends may or may not support some features natively, such as transactions. SQLAlchemy tries to emulate them, or simply throw exceptions when not present in the backend. Another thing that is important to know is that in order to minimise traffic to and from the backend, SQLAlchemy records all the changes that you want to do in an internal ledger and then submits them at once to the backend. This (but not only this) adds a lot of issues when it comes to data locking, concurrent modifications, etc. And that's why db programmers are paid a lot. 
But there is difference and I meant to use `while not text` and not `while text is None` for a reason. text = "" while not text: text = input("Input text: ") Will ask you to input text until you give text that is not "". text = None while text is None: text = input("Input text: ") Will exit the while loop after any input whether it was empty or not. But yeah, as I implemented validation functions I should have really gone with: # Run endlessly while True: # Ask user to input text via input/getpass text = method(message) # List all error messages for inputted text errors = [ error_msg for val_func, error_msg in validations if val_func(text)] # Iterate over each error message for error in errors: # Print error message for each failing validation function print(error) # If there was no errors, return text and length if not errors: return text, len(text) Reddit text editor is not designed for coding, forgive me any errors.
Got it
Would you mind sharing the course?
Nice! Have you thought about plotting them on a map?
Oh yeah, but I am still learning. I’d like to make the graph live first so it shows and updates how many quakes are happening each hour and/or day. Then try to add this to an interface through tkinter or something similar. I really enjoy thinking of ways to use the data and how to present it. Sure, the USGS site has these features but making my own is fun and encouraging.
Looks pretty good! If I were nitpicking, I'd say you could use `logging`'s string formatting syntax instead of concatenation, and get the logger using `logging.getLogger(__name__ + ".display")`, which means that if you refactor this to becoming an importable module, it'll adapt the name automatically. You can use tools like flake8 to statically analyse and lint your code, and black to make sure it's formatted well; I think gitlab has a built-in CI server which means you can run those tools automatically whenever you push changes.
Well, let's demystify a few things. asyncio ======= This library mostly doesn't know how to do I/O. Most devices capable of doing I/O aren't handled by this library. So, for example, this library is irrelevant for files, keyboard, microphone, webcam etc. It only really works with sockets. Not the underlying machinery, like TCP or IP, sockets. But, it's invention... well, reinvention in Python happened too late. Kind of. Because it doesn't do async I/O with sockets either. But, hold your breath, it's actually a good thing! And here's why. This is how async I/O is supposed to work: 1. User-space program sends an I/O request to kernel. 2. Kernel instantly replies. 4. User-space program does whatever the hell it wants, for a while. 5. After a while kernel interrupts the user-space program and tells it "here's the I/O you wanted". There are two major problems here: 1. Kernel doesn't reply instantly all the time... sometimes it gets stuck, especially if there are errors. 2. It's not clear how kernel is supposed to wake up the program that called it. 3. Most important of all, in real-life high-performant systems (i.e. not running Python, doing some real work) have such high bandwidth, that the overhead of interrupts is becoming too big, and so polling becomes a lot more effective, if you can poll multiple sources jointly. And this is, essentially, what `asyncio` does: polling. Nothing asynchronous is going on there. It's a glorified busy-beaver loop. But it's good because... like I wrote earlier, bandwidth is high. threads ======= Suck. Threads in Python suck ten time more because you are doing all this very error-prone acrobatics for very little gain. But when it comes to I/O, threads are terrible. Whatever the size of your thread pool, it will never be enough, and if you have all your threads busy... erhm... actually doing nothing, but waiting for system on blocking I/O calls, your system will appear using like 0.1% of your CPU, with a ton of threads, all of them sleeping. So, no work being done, system is unresponsive, and performance will have a very big variance. You'll start having bursts and times when the system is completely still, even if you think you are spreading your load evenly. ---- Bottom line: `asyncio` is a good concept, but Python's execution of it is terrible to the point it's laughable. But mostly it is useless (as in with file I/O). Threads can perform better with file I/O, but on toy projects (but why would you use Python for a real thing anyways?).
If you're using that, I may recommend Spyder. &amp;#x200B; I'm not sure if the installation process achieved more clarity as of late but if you're accessing Jupyter Spyder is a good extension of the tool.
Yes, jupyter notebooks can be run and stored locally with no need for internet access.

quite a good and succinct description of the idea behind SQLAlchemy Now what is need is the same for the major modules they have. I get lost in that structure and as quoted in the beginning of this post things are contradicting each other
We are all learning. :-) Look up an old program called xearth, maybe work on incorporating something like it into an interface. 
What programming language do you like?
Learning about using Python with Blender. I think it is going to be easier than learning just Blender since scripts allow me to organize my thoughts and see each step. Just placing things using the normal Blender in interface is unintuitive for me.
Thanks for the tip. I will look that up for sure.
Not really the correct way, because I started using the python pandas library in Jupiter notebooks which are really cool but not optimal, if you didn't start with the basics. My colleagues started wanting to use my scripts, since they were faster than excel, then I had to learn how to pack them into a simple Web app :) I am by no means an expert, but, like you, I can write useful scripts that work.
Trying to wrap up work on my SQL linter this week. I think I'm done with features I want to add at the moment, so the focus now is making sure the docs are approachable and cover all the important parts. https://github.com/erik/squabble
&gt; as beginner I google how to insert a record in a database using SQLAlchemy Core As a beginner, please read through this to see how to insert a record: https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/orm/tutorial.html There is a [section](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/orm/tutorial.html#adding-and-updating-objects) addressing your concern. Also, I would add: there are other more convenient ORMs in Python (peewee, orator, ponyorm) but SQLAlchemy is the more battle-tested with the widest variety of features and it implements the Data Mapper pattern instead of the Active Record pattern. 
I broke it, but don't have time to figure out why, so maybe you could debug your own code :) It seems that if you guess the exact word + more letters than you can't ever get the right answer. secret word: type guess: typewriter If you guess type again, it won't return a success. 
Keep in mind the SQLite may perform poorly or incorrectly over network shared disks. From their “when to use” article: &gt; SQLite will work over a network filesystem, but because of the latency associated with most network filesystems, performance will not be great. Also, file locking logic is buggy in many network filesystem implementations (on both Unix and Windows). If file locking does not work correctly, two or more clients might try to modify the same part of the same database at the same time, resulting in corruption. Because this problem results from bugs in the underlying filesystem implementation, there is nothing SQLite can do to prevent it. &gt; &gt; A good rule of thumb is to avoid using SQLite in situations where the same database will be accessed directly (without an intervening application server) and simultaneously from many computers over a network. Source: https://www.sqlite.org/whentouse.html I’m the author of [Disk Cache](http://www.grantjenks.com/docs/diskcache/) which provides persistent data types like dict and deque atop SQLite. Generally works great for cross-process communication but I’ve had issues reported about poor performance over network shares.

/r/learnpython Python is 3 different things (in addition to the snake). 1. A language specification. A book of rules which says what outputs you should get, given a particular set of inputs. This is technically what is meant by python. 2. An implementation of this language specification. The reference implementation, which is often what people refer to as python, is technically CPython (because it's written in C), but there are lots of others at varying degrees of completeness. 3. A distribution (aka a way of getting an implementation). You can download the official distribution from python.org, but there are lots of other ways of getting it - called "distributions", these often come with other tools alongside the basic interpreter. Anaconda is a distribution. It includes the CPython implementation of the Python language, as well as a lot of tools largely based around data science, and `conda`, a tool for managing dependencies, environments, and so on. So if you install anaconda, you will have CPython, which can run Python programs. My recommendation is to not buy a chromebook for programming. I recommend something x86-based which can easily run ubuntu linux.

It works, you've got the initiative to teach yourself and you're willing to put your code on display and get feedback. As someone who is mostly self-taught (and has been coding for over 20 years), IMO the last part is the hardest but most valuable part. I started as a Unix sysadmin, learned shell scripting, moved on to Perl, then ColdFusion, then Java, then C#, Python, and PHP. I'm pretty much a "Jack of all trades, master of none", but its ensured that for all but about 3 months in two decades, I've been gainfully (and usually comfortably) employed. Well done, and my best to you in your efforts moving forward.
vscode no doubt
Sounds stupid, I think I know what they mean though. If you're using prints to check that the program works as expected, you should be using unit tests. If you're using prints to help you understand what is happening as you develop code, you should be using a debugger ideally. 
Get every function/method you have, give it different inputs and see if they output what you expect and if they handle exceptions the proper way.
Plots that you can interact with e.g. hover over and see data in a tooltip, or the chart changes color when you click on it. Stuff like that. They are much more difficult to create compared to static visualizations, and usually require JS under the hood.
String concatenation is one of the first things you learn in programming in any language. Usually it takes on the form of something like this: `myString = "Hello" + " " + "World!` `# myString now equals "Hello World!"` Well that is great and all, but not the fastest or easiest to understand thing in the world. So Python developers came up with `string.format()` which can be used instead. That looks like this: `myString = "Hello {}".format("World!")` This produces the exact same thing as the code above, and is even faster both to type and to run. You can also do advanced things like `myFloat = 3.14159265` `myString = "Limit to two decimal places: {0:.2}".format(myFloat)` The concept of f-strings is simply the same thing, just instead of having the format at the end of the string you have it WITHIN the string. This produces the following: `myString = f"Hello {"World!"}"` `myString = f"Limit to two decimal places: {myFloat:.2f}"` Similar speed, much faster to type and just as fast to run. Works in Python 3.6+ Hope that helps!
Use pytest. First advice. Read through this: https://docs.python-guide.org/writing/tests/ 
You're getting a line break when you assign your array from a text file. You can strip the line break with the following code, although this is a very over engineered solution to a problem unless you'er doing some assignment that requires arrays username = array\[0\].rstrip("\\n\\r") password = array\[1\].rstrip("\\n\\r") &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
&gt; If your computing I'd suggest using Cython with typing and use the with nogil to run threads. It's a bit of pain Or you can rewrite CPU-intensive parts of your code in [Nim](https://nim-lang.org/), which has Python-like syntax with C-like speeds, and use [nimpy library](https://github.com/yglukhov/nimpy) to easily connect Nim and Python. I did exactly that in [one of my experiments](https://narimiran.github.io/2018/05/10/python-numpy-nim.html) and it was both easy and successful.
Hi! I'm the guy who wrote Aletheia. "Solves" isn't a word I like to use for this, but rather "fights" as it can only really be a contributing technology in that fight. In the end, the problem of fake news is a social one that has to be solved by people. The usefulness of Aletheia is that we can use it to add context to our sharing of stuff, to get us to the point of not trusting something *unless* it's been signed. Watch my [presentation at PyCon UK](https://youtu.be/dRnqqEwXNCY) for more info :-)
I've looked at them, most are pretty trivial aside from Anchors C.

Getting a job that requires you to learn Python would be the best way. But outside of that I hear good things about automate the boring stuff, and Linux academy has some good stuff too, though it's a bit pricy now. 
Nice try, boss.
wow! thanks man, I hadn't even known about this. Sounds much easier to work with than Cython, will def give it a try.

People who say this are way oversimplifying programming. There are multiple reasons to use \`print()\`. 1. Logging 1. It is better to use [the built in python logging instead](https://docs.python.org/2/howto/logging.html) 2. Debugging when something is breaking 1. Use [the built in python debugger (pdb)](https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/pdb.html) or better [ipdb](https://github.com/gotcha/ipdb). Don't get in the habit of using pycharms or another ide's debugger you will regret it when your code is running on a server 3. Manually reviewing output 1. Depending on what your program does this can be an ok thing to do. [Writing unit tests is ideal for most cases](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/). 1. If you are writing a function that gets data from a server or live source this can be hard to write unit tests for if you do not have a test instance of the data that is in a constant state. You might want to write some integration tests for those. 2. If you are not sure what is happening most of the time it is better to use ipdb for the first couple of runs then write some tests that validate what you saw and you can run if you ever change your code to ensure the results you want are still happening. &amp;#x200B; Hope that made at least a little sense. Sorry for the weird bullet point format haha. &amp;#x200B;

If it's stupid and it works, it's not stupid. Good Job! 
Your code is complete shit, it's so hard to look at. Congratz on that first step
Well kudos for that; didn't know the signal module was a thing
Thanks a lot. Been on this for a while and this was the missing piece.
I don't know if this counts, but I made a python script to print out the weather (with a printer) in the middle of the night. I have since stopped the program as it became a waste of paper over time.
I think You underestimate SQLAlchemy library a little and try to use it "not by it's default purpose". Of course it provides lower level access to DB (core), but mainly it is ORM (which You are trying **not** to use). My **guess** is that "core" docs part is not prepared for "entry level", but for people who needs it to "tweak" higher level behaviour. For me it's quite readable (but of course i understand not for everybody). And the lib is available on github with quite helpfull comments. If You want to use "almost" raw SQL, then maybe better way will be usage of even lower level libs eg. psycopg2 (for postgres), MySQLdb (for mysql) etc. (they usually fulfill: [https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0249/](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0249/)). But trust me - ORM's are a good thing. If You are not preparing super heavy app, it's a good idea to learn it, even for simple app (especially if You are starting with python). It will benefit later. Selects / updates / inserts are just one part of data management. "Good ORM" will help You schema-migrations (often automatically), data integrity / validation (even before "db error"), data-migration (not automatically, but will have standard for "creating" them), and You will work on Objects (they can do something) instead of iterating through "some lists with some data". Simple apps almost always grow. Sorry for not taking challenge - we all struggle with docs sometimes. Some of them are better, some of them are worse, some of them are better not to read :). It's open-source, remember, You can always contribute :)
To your edited question: Adding a dictionary to your app is relatively straightforward. You'll need to find a suitable dictionary. Linux systems (maybe macs as well?) often have a dictionary at `/usr/share/dict/words`. Then you'll want it in a form where you can quickly query if something is in the dictionary. There are several ways to implement this. The most basic is to create a list of your words. As we'll see, this is not ideal, but can be a useful exercise. To find a particular word, you'll have to either: * Check each word in order to see if it matches, which could involve checking every single word in the dictionary. This is super simple, because all you have to do is write `if my_word in word_list:`, but it's slow. It's also easy to implement manually as a function, if you want the practice. This is called linear search. * or, since the words are sorted, implement a binary search routine, which compares the query word to the middle word in the dictionary (using `&lt;` or `cmp`), and if the query word is less than the middle word, perform the same search on the middle word of the first half of the dictionary. If it's greater, perform the same search on the second half. If it's equal return true. If the "half" you need to process next is empty, return false. This is called binary search. Linear search requires in the worst case as many lookups as there are entries in the dictionary. Computer science calls this `O(N)` performance (maybe Omega(N), I don't always remember the difference, but they're similar enough for most purposes). (N is the number of elements in the list). Binary is faster, as it requires O(Log N) time in the worst case, but it can only be used if the list is sorted in advance (linear search doesn't care about the order of the list). A better approach, which is fortunately just as easy in python, is to use a set. Sets implement lookup as an O(1) operation, which is the fancy way of saying that looking up an entry will take the same amount of time regardless of how many entries are in your dictionary. To use this, all you need to do is read the words from your dictionary file into a set object, and then do `if query_word in word_set:`. Example: # First we define WORD_SET outside our function so we don't recreate it # every time we want to look up a word. Naming global constants in all caps # is standard style. WORD_SET = set() for line in open('/usr/share/dict/words'): # .strip() removes the line break from the end of each line in the file WORD_SET.add(line.strip()) def contains(my_word): if my_word in WORD_SET: return True else: return False Or to condense that into more idiomatic python: # The thing in the braces is a "set comprehension," if you want to google it. WORD_SET = {line.strip() for line in open('/usr/share/dict/words')} def contains(my_word): # `my_word in WORD_SET` already returns a boolean, so wrapping it in an # if/else condition, and then returning a manually declared boolean as we # did above is redundant. return my_word in WORD_SET 
I love it ,every 3 months you should look back at old code and say "Who the hell wrote this? They didn't name things right. They obviously don't understand the Adapter pattern! Oh yeah, I wrote this."
What code have you written?
Doable? Yes. Good idea? No.
Why limit yourself with python, bro. You should do that shit in perl. It's the new _if you can dream it, you can build it language of 2019!_
Can I know why it is a bad idea? 
Because Python is slow. Like, _really_ slow.
i deleted everything, starting from scratch
You can simplify a lot of your checks by using the `in` operator.

PyGame will be fine for small "8bit style" games so if thats your graphic style it should be fine, if you want more 3d stuff and MMO features, i would look more toward UE3 or Unity. 
I'm a student so can't do job right now 
For example if You create function that will be often use with "some" same arguments. Eg. (py3) `from functools import partial` `def create_living_creature(type, age):` `print ('You created %s. It\'s %s years old' % (type, age))` `create_human = partial(create_living_creature, 'human')` `create_cat = partial(create_living_creature, 'cat')` `create_human(15)` `create_human(24)` `create_human(55)` `create_cat(3)` `create_cat(5)` That will print You: `You created human. It's 15 years old` `You created human. It's 24 years old` `You created human. It's 55 years old` `You created cat. It's 3 years old` `You created cat. It's 5 years old`
Yeah I guess it's looking like this idea might be best suited for another engine. With that in mind, I'm going to cook up some smaller 8-bit styled ideas so I can get some extension Python practice. 
I had no idea `partial` existed. Interesting use case!
High school, you say? Teenagers? They're still at the age where they would usually get beatings and hard work to make them into hardened adults. I'd say go with Vim. They'll struggle and fail, and struggle more. But in the end...they'll be better for it. :D &amp;#x200B; But no, I kid. I'd go with Atom. It has a really nice interface, it's completely free, and has tons of great packages to install. That's my preference, at any rate. And you can install Jupyter notebooks inside of it as well if you like.
Thanks, yeah the error message seemed straight forward I just wasn't sure how to proceed in fixing it. I did post in learn python as well. Thank you for the quick comments and help!
They share a network drive. So when you open My Computer on windows, the drive appears there
I will try this one out and see. It's a little program, trying to make it work without a database.

Honestly, i don't think IDLE is a bad choice, anything "heavier" might confuse the students. Furthermore, you probably don't need any IDE-features, except IDLE's "F5-to-run".
Direct link to online demo here: [https://framed.fwd.wf/](https://framed.fwd.wf/) Only a minimal amount of this code is in Python actually (most of the text processing / analysis is done client-side), but I think this community would give me the most helpful feedback. The coolest features (question answering and abstractive summarization) are done using Python libraries. This is a passion project that I've submitted to this season's Pioneer's grant application. It's dropped in rank the last couple of weeks, and the final progress update is due next Monday, where the community will vote on which applications will win. So, I definitely need all the feedback I can get on improving the core features, UI / UX, etc. to try and secure a winning place. I think there's an immense amount of value Frame can offer. I see the biggest selling point as an automated data ingestion feature, to allow users to have instant access to massive amounts of collected industry knowledge through a conversational interface (think Hitchhiker's guide!). But I feel like that's something time-consuming and would have to come later as well. Appreciate your responses, positive or critical!

Using `os.path.join` (even with a single argument) to make code compatible with both pathlib and strings in a cross-compatible way is great trick.
Another option is to use WinPython which comes with Spyder, Jupyter, NumPy, SciPy, and numerous other packages. You can choose whatever version of Python you need, and it runs in a self-contained folder. I just installed a new version for a project yesterday and noticed it now comes with an app called Pyzo which is an editor/shell sort-of-IDE similar to Spyder. WinPython - [https://winpython.github.io/](https://winpython.github.io/) Pyzo - [https://pyzo.org/](https://pyzo.org/) &amp;#x200B;
It's pretty decent - logic is clear, methods are kept simple, variable names are good. A couple of comments... if column in user_stats.keys(): should just be if column in user_stats: assuming that user_stats is a dictionary. Why make _user_stats_to_row() a staticmethod? It's only called once in your class and you pass self._column_names. I'd just make it a regular 'self' method instead: def _user_stats_to_row(self, user_stats): row = [] for column in self._column_names: if column in user_stats: row.append(user_stats[column]) else: row.append('???') return row staticmethods are okay (though some style guides discourage them), but if you have too many of them it's maybe a sign your class doesn't actually need to be a class at all. 
It's not too bad. OK for freestanding code that short.
To be fair. Vsc is a code editor not a full IDE. 
So far, the only thing I don't like about pathlib is syntax like this.`ignore_path = directory / '.gitignore'` It just looks wrong. 
Download the anaconda distro. It can be installed without admin rights (on Windows). I think it's the same for Mac OS. With that you have everything you need for your python programming. Within anaconda there is the best python IDE (my opinion): Spyder3 https://www.anaconda.com/download/#macos
Lubuntu
Really like this! It'd be great to add a spell checker so that if you're looking up and spell it wrong, it offers you a couple of suggestions of what you may have been trying to spell. If I get time later this year, I may try to add this feature. Are you taking feature requests on the GitHub?
Oh cmon with some extensions its one of best app do develop in python :). Personally i like it more than pycharm. Now with MS python extension with autocomplete, debbugger, pyunit integration, black formatter, project manager plugin etc. it’s more than enough :). These days imho diffrence between „boosted” editor and IDE is kind of symbolic :).
Pycharm is great and has amazing tools to help with debugging code, but if you want them to learn without crutches, I'd use the stat card Python IDE that comes with python installer for windows.
Why not just build something?
I can't see any reason at all to pick Atom over Vs code today. Can you enlighten me about what I potentially missing?

I was going to say that Atom isn't owned by Microsoft, but with GitHub's recent acquisition by Microsoft even *that* isn't true anymore. I guess you could fork an old version or something.

What is your job ?
Getting kids to code it and run it is my main goal. Installing packages and other more involved stuff needs to come later.
Mobile autocorrect. Stock IDE
They’re currently running Jupyter. I haven’t looked it over myself so I may or may not stick with that.
try to look at the Godot engine, it uses GDScript with Python syntax
I tried that but couldn’t get it to run the code! How do you do that?
Great. Thanks!
Great, thanks!
Pythin might be the best language for a project like thism IMO. If you need more than a text interface try the curses library. There are more robust graphics libraries like pygame too, if you need those. Biggest benefit of python when making games is the ability to focus entirely on the logic of your game. Very little gets in the way of that. Goos luck!
I’ll try pycharm. Thanks!
I wish I knew that Core is for the Pro and ORM is high level. I thought that you need to be familiar with on in order to get to the next level. PI could not read nothing along your recommendations in the docs ... I wish I knew. Now I am over the hump, is not that much the complexity of the concepts as much as it is the complicated way they are explained
Unrelated to IDE: You might want to look up Teaching Python on your favorite podcast. It is two teachers teaching Python at middle school level, but still might have some pointers.
This is a very complex game genre to engineer. I'd recommend doing a roguelike or visual novel to start.
Microsoft has done more good for open source community in the last 10 years than many companies. It isn't the Microsoft of old. Hey, we have free private GitHub repos now. That being said, PyCharm all the way.
To me, it depends on what you plan on teaching. If you're going to keep it simple I'd use a lightweight text editor like Atom or sublime text.
In PyCharm, if you get kids used to making a virtual environment by default and a `requirements.txt` file in the root of the project, PyCharm prompts and installs most packages with a click on the "should I install the package?" link.
Sure. Well: 1) Atom is community based and open source instead of Microsoft. While I am not an MS hater by any means, I just like the idea of the community making its own IDE and keeping it open. 2) It looks and feels really nice. I know that may not matter to some, but it's easy on the eyes for me. VS is nice but just not as smooth I think. 3) I like all the packages it already has. They've been very useful to me and you can set up your python programming environment pretty much any way you like. 4) I know some people say it's a bit slow to respond but I haven't really noticed that. To be fair, I'm still learning and I don't have huge pages of code opened in 100 tabs, so maybe that might be an issue for some, but it hasn't been for me yet. :) I did try VS and I did like it, I just happen to prefer Atom is all. But hey...I actually am not a partisan. I mean I think people should use whatever they like best which gets the job done. If somebody likes Vim, they should use that. If somebody likes PyCharm, they should use that. I just think that people should also give Atom a try as well. :D 
The most sensitive part of doing it would be the rendering code, mainly because of geometry/linear algebra calculations. You'll need to do that part in a native language to achieve a decent speed. Everything else can be done in python. But that's only relevant if you're writing the rendering youself, which is probably overkill if you only want to write a game. The best you can do with python is probably look for some 3D engine bindings, but I don't think you'll find many modern engines like that. There are bindings for disney's Panda3D (it's actually written for python), Ogre3D, Irrlicht, but they're all kinda old. Another viable approach would be picking a C++-native engine and integrate it with python for scripting, but there lighterweight languages that are more common for that kind of integration, such as lua, squirrel, etc. Game development is a weak point for python, unfortunately. For quickly making a game you'd be better off just using one of the modern engines that do everything for you. Unreal, Godot, etc are great options.
I run Jupyter inside of Atom. It's pretty nice. Best of both worlds. :) There's a package you an install for it. Just search packages for Hydrogen and you can run Jupyter notebooks inside of Atom. Select code blocks and hit shift-enter and it'll run it live just like Jupyter blocks. 
It's crazy how Microsoft and Google have swapped on the ethics spectrum in the last few years.
``` src = Path('src') ignore = Path(src, '.gitignore') # OR Path('src').joinpath('.gitignore') ``` works too
Four words. Unit tests around `threading`.

The game is a text based game where you manage an entire ship but with more details on starting to engines, having a limited amount of energy, you know stuff like that but theres also no graphics like 3D Models, more of just Buttons and words.
As in, the IDE that comes with it?
&gt; it became a waste of paper over time ...it wasn't one at the beginning?
Good suggestion! Will do
Oh, that sounds easy.
Sweet. Thanks!
I wouldn’t teach anyone to use IDLE, personally. PyCharm and VSC are pretty slick, though.
Exactly. Once they are comfortable with the rules of Python, I would upgrade to Pycharm. Teach them correct whitespace and such, THEN let them play with the toys that will do it for them.
The downside is not experiencing `pip` itself. But it is a good way to easily make venvs for each project and teach them why this is important.
Glad I could help you learn. Cheers!
I dont see any difference with a lambda function
That’s funny 
Sounds interesting!
One of the best uses imho was in my first role where I took a complex VBA linked spreadsheet nightmare the financial institution had set up and simply deleted all their VBA, and changed the macro to call python (using xlwings, great library) where I'd feed their data into a data frame and operate on it there. The original VBA program could return 1000 matches in 15 minutes(epochs in computer time) was suddenly giving them 100,000 in 5 seconds(the time to communicate with Excel essentially.) The old VBA programmer guy started hanging out with me more after that. The only difficulties in letting others use the program after he bought in was getting python on people's systems under the system admins watchful gaze, much like Sam and Frodo sneaking into Mordor to destroy the Excel macro. 
Thonny is terrific for this audience. Thonny.org. All in one install. Built in REPL. Has autocomplete but not in your face like many IDEs. Open source. Written in Python. Free.

That was definitely the best scene in Lord of the Rings.
I'm teaching middle and high school students computer science right now, so I can help answer that as well. I teach them python and JavaScript, though I'm hoping to move them away from JavaScript once I have the time and knowledge to actually write a curriculum to replace the one we're paying for. There are a lot of elective classes at my school, so I generally get motivated kids. Unfortunately, that also means that if I want to keep students signing up (and if there aren't enough kids, there isn't a position for me), I have to keep homework loads low. That, coupled with the fact that my courses are semester long, not year long, means we don't get as far as I'd like. But overall the kids are engaged and excited, though I teach internationally so many of the parents still see this computer programming thing the same way they see art: A cute distraction from the hard work of getting a real job like lawyer or doctor. That's turning around a little, but still definitely present. And as for your project, that's a really impressive project for just a month in. I know it feels like it isn't good and there are other comments below I'm sure which explain how you can make it better. But this is very good for a month in. Well done!

This is really a cool idea! I’m kind of nerd about optimizing my note taking setup, and this seems like a really fascinating way of building intelligence into my note taking tools. The one thing stopping me from jumping on it is the lack of documentation. Did I miss a link to the docs on the github repo?
Right now I’m testing a tool used for car diagnostics and for each car the locations and file names of the logs are different but each file begins the same way. So I wrote a script to search the parent directory of the tool (it’s windows based so really just the C drive. Thank god it’s an SSD lol) looking for any text files created within “x” amount of time in seconds of the current system time and if it finds one checks if it’s got the right heading. If it does, that file is automatically placed in a folder inside a folder named the as the time the logs were taken on the desktop of the tool which I then just dump on a USB to look at later. All i do is write down the time I plugged the tool into the car and cross check later. It took like two hours to get it perfect but oh my god does it save time considering a lot of vehicles generate 4/5 logs at a time when connected to the tool. 
There's always `.joinpath()`.

Experienced exactly the same. As a dev I have an 'open client' not so for the end users. Oh the struggle to get python on those systems. And pypi blocked for the necessary modules. 
This article is really good, with practical examples. Don't let the first example fool you, it's significantly better than your typical "Here's a partially applied add function. Congratulations, you're now a fully qualified partial applier!" kind of tutorial: [https://chriskiehl.com/article/Cleaner-coding-through-partially-applied-functions](https://chriskiehl.com/article/Cleaner-coding-through-partially-applied-functions)
Thanks!
or, and I've never used PathLib. \`ignore\_path = Path(directory, '.gitignore')\`
Very thorough, thanks for writing!
Thanks for the feedback, yeah sorry I should've mentioned it's not designed for mobile at all, although it is responsive. The plan would be to have a native mobile app connected to the cloud platform (eventually) 
&gt; "folder{}path{}file".format(pathseperator) Dear god no, *that* is the bad habit.
Are you talking about docs for the code, or usage instructions? There's a readme in the GitHub repo and example entries in the app. Eventually before the project grows large I'd like to refactor the code and write documentation, as it is open-source and meant to be extended
Very good, really enjoyable reading.
Or `Path(f"{directory}/.gitignore")` with what the article says about automatically normalizing path separators.
I'm note sure where Python fits into your assignment? Are you supposed to solve the differential equation using something like sympy? Or are you supposed to integrate numerically? 
Hey OP I have tested the downloader but it seems to only work with albums and not with playlists. Not sure if something has changed in the spotify API here is the error: \`\`\` Traceback (most recent call last): File "[init.py](https://init.py)", line 142, in &lt;module&gt; MainProcessor() File "[init.py](https://init.py)", line 26, in \_\_init\_\_ self.get\_given\_params() File "[init.py](https://init.py)", line 67, in get\_given\_params self.identify\_given\_source(params.source) File "[init.py](https://init.py)", line 126, in identify\_given\_source LoadPlaylist(username, playlist\_id, self.save\_directory) File "library/spotify.py", line 63, in \_\_init\_\_ self.request\_playlist\_tracks() File "library/spotify.py", line 80, in request\_playlist\_tracks while results\['next'\]: KeyError: 'next' \`\`\`
Thank you! I'll refactor these. Any idea why the last test is failing?

The source of truth is often the PEP that justified its deliverance... [https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0309/#id22](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0309/#id22) I've seen it used when passing a function call as an argument; the routine it calls might add a few arguments of it's own then invoke it, or return it without invoking. &amp;#x200B; It's applicable to abstraction scenarios where you might do something with a function call but the actual function being called is variable. &amp;#x200B; I've often thought it would be useful to avoid having to go through all the rigmarole of a formal OO "Builder" pattern, when constructing objects that have lots of parameters, but can't say I've ever actually done that. &amp;#x200B;

Looks good to me. Traditional path construction lines tend to be some of the ugliest and densest LOC I see regularly written in python. 
Did you mean more than 50 tracks? I saw that `next` is missing too in the output: ```dict_keys(['collaborative', 'description', 'external_urls', 'followers', 'href', 'id', 'images', 'name', 'owner', 'primary_color', 'public', 'snapshot_id', 'tracks', 'type', 'uri'])``` It's a cool tool nevertheless.

My biggest beef with pathlib is that its too new for a majority of the standard library to understand how to use it. I end up using `str(path)` to compensate.
oh yes, more than 50 tracks ^^'
I'd love to see a text editor chapter. With features like line numbers, syntax highlighting, etc. 
I was just learning about them today. Thanks!
Both I suppose. From a user perspective, an introduction to the existing features of the app and how to use them effectively would be great. I’m also very curious about the code, extending it to run OCR against imported handwritten notes or PDFs would be sweet. Especially if you could train the OCR neural net to more accurately recognize your own handwriting. A lot of precanned OCR stuff does poorly if you have terrible handwriting
I’ll be working on getting a better grasp at Python. I’m new to Python and programming languages and eeeeverything. This is my second week of learning Python, and I’m so proud every time I get make any type of code that works! 
Actually I know why it failed. Solving now.
You're welcome! I hope you find it useful. :) 
I made a push that should fix this issue, let me know if you encounter any problems
Saved for when I get farther in my education :)
While I cannot disagree that Pycharm is one of the best IDEs out there, I may argue against it. The fact that it is feature rich might be attractive to the more experienced programmers, however, a beginner might just think that it's just too bloated and unintuitive. Not to mention JetBrains IDEs are not known for being able to run on lower spec PCs. With that said, I would recommend either VSCode or Sublime Text. Both are easy to setup and lightweight. Additionaly, you may want to teach them how to run a Python script via terminal. I should also point out that when I took a programming course at university, most of my colleagues hadn't written a single line of code until then and they all were feeling quite comfortable using the Python IDLE itself. I don't think it's a bad idea at all, you might wanna consider it. It's even easier and faster to setup since it comes built-in with the Python installation anyway. I believe these text editors really shine when working on a larger project and you constantly need to jump from file to file and quickly navigate through folders. If you are going to simply introduce them to programming, I believe your students shouldn't stumble upon any issues while using the IDLE, though they might think VSCode looks a lot better and I think they would be right.
I addressed that a bit more in the first article. Python 3.6 fixed almost all of those and Python 3.7 fixed the ones that affect all the pathlib code I've written so far. I've had a couple edgecase ones pointed out (e.g. `subprocess.run` accepts `Path` objects for arguments but not for the process path itself) but they now seem rare. But most of us aren't running Python 3.7 in production (I'm not) so I feel your pain.
The more official/direct way is `os.fspath` which does something similar (converts `pathlib.Path` objects to strings or keeps path strings as strings). Both of those only work on Python 3.6+ since `os.path.join` didn't accept `pathlib.Path` objects in 3.5 or earlier and `os.fspath` was added in Python 3.6. But if your code already uses `os.path.join` and you're on Python 3.6 or newer, your `pathlib.Path` objects will be accepted as arguments just fine. :)
I didnt understand them at all, thanks!! 
Nice. 1.5 thoughts. 1. You should mention that someone should just use functools.lru_cache instead of the Memoize decorator. .5. This is black magic, but a decorator need not return a function. @type def x(): pass x # &lt;type 'function'&gt; works. This hasn't ever been useful as far as I've seen. But, its somewhat helpful for explaining the desugaring.
Yes all of these work. I honestly don't know which I prefer most. I know I personally like `/` best but many don't and I can understand it looking/feeling too odd. Currently I think these are my preferences in order: 1. `ignore_path = directory / '.gitignore'` 2. `ignore_path = directory.joinpath('.gitignore')` 3. `ignore_path = Path(directory, '.gitignore')` 4. `ignore_path = Path(f"{directory}/.gitignore")` I like to tell my students that "there should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it" from the Zen of Python is aspirational. The question of "how do I join `Path` objects" seems to have too many "right" answers.
Hey man, that seems fun. I'm learning python and my plan to the future is to work with tech and finance. After learning python itself, what do you think I should study?
To me the strongest use case is when a function takes a callback of N arguments and you want to use a function of &gt;N arguments with some of the arguments already filled out. To give an example: def greater_than(x, y): return y &gt; x filter(partial(greater_than, 2), [1, 2, 3, 4]) filter(partial(greater_than, 3), [1, 2, 3, 4]) 
you order pizza's for a living?
I forwarded it to my private WordPress site, thank you very much!
Here's a use case I had: A library I use frequently, pyspark, allows you to define functions that operate over the subsets of a dataframe that is distributed within a Hadoop cluster. The library does not allow these functions to take any parameters besides the subset of the dataframe, but I needed to have additional data available for my function, and this data needed to be determined at run-time (so, I could not simply hard code the values into the function). Solution: create a partial function that freezes all of my additional parameters. The result is a function that has access to all the data I needed it to have while also satisfying the library's requirement for the function to only accept a single parameter.
That was great, and perfect timing. I just started playing with a library that offers a decorator and I wanted to do some voodoo in my decorated functions. Now I know how python interacts with decorators! Thank you!
I have a moral objection to overloading arithmetic operators for non-math-like operations. `+` for string concatenation is well-established enough to be acceptable, and follows the general meaning of "combine these two things". `&lt;&lt;` and `&gt;&gt;` for C++'s stream operations and `/` for path concatenation seem too "clever".
That's a fun idea. Since the book is now funded I may add that as a stretch goal
Defining them like this or in some other structure is probably the simplest way. You could do something with os.walk if you didnt know the paths but if you do then your way seems the simplest.

Your readers will need an infinite loop that checks when the file was last modified. If you don't want your writer to write while the others are reading, I think you could have each reader create a lock file named with a random string like "READER_BFHRU.txt". If the writer see's any file that matches that pattern (or simply starts with READER and ends with .txt), then don't write. Once the lock files are released/deleted, the writer can write again. Never used this, but I googled python lock file https://github.com/derpston/python-simpleflock 
Yikes. Please use Pathlib https://realpython.com/python-pathlib/
Same goes for me. I finally learnt decorators. Was struggling with them for a while. Can you explain built-in decorators like @staticmethod? That’s the only one I’ve used before.

At uni, as an asignment/project, me and a few colleagues had to make a pytorch copy, a machine learning framework that's a wrapper around numpy. Things were getting good, we had a good progress, we even made some data generator functions, but things got a bit complicated and we started to disagree about some implementation details, so the team decided they will just discard my fully-working, blazingly-fast, optimized, not-hardcoded, modular approach that works on a lot of examples, and take their slow and horrible python code because "it's what professors told us to do" and "works with the provided data". The mentors gave us a code review and found a dozen or more issues, and now guess what I'll be working on this week :)
If you can use relative paths or paths provided by the user that is another way. Storing the prefix in an environment variable can also work. Basically parameterize the path so you don't have to worry about platform in your code - since in most situations you don't want to hard-code the prefix even per-platform. If you really want to keep the prefixes in your code then it can help to set the prefix in ONE place and reference that elsewhere, like: prefix = { 'nt': '\\filerA1\filer\folder', 'posix': '/nfs/folder' }[os.name] os.path.join(prefix, path1, path2)
Pilot. I have a raspberry pi running that I just keep all my scripts on. Here’s a couple: one automatically checks me into flights when I fly commercial, one texts me my flight schedule when it comes out and another adds my schedule to my calendar. 
I'll give it a try
RemindMe! 3 days
Working on a little procedurally generated game. Keep getting hung up on a step for connecting objects but I'll figure it out eventually!
Great read, thank you.
Decorators are fun. Used one in a monkey patch and it worked just fine. Figured it would, but it was still nice to see it work.
The value of `os.path.join` is that it works on python 2.7 as well. My use case was a updating a library which is compatible with python 2 and 3, but which only accepted string arguments. By using `os.path.join`, it keeps all of the functionality it had before, but now also accepts Paths in 3.6+. But it's a good point that `os.path.join` doesn't work on Paths in pythons 3.4 and 3.5 which are not EOL yet.
Interested in the flight check in script... I need to do something like this so I can always board first
My biggest annoyince with decorators.. in debugger if you put breakpoint on func you end up in some decorator. So annoying.
Used to be a (Windows) Server Admin. I wrote scripts that check user's activities in client machines and send back to a service I build on the server; force log out if user doesn't register long-running tasks. Another scripts that help me clean up and organize resources.
To be fair, 1000 matches in 15 minutes is indicative of bad coding, not issues with VBA.
Look up beautiful soup package in python. It is built exactly for this!
Ah got it. Python 2.7/3.6 support would make sense in that case. You could always `str(...)` the string/Path if you needed to support 3.5 or earlier.
Great job so far! I know you probably spent a bit of time getting that far, buuuuut I’m going to recommend a different approach, I think it’s worth the effort. Use the requests module and the beautiful soup (bs4) module. As far as logging in with requests you’ll probably need to create a session. You can than use beautiful soup to pull data out of the scraped HTML. The video below is a good one to show you how easy beautiful soup is! https://youtu.be/F1kZ39SvuGE
I didn’t automate all my work tasks, but I’m a data analyst and run a script to do all my email followups which would normally take me and hour + per day depending how many projects I have. I also have to enter these sample data uploads which take around 30ish minutes by hand, they are now done in 2 minutes by pressing a button. I’m working on scripting another part but I need to learn how to connect Python to SQL first. If you have a job where you can automate the whole thing, you could, in essence, get everyone fired and collect all their paychecks..I don’t think a job like that exists to be honest. Maybe I’m wrong.
Thank You, this is what I have been researching. All of the examples and lessons I have come across are showing how to open a web page and extracting the data from there. The code usually includes a URL for the page. My code has a URL as well but after logging in that URL changes. How do I tell BeautifulSoup to extract the data from the current page, or will it automatically default to doing that? 
In my experience, decorators are one of the most difficult Python tools to work with. Your article explains them very well. Thanks so much!
Yeah, I wanted to avoid `str` in case of unicode shenanigans in py2.
Might want to look into SQLite.
I enjoyed pycharm but you can have some issues importing. Spyder is decent but isn't as friendly as pycharm
It's a syntax difference, really. Just like there's no difference between `sum(values)` and `_total = 0; for val in values: _total += val; _total`. The difference is that when you use a specific tool instead of a general-purpose tool it's easier to read (for people familiar with the specific tool) because it saves the person the effort of recognizing that the general-purpose tool is being used in a certain pattern corresponding to the one that the specific tool was made for.
Just a tip: in list/dict manipulation within Python, it is alway better to build a new object with the data you want, and put it into the original object you intend to change.
Thank You ! Yes, it took me quite a long time getting that far. I have no problem starting over if that's what I need to do. This video is very helpful.
Depending on your experience level with SQL you might want to check out [Records](https://github.com/kennethreitz/records) or [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/library.html). 
PyODBC from Microsoft works flawlessly https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/connect/python/pyodbc/python-sql-driver-pyodbc?view=sql-server-2017
BTW, I use closures a lot for that exact use case, like: def outer(arg): def inner(): do_something_with(arg) return inner b = a.map(outer(“Hello, world!”)) Whether closures or partials are more convenient depends on the function.
guess we'll have to agree to disagree 
Hmm interesting use of e-paper.
Heya nice post. I was reading it and copying the code,so that I can study the code in further detail later; but when I got to the part where you introduce the fetch\_webpage function, I got the error import requests ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'requests' &amp;#x200B; Any idea what this is about? Thanks again for the article :D
Thanks for the feedback mate! It's hard to say since I'm still picking up many finance aspects w/ Python, so I'm probably not too far off from where you are now. If it helps, I plan on learning more about stochastic calculus since to solidify my math skills when it comes to creating trading strategies. I can for sure recommend 'Python for Finance: Analyze Big Data' by Yves Hilpisch, I've been referencing it quite a bit throughout my project. Hope this helps!
You can never order too much pizza

Trying to program a magic square verifier. I am new to python and literally stuck. Can anyone help? 
Nice article! You should probably mention `functools.wraps` though. Without it you lose the decorated function's name and docstring.
Do you have GitHub link?
thanks, good to know. I will definetely check them after I am done with my pythons basics
For the White House I’ll bet
You need to install the requests module. Run in terminal: `pip install requests`
This sort of question is better asked in a subreddit that answers questions about python, such as /r/learnpython. When you post over there please don't post images of your code, use pastebin.com or similar.
Look at the last two lines of each file should show you why.
Does this show live pricing? My biggest frustration with Dominoes is their hidden pricing until check out. It infuriates me. 
I send you a PR (https://github.com/Eshkation/SpotifyDownloader/pull/1) that fixed the issue for me. I think it is related to the newest spotipy version but not sure. The pagination still does not work though when there are more than 100 songs but I think it might be a problem in spotipy as well see the PR.
i use jupyter notebooks with sql magics https://towardsdatascience.com/jupyter-magics-with-sql-921370099589
I monitor our system performance and Stevie all of my ad-hoc analysis to run in Python. Why, if it's only a 'one' time analysis? It's never a one time and I always find errors in the data source which are easy to correct and then rerun a full days worth of work in seconds. 
Thanks, now I know what to search for next
Thank you! I appreciate the help.
Thanks I will be checking it out. Now have to see how github works lol
Get this man a job at Google NOW!
I use sys.platform If sys.platform == "win32": Path = \whatever If sys.platform == "linux": Path = /linuxpath
Interesting definately will look into those afte having a grasp of python
Jarvis Johnson did a neat video on this
Yeah am a little bit of a over thinker if I dont see a clear path or have things perfetly aligned I will make excuses and procrastinate until the perfect time has come.

Usually there's more work once you've automated stuff. I automated a good chunk of what happened at a startup and there was just more work. Hell, I'm trying to launch a new app/website and am automating things there - I'm writing an instagram automatic posting bot right now that generates image posts from various categories with certain types of text on it, and posts them to instagram automatically

Same here man, it's my second week and I'm having fun.
Ha yes that's it! Oh don't download all the files and run them its just supposed to be illustrative over overengineering a problem FizzBuzz is a small test that sometimes people get as an interview question: For numbers 1 through 100, if the number is divisible by 3 print Fizz; if the number is divisible by 5 print Buzz; if the number is divisible by 3 and 5 (15) print FizzBuzz; else, print the number. You might be asked to write it up in psuedo code or python or c#, but the reason is its supposed to be simple result for i in range(1,100): if i % 3 == 0: result = 'Fizz' ..etc But that fizzbuzz repo is a joke made by software developers where they take every crazy design pattern and software best practice and over engineer the fuck out of it for shits an giggles Ha I don't even know where to start in how that library is funny... using spring and interfaces and probably dependency injection lol..... all of these things for something that's 10 lines of code. Why? So when I am at work with our architecture department I'll sometimes joke with them... that's some enterprize fizzbuzz you got there if I think it's overengineered. This is from someone who completely believes in source control, CI/CD, etc. The point is just be reasonable. 
Stock Python 3 should give you the option to just use: python3 -m venv &lt;virtual environment path&gt; VS Code can automatically detect the virtual environment and use it for syntax highlighting and suggestions if the location of your virtual environment is `./.venv` in the current open project.
Yea I think this is what i was looking to cut out with Python - the right click / export piece. I know this will sound a little strange, but I own the dashboards (although a central team builds). What i was hoping to do was automate the process of right click / extract for distribution purposes. 
This was before I had a smartphone, so it was super handy at the time to have a copy of the weather away from home.
IMO this is a very minor point. Pathlib doesn't help with platform-specific prefixes, in this case it's just prettier than using `os.path.join`.
Folks, read the documentation. Most comments here instructing entirely too much work, introducing entirely too much potential for error. This work is already done for you: - [`os.path`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.path.html) Above the fold, second note: &gt;Since different operating systems have different path name conventions, there are several versions of this module in the standard library. The [`os.path`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.path.html#module-os.path) module is always the path module suitable for the operating system Python is running on, and therefore usable for local paths. [...] Or, if you must construct the path yourself, you may access the system's path separator: - [`os.sep`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.sep) &gt;The character used by the operating system to separate pathname components. [...] Better yet, use... - [`pathlib`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html) ...as u/slowpush has already pointed out.
Yes!! There is already an open issue regarding this, feel free to contribute

Slow? Or slower than C++, which I assume is what is besf here given that it's the thing every game engine uses except for Unity which uses C# if remember correctly. 
Not *all* my work, but our company recently upgraded the Enterprise system (SAP, which I still don't see the appeal), and the timesheet entering become a tedious pain in the butt. So I used `selenium` and `tkinter` to create my own interface for entering my weekly time. Now it's just one click of a button instead of click here click there wait forever to load. On the other hand, most of my actual automation happens on VBA.
Or you could just go be a pilot like /u/hcir614. Those guys are always on the plane first.

This is one of the greatest benefits of Python: There's probably a library for it already. Case in point, I wanted to search craigslist programatically and was all ready to break out the requests and BS4 libraries to accomplish my task. On a whim I searched for a craigslist library and found [python-craigslist](https://pypi.org/project/python-craigslist/).
I met someone who used vba to automate the most time consuming process at a call center. Once you completed 12 calls you were done for the day. He was done at noon and after a while his turnaround time on calls was #1 in the call center by a significant margin. Once they figured out what he did, they laid off like half the staff and promoted him. I think productivity went up 400 or 500%. His program was essentially gluing together several different systems in an absolutely hack way. 
I agree except I also hate the + for strings other than += I always advise against using the + operator with strings. Mainly because the .format and format strings do an implicit cast to str so a = "test" + b + c will raise an exception if b or c is not a string.

What do you think your bosses would do if they find out? Just curious.
Mine isn't anything crazy, but my old job had us take a 30 min break and 30 min lunch everyday. I moved up to a position where they didnt care when I took them. So I made a little program that would put me into lunch code, break code, then save my stuff and clock me out. I would just leave one hour early.
Oh really? Damn that sucks.

I'll give you one for free: extract punctuation marks from text for making Markov chains of the text. Take the text of Alice in wonderland on project Greenberg. That actually accomplishes something useful. 
Slower than C++, slower than C#, slower than Java, slower than Lua, slower than Rust, slower than most things you'd use for games really. 
Actually, I kinda have a use for your second point: def Singleton(*args, **kwargs): def construct(cls): return cls(*args, **kwargs) return construct @Singleton("my_singleton") class t: def __init__(self, name, x=42): self.name = name self.x = x def print_me(self): print(f"{self.name}'s value is: {self.x}") t.print_me() # outputs: my_singleton's value is: 42 `construct()` is the actual decorator here and it returns a single instance of a class, not a function.

I haven't yet dabbled with NLTK and I have only read basics about Markov chains from 'Think Python' not sure what you meant by this exercise, if it is to delete all punctuation marks, the character set `[[:punct:]]` provided by `regex` module would help - there are also set operations provided, so you can choose which punctuations to retain and so on.. one could use `string.punctuation` as well the exercises in the book are mostly about getting the user to understand the syntax/features of regular expressions.. agree that I need to add more case studies and use real world examples (planned for next version), but I do not agree that they are trivial nor that they can be easily solved without regular expressions.. when the exercise says extract from `is` to `t` - the solution depends on user knowing the difference between greedy and non-greedy quantifiers, knowing which function to use and so on so once again, I would say we'll agree to disagree about regular expressions
I'd recommend VSCode. It does take a little bit of setup, like installing the python extension (which involves searching for "python" and clicking "Install"). The reason I say this though, is that VSCode looks cool and modern. Before you scoff at that, remember that it's kids you're dealing with, and that might actually go a long way if you think about it for a moment. I guarantee it plays a big role when it comes to first impressions, especially for kids.
That API is likely so other apps can post photos directly to Instagram not for the intention of automated upload
I tried that and i'm getting this, http://prntscr.com/m7sdhs
You could also use .format Print("your final value is {}".format(gorceries()) Or to make it more readable you can assign the returned value of groceries() to a variable and add it that way final = groceries() Print("your final value is {}".format(final) As you can see there's about 1million ways go skin a cat in python.
As far as I can tell, it may be limited to certain partners anyway.

There are several advantages `partial` has over lambdas: 1. Early variable binding. Consider the list `[lambda: i for i in range(10)]`. You might expect this would create functions that return the values 0-9. However, because of late variable binding (the lambdas are bound to the variable `i`, when it changes the return value you get will as well), the functions all return `9`. `partial` circumvents this issue since the function it creates doesn't know anything about that `i` variable, just the value it contained when `partial` was called. 2. Introspection: It is easy to extract the function and arguments passed to it in a `partial`, but in a lambda you'd need to do bytecode hacks. This might seem not so useful, but I actually made [use](https://github.com/benburrill/gardener/blob/8722fecdcaef4394151c34732b84ad77c2b184b1/gardener.py#L91) of this kinda recently in an actual project, using partials as a simple data structure to represent deferred actions. I formatted the docstring of the function with the arguments that were partially applied to the function to provide a description of the action. 3. Better debugging: Related to introspection, `partial` reprs actually provide useful information: `functools.partial(&lt;class 'int'&gt;, '10FFFF', base=16)`, whereas with lambdas all you get is `&lt;function &lt;lambda&gt; at 0x7f30052dc598&gt;`. 4. `partial`s are probably faster and take up less memory than lambdas, but I haven't actually tested this.
Oh got it, I actually thought it was a game test lol for i in range(1,100): if i % 3 == 0: result = 'Fizz' After understanding this, it just blew my mind out. I would've probably written an IF statement for each number
You need another set of brackets to convert the entire float type number to a string. final_value = "Your total: " + str( ( int(a) * .5 ) + ( int(b) * .2 ) + ( int(p) * .75 ) ) Review this, it'll help... https://automatetheboringstuff.com/chapter1/
Partials are very different than lambdas. Partials allow you to pass some of the arguments into a function and specify the rest later. For instance, is I have a function add(x,y) I can use partials to say add5 = partial(add, 5) and then I can call add5 like add5(2) # = 7. This is also called Currying after some mathematician name Curry who got tired of moving around arguments to his math functions on paper so he'd define a new function that would be the old function plus some arguments already given.
Thanks by the answer, I learned something interesting.
/r/learnpython 
`add5 = partial(add, 5)` == `add5 = lambda x: add(x, 5)`
Performance trick for VBA is to disable screen updating and formulas before calling a function. It's night and day
So, it's an SMB share. Well, it supports locking. So, what you need to do is: all copies of the program need to contend for the lock on this file. The one holding the lock can write and read from the file. Every copy will need to release the lock every so often so that others can also get access to the file. This is obviously a cooperative concurrency scheme, but you cannot do better with files. Meaning that if one copy of the program fails while still holding the lock and never releases it... well, nothing will work anymore. But, if your goal is communication rather than modifying a particular file, then there are all sorts of message queues, with all kinds of models of broadcast / subscription. There are also distributed key-value databases that can accomplish the same thing, if you also need persistence.
For this purpose, I'd go with Spyder. It's simple to use, has a solid debugger, and gives equal real estate to the editor and the notebook-style terminal. It's really very conducive to learning because it encourages experimenting in the notebook instead of in the text editor. I often use it when I'm learning a new API or library and expect to do a lot of experimentation. It's also a nice balance between the mountain of features in a full blown IDE versus something like Jupyter Notebooks. 
Sir iam not clear with your answer. Can you please tell me what is it that Iam doing wrong
Although /u/memes_420 is wrong by implying that you can't use lambdas to do something similar to `add5 = partial(add, 5); add5(2)` and by saying that currying and partial application are the same thing, there are important differences between the lambda way of partially applying functions and the `partial` way (especially when dealing with variables), which I explained in [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/agcrt9/partial_functions/ee6g04i/).
I like languages that build from first principles. But I also like languages that present a challenge, because overcoming these challenges is a form of art. Neither, unfortunately, means the language can be a practical programming language. So, if the later is a concern, I'd judge the language's runtime by how well it can utilize the computer resources and how easy it is to establish the correctness of my programs. For example, language like Python scores very low in every category: it neither builds from first principles, nor is it really a challenge. It cannot exploit computer resources well, neither the hardware nor the operating system utilities. It offers next to no help in establishing any useful properties of programs are implemented the way the programmer intended for them to. It's a kind of Facebook of programming languages: it is popular because it is popular and the more popular it is the more popular it gets. It's basics are also relatively easy to pick up, so buying into this whole popularity contest is made a lot easier.
Ah, none of those four cases have been difficulties with the things that I've worked on so far.
this sub is not suitable for these questions see the description. try /r/learnpython to get better answers faster. 
50% of coding is using stackoverflow. 
If I need confidence and a decent guarantee that this stuff will work in the future, then I don't trust Python to do these things. I'd rather outsource this to libraries which know how to do this. `rsync` is one of those libraries.
I'll give you my favorite builtin decorators/*. `property`, `setter`, and `deleter`. They don't return functions, they return [descriptors](https://docs.python.org/2/howto/descriptor.html): classes with the `__get__`, `__set__` and `__delete__` magic methods defined. Properties are super handy to allow everything outside of the class to be able to think of something as a variable. Take, for example, a D&amp;D style stat: class stat: def __init__(self, value): self.value = value @property def mod(self): return (self.value-10)//2 This lets you do something like: dex = stat(15) print(dex.value, dex.mod, sep=', ') dex.value = 18 print(dex.value, dex.mod, sep=', ') and it will happily print `15, 2` and then `18, 4`. It will recalculate the stat mod without you needing to recalculate or explicitly call `dex.mod`. This can clear up a lot of brainspace for your future self, who don't want to concern himself with the mechanics inside the stat class. However, let's say that you want to set a character's stat not by changing the value itself, but by changing the mod. Right now, if we entered `dex.mod = 5` we get an `AttributeError` saying we can't set that. To do that, we'll need to show the property how to set it, through `setter`. Changing our stat class to this will work: class stat: def __init__(self, value): self.value = value @property def mod(self): return (self.value-10)//2 @mod.setter def mod(self, newmod): self.value = newmod*2+10 While normally this would look really strange: You define a method, then instantly overwrite it? More, you're calling an attribute of a function‽ Well, technically, any function can be a decorator. Functions that take functions and return other functions are the most common, but you can have them return any object. Python won't complain. As said before, `property` returns a descriptor, and gives it a couple extra methods to allow you to further define how to set the value. But it works, if you then enter: dex = stat(10) print(dex.value, dex.mod, sep = ', ') dex.mod = 5 print(dex.value, dex.mod, sep = ', ') now, instead of getting an `AttributeError` like we did last time, it happily returns something: `10, 0` and `20, 5`. Setting `mod` will now change `value`, and setting `value` will now change mod. Which is awesome, and really handy in the case of D&amp;D stats, since the two are inextricably linked. Though a word of warning: When someone asks for `dex.mod`, they're not expecting the program to do anything other than return a value. Or if your function takes a really long time to run, or worse, if it changes other variables in your code, you can confuse the shit out of anyone writing your code. It's a _really_ bad idea to do that. I had to overhaul large segments of my own code because I used properties a bit too gratuitously. Also, if you include a docstring on the method just after `@property`, that becomes the docstring for the property itself. However, I don't believe that docstrings for the setter or deleter methods are accessible. So make sure to add any notes about what the property is trying to do, and what side-effects may occur to the right place.
I'm sure you didn't ask for this, but still here's the [docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#staticmethod) on @staticmethod, just in case. And to be honest, I don't think you need to learn how those built-in decorators work under the hood, it'd be a good learning exercise of course, but that'd be the only reason of doing it. Standard library functions are meant to be accepted at the level of encapsulation they come with. 
&gt; .5. This is black magic, but a decorator need not return a function. This is actually what `property` does. It doesn't return a function, it returns a [descriptor](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/descriptor.html)
Oh yeah I didn't think about this. Thanks /u/zardeh and /u/mafrasi2 I investigated further and it turns out that decorators can return anything and everything. There's not much use of it though. &gt;&gt;&gt; def decorator(func): ... return 'sumit' ... &gt;&gt;&gt; @decorator ... def hello_world(): ... print('hello world') ... &gt;&gt;&gt; hello_world 'sumit'
Thanks you!
I'm sure that won't be long :D
You're welcome! Glad I could help.
You're welcome :D
Thank you! And thanks to /u/legendaryeggnog for helping out with your problem.
Excellent tutorial! I'm going to add this to recommended reading for all my students :)
Oh I didn't know about that! I'll add it at the end of the article.
You're welcome!
I use it for doing prebuilt classes with certain arguments. It's a little less strict than making a whole new class, and also shortens things significantly. For instance, if I had a weapon class (pos, ammo, and fire rate) I would define each weapon as a partial that defines the ammo and fire rate. Then to instance I just pass the position. 
Haha there's a flip side to everything.
You're welcome!
Glad I could help you learn!

&gt; Windows 10 Poor kids... Why do you have to shove this proprietary garbage down the throats of the kids who simply don't know any better? You are doing this world a great disservice... For the kind of programs you'd teach in high school you don't need stuff like PyCharm (I don't really know when you *do* need it, but I'm certain it's not for this kind of audience). The reason for this is that you want to have an environment you can fully control and understand (PyCharm or VSCode and the likes are huge programs with a lot of corner cases, you really don't want to invest time into infrastructure maintenance when doing teaching). But, all you need to do programming in Python is: OS, Python interpreter and the ability to store source code. When I learned to program, it was on "IBM-compatible" terminals, about 16 of them connected to a 2086 machine, the server could run this many copies of Lexicon editor and a QBASIC interpreter. The server ran on DOS. I wasn't some kind of prodigy, and I didn't even intend to program for my professional career. But, I'm quite sure that I've learned more about programming from that class, than what I see kids learn nowadays from "Introduction to CS with Python 101" college courses. Sometimes, less is more.
Some examples would be appreciated
Since this post is getting some attention, I wanted to do a little shameless plug. I'm actively looking for contract jobs as a Python developer, specializing in back-end development. [Here's](https://www.reddit.com/r/forhire/comments/afnzda/for_hire_python_backend_development_expert/) a r/forhire post I made two days ago. If you're interested DM me and we can take it from there. I'm hoping this doesn't break any rules of this sub. Thanks!
Wait but why? Where were you working that required this?
This is great! thx, I wish there would be a nicer way to yield control rather than await asyncio.sleep(0)
Try it using standard IDLE, it would make it easier for them to start programming at home aswell (its a little easier than messing with interpreters in PyCharm). And if they ever have any complains, just show them the alternatives.
Do you have a sample of this you’d willing to share?
Details man 
Not necessarily: python can do blazingly fast things on arrays. I just finished testing FFT code on an array that is 200,000,000 doubles (i.e. 1.6 gigabytes). It finished in just over 2 minutes. It also helped that I was using the Python MKL libraries which are multi-core and SIMD optimised. Try that in VBA, and phrases such as "heat death of the universe" spring to mind.
Updating dependencies and addressing DeprecationWarning's. I wish there were better tools! (atm., what works best for me are \`pipenv\` and \`safety\`)
Now is this a good or bad thing? Honestly do not know how to interpret this comment.
Atom runs without install (download, ctrl-click, open, allow). Python venv can be stored on a USB stick (YMMV if /Volumes/&lt;name&gt; changes). PyPy doesn't require installation, only to be unpacked. &amp;#x200B; P.S. PyCharm too has portable edition. P.P.S. Python has (had?) a runnable OSX download. &amp;#x200B;
Please make it SaaS! Or post a [repl.it](https://repl.it) link :)
Some suggestions: 1. This is a great use case for asyncio, and that will allow you to simplify your code a lot. 2. Please give your functions and variables meaningful names. 3. Your README file doesn't explain what your script actually does.

I was not given a choice regarding Windows 10. I myself learned some programming on an IBM 286 running DOS and BASIC back when I was in middle school. But here I am inheriting a class for Python. I could technically switch it to Java if I wanted but I’d rather save that idea for the Fall semester. Either way, I’m more focused on just getting the kids to be able to code it and run it, hassle free. I was shown some online coding program where you copy chunks of instructions to move something around. It looks innovative enough to teach someone the ideas behind designing an algorithm but I do think there’s something more to getting your hands dirty and building more from the ground up, as it were. I agree with your “less is more” sentiment and wish I could start them off with BASIC on an old DOS machine (or the modern day equivalent) but that just isn’t an option.
Thanks!

I am still a newbie. In what so called programming but may be you check jupyter notebook. ....,. Or you head for the mother python website for data Https://www.pydata.org
This is much cleaner. 
I challenge you to write a program that calculates total job years experience. You will need to prompt for: company name, start date, end date. Compute the total years experience for each company Print all companies, start, end date, total experience in years And finally add up all the years from all companies to figure out the total number of years. Bonus: Allow the user to remove entries Super bonus : Store the entries in a text file or sql-lite db So you save the entries Why? (also hints on how to achieve this) This will teach you how to use datetime libraries How to use and iterate through dicts and tuples or lists (depending on your approach) If you find datetime too complex you can use pendelum. In which case you get introduced to pip as well. 
&gt; You say "Correction" but the documentation doesn't contradict anything I say. In fact it supports it: the **only** language-wide promises it makes about the return result of `id` is that: &gt; &gt; - it is an integer; &gt; - it is unique and constant for this object during its lifetime. &gt; &gt; Everything else is an implementation detail and *subject to change without notice*. This is fundamentally incorrect. It is subject to change, yes. But not without notice. It was an implementation detail that dictionaries were unordered. It was notified when changed to be ordered. It was bumped from an implementation detail to a reference specification in the next minor version, making it mandatory for all implementations. &gt; That's how you know it can't be defined as a memory address, because in Jython and IronPython objects can move in memory. Other implementations, such as PyPy and even CPython, might someday get a memory manager which can move objects around. Perhaps, but that would be notified. At which point either the implementation detail would change (which as I said above would be notified), or it won't change but the returned ids might become outdated. However I doubt this, because within the `ctypes` module it allows you to treat any Python object as a generic Python object C structure and allows you to get addresses and other information as well. &gt; I called the result of `id` an "abstract ID number", when I could have been more precise and note that it is an integer. Although in fairness, who has ever heard of an ID number being represented by a fraction like 7/9 or a surd like √2? In context, it should have been obvious that an abstract ID number is going to be an integer. I don't know why you're defending yourself here. Abstract ID number, integer, I don't care about that. I care about the whole "you can't guarantee it's the address". Yes, you can, in the CPython versions in which it is mentioned that that is the implementation detail, and you can be safe in the sense that you will know if it changed, by seeing that note removed or changed from the documentation or a changelog indicating such. &gt; I also said that it was an accident if `id` returned a memory address. Of course I didn't mean "somebody tripped over, hit their head on the keyboard, and lo and behold, `id` returned a memory address". I meant an *accident of implementation* as opposed to a language design choice. If the language wanted to promise that `id` would return the object's address, they would have called the function `get_address` or something. There are no accidents. Implementation is done for a variety of reasons. I don't know what was the reason in this case, but I'd guess convenience. They may not have wanted to promise it for the language as a whole, but they did promise it as noting it specifically in CPython as an implementation detail. &gt; That's not what the docs say! They docs are clear that it is an *implementation detail* not a promise you can rely on. The whole point of something being implementation rather than interface is that it is subject to change without notice. An implementation detail *can* be relied on *within the scope of the implementation*. It is not without notice. And all CPython 3.4.3 versions will all act the same way in the sense of `id`'s behavior. No matter what system. No matter what country. No matter what anything. So long as it is the official CPython 3.4.3 binary or source release, it will do exactly the same thing. With respect I'm not going to quote and respond to the next two paragraphs because they just reiterate your same previous points. &gt; Even when you know that the specific version of Python you have uses the memory address as the ID number, what can you do with it? Nothing. You can't dereference the address or do pointer arithmetic , you can't [peek or poke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PEEK_and_POKE) that address, you can't take this address and get the object back. There's literally nothing you can do with this "address" in Python. &gt; &gt; (Note: I'm only talking about pure Python code. The C API and `ctypes` are different, of course, since they are specifically all about the interface between Python itself and the CPython internals. I don't know much about them, and I find it hard to believe that they don't supply a proper API for getting the address of an object instead of the "use `id`" hack.) Actually you can't get the address from within ctypes, (the `addressof` function doesn't give you an address unless the type is a `ctypes` type, and the `ctypes.py_object` type is a special wrapper type and you won't get the address of the true object). And you can't get it from the C API because that's redundant. In C, you have an operator for that. In Python, whether you believe it or not, the recommendation is to use `id` (when in CPython). As for dereferencing, the fact that you can do so with ctypes is the very point. If for whatever reason you want to use pointers in CPython, you *can*. It's actually a useful segue to showing a new student "you fucking fool *never* do this, but in the super off chance you need to, fine. But every time you do this a puppy dies so try other things first". In case you were wondering, the code to dereference is as follows (assuming of course, it still exists)-- pointer_to_obj = id(obj) ... from_deref = ctypes.cast(pointer_to_obj, ctypes.py_object).value ... from_deref is obj # True Furthermore, yes, there are other uses than this super weird one. Namely, I once worked freelance on a project where one of the previous developers new C but not Python. They wrote code in C, using the Python C API, but not any of the extension module boilerplate, because they couldn't be bothered. And I couldn't be bothered to add the boilerplate or just rewrite it into Python because I wasn't being paid for that nor enough to justify that. So I chugged along using a ctypes-based dynamically loaded library pushing the addresses of python objects into this guy's C functions. Was it hell? Yes, but it was better than the alternative.

**PEEK and POKE** In computing, PEEK and POKE are commands used in some high-level programming languages for accessing the contents of a specific memory cell referenced by its memory address. These commands are particularly associated with the BASIC programming language, though some other languages such as Pascal and COMAL, have these commands as well. These commands are comparable in their roles to pointers in the C language and some other programming languages. The PEEK and POKE commands were conceived in early personal computing systems to serve a variety of purposes, especially for modifying special memory-mapped hardware registers to control particular functions of the computer such as the input/output peripherals. *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Python/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28

I have a pretty complex django project that was 90% done that I abandoned in September last year because I got some kind of weird anxiety about not knowing how to finish it off. I'm going to work to simplify it and get the basic features up and running on something like pythonanywhere, just so I actually have something to show for what I've done so far. Does anybody have any recommendations for getting a django project up and running on pythonanywhere (or a similar service?).
pymssql is what you want, as a fellow data analyst (but really more a MI Developer now) I have around 150 business reports that pull from varieties of sql, mysql and postgres and all produced in pandas and output through various means
You can split a string into words with `str.split()`. Use `str.translate()` from the standard library instead of this manual loop. This question would be more appropriate to /r/learnpython. This is the news and discussion subreddit.
To try to make it short: Expression language is useful if you do some massive meta-programming, where you need to dynamically build queries, and you cannot just have a set of predefined ones. ORM is a failed concept that didn't stand the test of time. Once, when object were all the rage, every technology had to do something object-y, that's how ORM happened. The first 80% were kind of easy, but the remaining 20% first turned into yet another 80%, then 800%, then 8000%. Bottom line, it doesn't work, and unlikely ever will. As for `select`, I don't know the details, but this is how it can be done: in `sqlalchemy.sql.selectable.py`: def select(self, *args): pass in `sqlalchemy/__init__.py`: from .sql import selectable class Table: select = selectable.select And there's a ton of other ways to get the same effect. Why did they do it? Ambitious meta-programming with a lot of patches and stitches, duct tape and crutches. That basically explains how any Python library happened...
Thanks, that's not a bad suggestion!
Telegram client for python was outdated? If that is the case don't want to be rude, good job, but you could have helped updating the existing one instead of building a new butchered version.
To be fair it's not Python doing the heavy-lifting but most likely a combination of C, C++ and Fortran wrapped with Python. 
My job is to write python code, it will be long time before I can automate that.
&gt; On the other hand, most of my actual work automation happens on VBA. It's a painful language to write in compared to Python, but it's still the most practical use for existing business processes. A redditor mentioned [xlwings](https://www.xlwings.org/) for switching from VBA to python.
I automated a few tasks. But I feel specially proud of one because it saves me a lot of hassle. I have to make a monthly report. It's basically to surf some websites, taking screenshots, add them to the report and fill some tables with dozen of different entries. The python script visits all websites, resize them, takes the screenshot and saves it automatically. Also It takes the data from JSON files and format it automatically. So a one working day report can be done in 30 min now.
Thanks, that's a very clear example
Read the docs, https://docs.python.org/2/library/itertools.html#itertools.permutations. focus on the r parameter...
You can [use \`itertools.combinations\_with\_replacement\`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.combinations_with_replacement) \- it allows replacement (i.e. that the drawn number is placed back into the bin after drawing it). Added in python 3.1.

So the Python is learning Spanish for you?
There isn't a single language that ticks all boxes. CL and Prolog are good in the sense they are very small languages that build from first principles. Forth is good too in this sense. They are also interesting as a challenge, in a sense that they allow you to think about more ambitious questions, like, how to I solve a problem X in general, rather then how Python would normally make you think about how to solve the problem for here and now, the first 80%, in the best case... J is interesting as brainteaser. I don't know of any practical language that would give satisfactory correctness and ability to utilize your system properties. Some had a shot, like ML or Ada. Mercury and Rust are interesting projects. Unfortunately, it seems that the CS field in general grew too afraid of asking general questions and trying to solve general problems, all that is happening today is some kind of micro-optimizations in areas that are already know to be non-starters...
I might be confused here, but the online demo tries to talk to localhost:3000?

Yeah it's not Python itself doing the work, it's Python conveniently glueing the data sources with the data processors in a way that's easy to manipulate and play with.
I absolutely agree. It's the Intel MKL library behind the scenes. But you get the idea.

Last week I finished my bot's version pre-alpha 0.2.00, and this week I'm fixing the errors and finalizing pa0.2.01 for the bug fixes Other than bug fixes, I'm starting to collect my thoughts on /u/pythonHelperBot and organize it into a large writeup about the build process and research it explores. It's not much of a programming change, but it's time to take stock of the bot and where I want it to grow, and what tests I'll need to pass before new features are added, or classifiers are swapped out. It'll also survey research in related areas so I have a list ready for the times when I go "I wonder if I could do x, what are the common ways x is done, what limitations can I expect, and how does it perform?" 
I think pilots have huge discounts at the airline they work for, so they only need to check in at one company. It will be a nightmare to write a script to check in at all the different airlines. 
Thaks bro. I’m following you on github. Good luck in your path. 
Cool, I'll check it out, thanks for the tips!
Its really cool! Now I am able to write much cleaner code, while using the existing python libraries at the same time. It also has a jupyter kernel such that I can do interactive programming / data exploration... excellent!
When I an writing/testing/debugging a module I often use ipython, then I can %run -n path/to/module and it executes the code in the ipython namespace instead of importing it. If I make any changes I then `%run` it again to get the new version. 
I'm in the exact same boat, VBA, Python, Selenium, and all. My job is so boring now :(
TV Weather reporter, obviously.
&gt; By definition, a decorator is a function that allows us to wrap another function in order to extend the behavior of the wrapped function Not true! Decorators: 1. Don't need to be functions 2. Don't need to take functions 3. Don't need to return functions. What's really occurring is that @d def x(): ... is just syntax sugar for: def x(): ... x = d(x) , where `d` can be any callable object. See https://github.com/hchasestevens/hchasestevens.github.io/blob/master/notebooks/the-decorators-they-wont-tell-you-about.ipynb for more information.
Every few years someone comes out with a tool to do this and they are quickly barraged by the airlines to stop, so I don’t want to make it public, but the gist of it is that it scans my email for flight confirmations and creates a cron job on the rpi for when to check in.

Hi. So how did you solve it? I just did something on the same note but I'm having a problem when accessing from Windows. No problem if you want to see the whole code but the brief summary is in this post: /r/nginx/comments/agbspq/different_results_on_linuxworkswindowshalfnot/
&gt;I'd like a review on it please :) It does what you would expect, but it's pointless. All you're doing is accessing the coinbase API to retrieve exchange rates. A lot of online services do this better. If you're new at Python and trying to learn, then I would understand why you would want to share your success.
Hi, can I have a question? Did it work even for Windows without a problem? Or do you have a mix with Linux and Windows. I have a problem with almost the same setup and... Don't know how to solve it. I would be gracious for any experiences. /r/nginx/comments/agbspq/different_results_on_linuxworkswindowshalfnot/

I actually believe the domain logic in a complex rpg is more involved than 3d engine code. But I do agree that Pygame isn't the right technology for the engine.
Oh, no problem, my bad. Just wanted to point out that you should always try to help first if your idea is similar than trying to re-invent the wheel. 
Dependency injection, or an IoC container, is about dynamic late binding. Python is already a dynamic language, so late binding already exists out of the box. Typically, DI/IoC thinking tends to rely on two points: 1. separation of concerns, in which the caller doesn't need to know the details of what its calling. This is a fallacy in practice, IMO, because the caller _always_ needs to know some details of what its calling. For example, if you're making an external service request, its not up to the caller to execute a retry, isn't it? Its up to the client making the call to specify that, which means the client needs to know more details about the service. 2. Easy injection of fakes/mocks for tests. Python has `unittest.mock.patch` in the stdlib which allows for easily mocking and patching any resource for tests. In addition, there are a number of other mocking/patching libs to extend beyond the stdlib, dependent on your needs.

Steal it is not the right word if it was programmed during working hours.
Also look into the flask SQLAlchemy extension which makes working with the db very easy.
Of course it does. The whole point of pathlib is to be platform agnostic. 
I tried but the QTdesigner wouldnt let me, i just fixed it adding layouts, thanks though :)
Needs more documentation - I didn't manage to find out what it actually did!
Why do you have an issue with that when you wouldn't with `ignore_path = 'directory/.gitignore'`?
To be fair it's not C, C++ and Fortran doing the heavy-lifting, but the assembly that they compile to.
If you don't see that then you're very simple minded.
Well the problem here is that it could potentially be programmed anywhere at any time. So I'm implying yes it could be stolen rather than implying the company owns it.
So let me get this straight. You want all of the 3-length permutations, of a list of length 2? And you think the python standard library is the problem?
Meh I pretty much only fly with one airline these days anyhow. And it's a one where the earlier you check in, the earlier you get to board 
Something like this: from itertools import permutations def perm(list,r=1): items = [] for num in set(list): items.extend([num]*r) return set(permutations(items,r))
I know that, but what I said covers 90% of the use-cases, so I thought that would be the best way to introduce the readers. I just added some notes at the end of the article mentioning some of these points. BTW your article is great! I linked to it at the end of my article.
Wrapping and compilation are not the same thing.
But can't you just use default values inside your constructor?
ignore_path = Path(os.path.join(directory, '.gitignore')) # :P 
 def posneg(n) return -n Isn’t this implementation a bit simpler than yours?
I just started python, this would be interesting to know aswell
Great article. One quick question for you, once you decorate a function can it be called without the decoration or is it permanently modified?
Well there are at least 6 tools that allow it - https://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/6-tools-that-schedule-instagram-business-posts/ I think what they really want is for you to use an approved tool to do it to prevent abuse.
But domain logic isn't computationally intense, and python is good enough for that part. For rendering alone there are opengl bindings, and since rendering is done by the gpu, python's slowness is irrelevant. But for a 3D game there's a lot of linear algebra involved, which is done in software, and that's where python would be a little short. You could try numpy for that part, but it would still be much easier to skip all the wrapping and just write it in C++ (or rust, we're in 2019). 
It sounds as if what you want is a cartesian product: &gt;&gt;&gt; list(itertools.product([1,3], repeat=3)) [(1, 1, 1), (1, 1, 3), (1, 3, 1), (1, 3, 3), (3, 1, 1), (3, 1, 3), (3, 3, 1), (3, 3, 3)]

I'm talking about the case where you program it at work.
That's just how I roll bby.
Look into Pipenv or Poetry.
Is it also available for mysql sir ?
It’s an ORM that supports MySQL, Postgres, and SQLite. It’s nice bc your code doesn’t have to change if you change db backends. So you could develop using SQLite and then deploy to production using MySQL.

I read a bit here: &lt;[https://realpython.com/pipenv-guide/](https://realpython.com/pipenv-guide/)\&gt;, Pipenv always tracks the last available version unless instructed otherwise? Answer in that case would be "always the latest version". Thanks.
No, Pipenv locks your dependency versions, and then they're "frozen" in a sense that running `pipenv install` again will give you the exact same configuration. You can then run `pipenv update` to update the versions of your dependencies.
```shell sudo land plane --soft ``` Because we live in a civilization
Some of these functions are nice to have, but any function that is a single, simple line is unnecessary in my opinion. `even`, `odd`, `positive`, `negative`, `zero`, and `posneg` if rewritten as /u/XNormal shows are all simple and obvious and having the implementation hidden in a function isn't really of benefit. To be perfectly honest, this looks like something that I'd expect in a `npm` module. Implementation of simple routines. Part of why JavaScript actually needs those things is because the language itself lacks the ability to concisely and simply make those determinations. Most of the time, they are unnecessary in other languages as they tend to be more explicit in the first place.
I've read a lot of stuff on decorators, and I always had a bit of difficulty to fully wrap my mind around the concept. But in your article, there's one sentence that should be used in every explanation of decorators: &gt;a decorator is a function that allows us to wrap another function With this as a starter, it is much easier to understand the whole picture. Thank you very much for your article!
Your example is consistent with any other variable being assigned a value and I have no problem with that. In the example I gave the `/` operator is acting as `+ '/'`. It's really not a big problem, it is just weird to see that in Python since Python doesn't allow operator overloading.
I love pathlib!
likely because `/` is almost always an arithmetic operator used for division of numbers.
Well then we have different scenarios and I see no problem with that. Sorry for the misunderstanding.
Not a big one, but at my job, I have to send in a weekly report to my boss, with a list of whatever I plan on working on the following week. It's annoying because it's our jobs list is already available in one of our intranet pages. So every Monday I have to grab the ones I will be working on, and copy/paste into a Word document, with some details about it (when it should be done, what parts are already done, etc). It's currently a work in progress, but I'm trying to automate that, so I don't "forget" about it anymore.
Nothing fancy but, my wife needed to query a database for data almost every night and save it to CSV to import it into another program. So, to save her some slack time, I wrote a stored procedure in SQL server that has a date parameter then wrote a python script to execute that SP while passing it today's date programmatically, export the required date for the day to CSV and save the file while appending the file name with the run date. I scheduled it to run using a .bat file and windows scheduler.
Saved. Thanks!

Python library for making terminal programs
For the most part, open source projects are *not* looking for contributors who don't already know what needs doing. There usually aren't a ton of shovel-ready tasks lying around that an inexperienced dev can do, because by the time a task reaches that state, an experienced contributor will just do it, and that's less work than reviewing someone else's PR. To be valuable your PRs need to address actual needs of the project, and fix them in ways that don't create extra burden for the current developers. If you want to work on open-source projects, I would encourage you to do your own hobby projects, either on your own or with friends. Use open source projects written by other people. When you see something that needs fixing, fix it, and submit a PR! As an actual user you're much more likely to understand the needs of the project, and to be able to generate a useful fix. Once you've made a PR or two to the same project, congratulations, you're a contributor!
&gt; ... and now just cruise Ha ha ha.... There's always more :-) &amp;#x200B;
To be fair, it's not the compiled assembly doing the heavy-lifting, but the actual hardware it runs on.
TIL Python 3 has been out for roughly 10 years
[Currying is actually something different but related](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currying): A curried function takes a single argument and either returns the result of the original function or another curried function, depending on whether the function has enough arguments. A very simple example of currying in Python would be: from typing import Callable, Any, Union from inspect import Parameter, signature from dataclasses import dataclass @dataclass class Curried: function: Callable arg_count: int arguments: tuple def __call__(self, value: Any) -&gt; 'Union[Curried, Any]': arguments = self.arguments + (value,) if len(arguments) &lt; self.arg_count: return Curried(self.function, self.arg_count, arguments) return self.function(*arguments) def curry(f): sig = signature(f) assert all(p.kind == Parameter.POSITIONAL_OR_KEYWORD for p in sig.parameters.values()) return Curried(f, len(sig.parameters), ()) For any function `f`, you can call `curry(f)` to get a curried version that takes a single argument and only calls `f` if it has enough arguments, otherwise it returns another curried function.
Sure does look like a lot (or all) of your practice exercise are from a well known Udemy teahcers Python 3 course
Instagram normie why 
Hey, sorry it took so long to reply to you, but it would be awesome if you could help out! [Here is a CSV file](http://www.sharecsv.com/s/44597b8978d492e45ed2ffffcad04e4e/query_result.csv) I uploaded online which contains about 2k (x, y) coordinates which is a subset of the data I am trying to graph.
Decorators do not bind to the function called. One of the advantages of using decorators is to dynamically alter the original behavior of a function, therefore, it wouldn't make sense for it to permanently attach. Because then implementing the decorator logic inside of the function itself would be a lot easier and would ultimately achieve the same result. I am not the OP, but hopefully I was able to shed a light on this.
Thanks! And I don't think you can. It's permanently modified.
You're welcome! Yes I didn't want to jump headlong into the details, wanted to start slow so that the reader doesn't get overwhelmed. Glad that approach helped.
ha love it
He did an [interview on Talk Python To Me](https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/167/simplifying-python-s-async-with-trio) that is really interesting as well. I think he covers a lot his criticisms there as well. And here's [a link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLkfnc_UMcE) to his PyCon talk about Trio that shows the Happy Eyeballs problem live.
There may be some weirdness with certain subnormal floats or values like "negative zero", but I don't have any confidence that this library is handling them more correctly. If it needed to be done this way, it would need a ton of documentation pointing back to the IEEE specifications to actually explain why it had to be this way.

&gt; Python 3.0 (also called "Python 3000" or "Py3K") was released on December 3, 2008. **ಠ_ಠ**
Well finally 
992 years too early.
I don't deserve it, darling you look so perfect 
Progress is achieved similarly to the way the fibonacci sequence is constructed. You build on top of what you previously achieved. Python 3 is truly an amazing piece of software. And let's not forget it's predecessors, the community and everybody who contributed. Here's to 10 more! 
I think the biggest problem with pathlib is that it isn't opinionated enough. This is demonstrated by the variety of ways in which one can construct and manipulate path objects, but actually goes a bit deeper. Pathlib allows you to create certain paths which are technically valid according to the posix standard such as `'foo\\bar\tbaz'`. Which is bat-shit crazy. Nobody should ever have cause to create such a path, and a good library should complain. However you have to [jump through hoops](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45724240/processing-non-utf-8-posix-filenames-using-python-pathlib) to get pathlib to create a path with raw control character from a bytes object... so what the fuck are they thinking? What was their opinion on exotic paths? Why does the library exist? The multitude of ways in which to construct paths is just a symptom of their unwillingness to have an opinion about what good paths are. They should have such an opinion, and their library should insist upon the user obeying the conventions about path-like objects. This includes restrictions on what characters will be allowed in paths, and expectations that filenames (as opposed to directory names) will have extensions, and all the good stuff we rely upon to make the broader software ecosystem work. Once you establish that you have an opinion about paths themselves, you can establish that you have an opinion about the syntax of their creation and manipulation. If your opinions are not in sync with the needs of developers, then your library will be a failure, but if it isn't opinionated at all then its just useless.
I notice two problems: 1. You don't need all the `if self.currency == ` statements. No matter what the currency is, you do the same thing. 2. The `try: except:` around your attempt to get the exchange rate won't do much. If the except clause is triggered, the `currentPrice` variable will be undefined and you'll get an error. 
Or 1,992 years too early. Could have been launched on 12/3/4k.
Your response is very good, thank you for the advice

Out of curiosity, what was your motivation for writing this? Just a learning experience? How does it differ from what is available in the standard library (smtplib)?
Projects which are relevant to the filed where you are searching for jobs. Want a position in data science? Show your potential employers that you can do data science. Same for web dev, game dev, etc. I am a scientist. When evaluating the skills applicants I don't care if they can make a website. I want to see that they can do science. And the language they use is not that important for me.
No because I'm actually going to use different defaults. For instance weapon type one has ammo 3 and weapon type two has ammo 10.
&gt; What are some of the best projects to have in a portfolio? Completed ones??
That makes sense, but I doubt the company I’m applying at would want to see my Pokédex project that retrieves their pictures from bulbapedia
This is super easy to use compared to `smtplib`. It's a wrapper around `smtplib` and `email`, similar to something like https://github.com/lavr/python-emails for instance.
Hey, that is still one. ;) Don't forget, the last FlappieBirds iPhone sold for over $100k and Poke'mon Go had kids jumping off of bridges.
And Python 2 is still the default in many Linux distributions. 
Yup I used Colt Steele Python3 Course found it really helpful. I didn't really do the practice exercises 
&gt; Not necessarily: python can do blazingly fast things on matrixes. That really doesn't address my point. I wasn't saying anything about how good python is. It's great. I was just pointing out that 1000 matches in 15 minutes is not indicative of a problem with VBA, but rather with novice programming. VBA is a great entry level programming language and it gets a lot of undeserved shit for the code that beginners and otherwise non technical people write. 
Did you credit him somewhere?
Huh, okay. I always found smtplib really easy to use, but I'll check yours out further. (Not intended as bragging, but I also have 15 years professional experience running mail servers, so what is easy/obvious for me is not always for others. It wouldn't surprise me if you're able to provide a more complete/cleaner abstraction. smtplib does kinda expect you to know how email works.)
Won't python 3 be replaced in the next three years? 3.8 this year, 3.9 next and then 4.0? How will the python maintainers avoid another shit storm like python2/3?
“Standard”? You mean “What gets invoked when I type `python` into the terminal”? That’ll never change in some distros, because of backwards compatibility. Arch was pretty much the only one ~~crazy~~brave enough to to that jump, Debian will never do it. What’s so hard about typing `python3` or putting `alias python=python3` into your `.${SHELL}rc`?
By symlinking python3 to python4. It’s not going to be nearly as big changes as the python2→python3 transition.
What I wanted was to get rid of boilerplate, that's the purpose of libraries isn't it? After I wrote most of the code I found out that there has been a new version of the `email` library in Python 3.6 that kinda does what I did in this project—abstracting away the MIME structure—but I still went ahead and completed it. 
&gt; That’ll never change in some distros, because of backwards compatibility. 10 years on, I think we can move along. https://pythonclock.org/
After 3.9 there’ll be 3.10, IMAO
Hey, a new hope
END OF LINE
And people are still using 2.7. 10 years has been enough time to switch! Also isn’t 4.0 looming ?
Try posting to /r/learnpython or the python discord, see the sidebar for more information.
Looking at the example code in the README.md on github, two things jump out: 1) That looks like a much easier way to send attachments 2) The example provided has no (text part) message body. Since the "typical" use case will likely include a message body, rather than just headers and attachments, it would likely be a good idea to update that example to include same. I'll be happy to try it out and offer feedback.
It’s not hard but maintaining two versions of python isn’t. Debian and Ubuntu do it well bit it would be nice to have only one. It would make things much less complicated. For those that really still have legacy python 2 code they could use aliases to keep it running. I have to believe they’re the minority these days. I could be wrong, I guess. 
Thank you! Great article!
I'm building a Flask app that uses the Spotify API to make music recommendations for my friends and family. Kind of feel like I'm re-inventing the wheel but I'm new to Python and it's helping me learn!
There's nothing wrong with it. That guy proved a need to further invest in software. He did the hardest job.
&gt; BAN any commenter giving advice in these threads. Way to boost the reputation of the python community. Here's a thought for people overwhelmed by the S/N ratio: sort by upvotes. If that's too much to ask, maybe take a freaking break.
That's not how version number generally work. No reason not to have 3.10.0, other than compatibility for code that assumes there is only one digit between the dots. We are on GNOME 3.30.2, Linux 4.20.1, numpy 1.15.4, why not Python 3.10.0?
I think + for strings was fine back in, like, 2.6, but I think a hypothetical Python 4 should dump it, because f-strings, `str.format` and `str.join` honestly could completely replace + for strings.
&gt; Nobody should ever have cause to create such a path, How about accessing existing files with such a name that were created by accident? In fact, I've had exactly that use case, and it's easier to deal with in a real language than with bash. If it's legal, it should be accepted, full stop. 
&gt; Python doesn't allow operator overloading. t most certainly does. https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#special-method-names

There is documentation, you have to click through a couple of times, but it's hard to find and not very extensive. It's easier to read the source, IMO, because most of the defined functions are (near) trivial anyway.
Use the `os` library. `os` isn't going away, and it will accept raw bytes and won't do any further validation on top of what you ask it to do.
Oh IDK what went wrong there _was_module docs in the readthedocs website, but now there isn't. Some new commit must've broke it. Thanks for the heads up!

While I don't like either library, I will say that I respect that pyfilesystem seems to have a real opinion about how it is supposed to be used. In particular with regard to this notion that one would use context managers to regulate access to the filesystem. That is a manner of thinking that is foreign to most developers, and it does lead to bugs and security issues. So I respect that pyfilesystem seems to have this as a core concept. What exactly is the core concept of `pathlib` that distinguishes if from `os.path`?
I believe Guido's of the opinion that 3.9 should be followed by 4.0, purely for aesthetic reasons, so it's likely that'll happen. Although the core developers generally agree that if that happens, then 3.9 -&gt; 4.0 will not have major breaking changes, in the way that 2.x -&gt; 3.0 did.
Or 2559 years too early. Could have been released on 12/3/4567
If you've got a big enterprise code base (and I'm currently working with a client that does), then it can be difficult to fix old code faster than the team is writing new code - especially since there's only usually budget for the latter.
Should I be able to create a Path for a file called `'CON'`, `'NUL'`, `'AUX'`, `'COM1.txt'` etc? Because [those are invalid filenames on Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/FileIO/naming-a-file). (With extensions it seems like it might be possible to create those files, but they still discourage it.)
Oh, neat! I needed to override `and` once and couldn't figure out how to do it so I just assumed it wasn't possible on the other operators as well.

I think as you’re learning things, reinventing the wheel is more than acceptable, how else are you going to learn? You might also think, yes it’s already been done, but not quite how I want it to, so will change it slightly.
As someone who is relatively new to Python, should I make the effort to learn Python 2.7 syntax? Or should I stick to Python 3+?
Stick with 3. 
Stick to python 3. You will be able to import from the future if you really need to code in python 2, but it is usually easy to convert from 2 to 3.
No, that's about when we can finally assume it's the default, rather than Python2.
Thank god. I thought you are a pilot who flies the plane with scripts on your RasPI
`fib` is usually the name of a function that names the n-th Fibonacci number, not a function that checks whether or not n is a Fibonacci number. `nothing(x)` seems to be almost equivalent to `not x`, except that `nothing(math.nan)` is true and `nothing(x)` is false for most types of `x`, like empty sets and user-defined classes that define a `__bool__`. `fracsimplify(n, n)` returns the string`"1/1"`, while in other cases it returns a two-element list. The whole function could be replaced with: from fractions import Fraction def fracsimplify(numerator, denominator): frac = Fraction(numerator, denominator) return [frac.numerator, frac.denominator] You also don't need to call `bool` on things that are already of type `bool` or _ever_ use `bool` like this: `if bool(...):` because `if` _already_ converts the condition to a boolean. `num` excludes numbers that aren't `int` or `float`. Also, I don't think you should swallow a `RuntimeError` here. You could replace it with: from numbers import Number def num(x): return isinstance(x, Number) `flipcoords` takes two numbers and an axis label and returns... a string. When is that useful? It's also overcomplicated. I would probably write it as follows: def flipcoords(x, y, axis): axis = axis.lower() if axis == 'x': return -x, y if axis == 'y' return x, -y raise ValueError("Invalid axis. Neither x nor y was specified.") `hcf` is usually called the greatest common denominator, or `math.gcd`. `lcm` is more efficiently implemented as: def lcm(a, b): if a == b == 0: return 0 return abs(a * b) // math.gcd(a, b) You really don't need `ready`. Instead of adding license info as a string, consider adding to the top of the module: # Copyright (c) 2019 Richie Bendall # # Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy # of this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal # in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights # to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell # copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is # furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions: # # The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all # copies or substantial portions of the Software. # # THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR # IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, # FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

My friend works in finance. 1000 matches in 15 minutes is not a smoking gun.
Perhaps priorities will change when there are no security patches.
If the intent of the library is to be a cross-platform tool that would ensure that a program written for one system can be run on the other, then the answer seems clear to me: "No you should not allow or use reserved Windows/DOS filenames on Unix" (and vice versa). Its really all about your intent here. If your intent is to only support unix... just use byte arrays and split them on "/". I don't see any need for a new library. If your intent is to be friendly to modern desktop users across Windows/Unix (including Linux/Android/Apple), there are a host of restrictions you must place on your filenames. Or perhaps pathlib sees a different problem with file management. Another post in /r/python pointed out how pyfilesystem uses context managers to control access to folders and try to "sandbox" programs (to a limited extent) to their folders. I don't know what problem pathlib is trying to solve. Is its only purpose to ensure that you split the path with the correct character? That's only a half-step towards cross-platform compatibility, it hardly seems worth pushing a whole library just because of it. 
It's not the implementation, no. It's just how it's displayed.
`math.acos` will only return numbers between -1 and 1 so this means your `np.dot` is returning something smaller or larger than that.

&gt; Debian will never do it. RHEL 8 is doing it: https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2018/11/14/python-in-rhel-8/. I am sure Debian will do it sooner or later too.
Thank god. Deciding whether a version bump should be major or minor based on “aesthetic reasons” would be beyond moronic. 
You haven't really said what you're going to do with the data once it's in python so it will be hard for anyone to give you a solid answer. There is nothing inherently dangerous if you're only 'processing' data.
Yes and no. From what I've gathered Python 3.10==4.0. as in, there won't be any real major changes for 4.0, not bigger than previous dot releases. The Python 3.7 doc does mention 4.0 a few times, and that's the only official information I've found, so what I said above might not be correct, or just be the initial intention that might change. But it general, there seems to be no reason to fear a shit storm when 4.0 releases. The biggest problem would probably be code that made the mistake of explicitly checking for 3 and not &gt; 2 or != 2. I went through all of our modules at work when I heard about 4.0 to correct such mistakes.
The Python 3.7 doc does mention 4.0 a few times, it looks like the current plan is to call 3.10 4.0. But that might of course change. Just make sure you don't do sys.version_info.major == 3 just in case
I've lived to see the day that my low cost catering events are better than the ones offered by the President. Dankest timeline.
I moved on long ago, but some people have different ideas about backwards compatibility. And the fact that using “python” simply worked for those 10 years didn't help people to start using the more correct “python2”
Hm, interesting. But he's left Python now hasn't he? Regardless, Python 3.7 doc does mention 4.0 a few times
Have been working on my Flask-based personal website, basically a blog and future portfolio. Finally managed to deploy a first draft today after wrangling with my shared hosting (surprisingly there are not many tutorials out there on how to deploy a Flask app via cPanel.) Planning to go over the frontend again in the next few days with a focus on accessibility and maybe also iron out some cross-browser compatibility issues.
I need it to be a glorified excel spreadsheet. Take some columns, tell it to do some shit with the columns, and give me new columns. By using pandas or anaconda could anyone else potentially have access to the data by virtue of using those applications?
Ha, that's a very well reasoned approach!

He has [given himself a permanent vacation from being BDFL](https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-committers/2018-July/005664.html), but e.g. [he's currently nominating](https://discuss.python.org/t/steering-council-nomination-guido-van-rossum/628) for Python steering council. I guess technically whoever gets elected could decide to go for 4.0, but I think most core devs agree 3.10 makes sense.

I imagine you're doing something recursive.. Maybe you could add a variable to keep track of the depth/node and use that to ensure proper matches
The first large migrations seemed to start with 3.3 or 3.4, so 2012 or 2014.
This sounds awesome. Are you using an ETL lib like airflow?
This is a recipe for technical debt that will eventually put you with an output level of zero. All new code should be written compatible with 3. Each module you touch should be made compatible. This allows slow migration to 3.
Sorry, didn't mean to return the error... it was an honest question.
And I honestly answered it.
you need to install python 3 and on the installer it will say add path variable. you need to check that box. then you can install. to run the project you just open the command line and run “python yourproject.py”, the python variable can by py python3 or python. the easiest way to check is by typing python -V, python3-v, ect
there are also python extensions for vscode so you can debug in the terminal on screen
if you have a gpu why don't you just use it? parallel programming is a whole different field, if you are using pandas to do large scale data analysis I would think you aren't prepared for systems level programming. Try to use gpu acceleration to speed up calculations.

It is recursive. I’m slowly figuring it out, but my issue is partly that I am trying to make it dynamic and be able to feed it any dictionary and have it work instead of a specific one.
That's overkill for Python, especially if you're just starting out. Don't get me wrong, it's a good starter setup for any computer. I do most of my Python coding on a Raspberry Pi, so...
Pandas is already doing parallelization. Actually, the way you wrote it, it's probably the best you can get from your setup, or, at least, it's close (maybe you can rewrite it like `data['x &lt; a &amp; x &gt; b ...']`). The parallelization Pandas is doing is known as SIMD (single instruction multiple data), it exploits special CPU instructions to process multiple datapoints at once (depending on the CPU architecture, it could be 4-8-16 or maybe even more computations at once), but it can also be the case that it does nothing on your CPU (you need to see what AVX / SSE instructions it supports). Very likely, Pandas already spreads the load to all cores, so, adding more threads to it won't help either. I believe that NumPy (which is used by Pandas under the hood) comes with support for GPU computation out of the box on Linux, and if you install it through `conda`, then it also does so on Windows. Your most likely problem with big dataset will be... you'll run out of memory. So, it won't be slow, it'll just crash. `dask` is the library that tries to do something like Pandas, but it can scale to multiple computers, so if you have access to a network of computers, which all can work together on your project, then, maybe try that.
Buy a computer to do other things. Any relatively modern computer is more than enough for Python development.
I'm working on training myself up (currently attending wgu and doing most of my coursework at work!!). Side hustle is a no currently, as school work takes up most of my time. 
The rule of thumb: never. Only in exceptional situation, like, a library fixed a bug I care about. Customer reported that the new version performs noticeably better to justify the update. Chasing random updates generates a lot of busy work that distracts from the actual work that the project needs to be doing.
I kid you not, programming doesn't require any specific specs. Basically any computer with a modern operating system (preference, not a hard requirement) runs Python and any other language just fine. If you build a computer, consider what else you'll be doing on it. Specs only help if you have a particularly intense workload, which is rarely the case. (One example would be programming and testing games that would have to run well, but that's not really where Python is used.)
I like this idea. 
I don't know what you're trying to say here.
First, this is better for /r/learnpython. But anyway, no! It is *displayed* as one and you can *create* it as one, but it's a mapping. For example, you can only have one value associated with a key, while a list of tuples would allow multiples. Also, lookup time is O(1) (at least for built-in dicts. I think it is for OrderedDict too). If you had to do a lookup through a list of tuples, it would be O(n). Also, there are lots of requirements on dictionary keys (they have to be hashable for example). A list of tuples does not have that either!
Great answer I did learn a lot. I Googled Reddit python had I know there was a learnpython I'd be there. Thanks for your reply nonetheless. Hit all the points to solidify my knowledge.
Visual studio is a pretty heavy choice, if you're just starting out then you could get away with a more lightweight ide or editor setup, but there's no problem whatsoever with what you've got. You wouldn't have a problem getting started with something like mariadb either. Keep using what you've got until you feel a reason to change it. Though, an ssd is always a great upgrade
Why not? Anything that shows your skills is good. It also tells much about you personally when you show a personal project. A potential employer can be like "You remember that one guy who had that awesome Pokemon app?".

Lol. Interesting finds, for sure. I stand by my statement but like any good engineer, I’m two minds on the issue, and another part of me says, “it’s a version string, who gives a shit, as long as they match when they need to” because while my first comment represented the ideal, your comment shows even the most famous projects can be laissez faire about versions and making any assumptions based on them would be equally moronic! Thanks for those nuggets!
Haha, that's great. What is the Elo of your chess engine?
You guys are awesome! :)
&gt;Discord What's this?
It's an online repository for open source programs. So you put your whole repository on there and people can download your python program. Have a Google of it. 
That sounds fun (just kidding)!
Actually for the ETL project it’s vanilla python with ldap3 library. It’s a quick win so I have not looked at other libs
&gt;What I want is an executable that's pinned to my taskbar and when opened will generate a console that runs this code. You can use [pyinstaller](http://www.pyinstaller.org/) to generate an executable. ``` pip install pyinstaller pyinstaller --onefile my_python_script.py ``` &gt;Also, is there a way to set a default "gen" value where if I skip the line "gen = input("What generation? options are RB, GS, RS, DP, BW, XY, SM ")" it'll just set a default value? What do you mean by skip? If you just mean the user provides blank input, then you could do the following (based on : ``` gen = input("What generation? options are RB, GS, RS, DP, BW, XY, SM ") or "MY_DEFAULT_VALUE" ``` (note: I'm assuming you're using python3?)
Damn....that's so much better than what I figured out. My XPath-fu sucks I guess. &amp;#x200B; Here's what I ended up coming up with (keep in mind this is the actual code not using the sample table. Searches for row with table header 230 then clicks the 3rd column): &amp;#x200B; table = driver.find_element_by_xpath('//*[@id="availability-table"]') rows = table.find_elements(By.TAG_NAME, "tr") for row in rows: try: lot_num = row.find_elements(By.TAG_NAME, "th")[0] except: continue pass if lot_num.text.strip() == '230': cols = row.find_elements(By.TAG_NAME, "td") cols[2].find_element_by_class_name('rec-availability-date').click() &amp;#x200B;

Pyspark dataframes could help if you have multiple machines 
You could use xlrd to read information from the existing spreadsheet. Separate each person and its contact info - how is the data separated in this specific cell? Then use xlwt to write the splitted/rearranged data to a new excel file.
There was a lot of effort put into these videos, and it is appreciated. Is there a text version of the content available anywhere? 
I have a non computer related job, I am a supervisor at a civil service job. My department assigns people to various locations. We have over 500 employees that get assigned daily, and most people hand edit their rosters using daily payroll data. The payroll data is unfortunately is only available as PDF, and on Windows. I wrote a parser that could take that PDF (oh what a nightmare) and reorganizes it into the required roster format. Whereas it takes my fellow supervisors at least an hour daily to complete this task, I do it in five minutes, giving me a little kick back time.
Ooohh boy, looks like you're one of today's lucky 10,000! The Linux kernel is a special case. Usually the difference between major and minor version bumps has to do with backwards compatibility. However, it is the strict policy of the Linux kernel that kernel updates NEVER EVER break backwards compatibility with userspace programs, so that scheme doesn't have much merit. Interesting links: [Linus goes on expletive filled rant when one of his kernel maintainers suggests breaking backwards compatibility](https://lkml.org/lkml/2012/12/23/75) [Why is there a Linux kernel policy to never break user space?](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/235335/why-is-there-a-linux-kernel-policy-to-never-break-user-space)
So each contact is separes by a semicolon, how do I separate them? 
I can't agree with that more. I had to improve on a report generated by using Excel VBA, and the mess that the original coder had there... was just mind blowing. And the amount of his crap that was hidden by "On Error Resume Next"... I had written full programs in my teens using VB5 and 6... I can probably count on on hand how many times I've used "On Error (Resume|Goto) ..." It is capable of great things if you know how to use it.
You can use split to do this. Here is a short example: https://stackoverflow.com/a/6962425
Well, visual studio is known for being relatively heavy. Assuming you're on windows, something like notepad++, atom, visual studio code, even PyCharm community may be lighter. There are plenty of ides out there like eric, thonny, wing, etc
&gt; pip install pyinstaller pyinstaller --onefile my_python_script.py I don't know what this means. &gt;gen = input("What generation? options are RB, GS, RS, DP, BW, XY, SM ") or "MY_DEFAULT_VALUE" Thanks! :D
Those are commands to run in a command prompt on your machine. The first one, `pip install pyinstaller`, will download and installer the pyinstaller package. The second one, `pyinstaller --onfile my_python_script.py`, will create a single executable that contains a python interpreter and all appropriate dependencies for your script. You can then take that executable and run it. Perhaps you'd be better served by going to /r/learnpython for this. 
Unless you get paid to learn/use 2, use 3.
DUUUUUDE. This is so cool!! Thanks! I'm confused as all hell on how that actually worked. Why was the cmd prompt able to understand what pip install pyinstaller even meant? 
Working through a tutorial on flask (I haven’t made a web app for years) and solving problems on project Euler. Want to start making contributions to open source projects as well but not sure what. 
How does NumPy come with GPU support? I haven't seen anything about that. I know of CuPy, which aims to be a drop in replacement for NumPy on the GPU, but I haven't seen anything about GPU NumPy. As for using multiple cores with NumPy, you need MKL for that (at least for lost computations). Whenever I've benchmarked NumPy code without MKL, it doesn't utilise all cores properly. 
| inputs what is entered in by the user (a persons name) into the search bar Doing a search requires sending the name as an input to the search form target using a POST request, or a "GET" request with the name as a url-encoded parameter.

When you install Python, there are some utilities that come preinstalled. Running `pip install` points to a script installed by Python that is on your system path. You can get the same results by running `python -m pip install` instead. On my machine, I have Python installed at `C:\Program Files\Python36` and I can find the actual `pip` executable at `C:\Program Files\Python36\Scripts\pip.exe`.
Check out codingbat.com 
so is the whole purpose of pip.exe to convert a .py file to an .exe file?

I just wish I had started learning it 10 years ago!
Yes, pretty much. It manages how the .py file(s) are put into a distributable package. The `--onefile` argument tells it to bundle everything (interpreter, dependencies, actual script) into one file instead of having it split. 
Is there a syntax formatting option for this sub? Sort of like they have in markdown? It would help a lot

Trying, for the life of me, to create a neat little Flask powered web application which converts inputted audio to “8D”/ambisonic. Having issues. A challenge is good here and there :)
I'd be interested in this. We could even practice version control with git and create push requests, etc. 
Ridiculous, it's too late, the world ended 21/12/2012
I'll take a look, thanks
The shit storm was not due to numbering change from 2 to 3. It was because of breaking backward compatibility. Guido and team thought that developers would be as excited and interested as them (and have the time and resources) in upgrading existing python2 code to the new and improved python 3. Wrong assumption. No one upgraded unless they absolutely needed to... and one way was to make python 3 much better than 2.
Better to start with 3... and if you ever need to learn it, python 2 has very few differences when compared to 3. 
The good ones are on the right!! 
I have to, ROS still uses Python 2. ROS 2 is here but it doesn't have big enough of community.
I've only ever used it in the interpreter while actively working on code.
How are you learning it? And do you use IDE or anything? Looking to start learning python as it is becoming and already is such a powerful language 
Some are even quit regularly used, especially the `__call__()` and comparison operators.
I was actually able to figure it out!! Thanks for the help!!!
Static methods are useful for abstract/unimplemented methods that will be implemented within the same class. It sounds weird, but there is a time and place to do that. For example, if you want to make a single-dispatched method, the base method can be a static method that just raises a `NotImplemented` or `TypeError` exception, and it can register regular methods that do access the object's state.
To be fair it's not the hardware, it's electrons running around
Would you say this is a good book for someone who just finished a begginer’s level textbook that covered a lot of the basics?
f-strings don't support things like starred expressions. I do use them whenever I can, though.
Write a script-based CRUD application. Then make it web-based.
I really wanted to master curses, it looks so amazing, but I could never get started. Might have to try it again. It’s a peculiar library to initiate with. 
Also, using `numpy` or `pandas` to process very large amounts of data instead of using generators. RAM can sometimes be more of a bottleneck than the CPU. For very small programs, I try to keep memory usage under 10mb; for substantial programs, under 50mb; for large programs, under 125mb; for apps with user interfaces, under 200mb. I've found that these numbers are pretty good self-imposed limits to help me decide whether to use np arrays or generators/iterators.
I encourage you to give it a try. The docs for curses are very good. If you have any specific questions feel free to ask in r/learnpython or something and I'll answer if I can.
Here's some useless code I've just written. from time import sleep print("\033c") while 1: for x in 'VIVE LA FRANCE': print(x) sleep(.05) sleep(.5) print("\033c") 
Thanks for the book, but could you upload it in Epub/mobi format aswell? Its far more convenient to use, even on a PC.

Virgin 2.7 vs Chad 3
And as a freelancer I've been hired to resolve some of those very same issues that you speak of. There's a lot of different factors at play in the software development cycle, and there is such a thing as overthinking your code. 
Yeah this solution is itself a "patch" functionality in the first place, the customer needed something yesterday to deliver to a client that needed it the day before that. The entire thing was supposedly going to be scrapped for "a properly developed in-house solution" (his words, actually), 2 years ago. Checked in with them a few months ago, it's still chugging along. 
All the operators and methods of the path class would return normal paths, not your custom pathstring hybrid. So if it worked it would be mostly useless. 
On a basic level, Python is not much different than VB - it’s a bytecode running on a VM. Critical parts of Python a DLLs written in pure C, so that’s also an advantage. General purpose language capable of pursuing general purposes, yeah. Maybe you’re asking something more specific to the development process? Python can kill you with a runtime exception any time, so you have to be careful and catch ’em all. And duck typing will stab you here in the back (Python 3 allows to be more ’typey’). Although great reflective features built-in in Python will help here. Moreover, every conceivable development tool like profiling or TDD suites is there for you. Free powerful IDEs like PyCharm or VSC are nice to have. Virtual environments will curb dependencies. What else… 
Yeah, you're totally right, I've used `__call__`, and a few others but I guess I wasn't really thinking of those as 'operators'. I was playing around with it earlier today and couldn't figure out how to overload the multiply operator to have different behaviors depending on which type was passed like you can in C++. It seems like for this to work I'd need to implement some conditionals in the `__mul__` method that check the types first. Is that right? For instance: `Color(255.100,100) * .25` and `Color(100,100,100) * Color(0,0,0,.5)`

Follow this advice. &amp;#x200B; You can program on a crappy netbook from 05 if you just plan on learning. &amp;#x200B; When you need to do data analysis/game design or anything that requires more than 2gb of memory, then you should consider a heavier duty machine.
Sublime Text, Notepad++, IDLE. &amp;#x200B; Want some respek on your name? Vim. &amp;#x200B; Want to actually get work done? &amp;#x200B; Nano. &amp;#x200B; Want something inbetween but's probably fancier than both? &amp;#x200B; Emacs. &amp;#x200B; Want to start a flame war? &amp;#x200B; Pick one and claim its the best.
None that I use. None anyone should use. Sure some LTS release. If the distro can't update python after 10 years (in there latest stable release) they can't competently maintain a distro. And you shouldn't rely on them to be doing anything right.
Yep, that's how it's usually done. Also, you need to define `__rmul__` as well if you want to do: .25 * Color(255.100,100) To be honest, it can get a bit tedious, but when you have a good use case for custom operators, they tend to make code so much cleaner that it's absolutely worth it.
Awesome, Hit me with a PM :)
We're talking about 2.7 here, right? Because that's what I mean.

A lot of the time they are sticking with python2.7 as `python` because their OSs run legacy systems that may make assumptions about what `python` means. That's a reasonable assumption to have been made before python3 came out. What if Debian decided tomorrow that `cd` is a horrible way to change directories and decided to come up with a new command `dir` and then removed `cd`! That would be really dumb and people would be pissed off because Debian is making their OS less stable and friendly to long term systems. If I had to double check to make sure Debian didn't remove dependencies before I installed every security patch I'd either not patch or switch from Debian to something better like Windows (jk Arch)
Thank you!
It's gotten better recently. He realized he was being unprofessional and that his behavior was driving away both current kernel developers and potential kernel developers. So he took a 1 month break from all kernel development, saw a professional about his behavior, and added an email filter so he can't swear anymore.
Tried it today following your guide -- Python 3.5.3 does not have good support between `os` and `pathlib` (or `shutil` for that matter). Not good enough, gunna stick with the old ways for now.
There is no difference between a program and a script. Anyway, Python is more than capable of handling your described usage. 
Wow, now I have to reconsider my tool choice I made 20 years ago. /s

Oh. Please open a PR in the repo so I can attribute you.
&gt;How does NumPy come with GPU support It doesn't. It comes with vectorization. \&gt; As for using multiple cores with NumPy, you need MKL for that Which is why you use Anaconda's version of numpy/python.
Yup
There's probably easier ways but pandas you can read the csv in and use xlsxwriter to write it back out.
Can't think of an easier way. 
Maybe reducing dependency by one and using the built-in csv reader, but now we're just picking implementations to do the same thing
Can you post the tasks here afterward?
There's no reason to remove pandas as a dependency. People use it as a dependency every day with no issues especially for a task like this. It would be the best tool for the job imo.
Just skimmed through them, and absolutely. It looks like it mostly covers core python - you need to know the syntax, but it barely even touches the standard library. It also starts off fairly gentle. 
A few lessons learned from ACM chapter competitions at my undergrad: * Use a tool like [DOMJudge](https://www.domjudge.org) to grade responses. There are too many ways the contestants can do their solutions and a tool will really help you validate and coordinate test cases. * Have your peers solve each question several ways and provide feedback on the prompts. We had several questions that went unanswered because the prompts were unclear or the problem was too advanced for the demographic * Communicate early and often with the venue to get your internet access needs met. If you need to run a server or set up a network for the competition, test the crap out of it.
Lol what editor do you use atm
Nice try. I will not participate in your survey.
Great, thanks

Nope, it is missing one of the most retarded features: Python-Scopes, or the non existence of them. Any programmer coming from any other language will be surprised by how they "work" in Python ...
I just came from PHP world, having use Laravel for about 4 years, now I learn Python, Masonite introduce many familiar concept, event craft mimicking artisan functionality, too bad most companies in my country don't ever bother with anything else beside Django/Flask
You are now a moderator for /r/Pyongyang
Thanks for those suggestions. Please open a PR so I can credit you.
I think by that point the `python` executable is planned to bed pointing to the latest installed python version.
This is definitely a good candidate for parallelization, but you have some work to do. It sounds like parts of your work (generating the matrix) are embarrassingly parallel, i.e. there is no data dependency among computations. These will definitely be easily dispatched by a GPU, even if you don't have all the knowledge to use them at peak efficiency. For the other jobs where data access overlaps, you need to decide how to divide the work, and assess the overhead associated with sharing the common input data and combining the intermediate results. At the highest level, the flow of assigning a problem to a GPU is as follows: * Write a kernel function to do your work * Allocate space for your inputs and outputs in GPU memory space * Copy input data from CPU to GPU * Configure and launch the kernel * Copy the output data from GPU to CPU The GPU will let you launch a kernel with an arbitrary dimensionality, at minimum 3 dimensions. All data is copied to and from the GPU in a single, linear array, so part of configuration is specifying how to slice that array. Bear in mind that the GPU will group threads into batches of 32 (warps/wavefronts), all of which will run in parallel when it is their turn. This presents a second consideration: if you know that 32 adjacent threads are running at once, does your algorithm access data or memory in a way that is problematic? If you are working on the first element of each row, but your data is stored in row major, then you will load a full row for each thread, which slows down your kernel. In your case, you are using adjacent rows to computer statistics, so you would try to group your threads such that all the threads in the same warp access the same row. This might mean packing your data differently before transferring it to the GPU. CUDA is sufficient for your needs and in my opinion easier to get going with, but OpenCL is more general and better fits the data structures you might be used to (ndrange) For a good general reference, check out "Multicore and GPU Programming: An Integrated Approach" by Gerassimos Barlas. It has many examples of both CUDA and openCL.
Thanks!!! 
Rejoice Dear Leader!
Python is very old. Python is older than Java. Python is older than Windows 3.1. C++ was 6 or so when Python was released. Perl was 4. That's Perl 1, not Perl 5.
I'm currently working with a Raspberry Pi configured to be a clock with live microphone, speaker, and webcam capabilities. Any client can connect to the clock with a wireless connection and access/change its features. I'm trying to build a prototype PA system for a school project. This is definitely my biggest and most complex Python project so far. I've spent more time thinking more methodically than writing actual code. I really want to write clean code for this project, so no weird hacks that 'get the job done'. Currently learning a lot and thinking in new ways. wish me luck
Yeah Django and Flask are some pretty big players in their field but Masonite will get to that level with time.
Yet, every 10 seconds, someone answers a stack overflow question with python 2 code. #TheMoreYouKnow
The only real risk is who has access to the files with the credentials. If it's on a protected internal network, with access only from those who already know those credentials, then it's no mode risky than browsing manually. I'm also assuming the files with credentials aren't stored on the web like in public git repository or something like that.
Thanks. All .py files are stored on the hard drive of the VM and ran locally. 
This is the only good response to that question.

Any and all programming languages can do this. Does a library exist to do it for you in all languages? No clue. But any *programming language* can indeed do this.
Just out of curiosity, what do you consider the one or two most unorthodox aspects of Python's scoping?
That's great to hear. Happy coding :)
That's awesome glad you found something and thanks for updating :)
Ohh iam so sorry iam new to Reddit
Thank you, this is a great response. The issue is my fundamental lack of knowledge when it comes to what goes on under the hood and I think this will be a great problem for me to tackle as I develop my computational skills. After independently testing different parts of the algorithm just now I found that the most intensive part is actually selecting the data that falls within a region. Would a rough example of parallelization be the following: Since I know the shape of the matrix ahead of time I can generate it using ndarray then create a kernel function that takes a set of coordinate intervals, parallelizing the selection and calculation process, ultimately mapping the results onto the matrix. Instead of doing one partition at a time I would do 32 at a time since they are data independent like you said? I understand how my current way of structuring the algorithm is inefficient because I'm practically iterating over an entire data set to find data that I know is local to my region of interest. When you say packing my data differently, would an example of that be restructuring a matrix into an array with the nature of how I'm slicing the rows in mind? That way I can just sequentially iterate without having to do pointless looping? If I'm being honest, since I need to spatially iterate very finely over the data I'm working I'll have to use the same data in some cases hundreds of times for different matrices. When you say "allocate space for your inputs" could this imply i have to reconsider my iterative procedure to minimize re-use of the data? Do you mind if I PM you? I don't want to explicitly talk about the project on here and would love to ask a few more questions. Thanks.
Byte is the smallest unit of data you can read or write.
Looks like it's trying to scrape gpg keys. Like, give out a trace or encryption key to something on your computer. But, it has no methods of sending to another user... so... it might just relay it back to you...
Thank you all for your responses. 
Either this code is invalid or Reddit ate parts of it. Use markdown editor and fenced block to format it correctly. All I can say is this algorithm detects the platform it runs on and sets path to GnuPG executable (or tries to). 
There was some discussion about adding such a feature on mypy's issue tracker: - https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/2499 - https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/5650 In short, there's some interest in making mypy detect such cases/extending mypy's plugin system so people can write plugins to handle this case, but nobody's really worked on anything yet. If you have some spare time, you could perhaps pick up the discussion and try contributing a solution yourself.
When your high a lot of things seem dumb! You seem smart to me. Can you build a darknet market?
You virtual slapped me.
It's somewhat gibberish and wouldn't work as is, but all this snippet appears to be doing is trying to determine if an outdated version of gpg is installed. It's not doing anything with that information, so out of some greater context it's nothing.
I hope so, sadly most of us are bound to programming as a job (to get money) not as passion, so we follow where the money goes LoL. I remembered the days when most job opening are using code igniter in php, quite hard to explain what is laravel.
The only ten year challenge that I care about XD
Just start anywhere and google things you don’t understand. Sure Django is fine now start
tictactoe with adjustable grid size in addition to being able to modify how much consecutive tiles to win. [https://github.com/mrbunton/short-projects/blob/master/modifiable-grid-and-win-condition-tic-tac-toe.py](https://github.com/mrbunton/short-projects/blob/master/modifiable-grid-and-win-condition-tic-tac-toe.py) &amp;#x200B; I also create a AI that searches all possible combinations but in board sizes bigger than 4-4 it starts to take a far longer time. Trying another approach but Im stuck and starting to get bored.
Wanting to contribute to an open source project is a noble idea. However i have the feeling that many who want, want it so they are part of something. Like an achievement. But that's not how it works. Most the time people just have fun to learn. There are many things you can have as a project. My recommendation: Stop trying to do something useful, especially if you are a beginner. Useful things are hard to do, especially when there are so many talented people out there. Pick some own project. You can publish it in GitHub under an open source license. For example you can write an interpreter for your own weird language, or for an existing one. Try brainfuck for starters. Then a compiler then some more advanced language (like some lisp dialect)... Develop your skill set first. Then contribute.
Thanks for the reply. My doubt is mainly that in C or VB you compile and build an application whilst in Python this doesn’t seem to be the norm and I can’t find any indication on how to create such a program. 
Like I mentioned above, my doubt is that I see Python only ever used in scripts and not a compiled program in the traditional sense. So I’m a bit lost as to how to organize the code to be a program running and to create something that keeps running and not run once every time it’s called. This may simply be ignorance on my behalf and all I need is a while loop looking at an event, but can’t find any resources indicating how to achieve this properly. 
So instead of writing bytes as 0s and 1s, i can consider 8 of them at a time and do chr(int(my_bit_str[a:a+8])). Would that work? I basically want the file to store the binary info in the smallest size possible (without compression)
Yeah, I will. Thanks for your message! &amp;#x200B;
&gt; In particular with regard to this notion that one would use context managers to regulate access to the filesystem. I'm not sure I get why you think context manager access is a feature here. What happens on `__enter__` and `__exit__`? Are we actually opening and closing something? What is there to clean up?
Yes, the book is perfect for you. Many absolute beginners find it a bit challenging towards the end. But if you already have basic knowledge, it fits to your current skill level.
You may be too early days for binary data. Usually you'd use the **array** and/or **struct** modules for packing binary data into, and unpacking out of, a file, which will always contain _bytes_. The **array** is for homogenous data (all a single primitive data type), and **struct** is for heterogenous (mixed primitive data types). To work with bits directly you'd use bitwise operations to set the individual bit positions of an **int**, then pack that into a **struct** which you'd write to file. To read it out again you'd unpack the struct to recover your int and then inspect the positive again with bitwise operators. But the actual best path is determined by exactly what you're trying to accomplish.
Nice article, because I'd never heard about PyFilesystem before. I think the `make_editorconfig()` example is (slightly) wrong though. The PyFilesystem code always calls `.touch()` on the file, while the `pathlib` code only calls it if it does not exist.
Storing data in the smallest size possible that involves alteration is compression. I'm not sure what you are trying to do. Assuming you have a sequence of data shorter than 8 bits, the easiest way to store it is to concatenate only significant bits, dividing data blocks. Let's say you have a sequence of 6 bit information chunks A, B and C. If you need to store it and take as less space as possible, you could create a sequence of bytes A{1-6} + B{1-2}, B{3-8} + C{1-2}, C{3-8} + P{1-2} (where P is padding). This way you are storing 6 bit information in 8 bit data containers. The amount of input data must be sufficient enough to justify this compression. As you can see in an example above, three 6-bit elements take the same amount of space in 8-bit storage - the overhead is just a padding. 
Lots of applications that are scripted in Python still only support python2 -- Maya, Nuke, pretty much all the Autodesk products. 
Yes, as long as they are imported correctly it should detect all other .py files. Basically, as long as you can run the script you want to make an exe from using `python scriptname.py`, PyInstaller should work fine. There might be some issues with PyInstaller with some of the more rare packages or configurations. The first to fix any PyInstaller is to try the latest development version pip install https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/archive/develop.tar.gz If that doesn't work I would have a look in the [docs](https://pyinstaller.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), or a quick Google search should probably point you in the right direction.

&gt; And people are still using 2.7. I know people still using 2.6 or even 2.4, and I've heard of (but never met) one chap stuck on Python **1.5** for a single legacy application they can't replace. Don't sneer. If it works, don't break it, and for some people, 10 years just barely counts as "long term support". 
Excel can open CSV files already
It can be done. I would create as many tabs as you need on start up and use a asyncio queue to manage access to tabs which are currently not doing a task. I did something similar for just rendering which you can find here: https://github.com/edmundmartin/sooty Take a look at the rendering code and the example in the readme, they might help
The fact, thar the scope of a variable does not end at the end of the block it is defined in. E.g If cond: Var = .. Will declare a variable that is valid even after the if statement, while in pretty much any other language accessing it would result in an error, while in python it does not (as long as the condition did run). For me, and I guess most other programmers coming from other languages, or rarely using it, this is quite a bit surprising, and in my opinion it should be mentioned in such a short overview.
Can you call it via the -m flag?
Granted, crunching down on massive numpy arrays or pandas dataframes can really slow things down. Programming for GIS applications, in particular those with many features bogs things down pretty good
Umm if it breaks functionality isn't that a major version change e.g. 2.0?
&gt;while in pretty much any other language accessing it would result in an error It's an interesting point. In a dynamic language like Python, introducing a new scope for each block (such as if/while/for/etc.) would literally mean creating a new dictionary for each block, and somehow adding it to the lookup chain. Rather than that overhead, Python allows easy use of explicit namespaces (dicts, object attributes, etc.), or using things like generators and stateful callables to reduce the need for explicitly passing state around, reducing function/method sizes. Granted, I started long enough ago that block scope \*wasn't\* a feature of the commonly used languages; it sort of became fashionable w/ C++, where it's required to work due to RAII. Generally the idea of shadowing variables with scope within a function, or worrying overly about declaring longer lived variables outside a loop, isn't something I miss much. Maybe it's because so often it mainly seems to matter for index variables, for which there are often better alternatives in Python.
We should build a tech company.
Upgrade bug != breaking API changes for the library.
It's interesting how this isn't a problem in Windows where Python apps need to bundle the runtime themselves. 
Is this also an issue if one uses `conda`?
I don't know, is it?
Generate console scripts using [entry\_points](https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setuptools.html#automatic-script-creation) so that you don't have to call `python` every time.
What is the Error you are getting?
Yes, a loop waiting for a system event. How exactly you should do it depends on what kind of app and system you have in mind. Obviously, it was done a hundred times already and ready-to-go solutions are a `pip` away. For example `python-daemon` library for Unix/Python3 or a dozen GUI frameworks. BTW: while proper compiling is possible it is rarely done (only for time critical apps). Even if you distil your app to an exe it is still python bytecode wrapped with some general (system specific) runtime framework. Quite similar to VB or Java to be honest. 
OK the gist of my question is when you "unlock" or "unfreeze" the specific version. Pipenv as I understood from the article allows something like "version 0.12.x" able to update to the latest "x" and also "package_c&gt;=1.0,&lt;=2.0". In any case thanks for the answer and will start the next project with `pipenv`.
Try 'keyring' module to store &amp; retrieve credentials in encryption storage of your choice. It's best practice, even though your source code is compromised, credentials will be safe. 
I think you can mark the string as raw if you prepend r before the string. Example php_code = r'code_data'

So you're saying that freelancers create work for more freelancers? /s Joking aside, you are right that you shouldn't overthink code. The challenge is to find a good middle-ground of keeping it maintainable while not overdesigning. And maybe you're one of the good ones out there who get shit done while keeping it clean. But I've seen some horrible code written by freelancers in my past. In fact, my current job started off as cleaning up the code a freelancer left behind.
I don't disagree with you, but clients gonna want what clients gonna want. They're currently looking very hard at what plan B looks like. I'd also say that "new code should be written compatible with 3" sounds like a solution in theory. We tried it. But when we had a spike when we converted one of the smaller services completely to Python 3, we found that a lot of the "Python 3 compatible" code didn't actually work in Python 3 as its authors intended. If code isn't actually running in Python 3, it's probably not Python 3 compatible.
So, we've scoped it out, and we believe that, in practice, there will be security patches for the foreseeable future - but at a significant cost. Several vendors have committed to supporting Python 2 commmercially after the core dev team EOLs it - most obviously ActiveState, but also OS vendors such as Canonical, as part of their paid-for enterprise offering. 
You aren't getting the error from hitting a product that is out of stock because the item is actually in stock. The code being run is still on the first Url. The problem is that this line of code is coming back empty \- unavailability = page\_soup.findAll("div",{"class": "stock unavailable"}) &amp;#x200B; So when you try to index \[0\] on the next line of code \- status2 = unavailability\[0\] &amp;#x200B; you are getting an index error because the variable status2 is a None type object. 
Sure, but then you're locked into plotly. They do a great Job with that, however I wanted to show some easy alternative to use something different. But agreed if you seek interactive plots go with ploty!

A great point if I ever saw one. Have an upvote.
Binary compatibility on Linux is a complex enough matter that, in most cases, if the OS offers a version of an application or library, you're going to have a better time using that version than bundling your own. Linux distributions typically include more applications in their official repos than most other OSs, for precisely this reason (they typically have a standard supported office suite, for example), and often a goal is to get your application added to the distribution's repos.
Good point. I should probably have used `FS.create` which creates a file if it doesn't exist (but won't touch it otherwise).
I'm not familiar with Plumbum. Looks interesting. Bear in mind PyFilesystem's main selling point is not as a competitor to pathlib (it actually predates pathlib by years). PyFilesystem works with a variety of different data sources, not just the OS filesystem. PyFilesystem's dependancies are quite minimal, all pure python.
You don't ever "unfreeze" a specific version, you always have _some_ sort of a specification, and Pipenv will update to the latest version that fits that specification.
People keep mentioning backwards compatibility, but what exactly does that mean? I've been using Arch for 6 years now and never once ran into problems. If there still happens to be the odd program using python2, install 2 as a dependency and use a shebang. 
With the local drive, `__enter__` and `__exit__` do virtually nothing. But PyFilesystem supports a number of different filesystems. For instance, there as a TempFS, which removes its contents on exit. And ZipFS which compresses the archive on exit. And FTPFS opens a connection to a FTP server on enter, and closes it on exit. So you don't strictly need it for working with your local filesystem, but if you use context manager it will ensure everything works with other data sources...
I definetely needed a while to get comfortable with them, but then I started seeing use-cases everywhere. Caching, timing, debugging, routing, databases, ... Now I rarely write a script or module without a decorator. Someday I'll try decorating my decorators.
Thanks
