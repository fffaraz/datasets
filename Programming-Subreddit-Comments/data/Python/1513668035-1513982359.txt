I always thought men just swiped right on everyone and then filtered through whoever responded that seemed interesting.
If by "seemed interesting" you mean "responded" that's probably true.
Sure, but the algorithm doesn't have a cultural bias, it just shows us what or own cultural bias is. If we're listening.
Yes
The basic tenant of being interesting is don't be nasty or boring. I think that's a fair baseline. 
You can, relatively easy. 
It would keep putting focus on the exact same pixel.
The point isn't about whether you want to match with the right person or not, the point is to flip the game: create a pool from which YOU decide who you want to match. The bigger that pool, the hotter the chicks you can select from. 
I don't know how I haven't run it l into it, considering I've recently done a round of Googling for a python equivalent of java.awt.robot
Not with racism but with another quite similar -ism that could likewise be solved by a different kind of approach other than stigmatizing and generalization. It's about bias. 
Subconsciously? 
This is why our feelings are not a particular good measure of reality. Look, it's simple: no one is trying to stop you (or me) from having the feelings we have about things ... like you I'm more attracted to white women than I am to other skin tones *because* I'm heterosexual and white and have grown up in a predominately heterosexual and white culture and I have an inbuilt biological bias towards sameness and away from strangeness. Like you I also don't want to be lumped in with Nazis. I didn't actively choose any of that, any more than I actively chose to be heterosexual. But the fact that I didn't choose it doesn't mean anything if I don't *also* actively choose to be aware of and resist the more evil impulses that it leads to, and *also* point the finger of shame at anyone who does fall for those more evil impulses. Now, that doesn't mean actively choosing to be attracted to black ladies (with or without big booties), any more than choosing to be aware of your homophobia means going out and bottoming for someone. You don't need to be a Nazi to be racist and sexist, and you don't need to bang or be banged by the rainbow to not be... racism and sexism are natural cognitive bias problems... you become a Nazi (or at least an ass) by acting on that inbuilt racism and sexism, and by not working to filter it out of your decision-making. I dunno why we get so lost on this: I'm colorblind to certain shades of red and green, that's my biology putting an inbuilt bias in my path to good observations ... I must rigorously re-assess what my visual system is telling me in light of that inherent bias, or I will -- rightly -- be called a damned poor painter. Being told you're saying something racist isn't a judgement of you, it's a judgement of what you said ... take that as an opportunity to re-assess.
Also it's not sexist to show someone what you want if they've expressed a desire to know what you want. The important thing to understand is that walking down the street -- or indeed being alive -- while be-boobed **does not** constitute desire to know what you want any more than walking down the the street in a hoodie constitutes a desire to be shot.
There's also a "models" folder. I'm guessing they're comparing the photos to those of pretty models?
I think you may underestimate just how low that baseline can be pushed by biological impulse.

With web you'd probably want to use something that has an idea about the underlying data, such as Selenium. (Assuming this doesn't.)
&gt; Except for the 300 clicks per minute on the exact same pixel. write in a few lines that changes the exact spot by a few turtle degrees to the left, up, right. Am I right?
Nope it's just adb commands, shell basically.
add a section that swipes left every 8, 9 people. 
My thoughts exactly. The ability to watch for elements and react is key.
&gt; Selenium Is it not deprecated? No more firefox plugin to get designers and juniors inhelping to build tests? I must look at this early next year. But my following of hn and /r/ made me believe I might need to use old versions of firefox etc to pull this off?
You'd think that technology would've come so far that emulating mouse input was done 20 years ago, instead of in 2017, as a hack.

```sh echo "does this work?" ``` fsck!
I primarily use python for data analysis. It helps a lot for doing tasks that would otherwise be done in Excel. I started out by automating my monthly reporting projects and that gave me more time to build custom functions. The functions help with data classification, frequency grouping, list condensing, and common graphing tasks.
Chrome driver works very well with Selenium. I’m programming a bot for a browser MMO with it right now
They do kind of different thinks. This still won’t let you inspect the html of webpages to figure out where elements are. You could combine the 2 and make something very powerful though
Or `#!/use/bin/env python` and make damn sure you're resting on both 2 and 3.
 def foo(): while True: yield 1
Don’t forget “hairstylist” and “self-employed”
There's an easy solution, use requests then copy cookies to selenium.
I wouldn't go that far; GitHub also does some very nice enterprise offerings, and is used by a lot of companies. It also has teams, handles private and organizational repos well, and can be hosted or local... it's also historically had better uptime and reliability on its cloud offerings, though Gitlab seems to have closed that gap entirely in the last year or so. I really like Gitlab and they've proven themselves to be somewhat more agile and responsible to especially small to medium enterprise developers, while Github's emphasis seems to be on *big* enterprise, but I'd say it's a step too far to say it's just social networking, as they've got a huge corporate client base.
&gt; A module IS a class. Only insofar as they are objects with attributes. Module objects certainly behave differently from class objects. For example, module objects aren't callable.
Theoretically you could, but you would require quite a large and diverse dataset of labelled images which could make the exercise prohibitive. 
Absolutely. But there's literally no way to definitely know what they want unless they themselves show it unmistakably. And by doing so might already cross the red line of sexual offense. That's the difficulty. How do I show my potential partner that I am interested if I have to wait for them to show me that they are interested as well? How can they on the other hand show me their interest if they have to wait for me to show them mine? How should that work? Someone must take the first step. And if that step already bears the risk of becoming a sex offender, then something is utterly wrong. 
haha your grand I got confused. 
I completely agree with you aside from one little thing: &gt; no one is trying to stop you (or me) from having the feelings we have about things There is a very loud and aggressive part of the women's rights movement that I feel tries to do exactly that. 
what? No that is not what I said at all.
... Not if you must know what version of Python you are running with. Some bugs are version specific, it helps stop confusion and the "but it it works for me" time waster.
Let me put it this way: if your initial approach *might* be across the red line, *you're fundamentally doing it wrong*. The *actual* red line requires physical contact **or** a power differential. Although it might be mightily awkward, there's nothing even potentially criminal about "pardon me, ma'am, but is there any substantial hope that you, in the near future, would like to engage in physical interactions of a libidinal nature?" unless you're that woman's boss / coworker / priest / a random stranger. And let's make one thing absolutely clear: if she isn't currently socializing with you in a non-work associated, non-formal environment, *there is no such hope*. There *might* be hope of getting to that socializing stage first, but -- importantly -- NOT if you're her boss / priest / coworker who could in any way affect their prospects / stranger they haven't been smiling at a lot. This whole line of thinking is what's so funny. Spend some significant time around -- and more importantly listening to -- women, and you'll figure out that they've gotten really quite good at voicing interest and consent. As in when you get up to leave they say something to the tune of "oh, really, you're sure you don't want to stay the night? In my bed?". If they want you they *will* let you know, and in my experience -- save once -- always in a manner that couldn't possibly cross the red line.
in the function "def manualspin():" , times_spun = 0 is set inside the while loop, so it will always be zero. Put it outside the while loop. Also, in the same function , "spin = input()" is inside the while loop again. The used will be printed "Press enter to spin...", but the program will be expecting hit to Enter key after every iteration through while loop. Below changes should work I guess. def manualspin(): print("Press enter to spin...") spin = input() times_spun = 0 while True: times_spun += 1 slot1 = randint(1, 13) slot2 = randint(1, 13) slot3 = randint(1, 13) print(slot1, slot2, slot3, end="\r") if slot1 == slot2 == slot3: print("You win!!!", "Spins until win: %s" % times_spun) if slot1 and slot2 and slot3 == 13: print("Wait! That's all 13's! You lose anyway! :(") elif slot1 and slot2 and slot3 == 7: print("You got the jackpot!!! :D") break
I wouldn't be surprised if they do filter out rapid swiping like this but the algorithm I think you're talking about works a little differently. Tinder monitors you're like to match ratio and filters your matches based on it. If you swipe right on everyone and nobody swipes right on you, you'll be shown (and shown to) less attractive people (people with lower ratios themselves). Until people eventually swipe right on you and your ratio goes up. You also get better matches if you have a higher response rate to your messages and if the person you're messaging uses specific keywords like their phone number. The goal is to show you people of a similar attractiveness. All dating sites do something similar. For best results infrequently swipe (once or twice a week), message everyone who you match with, and always try to get their contact information. But mass right swiping isn't a problem per se if they all match you back.
Yes. You *feel* that. Your feelings are wrong on this matter. That's your bias speaking. They're solely trying to get you to stop expressing those feelings in a manner that threatens or harms them. And, make no mistake, your (by which I mean our, aka male) expressions of sexual feelings **do** threaten them with actual physical harm, in ways you might not be able to grasp without experiencing life from their point of view. Women are trying to establish and defend their right to be free from being sexualized or objectified... that's a right (most) men enjoy from birth and therefore never even have to consider establishing or defending. They're not trying to police your thoughts, they're just trying to get you to police you actions based on those thoughts. And perhaps to consider having other, more producing, thoughts about them.
I just don’t use shebangs...
&gt; this senior dev believes that code should be self-documenting, and references the Agile Manifesto It seems that this senior engineer may be miximg his guidelines: In Python, most strive to be *pythonic*. A *No docstrings* rule would need a lot of justification when writing Python.
One of the biggest obstacles to learning a new programming language, is letting go of aspects of your old one. This is complicated if you are compelled to work with code from others with the same issue.
Geckodriver at the very least works with the latest version of Firefox and the latest update was released on oct 31 so it doesn't look like it's abandoned at all.
Software engineer here, I'm taking a gander at the source code all over a ton of straight polynomial math and analytics endeavoring to identify circles and symmetry under the shoulders, what could this mean?
So the people who wrote your code don't know much about Python. It's not my problem is it? :-)
Just fyi even by default selenium just uses the user-agent that the "host" browser uses. The other points about detecting selenium are obviously still valid.
Maybe OT, but consider [contributing to open source](http://up-for-grabs.net/#/tags/python) as a way to improve your Python. Once you have the language basics, IMHO there's no better way to improve than reading and writing actual code, and solving problems with it.

If he needs the formulas for calculating wind components though, they are: Crosswind: cos(angle difference between runway and wind) * wind velocity in knots. For headwind, swap out cos with sin. He can also reference the Pilots Operating Handbook for the aircraft he is flying. There is a chart there. I hated those bad charts tho, which is why I memorized the formulas (and made the program).

You’re thinking of “selenium ide”. Selenium-webdriver is perfectly compatible with Firefox and Mozilla have their own staff working on the project, too. Lots of companies sell cloud services that do test automation using it in the cloud. Saucelabs is just one.
that's really interesting - you are right, even though that's not true according to the official documentation: https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html &gt;" (Tk itself is not part of Python; it is maintained at ActiveState.)" 
That is great, awesome library tip. But I have to mention that if you google you'll find services that let you mass swipe people on tinder. I've never used them, might be phishing. But I have seen them.
Touch screen is basically mouse emulation. 
There are many programs that emulate the mouse. Going back years I remember using one around 2005 to spam votes in an online poll.

Yup. If you enable this... weird mode in Android's developer options, you can see the shape of your fingerprint, touching the screen. The middle of that shape gets to be your mouse pointer. But it also means the pointer can move around as you're pressing the screen and the shape changes.

XTest extension for Xorg has been around since 1992.
Even more frustrating thing is the take on ugly abstractions also pyramid infrastructure like third party packages seems to be very narrow and often most of them are not maintained and updated. Documentation is another point of frustration because of absence of well defined structure and guidance and often scares newcomers. Look on Python requests documentation for example - it is nice and comprehensive where as Pyramid's documentation seems to stuck mid 2000s. May be it just worth to throw all legacy left from Pylons and move on...

Ah, the old nuclear bomb approach. 
Looks like a nice script, good job! If you want to make it into more of an application you could start introducing classes. For example a `class SlotMachine` would be your main class with some methods that do things you that you repeat right now. For example: def spin(self): self.slots = [randint(1, 13) for i in range(3)] 
Now you look both desperate *and* human.
Seems correct, it uses eigenfaces to get features, and that needs a nicely cropped and centered face.
just have it check where the mouse is every cycle and if it's not within 5px of your desired location, exit.

Perhaps. Machine learning can be a trixy business though. Images taken from a porn site are fundermentally different to tinder pics when it comes to lighting, framing, clothing ect. Training with images from a different domain can be problematic.

Welp, you're using python. Boobs are big circles. Do open cv circle detection. Or hour glass figure. Swipe right whenever there is a hit. Left for three flatties

Python Object Oriented Programming, or in short "POOP(tm)", is a limited subset of multiparadigmatical programming in Python.
Nobody really knows how it works, but likely both factors play in. Mass right swiping will penalize you, and so will being unattractive.

I mean you can literally sublass [ModuleType](https://docs.python.org/3/library/types.html#types.ModuleType) and shove it into the global scope so that it looks like a normal module. It **is** true that the module interface you get by defining something in a new file/module doesn't let you define any magic methods (yet https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0562/), but I feel like that's just because of what python implicitly does when its doing imports
How is wanting to have lighter skin any different than people wanting to have a tan (and thus darker skin) in a western country? How is this different from, say, around Shakespeare's time, when the nobility focused on having the whitest skin possible because the lower class all had to work in the fields and thus ended up with a tan??
"is at its core defined by its power base (and its PoV on beauty) being both male and white" - We had a black president, and we were inches away from a female one. If anyone can get to the most powerful position in the country, I don't think what you said can be true. "If you prefer any particular natural shade of skin color, you're racist" - Have you ever heard of a tan? Or anything that might change skin colors but not race? What about people being attracted to tan-lines themselves? What overly complicated nonsense would you read that into?
Seems that you don't make the difference between asyncio asynchronism and celery asynchronism. Celery asynchronism is in fact dispatching jobs to remote python processes through a message broker, that remote process (worker) runs that in a blocking manner and returns the response to the caller node (if needed). So basically, what it does is running that code synchronously to other process, allowing the main process to do something while it does that. Asyncio asynchronism is achieved by leveraging event loops and coroutines. It's a pretty complex subject, but what happens is that there is an event loop in the python process, that executes the asynchronous function, and when it finishes or becomes inactive due to i/o opperations, the event loop pauses it and executes other stuff until that function can resume it's work. It's more complex that you think it is to integrate asyncio into the django workflow, but if you really want to do that, you need to somehow turn the ``push_to_s3`` function to a coroutine and fire it through an event loop (you can achieve that by reimplementing the boto library functionality to be asyncio friendly too) or replace boto with https://github.com/aio-libs/aiobotocore or similar (haven't worked with this, I don't know if this is what you need, but it's a starting point). Or The simpler way is to execute that same blocking function into a ThreadPoolExecutor (https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html#concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor), but you still have to integrate asyncio into the django workflow, which is not that easy. Or the even simpler way is to execute it in a background task using ``multiprocessing.pool.ThreadPool`` which have the same interface as ``multiprocessing.Pool``, the only difference being that it executes stuff in threads instead of processes (have a look at https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html#multiprocessing.pool.Pool.apply_async . Good luck!

It really depends what you want to do. I wouldn't recommend using sockets directly if you can use something offers a bit of abstraction. ZeroMQ for instance offers quite a few things from simple to super complicated, if you start using your app with it you can scale much easier. There is no downside, it isn't for gaming but is one of the easiest ways to get from point a-b. 
Thank you for the valuable input. however I've edited the question with more details, maybe you want to give some good suggestion.
GUI automation is the least reliable form of automation but it is also the easiest for newcomers to understand and to do. I would encourage people to try GUI automation first but to then move on to using APIs.
Hi! For myself, I work on a non blocant irc bot (will join ##aws-fr when it’s done) that’s parse amazon web services rss newsfeed and send a message on the irc chan when something’s new, with the title and the url of the news ! Cheers ! 
I randomized all the time intervals and the pixel you click on. Rather than finding the coords of one point, find the coords of a box in the "like" button and it will randomly click a point in that box. from pyautogui import position import time from random import randint from random import random upperLeft = list(position()) lowerRight = list(position()) while True: pauseMax = randint(90,110) pauseTime = randint(8,12) for item in range(0,pauseMax): r = random() x = randint(upperLeft[0],lowerRight[0]) y = randint(upperLeft[1],lowerRight[1]) pag.click(x,y) time.sleep(r) time.sleep(pauseTime)
I thought IDLE was built on it, pretty sure it can be done.
the ``boto_3_push`` function is blocking and when you run it, it blocks the event loop. You need to replace it with an asynchronous function (aka coroutine) which releases the event loop when sending and receiving data from the network. I think multiprocessing's ThreadPool is a better choice in this case. Why do you need/want to use asyncio? Is that a requirement?

Yes it does. Firefox ships standard, but chromium ( at least ) can easily be used as simply as just specifying which driver to load.

You can filter tinder manually to only show certain age ranges so you might as well save some time and just set the filter on. Assuming we're going purely off age and not a combination of age and some other factor.

Thanks for the response. I tried that (see commented-out code) but sadly the report still shows nothing.

Tinder already has this. I live in Asia and exclusively date local girls, so it only shows me those girls. Only about 5% of my cards are foreign girls, and they're guaranteed to have already swiped right on me. I've seen other guy's tinder results here and they have a far higher ratio of foreign to local. If tinder is sorting on that kind of basis it's almost certainly doing it for other factors too.

Lol I’m confused why did he pick tinder to demo that? It’s just clicking on the like button right ?

Thank you, I’ll check it out! 
I created this package for personal use, to make it easier to read math and physics results in the Python REPL. I've hosted it on PyPi and Github, since I suspect others will find it useful. I was surprised not to find this functionality in the standard library, nor from a third party.

I'd argue that it's more like a construction worker calling themselves a "carpenter" or even a "finish carpenter". It's a specialization. Someone with decades of experience building hardwood cabinetry would have no trouble framing a house, and would use pine boards like everyone else - but that doesn't make them not a cabinetmaker.
I know it's fake because you got a match.

After I refactored my app to be more modular, I'm fighting with sqlite in memory and unit tests to play along with the new decoupled datasource.
I looked into it and I haven't been able to find an actual legit source that Tinder price discriminates based on how attractive you are. So that's probably not true. What Tinder does do is price discriminate based on age and location. If you're older, you have to pay more. If you live in a country with a higher average income, you have to pay more. Depending on your location and age you pay anywhere between 3 to 30+ dollars for tinder plus, with 10 dollars being the most common price point.
Version? Python 3. Python 2.7 is still extremely relevant, but if you're starting from scratch, there is no point in learning 2.7 when it's about to be end of life. From a beginner's point of view, they are identical enough anyway. Resources? The best online training I've seen are the big paid ones - code school, khan academy come to mind. If you pay either of those sites $20 a month for a few months, and in 2 years time are making junior dev money, the question of "are they worth it?" kind of answers itself. On the other hand, there are thousands of free tutorials out there - check out /r/learnprogramming, or search this subreddit. Make sure it's recent though, any more than a year and you should probably add it to the "maybe" pile. Here's some answers to questions you didn't ask: * The best way to learn programming is in a real class - most cities have learn to code programs, do a search. Hearing other people's questions, and other people's answers to your questions, is invaluable, as are the connections you'll make. I've had multiple job offers thanks to the people I met at hackathons, and their friends and friends of friends. * Linux. I don't have any problems with windows, it's a great OS that does exactly what it's supposed to do (make scary computers accessible to people who don't like scary computers), but if you're going to learn programming, linux, (fiiine, Mac is fine too I guess.). Put it on an old laptop, or if you can't, get a free VM like VirtualBox, create a virtual machine and install linux. Which one? It doesn't matter, but if you have to ask, Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. * Read the python docs. There are several events I can think of where I was consciously aware of my python abilities "leveling up": one was when I first read `functools` documentation, and another when I read (all of!) the `itertools` docs. If you can `map` and `chain` and `yield` as easily as you can `if / else`, then you should be interviewing for the senior dev position, my friend. * github.com. The examples that classes give you are all fine and good, but you'll never truly understand programming until you start to solve real problems. And you'll never understand the reward, the elation, the pride of seeing it work or of coming up with an elegant solution to an ugly problem, unless it's your problem. Either find a personal project (or many), or find something interesting on github, and start contributing. Ideally both. If I'm interviewing you in a few years, and your resume doesn't have your github account (red flag?) I'm going to ask you what your github account is. You don't have one? Please explain. Oh you're on bitbucket hahaha whew. * Your journey, if successful, will be full of late, late nights and frustration like you can't imagine. Stupid computer! Why won't you WORK! This is normal. It means you're doing it right. * Have fun! For it is fun. Writing good code, alone, that no one will ever see, is fun. Getting paid well for a job that doesn't have "working hours" or "dress code" or "a physical office" is fun. Explaining the concept of "unlimited paid time off" to non-programmers is FUN. Please, have fun.
We play Rook (card game) at lunch regularly - so much so that the backs of the cards are worn. In the game there's a 4 card kitty (cards that the highest bidder gets). I'm looking at writing an OpenCV app that can tell which card is which based on the wear pattern on the back. Starting here, haven't done much beyond trying to install Python. Doesn't look like OpenCV runs on android, so I may have to host the main program and just feed it pictures from my phone. Unless there's an easier way to run/install OpenCV and Python as an android app with access to the camera. http://arnab.org/blog/so-i-suck-24-automating-card-games-using-opencv-and-python
Oh man, this brings me back. I actually got started in programming via botting in RuneScape. In the original version of RuneScape I ran across a program called SCAR(Shite Compared to AutoRune) that allowed you to automate KBM input based on the state of the screen. Just like the flash game he automated. Except you wrote this in a variation of Pascal. It was a really cool introduction into programming. Trying to figure out how to detect when my character has fired an arrow by just watching the screen, getting the health of a monster I was attacking and my own health, determining how much food I had left in my inventory to heal with, etc. I distinctly remember realizing that I could apply it to something other than RuneScape. I wrote some scripts to draw spirals and checkerboards in MS Paint. 
Thanks I’ll be trying this soon! I’ve been looking to move away from resourcehogpress aka vulnerabilitypress

"What’s the science term for, uh, t–the titty meat? What’s the actual– …and it’s not the cleavage. I mean, the cleavage is the space in the middle. I’m talking ’bout the meat. The meat, the titty part."
Its a joke ... 
&gt; "Once it's done merging all the files ... it just keeps going." Doing what, exactly? What's the output? The script seems fine (except for the `allFiles` glob which isn't used but it doesn't matter).

Behind in some, ahead in others. I started out programming with c# and visual basic. Being in marketing at the time, I had no illusions about becoming a professional programmer. Just needed answers to some very pressing questions. Excel was my go-to tool for just about everything. Then one day, python was foisted upon me by an over zealous IT guy who didn't want vbasic lurking around. I figured that if I was to learn one more programming language, then python be it. It had these hooks into java and stuff so why not. I had no intention's of becoming a programmer. I just needed a tool. And python suited me just fine. Dynamic vs static (hated the debugging cycle with compiled languages), object oriented meaning that I could pass functions around at will, was able to leap tall buildings within a functional programming mindset when required, and if stuff quacks then abuse it. Because I use python for everything, I've come to discover that it ain't the best fit for everything. Nevertheless, it does everything, and that for me is better than having to learn and master another programming language. Cause programming ain't my day job. So when things like type casting and data classes come along, I'm grateful. The things that it does better than c#, I don't ever want to be pried from my grateful hands.
Tix is becoming such dead weight though. The less I invest in it the better.
I learned to use xdotool for that with bash scripting. Linux things. Needed an autoclicker for idling games.
Thank you for your recommendations. I really appreciate all the detail and added information! I have one more question about Linux. Why is it necessary, and how big of a role does it play on my journey learning python? I’m relatively new to programming, so this is new to me.

Blah. Just use a greasemonkey script. JavaScript will know everything about the page and can simulate UI events.
Selenium is a browser automation tool, not a browser itself. The user-agent is reported the same as when selenium is not in use... Strictly from a web *server* perspective, there is no indication of whether or not the browser is controlled by selenium.
You get it. I get it. I'd bet most people reading it get it. Why beef?
Malnourished, I think.
Just use the decorator tool attrs. Seriously! Your fellow programmers are bound to pick up on it quickly enough. If a marketing guy can 'figure it out' over a lunch time wack-a-mole session using a repl like ptpython and bpython, then these guys who get paid to program, should be able to.

&gt; Is it not deprecated? As others have already commented, you are talking about Selenium IDE. But also, Selenium isn't what you may remember it to be at all in recent years. These days every browser designer is building their own driver that implements the web-driver protocols. Geckodriver, Chromedriver, etc. Right now web-driver is actually in draft for w3c consideration. [Reference](https://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver/) That means, potentially, in the future, to build a standards supporting browser, you'll have to include webdriver support. So, Selenium which kinda was a defacto standard in browser automation, is about to become literally the standard.
why those terms?
I'm sure they brought that into the factoring, considering it's a dating app

Problem statement : There are a bunch of stock market funds (called mutual funds in my region) suggested in best sites every week. As weeks pass by, it is difficult to keep a track of who suggested what. Solution : Creating a project that will save all the funds suggested, and will aggregate them and tell the most suggested fund. Very small and silly, but helps!

And the other guy who figured this out, he started Terraform... 
Some people also got grandfathered in at lower prices. I used to pay $2 per month, but forgot to change my CC info after there was (unrelated) fraud on my card. So, my account got terminated and my new price was $8 per month (even after explaining to customer support).
I would go to the devs of IOTA and see if they can help.
You had me at Selenium. &lt;3
Thanks!

Apparently. The app itself is free but like with almost all free apps there are "perks" you can pay for.
&gt; The web server could trivially detect selenium Simply untrue. It is certainly possible, but far from trivial and you would need some form of client-side code to do this. The web server otherwise has no way of knowing whether or not a browser is controlled by selenium, or even if requests were sent to the server by a browser at all... The client is in *complete* control of what is sent to the server. Further, because client-side code is able to be examined, controlled, and altered by the client, server-side methods are almost exclusively used. Actual client-side active deterrents beyond, say, Google ReCaptcha are rarely, if ever, implemented on the client-side. Instead, the most effective and commonly deployed detection methods (including methods used by ReCaptcha) are often heuristic in nature and look for bot-like behavior and activity from a server-side perspective, agnostic of what is actually controlling the behavior... And most sites don't even actively deter this. Automation experts merely need to make sure that communication with the server is indistinguishable from that of an ordinary client... which often doesn't even need a browser to begin with because the server doesn't care or know how it receives requests, only that they are well-formed and include the information expected. Having done many projects in web automation, I can personally attest that there are very very very few cases where a tool like PyAutoGUI is the best choice for automating actions that take place in a browser. For whatever that is worth.
Did you get fuk?
the quick answers is that there is no easy way to do it with asyncio. Any function that calls async function have to be async by itself. As @i_like_trains_a_lot1 mentioned, what is the reason that you need to make this change? Are you really sure you want to remove celery?

The point is you can't - not automatically - as I say - of the 74 potential words in the document only 16 are unambigious - that leaves you a lot of manual work to make sense of the mess - The code I used is : https://pastebin.com/FANpPCdM To make the mess clear the code puts '!!' each side of any word where there is no match (likely proper-nouns), and where a word has multiple options the code outputs each candidate word separated by '|'. The code sends everything to output.txt. The code doesn't preserve punctuation in the output. The code print two numbers t the screen when it finishes - the first is the number of completely unambiguously words that are found, and the 2nd is the total number of words that the code has attempted to match (including numbers). Let me know if you have any questions about my code; apologies for the lack of comments - I just hacked it together.
if you want all the fancy stuff like fork, auth against your ad/ldap etc. i would recommend gitlab. if you just want git repos with access over ssh + access control: try gitolite. Maybe in combination with gitweb.
It creates another CSV file, where I can watch the size grow as it adds each CSV to it. Once it completes each CSV, it prints saying which CSV file has been imported. After it goes through all the files in the folder, the combined file size will keep growing until I stop it, but it doesn't print anything.
Okay. That may be just damn cool. I replaced the /src/byrthon.x script lines with: &lt;script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/brython-dev/brython/3.3.5/www/src/brython.js"&gt; &lt;/script&gt; &lt;script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/brython-dev/brython/3.3.5/www/src/brython_stdlib.js"&gt; &lt;/script&gt; and that works like a champ. Don't have to bug my IT guy for installation and can use it on my mac...even inside of coda. thanks!
&gt; "is at its core defined by its power base (and its PoV on beauty) being both male and white" - We had a black president, and we were inches away from a female one. If anyone can get to the most powerful position in the country, I don't think what you said can be true. One Black President out of 45, and no female ones, does not constitute an equal society. Especially when the female one was defeated by the most unqualified and unworthy white male in the nation's history. Come back to me when the halls of Congress, the Supreme Court, and the White House look exactly like the demographics of your local Walmart, nevermind the people who fund all the movies and advertising. &gt; "If you prefer any particular natural shade of skin color, you're racist" - Have you ever heard of a tan? Or anything that might change skin colors but not race? What about people being attracted to tan-lines themselves? What overly complicated nonsense would you read that into? See also the definition of "natural". Some people find the Donald's shade of orange attractive -- mainly Eastern European immigrants, for some reason -- but this is not a naturally-derived shade of human flesh. But again your seeing your inherent racism as a judgement of your moral worth ... the judgement happens if you act on that racism, or promote it as a virtue.
actually, at the risk of being a nag...one good thing about the javascript use is that it goes "backwards" as well as "forwards"... that is, in the example you provided, not only could one enter the fraction of c and get beta and gamma, but one could enter a value for beta and gamma and the fraction of c would appear (forgetting for the moment that beta and the fraction of c are the same thing). Can you think of a slick way to do that in this example? 
Well, yes, of course, that's what I said basically. But there would be slight issue with running javascript in opened webpage from python script, which these test frameworks solve.
Thanks for the comment, you're 100% right and didn't obsess about that "300 clicks per minute" jab I tacked on at the end like most replies did. Selenium is a valid approach that I was probably too quick to dismiss. My original comment was that for this specific case (making us all laugh), the code OP provided met all the requirements at minimal cost. The problem with selenium is that when you're in a situation that requires that level of camouflage, the server will likely utilize another method to counter it. Selenium is a partial solution in an arms race. I have a project that uses selenium against a public data source (government data) but they're using tech from companies who advertise they can stop selenium scrapers. We do get around it, but we all know that it will continue to cost time and money to work around but ultimately this will be solved through out-of-channel solutions (lawyer letters, friendly emails to build rapport, etc). Given the arm's-race nature and the increased infrastructure costs selenium expects (system requirements are more than "click here") that's why I spoke against it. 
No more firefox plugin to get features, and so will being unattractive.
Ahhh, makes more sense, haha.
Well if your goal is to learn python, then python is python no matter what your OS is. But you'll find that anything development related is simply easier on linux / mac than it is on windows. Here's the command to install python3 on ubuntu: `sudo apt install python3`. How do you install python on windows? Download an installer, click next next next, adjust your path, oops we didn't run it with admin privileges, etc. Repeat for database backends, development tools (git on windows, anyone?) and god forbid if you have to compile something (and you will). The learning curve to learn enough linux to get you started with more than pay for itself over time. 
meh
&gt; Python meets all those... Not at all. Try reading the article that I linked to because it pretty much proves you wrong. &gt; What's your beef with meaningful indentation? It needlessly complicates every situation where the code must be worked with. For example, let's visit some other language sub-reddits: r/javascript, r/csharp, r/ruby Did you see any prominently placed notes about how to post code in those? Nope? What we see when we visit r/Python: **Posting code to this subreddit:** *Add 4 extra spaces before each line of code* def fibonacci(): a, b = 0, 1 while True: yield a a, b = b, a + b And why is that? Because Python is a stupid language created by a mentally unbalanced person.

My roommate is currently programming runsecape bots with Scala. I'm gonna send him those post. Sounds awesome.
If your on Linux or Mac you can do this on the cli with cat. Some thing like 'cat ./*csv &gt; newfile.csv'
I've been authoring a tool for my QA/dev group that will probably end up being replaced by a chatbot, but I don't mind. I'm pretty pumped on this. It's the first bit I've done "real" programming for a job. It's a tool that refreshes QA environments and reinstalls our software by using the Saltstack API. Right now it just reverts snapshots back on a couple servers we have free reign over (using a custom runner I also wrote that uses pyvmomi for vSphere), and then hits the API again to state.apply the server. Next steps are logging and then replacing the Snapshot nonsense with spinning up new machines with salt-cloud.
Only if you choose to leave a useless comment on my reddit post :-)

He's been flying for a few years but I figured making a little app for it would tickle him haha, I'll see what I can do :P
Bad bot
Your mother was quite thankful. 
Modern RS bots are leagues different. Back then we were only just starting to fiddle with modified clients and other methods. If he's ever interested in looking up old RS bots tell him to google "The little black book of RuneScape cheating". It was written by the standard teen of the time but it's got a lot of the botting history in it. I'm feeling the urge to go on a nostalgic ramble about it all so I'll stop myself here.
Well many networks only train in supervised sessions, and this is especially true of a network such as this one that runs on tons of frames of video. In other words, whether or not you could train the network to avoid these perturbations, it wouldn't happen automatically.

so i make tup1= first names and tup2 = last names then when i sort will they names stay with each other sorry I'm pretty new to this 
As someone who is only a bit past that, keep it up!
I've seen the same anti-pattern used in a C# project before. Bad coders will make bad code. I think the worst part of the culture around Python is a side-effect of it having so few concrete rules that people want to reach out and grab any rule they can, so they pep-8 the shit out of your stuff while leaving the functional review aside. Kind of a meta side-note, it's annoying how easy it is to get downvoted when having a Python discussion on r/python
No, you need to make a list of tuples [(first, last), (,), ...] Or use ‘zip’ function: zip((first, ...), (last, ...))
yes, I want to remove celery, because this is the only task i'm running in my project and thinking of doing using python core libraries.
Awesome article, really enjoyed it
yes, I want to remove celery, because this is the only task i'm running in my project. I'm not bound to use asyncio, I just want to get rid of celery and thinking of doing using python core libraries as you suggested using multiprocessing's ThreadPool. but I don't have any idea of that, would be great if you can give some hint. 
It's great, I've had to use it for some "hacky" work arounds for projects before and it's actually pretty powerful
&gt; Most of the companies in fields like gaming, networking, graphic design applications, etc use this language as it has the most dynamically challenging module. What does this even mean?

It means, math is beautiful.
This seems like it would be an interesting project for tensorflow.. You'd have to collect a lot of pictures of various women to build a good data set... You'd literally spend days and days just looking at women. I have a lot on my plate right now but I think I could find time to assist with this data gathering part. 
Not really. If you vet the uglies first this will reduce the number of wasted right swipes. The pool overall might end up being larger and better. 
You can, if you find it readable replace : done = False while not done: for event in pygame.event.get(): if event.type == pygame.QUIT: done = True By : while all(event.type != pygame.QUIT for event in pygame.event.get()):
I was thinking of something like this # in the global scope to reuse it between requests pool = multiprocessing.pool.ThreadPool() # in view async_res = pool.apply_async(boto_s3_push, data) # do other stuff meanwhile result = async_res.get() # finish the request return HttpRequest(...)
Selenium is better for web stuff, pyautogui can automate non web stuff like desktop apps
I think these days Firefox or chrome supports headless mode, which would probably be even better
Python lacks any kind of type-safety. I'm not going to find a citation for that - it's simply not a feature in the language. Duck-Typing seems neat for smallish projects, especially ones where the code base is small enough to fit into each team member's minds. The problem that OP describes is a real one. It can be quite hard to reason about what went wrong in a Python program. We've all seen an AttributeError because NoneType doesn't have a getFoo() method. Typically that means somewhere else in the program, a name that should contain a value contains a None. In a non-typesafe language that sort of bug can be a pain to resolve because as OP says, you literally have to run it and then set break-points and trace the unexpected value back to its source. This is not too different from Java's equally painful null-pointer-exception. My original point was that many modern languages have introduced features that help deal with the problems of optional data, and knowing for sure what kinds of type will be passed into a function. This makes it significantly easier to reason about what went wrong when something eventually does go wrong. I think one of the bigger problems with the Python community is that many devs have never experienced what other languages can offer. Java and C# are often looked down upon by Python developers. Python developers often receive a nasty shock when the language features which made the language very suitable for small projects really painful for big projects.
It's a joke. It's not a very original joke -- did the same thing like a decade ago with HotOrNot -- but it's a joke.
Selenium useragent would just be the useragent of the browser unless you're using phantomjs and since chrome and Firefox have headless mode now why would you As for rate of clicks you can sleep just like with pyautogui
I got offered a 75% off deal once, took it. Pay like $30/yr for tinder plus 
It means they used the hard way instead of the easy way. 
As fellow redditor noticed, zip will be handy here if you already have two list: first = ['John', 'Guido', 'Jane'] last = ['Doe', 'van Rossum', 'Doe'] combined = zip(x, y) Now you have your connected names and if you sort it you get: people = sorted(combined) print(people) [('Guido', 'van Rossum'), ('Jane', 'Doe'), ('John', 'Doe')] If you want them sorted on last name and then on first name use the *key* argument to sort on second element of tuple: from operator import itemgetter people = sorted(combined, key=itemgetter(1, 0)) print(people) [('Jane', 'Doe'), ('John', 'Doe'), ('Guido', 'van Rossum')] sorted(student_tuples, key=lambda student: student[2]) 
Might want to put NSFW on this...
You fuck get tinder from?
Just FYI, both Chrome and Firefox finally have real headless modes (does not require virtual framebuffer). Also it uses a new protocol called Marionette, very much WebDriver plus some extra. See "[GeckoDriver.prototype.commands](https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/testing/marionette/driver.js?from=testing%2Fmarionette%2Fdriver.js#3488)" for the commands.

You're an ironman you shouldn't be using an autoclicker Also, this is way cooler than garyshood autoclicker Also, that autoclicker is totally outclassed by AHK
This may or may not be cool to you but I've been working on my own framework for the past few weeks. its at https://github.com/josephmancuso/python-framework if you want to take a look. although it does not come with the authentication system, all you have to do is run `python craft auth` in the terminal and it will scaffold the authentication system for you to include a registration, login and simple dashboard, add the controllers, views and templates all for you. If you would like to test it out and contribute it then Pull Requests are welcome :)
haven't tested it, but it looks like your trading_bot.py might have some api keys still hard coded in there.
AlrIght, thank you for the tips, I'll try those. 
That's a pretty good idea! I'll try using classes. 
This is cool but I think goes against: &gt; Explicit is better than implicit. If you want scientific notation, why not do: print('{:0.4e}'.format(my_number)) (for example). And/or a better way may be to make a `sciprint` function. Then the user can say: from __future__ import print_function # if on python 2 print = sciprint
So it sounds like Selenium is a better choice, at least for web apps. It can ever run headless. My question is can Pyautogui read graphical text? A lot of web apps display images of text rather than text.
After reading your answer...I installed Ubuntu. (It is a learning curve.) Thank you for all your input I really appreciate it! Now to begin my journey learning python. 
Selenium lets you do it through Chrome and old Firefox.
&gt; and make damn sure you're resting testing? Anyway, this is what I do. Even if I am the *only* user of my codes, I never assume I will 100% be on one or the other since I move around a lot (unfortunately...).
Selenium is in some ideological battle with Firefox over signing their plugins so it only works in older versions. I'm using Selenium with chromedriver now.
Did you make everyone hot there? 
why? They are pretty useful for two things. The first is to be able to do (if executable permissions set): `./my_code.py` (this is a minor one). The bigger use is if, say, I want it to be a CLI utility. I can then add it to my path (and remove the `.py`). They certainly do not do any harm. Regardless of what is in the shebang, if there is one, when you do python my_code.py it will always run with the version of python you specify. It also does have the nice advantage that if I *explicitly* see `python3` or `python2` in the shebang, I know it is only made to run the one (I do not assume it is cross-compatible if there is just `python`)
Is that similar to a functional programing approach?

It is running main (you can verify this with a debugging print statement as the first statement in the function) but main isn't blocking and you won't see a window until you call the event loop. Read the docs for tkinter.
Selenium is awesome, particularly when used alongside other tools. At work we have combined it with open CV to image match on canvas elements where selenium is no good. We then use the image match coordinates to click with selenium.

I feel like I think 4.10×10⁻⁶ looks more idiomatic than 4.10e-06; e notation as a display appears to be a holdback from a pre-unicode era, except when indicating low-level float precision. The included disp function does what your second point describes.

Thanks for the catch, edited. Yeah that's what I've been doing too... I work in VFX, and we're only coming around to the idea, right now, that Python3 is actually going to happen. Should have been planning on it and moving to it for at least five years, now we've got millions of LOC across the industry that will need to slam over in about a year. Fun.
We have [a pretty long list of learning resources in the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/index#wiki_new_to_programming.3F). Try a few and see what resonates. For a brand new programmer I'd recommend codecademy. Also, if you don't have one already make sure you look for a project that interests you and start on it as soon as you can. Programming is a lot more fun if you have a goal. If you have questions or get stuck come visit us in /r/learnpython. 
Ok, thank you. I will try codeacademy

Would love to know your thoughts if you think there are missing libraries!
Just never personally come across a use for it. In dev your venv defines the interpreter, in prod it’s explicit, for a utility I’ll use setuptools/distutils.
PhantomJS integrates well also, though I've seen other guy's kindling results here.
&gt; please help What do you need help with? 
Would you give a use case? I am trying to figure out why you would need this....
You say that but it's not PEP8 compliant.

haha, I'm studying a Udacity web dev nano degree and I came across python first, I have no IT background bar working in digital marketing. I really enjoy learning to code but not to sure how to move forward with it. 
I'm not to sure, I guess context, I'm at a very early entery level stage with HTML, basic CSS and very very basic python, guess I need a project to focus on that requires all three languages. how do I apply it to web dev? Thanks for replying.
ooo interesting!
This guy Tinders.
Look into learning a python web framework. There's an [enormous amount of them](https://wiki.python.org/moin/WebFrameworks) but Flask or Django are probably the most popular. Most websites also use databases and javascript a lot, so maybe look into learning those too. 
Thank you, this helps alot.
I liked this guy's channel on Python tutorials. https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCezIgC97PvUuR4_gbFUs5g
I subscribed. I'm looking to dev a personal blog/CV type website and the goal is to complete the basic skeleton by the end the jan. This is a basic wordpress blog I have tested but I don't like wordpress and i hate wix.com https://musingsofanamatureadult.wordpress.com/
That works too, but when making it more interactive by adding more events it is easier to add to how I have it now.
Well I wouldn't consider it as a problem, but I don't really know what you project is, so you know it better. Anyways just use threading then. 
With Windows apps, you can only open and close those right? (and get the output if it outputs to the terminal) You can't manipulate those apps right? 
Thanks. I'm not too familiar with these applications (except ffmpeg), but I will take a look and see if it furthers my understanding of subprocess. 
The `pyautogui` module bundles many of the things needed for that kind of work, like searching for an image on the screen or automating keystrokes or mouse movements. 
Put another print in the beginning of the loop to check what it's doing. print(f"Importing {fname}...") 
Yes, why not? You can definitely do it. You can create a startup, raise a money and become a fame and can have women as many as you want. Your startup will save a world and etc. Python is just a tool, you can use to do a lot of the things on a computer.
IMO hackerranks and other same resources is best place to find an idea
Depends on the app. You can always use one of the GUI manipulation tools.
Why not use sockets directly? Learning and curious
I have read some crap during my career but nothing like this. Python is strongly but dynamically typed, end of story. Poncing about with the likes of Java just burns the most important thing that's available to everybody, time.
It says its importing the output file. I have the output located in a different folder so I do not know why its including it.
There is a good competition going for neo Blockchain. Based on smart contracts. There is lot of money involved. If you are competent you can sign up and create your own application. No cheating here becoz Microsoft china is committed hosting. https://neo.org/competition.html
Sure. The line @document["v"].bind("change") means : when the event "change" happens on the element with the id "v", execute the function below. If you want to handle the event "change" on beta and gamma, give the matching INPUTs an id (eg "beta" and "gamma") and use the same syntax, with another function.
It's hard to say without checking your full environment. A quick fix is to output to .txt and then rename it to .csv after the loop.

To be honest, I think I was being sarcastic when I posted that. 
Well why learn the lower level version when you can use the abstraction and save on time and have more features. Also ZeroMQ has the added benefit of being (mostly) inter-operable with different languages and the code on each language would look fairly similar since the bindings follow a very similar style. It just makes it all much cleaner. Mostly the way I would argue this is Sockets teach you there is a hole in the wall you can pass things through, ZeroMQ adds logic on top of that and good patterns for free. 
Are there any new features in this update?
Not quite. Assume A1 =B1+1 and B1 =C1+1, C1=1 and we want to calculate A1. OP's method calculates A1, which then calculates+propagates B1, which then calculates+propagates C1. The alternative is to collect all the dependencies of A1 (in this case B1 and C1) and then evaluate any cells that have all of their variables solved (so C1 gets set), repeating until we either hit a circular dependency or A1 can be evaluated (in this case, we set B1 and all is well, but if B1=C1+1 and C1 =B1+1, it would immediately fail).

I work as a test consultant and I use a python almost every day. I'm still a newbie and learning but have a few scripts that I have developed so far. 1) We have an APM tool in place and I've written a script to request certain from the tools's API. Had to do this programmatically as the tool didnt have the feature out of the box. Basically, running the script every Monday morning requesting data for the last one week (Monday to Sunday) and also for the previous 4 weeks. After pulling the data, the scripts saves everything in a CSV which I then use to create an excel graph. Modules used - Requests, csv, BeautifulSoup 2) Again with the APM tool, have a script to calculate the business transactions for every node instrumented. Helps us keep track of it. Using the same API and modules as above. 3) I develop mock services as part of my daily job and have developed over 100 now. Developing a dashboard where people can view which services are available, which ones are being consumed by which projects, various statistics about services, searching for services. This is still in progress. Modules used - flask, flask-migrate, sqlalchemy, etc. 4) Developed a script to fetch exchange rates from various website. Exposed this as website now (Flask). 
That's vim.
Lots of fixes and improvements, no new features.
CM you son of a bitch! :P
Well, while I am always open to new ideas and a new language sounds great, the problem is that there is already Powershell, C# and F# for the MS developer. If MS is to develop a new programming language that mimics Python to attract Python developers as they did with J# to attract Java developers, while I would personally use it, I doubt it would have a lot of traction. **The question is who will use it?**
Vim in a terminal, not an IDE as such. Just a good editor.
Whoops didn't realize what sub I was in, I am surprised I got so many upvotes from behind enemy lines
Its me wanting the same answer :)
I am building a [Linux app](https://github.com/0dysseas/news-indicator) indicator that retrieves and displays instantly a variety of news stories(e.g. tech, political, sports etc) from top media outlets. User is notified via notification messages every time the news have been retrieved and also has the ability to change the news retrieval interval as well as the news sources. A very useful for all of us news-junkies out there. 
its not maintained well / frequently. It doesn't integrate well sometimes when you have situations where you have compile something for example. I sometimes find on windows, with a precompiled binary it works fine, but on linjux where no precomppiled binary is around, it becomes an albotross to configure. 
Pyautogui's failsafe terminates it if you slam the mouse to the top left of the screen.
Brilliant. Could be the hook that gets more millennials into code. 
Look like a combination of [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki) and vim most probably using some [vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim#quick-start)s to give it IDE superpowers.
Hey thanks man!! That's fixed. Besides that API has been deleted anyway but thanks for the heads up. Kudos. 
How are you going about it? A course? YouTube videos? Reading the docs?
Very cool. Check out wxPython while you're at it. It's Python bindings for the wxWidgets C++ library. Essentially, wx uses the GUI framework that is most native to your OS. So, on Linux it would use GTK, Windows it would use win32, Mac (I believe) it uses Cocoa. It has a built-in module for creating spreadsheet applications [like this](http://zetcode.com/img/gui/wxpython/spreadsheet.png). Also, wxPython is HiDPI aware. Not sure if Tkinter is.

Can anyone tell me what this is accomplishing (in the gif)? Just clicking through pictures? Also, "till a baby" is a terrible username for a dating site IMO.
Isn’t this the same as selenium? 
I know that now, thanks. After I installed and immediately ran the program, I didn't have a chance to look at documentation. 
Too many machine learning libraries. I know they're the new shiny, but they're not used by the majority of Python developers.
There are never new features in a bug fix release like this. Keep your eyes on [What’s New In Python 3.7](https://docs.python.org/3.7/whatsnew/3.7.html) for new features and other changes.

Hi, I'm the guy who made PyAutoGUI. Though I wouldn't say I maintain it since it has... 19 pull requests and 90 open issues?! I should get off Reddit.
Yes! And english aswell!
It doesn't. I highly recommend you use something like Selenium if you need to work with the browser. PyAutoGUI is great, but it's also incredibly brittle: it can be hard to detect when your gui automation script has gone off the rails and is just blindly clicking on things. But for desktop apps or HTML5 canvases, PyAutoGUI is pretty good.
Hey man, I really like your work. I wouldn't sweat it, procrastination / priorities are complicated =p happens to the best of us m8. 
Hi, I'm the maker of PyAutoGUI and the author of [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/). I'm always shocked how popular PyAutoGUI became; it and the web scraping chapter are the most popular pages for the online book. But also I want to say that it wasn't leet hacker coding skillz that let me produce it. A lot of the functionality is from copy/pasting Stack Overflow posts or pulled from other gui automation tools. My main contribution was making PyAutoGUI: * run on Python 2 and 3 * run on Windows, Mac, and Linux * have a dead simple API I really encourage other people to take this approach if they want to create their own modules: find some great tool and help make it more widely accessible. I really love AutoHotkey for Windows. I just wish it ran on other OSes and also, you know, they didn't invent a whole new scripting language to use it. A lot of its features are things I want to see in the future PyAutoGUI versions. If you'd like to contribute, you can check out the project on GitHub: https://github.com/asweigart/pyautogui The main work I'd like to see is: * foreign keyboard key support * global hotkey registration * obtaining window information (I'm working on this separately in PyGetWindow: https://github.com/asweigart/pygetwindow ) I'm also thinking about adding features to fool bot-detection (adding random variations to the timings and movements to appear more human-like) but I want to think through the ethical implications of that first.
http://pyvideo.org/ 
from 2012...wow I'm old. Stop writing classes. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9pEzgHorH0
Global hotkey registration would be amazing. Honestly, anyone that wants to create these bot detection avoidance functions could do it in a few minutes. You don't need to be an accessory to that stuff.
Interesting. I wonder if that data can be correlated with different fingers, each finger swiping would possibly give a different pattern. You could then use that and the accelerometer data to determine which hand the phone is in. I don't know what you could use that info for but it would be a fun excitement to see if it's possible.
TTY*
I'm not sure there is a right way. In fact, I'm almost sure there isn't. I also think everyone thinks learn they learn too slow. I bet you know more than you think you do. Hang in there!
To a certain degree this is the case, but KNN on just the pixels is probably a poor approximate for “type” as much as “general colors that are used in the photo.” There are localization algorithms that can detect the face, then CNNs pretrained for facial recognition that can describe the face in an abstract/compact/much more useful representation for clustering by freezing an intermediate layer...this would be a cool side project. 
Anything from pydata
Less than a year old... launched in March.
Python for me is the language of choice for quick and dirty solutions: projects that I don't expect will be too big (1000 lines, tops), and/or no more than two developers working on it. Bigger than that and I go for a statically typed language to avoid the issues you mentioned.
I didn’t have a smartphone in 2013, and had to use the website. It existed, just maybe not in its current form absolutely.

Don't ask people on /r/Python to do your homework for you. Do the honorable thing and pay someone to do it for you.
PyAutoGUI has a "failsafe" feature where if the mouse is located at 0, 0 at the end of a pyautogui function call, it will raise an exception and stop your program. (Functions in pyautogui also have a tenth-second pause by default, giving you time to move the mouse here.) So all you have to do to stop it is slam the mouse to the top-right corner. However, this doesn't work if you have multiple monitors and can't just slam the mouse into that corner.
I do wish IE had got on that bandwagon. It is extrememly frustrating validating everything works then finding out they "support" *another* standard feature in a bizarre way only after it goes through automated testing.
If i need help and someone wants to help me thats none of your business. Happy holidays 
I wrote a 2015 blog post on the 3 best Python books for you and your team (for diving deep into Python). It still holds up, I think. http://www.pixelmonkey.org/2015/06/06/pybooks The three recommendations in there are the first half of Python Essential Reference, the whole of Fluent Python, and using Python Cookbook as a skim/exercise auxiliary material.
thx, i will
I really love how elixir cli tools work, and built several projects. But haven't tried out python on project. Well I googled out this project, but not sure how workflow of python project is. Is there any suggestions guys(Or any article I can check) :) ?
Sadly, this can't really be done without fingerprints, because, while the size of each finger does matter, so does the angle and the pressure, so you can guess a bunch of different possible angle-pressure-finger combos, but not precisely know. What can be used, which I have never seen done, is the rotational angle of the finger on the phone.
It skip ugly girls? 
Al Sweigart actually wrote the PyAutoGUI module
Heck no lol, hes/shes my kind of person
I can't believe I've never encountered PyFlux before, I've been looking for something similar before. I do agree with the other person saying your list is a bit machine-learning heavy for a top python library summary, but it's not useless for sure.
Is this help being offered for free?
There isn't _anything_ to understand about `subprocess` or subprocesses in general, other than how an operating system makes new processes (spawns new programs, starts new programs, fork, exec, whatever you want to call it). Understand how an operating system makes them. Understand how it can connect them. Everything else is case-by-case. You'll know when you need to call another program or process. I take it you're a Windows user? Doesn't sound like you use shell much.
Ie does support selenium though not headless mode
Feminist? Really? And you guys wonder why you can't get women lol
That doesn't work if none of them match you back
The trouble is that if you're running *a lot* of tests, esp real time (while developing), not using headless is rough. 
Great! Thanks. just one more doubt. let say I have 10000 requests per second and each request will be calling this view which is calling boto_s3_push function. now after using multiprocessing.pool, would that affect the overall speed/performance ?
Static typing would be cool, but the rest is extremely nitpicky. Python has closures and immutable structures. The bit about "what if I over ride a class an overwrite a method" is dumb because the double underscore explicitly protects against that. That's exactly what it is for!
I hate articles written like these. 1. If you remove the first paragraph in each listing, it suddenly makes more sense. 2. List the fucking libraries in the post instead of linking to some faggot blog.
Probably better to learn with lower level than move up.

Headless mode really helps When I was developing selenium tests not long ago headless mode wasn't ready in Firefox or chrome and you had to use phantomjs

I'm trying to simplify virtual environment activation. I [did](https://github.com/jalanb/jab/commit/3d6e66e4a81bb3da94f619e72612cf37f5233bf9) try [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#readme), with [pyenv-virtualenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-virtualenv/blob/master/README.md), but it could not cover all my use cases, in particular where the primary project was still in Python2, but the DevOps scripts are in Python3. Pain point. Most of my Python projects have a `bin` directory so I create a link in there to `/.virtualenvs/blah/blah/bin/activate`. I change my prompt and my `py` command to [always source any local `activate`](https://github.com/jalanb/jab/commit/599a86227b561fd6277bf932c3a6b598ed377218)s. The `py` command should run in a subshell and then call `deactivate`, but so far the `post cd hook` approach works, and I don't need a new `py` command.

Not really, the patterns match even in ZMQ, the issue is mostly do you want to play around with sending things in a more rigid pattern or one with a bit of behaviour. I'd highly suggest the latter because it shows you the idea of smarter networking

Yeah it's all community-driven. We're creating a business around it, but believe that these answers (and the exchange of questions/answers) need to be completely free and open for it to work.

What scenarios do you need IOC in Python?
[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) will probably meet your needs. It's a distribution of Python and a bunch of libraries intended for data science. Comes with a package manager, and has Enterprise solutions if that's where you're headed. And it's only one installer.
If you plan to use Python for Data Analysis, I would suggest to install Anaconda https://www.anaconda.com/download/. That's probably the easiest solution for you and IT. 
In this case, you could probably guess based on their username alone though.
Yes.
Hi, I’m the author of this blog post. If anyone has any questions I’ll be happy to answer.
I think that Microsoft focused on Python and only because of its popular, I don't look for more python codes of Microsoft from its GitHub. And maybe Microsoft only follow the fashion. If another language became popular, Microsoft will still give a support. :-p
I still can't understand what is the point of it? The first example shows perfectly to me why I don't want to use Picobox
 from itertools import chain max(len(word) for chain.from_iterable(tableData)) 
There have been unofficial desktop apps and web interfaces for a while. The new web interface is the only thing Tinder themselves have put out other than the native apps.
Certstream feed into elastic.
I could mention that Python doesn't have variables, it has names, but I won't. D'oh :-)
https://gist.github.com/troeri/d2cc30a65c81aa6c9defd11a6710c00a here's the code if it helps you :)
The example glaringly shows the author not really grasping the Python way. We don't use getters and setters, we use the value itself, and `@property`s when something dynamic is needed. I guess we don't use IOC, either?
Thank you!
I've also got a hard time thinking of a reason to use such a lib in Python. If I really need/want decoupling, I would do something like [this](https://brejoc.com/service-locator-pattern-in-python/).
When you want maintainable code that uses dependencies. That said you absolutely don't need an injection framework. Passing parameters to functions gets you 100% of the way there. Doing so also gives the benefit of playing nice with typing
This is primarily because the blog post was written by a machine learning company. The title is certainly misleading though.

 from pyautogui import moveTo moveTo(343, 1292) It's hard to guess without seeing your script but this would be the basic idea.
To build a machine learning solution, you would have to train it; this would involve exactly what you dread, a lot of going through and manually labeling "biodegradable" and "not biodegradable." For your little example, if a "Pineapple" is classified as a fruit by your classification engine, why not use broader categories? Food and fruits are in general biodegradable.

I find that in some cases french people post *in french* on international forums such as Reddit. Not very common, but it happens. It's as if these people don't *want* people to understand what they write.
 Fruits and vegetables are just a small subset of things that I want to classify . It could include random objects like paper/bottle/cloth etc . So, the only solution is to gather as much images as I can , manually , which should include all the sub categories that I want to detect and then train it ? Isn't there a way to train the classifier with a small subset of images , and then make it learn gradually over a period of time ? 
How does this compare to something like [Injector](http://injector.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) which looks heavier but more flexible (e.g. no global state needed). 
The way it "learns gradually" over time is by being trained; without feedback, it has no way to learn. The way it gets feedback is from you, manually classifying things one at a time.
So any particular classifier to look into ? Also please look at this link - http://icsl.ee.columbia.edu/iot-class/2016fall/group8/ I wanted to do something similar to it. 
Nicely done! I enjoyed seeing the additional parts on entropy, stationary states, etc.
I was under the impression from your post you had selected an engine all ready. Something which classifies all trash this way is likely a bit much for a first project. I would recommend trying a simpler project first. If you continue with this, mirroring their choices isn't a bad plan - Google's Cloud Vision API in particular should be useful.
You would be surprised to see the comment you just replied very much upvoted, until *something* happened at it flipped. (Another fun game for you; Guess what caused it to flip). People are less sensitive to words than you might think. Also, faggot is a good word. Can't really replace it while at the same time expressing the same meaning.
I have the script currently consuming a simple CSV if that helps any dynamics. 
I have done ML algorithms previously .I have experience in regression models . Prior to that , I had also used OpenCv and haar Cascade classifiers to detect and identify customer objects. So , as you see difficulty level of this project is not much of a problem . I have got everything sorted , except the SVM classifier . I have managed to get the google API working and returning me labels almost accurately. I just wanted to know how to start with the SVM classifier so that the labels/images itself can be fed to it to create a model . I am sorry , I should have been more clear with my question . I am lil confused as to how to use those labels to feed SVM classifier . 
You were already downvoted to oblivion before I drew people's attention to your history. Guess what? People don't appreciate random anger about someone's blog post. This guy is taking the time to write a blog post about cool Python libraries, and you just use slurs and rage for no reason. That makes you sound like an asshole. No need to know about your political opinions to downvote you. But they certainly did not help your case... 
Thanks for the suggestion. I'll take it into consideration when I get back to thisproblem. 
Well the author of that library wasted a whole lot of his/her time. The lack of existing DI containers/frameworks should have been a pretty significant clue.
Hahah, my post was up for what, 6 hours before you commented with your hurt feelings? All I know is, it's score was pretty much inverted 1 hour after posting. &gt; No need to know about your political opinions to downvote you. But they certainly did not help your case... Goes to show how well you understand how this "voting" thing is supposed to work.
If you want to believe that you are downvoted only because you are a T_D poster, and not also because people prefer nice and constructive comments rather than flaming and slurs, it's entirely up to you. Let's settle this with the scientific method. Create two new accounts, and post 20 comments with each. With one account, post 20 comments with reasons why you like stuff, without slurs. With the other, post 20 comments saying that you hate stuff and using the word faggot. Report back with the average karma score of each account. But hey, you can also continue to pretend that you are the victim of liberal conspiracies :). Have a nice day nonetheless dude.
&gt; If you want to believe that you are downvoted only because you are a T_D poster, Not at all what I implied. Guess again.
I think the package name is `pyimdb`, not `imdb` (haven't tried, though).
Take a deep breath and re-read the conversation. * You say "I was upvoted until *something*" * I say, assuming that *something* refers to you being a *T_D poster*: "You were already downvoted when I mentioned that you are a T_D poster. You were downvoted because you use an aggressive tone, which is unpleasant. However, you being a T_D poster certainly did not help". * You say "No no no I was upvoted, if you think that I did not get downvoted because of my political opinions you do not understand reddit"... But I never said it did not matter! I even explicitly said it made things worse. However, you are deluded if you think this is the ONLY reason why you were downvoted. Now, another possibility (and if this is the case get some help dude, like yesterday) is that the *something* you referred to was some weasel-word for some grand conspiracy you would be a victim of. 
You want /r/learnpython 
Try pip install imdbpy. Or install from requirements.txt(look on github repo) pip install -r requirements.txt
Oh woops thx will look there!
Many supermarkets have online shopping that provides information about products together with images. You might be able to use this as a training data. 
So would it be right to include varied range of products in my training set ? Ex - apple(fruit) to something very different , say pudding ? 
Jake always produces great work. His blog is spectacular! Read the blog archive if you liked this article.
Annnnnd now I'm in love with tenacity. I wrote my own `retry` and this is just wayyyy better.
It's weird because there is a lot a french forums where we can ask or post for a french community, and in general people who are on an international (so english speaking) forum can understand english, so I don't understand why they would do such a thing. In addition, Reddit is not very popular in France..
Who knows! The world has an awful lot of online grocery stores though: https://www.sainsburys.co.uk/shop/gb/groceries/bananas-grapes/sainsburys-fairtrade-bananas-x5

Did you call your script `pyautogui.py` by any chance?
Oh wow. Yes I did! Thanks! :)
That's a good question! Injector is great but I personally a little but annoyed by the following reasons: * It uses type annotations to inject. While it's a great idea on its own, sometimes you need few configurations (or instances) for the same type. Injector suggests to create a fake type, and use that fake type in type annotation to inject (imho, a little bit confusing). * Injector can inject only to class' `__init__` while I (again, personally) pretty often use functions in my code and sometimes just want to pass something to it.
/r/learnpython for this.
I'm on chapter 4 (working with lists) in "Python Crash Course" by Eric Matthes. I am learning my first programming language and taking my time to do all the exercises...
Hi, cool stuff! Are there any benchmarks against Kafka or Redis streaming? Or do you position yourself more as complementary?
Hah, good call
Hi etano, Thanks! I work at Wallaroo Labs. We don't have any benchmarks against Kafka Streaming or Redis Streaming. While for some small segment of use cases, we could be seen as competitors, we think for the vast majority of them, that Kakfa and Redis are complementary technologies.
These are awesome! Somehow missed these, so thanks for sharing :)
Maybe just to be annoying. Btw, this username seems to be chosen to be as lamest as possible. 
(Apologies if this is condescending, but someone might find it useful.) Finding the shortest possible game is a pretty straightforward breadth-first search (BFS) on a digraph. Create 100 vertices (plus one for a starting point), each has an edge to the next six, plus an edge for every chute and every ladder, then find a route from the start vertex to the final square.
i prefer hotdog and not hotdog
Looks like there's a lot of similarities to [streamparse](https://github.com/Parsely/streamparse) / Storm, and perhaps Spark Streaming. Could you tell me about some key differentiators between Wallaroo and those?

hey thank you for your help now the thing I'm working on changed to having first name, last name, city, and state all put together how would you write that to where it sorts by first name and another time to sort by last name and keep it all connected? 
Sure, but you get shortest possible game for free from the matrix analysis, which you need to do to get the more interesting tidbits.

Well if there isn't a better time to be using it's other name...Snakes and Ladders
A non-extensive list: Spark Streaming is (currently) microbatch based rather than event-by-event streaming. Both Wallaroo and Storm are event-by-event based. Spark Streaming is more analgous to Storm's Trident than either Storm or Wallaroo. Streamparse requires you to run Storm. Storm is JVM based so you'll need to be at least familiar with the JVM. Data routing is done in JVM processes and then moved back and forth between the JVM process(es) and Python processes. Wallaroo embeds a Python interpreter into the same process. There's no marshalling of data between JVM/Python process. Data might need to need to be moved between members of a distributed cluster but, if you have 1 cluster of 1, that means 1 single process. That's a core difference that leads to the ability to do different things. Wallaroo has builtin in-memory state where the application programmer can define arbitrary data objects that are kept in memory. Wallaroo manages those objects so that, they can be backedup and restored in the case of failure. Additionally, if you grow or shrink your cluster size, Wallaroo handles where in the cluster your individual bits of data live. There are a couple more posts on our blog that are a good intro: Wallaroo basics: https://blog.wallaroolabs.com/2017/03/hello-wallaroo/ Introduction to Scale Independent APIs: https://vimeo.com/234753585 Introduction to the Python API: https://blog.wallaroolabs.com/2017/10/go-python-go-stream-processing-for-python/

Correct. Most of the time you don't need any injection framework. Especially when you are working with web-frameworks where some sort of application/request context storage are available. DI frameworks are handy when you have one helluva project with huge code base and complex architecture since they allow you to do not pass down the stack parameters complicating your interfaces but inject them on-demand. 
SqlAlchemy is a imdbpy's dependency... But that error is a result of that UnicodDecodeError. You can also try to install Sql alchemy separately via '*pip install sqlalchemy*'. Though I don't think this will solve your problem. 
Start with free online courses like codeacademy and see how you like it.
&gt; If I really need/want decoupling, I would do something like this. Service Locator is an alternative approach to do decoupling. Both DI and Service Locator has its own pros and cons. I can say for sure one thing: Picobox, for instance, allows you to partially override your dependencies in tests while in case of ServiceLocator you will end up with mocking the code (which is not bad itself but might be error prone).
Of course anything by Hettinger or Beazley. The one that helped me understand asyncio the bets [was this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-UcUs7IMIM). Of course I saw that before [Beazley's talk on coroutines](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_OAlIhXziw).
I tried installing form the requirements text and got this UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0xe1 in position 20: invalid continuation byte
could it be a 32bit vs 64bit python install thing?
i ve been building a python command line app to explore google's tensorflow image classification library -- make it easy to download loads of images, auto-sort them, use them to retrain a classifier, which in turn makes for better sorting, retraining, etc. i JUST posted it to github and would love any feedback from how the app works for ya, to how the readme works (tooo much info, too little). its at https://github.com/mariochampion/roboflow and issues, PRs, comments are totally welcome!
No it's encoding error, did you run *'chcp'* cmd. It will tell you the code page..... You can change code page to UTF 8 by running '*chcp 65001*' cmd. Read about it [here] (https://technet.microsoft.com/en-in/library/bb490874.aspx)

Perhaps slightly off topic, this article seems to be a converted Jupyter notebook, but the style/ css seems nicely merged with the sites. Just today I have been struggling with this problem, where I either get too little detail with the basic template, and overbearing css with the full template. What's your secret... have I missed something? (assuming OP is the author, or anyone out there knows!)
As a person with no prior programming experience, I've found CodeAcademy ( www.codeacademy.com ) extremely useful with getting the basics of the language. The problems came after finishing the course - I did know how to perform specific operations, but I had no idea whatsover where and how I could actually use them, apart from writing a simple terminal-based application. This is where Udemy should come in handy with its video tutorials. Most of my doubts disappeared after finding my first job as a developer, where I applied all of the CodeAcademy knowledge to a real-life project. Since this is not an option for you, I highly recommend asking your friends (or fellow redditors) who program in Python - maybe some of them need help in one of their projects? 
This has nothing to do with static versus dynamic typing. Java specifically implements the `+` operation for `String` with other types. Whether that's a good idea or not is a different question, but that example is still statically typechecked in Java.
Continuing to work on [CodeClippy](https://www.solutionloft.com/codeclippy) using both JS and django, but the majority of the community are Python devs. 
Probably best not to try to impose JavaScript semantics and idioms onto Python - it has its own. You already know how to do your current project in JS, and it seems that you are trying to transliterate this into Python. You probably just need to see how others do that kind of thing in Python. It may help if you can state what you are trying to *do* and why you feel you need this particular JS feature to do it - you may not. You can quite easily code a multi-type tree structure in Python without referring to `__getattribute__()` but you may have to write your code in a way that feels alien from your JS-centric perspective. Generally speaking, when you are messing with dunders (`__something__`) you are messing with the internals of Python - there are a few exceptions, like the `if __name__ == '__main__'` import guard, but generally, if you're doing this, you're doing something "clever" - and something that may not continue to work in the future. It is *possible* that the only way to do what you want is via accessing the internals, but unless it's something special, it's unlikely.
Well this is interesting and horrifying :-) Maybe primers [classes](https://docs.python.org/3.6/tutorial/classes.html) and the [data model](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html) can convince you that differentiating between the two can be useful. Of course only when you understand why both exist :-)
Yes, it is not about static and dynamic, you are right. See the gist title rather :) It is example of https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Null-References-The-Billion-Dollar-Mistake-Tony-Hoare 
It's also not an example of that, or at least it doesn't really paint Python in much of a different light. `None` in Python is the same thing as `null` in Java, really, and is handled much in the same way. For a different approach entirely, look at how Rust uses its `Option` and `Result` types.
Absolutely not! What a weird suggestion to make. I see that my post was more than necessary. Python correctly distinguished types. It is dynamically and strong typed. One would think that my posted example would be enough to explain that difference. Rust uses Option and Result because it is statically typed and correctly typed I have to add. Python is dynamically typed so you dont need to let compiler let know in advance what you intented. But there is no way in Python to change any object to None. None is all the time completely different type and reference. 
I know how Python names work, they're just not the issue here. The issue with `null` isn't that null exists, the issue is that it's treated just like any other value, and can pop up in places you don't expect it to. Python does nothing to solve that. 
Oh my, in my post I have just show you, you get runtime exception while java with its inferior typing happily goes through. Rust or any modern static typed language would catch such mistake on compile time. My intention was to show how dangerous might be in Java to rely on static typing bacause Java has very basic flaw in its design compared to Python.
Java doesn't have "inferior typing". The type system itself has nothing to do with it at all. The addition operation is defined weirdly on strings, but that has nothing to do with nulls or the type system. You can even implement your own String class that won't have that issue. 
If you say so.
[Here is another good tall from David Beazley](https://youtu.be/MCs5OvhV9S4)
&gt; hypothesis This is a really cool library that definitely helps harden an application BUT I still have a hard time with comprehending it enough to work with it. When its blows up during testing, I know something is wrong, but sometimes not specifically what (if that makes sense).
Let me know if you got any bites on this. I'd like to find a tutor also. If we can't find a tutor maybe we can find a project to start working on together.
How do you do it? (Also tbh I haven't seen the article yet)
Very cool. A good friend of mine did an identical exercise with Monopoly, demonstrating how you can simulate it with linear algebra using a transition matrix (including the decks of cards as well). 
Python doesn't analyze your data out-of-the-box, it's a toolkit to implement solutions for data driven questions. You have to know well how to solve problems and you can use python for conversion. If you just want to analyze your data pool, there are lots of production-grade ETL tools out there that do not require programming skills. Nevertheless, CodeAcademy is a good choice for first steps.

Just add them as arguments to zip. from operator import itemgetter first = ['John', 'Guido', 'Jane'] last = ['Doe', 'van Rossum', 'Doe'] city = ['London', 'New York', 'London'] state = ['GB', 'NY', 'GB'] combined = zip(first, last, city, state) people = sorted(combined, key=itemgetter(0, 1)) print(people) If you for example want to sort on state and after on last name use: people = sorted(combined, key=itemgetter(3, 1))
How do you do what?
Th...that's python?
Reddit is such a fickle place. [I posted this same link 2 days ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/7ko08b/simulating_chutes_ladders_in_python/) with limited success. The article is great. I really dug it. 
Thanks! I'll have to give it a try. +1 to using ducker for a quickstart example.
How do you find the "shortest possible game for free from the matrix analysis"? What are the steps needed? What is the matrix analysis that one needs to do?
Try `python -m pip install &lt;library&gt;`. Then you know python is using the right pip
If you haven't already, try posting this to r/learnpython. r/python isn't really geared toward this kind of thing.
Without commenting on the quality of the tutorial, I found 'Flask web app development with Miguel Grinberg' to be a superior trivia name
I go on mcmasters carr’s website often and would like to mess around with it using python too. I’m not familiar with webdriver. Are you creating a search box?
&gt; But perhaps the less-known usage of Python is its use as a web server. Overshadowed by more popular frameworks like as Node/Express and Ruby on Rails, Python is often overlooked as a web server choice for most developers. Hahahhahahahahahahahhahahaha
Tools-&gt;Preferences gives you the configuration screen, which has a font selector on the General tab.
This makes no sense. Racism is an aspect of culture.

Yes
Safaribooks has a trial period before they bill so just go fo it. You can take the whole course in this mode.
Yes, this looks super duper crazy. :) There are several things that are fundamentally wrong, but I can see a sincere effort in there, so I'm confident you will get it. If I had to guess, you have attempted to write code by referencing very isolated documentation on specific features of the object model, but you really need to go through a linear, ordered learning approach to the object model. Specifically, I think you need to learn about **classes** in python. "Dunder" methods in python aren't really **called**. Rather, they are **defined** within a class in order to dictate how the class instance behaves. You do call those classes, but you do so indirectly through python syntax. So for example, __getitem__() is defined within the scope of a class to determine the behavior of the square brackets []. In a python class, you can make the object do whatever you want with that syntax by defining __getitem__(). Likewise, __getattr__ **defines** the behavior of calling obj.whatever. It could produce the exact same result as __getitem__, or it could produce something entirely different. In the code excerpt above, you spend most of your effort trying to make sure that the appropriate method is called, but they simply are not contingency plans for one another in the way you are trying to use them. Scrap it, use codeacademy or something, and start again. But don't feel bad. You obviously dug around pretty deeply to produce the result you did. As a python programmer trying to get into C# and javascript, I understand how you feel. It's tedious to go back to basics, but you can't get over confident and bypass the basics. 
If you change the contents of a file without changing the name or size, will it get synced? How are you checking for changed files?
The power of positive feedback loops. If a link catches the first tiny bit of traction, then it snowballs big time. Links are either blockbusters or washouts which don't necessarily have to do with the quality of link but just random factors at the time of link posting. 
I'm a noob, so could be totally wrong here but- Looks like he is just checking if the file/folder exists when determining what the sync. In the file_sync func, he is calling os.path.isdir() and os.path.isfile() which only check if it exists. Would be cool to sync based on file size or last modification date. Otherwise, this is pretty cool for a first project OP; well done!
Php
I am comparing files using the filecmp.cmp() method from the [filecmp](https://docs.python.org/2/library/filecmp.html) library. It is using the shallow compare type. I have found it to be very accurate and quick at determining if files similarly named have different content.
Not sure why you are laughing, but it is true that Python takes a backseat to frameworks like Express and Ruby on Rails in terms of popularity. It's not that Python is unheard of, but it's not overwhelmingly common. Even then, you are more likely to see a Django installation than a Flask one.
BTW, the dropbox api gives you a hash if you ever want to verify file contents. &gt; In order to allow API apps to verify uploaded contents or compare remote files to local files without downloading them, the FileMetadata object contains a hash of the file contents in the content_hash property. https://www.dropbox.com/developers/reference/content-hash
The main reason for this project was to sync data from my folder to my local hard drive dropbox folder. As I couldn't figure out a way to have dripbox desktop sync pointed at a network drive.
Thanks for sharing. My company provides free Safaribooks membership to all employees. I will take this up.
Oof, i dont know how the "incredibly" stuff slipped past me, but fixed. And sorry you felt that way about the article. anything I could have done better? re your quote: just looking at stackoverflow stats, flask + django tags don't appear _nearly_ as often as the other frameworks mentioned.
I agree that "Flask web app development ..." is a good name (and was really in line with what I had originally, but FreeCodeCamp edited it to appeal to their beginner audience.
I live in Germany 
I've just started using flask and I thought this article was quite helpful. I wasn't bothered by your use of incredibly either.

Python 2? yuck! haha Can this be transferred to Python 3 pretty easily? I would love to start messing around with blockchain concepts

Meefims' question valid. SA's session query result objects are not simple lists, so using del is not appropriate. If your intent is to delete the row in your table, use the SA methods provided for session objects Also, using session.commit() inside your for loop is not necessary. Outside will suffice, but I strongly advise a try/except block around any flush() or commit(); too much can go wrong. 
Thanks :)
Raymond's courses are always great, he knows Python like the back of his hand and is a core developer, he is also a good teacher and entertaining speaker. I give intermediate level talks several times a year and often recommend his youtube videos as 'homework' for the audience who want to learn more. This actually looks like something I'll watch in the downtime around the holidays. A Safari membership has proven well worth the money imo, although they occasionally have sales for half price membership so maybe wait for after the holidays and use the free trial for now? Also many public libraries or school libraries have access or will get it for you upon request.
It seems to be back to normal now from my side. Is the problem still there for you? I am surprised to hear that this happened to you a few days ago. I have been visiting this page almost daily since Saturday. Tonight was the first time I ran into this issue. It might be some intermittent issue.
It appears to be a [bug in the build process](https://bugs.python.org/issue31584) but one that's hard to catch on the act. It's been going on for a while, and then a fresh full build happens and the various CDN caches expire and it goes away.
get ipython to try simple things
Yes, absolutely. Visual Studio is a really heavy IDE though - you might want to try something more lightweight like Sublime Text or Visual Studio Code. Also, /r/learnpython is a better place for questions like these ;)
He's re-writing it too right now. A new lesson every week with the third lesson released yesterday.
Thank you *hides*
You can typically do Python development on pretty much any machine, it certainly shouldn't slow anything down significantly. I wouldn't say the same about Visual Studio, which is pretty heavyweight. Many IDEs do a heck of a lot of background scanning when they first load up, building up a database skeleton for their code completion... when I was using PyCharm regularly it'd do this any time the project interpreter was changed or set, and I'd just have to walk away from the machine for a while. Typically this doesn't happen often though.
Naive question but is there a reason that there's so many ML in the top 10?
Yeah, cool article but fix those print statements. It was cool though

For windows, install anaconda, much easier to deal with as everything is in one place, spyder(ide) , cmd line, launcher and libraries for days. You can choose python 2.7 or python 3.6. It installs very nicely and won't mess with any other python you have on the system as anaconda is contained. 
I wish they would add some Python and Flask or Django to the fCC map. 
That's gonna be a bit anticlimactic. I was under the impression that what OP wanted was a demo/solution that uses a "while True:" and dint think further that that.
Another note--you mention Django... Django classes inherit from other abstract classes within the framework, and therefore behave in a very specific way which is highly intuitive for the interface they are modeling (such as a database record)--but very different from a normal python class. Understand python, then learn Django.
Well done for doing something and keeping positive. Some would rather criticise than contribute. Don't let it get to you. 
I just bought the ebook to support him a little and to have it at my convenience right now. And because I am somewhat of a impulsive shopping type.

That's one reason why I use WingIDE. It was fine on a slow laptop back in 2010 and it's still fine now.

Great question! First, I simply didn't know about giveme when I started hacking Picobox. :) Sorry about that. I just took a look at giveme and I can say that it's very similar to some ideas behind Picobox. However here's the main difference: * GiveMe (as far as I get) requires you to create a global injector instance while Picobox does not (see Picobox stack interface). * GiveMe doesn't have "scope" concept, it's hardcoded for 2 most common cases: singleton and threadlocal. * GiveMe doesn't allow you (at least I didn't find in docs) to *override* dependencies in tests.
Awesome thanks for the tip :)
- why should you specifically use IronPython for this? Regular Python implementations have ODBC modules as well - look up ``flask`` to make a dynamic web site in Python.
I cannot personally attest to the racial situation in Germany but as an American it just seems hysterical to me that someone would find implicit racial bias to be strange or unthinkable
It's rewritten at this point.
This is awesome, but why you didn't rsync, special tool to do this work? 
Great idea. I will do that and post a review after!
Coming from academia myself, I made the same transition. If it's MATLAB specific functions that you need in python, the packages `numpy`, `scipy` and `matplotlib` may provide you with some 'known' functions as they cover many, if not most of MATLABs built-in functions. Careful with arrays though, as MATLAB uses F-style ordering (Fortran), while numpy by default uses C-style ordering, meaning that when working with coordinates/n dimensional matrices, you may run into errors or strange behaviour which can be fixed by reversing the axes.
Haven't read the article yet but don't listen to that bundleofdicks person, he seems like an incredibly big asshat. Thanks for taking the time to write the article!
You can use hashlib’s md5. If the file is too big to be loaded into memory you need to load it in chunks. If you do this, even if 1 bit is different, you’ll know.
What I'm doing is using python to scrape the pertinent data on specific hardware and create a standard description used with the part numbers at work. Basically trying to automate the process of creating at part number at work 
If you want to know if this is a direction you should go, why not start with the [Official Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3.6/tutorial/) and go from there?
Are you interested in critique?
I was JUST given the assignment to learn python, flask, etc for development at my work. As a junior programmer who needed this, thank you and I can’t wait to give this a read today :)
Of course, everything that I can learn from is welcome.
I'm not an expert, but on the PyCoin's GitHub site, they list the developer's email address several times. He's probably the greatest authority you could find. https://github.com/richardkiss/pycoin
Cool. :-) `create_folder` checks for errors, as it should, and reports those to the user, but not to the calling code, which then can't check whether the directory was successfully created. Another thing is that it's not wise to form paths manually: img.save(drc + '/' + str(idx) + '.jpg') Try from os.path import join img.save(join(drc, str(idx) + '.jpg')) The rest of my comments are mostly style related. Instead of double-indenting your main logic, I find this pattern to be more pleasing: if not check_args(sys.argv): sys.exit(1) # ... Instead of nums = sys.argv[2].split('x') images = crop(int(nums[0]), int(nums[1]), input_image) consider for example width, height = map(int, sys.argv[2].split('x')) images = crop(width, height, input_image)
I have re-done the app using PyQt5 and used about the same number of code lines. I've updated the blog post and also created a [GitHub repository] where you can see how I've done it. I agree that the PyQt5 TableWidget is better than building a grid of text boxes, but in the end you still have to work through the calculation logic and figure out how to get events to fire correctly. So for this particular experiment, PyQt5 did not show a benefit.
Good point – I probably should have added it to the post, but you can do this directly using the transition matrix as a sparse graph: mat = cl_markov_matrix() indices, predecessors = shortest_path(mat.T, indices=0, directed=True, unweighted=True, return_predecessors=True) path = [100] while path[0] &gt; 0: path.insert(0, predecessors[path[0]]) print(path) The result is [0, 38, 39, 45, 67, 70, 75, 100] though I think that other length-7 paths exist as well.
&gt; hon. IronPython has a helpers 'shim' (stored procs) baked in. http://ciscounitytools.com/Applications/CxN/PythonScriptingHost/PythonScriptingHost.html I assume I can use Cypthon with a CLR/.NET libraries? 
The service provides a “Helpers” shim that gives access to all the power, performance and flexibility of the full ODBC and HTTP interfaces into Unity Connection with very little overhead and a simplified API that is easy to use from within Python’s scripting environment. It also includes file reading/creating methods for simplified CSV handling, full database query and update abilities and includes the ability to fetch and upload media files to and from Connection for greetings, voice names, interview questions etc…
Try the coursera specialization "Python For Everybody". It's a 5-course specialization on the most of python, from the basics to integrating it with SQL. It **IS** paid.

/r/learnpython
This is awesome! I really appreciate your remarks!
Get a book from /r/learnpython wiki and enjoy the ride. There's no magical way to learn it. You also may be a person that learns better from videos, so you can try that too. There's courses that are free or you can go to Lynda and pick one there. As far as I'm concerned - books are the way to go. 
Literally the example case for namedtuple. https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/collections.html#collections.namedtuple One of the benefits of unnamed tuples (in my opinion) is that they can more easily be conceived of as isomorphic to other tuples of similar length. This is, occasionally, insightful.
&gt; support of all the basic operators, some additional functions such as Euclidean norm, for and cross product. Though, this wouldn't come for free with named tuples, obviously. Do you need a class that supports those operations, or is a functional approach workable for you? 
If you really wanted a GUI, you should have just wrapped rsync in one.

Why exactly do you insist on having x and y as properties? :)
Okay, I stand corrected. Awesome.
There's not a built in. There's various ones on PyPI. I've got a 2d one for games up there `ppb_vector`. I don't know if it has all of the things you want, but you can [check that out](https://github.com/ppb/ppb-vector).
Ah, nicely done, I mis understood the question, apologies if my answer was misleading, but yes, you are always going to have to go through the logic yourself, tk and qt are simply GUI wrappers that python can use. On the whole, I use Tkinter for simple things, where just simple data entry or a pop up box is needed, but has to be something like qt for a full blown applications. 
You can use `sys` to make a directory to localize your files, then delete or save after your program exits. That's probably the best approach, I'd compare it to separation of concerns. That way, there's very little chance of any other process messing with your data, and you can run the program multiple times simultaneously and not worry about them looking at the wrong files. Making and deleting directories is lightning fast anyway, so there isn't really a draw-back. 
Yes, excellent course, I got a lot out of it.
In the first sentence I quoted, you're conflating three different things: python, web frameworks like rails, and web servers. Python has been a very popular language for web applications for many many years. Django (predates Rails), Tornado, Zope, Flask, etc. It's not overlooked at all.
Another thing is that it's not wise to form paths manually: All glory to pathlib! from pathlib import Path img.save(Path(drc) / str(idx) + '.jpg')
That usually means you named your file iosxr_eznc.py, so the program is trying to import itself. If not, try /r/learnpython. Include the full error, and which version of python and what OS you are using.

I just made Turtle work on running a saved file! I programmed an octagon :)
Better ask on learnpython. Have a look at flask
Try asking this in r/learnpython
Use tempfiles and/or temporary directories. That way even if your program doesn't exit cleanly or just dies without cleanup you can at least be reasonably certain that they'll get cleaned up by the system eventually. 
Thanks, I just started with python and flask, and found this tutorial to be helpful! 
This is my code, really simple. import mouse import time import keyboard import random pos2 = mouse.get_position() while True: pos1 = mouse.get_position() if pos1 != pos2: mouse.move(random.randint(0, 1920), random.randint(0, 1080), absolute=True, duration=0.1) pos2 = mouse.get_position() if keyboard.is_pressed('p') == True: break
one thing I notice is that you do conn.commit() inside the try/catch, and then outside in the finally:, you do it again. if conn.commit() is failing, then the transaction will remain opened and your connection will not be closed. I would take conn.commit() out of the finally: block. Next, run your program, let it hang, then go psql and run SELECT * from pg_stat_activity to view what queries are waiting on locks, should provide a hint as to what's going on. Also look into pg_locks to view specific locks. See [Lock Monitoring](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Lock_Monitoring) for further detail.
I know it gets posted allot on this sub-reddit but Raymoned Hettiger's talk: 'Beyond pep8' is what opened my eyes to what good python should look like. He has another talk called 'Transforming code into beautiful, idiomatic python' that goes into more specifics. Both can be found on YouTube 
Thanks, I'll try this out!!
Yeah, I'm mainly a windows user. As I get accustomed to using Linux maybe I will find some uses. Thanks. 
I went through it, I have also recommended it before in a similar thread. It's very nice and versatile. It mainly goes through an api creation in python 3.5. Also, I would recommend to sign up with a disposable email to avoid the spam and sign again if you need to access after you trial period. 
Any kind of Python script development/backend of a web app is what I am looking for. I have experience in Python, Django, MySQL, Postgresql, HDF5. I know some of the libraries like pandas, numpy, openpyxl, urllib, requests and so on. I am also a quick learner on libraries. Feel free to contact me on my email: lakhanpandya91@gmail.com
It's not getting accustomed to Linux, but rather just getting over Windows' slow process spawning and monolothic no delegation of work to other processes mentality. Think of subprocesses as just another form of function call or server.
Yes tempfiles sound like a perfect fit. I believe they can be used in conjunction with "with/open" statements for added cleanup protection.
Yep! Word of caution, TemporaryDirectory can be used with context managers as well but are *not* removed when the context is released. You have to call cleanup() on them once they're done. I might have exhausted the number of inodes on a server once by not doing this. 
I didn't look into it much, but a brief stackoverflow search seems to indicate this has been fixed in newer versions of python. Thanks for the tip though. I'll be be sure to keep an eye out for this when I use temps next.
Check if you can add other modules when you are freezing. If you can add `encoding.utf-8˙(not 100% sure about the name)
I used learn python the hard way years ago. I'm unsure if it's still around or if it's used much anymore. 
Depending on what you want to learn it for, I'd clone [flasky!](https://github.com/miguelgrinberg/flasky) and just start writing an app and using it for reference. Building apps is a great way to go, but a blog is the canonical example application. If you want to build a different type of app, figuring out the models and wiring up routes/templates becomes more rote as you go. I don't see people every suggesting this type of learning, but this is what I did and it worked really well. (I read the companion book as well.) Building something for the first time will probably be painful. The second time you'll find that things aren't so new and you understand more. One of my managers compared coding to driving a car once (for applications that use lots of CRUD, at least). I think that's a apt comparison. Miguel Grinberg also has a blog with a free course in a blog format for learning Flask. I'd strongly recommend learning Flask for any type of Python application you'd like to build. For instance, I just do mostly backend software engineering, but data scientists I've worked with will still need to set up a DB connection and maybe set up some routes to make GET requests to load lots of JSON they can use to feed into a predictive model.
There is also pycharm but it can be heavy too. I havent used it in a few years. Sublime or vim or atom are lighter choices. Vim would probably be too much for learning to program.
On my phone _but_ it looks like the final html is rendered via JS. it's probably an angular app. So the data might be in JSON and you could utilize but likely you'll need to make sure the DOM is fully rendered. Selenium or PhantomJS would be best. Chrome has a headless support so you might be able to get it to render the full page then use the typical html parsing tools.
Just to chime in, [SpooledTemporaryFile](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tempfile.html#tempfile.SpooledTemporaryFile) is amazing for when you want to have temporary files with the performance of in memory file-like objects but don't want the hastle of worrying about running out of memory.
This is so cool! And would be even better if you made a video that showed how he creatures behave after a number of epochs. I don't know about others, but I _adore_ watching videos of AI learning and performing better and better after each epoch!
Cool! You should also post this to /r/alife. To make it more realistic, you could implement a decrease in energy depending on velocity, so that movement takes energy. Then also have the current food store / fitness be an input node. It'd be interesting if that information got used correctly, so that cells would only move towards food that will give them more energy than they used to get to them.
Thanks! And I plan on uploading a longer animation to YouTube here in a few hours...

I am happy to announce the revival of the AggDraw project and the release of version 1.3. This release is the first official PyPI release in over 12 years. Most importantly this release adds Python 3 support. AggDraw is a high-quality graphics engine for PIL, based on Maxim Shemanarev's Anti-Grain Geometry library (from http://antigrain.com). The original author, effbot, was unable to continue maintaining the project quite a few years ago. After the project stopped being maintained many developers forked the project and started their own additions and modifications. In an effort consolidate and revive the project for those that needed it the PyTroll group of developers have taken over maintainership. If anyone has an interest in joining us in maintaining the project let us know on our mailing list or slack: http://pytroll.github.io/ Release notes: https://github.com/pytroll/aggdraw/blob/master/CHANGES Documentation: http://effbot.org/zone/pythondoc-aggdraw.htm GitHub/Bug Tracker: https://github.com/pytroll/aggdraw PyPI: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/aggdraw -AggDraw Developers

This is awesome! Maybe we can find out the origin of life or at least its early stages because of a Python code. 
You did a great job with this. I think it's interesting the way you've chosen to structure the inputs and information each organism has. The output layer is a change in direction and a change in speed. While each organism does have all the directional information it needs since the input is given relative to it's current heading, it doesn't consider how fast it's already moving, as there is no input neuron to consider this. You can kind of see in the final figure, an outcome I'd expect from this, which is that each organism chooses to keep it's speed pretty much constant even to it's own detriment. There is one on the far left that spends half of its life circling a food but going too fast to actually move closer to it, there are others that start relatively far from food that just inch along and never actually reach it. 
That is class, very nice work. 
Since energy consumption is not considered in this initial version, the GA should simply maximized this neuron output and travel at 100% of top speed all the time. And you're correct in regards to the circling organisms, that's rally just a function of the maximum turning speed (d_r) being too low given its current velocity. A higher turning rate or a slower velocity would correct for this. It is strange how many organisms are still fairly unfit relative to the best ones. I was thinking it was a result of merging two drastically different neural network weight matrices together which produced rubbish... 
Have you checked out numpy?
I would recommend Udacity's introduction courses to Python. You usually learn the basics of the language AND programming techniques at the same time while building something interesting (when they started one would build a web search with webcrawler etc. Don't know if it's still the same.)
A lot. Why? 
It sounds like the process that you're polling doesn't actually own the calculator window. It either launches another process or tells an existing process to display a calculator window, then exits. Try printing the process id (`calcProc.pid`) immediately after you launch the subprocess. Compare that to the PID that Task Manager gives you for the calculator. If they're different, that'll confirm what's going on.
Only when prototyping. Those little shortcuts might be nice to get something going, but are ugly and sometimes not as intuitive as it’s refactored counterpart. Just a general piece of advice when trying to use ALL the idioms/idiosyncrasies/generally tricky features of any language: Beginners write simple code. Intermediate devs write complex code. Experts write simple code.
There are some really nice plot on this blog, but many of them without (Python) code and if there is code it is only on Google Drive.
I rather like list comprehensions and use them whenever I can. 
Awesome! I did something like this a while back but it took forever for the organisms to stop just running in circles. Maybe I'll try again.
!remindme 10 hours 
List comps: If it's simple enough, I'll use a list comp 100% of the time. Regex: Yeah when it makes sense Lambda: Yes, only if the lambda really is a one-liner, otherwise make a function.

List comprehension: Almost always. I sometimes do double comprehensions, even though they aren't as readable and probably mean I should change my data structure. Regex: That's task dependent. Unless you're interfacing with data you don't generate, there's not much reason to use them. Lambda functions: A bunch when doing min/max/map/sorted, or for making a list comprehension line shorter (such as [x for x in thing if lambda_func(x)]. 
The most fun of that might be going back and seeing who was right/wrong the most.

About two years ago I used that book to learn enough to get a job! Keep at it, it's a great starting point. Have to come up with any "moonshot" projects you want to work towards implementing?
Although I'm not local to the area, I love helping people reach their Python related goals! A little background: I manage the development shop for a team of 40ish people, and I love introducing people to modern development process - if you're open to doing something remote (using Skype or hangouts or something similar) I'm very willing to hear your goals and see if I can help. PM me if you (or whomever is reading this) is interested.
I like the master/minion model a bit more than straight push. salt-cloud is also a big selling point for me. There's so much under the hood than just the configuration management bits. I don't mind/have anything against ansible and have put time into learning it as well (I manage my public webserver/sites with it). Puppet and Chef lose points with me because of Ruby (also, you literally can't Google anything in the chef eco-system easily).
This is oldish but I'm using Kivy with Python 3.

Hi there, from the /r/Python mods. We have removed this post as it is not suited to the /r/Python subreddit proper, however it should be very appropriate for our sister subreddit /r/LearnPython. We **highly encourage** you to re-submit your post over on there. The reason for the removal is that /r/Python is dedicated to discussion of Python news, projects, uses and debates. It is not designed to act as Q&amp;A or FAQ board. The regular community is not a fan of "how do I..." questions, so you will not get the best responses over here. On /r/LearnPython the community is actively expecting questions and are looking to help. You can expect far more understanding, encouraging and insightful responses over there. No matter what level of question you have, if you are looking for help with Python, you should get good answers. If you have a question to do with homework or an assignment of any kind, please make sure to read their sidebar rules **before** submitting your post.

[This SO post seems good](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46725396/python-pil-fill-an-image-with-a-color-outline), just googled "python flood fill image"
I'm Python Software Eng, I work with Python almost 10 years an I have never used anything else than pip + virtualenv. My user env contains only pip and virtualenv packages. Any other packages I need to install are in the virtualenvs. But in case I need to install MySQL or similar which requires special c libraries or any client I use vagrant with Ubuntu VM or docker container with Ubuntu.
You could write a class to store a numpy array or just use pandas, which uses xarray under the hood. If you're dealing with a large amount of data, you're literally slowing your program down by 500x by not using something like numpy.
yes
just inner product layers? that's not deep learning bud. 
I've tried using Tools &gt; Preferences &gt; General &gt; Appearances. But it doesn't affect the font in the Editor or in the IPython shell. Only the code in the "Help" dialogue changes.

Thanks, didn't realize it was a gihub link. Anyway, what would need to be done to animate this in real time? I'm not familiar at all with Python graphics.
These are my suggestions from years of scientific computing in python. If it's windows use anaconda. Last I checked there were a few scientific packages without pypi binary wheels for windows and scavenging all of the dependencies to build your own packages on windows is a major PITA. If it's a mac use [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) (aka brew) to install the latest python and any dependencies If it's linux, it depends entirely on the distro. If it's a rolling distro that always has up-to-date packages (e.g. arch, tumbleweed, etc.) just use the package manager. If it's a long-term release distro (e.g. centos, ubuntu lts, etc.), then ask yourself why you are developing on it... then get the base dependencies using the package manager and compile python from source. In both latter cases (anaconda manages its own environments) always use venv to manage your environments
This is really cool, very impressive to implement such a thing. But as a genuine question, does it really need a NN to determine the closest food source - shouldn't it just determine the shortest hypotenuse and angle within a realistic range of itself? 
With this power you could become the agar.io world champion.
Also ask them to ensure access to the conda repos. This may need changes on the proxy/firewall. If this is possible, think about using miniconda instead of anaconda.
The font used for console windows and code is the "Plain text font", not the "Rich text font".
Great summary. Some of those were new to me, so thanks!
List comprehensions: very often, when they make things more readable. They read almost like English, so that's a lot of the time. Regex: often. I dislike Python's re library, because it's overly complicated and unintuitive (much like datetime) but regex is life. Lambdas: rarely. I prefer to define functions separately, for readability. One way i do this is define my pseudo lambda function inside of another function's scope where it's used. That gives me the convenience of a normal function declaration, near where it's used, without polluting the main scope. Something like this: def do_stuff(my_list): def pseudo_lambda(x): return "x is", x return [ pseudo_lambda(x) for x in my_list ]
I want to be able to easily access and modify x and y values. I want to avoid using [0] and [1] indexing as in NumPy - if I have for example a list of vectors, or a list of lists of vectors, the code becomes very difficult to read. Also, I want to be clear about the coordinate system. For example, when you use a functions from the OpenCV library which has a vertex (or vertices) as its output, these are indexed such that [0] is the column and [1] is the row. However, when you use NumPy functions like argwhere, the output is such that [0] is the row and [1] is the column. It's not difficult to swap the coordinates, I would need to do it anyway before initializing vector class that I'm looking for. But I feel that if I had a class with named members x and y, it would 1) simplify indexing, 2) indicate that if I had an instance, the x is always horizontal axis coordinate and y is the vertical. 
QA and devops engineers' opinions on code quality don't mean much. Software isn't really their domain of expertise. Source: me, a software engineer who's spent the last few years doing 80% devops and has only ever met one QA engineer who wasn't utterly incompetent at writing software.
I need at least the basic operators (+, -, *, /). Other operations, like the vector norm, dot, cross product and anything else could be defined in the separate functions. 
Interesting, I'll check it out!
List comprehensions: all the time. regex: all the time when I'm web scraping, not very often otherwise lambdas:not very often. the most likely situation is something like `sorted(some_list, key=lambda x: x[1])`
Yes, NumPy is problematic because of indexing. Is there a way to add x and y properties to numpy.ndarray so that these would access [0] and [1] indices of the array? Please excuse me if it's a stupid question, I've only started with Python. I'm specialized in C++ where it would be easy to achieve...
Can IT install docker server on the client machines? This way you could use or create docker containers with whatever Python and packages you want, safely, without asking for permission.
Isn't that what Jupyter notebooks are for?
Well, it would be the best if the class I'm looking for would be implemented in C / C++ and providing a Python interface, just like NumPy package. 
That's a bit like replacing a Ford Pinto with a Humvee for grocery shopping.
list comprehension is very much used, regex a bit less so. lambda functions i use when i need to use them - for example - when passing a user defined function as a callback for some button press in tkinter. 
Thank you this is helpful.
Yes. Thanks. A colleague has also suggested codeacademy so gonna check it out. I wanted to know more if and how coding might help me in my career but I guess I'll ask around.
Yes agreed that if I learn something, not applying in my day to day job may make me forget what I learned. Which is why I wanted to know what kind of jobs might be out there for someone like me. I'll check codeacademy for sure. Thanks again.
Thanks, will do.
Okay, noted. And yes I'm gonna do a little bit of reading before diving into somethi.g 
This is great. You could add some pandas stuff in there which is pretty good. Also reading writing to google sheets would be a nice add.

In the JSON example, I prefer to use *indent* for the output... json.dump(list,d,indent=4) The result then looks this this: [ "foo", { "bar": [ "baz", null, 1.0, 2 ] } ] This is much easier for me to read when the JSON structure is large. _____ You can also achieve the same effect like this: echo '["foo", {"bar": ["baz", null, 1.0, 2]}]' | python3 -m json.tool

* Generally speaking, don't use pickle. It's only suitable for *trusted* data exchange, and even then not necessarily better/faster than more trustworthy exchange formats.

Also [lzma](https://docs.python.org/3/library/lzma.html) is strictly better than bzip2 in almost every case, it compresses better, decompresses much faster (constant) and compresses faster at equivalent-or-better compression ratios (but not setting). The only reasons to use bzip2 are backwards compatibility and memory constraints (at high levels, LZMA uses more RAM for decompression and outright lots of RAM for compression). * minidom is a crummy API, prefer [ElementTree](https://docs.python.org/3/library/xml.etree.elementtree.html). This also provides an easier step to [lxml](http://lxml.de). * it's nice that they mentioned fileinput (too often forgotten), odd that they forgot [glob](https://docs.python.org/3/library/glob.html), and [pathlib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html), though I guess these deal with FS paths rather than file content? * argparse has [built-in support for file arguments](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html?filetype-objects). * [shutil](https://docs.python.org/3/library/shutil.html) is hardly perfect, but provides many useful functions to manipulate both path-indexed files and the broader category of "file objects", this includes [high-level archival routines](https://docs.python.org/3/library/shutil.html?highlight=shutil#archiving-operations) so you don't have to muck around with zipfile/tarfile if you don't need custom processing or whatnot. * [sqlite3](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html) has been bundled for years.
both scipy and numpy have now wheels for windows starting from version 1.0 and hopefully it is not a problem anymore. 
I have been using Python on Windows for about 4 years and all I did was install Python, Cython and `pip`. The rest is basically a lot of `pip install ...`. I didn't have any issues so far. After NumPy 1.14 and SciPy 1.0 I'm building these packages on Windows against OpenBLAS to use the newest features. I am not even using virtual environments. Apart from some dusty corners, I have to say I'm really satisfied with the simplicity and zero-hassle.
Very promosing! I will look into it! Thank you
Woah, these are long functions. Ever heard of S in SOLID?
I build and sell bots if you need me.
I'm doing this with [yagmail](https://github.com/kootenpv/yagmail) (I'm the creator), should really suit your case (html email, adding attachments, template). I just have a file like msg.txt containing Dear {}, Attached a pdf Bye then ```python yag = yagmail.SMTP() yag.send(to="email", contents=msg.txt, subject="subject {}".format(1), attachments=["file.pdf"]) ```
I automated adding content to a wordpress site. I had to scrape data that was displayed in a div and generated by a javascript function...so that was a little bit of a nuisance. I ended up rewriting the javascript function. :)
Lots of OS Stuff, web scraping, office tools, I even used python to help automate the process of writing c code for an Arduino robot via a tkinter GUI to control the servos directly( to design the movement) then used the recorded move data to build he movements as c functions.
&gt; argparse has built-in support for file arguments. While I know it'll be fine, I always feel dirty doing this because it won't be in a context-manager. What I tend to do is `type=pathlib.Path`.
Mabe it would be better if it could also scan the RSS feed. Not sure if it possible
&gt; What I tend to do is type=pathlib.Path. That only provides some convenience for opening the file though, `FileType`'s advantages are that it handles `-` (as stdin or stdout depending on the FileType's mode) and validates that the path exists otherwise.
I used to struggle with a similar mess in the past, and mainly this was the result from me being somewhat undisciplined (too put not too fine a point on it ;^) Two years ago I also took the opportunity of laptop replacement to try to set-up something that would help me to keep myself in line... And mostly it has worked... I went for the following set-up - A bare-necessities system-wide python install - A set of virtual environments for specific projects - A set of project folders, containing project code (and data files) under git control For the system-wide python I used the Miniconda install as starting point. I then added the Anaconda Navigator to it, and using the Navigator I installed Jupyter in it. This gives me a nice starting point which is also easy to upgrade without having to worry too much about possible side-effects to projects etc... I am working on. The virtual environments are decked out with different combinations of python versions and libraries, more or less grouped according to project types. This gives me a number of 'standard' environments, again relatively easy to upgrade/extend when and as needed. For this I typically clone the virtual environment, deploy the upgrade/additions in the clone, test the clone with the projects which are based on the original environment. And if that works out well, I switch over the projects to the clone and archive the original (you never know, sometimes you only find out after a while something in a project is no longer working as it should...). In a sense, these virtual environments also provide me with 'templates' for creating new environments that are slightly different. Again, simply clone an environment closest to the new needed set-up and then install the additional stuff into the clone. As said, project code (and data files) live outside of the virtual environments in a separate folder structure. Each project is under git control (even when they are essentially nothing more than a bunch of notebooks), enabling me to easily project code roll-back as and when needed. So far it above works for me. Mentally I sometimes still 'resist' the discipline it enforces on me, but then I think back to my previous mess and well...

Which version of python are you using 2.7.x ? 
Simple syntax error, you didnt close the parenthese
You didn’t ask about it, but if you like list comprehensions, also take a look at generator expressions. Same syntax except with parentheses over brackets. It does the same thing but lazily (and is exhaustible so not as good if you reuse the results) You can use them to create a chain of operations and can nest functions. Also, they are implicit when already in parentheses For example (I’m on my phone so this may have a typo mylist = list(range(100)) The following will loop through the *entire* list first: any([ii&gt;5 for ii in mylist]) While the following will break sooner any(ii&gt;5 for ii in mylist) Where, in this case, you don’t need an inner parentheses 
Generally the community of people here is more receptive to _specific questions_. Meaning you should share where you started/what you have tried? Show some code and where you’re stuck. Also in the future /r/learnpython is where you should ask for help (/r/python is meant more for news and such).
In terms of navigation, the direction to the nearest food source is calculated using basic geometry. This direction value is then used as an input for the NN which decides how to act on this information (which direction to change). The NN does not determine the closest food source.

2.7
I'm actually working on a deep reinforcement version of this using tensorflow for that exact purpose!
Personally, I use anaconda on my Mac with a default 2.7 install and then I have a full anaconda 3.6 conda environment (I write all code for both). Then, for most things, if it is pure python, I use virtualenv since I prefer the local approach of where it puts things. Generally, if I am doing something with SciPy, etc I don’t isolate the environment but if I did need to, I would use conda. Not 100% sure it is cleaner but it isn’t too bad. I haven’t benchmarked it on my (fast) work Mac but on my aging home laptop, I do notice system python is slightly faster than anaconda. Probably compared with optimization. 
From a pedagogical approach, I am sure this was a fun exercise and that is of great value. But from a practical view, this single function calculator would be much better done in a spreadsheet. 
Oh, FileType handles stdin/stdout? Nice! The validation I don't care as much about but then in my scripts, its been acceptable to report errors by just having python throw on `path.read_text()`.
I made a bot that automatically creates a spotify playlist from a list new EDM songs coming out every week.
I don't see IBM's INFORMIX listed as an SQL choice. http://www.ciscounitytools.com/Applications/CxN/InformixODBC/InformixODBC.html
The issue is probably that on line 11 you open a parenthesis that is not closed afterwards (guess you need another closing parenthesis on line 12) Gentle suggestion for the future for these type of questions =&gt; post in /r/rlearnpython ;) 
Can I use CPython and use this wrapper instead? http://www.ciscounitytools.com/CodeSamples/Connection/ODBC/ODBC.html I think I am stuck using .NET libraries?
Pathlib is worth a mention - and its backport for python2, pathlib2. The only issue with pathlib2 is that a lot of python2 libraries (including `os.path`) don't like Path objects.
It looks like you are putting your headers in the same dictionary as your POST data and then passing it all to the `data` parameter. That's not where you should put headers. 403 error suggests that you are not authorized, likely due to a bad login, limit reached, banned, etc. In requests, you can pass in your headers, too. You can say like: `requests.post(url = API_ENDPOINT, headers=headers, data=data)` According to those API docs, you should only be putting `identifier` and `password` in the body of your request. Also, [here](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/user/quickstart/#custom-headers) is the documentation for requests which has some examples for settings headers and bodys. Also, make sure you encode your data dictionary to JSON.
Very cool. Thanks for including the code. I was expecting to see Bokeh but see Seaborn instead (but mostly didn't realize that matplotlib has an animation feature!). Since I also use Quandl, I have to rewrite this and pull in something else ... maybe something that would shift over time, like AMD. (I currently have a program that shows how volatility shifts over time (5 years) but it uses multiple graphs). If it shows up in a lecture I will make sure to give you credit,
I had this exact same idea, but you got there first! I've thought of some cool ways to extend this though, which I'll try to implement.
Four spaces in front of each line to format code for reddit.
Ok will do. Thanks 👌
Thank you ProfEpsilon ! Quandl is a really fantastic source of data - I only the free plan and even though lots of useful and reliable information available. I do something with Bokeh, they are in the top menu (Bitcoin, Solar Activity, etc), in separated pages. Sometimes the Bokeh's html code gets heavier and if I put them on a normal post they "overcharge" the blog and the Blogger truncates the page. Regards. Roberval

I have always liked configobj better, but it hasn't been updated in a while - https://pypi.python.org/pypi/configobj/5.0.6
I had an issue with ElementTree that I never figured out. The function was building XML, and when ran in the console or as a script directly it worked just fine. But when imported the xml output was always empty. I logged the crap out of it. Couldn't find any kind of difference in input from when called directly vs when called from a module. Replacing the element tree with just text concatenation worked though, soo...

No path.py... It makes managing files and folders so easy. 
Deployment. Fabric FTW.
&gt; consider tarfile I really don't understand why anyone is still using the tar format.
[Redacted]
My job.
 Exactly, that's the most important one.
What is actually the difference between the two versions?
Ah I see, I admit I skim read the approach and jumped to a few conclusions. Very cool my man
I hate xml!
Do you happen to have a github repo? This sounds cool! Did you use a spotify API or something? 
What kind of deployment were you doing? 
I agree completely, this was more of a proof of concept than anything else. 
You've got a lot of duplicated logic. Make one generic function that parses a number in any base, and one generic function that prints the number in the right base.

After auditing a (giant) code base using Fortify AuditWorkbench we have some python that calls the Fortify report generator for PDF and XML, with a custom xml template, then extracts info from the XML report and uses it to generate an excel file formatted to the customer expectations.
/r/learnpython wiki has a lot of them.
No, i don't have one yet, since it's my first "real" project, but soon I'll publish the code. If you are interested, its name is /u/EdmMusicBot. I probably screwed up while making the Spotify account, so it has a really strange username. Just check out the Reddit user's post. Yes, I used Spotify APIs with the python wrapper. It's pretty easy to use, once you understand how it works.
I’m in the first stage of a project for finding the best time to leave for work. I have flexibility on when I show up. Currently every 5 minutes I get google maps directions data from their API for to and from work. Once I have a ton of data, I’ll have to figure out how to get information out of the data. 
Thank you!! I got that not long after. 
To parse arguments use [**argparse**](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/argparse.html) module. And I don't see any special python3 logic, let people choose what version of python they can use. I mean replace python3 to python
You can use the `json` module in the standard library, or, if you're using `requests`, just call `.json()` on the response.
What's your job?
Didn't know that existed. Thanks! 
Thank you!
Tried that, Cannot get it at all! 
What do you mean "cannot get it"? What have you tried? Are you getting an error message?
No errors or anything, I just need to print out all the Deal ID's in that request. I can see the data coming back just cannot figure out how to get the DealID's in a list. 
Well, it gives you a list of dicts. You can loop over that list of dicts using a `for` loop, and then print out each `dealId` field.
Yeah I'm not sure how to do that either. Sorry... Any chance you could give me an example.
 for position in your_response_data['positions']: print(position['position']['dealId'])
&gt; for position in your_response_data['positions']: print(position['position']['dealId']) That's amazing, Thanks!! Worked first time. 
Do you understand _how_ it works?
Sort of, Not entirely sure but I get the idea. 
What do you mean by "corrupt"? Do you want to make the file unplayable? Replace the sound with noise? Decrease the sound quality, but keep it recognizable?
Which part do you not understand?
I want it unplayable. Thanks for any help!
Then just overwrite the file with random noise.
I may be incorrect, but couldn't you just open the file in read bytes mode, strip some characters from the start, middle or end and then re-save it to the file? I'm reasonably sure this should stop it from being able to be decoded.
I'll take a stab at it man, thanks!
Practice More!
Practice More!
Practice More!
Actually, it doesn't even have to be noise. You can just write an empty file, or a file of all zeroes, and it will be unplayable as audio for obvious reasons.
...what.
Practice More!

If there's some compelling reason to not use a module like `ppb_vector`, mentioned in another response, you *could* subclass namedtuple and add those methods. (I think there'd need to be a really compelling reason to do this, though. Re-implementing math operations that someone else has already spent time optimizing and debugging is.... let's call it inefficient.)
This is the question I'm most interested in. Couldn't you just subclass `numpy.ndarray` and use the `@property` decorator?
It's probably fine for that use case, your trained model files are local and thus likely trusted. You could also save them to a DB (e.g. sqlite3 for instance since that's builtin) or to json (you can have custom serialisers and deserialisers), that would give you interop if that's every useful, but that doesn't really seem worth the hassle here.

It's POSIX and for most use cases not significantly worse than zip, which has incidentally been legally problematic in the past (a public domain dedication has *no effect whatsoever* in most of the world). 7z seems to have very few implementations and is a rather complex format, I haven't even heard of dar or zpaq before writing this comment (but zpaq looks cool), rar is obviously proprietary. So yeah, people still use tar because it's generally good enough for their needs.
&gt; Oh, FileType handles stdin/stdout? Nice! Yup, it's really neat when you find out (and happen to have a use for it): &gt; FileType objects understand the pseudo-argument '-' and automatically convert this into `sys.stdin` for readable FileType objects and `sys.stdout` for writable FileType objects &gt; The validation I don't care as much about but then in my scripts, its been acceptable to report errors by just having python throw on path.read_text(). Fair enough. 
Good article, but honestly I would drop the "deep learning" part from your title. I think it's misleading, as what you programmed isn't representative of modern deep learning. Not a good idea to mislead newbies, who are your target audience.
for node in d['markets']: print(node['markets']['name']) That's it. 
Where does `d` come from?
d is my returned value. 
Once a week it checks my account to see if there were any cash deposits made recently. It then decides how to allocate the cash to the proper fund, stock etc. Once it figures out that it will initiate the order for the stock, or etf. Honestly I used it more as a learning project. 
I love all of the topics covered in this book. I'm still a little unclear on what the finished app actually does. Is there a link to a demo of the finished product?
Returned value of _what_? Post the entire program, please, all of it.
for position in your_response_data['positions']: print(position['position']['dealId']) d is my your_response_data
Post the entire program. From the start, to the end. So I can run it on my computer. Not just this bit, the whole thing, the entire file you have open in your editor.

Sure it is. What do you think deep learning is? Just matrix multiplication and activation functions, at its core.
The compression isn't worse than zip, but the **access time** is horrible, because the entire archive has to be decoded to read a single file. I want to throttle my colleagues that tar.gzip large sets of data.
FOR FUCKS SAKES WHY?
deep learning primarily refers to the use of local receptive fields, aka convolutional layers, among other layers in recent years. I would not classify a simple fully connected ANN as deep learning unless it had over a couple million parameters. 
I'm new to python, learning it for my lab. I wrote a program that creates peptide sequences for our robot, and I have a gui generated using wxGlade, but I can't figure out how to "put" my program into the gui!
Interesting script. I will play around with a bit (later today) and give you feedback. 
Thank for sharing!
The only difference between deep and shallow neural networks is the number of hidden layers, according to Andrew Ng. It doesn't have to be convolutional, recurrent, or even have tons of nodes in each layer. So, you're right that his model isn't deep. But the reason it's not deep is it only has one hidden layer, not that he's doing matrix operations.

An audio file typically starts with a header that describes the audio. If you corrupt that, the file will be corrupt. And any sensible audio player will see it as corrupt. If you just change random bytes in the audio data it will not corrupt the file. Just change the sound to noise those places.

Question better suited for /r/learnpython You import `random` twice; one import is enough. Depending on how your word list is structured, if all words are separated by a newline you can use the `.readlines()` method instead of `.read()` to instantly get a list. And speaking of files, you should use `with` to open your file; with open('words_list.txt') as f: words = f.read().split() # or f.readlines(), if that works for you word = random.choice(words) That example also fixes your code a bit; yours doesn't actually choose a random word, it seems to choose a random character. Plus, your variable names were confusing. Don't take my criticism as if I'm offending you; nobody is expected to be perfect the first time they do something, such as writing a small game. I'm just trying to give you the information I wish I'd had when I started. :p 
Is there anyway to make this work in python3 ?

Right, but you're after a 6 line class. It's something like the following. I've never subclassed array, so test it. class XYPoints(np.ndarray): def __init__(self, xypoints): xypoints = np.asarray(xypoints) np.ndarray.__init__(xypoints) self.x = xypoints[:, 0] self.y = xypoints[:, 1]

just saw your post, apology, heading there now, thanks 
&gt; The compression isn't worse than zip One would expect the opposite considering zip contents are compressed file-per-file and the metadata is in cleartext, whereas a compressed tar will compress the entire thing as a single stream, allowing cross-file sharing. That is, in fact, the result I get (at least for "source" tarballs like babel or sphinx), the tar.gz archive is consistently smaller than the zip one, not to mention the tar.xz one which puts both to shame. And IIRC you can use "block-encoded" xz which allow efficient random access of the raw bitstream, which could allow relatively efficient[0] random access to an xz-aware tar client. &gt; but the access time is horrible, because the entire archive has to be decoded to read a single file. Operative words: **for most use cases**. Are there cases where you need access to the decompressed data of one specific file out of the archive and that only? Sure, but I think I've needed that about twice in the last decade. The common use case of tarballs is to just ship a bunch of files together and unpack them all at the destination (or keep them compressed). So once again, for most use cases, tar is not significantly worse than zip. &gt; I want to throttle my colleagues that tar.gzip large sets of data. Complain to your colleagues that tar is a bad format for your use case, but that's a minority use case nonetheless. [0] because tar does not have a central directory, you still have to read each header and seek over/ahead of any file you don't care for
 some people can't be helped
Super slow when you try to load 50'000 rows compared to a straight python client library request
I considered mentioning that but the post seems to deal with file *contents* rather than *paths*. pathlib, as its name denotes, deals with paths rather than files.
&gt; Operative words: for most use cases. I think you're getting this wrong actually - your case, where you seem to be using the tar format as-intended, is the **minority**. A huge number of software engineers have just always seen 'tar.gz' on their systems or on stackoverflow, and assume that it's some sort of "mega compression".

Before going on vacation in August, I wanted to get three day camping reservations at Yosemite. Everything was booked but I read that sometimes people cancel their reservations and to keep checking for these cancellations. Well, I could hardly call myself an engineer if I'd spend all day manually refreshing and checking the reservations page. So I built a Selenium app that did that for me, set it up so that it was running headless on the RaspberryPI using pyvirtualdisplay, ran the application and in a few days, I got my reservations. Best vacation so far and I get bragging rights for getting us the reservations.
