Thanks a lot this was really helpful 
I'd probably just implement something like this manually, have a function that uses methods / built in functions to check type (could also to convert and use error handling). Then return the type (as a string?) And then use some logic to convert the data or build or SQL statements.
Actually, there's like over a hundred open source libraries on Zerynth [Github](https://github.com/zerynth).

Based on your described use case you're probably right to go with `pipenv`. Basically as you'll read in the top reply post on that Reddit thread (the one from Thea at PyPA) the use case for pipenv is rather narrowly constrained to production applications that have grown sufficiently that they really need solid dependency pinning and determinism, and what you describe as your needs seem to fit well within that scope. It's the first tool to leverage **PipFile** and **PipFile.lock** to that end -- both of which are specifications that were [promulgated by the PyPA](https://github.com/pypa/pipfile) specifically to address aspects very much lacking from requirements.txt -- and it's probably not the last, as the odds are those specifications will endure, even if pipenv itself falls by the wayside. Which is unlikely, since it's now a PyPA project. Unlike with `poetry` -- which seems a very good project but one that in contrast to pipenv is narrowly aimed at _library_ development -- I haven't come across any way in which `pipenv` inserts itself into the standards its chosen to ride upon, so vendor lock-in doesn't seem to be an issue. That said I'm not dissing poetry for that choice (in a lot of ways the **pyproject.toml** standard encourages it), and there's nothing inherently wrong with locking in, just saying that should better things come down the line for **PipFile** and **PipFile.lock** there shouldn't be too much difficulty transitioning. Basically I've been looking at a similar set of problems... odds are I'd use poetry for libraries that my application is going to use and pipenv for the application that uses those libraries. The poetry approach to managing the problems of getting things into PyPi seems pretty smooth and smart, but it doesn't address the dependency locking and determinism that's important to the last mile... nothing wrong with using different tools for different tasks.
Please install Python 3
im skeptical of any framework whose mobile site doesn't fit on the screen
Use a [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) DataFrame. pandas can detect/cast data types of columns, create new columns with an applied function, describe the shape of data (min, max, mean, percentiles, etc.). pandas is designed for efficient tabular-data processing, and is the de-facto toolkit for data analysis in Python.
unless I'm mistaken, I think OP already use pandas. If the data is too large for pandas (remember, pandas is very inefficient with large enough data), he could try pyspark, although I'm not sure it would actually be better with a single laptop. 
Things that worked for me: 1)Think of a simple project and finish it. Try to understand everything you're doing and if you don't, research about every piece of code you want to understand better. 2) Take someone's code as an example and change it with your own ideas. Just for your own, of course. Think of something you would add or change and how could it work with the rest of the code. 3) Read someone's code and try to understand how it works. Just spend 1 hour trying to understand it, researching about it on google or python books. Again, this worked for me, I'm not saying this is the only way to understand code, nor the best. But it's the way I did.
Thanks for taking the time to reply. I'm afraid I fall into that target audience, but that doesn't really explain why it's not more broadly used. What is it missing to compete with pipenv or the other solutions?
I don't know what's that
It's Twitter's real time API
First of all I am not using molten, but flask. When visiting the flask documentation for the first time I was like: oh my good what an ugly page. So maybe we should give molten a change :P
Maybe you should have a look at the Click python module for your project. 
It's funny that the first thing mentioned is sentiment analysis when machine learning is terrible at it. It's good for whatever data set you train it on, but they often will fail pretty quickly once you use that on something other than outside that specific domain. I recall reading a paper that looked specifically at a sentiment analysis ML that was trained on movie reviews (it was a popular data set for doing sentiment analysis). It failed at looking at anything outside that. So, you wouldn't be able to apply that to say, Twitter.
Any GUI library will do. I would go with enaml or qt for python. 
Long time ago I read a book (sorry, don't remember the title or the name of the author), where people used human brains instead of CPUs. Programming was replaced with teaching and showing special images to connected sensors... Yea, that ain't happening anytime soon. Continue your journey with Python and try also other languages later on. I recommend C to get a grasp of low level programming, which helps lots with understanding why some things work the way they work in higher level languages. 
finishing up one of the first undetectable, online ps4/xbox hacks. Going to make a in-depth post about it later, not sure which subreddit it should go in tho :/? 
You could stream the audio output over the network. Unfortunately, I know nothing about MacOSX and iOS audio subsystems, but I have used something like that on Linux between two computers and it worked fine. If you want to listen to music only and you don't care about audio from a web browser for example, it will be much simpler to do, because you don't have to tap into the system audio output. Just implement a live HLS server by splitting audio data from files into chunks, building MP3U8 playlist and serving everything via HTTP(S). It's a really simple protocol, created by Apple. 
Frontend problem not a backend one.
Pandas can do a lot of stuff for you, including writing back to the database. If you want to do ETL that takes flat file data (like CSV) and process it, then compare records to the ones in the database, that's pretty straightforward. Pandas is a `read_sql` method to query from a database into a dataframe, and a `to_sql` method to put a dataframe into a table (including append to the end). If you have table constraints in place in the database, this can make it easy to add new data without worrying about overwriting or duplicating records. If you want to do something now complex like an "upsert", which is essentially an update if exists or insert if not, then python control statements make that much easier than SQL. Lastly, if you start going down this route,I highly recommend having a dev environment to try things out in without breaking your production database (assuming it's used for reporting, not for financial transactions as then you shouldn't be doing any of this there). 
Learn about all the cool stuff you can make first, poke around and find out what interests you most, computer vision? machine learning? web scraping? etc. iv met quite a few people that thought they would enjoy coding, then realize they actually hate it lol, so make sure you fully understand what programming is and whether or not you'll enjoy it. Don't go in blind and start learning random stuff, come up with an idea/project to work through as you go. There's a lot of misconceptions about programming and how it works/what you do, to many people end up wasting a large amount of time and resources enrolling in programming courses, just to find out it's not what they thought. Before learning python, make sure you understand basic computer stuff, like whats inside etc Avoid premature optimization!
I am almost exclusively using [io.StringIO](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/io.html#io.StringIO) for the initial walk and munging the integer NULLs (for the same reasons) in general because int8 and a float64 makes a lot of difference in the resulting dataframe size (my data is relatively small though \~10M lines of CSV). &amp;#x200B; It is pretty quick and plugging in a bit of regex does the job pretty well. You can instead just read the file line-by-line and keep the record of things. That can be automated pretty quickly.
 Hey! I would be down to do this with you! iv been thinking about doing 24-48 hour programming live streams where people can ask questions and get help, yenno, work through problems together, hmu if your interested! &amp;#x200B; (currently focused on python, opencv, machine learning)
Just when I thought it’s possible to have a reasonable discussion on reddit without personal attacks. 🤦🏻‍♂️
Poetry’s UX is very intuitive. This project deserves so much more attention than what it’s currently getting.
This seems like it might be it: [https://spiral.imperial.ac.uk/bitstream/10044/1/53122/2/brexit\_twitterpolling.pdf](https://spiral.imperial.ac.uk/bitstream/10044/1/53122/2/brexit_twitterpolling.pdf) I've only briefly read it, so let me know if I'm completely wrong! 
this is really cool. no idea it was even possible in python. will probably use this at some point. thanks! ps just skimming it seems to me you could (if you wanted to!) write something that uses argparse's configuration. that would then be a library that could be "dropped in" to many, many python programs...
Since there are like 2 billion python web frameworks I would imagine the normal state is under appreciated.
because jupyter has a well-specced way to talk with arbitrary language kernels. if you need to send code somewhere and get visualizations (text, graphics) back, this is very useful.
I think this is a very practical way to manage a library that needs a synchronous and asynchronous interface without magic, such as what tools like \[unasync\]([https://github.com/python-trio/unasync](https://github.com/python-trio/unasync)) do.
Programs to test UIs already exists. What exactly would be the goal of such an AI?
Is there anything that missing from all other python frameworks? Or it is a “just for fun” project?
ok thnx
I don't see a reason to use this over already existing frameworks. also, the way routes work seems very verbose
I was curious why you think that so I measured it: $ time python -c "pass" real 0m0.309s user 0m0.028s sys 0m0.019s $ time python -c "pass" real 0m0.046s user 0m0.030s sys 0m0.012s So 300ms from cold start, 30ms once my system has cached python. For comparison bash takes 8ms. So yeah it's slower but I wouldn't notice it.

I, too, go out of my way to voice my displeasures with things I’m not forced to use. Stay strong, friend. 
&gt;https://github.com/freakH2O/InstagramMassUnfollow Hey nice job! But why would you simulate mouse click instead of using selenium methods as [element.click](https://element.click)() ?
Hm, nice. Motivation is clear. Feels like you try to bring some Java-like experience into the python world. Dependency injection, strict typing ... But again it is a matter of taste.
Why I like Python * It's dynamically typed * No curly braces (life is better without braces) * feels like pseudocode * like the use of "\_" (good practice * Interpreted and fast enough And last but not least * I don't like snakes &amp;#x200B;
This is a front-end problem nothing to do with the framework, but yeah, they could fix that to give a better impression.
Or even better, use f-strings
I don't see where's the problem with that. I love Flask's documentation, it's simple, easy to read and very light (work in any device, even my old 6 years old mobile) and most importantly gets the job done.
In many cases you can significantly improve the performance of algorithms by using the appropriate data structures. I.e. the use of a well-written heap class is essential to ensure O(V*logV+E) in finding shortest paths in a graph. These are obviously better if packaged in classes. A solid knowledge of OO is also useful if you need to modify existing libraries for specific uses. I.e. apply a decorator pattern to extend functionality of a class instead of having to inherit and override.
I recently checked out this website. It seems quite attractive and the content too is quite well written. But I am quite confused about the product that is been offered. What is the product that this site offers?
* Not sure what you mean with too dynamically typed. * I like\_underscores and how\_they are used, I tend to find it readable. * No curly braces are the opposite of your previous comment about too many underscores. Again I find it more readable. * If you write pseudocode like python, no curly braces and so on, then I would argue that maybe the problem is not that python feels like pseudocode but that you naturally write python when you do not have to think about bookkeeping-syntax. * there are multiple design choices that can be argued when it comes to naming. like \`for\` should be called \`foreach\`, guess it is just too late to change it now. * You are allowed to dislike interpreted languages, not sure that calling it slow is a language feature you can use. * Python is not named after a snake, but rather a something funny from Great Brittain. 
Sometimea the driver cant correctlt focus the elements so to avoid any errora at all i used py auto gui its very brittle i know but hey it works 👌👌😁
Play stupid games. Win stupid prizes.
semantics. my point was that the tool abstracts away the use of virtual environments entirely, in a way easily works across individuals' machines. At work, all our tooling just assumes you're already in the correct virtualenv because there were too many issues and inconsistencies across environments. This would all disappear if it was simply a matter of `poetry run bin/foo`
&gt; It's too dynamically typed There is dynamically typed or there's statically typed... if you want to believe that _any_ dynamic typing is too much, that's fine, but you've got issues with a lot more languages than Python. &gt; Too_many_underscores They're not exactly a defining feature or the language, just use **dromedaryCase** ... your code will be sinfully ugly, but that's fine if you're the only one who sees it. &gt; No curly braces. I have to rely on empty areas to discern logic Sure, and it's easy... is it indented more than the previous line? New scope. Same indent? Same scope. Less indent? Just exited the above scope. Simples. &gt; Feels like pseudocode Good. If machines could perfectly understand pseudocode then most people could code. This isn't a bad thing. &gt; __init__ is the constructor? Why not just call it constructor No, it's not. The constrictor is actually the combination of `Thing.__new__` and `Thing.__init__`... but once those methods exist the constructor is actually just `Thing()`... you'd have us call `Thing.new().constructor()`? &gt; Interpreted and slow Ok, so you like compiled and fast... why are you expressing a negative opinion about something you aren't inclined to use anyway? &gt; I don't like snakes, so_I_don't_like_python (jk) Not named for the snake. &gt; EDIT: You could explain why you think otherwise instead of the downvotes. These aren't mutually exclusive.
Honestly everything I want in a framework. We've built up a sort-of half-ass implementation of many of the design goals of this project (on top of flask) as the need became clear. As much as I'd personally love to switch, the flask momentum is too big for now
ugly is a matter of taste. not fitting the screen is about functionality

Here is a complete approach to land a data science job- * Learn the requisite skills and technologies in Data Science * Work on a variety of projects * And finally, you would be fit to land a job Although data science is a great career and you would have many opportunities however, let me tell you , Getting a job would not be easy. So in order to become a data scientist, learn- * **Statistics**—This is the backbone of Data Science. Skills in Statistics would be useful for **analyzing** the available data. You are required to have a thorough understanding of various **statistical techniques.** * **R and Python programming—**An understanding of R and Python is required for *data collection and cleaning.* Plus, you would be implementing the variety of **data analysis** techniques using programming skills. * **Predictive analysis—** In Predictive analysis, you would be using statistics to either estimate the behavior that a customer is likely to exhibit or to **forecast the future** outcomes of the business. * **Machine learning algorithms—** With skills in Machine learning, you would be performing data analysis that automates **analytical model building.** For this, you need to have an understanding of machine learning algorithms and their usage. **kNN**, **Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree,** etc are some algorithms that you should know as a beginner. * **Visualization tools—** For having a clear insight into the numbers of the business, you need to have an understanding of visualizations tools. **Tableau, QlikView, Plotly** are some commonly used tools that you need to know. * **Predictive modelling—** Herein you are required to understand an extensive set of machine learning algorithms using which you would be building predictive **models.** After learning all of these, switch to projects! Build a portfolio and you would get a Data Science job. Hope this helps!

so, what's your favorite language then?
Sorry about the error omission: xml.etree.ElementTree.ParseError: not well-formed (invalid token): line 2, column 2488186 If I change the xED or other such characters to i or regular character the parse completes fine.

No idea about raspberry but I’d choose pyside2 and then make a .exe with pyinstaller
You abstract away a physical path by replacing it with a environment name that also map a physical path. Semantics indeed...
Nice. Now run the actual script.
Omg I didn't think about that
\_\_init\_\_ is the initializer. Apart from that, we're all consenting adults, so if you dislike the language, just don't use it. 
Take a look at [PySimpleGUI](http://www.PySimpleGUI.org). It's easy to work with, has ample documentation, and you can use the Cookbook to be up and running in 5 minutes. It will support touch screens with no problem. I was using it with a laptop touchscreen. It works with tkinter which is pretty solid. It's possible to make tkinter look pretty good by simply supplying your own button artwork and using good UI designs. This [weather application](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13696193/47305323-1d4ca200-d5f7-11e8-8fb1-44b0a7a4580f.jpg) is running on my Pi and stays up for days. The [source code](https://github.com/MikeTheWatchGuy/PySimpleGUI/blob/master/DemoPrograms/Demo_LED_Clock_Weather.py) is quite short. You can develop and run everything on your PC or Linux machine with either port and then run on your Pi when you're done. It also has a version that works with Qt in case you want a more modern looking GUI. I don't think they look all that different to be honest. You can even start on tkinter and move to Qt by simply changing the import statement. The Qt version uses PySide2. Unclear if it'll work on a Pi.
Would you recommend the book? I like this - working on your skills. Sounds like a great project!
What's this?
Name me a programming language you like, I'll generate the same kind of list
If it's a dll, do you even know if you can make it work on Linux? Especially it it's a driver thing, drivers in linux and windows are pretty different
I bet it's java.
Yo hago eso dependiendo quien va a colaborar en el proyecto. Por ejemplo, con el software que hice sabia que iba destinado solo a Argentina (por el tipo de calculos que hace), por eso decidí hacerlo en español porque tenia que ser visto por gente que quizás no maneje el inglés en su vida cotidiana, especialmente ingenieros civiles.
O podría ser "yo". Igualmente me gusta mantener ciertas convenciones.
No estaría mal jajaja
This is just about startup time not python performance vs bash
for example individuals can [configure](https://poetry.eustace.io/docs/configuration/) poetry to work however they like re the placement and mechanism of venvs, and the tool will handle it. as I said, assuming paths and trying to write tooling which works according to everyone's setup was fraught and always broke, so we stopped doing it. a net loss in usability without a tool to fill that gap 
Bonobo ETL is made for this and looks pretty intuitive, but I only played with it for half an hour. ruffus is another such library designed by a genetics research group, and recently someone started maintaining after several years' hiatus. I've found it fairly reliable, but the code is now really "old style Python".
Also, * The underscores are really practical and useful in Linux based systems for naming directories and files, so it's good to get used to it. * Without the curly braces the code looks cleaner. * Python isn't that slow, in most of the projects you won't even notice that much difference between Python and C.
Yes, collection of figlet fonts + 1-line arts ;-)
Thanks ;-)
Sure but I didn’t want to make it too complicated seeing the nature of the answer.
Did you try it? The majority of Python startup time is spent in the number of stat() calls needed during import.
After you learn programming you will be able to actually use a computer the way it was meant to be used. You will be able to create tools to make your tasks faster and easier. You will be able to think and solve problems better, even without a computer. So even if don't get a job, it's not a waste of time.
Oh no, I didn't take it that way at all. Some of us need a good reminder now and then. I wish I'd heard that sentiment more often years ago. 
Apply for jobs. Simple as that. Its not your role in this exercise to make the hiring managers mind up for them. They are the ones to figure out if they want someone with your level of experience or not. Put projects from your github on to your CV. List out each one as if it were a project given to you by an employer. Put the links to the repo. I read a lot of posts here from people who are probably competent, but not confident. You won't know you're good enough until you apply. Sure you might not even get an interview, but try and get feedback and then iterate.
Build something thats presentable. And when they ask for your credentials, show them your actual projects. Sure, you will bump into many close-minded people, but you have to break through it and keep trying over and over again. You will find that there are actually many people, who will find your self taught journey, attractive. As long as, you have results.
Thanks, that was the terminology I was looking for. I was able to also find this talk which explained things a bit more for me. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ByQhAM5c1I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ByQhAM5c1I)
&gt; But alot of positions which are open seems to require some experience or a degree. I know, sadly this is a problem in any area of expertise. You could start looking in this sub [Job Board](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/9o5w2z/rpython_official_job_board/), but it's easier to look for something in your town first, I find that talking person to person is easier to get a job, because you can demonstrate you experience and confidence better. &amp;#x200B;
Or PyQt and fbs: https://build-system.fman.io/
What is the point of this article?
I m not programmer but into cybersec stuff. So my opinion may not reflect reality. But if you are fiddling for 7 years with python, it should not be an issue to land an entry position in a python job. We met guys who are DevOps and have less than 2 year of python experience...They are proficient in ruby and other linux stuff too. Also moee and more remote position, especially if you are a programmer. Everything is going to the cloud, companies are pushing employee to telework via vpn.... make some saving in utilities for them. just apply for positions. good luck. 
I'm a senior data analyst that use Python for data analysis and automation. I don't create classes, but then again, I don't write code for others. So you may be interested in this [tutorial](https://changhsinlee.com/pyderpuffgirls-ep1/) tailored for data analysts.

Is anyone actively using this? Would like to know the pros and cons. I currently use falcon which is very lightweight. Having a framework which includes validation and DI seems pretty valuable.
&gt;also, the way routes work seems very verbose Do you mean the implementation of request routing in this framework is too verbose? That's an odd complaint. Why would you care as long as it's performing well and is easy to use.
Wow, I didn't know about fbs. That goes straight to my bookmarks. Thank you.
No suelo leer casi nada en español, sorry.
Ya, por eso preguntaba... A mi parecer, lo poco que he visto, no ha merecido la pena. Una lástima que siempre estemos atrasados en este sentido. Gracias de todos modos! 😉
I care because as a human being with hobbies I have other things to do than write lots of code just to get this framework to work. If you want an easy web framework for Python, take a look at Flask, Django, or Bottle. These are provably easier to work with and take less typing. Don't get this the wrong way and don't try to convince me otherwise. It's just that I want to get things done and I can already do that with less lines of code.
If you want to add a little GUI, try [PySimpleGUI](http://www.PySimpleGUI.org). &amp;#x200B; Here is a little program that will launch Chrome using whatever is typed into the input field as a destination. ```python import subprocess import PySimpleGUI as sg CHROME = r"C:\Program Files (x86)\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe" layout = [ [sg.Text('Text area', key='_TEXT_')], [sg.Input(do_not_clear=True, key='_URL_')], [sg.Button('Chrome'), sg.Button('Exit')]] window = sg.Window('Window Title').Layout(layout) while True: # Event Loop event, values = window.Read() print(event, values) if event is None or event == 'Exit': break if event == 'Chrome': sp = subprocess.Popen([CHROME, values['_URL_']], shell=True, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE) window.Close() ``` &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
Pandas does this. But if Pandas doesn't quite meet your needs, then maybe \[datagristle\]([https://github.com/kenfar/DataGristle](https://github.com/kenfar/DataGristle)) might meet your needs: its utility 'gristle\_determinator" will analyze csv files and produce an output with quite a bit of information about them. In full disclosure I'm the author.
I can't speak for molten but I have been using another framework from the author of this framework, [dramatiq](https://dramatiq.io/v1.4.0/reference.html) which is a replacement for celery in production and it just works. Dramatiq just worked out of the box and is handling a bunch of concurrent tasks. We have not lost a task in rabbitmq where we have just randomly lost tasks using celery. 
Do explore the vfx industry. They are always looking for good python developers. Its an awesome industry to gather some valuable experience.
But Zerynth itself is not open source. MicroPython is open source and has a ton of open source libraries as well. It also supports more targets. MicroPython is the reason why there's a rise of Python in Embedded Systems. Zerynth merely tagged along for the ride. This article is nothing more than a thinly veiled advertisement for the Zerynth product that's capitalizing on the success of MicroPython.
The `&amp;` should go to the very end of the bash line, not in front of the `&gt;`. $ echo "print('hello')" &gt; hello.py $ python hello.py &gt; logfile &amp; [1] 19465 $ [1]+ Done python hello.py &gt; logfile $ cat logfile hello 
If you solve the calling dlls from Python and are simply looking for a GUI that runs on Windows and the Pi, then take a look at [PySimpleGUI](http://www.PySimpleGUI.org). Copy a recipe from the [cookbook](http://cookbook.PySimpleGUI.org) and get up and running in a few minutes. You won't need a GUI builder. It's super easy and you can make any layout you want. It's worth the 5 minutes it'll take to give it a try. &amp;#x200B;
RPis are particularly difficult since they by default don't have kernel headers.
the flask website is pretty ugliest!
MicroPython + ESP32 is awesome!
As I tried to mention before, I am really happy with flask and also with their documentation. My problem is because of the font which is a serif font and I think it looks more like a historical text rather than a documentation for some kind of software or framework. Well ok, today displays have resolutions with up to 4k over even more k, and we are close to print quality (at least some people keep telling that, but for some unknown reason these people are using sans serif fonts while arguing). And as mentioned by others before fitting the screen is not the job of a back-end framework. I think it is also not the job for a front-end framework to fit every possible content to every possible screen size/resolution. It is like crashing your car and blame the car company for the crash. P.S.: Has anyone realized that even on a desktop monitor the logo on the top left is not fully shown. But that again just shows that the guy writing the documentation made a mistake (are added a feature; Maybe we will never know). 
I had the same thought. While it's not exactly the backend's fault, it still shows me that the developers don't seem to understand the medium completely, or perhaps that they cut corners and aren't 100% precise. Since there are so many alternatives, I'll give this one a pass. 
flask webpage is pretty ugly! 
Are the dlls (called assemblies in .net) portable? Do they do their work without depending on windows APIs?
The goal is not just to test ui only as mentioned in note and goal is not AI, as mentioned in title brute force is fine too. And even if program to test UI exist , which one does something like this and is website and workflow agnostic? I could not find any .
&gt;I think it is also not the job for a front-end framework to fit every possible content to every possible screen size/resolution. We will have to disagree on that, if you're gonna publish something you should make it functional in as many mediums as possible, AND today mobile is the most important one, so a website which isn't properly functional in a smartphone is a very bad one.
This is very interesting, I learned a lot! Thanks for taking the time to post this. I'll try to modify the script later today with your suggestions!
 On my smartphone the page is fully functional, so I don't see any problem with the framework. 
plt.axes() creates a new axis. You already have the axis object, so call `ax.set_aspect('equal')`. Or use `plt.axis("equal")`
Jupyter already does this. The project isn't a Rust kernel. It's a rewrite of Jupyter in Rust. You can install a ton of different kernels into Jupyter already. [https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/Jupyter-kernels](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/Jupyter-kernels)
This is not a framework problem man! I never said that, I said the problem is on the front-end (html/css), then you said it wasn't the job o the front-end making a website work in multiple screen sizes, which I replied it's wrong. And the page is fully functional, but you have to scroll sideways to read stuff, which is very bad.
April fools day rfcs.
It worked! Thank you again! I can now just specify the log file in the script, set `sys.stdout = open(log_file,'w')` and run `python script.py &amp;` and the log fills up. The only issue is that the linefeeds from the subprocess calls get dumped to the shell, which is pretty annoying. Any ideas on how I can prevent that without explicitly redirecting them with `python script.py &gt; log &amp;`? I would like to only have to specify the log file path in one location.
 Ah.. sorry mixed up the comments. 
Don't your tools pick up typos in identifier names? And what about your test suite? Is there any actual data that measures the reliability of code created in each prog lang?
Use `subprocess.check_output()` instead of `subprocess.call()` and just ignore the return value, or pass `stdout=subprocess.DEVNULL` to suppress any output.
Hey I just finished watching the playlist. They were well explained. Hoping to see further parts where you put that on the server. Also thanks for the digital ocean $100. 
There are more videos still to come on that topic. 8 more videos.
Once they are you, I will definitely be watching them. 
Ahhh, great idea. Thanks again :)

I mosty wanted to explore the Jupyter -&gt; Kernel interaction. I wanted to understand how the frontend communicated with the Kernel in more detail and this project came from that wish. Rust is my personal language of choice at the moment and I believe it has lots of promise. I consider understanding the client abstraction will open up possibilities of using the Jupyter protocols to help with more open programming standards and techniques (cross-language communication through standard means) which aligns well with the Juypter vision. &amp;#x200B; Note: I do not want this to be treated as a "rewrite this in rust!" project. I chose Rust as it is my personal language of choice, and I do not plan a rewrite of Jupyter.
True this project is not a Rust kernel. It currently is also however not a rewrite of Jupyter in Rust. This is merely an abstraction library allowing Rust to interact with a Jupyter kernel. I agree it \_could\_ be used to re-write Jupyter in Rust which I am not really wanting to do. I have thought of alternative frontends and how they might work. I have also thought about using Jupyter kernels as execution engines and programmatically using them to run code (early days for that line of thought... :P)
what a terrible interviewer 
I have written my implementation of popular game Game of Life, if you want to play it, here is a link to my [repository](https://github.com/kubapilch/Game-of-Life).
I just created this simple library for creating a RESTful API from a yaml file with just a few lines of text. As a full stack developer, I regularly need to build simple REST APIs quickly in order to build a web app prototype. This library allows me to do this with just a few lines of code, and I am sharing it here in case its of use to anybody else. &amp;#x200B; Effectively, this library turns a yaml file into a Flask RESTful API and implements documentation via swagger. &amp;#x200B; It's very basic right now, and still not yet documented, but I'm planning to add additional feature such as user management, permissions and the ability to insert your own code. &amp;#x200B; Thanks, Chris
Depends on your level in python but you can do implementation of [Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) like I did this week or \*A path finding algoritm in pygame like I want to do next week :). &amp;#x200B;

First, this sounds like a really fun project. I'm jealous! Before you get too far down the path of implementing your own you might look into whether something like this already exists. The idea that you'd like to be able to acquire data and/or control things that are connected to a raspberry pi is not terribly unique. In fact one thing worth looking into is called Node red (nodered.org). If that doesn't meet your needs here are some Python GUI frameworks worth looking into: Qt for Python (PySide2), WxPython (wxwidgets), Tkinter. 
Since UTF8 is the default encoding for XML (unless some other encoding is specified in the opening tag) having UTF8 chars in the input should be expected and not a problem at all. Conversely, having other types of encoding would be (and likely is) a problem. Except "not well-formed" is not the type of error I would expect - something along the lines of bad character would be more normal (OTOH, if the file is being read as binary, and it contains latin1 diacritic adjacent to a '&lt;' the parser might be consuming a byte too much and missing an ending tag. Lots of ifs and might here). Regardless, what do you have at column 2488186? Does it make sense in the context of well-formedness? In the context of latin-1? Of UTF-8? Did you test that the file is, in fact, well formed tossing it at one of the zillion-plus available parsers? Is any encoding specified in the &lt;?xml opening tag?
Now idk your budget, but wouldn't a raspberry pi be pretty cool? It's a great coding environment for simple apps, and there is less setup than getting a local environment running on a Windows pc. Otherwise I suggest more "giving them an envelope" style gifts where you write that you're gonna come over and get them started (or guide them over video chat or something like that. Great present dude!
get them an ebook that covers pygame. it'll cover installation and provide tuition. there's one linked in the sidebar of this subreddit (the "invent your own" link)
Upvote for just being a wonderful idea.
I’m the author of the R kernel for Jupyter, so I know what I’m talking about. I think you must have misread something.
Not sure if PETL will do this, but perhaps worth a look. It takes more of an iterative approach rather than a load-all-to memory approach, and IMO is much easier than pandas for a lot of tasks. Not sure if it does the type detection though...

exactly. /u/FR_STARMER must have misunderstood something I said.
Fantastic! I've never been to Switzerland, but friends always tell me how expensive it is. Will that be a problem in any way? Are you planning in offering accommodations or anything to cope with the price difference?
This question is more appropriate for /r/learnpython! Look at the parameter you pass into the hash function. It must be a byte string, so you need to encode it into a desired encoding. But you don't call the ``encode`` method! You *pass* it into the hash method! 
You forgot a `()`. Try this: hs = hashlib.sha1(psw.encode()) --- If you have more questions like this it's better to post them on /r/learnpython. Be sure to [format your code for reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/faq#wiki_how_do_i_format_code.3F) or use a site like pastebin. Also, include which version of python and what OS you are using. 
Honestly your packaging will be a pain to maintain portability if you're doing multiple languages plus a UI toolkit. If you're willing to stick within C# land, there are bindings to Qt's QML library https://github.com/qmlnet/qmlnet/blob/develop/README.md That'll likely serve you better than going through python just to access the same Qt library. 
No problem.
That's Lex Fridman, he has one of the best courses on AI that I've taken online. Idk what you don't like about him, but I'd tolerate his lack of "interviewer" expertise given his technical background and ability to inquire Guido. 
Find someplace with paid internships. Best way to get that crucial first year or two of actual practice that no amount of schooling(or self training) can provide. Nothing helps like project managers, QA, sr devs with biases for or against other technologies, patterns, stacks etc. because that's what most real programming jobs look like. (source: me, a twenty year veteran who has been most of those jobs and been mentor over several of them).
Thank you again!
ok thank you so much! Finally works :)
That is what called "argument of authority". Just because he has technical background and ability to teach AI, does not make him a good interviewer. He can be an excellent teacher and also a very shitty interviewer. 
Your welcome. Just ask if you need anything else😁👍
Came here to suggest this.
Such a weird interview, kicking off with a question about the nature of good and evil. The interviewer sounds disinterested, and trying to push his own ideas. It got really near to good in places. So funny when Guido asks permission to off on a tangent, and uses a programming analogy to describe a philosophical question. I was hoping he would talk exclusively about his specialised field, python &amp; programming. Guido's great but no more qualified to answer most of these questions than anybody else.
&gt; vfx industry What's that? Virtual forex? 
This depends on your background, if your a data scientist that now knows python, a job in ML or DA would be relatively easy land. If not, web development with python for an organization that relies heavily on ML and DA would be the way to go.
It's hilarious because one of the top youtube comments praises the interviewer.
I don't think the guy above you said you're wrong. He left it open ended and to opinion, and added that a reason for *tolerating* the bad interviewing skills is due to the incorrect background.
You know, I'm in that beginner situation. I believe there are 3 distinct ways with its advantages and disadvantages of learning Python. 1) College (spend time and money) but in the end will have a **degree.** 2) Bootcamp (expensive) 2) Self-Taught Programmer. (this takes time and requires a lot of discipline) The big question is: Is it possible to get a job as a Web Developer without a degree?
&gt;you can add, remove, insert, or rearrange the items in the tuple, you must create a new one I think you mean 'you cannot' &amp;#x200B; &gt;a = \[ 1, 2, 'abc') # list -- can add, change, or remove items referenced you probably intend a = \[ 1, 2, 'abc'\] &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
Also the Rasp comes with a bunch of learning resources preinstalled (NOOBS)
The answer is yes, any of those 3 paths will work. It depends on you ability and aptitude which works best. I self studied for 1 year, while working full time, and then did a 5 month boot camp. Got highered on right away.
Read about `threading.Thread` class. 
Exactly, thanks very much. It's usually the argument with journalists or sometimes teachers: do you prefer someone with really good "communication" skills and lack of technical background? Or someone that is an expert but lacks the communication skills? Obviously you'd say "both", but in this case, instead of having a any other regular podcast interviewer, I'd rather prefer Lex. The questions are great. He has a ton of insight and a clear view of innovation and the future.
What country or world region? 
I listen to his podcast and it has taken me a while to become accustomed to him. The guests at least are very interesting.
There are a lot of people who don't like the things that Lex asks and how he goes about asking them. If you want some kiss ass interview praising Guido's accomplishments this is not it. This is for a course on AGI, on computation, on the history and development. This interview is awkward, I don't think Guido was expecting any of these questions. This is not Lex's best work, but he got answers that nobody else would. I'm sure you can find an endless string if interviews asking how and why Guido built Python. This is not one of them 
I had to make a GUI app that calls a couple of COM objects on Windows. I used Python 2.7, pywin32 for calling the COM object and PyGTK (GTK2) for the GUI. The I bundled the app with PyInstaller. What made it portable to winxp, 7, 8 and 10. Don't know what's the deal with the Rapsberry Pi though.

Remote positions are good, but most places will expect you to onboard for some amount of time before going remote. The things that will help you once you get in the workplace are going to be your experience with software development fundamentals. It's great that you're already using git, and any investment you put into getting better with it will help. Try expanding your skills - if you haven't worked in a workflow that uses rebase and squash, for example, try that. Get into unit testing your stuff. Figure out how to get coverage information, and how to get a test suite that can be run easily from your projects. Property based testing is getting popular now - using a tool like hypothesis can be something that works. If you have projects with tests, the next thing is making sure that they work. Try setting up continuous integration to ensure that new checkins are run against the tests. TravisCi is a great tool if you're already working on github. What you have to keep in mind is that the difference between working as a hobbyist and as a professional is that as a professional, you need to work with others. Being able to coordinate using source control and deliver software that is tested will be what makes the difference when you're on a team, and need to verify that you aren't breaking each other's work.

r/learnpython is a more appropriate place for these types of questions. But to point you in the right direction you should look up multiprocessing thread pools and the thread pool map function.

No you can read it too. But it will focus only on things that biologists need. Like python used in scientific computing is useless for web or scripting. Plenty of books and resources. Don't waste time on ineffective ones. 
&gt; First steps to a Python career: where to start? Don't frame yourself as looking for a Python career. Python is a tool that can be used to do many different things. You want to be a web dev/SRE/security engineer/pipeline engineer/etc, and you have experience using Python (but they might have you learning a new language on the job). Figure out what you actually want to do and that'll be the first step, because then you can start looking at requirements.

The hardest part is getting python code to read an image into an array. I think you can use the Python Image Library to get that and then you have to break the image into blocks and then average out the block. Then again, I think there might be a scaling thing in PIL to just give you an array with the exact number of dice you want and then you just scale the pixels to a value of 1 to 6 and you should be good to go.
Sweet! Where the fuck they get 13k dice for a good price? Best I see on Amazon would be about $1300
[argcomplete](https://argcomplete.readthedocs.io/) looks like exactly that.
thanks!

oooh, for extra credit, Blender can run Python... You wouldn't need physical dice...

You can see two examples in the res-folder. Enjoy!
I think it would be quite easy using opencv2. &amp;#x200B; Convert image to grayscale something like cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR\_BGR2GRAY) Scale image so that one pixel is one dice. something like cv2.resize read the pixel value something like pixel= img\[200, 550\]

Yes so the details get interesting... how many dice do I need for a good image? I bet that Blender helps determine? Not sure if it's easy to tell if it will work in practice in determining that on a digital screen. I'm not even sure how to figure out how many are needed dynamically for different images.
Yeah, I've literally written code for this exact problem using PIL, as well as a Rubix Cube version as well.
I should look at and understand the code... Does it have smarts to know how many dice one would need or do you have stuff hard-coded?
Yes so if the posted code doesn't have logic to produce the image with the minimal amount of dice we'll have to make edits.

Why do I care about Guido’s opinion on human nature tho? It just seems like an odd question to lead off with. Part of being a good interviewer is respecting your audience and the interviewee and asking relevant questions. 
It looks like it first resizes the source image (default 100%, no change) and then for every pixel it makes a die, and each die-picture is (by default) 10x10 pixels.
Hi there! We opened the CfP for PyCon Italia a few weeks ago, we are looking for submissions for any topic regarding Python! The conference will be in Florence, Italy on 2-5 may :) We really encourage first time speakers as well :)
Who is the audience for this interview? It's not just anyone who know who Guido is. This is for a class on Artificial General Intelligence, where questions on the nature of reality are reasonable. 
That's really great to hear!
Fair enough.
&gt; and then for every pixel it makes a die, You could optimize this with dithering. Each die could be 9 pixels (logically), and then there are six dithering patterns you could use depending on those pixels. No, wait, 7 dithering patterns, because you can rotate the 3 side.
&gt; Even when the next big recession hits in the next couple of years Why so much confidence on this? We have no idea what the economy is going to do.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, you are being far to reasonable here. I was expecting hellfire, or at least heckfire. kixlsd, you are my kind Redditor. If you haven't seen more of these MIT AGI videos, there are a bunch [here](https://agi.mit.edu/). And I have to admit, this was not Lex's best work at all. The interview with Max Tegmark went well, but I prefer the guest lecturer format. I like to hear a prepared presentation. Josh Tennebaum's lecture was pretty mind blowing. Cheers, Pour_Louis
Job market is hot right now, but markets can change, investor funds can dry up, and jobs can be scarce. In a recession or downturn no jobs are really safe. Things are good now and they look good moving into the future.
Managed to do it with FuncFormatter. My function just iterates, dividing by 1024 until the value is less than 1024, then sets the prefix as appropriate. Dead simple. Thanks for the hint!
Am I reading this right? It appears to say that none of the languages are unique in any way.
Cool about the dithering I learned something new. I agree I was thinking the same thing with 9 pixels logically in order to represent a die. Based on the code that was posted one could just resize the image to determine what the minimum amount of die required to accurately represent the image and do it by eye. I wonder what is the most easy reliable way to determine the least amount of dice required in order to make the image look qualitatively good. Obviously this is subjective to some degree

They've got some great resources: * http://www.businessinsider.com/career-advice-you-should-never-take-2014-5 * https://hbr.org/2002/12/how-to-stay-stuck-in-the-wrong-career * https://www.modernmom.com/018a34ba-c68e-11e3-b054-bc764e0546c6.html * https://www.monster.com/career-advice/article/thinking-about-a-job-change * https://www.quora.com/Career-Advice/What-are-a-few-unique-pieces-of-career-advice-that-nobody-ever-mentions
Don’t forget. Library developers can also define the __mul__ and __pow__ magic methods on a class to overload * and ** into whatever else the fuck they think functionality would make a cute API. I’m only half joking. I see devs overloading __rshift__ (&gt;&gt;) for “this is followed by this” __or__ (|) to denote function composition all over the place.
Huh, so this is how this works! Seems very easy now in hindsight.
That is called "being a douche" when you call out a logical fallacy by name.
Isn't (a,b,c) a generator? I thought tuples needed an extra, final comma, i.e: (a,b,c,)
Those results would be super inaccurate given the amount of sarcasm on Reddit that'll never be picked up by a sentiment analysis 
i did not graduate highschool. I don't do math well, my english is barely passable, regardless of being an american. However i am a fantastic troubleshooter. As a result i got my foot in the door at a lowly MSP doing apache troubleshooting years back, 20+ years later i am well over six figures -- more ops on the devops role, but still in devops. The same principles apply here -- if you are good nobody cares if or where you went to school. Results speak, paper hanging on your wall doesn't. 
You mean the lines drawn between communities are largely flag waving and not representative of actual divides? _shocking_
Php leads in negative comments and is last in positive 
sharing technology is a beautiful thing friend
That’s as good an explanation as any. There’s no way that PHP rates that highly in real life, for instance. That’s not a comment on the language itself so much as the popular sentiment that it’s awful.
Without clicking: Vader
Well, notice he is using 3s (and possibly 2s) for lines if he is rotating them to change their position; it might get a bit trickier... 
You're right and wrong, It absolutely can be picked up. There's a way to pick up subtext. There are enough external and relted parts to be able to put an algorithm togethers to tie them all together and make a legitimate assertion on sarcasm, and many other nuance of the human language. Im sure there are many people working on exactly that, maybe some already use it,
Dude. You're saying that the mood for sever programming communities is overwhelmingly positive. I can't back it up with data, but I also know that cannot be true. The dev community is by no means a happy go lucky crew. And thats what this seems to imply.
And if I don’t want to go into data, what other opportunities are there for ML and creating software such as apps for companies? I don’t know anything about data science so I’m not ruling it out I just want to know as many options that I gave availed to me 
If you slice the faces off the dice and crop so the size is constant, you can turn one die into six usable faces. How to do this cleanly is an exercise left to the reader.

Hell ya man..congrats, that's an incredible story!
No error bars, confidence intervals or p values. You can't conclude that.
Hardly true, 3 to 1 is pretty high . If a community had 1 to 1 it would split. I bet if you look at other languages the ratio is much better. For example Rust community is very lovely.
This is gross
The comma is what indicates a tuple. The line can be rewritten as b = 1, 2, ‘abc’ A trailing comma is required for a tuple of one element
Why do you need a MBP for python?
can you share the dataset used for this?
Do graphic design and video creator also
Whilst this creates islands of sort, how might you go about creating a more realistic continent like map?
I bet the results from r/PCJ would be the same
What do you mean? It's just a summary of 300 gb of data. If someone said a book had the word potato in it 37 times do you need a p value?
If those sentiment flags had confidence intervals and you plotted the 95% certainties of each of those lines, I would bet good money that you'd see no difference between them.
Great thanks. I’ll check those videos out soon. Cheers
I would look into server-sent events. It's a a super simple protocol that can be used to stream data from a sever to a frontend application (exactly what you want to do). Here are the good medium article that should get you started: https://medium.com/code-zen/python-generator-and-html-server-sent-events-3cdf14140e56
Of course, if you want to make the less interesting descriptive claim that PHP has more negative comments in this particular data set, you're right. But the inferential claim that PHP has more negative comments in the population of all comments is far more interesting.
Is this smoothed? I suspect it is and much of what little trend is here is attributable to the smoothing.
Thanks, I'm just learning matplotlib I'm a long-time matlab user. I don't know when to use `plt.` versus `ax.` versus `fig.` versus `plt.gca()`. It's all pretty confusing. To make matters worse once I set the aspect equal using your technique and then try to set the axis: ax.axis((-1.5, 1.5, -1.5, 1.5)) It doesn't work until I add the following: ax.axis('square') This seems like very strange behavior that `ax.axis()` didn't work after setting the aspect to equal, but I am just learning matplotlib maybe there is a good reason for it? 
Yeah, but people who frequent the subreddit are more likely to have a favorable view.
I’d like to see this as deviations from the mean since the lines are pretty similar.
your brain will melt if you try to read it and you are not a biologist
It’s a method. Perlin noise is another.
Just moved from java but I’m making snake app
Actually looks like all the threes and twos are oriented in the same direction
I just checked and you're absolutely right. Thanks for the clarification! 
It says JS and PHP get hate and ruby and python gets love.
OP answer in other comment that the sentiment isn't a categorical data, but a continuous one from -1 to 1
That's how I read it. 300gb is probably most of the comments in Reddit for those subs over the past number of years. You can't extrapolate this out to outside Reddit anyways
I'm pretty sure it's just raw number of words that are negative or positive and it's an exact value. There is no quantitative truth that an estimate could be only 95% confident about.
It's a bit funny how /r/Python is comparable to the other subreddits, when it have been described as toxic several times on twitter and elsewhere. 
Django has support for Channels https://channels.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ but it is dense. If you don’t need to keep that part on Django then https://github.com/joewalnes/websocketd is really really easy to implement

I'm surprised at the level of support for PHP... but haven't looked at it as an option for some time.
Format x axis so that it is clear that it is continuous data. Somewhat misleading.
Yes. The people in a subreddit will behave similar to the people in another subreddit, and mainly favorable to the subject. That make sense. Each subreddit is just a bubble, a circlejerk.

Hey where is Verilog and VHDL , I am sad 
Instead of per pixel noise, one could lay out little dots, circles, squares or whatever, then smooth, giving larger landforms. An area could be cropped too, then scaled up, smoothed again. One could do a subtractive mask, zeroing out pixels in an area at a random offset left to right, creating an area empty of land. Bunch of ways. 
I'm asking why you're confident you'll have no problem as a dev when the next recession hits, not doubting another recession could occur.
Can you run this for different city subreddits and correlate with latitude and climate?
That’s just, like, your opinion man. 
It might be relatively accurate though if they all have similar amounts of sarcasm. What I'm getting from this chart is that most languages have similar sentiment, which means similar people who post on them have similar backgrounds and language.

There's tons of ways to do the same thing in matplotlib. That's an artifact of its development history. My preferred usage is: fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(&lt;something&gt;)) ax.&lt;plot_command&gt; ax.set_&lt;something&gt; The `ax.set_&lt;&gt;` can usually also be called with `plt.&lt;&gt;`, as long as the current axes are the ones you want to modify. That's why I prefer to call off of `ax` directly, so there's no confusion. If you set the initial figure size to something square, you might not see the problem. I suspect (but don't know for sure) if matplotlib goes back to the original aspect ratio when you set the axis limits directly.
Doesnt this come present a descriptive view of the collected data? Why then would confidence interval or p values be needed here? 
I think that promoted comments may influence the results. If every comment was a blind top-layer one it could be different. This explains how the platform algorithm works.
&gt; I write code in a way that doesn’t rely on someone knowing whether (1) resolves to an int. I doubt that. I would put money on it as almost a dead certainty that you frequently use parentheses for grouping: x = 100 # for example result = 5*(x + 1) and rely on people knowing that the result is 505 rather than `(101, 101, 101, 101, 101)`. How else would you write it? x = 100 result = int(int(5)*int(x + 1)) *wink* For the record, I've actually seen people surround literal ints with a call to int(), as in `int(5)`. I'm not sure if that's better or worse than `int("5")` in production code. (Their excuse was probably "I don't write code that relies on the reader knowing the 5 is an int...") 
Disparaging comment detected
Where would one post 300 gb of data?
Generating patterns is easy. How would you ensure it is generated passable? That you can always go from given point A to points B and C without crossing the color?
Writing something like “int(5)” rather than “5” could very possibly be the programmer noting the importance of a number as an int, which behaves in a certain way w.r.t rounding and such. Beyond that, and mainly, I’m also assuming that the programmer knows some basic things about programming and what to expect from a sane language. I’m going to expect that they wouldn’t write something that’s on the verge of being counterintuitive, but I’m not going to expect that they know how all of those counterintuitive examples turn out in every language out there. I’m also going to expect that they run some basic set of tests on their code to make sure that it runs and runs as expected.
I was thinking POVRay would be fun too, as I have no experience with Blender.

Thanks for the tip about the workflow you use: that is very useful!
Yeah, I agree with you from what I could see... but that doesn't mean they aren't oriented differently elsewhere in the image. Good looking out though!
Totally correct! I added an argument --keep\_size to make things easier, if one uses this rather than --resize\_factor the image dimensions will be kept whilst the provided die-size (or default) is used!
There is a game library in python that allows you to develop very flexible graphical visualization and dynamics. Can be a bit cumbersome at times and maybe more than you need, but I don't doubt it's possible to visualize the stuff you have in mind. https://www.pygame.org/news An update to matplotlib for data visualization, especially for web applications is also available. Not sure about making it dynamic since I haven't used it for that myself. https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/
No probs! I think \[Terr\_\](/u/Terr\_) more or less answered the question below, otherwise feel free to PM me. Also I updated the code with some comments to make it easier to follow.

How the hell do you 300 GB of text?

Super confusing. 300gb of reddit comments, surely most of them were not in these four subs. How was the sentiment classifier trained? Was it trained in general English, or is was it customized for they way people talk about programming languages?

Nope. Honestly didn't even notice it the difference when porting my old bash completion scripts. Before I even think about jumping in to solve this, what kind of differences in startup time are you seeing and what would you consider to be "acceptable"?
Awesome, thanks for the extra mile! ;)
I never came across this type of customized operator overloading... 😲 Thanks for the hint! 
Only enough to find that they too rely on shell scripting for their completion functions, though with different syntax from bash. I'm not going to discourage people from writing completion scripts in the language that's most appropriate, but Python sure makes things easy...
You mean [argcomplete](https://pypi.org/project/argcomplete/)? Yeah, that's existed for ages, but I wanted to pull off stuff that goes beyond command-line arguments to a program. Stuff like associated directories, specific lines in files, stuff that argcomplete hasn't touched out of limiting itself to only arguments.
Useless data. Your telling me subreddits have fans them, with a line plot. Funny,
As a side note while this is a sign of a recession you can't say "of imminent recession". I've seen doomsayers say "there will be another recession in the next 2-3 years" all the way since 2010.
To be fair, you can't even claim that -- we only have densities. The problem with saying who has more negative comments in this dataset goes back to good old 100% of 0 is still 0 principles.
&gt; Writing something like “int(5)” rather than “5” could very possibly be the programmer noting the importance of a number as an int Only a bad programmer who doesn't know the language. 
What, no Perl 
Or if you are tight on budget, you can use C.H.I.P or Orange PI as well. They cost \~$10 each.
Because there are some fields (including most CS ones) that are widely independent of economic state in terms of availability? Recessions cause certain fields to go down in jobs. This is primarily due to a lack of demand, which is primarily due to worse ability to pay your employees, which is due to your customers not giving you money. The majority of momey these days is in ads and data, or from other businesses, from the perspective of a tech company, not raw technology. The amazon marketplace may suffer, but the AWS group will roughly remain the same-- they are business facing not user facing. As much as people love saying programming is a blue collar job and all that nonsense, it's nonsense. Sure one can consider it blue collar to an extent or if you have a shitty employer, but that's usually only when you yourself are also shitty or live an an area where there's no demand for a tech company to build a headquarters. Now if the economy goes full blown depression, you'll have problems, but still not as many as every other job that pays less and is less of a staple. 
Machine learning and all of it's variations is pretty much hyped. You can do something like sentiment analysis, future prediction, some data mining, etc
I think that a better model would represent the number of actual comments somehow. It would be nice to model the comments as drawn from a distribution of the real sentiment. Not sure how it would look though. 
Wow! 300GB of text is **A LOT OF TEXT! **
I love these kind of visualizations! Thanks for the post!

[Looking | Earth ] I was let go from my company today. I live in Belgium, but I'm looking for a job anywhere on Earth. If you know a company that I might be a good fit for, please let me know/refer me. I've been working as a data scientist and the company's resident Python expert. (I was helping them migrate from 2 to 3.) My undergrad and masters were both in Mechatronics, and I'm probably still good at mechanical design. I have an Engineering degree, and I'm registered as an Engineer in Training in Canada. My best (human) languages are probably English, Japanese, and French. I can also speak Spanish, German, Dutch, Lebanese, Arabic, among others. I've lived in Japan for 4 years, and I'm really comfortable there, too. I'm interested in machine learning and data analysis, automation, space, medical devices, longevity, and more!
``` if last == 0 or last == 2 ... ''' can be replaced with ``` if (num % 2) == 0: ``` and you can actually make a prime number generator in a few lines ``` from math import sqrt primes = [] for i in range(1,100): found = False for j in range(2, int(sqrt(i)+1)): if i % j == 0: found = True break if not found: primes.append(i) ``` 
Optimization u can make: check odd numbers only (num+=2) after dealing with 2. Check for odd divisions until the square root of the number only. Or try the sieve of eratothenes..
It would be cool to have /r/haskell in there
Great! Do that. *cough* sys.argv *cough*

&gt;flit Looks nice, thanks for sharing. 
the things you listed are not on the same level, i mean yes there should be one way to do one thing, but multiple tools for multiple things is also reasonable.
I'm interested in studying the code involved, actually. 
Would it be possible to share the code used to analyze the data and achieve these results? 
Sure is, although the 300GB is the size of the whole data set. Subsetting for the relevant subreddits makes it a lot smaller.
The whole dataset is 300GB but naturally the subsets relevant for each subreddit are a tiny fraction. [See this paper for details on performance and training of the classifier used.](http://comp.social.gatech.edu/papers/icwsm14.vader.hutto.pdf) 
It is smoothed but the raw histogram has the same trends. The smoothing does not really impact the profile much.
Oh yeah, it absolutely could be picked up. It's not as though people struggle with it over text, so I'm sure it can be algorithmically defined.
That's quite a fun optimisation constraint on the program too then 
This. I think it would be interesting to detect the topics (i.e. what programming language is being discussed) of comments/threads on some general programming subreddits, and then evaluating the sentiment of those. That tangent aside, I think this post could imply two things: 1) people seem to feel about their preferred languages in similiar fashions, and/or 2) people’s aggregate sentiment on any given (neutral) topic seems to be slightly biased to positive. Or something. I don’t know. Interesting none the less. I need to download some Reddit comments again.
Isn't this needlessly convoluted? `import numpy as np` `import matplotlib.pyplot as plt` &amp;#x200B; `data = [[20, 20, 20, 20, 0, 0, 0], #B1` `[ 0, 30, 30, 0, 0, 0, 0], #B2` `[ 0, 40, 40, 40, 40, 40, 0], #B3` `[ 0, 0, 0, 0, 10, 10, 10]] #B4` &amp;#x200B; `bars = np.apply_along_axis(np.max, 0, np.array(data))` [`plt.bar`](https://plt.bar)`(np.arange(1,len(bars)+1),bars)`

An other algorithm to generate maps is the Perlin noise in the Noise package (available with pip) see https://github.com/caseman/noise
This graph is surprising to me. Especially that Ruby and PHP would be so high. I would expect them to be that high years ago but not now. What is the date range for this information?
So did you download the entire Reddit site? Lol
Ah, so you don't care about the verbosity of how they work but about the verbosity of how to use them, got it. I've used all the frameworks you mentioned and more, some of them in a professional context. And I really don't see how Molten is more verbose than the others. It's literally a single line per route. Can you show me what you mean?
2 recessions in the last 20 years caused many devs to lose their jobs. You're naive to think the job is recession proof.

Every recession since 1967 has followed the unemployment low within 6 months. There are very predictable patterns if you look at available data. And if you take financial advice from the Jim Cramers or Alex Jones of the world seriously, god help you
I see this is how they made RPGs back in the day.
I joined the workforce in 2008, recession in full swing. Switching to software dev is how I was able to get employment in a brutal labor market. And it wasnt hard. Sure, companies fail in recessions. But the engineering skillset is always in demand. Moreso today with the importance of data science and engineering.
Perlin is what Minecraft uses
Glad you got hired. Your story inspires me!
What are you on about? I don't even know who Jim Cramers is and Alex Jones is insane? Is this what reddit is now? Disagreements turn into "you must be an alt right idiot"?
It's not recession proof but it's more resilient than other fields.

I *assume* this is a binary **search** tree, meaning it would be ordered less than root on left, greater than on right. this would be why it breaks up as it does also probably a better question for a comp sci specific sub
I...ummm....okay. Maybe I'm just missing something here, but I'm nearly positive you're recommending code that's super vulnerable to SQL injection. Always use prepared statements when dealing with database queries.
Very true thanks for pointing that out, I still tend to prefer the ' '.join(['line1', 'line2', ]) option since that allows for spaces to be included between lines once concatenated but without me having to account for them; though I noticed now that I didn't include a space character when calling the join method in any of the instances in the code (fixed now) .. also I realized that in the haste of writing it up yesterday night it seems as if I forgot how to operate basic English spelling and grammar 
Yes it's indeed vulnerable. However, since OP code contains serial, I thought that this is going to be in a local server
Absolutely do not use that sample code. The reason the semicolon is an issue is because you're inserting unsanitized user input into your database query. This leaves you open for an attack called SQL injection. Try this: mycursor.execute("INSERT INTO echo (distance) VALUES (%s)", (res,))
insert 5: 5 insert 42: is it less than 5? no add it to the right 5 \ \ \ 42 insert 0 : is it less than 5? yes add it to the left 5 / \ / \ / \ 0 42 insert 15: is it less than 5? no go right is it less than 42? yes add it to the left 5 / \ / \ / \ / \ 0 42 / / 15 insert 42: is it less than 5? no go right is it less than 42? no add it to the right 5 / \ / \ / \ / \ 0 42 / \ / \ 15 42 insert 4: is it less than 5? yes go left is it less than 0? no add it to the right 5 / \ / \ / \ / \ 0 42 \ / \ \ / \ 4 15 42 insert 5: is it less than 5? no go right is it less than 42? yes go left is it less then 15? yes add it to the left 5 / \ / \ / \ / \ 0 42 \ / \ \ / \ 4 15 42 / / 5
There seems to be some sort of bias towards sentiments which are not neutral which is very interesting
oh interesting ! thank you, well the input is coming from an arduino sensor, so am not worried about that haha ! but am having a second issue, its something with python rather than mysql the sensor returns ( Got: 123) and am only interested in the digits to insert into mysql db, when i use split() and store the resulted array index 1 into a variable to use in the sql command, the script soon breaks with error array out of bound !, so is there a way to take the 3 digits without encountering that issue ? &amp;#x200B; i know reprogramming the arduino to simply output the digit is the simplest thing, but its in a remote box outside my house and its raining at the moment ! &amp;#x200B; rcv= str(port.readline().decode())#Capture serial output as a decoded string res=rcv.split() d=res[1] print(d) res= str(port.readline().decode()) sql = """INSERT INTO echo (distance) VALUES (%s)""" query = "insert into echo (distance)values('%s')" try: edit.execute("insert into echo (distance) values ({})".format(d,)) &amp;#x200B;
That's a fair assumption, but man. I just hope OP doesn't get in the habit of using format() on his future SQL queries. Imo, it's better to learn to do things the right way until you're knowledgeable enough to understand when it's okay to use the easy way instead. You and I may be able to make the decision to accept the risk here, but OP seems like he's just starting out. It'll take a bit of practice for him to get there.
Can someone explain what the y axis "density" means? Sentiment per time? Per gigabyte (though not sure how that would work)? Also, just as side note, expect this graph to show up on r/dataisugly if it hasn't already. Not only because pretty much every graph ever drawn ends up on there, but the use of a line graph in this context is really going to rustle their jimmies. On the plus side, it may well end up on r/dataisbeautiful first, before the uglies find it.
Conway's game of life!
I see, I will be more cautious next time. Thanks for the heads up man
I think just the subs in question
What is density?
&gt;sert 42: is it less than 5? no add it to the right Thanks for this - it all makes sense now. However, if I wanted to implement this to instead give me a tree - however with the multiplicies stored in the nodes, how would I do so?
Try something like if len(rcv) &gt; 1: d = rcv[1] # the rest of your logic else: print(rcv) That way you won't raise an exception, and you'll be able to see why your data isn't coming through in the format expected in the conditions that would normally raise an exception.
OP, I’m in the same boat as you, albeit a bit more earlier in the game. Just stopped by to say cheers!
Instead of inserting just the number - you can insert a pair of numbers so: 5,5 / \ / \ / \ / \ 0,0 42,210 \ / \ \ / \ . . . 
Same thing with me :(

I go them from [Dice Game Depot](https://www.dicegamedepot.com) for $.09 / piece. Total cost was just under $1,200. If you find them for cheaper, let me know ;)
Youtube is helpful,i might start learning python ashwell.Where did you learn?
CS majors are hugely in demand. You will get a good job most likely. To get the best job possible, I personally would drill down on machine and deep learning. Taking classes that get you to intermediate knowledge with those areas will net large dividends upon graduation. To get further on deep learning, a good math background in stuff like linear algebra will be useful. For absolute best results, get related paid internships doing this sort of work. 
It's `flask_wtf`, not `Flask_WTF`. Case matters. Also, /r/learnpython.
Hi, author here. This is my very first library. I wanted to go further that other existing logging libraries by totally removing the duality between loggers and handlers. There is just one logger "interface" object that you use to configure handlers and send logs. Also, after using the standard logging library for a long time, I noticed several caveats that I intended to fix with this ``Loguru`` library. Feedbacks and suggestions are much welcome!
Thanks, but uppercase isn't the issue (I've tried it). I'll move my message to /rlearnpython, my bad.
The yield curve is not currently inverted, its flattening but it’s not currently inverted..
*Beep boop* I am a bot that sniffs out spammers, and this smells like spam. At least 50.0% out of the 2 submissions from /u/osamaajmal appear to be for courses, coupons, and things like affiliate marketing links. Don't let spam take over Reddit! Throw it out! *Bee bop*
Awesome 
What about it guys? &amp;#x200B; sql = "INSERT INTO echo (distance) VALUES %s" mycursor.execute(sql, (user\_input,))
Is this a wrapper that makes the logging module less cumbersome or written from scratch? I ask b/c the logging module is expensive to use in some resource constrained scenarios (PaaS, embedded). Ty and congratulations.
Well you are only one week into this by your own admission. Frankly I wouldn’t even worry about building something of your own creation until a bit further into the course work. Hopefully that course work is credible. As far as figuring out what you can do with your new found skills consider life around you and imagine how you might alter that world with programming. When I was growing up computers where not a thing yet, at least not for people short on cash. However my creative juices flowed into electronics /electrical systems. So I built a fancy launch controller for model rockets. The controller was far more elaborate than needed but incredibly simple compared to what one could do today for penny’s. The point I’m trying to make here is to fold your other interests in with your programming interests to give you ideas for programming projects. For example some guys are into distance sports like bycycling and might want a lot Book app. If you are into cars and working on them a maintenance log might be of value. The idea here is to find something you are interested in that might in someway benefit from some programming. Assuming you know the problem or activity well you can focus on your programming skills not the “business logic” behind what you are doing. What you may eventually learn here is that programming itself is rather simple. It is the design of the software and understanding the problem at hand that is the difficult part. If you can’t get a grasp on this your programming future is slim to say the least. However you really can’t design an app without first knowing the basics. This is why I suggest focusing on course work first as one week is hardly enough to get started. 
This is written **from scratch**. If you found some ``import logging``, this is because I wanted the library to be compatible with ``logging.Handler``. But internally, it doesn't use anything from the standard ``logging`` library.
I found [practicepython.org](http://www.practicepython.org/) useful for small learning projects, at the very least for some ideas. It doesn't walk you through but it does go over some basics and points you in the right direction, plus it provides a solution for you to compare against afterwards. Once you've build yourself up to have a crack at web scraping you'll have a useful outlet for your new found skills.
Welp, its settled then! &amp;#x200B; umm, wait, what just happened?
You have to ask it in /r/learnpython but the solution is like this \`\`\`bash python3 script.py a b c \`\`\` &amp;#x200B; And to get the a, b, c \`\`\`python import sys &amp;#x200B; sys.argv\[0\] # Will return script.py sys.argv\[1\] # Will return a sys.argv\[2\] # Will return b sys.argv\[3\] # Will return c &amp;#x200B; sys.argv # Will return \["script.py", "a", "b", "c"\] \`\`\` &amp;#x200B; And so on.
thanks for your reply ! sadly that didn't work, i found a workaround, i just use myarray.pop(1) to delete 1 index of the array. and that stopped the break, but now am having ANOTHER error \*eyerolls\* Failed to insert into MySQL table (0, '') and the sql command is : edit.execute("insert into echo (distance) values (%s)",d) &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
Smart bot.
r/proceduralgeneration There are much better methods. This isn't terrible, but it should probably be combined with another method, like perlin noise. The real fun begins when you try to figure out where lakes and rivers go. Assuming you don't get distracted by first creating a climate model based on the topography and ocean locations, complete with wind patterns... So you can determine your rainfall, so you can determine your lakes and rivers... Maybe add a sediment transport model, where rivers carve valleys and deposit sediment... And oh, shit, look at the time.
As I mentioned in /r/learnpython, /u/K99_ was correct: it really was an uppercase issue. Thanks for the help!

Check out [this link here](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects?software%5B%5D=python). This was made for projects that can be done using a Raspberry Pi, but you can follow along so long as there aren’t any physical components required. You can also sort them by difficulty, so you can keep getting more advanced as you learn. Some of the projects are actually really cool, too. Enjoy! And good luck on your coding adventure!

I have done something similar to this: &amp;#x200B; `import MySQLdb` &amp;#x200B; `db = MySQLdb.connect("10.0.0.1", "user", "db", "table")cursor = db.cursor()` &amp;#x200B; `#whatever your data is` `try: sql = "INSERT INTO tests (unit_serial, test_string, result_string) VALUES ('%s', '%s', '%s')" % (self.serial_value.get() or 'NONE', self.cmd_string, self.rsp_string) cursor.execute(sql) db.commit() except: print "Error: Couldn't insert into database" db.rollback()` &amp;#x200B;
I always implemented tetris on a new language I liked, start with just text-based, then add onto it. There should be plenty of guides out there! If you feel more confident you can use stuff like py-game to make graphics for it!
Cool, I'm doing this as a project, I need more pictures on my walls.. Now I dont want to spend 1300 USD on a painting.. What could I create from dice without needing a huge amount? Do you have any suggestions? I'm thinking about buying about 400x it was like 70 USD.
You need to use (d,) as the second parameter
and according to the graph, I guess /r/python is the biggest circlejerk of the subreddits analyzed. 
The first thing I actually remember programming was something that takes a unix time stamp and returns the local time without using libraries. If you want something less dull, try connect four or blackjack
oh right ! &amp;#x200B; edit: still same error ;/
I'm no SQL expert, but the "echo (distance) VALUES (x)" thing doesn't look right to me. I figure the table's called echo, and the column is called distance. If that's the case, your SQL statement should read: INSERT INTO echo VALUES (%s) Keep in mind that, with an INSERT statement, you'll need to provide values for every column on the table.
I hope to find a beginner persons to learn together ,and put a plan and resources and practice like poot camp

Try this project called "Plot device". It uses python for drawing on a canvas. It's pretty frictionless to start and get some immediate feedback through what you draw. It's only for Mac though, but I'm sure there's an alternative for other platforms. Here's a link for you. https://plotdevice.io/ I can add a couple more things to try if you want. 
Since it's December, you could check out r/adventofcode! It's a fun set of daily puzzles you can approach using any language. The puzzles get progressively harder, but Python is pretty popular so if you get stuck, check out that subreddit for some ideas.
My high school python class is online - last year is at [https://lasacs.com/cp17/](https://lasacs.com/cp17/)
I also implemented a feature where I would play against the computer. It has two modes, random or one where it will always win or tie. It was fun to figure out an algorithm to do that!
When I first started I spent a lot of time on Project Euler, although it's more a set of small problems (small doesn't mean that they can't be very difficult) rather than projects. Some might require you to learn some semi niche math, but that's a bonus. It's probably not the fastest way to become familiar with programming as a large part of your time will be spent analysing the problem to figure how to solve it conceptually and then translate that to code. Other than that I'm never really sure what to recommend. I personally don't think you should jump into a project with a lot of UI stuff and just stick to stuff that makes sense in the terminal or matplotlib. 
Thank you so much! So in the terms of getting internships should I build my cv or network within my university?
If I had to start over I would work on chess game. Here are some thing you can learn while creating it 1. Basics of Python (variables, functions etc.) 2. Object-Oriented Programming to create Chess Pieces 3. Algorithms for the movement of chess pieces and validating their movement (checkmate etc) 4. Pygame (library to create games) for the chessboard and piece movement 5. Artificial Intelligence ( to play against the computer) Would be a fun project.
I know this is a Python sub, but I wrote one in Java lol: [https://pastebin.com/XdcFTTn4](https://pastebin.com/XdcFTTn4)
Look at the example code at http://arcade.academy
I like it. &gt; All sinks added to the logger are thread-safe by default. If you want async logging or need to use the same sink through different multiprocesses, you just have to enqueue the messages. This is contradictory. If its "thread-safe by default" then you wouldn't need to do something special to get it to work correctly across threads. Second sentence means that it is thread-unsafe by default, but can be made thread-safe with extra code.
I’d also like to see it compared to sentiment on a few random subreddits for a baseline. Find out if programming subs are special or if the shape of the curve is due more to the algorithm’s bias.
Whether it's a good idea or not is probably indifferent to the backend language, so you might get a better answer in a subreddit that's relevant for your application domain.
Another possible interpretation: People doing something have to convince themselves it's a good choice, so they keep repeating it till they overwhelmingly outshout the doubt. 
Graphene is a good library with awful documentation. I would definitely use it if you're going with GraphQL, and I think the experience overall is pretty good. GraphQL, though, does not come natively with any support for filtering results, just setting the structure of results. If you're using Django, Graphene has support for django rest style filtering. If you're using SQLAlchemy you'll have to roll your own, but it's not that hard to bake into a base class. I was thinking about writing a blog post about just this topic today. I'll let you know if I finish it.
Someone single out /r/Python for being toxic to beginners because we recommend them asking in /r/learnpython instead. Some went so far as complain about the particular wording when people are sent on. Given the sheer number of beginner posts that are requested re-posted in learnpython, if those re-directions was in fact negative, I'd expect the sentiment to come out totally different.
Thanks for your remark. If this is ambiguous, I will reword it. The logger is *thread-safe* by default without needing extra code. The logger is not *multiprocess-safe* by default, you need to add ``enqueue=True``.
I agree. I would consider myself to be an experienced beginner as well and it really offers practice of some core programming concepts. I would be down to compare working code and share experiences.
Im a big pen n paper RPG fan, so my go-to project whenever I'm learning a new language is a dice roller. I start with a basic function that randomly rolls a d20, then I look at 'classes' of dice, then I look at rolling multiples of dice, then multiples of different, and finally making the whole thing visually interactive.. In pythons case I have no interest in Qt or Pygame, so looked into Flask/Django instead. If you have a hobby that involves numbers in any way, then the above can be applied in a pretty similar process.
I'm at about chapter 5 in the python class at automatetheboringstuff.com. Each chapter has some questions and a couple projects that really make you think about what you just learned. Check em out.
This looks very interesting. Do you have specific use-cases in mind for the library? 
On a reasonably modern single-user PC, especially one with a SSD disk, the difference is probably acceptable. But on the NFS3 filesystem I have to deal with, the startup time of your sample code is on the order of 7-800 ms. And that's enough to make completion feel sluggish. 
yeah, i’ve used it for a feedforward neural network. it could be used to design a physics simulation, where the objects represent bodies and the links enact forces/constraints on movement. just a few possibilities.
Only skimmed for a few minutes but this looks awesome! Good job :) 
You don't really need to rotate them in order to get a good result, [this one](https://i.imgur.com/CqiAE4c.jpg) uses about 8300 dices (91 by 91) and still looks good. I'd imagine the quality would be as good as the OP with 13000 dices. It would be interesting to compare two identical versions though, one with and one without rotated dices.
I have used graphql (with graphene) with our python backend for a year or so. It's good. It's not a perfect fit (though I am working on a library in my spare time which should help if I ever release it). But GraphQL is a very good idea in general, so you should probably adopt it and work around its python weirdnesses
Best asked in r/learnpython but this will probably do it for you. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/rename-multiple-files-using-python/ 
Awesome project. I wish I would have know of this before - it would have saved a lot of time. Just went through your docs, I'm going to go over them again now more thoroughly. Again, kudos on the project. The architecture is excellent, very straight forward. What are some of the most notable real-life applications that implement this framework? 
This certainly couldn't be more complex than the `logging` module, so I'll take a look.
Thanks mate, will check this in a few mins
Hello fellow beginner. I'm going to guess you're taking the autodidact route of learning python? If so, all the best to you. Feel free to bounce things off me. I'll likely get inspired by the question. Personally I've used quite a few sites to learn about python, but they are all pretty much the same. Completed the sololearn one. It's neat. What are you looking to do, games or apps? Here are some resources I've saved over time. Some I've used a bit of, others I use a lot. https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps #build a webapp for free using git https://gto76.github.io/python-cheatsheet/ https://pyformat.info/ https://www.twilio.com/blog/2017/02/an-easy-way-to-read-and-write-to-a-google-spreadsheet-in-python.html #To deal with some form of database without having to jump into SQL. https://hackr.io/tutorials/learn-python https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode #One of the most comprehensive typefonts for coding. When you're feeling adventurous and want to try some frameworks, as others will say FLASK
Maybe, maybe not... what's the problem the team is hoping to solve more efficiently by using graphQL? How much more efficient do they expect to be?
Nah, use this... import os def main(directory, name, ext): i = 0 for filename in os.listdir(directory): dst = f'{directory}/{i}_{name}{ext}' src = f'{directory}/{filename}' os.rename(src, dst) i += 1 if __name__ == '__main__': main('zzz', 'sounds', '.mp3') It changes all files in the directory zzz to 0_sounds.mp3, 1_sounds.mp3 etc 
I like the formatting. But don't see support for multiple loggers, filters and handlers. Am I missing something? It looks *kinda* fun to use during development (due to the way tracebacks are formatted). 
Great library, this is clearly what python needs ! Starred !
I'm making a downloader for YouTube
I've been using structlog and json-log-formatter for a few years because I output all services' logs as JSON, because I have so many logs across so many services that I only consume them programatically (often ingesting them directly into elasticsearch). The things I like from structlog are logging arbitrary key-values (`kwargs`) and binding important attributes early to be used throughout the lifetime of a function call. For instance, in a web handler, I'll typically bind some arguments that came in via the request and then any subsequent logging calls include those arguments, which is clean and simple for the code but also useful when trying to figure out later what went wrong. Does your library offer a way to log arbitrary dicts or kwargs and is there an easy way for me to format the output as JSON?
We're discussing a pretty groundbreaking topic. I'm guessing you don't understand big data analytics and the implications involved. It's like having a database of millions of people's everyday conversation, except only applied to internet interaction. The insights that can be derived have life-changing implications. Implication on AI and marketing are a couple of areas that will be entirely transformed by this type of intelligence. &amp;#x200B;
Yeah, agreed 110%.
Also a solo learning beginner not long started. My first project outside of book tutorials is a narrative twitter bot that tells the same story over and over with variable events and outcomes. Having a goal is key so "I'm gonna create this!" is the first step. I knew I wanted to make a story telling twitter bot before starting python. Not using classes or much in in the way of functions, just a super basic, chunky bit of code that would attract many a shaken head. But it works and its a confidence builder. Also finding a lot of things like having your code interact with twitter is not that hard once you find the right docs/examples to copy. Finding its not unlike learning to skateboard, one by one learning the basic moves then linking them together to do something a bit better. Then working on making it slicker and more efficient once you have got it working in a chunky way with probably 10 times more code than is needed. 
I took a look at your code. The ArgumentParser is definitely something I wanted to learn. Thanks for sharing.
nice work! looks promising.
I tried doing this, but I couldn’t get past one turn each. Would you mind sharing your code?
Actually, that's the whole point of the library: only one logger on which you call `.start()` as many time as you want to add multiple handlers, with optional `filter` keyword. You can simulate multiple loggers with `logger = logger.bind(extra_arg=42)` though. I you are only interested in tracebacks formatting, you can simply use [`better_exceptions`](https://github.com/Qix-/better-exceptions) (which is used by Loguru).
You don't need to cast True to a bool. What is j for? You only need to check i up to sqrt(num) The whole checking for even and 5's doesn't warrant a special case, especially one that converts to a string. 1 isn't prime. &amp;#x200B;
Back when I was learning CS, I would make a Mandelbrot fractal explorer in whatever language I was learning at the time. The math is pretty simple and the programs were fun to experiment with. 
Yep, I tried to write Loguru with that use-case in mind. There is an `extra` dict to which you can bind arbitrary data. You can use it in-line like `logger.bind(a=3).debug("Message")` or assign it for re-usage: `bound_logger = logger.bind(a=3); bound_logger.debug("Message")`. While configuring your handler, let the `extra` dict appears in your format like `logger.start("file.log", format="{message} {extra}")`. Alternatively, you can also use `logger.start("file.log", serialize=True)` which will automatically convert logged message to a JSON string.
Thanks OP, I've heard from others that Packt books are not always the highest quality so good to get a recommendation. The books you mentioned are included in the $8 tier, so don't even need to buy the whole bundle.
Nice one btw i am also new to selenium and have just written basic tasks.....can you guide me from where to start

Graphql is great and graphene is practically best option in Python. It’s very stable and works well but performances are an issue when you start dealing with larger dataset (even a few hundreds). The author announced a commercial version (quiver) that deals with performance concerns but doesn’t seem to be getting much traction. There are hopes that v3 will be faster and should be still open source. 
You have to specify column name. Otherwise you'll get an SQL error 
Do both, I would recommend. But ultimately your best network opportunity will end up being your professors. Stopping by during office hours and building a rapport with a professor is a great way to find something. Even if it's on campus, it's good.
Solid work. There's definitely a need for more streamlined logging.
I’m sorry, no. I guess you also thing compile-time checks and declaring things as immutable is only for weak programmers too right?
By default, `print("abc") # prints "abc&lt;newline&gt;"` you can override this by specifying your end-of-line string, like `print("abc", end="") # prints "abc" and stays on the same line`
Not sure exactly what you want but try open source tools like Metabase
When I do that it tells me I have it wrong elseware. The issue seems to be with the space before the print of my dictionary entries

I haven't read the code yet, but I don't see anything about hierarchies here. One of the things that I really like about standard logging is, assuming all dependencies are using standard logging, I can enable debug logs for a single library or module within that library so the floodgates aren't opened for all code to start outputting debug level logs. For example, if I know some outbound requests are failing, I can simply toggle debug logs for the requests module. Does loguru offer the same level of filtering capabilities? 
&amp;#x200B;
Hi! Thanks for sharing this library! I think it looks great for new projects, which don't have an existing logging infrastructure. Have you tried using it in frameworks like Django or Flask? as far as I know Django configures logging in settings.py and I always found it a bit complicated. Maybe there's a way to integrate ``Loguru`` :-)
I'm in the same boat bro, which is why I can relate. I find myself in an endless loop of tutorials but I never actually moving forward and making something with what I've learned. Then after a few months, I completely forget, and need to start over. So I'm forcing myself to actually align the things I learn with a current goal in mind, which is making an Android app. I tried using Python in the real world, but I don't really have things I need to automate, so yeah man. Find a problem in your life and try to fix it with programming. I can't say this is a working model, still trying it out myself, but if we can relate on this issue, maybe we can find a solution 👍 all the best mate 👌
Thanks
Sure, you can filter logs using the well known mechanism of parent/child hierarchy. This is done with `.enable("lib.sub")` and `.disable("module")` methods. However, to interact with standard logging, you have first to explicitly intercept/propagate logs with a special handler ([see recipes](https://github.com/Delgan/loguru#entirely-compatible-with-standard-logging)).

I recommend [Python Crash Course](https://nostarch.com/pythoncrashcourse). It's a project based Python-tutorial. 
First three chapters are very basic. Chapter-4 is in exceptions and Chapter-5 is object oriented approach. Stuck on chapter-5 
I tested it a bit with Django, it should work, but I do not have much experience with web frameworks, so I did not know what was the best way to integrate Loguru. But you are right, it's definitely something I had in mind, I will think about it at the same time I am learning to use Django. ;)

Talk to people that joined the workforce in 2000 and 2001. 2008 the software sector just didn't take a big hit or cause the bubble to pop. That wasn't the case in 2000-2001.
No one seems to know or care how to get Subscriptions working with graphql-ws, so if you can live with that, then sure.
I'm actually writing something really similar to this, but now I don't have to! Can you add some information on custom sinks? That's my big use case.
The NumPy objects that are arrays probably have a __ str __ that prints a list. The __ repr __ is the methods that shows a representation of the NumPy object. 
`&gt;&gt;&gt; print(x)` calls `print()` which uses `str(x)` (which uses `x.__str__()` if available) to create a readable string and prints it. `print()` returns `None`, so the expression evaluates to `None`, which the REPL ignores. `&gt;&gt;&gt; x` has no side-effects; the expression evaluates to `x`. The REPL uses `repr(x)` (which uses`x.__repr__()` if available) to create an unambiguous string and prints that. [repr() vs str()](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1436703/difference-between-str-and-repr) &gt; * `__repr__` goal is to be unambiguous. &gt; * `__str__` goal is to be readable ``` &gt;&gt;&gt; class Test: def __repr__(self): return "REPR" def __str__(self): return "STR" &gt;&gt;&gt; print(Test()) STR &gt;&gt;&gt; Test() REPR &gt;&gt;&gt; ```
Looks like, for every single logging call, this library calls `sys._getframe()` or even throws an exception to inspect the caller frame and *guess* the logger name. This also happens for disabled loggers or log levels. Isn't hat a little bit expensive? A debug log statement in a tight loop would probably have significant overhead, enabled or not.
Hey, this looks awesome, and I’m going to use it in my next project. The README was confusing—ok at beginning but less so as it got to more complex topics. I wrote the below, then realized your links in README went to a proper readthedocs site that probably addresses all of this. So I guess my biggest suggestion is mention readthedocs specifically at the top of the README! That said, including original because it’s salient if one only reads the README. —Original— Logger compatibility and parsing sections were pretty hard for me to understand. The use of "record," for example, left me wondering what record was, and I still don't understand exactly what's getting parsed and what's done with it. I'm not sure where a user would re-enable a library log. Do mean an app/script developer using the library doing it after importing? User to me means end-user, as in the person using the app. The dict constructor in the library config part is harder to read than a literal (and formatted) dict would be. Part of that is I’m on phone (it’s Reddit after all) so don’t have 80 chars wrap but it’d still be dense with a proper monitor. Is enqueue=true all that’s needed for async/multiprocess safety? Everything else is the exact same, including shuttling to/from logging (if hooked up per compatibility section) and all the other stuff in the readme? The opt examples are a little confusing in spots. What’s an info exception, for example? In general, more context would be great. Overall, this looks hot though, and much more straightforward to me than the stock logging module. I’m going to use it in my next project. 
Right on. You've done a better job of something I've implemented for my projects. Starred.

Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit: - [/r/u_babell_] [Entry Level Python Devs - What do you wish you had learned before starting your job?](https://www.reddit.com/r/u_babell_/comments/a4fae4/entry_level_python_devs_what_do_you_wish_you_had/) &amp;nbsp;*^(If you follow any of the above links, please respect the rules of reddit and don't vote in the other threads.) ^\([Info](/r/TotesMessenger) ^/ ^[Contact](/message/compose?to=/r/TotesMessenger))*
So does [stdlib logging](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/b7d62050e7d5fc208ae7673613da4f1f2bc565c4/Lib/logging/__init__.py#L155)
The exception throwing should never occurs, it's just a fallback copied from the standard library in case `sys._getframe()` doesn't exist (for alternative CPython implementation). Is it expensive? `timeit` tells me `0.0776 usec per loop` on my (7 years old) laptop. You are right, ideally there should be no overhead at all if logger is disabled, but I'm not sure I can achieve this with my design of "anonymous" logger. Optimizing Loguru's performance is something planned anyway, I will think about it.
Hello, please check out [/r/learnpython](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython). It is a very helpful community that is focused on helping people get answers that they understand. 
Also, if you don't define `__repr__` or `__str__`, but define the other one, it'll just use the one you did define for both. Reprs are meant for clean output. Str is meant to be able to recreate the object by using the exact code that is output. Not that people (including myself) follow that too closely.
Only for enabled loggers. Disabled loggers do not have this overhead in stdlib logging.
Really nice and clean code, good job!
Also this is super weird but this is exactly what I have been working on through an exams exercise! I have been working on this problem since this morning, and just now I decided to take a break and browse reddit, when I saw this comment. It didn't strike me until later that this is exactly what I've been working on!
Thanks a lot! If you have any advices I would be more than happy to improve my skills. 
Thanks for your feedback! This is very much appreciated, because I really had trouble assessing the readability of the README. Once you work for months on a piece of software, it becomes hard to have an outside look on it. Also, I tried to balance between exhaustive listing of features and succinct description to avoid too long README, but it's difficult. I will not address here all of your points as you may already have found answer in the documentation, but I take note of it and will try to improve the README. If ambiguities remain, do not hesitate to ask me questions.
Haha it's more the other way around! I just started learning Python (and coding in general) 4 months ago, so if anything I am learning a lot from you! 
Your first statement is not exactly true. It would reuse repr for str, but not reverse. &amp;#x200B;
Game of life.! is a very good idea to start learning. &amp;#x200B;
Thanks! Reported and blocked. 
They're a spammer, please don't thank them. Report them.
Literally nothing. You can get everything step by step just when you need it. 
I'm not 100% sure how it works, but I think it might be possible to use another `configure_logging` function in [Django's `__init__.py`](https://github.com/django/django/blob/b9cf764be62e77b4777b3a75ec256f6209a57671/django/__init__.py). The original one comes from [django.utils.log](https://github.com/django/django/blob/b9cf764be62e77b4777b3a75ec256f6209a57671/django/utils/log.py).
I really like this, might be good for small programs. A+ from me on API design.
I hear you regarding objectivity. I’m glad my comments helped. Re: balance/succinct, maybe a basic repeating pattern per feature/subfeature of: &gt; Formatting Uses Braces Style &gt; &gt; Logger works like the elegant and powerful `str.format()`! &gt; &gt; Example: &gt; `logger.info(“Example showing {} style”, “braces”)` &gt; &gt; Result: &gt; `Example showing braces style` &gt; &gt; [Explicit link to readthedocs section] That one’s a little obvious, of course, but the gist is why/how/what/where: why use a feature, how do I use it, what’s the effect, where can I learn more? My formatting is way clunky and I didn't replicate your more elegant wording but you get the idea. Anyway, just a suggestion. Like I said, this looks really hot as is, and if I’d noticed the docs link earlier I’m sure all confusion would be minimal. Thanks for releasing it! BTW, you did notice the name collision with [the C++ library](https://github.com/emilk/loguru), right? Probably doesn’t matter across languages but NB. 
It was really a fun project. It’s always amazing to see output of your python scripts not in a command shell but in a GUI. So I really recommend trying to do it by yourself. You also will learn a little bit about pygame which is great module that allows doing not only games but projects that need simple interface. 
Don't take this the wrong way, I'm just curious. Why?
Made some scripts using OpenCV and numpy to convert an image to a group of dice inspired by [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/a411hu/i_made_a_portrait_of_a_friend_out_of_13000_dice/). This animation consists in an array of dice which are randomly rolling until they make the complete picture based on a grayscaled version of the original. [Here's the code](https://gitlab.com/r-russo/dice-image) if anyone is interested. Inside there are three scripts: draw.py which animates the dice using pygame, animate.py which generates the image file to create a video later and save.py which saves the final result.
Hi, looks really great! We still use Python 3.5.2 at work, what are the reasons it only works on 3.6 and 3.7?
Why the downvotes? Should I avoid calling things `list_` etc.? 
Thanks! I first started to develop Loguru using my Python 3.6 installation and didn't want to bother me with retro-compatibility for the first public release. Actually, support for Python 3.5 and PyPy was planned for the next release on my internal "roadmap". ;)
Thanks again for your advice, I will keep that in mind while rewording the README. Yes, I noticed the name collision, but it was hard enough to find a name that was not used by a Python library, so once I got "Loguru", I said I'm done. :)
Great!
I'm currently working on my weather data scraper for station data from germany weather service. It's my first project in Python and I'd be thankful for you to suggest improvements in general code design as well as error handling etc and structure of scripts. Currently I haven't used classes but might consider it, as I had seen it in similar projects. Also until now it's only a collection of scripts but not a real library. [https://github.com/gezzze/pydwd/tree/testing](https://github.com/gezzze/pydwd/tree/testing) Thanks!
Thanks for writing this. My first thought is, that there's already logzero (https://logzero.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) which has a similar goal and which has been around for a while. I guess I have to have a look at your project and see where the differences are. 
I think typically you import your libraries first and outside of the scope of what you're doing. I could be wrong. I often am. 
Yes, you should always have your imports at the top of the program, never in a function or method. This is part of the [PEP8 style](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#id22). --- If you have more questions like this it's better to post them on /r/learnpython. Be sure to [format your code for reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/faq#wiki_how_do_i_format_code.3F) or use a site like pastebin. Also, include which version of python and what OS you are using. 
I’ll do that from now on
Hmm, I kind of want to do software engineering because, I want to work on computing and software engineering is apparently the best job, and I want to get into it so I can have a good future in life, and yes I realized that they have C++.
Not *always*. Some exceptions apply, in particular for importing an optional dependency.
Generally it is best practice to do your imports at the top of your file before you do any other code, but there are some use cases for making imports at specific times. Importing is not free.
Indeed, Loguru is very similar to Logzero in the will to simplify logging in Python. Basically, Loguru completely gets rid of the standard logging library Logger/Handler/Formatter/Filter. It tries to provide an even simpler way of configure handlers through one unique logger. Besides, I also tried to come up with additional tools to fix some inconvenience with the standard logging (listed in the README).
So, then what should I use the init for?
You mean the __init__.py file? I hardly ever use it for anything. Its main use is to mark the directory as a python package.
Oh sorry, I meant __init__
Okay, I think was mixing up methods and classes there
It doesn't work, rip. 
This is so cool! Good job man!!
I spent the past few days working on a script to scrape Air Quality Index data for another project I'm working on so I don't have to manually check every hour and/or can collect data overnight. This was necessary because I've had an extremely difficult time finding any place that records this data. Airnow.gov tosses the hourly data as soon as it updates and wunderground.com only shows the data in graphical form without showing the actual values. I started two nights ago with a simple script that reads airnow.gov for the specific air quality station I'm interested in. It was hot garbage, written at 1am just so something would run overnight, relying on little more than luck to actually pull the data I needed. Now I'm very happy with my little side project that will always find the exact value I want, report the full value without truncating, report it with the current time, and do nothing on the ~5% no data was reported for that hour. I do not have a github account, as I rarely have a need to use one, but I hope it's acceptable to paste the &lt;70 lines here. from urllib.request import urlopen # This is needed to access airnow.gov import datetime # This is needed to print the datetime import time # This is needed to delay the loop # Define functions. # Define "now" so I don't constantly type "datetime." def now(): return datetime.datetime.now(); # Define a function to scrape airnow.gov for AQI data. def scrape(): # Initialize variables. int_flag = '' AQI = '' # Find the AQI value by starting specific and then finding terms that should appear only # once between the most specific query and the desired value. AQI_loc = site_string.find('Air Quality Index (AQI)&lt;br&gt;') AQI_loc += site_string[AQI_loc:].find('height=') AQI_loc += site_string[AQI_loc:].find('&gt;') # Now find the value, which should be the first number following the preceeding searches. while type(int_flag) is not int: try: int_flag = int(site_string[AQI_loc]) except: AQI_loc += 1 # Now log the AQI while type(int_flag) is int: try: AQI += site_string[AQI_loc] AQI_loc += 1 int_flag = int(site_string[AQI_loc]) except: break # Print the datetime. print(now()) # Print the AQI. print("The AQI is " + AQI + '.') # Save the datetime and AQI to file. record_AQI = open('scraped_AQIs.csv', 'a') record_AQI.write(str(now()) + ',' + AQI + '\n') record_AQI.close() return; # Main loop. while True: # Access the AQI data for Columbus, GA. AQI_url = "https://www.airnow.gov/index.cfm?action=airnow.local_city&amp;cityid=18" site = urlopen(AQI_url) site_string = str(site.read()) if site_string.find('Data Not Available') == -1: scrape() else: print(str(now())) print("Data Not Available: No data written to file.") # Wait until 50 min after the hour before looping. AQI should be updated by then. while True: if now().minute == 50: break else: time.sleep(58)
I haven't gone too far into the code, but one thing that stood out for me was for setting a level uses a string value logger.start(level="DEBUG") make some constants available from loguru import DEBUG, INFO logger.start(level=DEBUG) Less chance to get things wrong.
Conventional project structure looks like this: * root * pydwd * `__init__.py` * `other.py` * `functions.py` * README.md Then in `other.py` you can do `from .functions import my_utility_function` instead of what you have [here](https://github.com/gezzze/pydwd/blob/379a2650136ae2a778cc11c5dce2c1d38cffcf94/python/read_dwd.py#L5) for example. A couple of small things: 1. nitpick: no parentheses around return value 2. try to limit the number of statements inside a try ... except block - otherwise it's hard to know what can go wrong, see [here](https://github.com/gezzze/pydwd/blob/379a2650136ae2a778cc11c5dce2c1d38cffcf94/python/read_dwd.py#L29). 3. Small examples of the kind of data being processed would go a long way - for example [here](https://github.com/gezzze/pydwd/blob/379a2650136ae2a778cc11c5dce2c1d38cffcf94/python/pydwd_functions.py#L80) I have no idea what the filenames look like, just 1 example would help a lot. 4. Check out `pathlib`, it can make expressions like [this](https://github.com/gezzze/pydwd/blob/379a2650136ae2a778cc11c5dce2c1d38cffcf94/python/pydwd_functions.py#L24) go away and is a lot less verbose than the `os.path.*` and `os.*` functions. 5. At least provide a requirements.txt listing the packages you depend on if any, to allow others to check out your package quickly.
Thanks!!
I swear I just read a comment the other day on a real dice picture talking about doing this.
You did but it wasn’t in a programming sub. Some guy did this with a portrait of his friend. 
The other post, and your solution, neglect rotating a 2, 3 or 6 to weight on a direction. The larger the image the more it matters.
Did you use the dice sizes in correlation to range of how light or dark a pixel in the photo was? Lol
any question - ask stackoverflow before you ask your mid :)
I literally thought about writing this last night but I had to be up in 4 hours. Good work
This week has been very productive for me. The last few months I was on a data science learning detour, deep into pandas and visualization libraries, learning statistics a bit too. I was feeling an itching to get back to program making after listening to Talk Python To Me, so made a few webscrapers, and then my own package to speed up simple webscraping tasks I do(mostly combining requests.get and souping it).
Never liked logging module much and now I know why! Great job.
Subscriptions?
Good job dude haha. I like the transition (intended or not!)
dw, this is how I feel at work. For the past 5 years++. Lmao I think "imposter syndrome" runs rampant in the industry. It honestly feels like a never ending process though.
Something to the new people: Definitely learn all the dunder methods, proper list comprehension, know that Python supports type hinting. Maybe know Sphinx ....maybe...it's an alright opensource doc tool. I find that jr/newgrad devs don't know about Virtual Machines, making checkpoints or DB backups if they're working with it. Huge problem. Also, jr devs shit their pants if they ever have to touch a ORM like Peewee or something. It's not that bad. I recommend jr devs to take deep breaths (we have a large python code base) and they shouldn't be expected to know everything all at once.
You should not import a lib within a def. Always put them at the top: Refer to PEP (python enhancement proposals) : Generally accepted guidelines for Python [https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#imports](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#imports)
Guidelines are just that - not dictates. There are some useful reasons to import from within a def. “important is not free” best sums it up
You are awesome!!

This was my first python project. It was very challenging at first and got me thinking about the logic. It laid a good background for getting me into mainstream python programming. A beginner should definitely give it a try. 
there's always gonna be one..
more reach-arounds
python is ace. it's tops. it is the gas. it's groovy and funky.
Nice! Like the animation. Reminds me of dithering, wonder if that can be used to determine dice placement.
Great, can you also Do a transition from one Image to another?

Why learn an old Version?
That’s very nice! Thanks a lot! What do you think of a general file where functions are just imported to make them comfortably accessible , or should I go straight forward and build a true module?
No other book covers as in-depth as that book do. So only
I really doubt that. I learned 3.6 with a great book but that's in German - the Oriley books are generally considered great, surely there's one on 3.6 or 3.7. I wouldn't bother learning an old version of Python 3
you can use [vidir](https://joeyh.name/blog/entry/unix_tools_vidir/) for this task
No feedback :(
It's pretty common to have a "utils" (or similarly named) module with reusable functions that don't necessarily for in any one place. I usually reserve that module for generic functions (like algorithms or things that aren't really project-specific). Your pydwd_functions might be better called something like "parsing" or "data" or dwd since its primary concern it understanding the data you're processing.
I made my first steps into developing code to be published and used by others. It's really hard at the beggining since a lot of people here have the experience and doesn't seem a big deal, and I'ts really hard to get feedback on the first try. I'll publish again my work once it's done and maybe I get useful feedback, positive or negative, to realise my mistakes and correct them. I know, that's not a project, that's growing as a programmer. But hey It's a challenge and involves planning and management, why not call It a project.
Mark Lutz's book is an _excellent_ foundational text for Python, and while it is a little out of date the majority of changes between 3.3 and 3.7 are _not_ relevant to someone learning Python for the first time. You can go through the changelogs if you'd like, but virtually none of the fundamental language has changed, and that's what **Learning Python** covers. Yes, you'll miss out on f-strings, but the fact is those won't make any sense to you until you've learned **str.format** anyway, which it does cover. The majority of the rest of the changes are additions to the standard library, which isn't the concern of **Learning Python** to begin with. So personally I'd say yes, definitely, read the book... 95% of what you'll learn in there is precisely the same today as it was when he wrote it. The other 5% tends to be relatively minor changes, and easily adapted to.
You can certainly make a chat or in python. However I wouldn't recommend it as your first project. Do something that covers a lot of the basics, like a calculator for example. 
so all i have to do is download the software from [python.org](https://python.org), google how to code a calculator in python, and then do i save it as an .exe or something? i'm sorry i'm just really confused thank you for any help
Let's start by knowing what platform are you on
so where should i start? i have the software downloaded already. i tried the print('Interest Calculator:') and did everything fine but like what was the point? can i like literally make a calculator .exe or something? &amp;#x200B; my main reason for trying to learn python is because my school i want to eventually go to has a 60 hour prerequisite of it and i was just really interested in AI, and algorithms, and wanted to make something like cleverbot in python to really make me more interested 
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBbrSDGGOkw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBbrSDGGOkw) &amp;#x200B; what version of python does the guy in this video have? because my python literally just looks like command prompt
Don't be daft. I don't believe for a second you would actually write, or accept in a code review, the code you are defending here. `int(5)` when you know full well that the literal 5 is already an int is as useless and ridiculous as writing `str("spam")` or `float(1.5)` or `set(set()) # just to be sure`. It doesn't communicate anything to the reader except "the writer doesn't know Python". All you are doing is making a useless do-nothing function call and confusing the reader who is unlucky enough to come across it: "Wait, what? Why are they doing this? Did I miss something?" The only reasonable excuse for something like that would be if you had monkey-patched `int`, in which case at least its not a *useless* function call but **yuck**. (This might be acceptable for testing purposes, or interactive work in the REPL, but hopefully you wouldn't do it in production code.) If [Useless Use of `cat`](http://porkmail.org/era/unix/award.html) gave out awards for Useless Python code, this would win. Some more useless Python code I expect you would never write in production code: for x in iter(something_iterable): x = x # just in case the assignment to x didn't work the first time if (bool(condition) is True) is True: print(str(x)) 
Is the random rolling of the dice until they match their greyscale counterpart simply an aesthetic part of the video for the cool effect or does it serve some purpose beyond that?
This looks fantastic, thanks for sharing - may be worth trying to get it incorporated as the main Python logging library.
https://pastebin.com/qRBRbNEW That's what I have so far. It's a work in progress. The biggest issue is the way I'm trying to identify if a Pandas "object" column is a date (if the column contains times it treats them like a date time with todays date). However, it works and gives me something to iterate off of. I'm thinking it may be quicker to have the option to add a dictionary that allows a user to specific the column types which would add a small piece of manual work, but might make life faster overall. I'll definitely have a look at the other libraries mentioned to see if I can start to make this a little more robust.
Was the lack of indentation on the init in the first one actually how you had it or did you just forget to add it to your description here?

Sadly that requires knowledge of C or C++. I don’t know any of them
Thank you 
Yes, interacting with operating system APIs always requires a basic understanding of C/C++ - unless you can find a ready-made Python wrapper for it
1: have you tried Cm or inches to see if that works? Or is it only Celsius causing trouble. 2: this sounds simple but have you double checked your indentations 
just assign what you want to accomplish set an end goal then go about doing it and learn during the r and d phase for example a good example would be to fetch forex rates from google and post them to facebook :) moreover i can guide you some tools for this the top one being pyautogui trust me it will save your life
You were using a mutable as a default parameter. https://docs.python-guide.org/writing/gotchas/
This has nothing to do with the elif (which, btw., is not a function); the reason your code always takes the first branch is because "or" doesn't exactly mean what you think it does. In Python, "or" is always a boolean OR, that is, it converts both its operands to truth values (True or False), and tells you whether at least one of them is True. It never means "pick one", or "one of". Also, it has lower precedence than ==, so when you write `greatness == "F" or "Fahrenheit"`, then you probably mean "if greatness is one of ("F", "Fahrenheit")", but Python interprets it as "if (greatness is "F") or ("Fahrenheit" is truthy)". And because non-empty strings are always truthy, the second half of the "or" is always true, and so is the entire condition.
Well then. I gotta find free time to learn that. I’m a student so I don’t have much time right now. What do you recommend learning? C/C++ or JavaScript?
Aha I see. First of all thank you for your comment. So how can I make "greatness" attached to 2 different inputs? I deleted the "or" but now it wont jump to any of the branches. It will just finish with code 0. var_a = input("Number of choice: ") if greatness=="Fahrenheit": answer = (float(var_a) - 32) / 1.8 
Project euler .net is a great place to start, especially since a lot of the problems help you understand the basic arithmetic operators and how to use them.
Thank you for your reaction. No, I wanted to see if it would jump to another branch first, before moving on to the other calculations. I double checked multiple times before hopping on to reddit (I dont like asking advice haha) But since it probably such a small error, I can not really google it. Thank you for the tip. I deleted the "or" and double checked if changing "elif" to "if" would work.
Thanks for replying, i have also tried pyautogui..... recently i have been trying to get all the examination results of everyone from my college websites....but when i try with selenium it comes to know that it's a bot and captcha appears. When doing same thing with pyautogui, it works but i have to be very slow. How to do it with selenium without getting caught? Also can you guide me through some more tools
Py auto gui is the best , When it comes to alternatives to selenium moreover if you want to go extra hardcore you could use tor and hit refresh identity with pyautogui and yeah i dont exactly know if tor has support for selenium tell you what maybe we can work on thia togwther give me the website from where you want to extract results ill give you final code

Why importing inside a function is bad: Import statement changes global state of a program in a way other programmers (or even you) may not expect. So, to be on the safe side, it's best to avoid it. But, sometimes you really need to do this. In this case, it's customary to use `importlib`. This both solves the problem with linters, and gives you more control over how imports will happen.
??? I mean, he clearly told you, that you need to know C/C++ to do what you want; I don't see you interacting with that systems' library using JavaScript. Also if you take look at [this](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/SecBioMet/creating-client-applications), this should be achievable without many issues even if you don't write a C/C++ wrapper yourself and instead use [ctypes](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html).
Well I was asking in general. I wasn’t talking about the fingerprint api at that time. Just in general, which on would be better for a hobbyist

You can read the source yourself -- [https://github.com/conda/conda/blob/master/conda/core/package\_cache\_data.py](https://github.com/conda/conda/blob/master/conda/core/package_cache_data.py) But I was under the impresion that it \_is\_ just a symlink to the downloaded copy (if the version solver resolves to the same version, which isn't super likely given the constant stream of updates). As for why you have to install it, that's because the purpose of Conda is to provide isolation from the system and reproducible environments, which would be completely lost if your new environment had never had numpy installed to it but numpy still worked there.

True. That's a good idea. In this implementation I just take a pixel from the image and turn it into a die. In that case, looking at the neighbor pixels could work but I think it would be better (and easier) to take a block of pixels (same size of die), check the distribution of values of the original grayscaled picture and replace them. If I have the time, I'll give it a shot.
I just launched crudcast: https://github.com/chris104957/crudcast Crudcast lets you create a fully functioning and documented REST API from just a couple of lines of yaml. Crudcast is based on Flask and MongoDB At the moment, crudcast provides the following: - CRUD API generator - Multiple field types - Simple field validation - Swagger view with documentation I'll soon be adding the following functionality: - user management - authentication (basic, token and social) - permissions - post get/put/post/delete hooks - adding your own code and methods
Simply aesthetic. They roll a random number of times before they reach the real final value.
Thanks for trying man
Yes! I thought about that too. I don't know, maybe it's possible. The problem is that there are only 6 possible patterns instead of arbitrary dots. I know almost nothing about dithering so maybe I'm missing something.
Can you please provide a more concrete example?
You just gave me some motivation to continue learning python, thanks man 
2008 was by far a worse recession across the board in terms of jobs lost and wealth lost. And you actually saw stuff like coding bootcamps start to explode as people shifted towards getting more recession proof and higher paying skillsets
It's possible. I think some changes are needed. If I have the time, I'll try it.

Haha, I'm not sure how. It would be nicer if there were more numbers to choose from the dice.
[There you go](https://imgur.com/eOFnI68). Now you make the caption ;)
You can go one of two ways: either write two equalities with `or` in between, or use the `in` operator against a list. First one looks like this: if greatness == "F" or greatness == "Fahrenheit": Second one would be: if greatness in ["F", "Fahrenheit"]: On a side note, please take a minute to learn how to format code in reddit posts. It's not difficult, just indent code by 4 extra spaces and put blank lines before and after - but makes things a million times easier to read. Oh, and minor nitpick: there's no such thing as "degrees Kelvin"; unlike the Celsius and Fahrenheit scales, Kelvins are a unit of absolute temperature, so it's just K, not °K.
Np dude. 😁
20 years of writing/reading logs: hadn't had to change the value of "debug" even once. What I see in this post is a lot of confusion: 1. `"DEBUG"` is actually a constant (you cannot change its value). 2. `loguru.DEBUG` is not a constant (it could be a variable or a function in disguise, but Python simply doesn't have constants of this kind).
aww, I get to make the caption? ty! Am on mobile, so u have to edit it in Someone (replace this name): You can't make images by rolling dice randomly. Me: *does exactly that* Someone: [Insert surprised Pikachu picture here]
Top notch job, thank you !
&gt;If you're a dev, do you basically just come in, write, debug, etc your stuff and leave? No, not anymore. You build it you run it at most modern places. You might be able to throw code over the wall in a minority of places but that way of working is dying out. 
That's a matter of what you want to do/achieve. They are completely different languages, that are fit for completely different purposes.
Which is funny cause Minecraft generation still looks a lot like op
Well I searched around and decided on C#. It seems like the thing I want to start working on so that problems solved
Yes, C# is an amazing language - incredibly versatile, nice syntax and always improving even more
bro, they simply A-F-R-A-I-D python, and the entire open source community in general eating their share and they run out of options they charge insane amount of money for things u can easily find for free and often more updated and more better solutions my team which is 12 eng ditched matlab for python 2 years ago and we never looked back, only question left is what took us so long to make the change
Sometimes it is necessary to avoid circular imports and can be better in some cases. 
Well that makes sense though. Basically your responsibility is what you build right? Like no one's gonna come asking about random unrelated shit? &amp;#x200B; Or rather could you expand a bit on what you mean by "you build it you run it" so I can make sure I'm understanding you correctly?

Pycuda and/or its sister project pyOpenCL: https://pypi.org/project/pycuda/ 
&gt; only question left is what took us so long to make the change Probably thousands of lines of MATLAB code that needed to be ported. Nothing brings a project to a screeching halt faster than a replatform. 
I once gently suggested to the company's CTO that we should upgrade Matlab. After all, we were using R14 which came out in 2003 I think, and it was about... 2010. He didn't answer. He just smiled, open his filing cabinet and rummaged through a few folders, then pulled out the quote Mathworks sent him for an upgrade a few years ago. I believe they wanted $120,000 for the commercial license of Matlab, Simulink and a few DSP related toolkits, for a few permanent licenses and a few floating ones, I can't remember the exact mix. "Or, we could continue using the Matlab licenses we have and write any new code with numpy and scipy," I said. I'm sure this happened for many of Mathworks' small commercial customers. People can get a little unreasonable when they lose millions of dollars.
Because that's how marketing works
 Why do I not hear much about octave? Is it popular?
What?
It's just gimped MATLAB. It has all of the flaws of MATLAB as a language, but none of the more valuable toolboxes, simulink etc.
&gt; I’m a student so I don’t have much time right now. That was the last time I remembering having time. :)
I can see that when I look back at earlier years. Back then I thought I had no time but now I wish I was younger. Now it’s just that I’ve messed up my schedule big time and I’m a big procrastinator. I’m trying to get myself sorted so I wouldn’t feel anxiety and rush all the time
yep, it was all legacy
I can't comment on it's popularity, however its MATLAB compatibility is astonishing. Among other MATLAB-like software (SciLab, FreeMat and Julia) it is the most compatible one to a point they consider any non-compatibility as bug. However I think Julia has the brightest future.
dont worry about them too much, they got so many locked in their garden for years of great $$$$$$
I haven't benchmarked this, so take this with caution, but if your images really are that size, and all you are doing is counting non-black pixels (or halting if even one is found) this task is probably I/O bound with numpy and for sure is with some simple C that you can outsource to Stack Overflow (please don't get angry I said that).
3.0 to 3.2 is weird. 3.3+ to 3.anything-newer should be consistent. If not, there will be serious repercussions.
Twitter(pot) calling /r/python(kettle) toxic(black)

I used Octave for Ng's course on Machine Learning. It's an impressive Matlab clone. It's also kinda janky and awkward. Pandas + Jupyter is such a nicer setup it's hard to get excited about using Octave. And if you're in a serious Matlab shop I suspect Octave can't quite cut it.
Too bad Javascript is over 450k...
Well. It does power the web. Maybe one day...
They don't...
Matlab is more of a single function language. Learn python and you can expand into other areas. 
20679 physicians say Lucky Strikes are less irritating!
Classes should have their private attributes (_ at the beginning of the variable) and should be handled with getters and setters, to continue with the principle of encapsulation. Anything speak to me
Executing functions in strings sounds like horrible practice. 
Cool package! In normal python logging, there's a convention for each module to use a different logger based off the module name like `logging.getLogger(__name__)`. Do you plan on doing anything similar with your package?
I learned on Beazley's 2.7 book (which did touch on 3.x) and went right into coding 3.x. 2 &gt; 3 of course has more changes, but any fairly recent Python book should be adequate to get started.
I was bummed when I graduated college and wouldn’t have access to MATLAB anymore, but once I picked up Python I never looked back. I believe it’s only a matter of time until Python is the most common too. Of course, MATLAB has simulink and other things that make it great, just like R has its own niche packages, but Python being a general purpose and open source language makes it so much digestible for the average programmer.
Makes sense. Matlab is *everywhere* at my workplace (US government, defense sector). There's some really neat specialized tools in there that some people really do need and can't easily get elsewhere, so it has its usefulness, but a year or so ago I helped make the case to management that we should stop paying for thousands and thousands of Matlab licenses that weren't being used and just let folks install Anaconda on their work laptops. That's still an ongoing process, but people lost their shit about the prospect of change and general resistance to FOSS.
Having subbed around 3 hours ago, I feel somewhat proud.
My dad’s company had buy a license for every core they were using. The bill for hundreds and hundreds of cores was impressive. 
Yeah well, the problem is that I'm waiting for a function to finish execution... not that I can't add on more dots.
The thought of a larger codebase written in Matlab terrifies me
The popularity of Spyder proves Mathworks does sort of have people by the balls largely just due to lazy inertia...but jfc is it bad how tight they have people who aren't even using any of the toolkits or anything like that.
My favorite story about Matlab comes from reddit a few years ago. Some poor soul spent an entire summer ripping his hair out about why his complex inputs resulted in pure real outputs... Well, it turns out that when you use i and j as a loop variable, Matlab will just silently overwrite their value as the complex root. Which, sure, fine, I get the argument for, but given the target audience of Matlab (people who don't really know how to code who'd like to code up the equations they see in their math/physics books), you'd think there'd be some kind of warning about, "You're about to overwrite the complex root, are you SURE that's what you'd like to do?"
You create new interpreters for each project (which can be virtual environments) to avoid polluting your main system python or conflicting with other projects. 
I see, I’ll keep doing what I’m doing then!
Congratulations 🖤🔥
hey, time to celebrate! congrats!
I use R for data analysis and visualization and Python for pretty much everything else. I prefer the matrix syntax in R to numpy because it feels more intuitive (maybe because I learned it first). That being said, I agree that everyone should learn Python because it is such a versatile tool while R and Matlab are for more niche applications.
I have written my Bachelor's thesis software in MATLAB and my Master's thesis in a hybrid of MATLAB and Python as pure MATLAB was horribly slow. At least for image processing, I'll never use pure MATLAB again unless the salary is compensating the pain. MATLAB loops are inefficient and expensive, just to name something specific.
My experience with Octave was that it was just close enough to let you follow along with Matlab-oriented guides if you had a compelling reason to not want to get involved with Mathwork's licensing despite qualifying for a free educational licenses, but *just* different enough to leave you tearing your hair out over the guide commands not QUITE working.
Uhm, 131 is an 8-bit value, 3 of them set.
The two big things about Matlab/Octave are if you've literally never coded but need to code something up (e.g. the equations in your math/physics book), Matlab has your back. And there's the aspect of lots of mathematical methods/etc guides being written geared toward Matlab...sometimes it's worth just copying along instead of reinventing the wheel (this is also the sort of guide where Octave is probably going to shine). As for "straight" Matlab...the toolkits I guess. But I'd wager that for the majority that's NOT their introduction to Matlab.

Thank you for the feedback! Now reading about attributes, getters and setters.
Hey! Actually, the `__name__` value of the current module is automatically used when you log a message, this is why you don't need to explicitly `getLogger()` at the beginning of your module, `from loguru import logger` should suffice.
lmfao that's brutal. There is absolutely no good reason for a language to do that
But what's the exchange rate?
It's got a gigantic built-in following in fields like numerical analysis...in my grad school numerical methods class, we were given the choice of a few different languages (IIRC Matlab, Python, and Java), and Matlab was the option that was basically "this isn't a programming course so we're making Matlaban option" option. Excluding the various Toolbox users, I'm convinced that's the only real reason Matlab has the following it does. It gives people enough of a footprint to feel like they shouldn't need more, but doesn't entice people enough into wanting to pay more.
Had modules for MATLAB and Python this semester. All I have to say is 'FUCK MATLAB'. To me, it's a horrible language to read, performance wise it was medicore, and the IDE can go fuck itself. Fuck MATLAB and fuck anyone who uses it. I hate that piece of shit, and seeing this post angered me. Bunch of arrogant cunts who wrote that. 
Right? And as I tried to allude to, the target audience for Matlab is probably less qualified than a general CS audience to figure out what's going on and to correct it.
MATLAB does have a broad specialty library and some very focused products around engineering and science other than stats and machine learning. It will be around a long time due to a very mature codebase and the comfort level CFOs have with paid products. I think you're right though, both Mathworks and SAS have to be looking at Python and R with some trepidation.
Hm, you may change that function to generator by adding yield. Short example: def search_data(fd): """iterates stream and returns True if there is something in chunk""" while 1: chunk = fd.read(2048) if not chunk: # end of stream return False if 'something' in chunk: return True yield if __name__ == '__main__': print('Starting...') with open('example.txt') as fd: for status in search_data(fd): if status == True: print('Found something!') break time.sleep(0.5) print('.', end='') But if you could not rewrite function to simple generator like there, then maybe you should look at [asyncio](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html).
Sounds like you need [threading](https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html)
Can you show how I could implement this?
I've never used it, but I know it's a solution for running an independent sleep and print loop
The function isn't running while you sleep here, right? 
Maybe look into regex (and build a very complex re) to kinda get the direction of the Users input and have it respond based on a library of sentences. I don't think a chatbot can really be an easy project. Maybe(likely) there also is a ready to use natural language processing library but I don't think that's be that much fun :D
It is very hard to convince someone if something, when their pay check dictates otherwise. If I depended on a fat pay check from Mathworks to pay the mortgage and feed my kids, I’d probably find even more cherry-picked scenarios to prove its advantages. As I do not, I am free to say: MATLAB is crap. It has a ton of toolboxes, that.’a true. But, it is not written in a way that induces organized large code based. Plus, it is ridiculously slow. And its price tag is ridiculous. The only reason they are still relevant is because they give themselves for free to academia. So, you get a lot of junior engineers addicted to it.
I joined last week, so I helped. Woo.

Has anyone used SageMath? How does it compare to MATLAB, Mathematica etc?
It's a question. 😉

Your question doesn’t make much sense hence the rating. 
You don't need an \_\_init\_\_.py for scripts. The point of \_\_init\_\_.py is to make the directory a package so that you can import its files using something like `import package.module`. \_\_pycache\_\_ is a unrelated folder that holds compiled bytecode so that you don't need to recompile the script each time you run it. If you make changes to the script, python is smart enough to recompile and replace the old file.
Change can suck if you have invested years into a solution that you know inside and out. This is true of any industry or technology. Industry got a lot of resistance from the change from 2D drafting apps to 3D modeling years ago. It is all about not wanting to learn the newest and greatest solutions mixed with a bit of distrust. Honestly though I really think Pythons heyday as a solution in the world of engineering and science is about to peak and then slowly decline. We have newer and better technologies that just need some time to mature. Julia and Apples Swift come to mind. Both of these are too immature at the moment but offer significant advantages over Python long term. 
Yes that’s what I meant in terms of the package. If I have more than one script but they work together because I’m importing other parts of the other script I’d need to use the _\_init_\_.py
I suspect that you are trying to insult Matlab users here. In any case the real target for Matlab is rather talented engineers. You really need a certain level of intelligence to justify the use of Matlab in the first place. As to language quirks, every language has them, no surprise there. 
Are you making a package, or are you just storing a bunch of scripts in a directory? /r/learnpython and read the sidebar.
You can use it; you don't need it. As long as the directory is in the python interpreter's search path you can import the other modules directly.
I’m learning python so I should of posted this there but what exactly is the difference between a package or a directory? If I have all my scripts inside of a single folder with the __ init__.py file located in that same folder is that folder a package or directory or neither? The script I have is creating a block in one file then I’m importing that block into a new script named blockchain. Everything works as long as I add the __ init__.py file inside the folder of the project I’m working on so I’m wondering why do I need to add that __ init__.py file to make it work?
This actually makes perfect sense
**Yes!** We Pythonistas must be doing something right for them to start the FUD.
Yeah, I get that. Hell, one project I'm currently working on has me calling some ancient Fortran routines that haven't been updated because there's no need to devote time and money to porting something known to be correct and efficient into a more modern form. Bringing Python to my workplace was more about people that are using Matlab as a $2000 graphing calculator and occasionally writing a loop, not forcing a rewrite of entire engineering support systems.
Take a look at this tutorial by sentdex. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwH0HvMI4EA
I just asked this above but what exactly is a directory vs a package. Is the directory where the files are located like a folder?
More like half a byte over
print('congrats') **or** print 'congrats'?
from __future__ import print_function print ('congrats') Obviously.
Isn’t legacy software at once beautiful but also perplexing At some point there will be nobody to support that FORTRAN code yet it will still be used. This even happens in more mainstream business code with COBOL being a good example. It will be used up until an issue is found and then huge meetings will be dedicated to addressing the legacy code. Months after those meetings a junior programmer will be saddled with coming up with a new solution programmed in the latest “hot” language. The thought just popped into mind here that we have a similar situation in the Windows ecosystem where old Visual Basic apps refuse to be updated and end up only being addressed when so Windows glitch makes the unusable.

I actually like MATLAB, but this script highlights its flaws. The editor issues an annoying warning whenever you have an assignment with unsuppressed output (it prints the result unless terminated with a semicolon, not a bad feature, but not really an advantage over Python either). Defining the '*' operator for inner and outer products instead of JUST multiplication is an endless source of bugs. It is nice have matrices as part of the language syntax though, and the monolithic library structure fits a lot of scientific workflows well. And indexing by natural numbers is elegant and brave.
I think I understand a bit better now, import threading def dot_printer(stop): while not stop: print('.',end='', flush=True) stop = False waiting= threading.Thread(target=dot_printer, args=(stop,)) waiting.start() Mainfunc() # Thing you are waiting for stop = True waiting.join() Still on phone so this isn't perfect 
0.73 Why?
&gt; Classes should be handled with getters and setters This is /r/python, not /r/java. Getters and setters should not be created for public instance attributes, you just access them directly. `foo.bar` over `foo.get_bar()`.
This happened to me once. It was awful - I spent days debugging without finding what was happening. This is why I now have the habbit of using ii, jj...as dummy index variables instead of i, j... Matlab was also the first language I coded in. It's indexed at 1 - which I thought was normal. I spent hours debugging a simple loop in another language until I finally realized that almost every decent language starts at 0 not at 1.
3M is coming!
I still use octave or freemat for little one-off calculations and plots
Nice start, how does it handle not generating two exactly the same tweets, ie when the weather is not varying much. I know it threw mine out until i added a random string to each tweet.
A directory is a folder. It can contain files and other folders. A package is a directory that contains an \_\_init\_\_.py file. Python cannot import a directory, but it can import a package. When you do `import package`, the interpreter runs the \_\_init\_\_.py file and assigns the resulting module to the name `package`.
I see, makes so much more sense now thank you!

That I know but it is still OOP it is a good practice to be able to handle the encapsulation well. The OOP must be programmed in an orderly manner and with good practices that can be learned over time

They are charging the universities quite a lot but in turn they give a "campus license" so it looks like free.
What I like is this README, keep up with that because even you will forget how to run this after a few months, trust me. Also I love the fact that you had a problem and you solved it with code and python is a great match for this problem. Regarding the code I didn't go through each line on the first glance I noticed something so I have a suggestion. In `Outlook.__init__` method there is self.config = configparser.ConfigParser() self.config.read('../config/config.ini') This ties your `Outlook` class with this particular file structure (relative path) and particular file on the disk. Makes your code hard to test because of the strict structure also you would need to alter the file in order to test multiple configurations. Overall makes `Outlook` class dependent on that particular file which isn't good. Maybe you change your mind in future and start using a different method to get your configurations (from env or vault). `Outlook` shouldn't care about that. My suggestion is to pass variables via `init` parameters instead of reading the arbitrary file in `init` itself. Even passing configuration as a parameter would be better (if you use too many variables) since then it can be mocked during the testing phase. Read about dependency injection. One more minor thing, [use `snake_case` instead of `camelCase`](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#function-and-variable-names). __totalMessages --&gt; __total_messages Hope this helps. :)
The syntax and such are the same, you were just using an api for Minecraft. You might use functions from an api in many python projects. So, you code python. The fact that it was Minecraft doesn’t matter :) but now maybe you’ll do more things outside of Minecraft but have a decent base to work off of.

I feel like "encapsulation" is one of those words that programmers just throw around from time to time without actually understanding what it actually means. There is no risk to encapsulation by letting calling code use public attributes directly in Python. You always have full control over your public API because if something changes and you need to control access to a public attribute, you can just use a property.
Thank you so much for the feedback and advice! I really do appreciate it!
Do they not have scoping?
The control always got it if you are ordered but the getter and the setter is a way to keep ordered is almost the same as direct access to the attribute. Keep in mind that if you are just entering the world of OOP should have good practices for the sake of your code, then do what you want if you want to use getters and setters or if you want the attributes directly, but the important thing is that he learn the part of encapsulation. I hope it is understood that it is a way of being ordered and having good practices, nothing more
as far as i know Matlab has been the most dreadful programming language 
Interesting post! I'm a relatively experienced MATLAB user and want to switch to Python. Do you have any reference in my mid that can help me with that? Thanks a bunch! PS: I mostly do numerical analysis work. Maybe a reference in that direction would be better.
There are actually plenty of material if you search them together. Though some misleading as the one I have mentioned in the OP. My workshop will be somewhere in the late January and I will surly publish it openly and will share links here if you wish. 
Oh, this is my jam! I work on a NLP compiler in my day job. (I teach the computer to read English and turn it into computer logic). A chatbot is a pretty intensive project. I would argue that any form of open ended chatbot (ie, not just a while loops and if-thens) is a project for an Experienced Coder™. However, don't let that stop you from learning about it. Here's a few of the central concepts: * Natural Language Processing (use NLTK, start here: [NLTK Book](https://www.nltk.org/book/)) * Generative Text (I suggest [Pytracery](https://github.com/aparrish/pytracery)) * Knowledge-based AI (I don't have any good references) You could also look into an online course in AI, like [edX Introduction to Artificial Intelligence](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-artificial-intelligence-1), which claims it's for beginners.
Too bad two communities can’t be mutually successful...
That would be awesome. I really appreciate you sharing your handouts. I live in Switzerland. Where's your workshop going to be? I have searched a bit but haven't seen any simple to understand document like MATLAB help documentation. In fact I'm not a very good programmer so I used MATLAB merely for its great help. 
It will be at University of Twente, Netherlands. 
This is exactly the licensing model that made a PhD research lab I know of drop MATLAB entirely in 2010.
Learn how to work on a branch. Isolate your code and environment. If you can't repro a bug you can't fix it. Assume that the client is not going to give good feedback. All that you will hear likely are complaints. 
It's not the place for your post. Please, place it on r/learnpython 
To be fair, it is insanity that the dot-T on a vector in numpy does not produce a column vector. Really bad legacy design. The Matlab way is also how the matrix multiply operation works, so it is the correct design to have it act that way if you believe that you can use the datatype with matrix algebra. Which most do when they see numpy. The main problem is that they are not using the @-operation, but since not many people know about it, it is a bad idea to use it. In addition, it makes code look absolutely horrible. It is a shame numpy came with the multiply operation having the wrong meaning; its legacy is bad for future adaptation and good for Matlab sales. So it is fair to show those legacy problems. I haven't loaded Matlab for many years now because I managed to get away from it quickly (my main computations are in c++, where Eigen is king for easy to write-and-read code, so all I needed was plotting and basic statistics). I remember Matlab being very fast though, so it would not surprise me if it is indeed faster than numpy. But it should require the code. And they need to compare both cold start and repeated usage of the code.
It's not enough to teach good practices of OOP. You need to teach good practices of the language Getters and setters are a good OOP practice but a **bad** practice of Python. They add complexity to your code while being completely unnecessary for the language. For example, look at this simple class I created in Python, with added getters and setters: class Point: def __init__(self): self._x = 0 self._y = 0 self._z = 0 def get_x(self): return self._x def set_x(self, x): self._x = x def get_y(self): return self._y def set_y(self, y): self._y = y def get_z(self): return self._z def set_z(self, z): self._z = z The class only has three attributes but it's grown into a monstrosity because I had to add getters and setters. But the kicker is that it's completely unnecessary. **This is not good Python practice.**
Just finished python translator that can be used from command line. Yes there are tons of them out there but I tried to make things as simple as possible in this one plus this is my first project that can be acquired by pip command :) Here is the link if you want to check it out: [https://github.com/Raptr3x/python-translator](https://github.com/Raptr3x/python-translator)
You mean like Python? $ cat test.py def foo(): print(i) for i in range(2): foo() $ python3 test.py 0 1 
How can they have a fraction of a subscriber? Why are they even using floats?!
\`\*\` is not NumPy choice for elementwise multiplication. It is enforced by Python's design and heavily influenced by the necessities of broadcasting. \`@\` and \`\_\_matmul\_\_\` are also not NumPy but Python. All other symbols are taken and this is the least intrusive compared to others (you can read [the PEP](https://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0465/) for more context). Also it is pretty recent (Python 3.5) hence people now starting to know. 1D arrays are as the name implies 1D. Hence transposing them is a noop. 1D becoming 2D is adding dimensions. Entering 2D is indeed annoying but if you develop a sense of muscle memory np.atleast\_2d in a bit better.
Minecraft is turing complete. Why switch over?
I think the example already stated is sufficient. If a package rarely uses numpy (an expensive load in terms of resources), then importing only when a particular def needs it would be an understandable choice to make. Rare, but understandable
He wasn't calling Matlab users idiots; he was suggesting that they are more mathematicians and engineers than they are computer scientists, and might not be expected to know every possible subtle 'gotcha' of programming languages.
That may very well be the case but it isn’t how I read it. Frankly the post stinks like it was posted by a programmer with a superiority complex that has no respect for the education and talents of others. Now that may not be the original posters intent but he certainly didnt consider how others will take the post. I often see this attitude that programming and tech are one and the same and anybody involved in other pursuits is an imbecile. 
I love SIMULINK, great tool. However I have since moved away from MATLAB to python, python is just so much better in so many different ways. I’ll have to check these out!
I see what you did there
Try OpenModelica and JModelica implementations of the Modelica language
Well, rest assured, I definitely just meant that the target audience is people who won't account for gotchas like overriding the imaginary unit by using it as a loop variable. Which is a stupid oversight considering that both i and j (ijk) are standard loop variables. 
Probably have more if asshats weren't super perculiar about what topics are allowed to be discussed. 
range(1, 5) includes first and excludes second i.e. 1 2 3 4. So it's same as list slicing.
It's considered idiomatic for slicing a collection to be inclusive start and exclusive end. This is due to the ubiquity of 0-based indexing in computer science, and we also have `range` reflect this for consistency. (Compare this with a C-style loop for the first N elements `for(int i = 0; i &lt; N; i++) {`) The `random.randint` is an exception because there is the function `random.randrange`, which is the same as selecting a random element from a range.
Go down to the search bar and type it in. Easiest way in my opinion.
The OP's point is that \`randint\` is inclusive of both start and end, while list slicing and range are inclusive of the start and exclusive of the end. The philosophy on slicing is that the start-inclusive-end-exclusive allows you to write: a = some\_list\[0:4\] b = some\_list\[4:8\] c = some\_list\[8:\] and get non-overlapping slices. I believe \`randint\` was written as a convenience short-cut for \`random()\*(end-start) + start\` which would normally be start-inclusive-end-exclusive (since random() return 0 inclusive to 1 exclusive), but in the interests of being convenient, was made end-inclusive. So that beginners can write \`die\_roll = randint(1, 6)\` and get the expected random value from 1-6 inclusive.
You are right but it is difficult to do everything at the same time to learn good practices of OOP to be able to work in any OOP language and to have good practices in Python, it is not easy to learn.
I tried that, but it didn't work. I made an edit explaining what I did. Thank you for your quick reply.
Did you try doing it?
This was a test I failed. I literally have no idea how to code, and the only reason I’m in this course is because my college just through me in it. 
print(f"The sum of all numbers from 1 to {k} is {sum(range(k+1))}.")
Use a for loop up to k. In each loop, add the values to a sum variable. 
Just use [Rpy2](https://rpy2.readthedocs.io/en/version_2.8.x/overview.html)?

Like u/fuuman1 showed, there is no need for a loop.. 
I just started learn programming but I think this code should work: sum\_ = 0 k = int(input("k:")) for i in range(1,k + 1): sum\_ += i print("The answer is:",sum\_)

Damnit you beat me
I don't think I was clear in conveying my point. Requiring the user to use supply a string as part of the public facing part of an API can cause issues further on ahead, regardless of whether or not experience has shown that the value changes infrequently. Also, is it "debug" or "DEBUG" as in the example, that to me, says that I need to understand what is going on under the hood to get the right value. Supplying commonly used values, as under well known names like loguru.DEBUG makes the implementation of your API more flexible if you choose to decide to change value to mean something else do to some other implementation or requirement. As soon as you have your consumers use a user side created constant, some control is lost.
Thanks for the suggestions. I actually did face issues while testing. I have mentioned it in the issued tab as well. I'll keep that in mind. Thank you. 
Indeed. The standard solution to parsing is to use a parser such as [PLY](https://www.dabeaz.com/ply/).
The traditional way to do this would be to increment a temporary sum variable def sum_up_to_num(num): sum= 0 for i in range(1, num): sum+=i return sum Other have suggested the sum method because you won't understand how it really works underneath if you just learn some method name 
I think that's why mine isn't working. I just sat down to look at it again, but with logging error code this time and it's saying duplicate. I'm going to find a way to navigate that now.

Reversed the packets and are doing MitM?
If your `@property` is just a return and your `setter` is just an assignment, you should use neither. Read and write to the class variable directly. This isn't Java. The way Python properties work is you can replace the internal variable with a _my_var and `@property` and `@my_var.setter` at any time. Don't make these unless you need them.

Input will return a string, not a number. You need to use `int(input(...))` if you want to a whole number or `float(input(...))` if you want to accept decimals.
Yes! It's a fucking shit do boring for's for something than can be [solved in one step](http://mathcentral.uregina.ca/qq/database/qq.02.06/jo1.html) Many times a classroom is like tearing your brain off doing stupid repetitive things. I'll hope that you can rediscover python outside of a classroom because can be very funny. The same kind of fun like doing math or take LSD in a modern art gallery (I'll recommend you both too, but study fist ;-).
I would recommend looking at [this article](https://medium.com/@umerfarooq_26378/tools-to-run-python-on-android-9060663972b4), [this article](https://www.pycon.it/conference/talks/developing-android-apps-completely-in-python), or [this article.](https://www.androidauthority.com/an-introduction-to-python-on-android-759685/). I hope you find these helpful!
Thank you very much. I'll take a look at them right now.
oh shit. this makes sense, thanks!
Thousands of lines? That's what like a day?
thats great. i was obviously wrong so the correction and your explanation make total sense now. cheers man
&gt; `*` is not NumPy choice for elementwise multiplication. It is enforced by Python's design and heavily influenced by the necessities of broadcasting. No, base Python doesn't support elementwise multiplication. &gt; `@` and `__matmul__` are also not NumPy but Python. No. It was proposed for Python with heavy input from the numpy/scipy/pandas developers. In fact, you might as well say they wrote it. Base Python does nothing with matmult / @. It's a numpy and scipy feature.
You can code all your live in haskell without see a `for` but your are doing loops. u/fuuman1 solution is O(n), but `print(f"he sum of all numbers from 1 to {k} is {int(k*(k+1)/2)}")` is O(1). Fibonacci numbers can be solved in O(1) too via Binet's formula, without hiding loops with fancy functional programming style ;-)
How about python to code iOS apps?
I dont see the point of your answer. He asked in python, not haskell, not asm, not c, neither pascal nor b or a. He said: Python. the answer provided by u/fuuman1 clearley solved his question, in Python, without the need of a loop. So, despite all your knowledge on the subject, the answer you provided is superfluous. ;) 
Thanks for understanding! At my point in life, this course is the least of my worries (on track for a business degree) maybe when I have the time I will pick back up on it! I’ll tell you if I ever trip and go to an art gallery tho 🤘🏻
Yes dev is still stressful, but nowhere near as stressful as running it ops or service desk. Be it managing or being a team member. Don't forget in large corporations you have the "business analysts" as buffers between the general Corp population and the devs. It ops and service desks are pretty much front line. Management for it ops, and the entire Corp for service desks. And in my experience often there is no difference in stress levels caused between the two.

You install python on the computer, but you install the python extension in VSCode, so you should correct the title.
After building apps with Android Studio and Java, I'm now starting to learn how to build apps with Kivy, the python library and I recommend it highly. Though, you'll need Linux or Mac to build the actual APK.
sum python's function hides a loop. So there a loop and execution order is O(n) (as all things that have a loop). Talking about haskell is an analogy to show that not see a `for` is not the same that a loop does not exists. You can do loops with `while`, recursive functions,... and so on. I was explaining you because you were downvoted without an explanation. But you're free to believe in a world with less loops that real ones.
Thank you very much sir. You have just provided the answer for a question no one asked. It was a pleasure. Have a good day. 
Go ahead and Google it, I don't think people here would condone and support you wanting to cheat. It's a morally crappy thing to do and takes the fun away from other people. As a side note, their anti-cheat detection is pretty good so there's a good chance you would be banned at some point and forever unable to play the game. The engine looks for programs like AHK to detect cheating. Even if you were to buy a cheating program from a software developer, he basically needs to rewrite or update the code every month because they have a whole team that looks into cheating mechanisms and scripts.

I made the switch a few years ago and have been super happy about it. There are a few extremely minor things I miss but I love python so much more. Convincing others to switch has been hard tough. They have so much baggage that they can’t take the time to invest in learning python. And I mean like 20+ year old functions. I’m going to keep working on converting them but it’s slow!

Great work. I did [something similiar](https://github.com/eitchtee/Spotilyrics) some time ago, when Spotify removed the lyrics button from the desktop app, but I relied on a hacky way of retrieving the songs on Windows, and it no longer works. Props for using the API, wished it existed back when I made my project.

I think that python is so flexible that it can be used very poorly like Matlab or like it’s supposed to be used. Be weary of any `from ________ import *` I really like [SciPy Lecture Notes](https://www.scipy-lectures.org/) as a good guide for doing the same *type* of stuff!
For real though it would be absolutely amazing if they made a frontend python language. Chrome devs need to make this happen stat. &lt;script type="webpython"&gt; if 'name' in URI.params: for element in DOM.body.find('h5'): element.text = 'Hello, {}'.format(URI.params['name']) &lt;/script&gt;

I was working on challenge 2 last night, did you have trouble with that one too? I definitely did. 
bleach is a great package for this as well.
My issue with the front end isn’t with JavaScript — syntactically it’s not that different from Python; it’s with HTML and CSS and how that interacts with JS.
Django and Flask I guess. That's what in about to dive into after my final project is done.

I looked but did not see a way to exit the program on a logging level--such as having critical failures exit immediately. Like a [ShutdownHandler.](https://gist.github.com/gothma/2459959b58b8af895574) Did I miss that? &amp;#x200B;
Seconded for Raspberri pi. Great little 30 dollar device. 
/r/learnpython is a good start, as the sidebar of this sub would also tell you.
The benchmarks are probably true when you compare pure python to matlab. But the several order of magnitude differences disappear when you do an apples-to-apples comparison; that is: * vectorized operations in both with numpy/scipy; * use [numba as a JIT](https://numba.pydata.org/numba-doc/latest/user/5minguide.html) like how MATLAB has JIT built in for many operations; * parallelize your computation equally (multi-core or with a GPU) The people developing matlab aren't the same people marketing it. Further, the people who make decisions to buy licenses for software like matlab often aren't computer experts, or intrinsically think if they pay hundreds of thousands for something that it must be better than the free stuff.
Is there an issue bud?
You need to post this in r/learnpython But to answer your question (if I understand you currently) then yes, it is possible.

But... 300000 = 1001001001111100000_2 and 300131 = 1001001010001100011_2 so actually we are not even a bit over 300000. :( This joke brought to you by `bin`.
Not sure if the articles /u/duineAduain provided go into this, but I think the best bet would be PWAs. 
Actually... we'd still have 130 to spare.
If you have 2 years of Java, any resource to learn the syntax will be enough to get out up and running
I did not know that such a handler existed! Not sure that using logger for control-flow is ideal, but this is possible using a custom sink like `def sink(m): print(m, file=sys.stderr); sys.exit(1)`.
So, I don't actually like Matlab but I did work at Mathworks for some time developing their Robot Systems Toolbox. My team was awesome and the product was surprisingly good. That said, there were some things about the corporation on the whole that kind of bothered me and perhaps what bothered me most was their attitude towards python. It was treated as a threatening competitor (especially jupyter since more of their customers were gravitating towards the literate programming style it allowed). This said, I've done benchmarks myself as well as seen a bunch of other benchmarks. If we're talking raw speed for common mathematical operations on arrays/matrices, Matlab will pretty much always win out against python. Their algorithms are extremely optimized for specific architectures. over course of more than a decade, the same isn't quite true for Numpy (unless maybe if you compiled Numpy yourself for specific architectures, but that kind of defeats the purpose yes?). Their interpreter is JIT compiled so pure cpython can't come close to Matlab when you're writing loops. Pypy and Julia get close but not quite (at least in all my tests from like 3 years ago, things may be different now). TL;DR: Matlab folk see python as competition but in most of the use cases they are targeting their code likely runs faster than equivalent python.
There's actually a pretty impressive python wrapper for most video games, `import gitgud`
That’ll work. Yeah, assigning the level ‘critical’ to be a bail-out mechanism isn’t an ideal scenario, but it often pops up in command-line tools that get stitched together.

In this case, the good practice is "don't use getters and setters". It's easier for a beginner to design their class like below: class Point: def __init__(self): self.x = 0 self.y = 0 self.z = 0 than it is to design a class with getters and setters.
Did you even click the PEP link I've sent you? Does it have any NumPy in it? 
Sure it is. It's quite easy to change the meaning of the multiply operator, and they choose to have this as elementwise. From a mathematical clarity point of view, this was a bad decision. It is now a legacy that has to stick around. And they are not called 1D array to the world. They are simply called array. Clarity is the most important property, because a numerical code has to be read by folks that either have never programmed before, or are used to the common Matlab-Fortran combination. Look, none of this matters. My personal experience teaching students is that they complain about the above patterns. You will not believe me, so have a nice day
Look about the Kivy framework.

Well actually what the browser is showing: "&lt;FirstName&gt;Mar/FirstName&gt;" &amp;#x200B; Looks **exactly** what you would expect if some encoding fuckup was going on, eating one or mor chars from the string and the '&lt;', which are combined in a funky unicode codepoint represented with a ''. What the chars are and which encoding they are in I cannot say (though I'd bet on Mariù&lt;/FirstName&gt;) but looking at them with a binary editosr should clear it. &amp;#x200B;

I used WXpython and Kivy for several projects and those are some solid options. I also heard some good things about PyQT. And if you want I guess OpenGL is always a possibility (mainly it you want want to learn, but optimizing may be hard)
I'm working on learning Python
print(sum(list(range(k+1)))
Hey! Don't talk about Spyder like that. Once code folding is implemented it's gonna be a great IDE
pyInstaller is not always the solution. It really depends how complex is its installation requirements and how much flexibility OP wants. Sometimes it pays off to instead create a virtualenv, install the application there with an appropriate entry point, then have the right startup script that starts the env and runs the entry point.
His answer is actually pretty awesome. Despite not explicitly using a for loop, fuumans answer is still performing loops under the hood while lazios answer tackles the problem mathematically and saves you k loops and instead does it in constant time.
I believe this to be very subjective depending on your needs. For most of my GUI development, I use Kivy. It's a great framework for crossplatform development using python. Kivy has an excellent styling language "kvlang" which makes front end development super easy. As well as having very nice documentation. If crossplatform isnt an issue for you, I'd recommend Kivy still as it's so nice to use. But I've had success with Tkinter in the passed, though it's not nearly as nice as Kivy.
Concerning that performance comparison image, did they publish the code they used to make the comparison and did they say what versions of python and numpy they used?
Whats the name of your tool? We cant help you without that.
Not at all. I haven't seen any at least.

Mentioning the GUI library you're using might help ... Also the type of project you have? If it's a game there's a much higher minimum standard required for UI graphics than a to-do note app. Without knowing what it is, all you're going to get is very general shit like "you can probably style the widgets with CSS" or "You can use Kivy if you don't want to use default widgets".
Cue in Hans Zimmerman music when entering passwords... or use modern GUI library, like Qt5. 
Fixed. Thank you :D
In my experience octave is more optimized than matlab in some areas. I had to process this large csv and matlab would straight out hang while octave would go through the file like a champ. But this was before I started using python.
If you are using tkinter... I can understand. That's the reason I actually got frustrated and almost drop python. But then I found Pyside2 and now I love the GUIs I create with it. It's a bit tricky, so I don't know if that fits into your **"without getting into too complicated"** but it's worth a try. The best part is that you create most of the GUI with Qt Designer, instead of using code. 
Hi StephanKash, Were all rookies to this, and i expect you want to know what program i'm writing in? Were using Spyder to write. &amp;#x200B;
Hi Sorlafloat, &amp;#x200B; I believe the right answer for your question is "Tkinter"?
I see... so i guess Tkinter is just boring as it is? We can't swap to anything else than what we got, as we don't want it to get too complicated exactly. I guess I'll have to live with a boring result. thanks tho! 
This would be crazy. 
There is a few things that you can do to improve Tkinter GUIs but sooner or later you'll find yourself limited without a way to add a "modern" feel to your programs.
If it's about improving then why not just help improving the ZAP, it's open source. I think that would be better then reinventing the wheel.
In Python you are right but in OOP no
You have Zap and Burp, nmap, metasploit, and manual testing... what more do you need? :)
Cheers for the help buddy, have a good one! :)
Personally I am anxious for the plot/figure interface they are implementing in spyder 4, this will make dealing with dozens or even hundreds of plots a lot easier.
hold the letter e until all other letters are gone
I honestly have no idea why there is so much discussion about speed in Python and Matlab. Neither are particularly well suited for efficiency, and that's not why people use them. So what's the point anyway?
Again, this is fine OOP practice for Python. You need to get this idea out of your head that getters and setters are the only way to do OOP correctly.
