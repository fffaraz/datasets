Trick 6:- "5 Surprising Tricks About Python You Need to Implement Today" != "Anything new at all, it's just bog standard, idiomatic Python"
Yeah, Flask and Bottle are both pretty nice minimal tools, as is CherryPy. And while I do adore Django, I think this is a case where Django is overkill, and too much to take in and learn, while the others leave too little said in the documentation and what they provide to begin with to give a good start. 
If you haven't yet read the article, it's just some low hanging fruit about how developing is a constant learning experience.

I'll try it on an ui I'm building here at AIBS. Will let you know the user reaction 
Indeed I am using pythong 2.7. But not only the print statement. The way it was saved inside the databse too. Neverthless, what are you suggesting? Tha k you for your help. Totally blacked out on unicode and python 2
I'm not sure what I'm looking at. Some explanation would help, what exactly is the goal of this bot? Source code would be even better. 
The default single user install folder is as the OP has shown several times, i.e. C:\Users\blackbelt21\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python37 for 64 bit python, append -32 on the end for 32 bit. The default for "install for all users" is c:\program files\python37 for 64 bit python, c:\program files (x86)\python 37 for 32 bit.
You define a bunch of functions (even re-defining `displayIntro()` at one point), without calling any of them. Also, your indentation is quite original. 
Which "end text" does it display exactly? Got any screenshot of your game running?
I'm not sure I understand excatly, but do I need to full the brackets after def choosedoor (door)? Is the originality okay?
The end will read the line "It is an empty room with a few tatteted..." then skip to "Do you want to play again? (Yes or no)" without allowing the player to have the second selection appear. 
&gt; Is the originality okay? As is, your script just fails in my Python interpreter because it complains about the indentation. --- As for the calling functions thing, a code block as follows defines a function in Python: def say_hello(name): print('Hello, ' + name + '!') To actually use this function, you have to put a line like the following in your code. This will execute the code you defined in your function. say_hello('Johnny') In your code, you define a bunch of functions but never call them. This means that the code inside those functions never gets carried out.
Okay, thank you. I appreciate the insight.
So far, a lot of the errors have just been indentation based. I commented wherever I changed something, I'm still working on it though. Are you using python 3 or 2.7? import random import time # aligned defs with each other def displayIntro(): print('''There are two doors, one to your left and one to your right. The left door is numbered 1 and the right door is numbered 2''') def chooseDoor(): door = '' while door != 1 and door != 2: print('Which door do you go through? (1 or 2)') door = input() return door def checkDoor(chosenDoor): print('You approach the door...') time.sleep(2) print('You reach for the knob...') time.sleep(2) print('Turn and push the door open and step into the dark room...') print() time.sleep(2) friendlyDoor = random.randint(1, 2) if chosenDoor == str(friendlyDoor): print('A trap! Swinging axes from all sides of the room rush at you. You are now dead') else: # Tabs ::) print('It is an empty room with a few tattered banners hanging and candles melted') print('to a small pile.') def displayIntro(): print('''There is a hall with a large bloody streak scaling the length of the pass and the second hall has a worn sign stating "Beware of Monster beyond this sign" Suddenly! The door behind you slams shut with a "BANG" and the room darkens''') def chooseHall(): hall = '' while hall != 1 and hall != 2: print('Which hall do you choose? (1-Bloody or 2-Beware?)') hall = input() return hall def checkHall(chosenHall): print('You walk towards the hall...') time.sleep(2) print('Sliding your hand along the wall for guidence...') time.sleep(2) print('Reaching the end of the dark, damp hall when suddenly...') print() time.sleep(2) friendlyHall = random.randint(1, 2) if chosenHall == str(friendlyHall): print('Suddenly the floor beneath your feet vanishes and you begin a freefall until an untimely spiked death') else: print('Following the wall, you find your self entering a room stretching further than you can see.') print('The room is lined with cells and cages for beasts and man alike.') time.sleep(2) print('From beyond the dark, you hear a low and deep snarl making your soul tremble...') time.sleep(2) print('....') # This is python's main statement, where you define where the main # section of code of located. This is executed first. if __name__ == "__main__": # Formatting and tabs are critical with python playAgain = 'yes' while playAgain == 'yes' or playAgain == 'y': displayIntro() doorNumber = chooseDoor() checkDoor(doorNumber) print('Do you want to play again? (yes or no)') # force input into a string playAgain = str(input())
What throwaway_the_fourth said. You don't call any of your functions. It checks if "chosenDoor" is a string, but there is nothing in ChosenDoor so it defaults to that text. Am on mobile and at work so can't really help out further ATM.

http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#comments &gt; Block comments generally apply to some (or all) code that follows them, and are indented to the same level as that code. Each line of a block comment starts with a # and a single space (unless it is indented text inside the comment). Don't fight PEP8. 
I do think this is a good article for beginners to read. If you think you just need to learn enough so you can stop feeling so frustrated, you’re gonna have a bad time. If you relish the frustration because it’s so worth it for the rush you get when your code works, then you’ve found the right field.
Instead of using the loads() method to parse the file line by line you should try the load() method with the file pointer. (see https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/json.html) Accumulating the data after that should be left to you as an exercise. 
Definitely pycharm from Jetbrains, there is a free community edition ctrl + alt + L to instantly make the whole script PEP 8 regardless of where you have put your comments or comment tags
Wow, I have never used tkinter but I have to say now that I checked the module documentation, it's one of the worst I've ever seen. I found this though that might be useful, but may contain some outdated info too (hopefully not much): http://infohost.nmt.edu/tcc/help/pubs/tkinter/web/menu.html Basically add `tearoff=False` when creating the menu: &gt; menu = Menu(master, tearoff=False) Next time: &gt; If you are about to ask a question, please consider r/learnpython 
If only there was a simple windows gui for this.
The fine folks over at /r/learnpython can help you out
!solved
Side note, tkinter is merely what pycharm ships with, is there a better gui to use?
Thanks I just did a quick python search this came up first
I tried pycharm before but could never get it to work right. I use a SP4 and whenever I connected to my external monitor... it went to shit (Everything super tiny). 
So basically: class Dot(dict): __getattr__ = dict.get __setattr__ = dict.__setitem__ __delattr__ = dict.__delitem__ Am I right?
First of all, [learn what json is](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON#Data_types.2C_syntax_and_example). Now think about what your code is trying to do when you go line-by-line through the json file like that. You're trying to parse each line as its own json object, but each line isn't its own json object. Line 2, for example, ` "all": {` is not valid json syntax by itself. "all" is the first attribute within the root object (`{`) that begins on line 1 and contains all those categories within it. The whole file can be treated as one json object: import json with open('OverwatchItemsList.json') as f: data = json.load(f) # not loads()! # load() takes a file, loads() takes a string You mentioned you want to see the number of trues under each category. Now your sprays are going to be in `data['all']['sprays']`. It'll be a `dict`, so if you want to count a particular value, `data['all']['sprays'].values().count(True)`. Lastly, try /r/learnpython for questions like this in the future. We're generally more of a self-help subreddit (as in "help yourself to the manual").
If the GUI is something simple, I'd stick with tkinter. Nowadays the general recommendation is to use Qt via PyQt or PySide. You could use QtDesigner to design the GUI, [see here](http://pythonforengineers.com/your-first-gui-app-with-python-and-pyqt/). In some cases a HTML/JS GUI is enough but can overcomplicate things. I have some legacy applications that use wxPython but plan to migrate them to something else in the future (its development slow down a lot). If you decide to use it, I'd recommend checking wxFormBuilder to design the forms. 
Thanks again for the links apologies for a noob question I thought it was easier than anticipated but I appreciate the help.
You can also make use of c9.io. which is way more established than glitch.com. ofc its not easy to find projects in c9.io than glitch but i guess github does the job for now &gt;_&gt;
Thanks for the help
vscode sublime text editor atom bracket visual studio these are some nice editors for coding
n = 15 declares n as an int, wheres the lesson wants you to convert it into a string for output.
I can't figure it out either. I couldn't find any posts on the first couple of pages with those titles.
thank you hooliews i have a subreddit called the codings can see it? www.reddit.com/r/Codings
no
Look into the esp8266 chip. It can run micropython.
Assuming it has that structure, you can find the p and then use `parent`.
Nice, that works. Thank you, internet stranger.
It is, but it's definitely a message beginners need to hear constantly. If you're an expert at *anything*, you know the grind necessary. But for a beginner, they don't know the grind never stops. As we move into trying to teach children CS concepts, it's something to keep in our minds as well (as Carol Dweck has conducted research on the hazards of negative instructors in student's performance). Kids naturally struggle with the littlest of details; I've seen 10 years old struggle to hook up an Arduino to a breadboard. There is the reaffirmation that is needed to keep trying. For experts, yes, low hanging fruit; but for beginners or experts in a mentoring role, it's a great piece of advice to remind us of.
Cool to see his on Reddit because I was at the talk! It was really interesting seeing a general overview of the challenges that Ned faced in developing a program to draw complex geometrical patterns. One of the best programming talks I’ve seen to date. 
&gt; Thanks, I will keep it in mind and reconsider. It would be more like javascript. Making Python *more* like JavaScript is a bad idea.
I realized I wasn't a beginner anymore when it became OK for me to be a completely clueless with every new problem I had to tackle, and the anxiety I had about the cluelessness disappeared.
In my job I have to either manually take readings from a computer display or type them into a document. The logic is RSLogix 5000 and I can communicate to it via RSLinx and can also get live data via a small script in excel. I want to be able to automate this where I connect my laptop to the PLC set the communication path and create a log or report of this running data with the click of a button. The problem I see is that I would have to tweak this program for each customer site due to each site having different analogs that need to be recorded. Maybe grab the analogs from a csv file. Not sure if Python is the way to do this or if it can do this.

Agreed. I glanced at the article and didn't see the point of adding all of what he did. 
Yea I use a 4K monitor and the defaults are tiny, you could try going into file-settings-editor-font and change the size while pycharm is on your external and see if it saves the setting for that screen

The lesson is telling you to convert it, just to be explicit. If you give print a non-string argument, it is converted to a string. Neither way is *wrong*, but especially when learning, it is good to be explicit.
Even easier are [statistics.stdev](https://docs.python.org/3/library/statistics.html#statistics.stdev), [numpy.std](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.13.0/reference/generated/numpy.std.html) or [pandas.DataFrame.std](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.std.html).

There's [kivymd](https://gitlab.com/kivymd/KivyMD) but you'll have to learn some kivy first. It's pretty good at making something simple, but the widgets themselves can't be customized much. Defaults are fine most of the time, though.
See §5.1 of https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1341.txt. The email body most likely uses quoted-printable as a content transfer encoding. In which case it's nothing to do with your database but how you're parsing the email.
OPs post quality has not improved at all. Same problems as his first post on /r/python: * Erroneously formated code, which makes his examples completely useless * Trivial, low effort themes * Reinventing the wheel instead of using the stdlib Please OP, try to improve or your "articles" will remain low effort click bait.
I doubt you have NO python on your mac, pretty sure Mac OS comes with python 2.x something. Sounds like you need to get a handle on virtualenvs , it's really not complicated. It's just separate folders for storing a python version and the libraries you want for different setups/projects. I'm a relative newb, but I suggest maybe doing this: Download / install python 3.6.2 or whatever is the latest Pick a directory where you want to store your various python virtual environments, ie: mkdir /Users/username/.pythonenvs/ run the 'virtualenv' command and make a new environment: virtualenv /Users/username/.pythonenvs/blah -p /usr/local/bin/python3 Now you have python 3, and a virtualenv directory to mess around with, install dependencies into, and delete if you want without messing anything up on your host system. Just type: source /Users/username/.pythonenvs/blah/bin/activate to enter the virtualenv , run pip, run python3, whatever. The type deactivate to get out of it. 
Wow that is most likely the cause. Debugging this beast is cumbersome. It would have been hard to trace the cause if it wasnt for your reply. I thought it was that the database have an encoding problem etc. Not for once thought about the parsing lol. I will recheck the parsing as soon as possible and reply back of my finding.... cheers !
On a second note, you are absolutely right about quoted-printable. Your comment gave me an "aha" moment. Check this screenshot i just took while trying to replicate the equal sign , Printable quoted https://imgur.com/gallery/2yaWF

Always google the documentation of the module first. [PyWin32 Documentation](http://timgolden.me.uk/pywin32-docs/) [pyHook API Documentation](http://pyhook.sourceforge.net/doc_1.5.0/) [pyHook Tutorial](https://sourceforge.net/p/pyhook/wiki/PyHook_Tutorial/) 
The alternative also happens, and it's horribly boring. When you've mastered something and it makes commercial sense to just do exactly that for the next ten customers.

How can I get started ,I want to also create my on bot on twitter,i don't know how to get started 
Oh hey, I know this guy.
I think you need to work on your algorithm. Rendered cubes are going to overlap unless you code them not to. It gets complicated in 3d with rotation and an N number of blocks. The handling of N blocks is not a problem unless you're talking 100 million blocks; just allocate enough memory (I assume GTK is similar to VTK). I'd probably use a velocity-based algorithm. Calculate the neighboring block penetration and move the blocks by some amount. They'll jiggle a bit and a few random blocks can fly away, but should work for the most part. Use something like scipy's kdtree to find all block centroids within some distance to determine the neighbors. Then calculate penetration using spherical coordinates. In regards to functions vs classes, just avoid making an object for each block. The memory and speed penalty is a waste for N blocks. This is a numpy problem to me.
I like it but I'm still inclined to think of people who call themselves "data scientists" as spreadsheet monkeys.
I'm working on a python daemon for raspberry pi that monitors my home network and stops my music when I leave my apartment, and restarts it when I come back home.
It depends what you want to get into, pick an area like data science, web development, image processing, think of a project/problem that is interesting to you. Solving a problem or chasing an idea will keep you from quitting. For engineering I would look into the data science side, tools like numpy, pandas, tensorflow, pytorch, blender, maybe even flask for developing microservices. 
If you're using anaconda, then you should use its own built-in virtual environment stuff, "conda env create" etc. Also, what do you call a "python framework". 
Thank you very much for your answer! Actually, my problem is not so much about graphical rendering; maybe my question was a little misleading. The blocks are just 2d and sit in a container. I was actually thinking I'd make each block an instance of a class, but then how would I have them manage themselves? Do I add them to a list that represents the row? How can they determine their neighbours? (I assume there will be no more than ~ 50 blocks.) Cheers!
Spreadsheet monkeys unfortunately generate billions in revenue
Not doubting their influence, only the blatant abuse of the term "science".
Well put, and I guess if it helps someone, it's already useful. 
This is a great project, I will try it out when I have some more spare time soon. Didn't get far with Gym/Universe.
Hey OP, just stop please. You always post low effort blog posts, which aren't actually useful. At this point I consider all your posts to be spam. 
You can link to it here in the comments if you want. A summary of what the bot does would also be nice. 
Write it in GTK, and use CSS for the style.

Your problem has alot of familarities with Conways Game of life. The state of a cell is determinated on the state of all the neighboring cells. So, to get the neighbors of on cell, what ever it actually is, you could use this nifty numpy functionality, using a normal list would make it a little complicated: In [1]: import numpy as np In [2]: grid = np.arange(16).reshape((4, 4)) In [3]: grid Out[3]: array([[ 0, 1, 2, 3], [ 4, 5, 6, 7], [ 8, 9, 10, 11], [12, 13, 14, 15]]) In [4]: x, y = 1, 2 In [5]: distance = 1 In [6]: grid[x-distance:x+distance+1, y-distance:y+distance+1] Out[6]: array([[ 1, 2, 3], [ 5, 6, 7], [ 9, 10, 11]]) In [7]: grid[x-distance:x+distance+1, y-distance:y+distance+1].flatten() Out[7]: array([ 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11]) In [8]: sum(grid[x-distance:x+distance+1, y-distance:y+distance+1].flatten()) - 6 Out[8]: 48 Since numpy arrays can not grow in size you would need to convert your normal list of cells into a numpy array after a cell was removed or added, but that is okay.
When I followed the steps and installed Python3.6. It seems to install 3.6.1 and not 3.6.2 . And when I try to install pip for 3.6, it says: Traceback (most recent call last): File "get-pip.py", line 20061, in &lt;module&gt; main() File "get-pip.py", line 194, in main bootstrap(tmpdir=tmpdir) File "get-pip.py", line 82, in bootstrap import pip zipimport.ZipImportError: can't decompress data; zlib not available Can anyone help?

That just makes it easier. You get to drop spherical coordinates part, pretty much everything else I'd do the same. I'd make points a (nboxs, 4, 3) numpy ndarray. So p1 is points[:,0,:]. I definitely wouldn't make a box class. You can but I think the nearest neighbor step becomes a lot harder.
At my work the sales team uses a specific CRM, it produces some PDFs (invoice, delivery form, quotations etc) but they all have the same name (invoice.pdf, delivery.pdf and so on) We made two programs, the first one converts the PDF to text and search for some texts in a specific location, according to its name (invoice.pdf for example) then rename the document with its type and the customer's code. So we go from "invoice.pdf" to "client_code - invoice - invoice_numer.pdf". Then the file is moved to a network server and a second programme, located on this server moves the file in the correct client's folder. All this withi C#. We have a configuration file used by the first program, it contains the location where to search for information and one or several regular expressions to extract the exact information we need to rename the file. 
If you can think anything cool what I should add to the module do not hold it back!
You could use regex... import re
Lol
Have you looked at automatetheboringstuff.com?
Regex are for strings. What I'm talking about(and what those two links are talking about) is matching on the various properties of arbitrary Python values. This can include matching on type, structure(the attributes of the data), or arbitrary predicates or functions of the data. You can see examples of this kind of pattern matching in languages like ML/Haskell, Scala, Racket. Yes, they are all functional programming languages(except Racket, which is multiparadigm like python), no, it isn't only useful in functional programming.
Very neat
/r/learnpython I find it hard to believe that your instructor expects you to write a matrix multiplication program without explaining what a matrix is, even if it was covered in a previous math class. If it's not in your book, check with classmates. Your instructor is final arbiter, so begging for mercy now will be in your best interest.
you and me both, but this guy told us that we are supposed to look this stuff up online ourselves. and just comment our source when writing the program using the # symbol before the comment. Also we have no book, he said everything is on free online sources. My classmates have an even worse grasp on the subject than I do. I kinda understood lists, and loop statements, but they had no idea. So this is me using free online sources, so please help. Also you didn't need to downvote just because you don't want to help.

A python install saved in Libraries/Frameworks
The issue seems to be that while I do have two unique python installs saved to my user profile for the computer - there is no general python framework installed in the usr/bin or usr/local for all user profiles. And yes I agree, it's weird because Mac OS comes with python 2.7. It seems that somehow that was removed. Thank you for the tips - will give it a shot!
are you using windows, linux, or mac? 
Thanks!
5 weeks into college and still haven't learned how to swim... by that I mean learning to learn by yourself. You need to hit this wall and climb over it without help, the longer you manage to avoid soloing it the harder it will be when it hits. Good luck.

You can either switch to python 3 or use the future import below in python 2. Strings in python 2 are byte strings, not unicode by default. from __future__ import unicode_literals You need to make sure of the encoding of the original email, make sure python is reading using unicode, and make sure your database encoding is UTF8.
Line 11 has an "if else", but no if statement precedes it. You messed up the indentation on that line. And also you want "else" not "if else" 
how would i fix it then? thanks by the way 
 if sik: .... else: .... Indentation in Python is crucial. What I wrote is different than: if sik: .... else: .... On the last example that "else" belongs inside the "if sik" and fails because there is no "if" statement that precedes it. 
It's a nice idea, I think rust's implementation might also make this more popular. Probably a lot of details to be figured out for the semantics and all the edge/error cases. The issue looking at past discussions is that it has to be a serious addition over `if/elif`, otherwise it breaks the 'one right way to do things' principle. Since `elif` covers so much ground, and python can't really use the same type-based logic of the functional languages, it's a pretty high bar for match statements...
Some general thoughts: * Using a Queue is overkill for what you are doing, look into [threading.Event](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/threading.html#threading.Event) instead. * The main problem that I see is that you aren't taking your code's execution time into account. Since you're making 2-3 DB queries to deduct the balance every second, that could easily cause your function to drift over time. E.g. You think that your loop runs for 100 1-second increments, but the actual clock time from when you started has been 104 seconds. You need to think about how to compensate for that drift.
Does a couple line demo really need to be a video?

Nice!
A very rough sketch. You have to put it on the python-ideas mailing list first. 99.99% of suggestions get shot down in flames by highly skilled Python developers, not all of whom are core developers. The 0.01% that survive end up with a PEP, but someone who wants the idea has to do the work writing the thing in the first place. Then it gets torn to pieces on the python-dev mailing list. If and only if it survives that process then the PEP gets approved by the BDFL or somebody that he has delegated to do the job. Then all that someone has to do is write the code, docs and tests, get them all peer reviewed and accepted, and lo and behold, there is your idea in the next x.y.0 version of Python. Simples :-)
I've finished 5 and I can confirm that it stops there *unless^theres^another^layer*
Yet another of the modern generation who do not bother to test anything before they post? `print` with brackets but no `from __future__ import print_function` combined with `input` and `raw_input` plus `if else:`? Marks out of ten, minus five, must try harder. I can't even be bothered to properly point you to `learnpython`.
What disappointed me with Universe is I patiently waited for months for the PC games they have as Coming Soon to arrive. They never did :(
/r/learnpython For starters, you're not using 'a', which you defined as the length of the input string. Next, print '(Name * 2)' will double 'Name' - ie: 'John' becomes 'JohnJohn'. Start with something like this: Python 3.6.2 (v3.6.2:5fd33b5, Jul 8 2017, 04:57:36) [MSC v.1900 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32 Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information. &gt;&gt;&gt; name = "John" &gt;&gt;&gt; for i in name: ... print(i) ... J o h n &gt;&gt;&gt;

Bravo. This is really cool
I would much rather see sum types before pattern matching, as I don't think it's very useful without them.
To be honest, use index/match, sumifs, or countifs or sumproduct. They are all very similar to python in what you would be doing except that's it's built in.
I use those but as data sets get larger, it's a pain to even open excel. So, I am trying to see if this can be solved in python.
I use the xlrd library for parsing excel sheets.
Read up about context managers. Also, your site has the word "paython" on it. Might want to fix that.
Scala is also multiparadigm, easily and commonly supporting a mix of OO and functional programming.
You don't need to explicitly import the print function in 3.
The word "proprietary" implies a specific ownership. Code or its license ain't everything. Don't forget infrastructure and governance are also factors. It's not easy at all to host your packages there, especially if you have C extensions. 
True.
So you have conda installed? Does conda create work? You want to create a virtualenv, then activate the source then anything you install while activated is just for that environment and not your general conda install. 
I see. Makes sense. 
Yeah I understand, same thing happened to me. Have a look at Pandas. Specifically merge, join, concat, .loc (filtering in Pandas)
Very practical advice. But I can do without the celebration of the status quo: _We build layer upon layer of leaky abstractions... Our languages and tools are obscure and different and new ones are invented all the time_. There's nothing inevitable about this. It's a function of what has been prioritized by the market and what programmers have built both within and in self-protection from dysfunctional organizations. We should also teach young people who are interested in coding to get angry at this legacy and empower them to change it.

... unless you are a _very_ seasoned game dev, this doesn’t sound like a good idea to me. Also, check out the GameDev sub at /r/gamedev 
I threw together a little sum-and-product-type library with rudimentary pattern matching here: [adt.py](https://github.com/ericgj/adt.py). Not ideal by any means, but I use it quite a bit in place of namedtuple and dicts. There's also [Coconut's pattern matching](http://coconut.readthedocs.io/en/master/DOCS.html#match) and [ADTs](http://coconut.readthedocs.io/en/master/DOCS.html#id96) . I would hope interest is building in the python community for these very useful tools that many other languages are adopting, but we shall see. 
Periodic boundary conditions?
Interesting, so open source with a BSD license means proprietary? It is almost like you are opposed to conda while knowing nothing about it. Your comment about c extensions just further demonstrates that.
Recently started getting tired of the sub-standard that is IDLE because I felt I could get more out of my IDE and took a look into Sublime. Needless to say, I instantly fell in love. When I found out that plugins are written in python, that was the selling point. Currently I'm working on a project using wx to add notifications from my Google Calendar into Sublime as to not break my workflow while still being updated on daily events.
That point is made in the first link, and Guido himself responds to it. Let me say that `if/elif` is not special to Python. It's pretty much the most basic structured control flow tool a language can have. And all languages that have pattern matching have an equivalent conditional statement. Somehow, they found pattern matching useful enough even in the presence of conditional branching statements. It probably takes one to program with it to see how useful it is, and how lacking are languages which don't have it. The main big advantage over `if/elif` is that a pattern matching statement would allow to execute code conditionally to some property of a value, and at the same time extract and bind a value from the matched object. So instead of having if condition(value): x = extraction(value) ... elif other_condition(value): x = other_extraction(value) You could have match value: case extraction(x): ... case other_extraction(x): ... Or something similar. And nothing prevents from having both "extraction" match and "condition" match, with what's called "guard expressions" in many languages: match value: case extraction(x) if condition: ... Also, as noted in the first link(I think by Guido himself), a match statement(or whatever its name) expresses a series of tests and attempts on a single value, whereas each conditional test in an `if/elif` can be completely unrelated to the others. As such, they serve different purposes. The idea of having a match protocol(as described in the second link) is, to me, fundamental for the addition to be the most pythonic and the most powerful. I'd be very saddened if a match statement was added with only some fixed patterns and no mechanism for extension(though it would probably still be very useful).
Why not? 
For me, I started learning Python after buying an Xbox One. I was wondering how I could go about sending messages/check notification feeds and found the wonderful XboxApi. I used that as my first python learning experiment (I had very little programming experience before this.) and I feel that reading into the docs of the api were very helpful in the process. I learned a lot in the process, and highly advise the XboxApi if you're wanting to learn Api's, as it is a pretty nifty tool.
Can you provide screenshots?
Thanks. Very cool. I myself have tried my hands at ADTs in Python([here](https://github.com/DrPyser/funklib/tree/master/datatypes)), though I prefer to use class syntax, and relie on one-level inheritance for defining sum types.
Thanks for the feedback ! On using Queue, my initial understanding of threading.Event is that it will block forever, so not suitable to do incremental billing like every x seconds. But looking at it again, I noticed `Event.wait()` has timeout parameter so it might work as well. But is there significant difference between Queue and Event ? Also I'm thinking of having actions other than stop as well, like pause, so that's why I'm using Queue. On the drift, I noticed it too. Putting this in real application, I noticed 1 to 2 seconds drift. I'm ok with this. Probably will add something like drift parameter to specify maximum seconds of drift we can tolerate. So the extra_seconds only will get charged if it's greater than the drift value. I understand something like this better implemented in C but am willing to compensate the accuracy with something more manageable. But I'm thinking maybe I can try implementing this in Go too. Look like a fun exercise.
I have never encountered or heard of that in Pycharm. That is bizarre. I've had some strange behaviours with remote interpreters accessing local files (when they make a side-by-side "remote" copy over the local version) but even that is not like what you're describing.
Pattern matching is heavily used in functional programming, and sum types are the most common to match against. Indeed, python should have full algebraic data types. It's kind of lame it doesn't. 
No, I have like 5x different versions of python installed on my computer. And I just started playing around with virtualenv. Virtualenv allows you to copy out a version of python on you computer into an isolated folder where you can add specific module versions for a specific project. 
I also would not advise this. If you are new to python, learn the basics first, please. You will thank yourself in the long run, I promise you. After you have learned basic python, I would advise looking into pygame (the standard in 2d games in python) All in all, the learning curve isn't TOO high for making games (given that you DO know the basics), but there are a few things that you SHOULD learn before you jump straight into game development
He said to use free online resources. In the time it took you to write this and reply to all the comments you could have found the resources quite easily. A simple google search of either subject you mentioned results in thousands of answers to the questions you need answered. You're obviously new to this subreddit and haven't seen the many before you that came looking for the same things only to find that they could have a) used the search bar and b) done some experimenting of their own. The only reason people won't offer you help is because you don't offer anything to them to let them know that you've actually put some effort into it. In fact, if you took a few minutes out of your day you may have found out that Pycharm is simply an IDE for python and that your code could be completed in, more than likely, under 30 lines of code. You gotta be able to do some things yourself and I'm sure you'll figure that out eventually. My pointer to you would be to use tutorialsonpoint (Google it), read about Pycharm and I/O as well as matrices. It's not hard. Good luck.
The weekend has come and almost gone. Why not just push what you have? All my repos start out broken 
You don't stop huh? :) I've been working all day on cleaning up the project. I'm literally about to push right now.
Also, here in Nashville and the weekend isn't gone yet ;)
Looking forward to reading it! You can do it
I really appreciate it. 
This is very unusual; I use tons of jetbrains products and the closest thing I've seen to this is "inspections" getting out of sync with the source code. You can, and should, report an issue. On the mac app is in `Help &gt; Report Problem`. This will let you create an issue in their bugtracker, which they are always *very* good about following up on. You'll need to create an account there, in that case, but I think its worth it. You could also try the "feedback" option in the `help` menu as well; i'm sure they'll follow up on it quickly as well.
Done.
Does the model tend to overreact and send notifications to the nurse more than it needs too? How does the nurse fell about it? Super cool
I agree that sum types/ADT are good to have in a language, and that pattern matching is especially useful when dealing with them. I don't follow how pattern matching isn't useful with other kinds of objects. The idea of pattern matching is simply to match a value against various patterns. You could match against type, against value, against attributes, or against arbitrary predicates. There's nothing specifically about sum types in pattern matching. It's just a better way to express both conditional branching and extracting values from objects. And by the way, nothing prevents you from defining sum types in Python right now. You could do it by defining an inheritance hierarchy with one level of subclasses, each of those subclasses being a product type member of the sum type represented by the whole hierarchy(and identified by the superclass). For example: class Either(tuple): # abstract methods go here class Left(Either): def __new__(cls, e): return super().__new__(cls, (e,)) # methods go here class Right(Either): def __new__(cls, x): return super().__new__(cls, (x,)) # methods go here (Immutable) product types can be tuple subclasses. The above pattern can be somewhat abstracted over using something like named tuple, either the typed or untyped version. I have made my own metaclass to include object caching and potentially other features: [funklib.datatypes.adt.py](https://github.com/DrPyser/funklib/blob/master/datatypes/adt.py)
Use Pandas library. Pandas is exactly made for this type of jobs. Just go through documentation and you're good to go. P.S: There are lot of ways for doing what you want to do. You could even use inbuilt data structures like list and dictionaries and read csv files using inbuilt libraries but I advice to go for Pandas. It can accomplish the task in fewer lines of code and even has inbuilt functions for some of things you want to do.

haha No it was plain ole AllergyAlert. Then my wife suggested Achoo, thankfully. I'm not a marketer! :)
I solved it, it was truly a pain in butt here are the things I was missing, some have pointed out and some I figured. Thank you for everyone who pointed to the right direction. first, I WAS MISSING this from __future__ import unicode_literals. #GoodbyeBlueSky96 comment two I Read this from rjw57 comment '§5.1 of https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1341.txt.'' lastly, I added this following reload(sys) sys.setdefaultencoding('utf-8') and also added this per suggestion from @rjw57 comment that my problem may stem from the way I was parsing/reading the contents if msg.is_multipart for part in msg.walk(): text = db.string_literal(msg.get_payload(0)).decode('utf-8) blob = db.string_literal(msg.get_payload(decode = True) db.query("Insert into .....blah blah) if text == 'text/plain' and 'attachment' not in blob: text = part.get_payload(decode=True) else: text = db.string_literal(msg.get_payload(decode=True)).decode('utf-8') The original code, did not walk through messages, in which I found walk() is excellent when dealing MIME . Lastly on the else statement, it was originally like this else: text = db.string_literal(msg.get_payload()).decode('utf-8') the else statement was for when the message is not multipart, in which case most of the messages were not multipart, the weird encoding. 
thank you! ,that was quiet helpful =D . solved it, and replied below the thread with what was going on
Maybe google something like "python http.server change port" and read the first result...

Nice! I just read over all your code and it looks good to me! That's awesome that you have the pi wired up to the inhailer's GPIO so that you don't have to manually put in data. &gt; Is there a better way than using a cron job? Cron job is great for a project like this I think. Did you have another idea? &gt; The Raspberry Pi isn't ideal. Maybe we should be using Nomie 2 to record events? (HT to sujins for this suggestion). I'd like to make it easy for the user to add their own method and their own host for storing data. ^ That normie thing seems cool. I love Pi's though personally so I'm bias. Can I see a pic of how you have it wired to the inhaler? Or is it a button he presses on the pi? &gt; I have a feeling many users will want to easily add their own models (Nueral Networks, GBMs, GLMs, etc.). What is the best way for users to add their own models? Yep for sure. I can't think of a better way to allow for that though. It doesn't seem like dropping in a replacement would be too hard the way its set up now. &gt; Should we support two languages? Currently I'm using Python and R. I think 2 is fine, especially since you seem to have an R background. This is the first R code I've ever seen &gt; I still have a lot of architectural concerns about this project so far, but I'm hoping things will be more smooth as a couple weeks' worth of development pass. Hell ya! What do you have planned for next steps? If I can make a suggestion I'd suggest moving the `engine` call into a function instead of having to type it in each file. Awesome job!!!
You changed your name to Latrine?
I have wanted to do a similar thing for tracking a whole bunch of web novels and stripping out a lot of the formatting to make them nicer for reading on a phone. Might still work on this some time.
Dude thanks!! &gt;Cron job is great for a project like this I think. Did you have another idea? Not really. Someone has written a cool [python scheduler](https://github.com/dbader/schedule) so maybe that. But no real ideas on this yet. &gt;Can I see a pic of how you have it wired to the inhaler? Or is it a button he presses on the pi? Def gonna post some pics and a step-by-step walk through. Right now, it's just two buttons on a bread board (one for inhaler, on for breathing treatment), but I'd LOVE to wirelessly put a bluetooth button on his inhaler somehow. &gt;What do you have planned for next steps? If I can make a suggestion I'd suggest moving the engine call into a function instead of having to type it in each file. Next steps include cleaning up the code, make it more modular, and have it work out of the box haha. That is, as soon as someone clones it it should require very minimal effort to get to where it's collecting data and training a model daily. I'd like for any custimization to be as easy as possible; still brainstorming how to do this. Good idea on the engine creation. 
`' '.join('These characters are too close together!')`
Also, I'd LOVE LOVE to make this non-developer friendly too. That is, actually make it a service that people can use to track their own allergies.
' (however many spaces you want here) '.join(list(your-string)).strip() String.strip() removes leading and trailing white space characters.

If you only want this to print out on the console, then on the lines that call the write() methods, you would use print(). As for your second wuestuons, I haven't used Bluehost personally, but it looks like they allow SSH access, so you could install BeatifulSoup via pip
That'd be awesome! I bet you could bundle it up into a mobile app for most people. And I bet you could whip up an app in kivy that logs an inhaler usage without too much trouble. Maybe I could help with that. You should definitely do a post about this here too when you're ready. This is a really cool project and I bet a lot of people would be willing to help. 
Awesome!!

my first project (best way to learn python). I am working on taking an email mbox, stored into mysql database and then turn them into a printable book with a style of conversational bubble. I am close to having a working prototype lol. the database is done, now working on the last part. I am hoping to expand it to include SMS database from android and iphone etc. As a python beginner, I thought why not learn the basics and then work on a project instead of picking a book. I found it rewarding, to work on the project and open a book when needed and reddit/stackoverflow. 
If you're into 3D modeling, you could try making Blender plugins. Python is very popular for making webapps--check out frameworks like cherrypy, flask, web.py, and django. One of my first projects was an IRC bot; those are pretty easy and fun to make. Reddit bots, web scrapers, AI processing and other scientific computing... there's lots you can do with Python.
Just a thought, but if you turn it into an iOS app, you could grab health data from there. Apple Watch has a heart rate sensor, but I’m not sure if anyone is already doing this. In other news, this is truly fantastic. It’s great to see programming, something that I often do for fun, be used to make the world a more efficient place. I applaud you, well done! 
I would assume that most GUI toolkits that have a type of CSS-eqsue styling system will be able to have something similar if not exactly like material design. For example - using PyQt and styles implemented with QSS/QML or QtQuick: https://github.com/papyros/qml-material https://github.com/ethanhs/material
Thanks for the ideas, will definitely look into that!
A couple of things: * I linked to the `dev` branch since I'm still working on getting to a better state for release (mainly docs and better tests, but also potentially a few more features) * I am looking for anyone willing to code review or contribute in any way. Feel free to create issues against the repo. I've also got a slack channel for chatting about things. If you're interested PM me your email for an invite. * This library is using more advanced level python programming including class inheritance, monkey patching and a meta class * This isn't necessarily directly tied to IP packets. In fact, I've intentionally strayed away from making direct IP packets at first to make this available for any type of custom packet
That's actually a good project to do hahaha 
Sorry for contributing to the list lol

I know when I was just getting out of elementary school quite a while ago now, there was big controversy because schools no longer allowed kids to carry their own medications on them - including inhalers. You have to go to the school nurse to get it. If they saw you have them without permission, you got in trouble. It was a bad system, but I assume what this bot is for.

I have a question for you! I've often thought about similar uses for hobbyist automation, but any time it comes to human health, I always get scared because of my experiences with technology failing. It makes not want to trust it 100% and in the end if I still have to monitor the outcomes why not just do it myself 100%? How do you deal with this issue?
I'm currently learning from this: https://www.amazon.co.uk/Programming-Python-Complete-Introduction-Developers/dp/0321680561 Seems to be a great book out of all the Python books I've seen but I'm interested to see how other people are finding their learning experience. Do people find that videos help their learning or is it a bit too passive?
Yep. Using the roll function make the derivatives really easy to compute with periodic domain. But this is a kind of prototype : triflow (I'm the author) is able to solve 1d problems just by writing the equations, and the next major iteration is to extend to 2d/3d with arbitrary boundaries. 
I just threw together something quick to visualize tonal structures (keys, scales, and chords). I call it [PitchClock](https://github.com/hosford42/pitchclock). I've been drawing tone clocks since I was a teenager to figure out interesting new chord combinations when I write music, and now I have an easy way to generate nice clean visualizations I can include in web pages, etc.
Cool stuff!
spoiler alert: you are not as infallible as you think. Just like technology can fail, so can you.
Spoiler alert? LOL.
It's a bit vague what sort of help you're asking for. If you can be more specific, I can probably help out, since I'm familiar with both Python and GAs.
Fitness function is dependant on the problem you are facing. You need to define it yourself. Let's say you're dealing with linear regression problem: you need to find a "best fitting" line for your data points. The fitness function will be mean of squared (or absolute) distances of datapoints from your line - the lower, the better. 
As a European that sounds horrifying, do all schools not allow children to carry inhalers?
Funny enough, My first name is Acho
I'm curious, did you tell the nurse you were doing this, and what she should expect? Or does she think that you send those messages every time?
I think it depends on the district/city/state, I was too young to know if it was happening elsewhere. Kids are not trusted at all in the US, and as such schools are pretty in control of just about anything in a kids life. As an example - if you get in a fight with someone out of school (even if they go to a different school) you could both be punished by the schools for it. Not sure how it is in other parts of the US, but it's how it was around Chicago suburbs
Fun fact: achoo is a 'thanks' in Lithuanian. Cool naming
I don't have children but I imagine if I did I'd rather my child get into trouble repeatedly than risk their life. I can't understand the reasoning behind an action that would so pointlessly risk a child's well-being. 
The problem is that the school can't stop it in the middle - it's out of school, after hours. And punishing with in-school suspension (which is the go-to nowadays) is more a reward than anything because they get to finish all hw before going home. The better solution is the harder one, which is to get a mediator, which the schools don't care enough to do because that's time and money. It's not that they're doing too much, it's that they do the wrong thing. 
Here, at least to the best of my knowledge, schools don't tend to get involved in students lives to such a degree. Or rather, would be unlikely to get involved for a fight outside of school grounds, so it's a fairly alien concept for me to try and imagine, it seems like it'd be more work, and more money in the long term for american schools. Thanks for answering my questions.
It 's a good project to do on your phone if you're on a long car ride, or camping. Problem is you can't test the network part of the code until you get back in service range.
I wouldn't think this post would have this success. Some extra stuff : the version of `Triflow` I have used is the dev version (the one i'm using in my phd), so If someone want to run the notebook: pip install git+git://github.com/locie/triflow@dev I do not guarantee it will run smoothly (I plan to release a stable after I send my manuscript). The equations are from the Shallow-Water wikipedia page, and this work is a prototype for the next iteration of the solver which will be able to deal with 2D equations (and more). I have chosen Shallow-Water because I plan to help my room-mate. He will need some river-flooding simulation, and I don't like running commercial-based code (or huge codes) without trying to implement at least a toy model to "feel" how the model beheave. Enjoy !
&gt; You have to go to the school nurse to get it. If they saw you have them without permission, you got in trouble. It was a bad system "Bad system" being a euphemism for "a kid fucking died because of these morons".
LOL ok, someone got angry. Can you move past the insults part and tell me how can I convert my binary wheels to conda packages? I haven't seen an easy way. As I understood it from their docs I have to add another layer of build boilerplate and rebuild everything. How is that easy?
WHy don't you contain this in a single python script and call the Rscript parts from within python? So it is 1 command. It seems odd that you have split it up in a workflow fashion.
The best thing that I love about Python is you can almost do anything you want. From web development to artificial intelligence, Python provides heaps of libraries that can allow you to do some cool stuff. Though Python can do a lot, I would suggest that you also start to pick up another language that compliments Python and make projects that combine the two languages. Even if it's just something like learning a database language. All depends on what you are wanting to do with Python though.
My first experiences with API's was Blizzard and Riot's API's. https://dev.battle.net/ https://developer.riotgames.com/ Alternatively, you can just google websites with API's and go from there.
A Canadian kid died some years ago because their inhaler was safely stored by the school. Horrible. 
Very nice, and clean i would like to mention, that you need to split the text in f2: pprint(dict(Counter(Path(input('enter filename')).read_text().split()).most_common(5)))

I honestly am not sure what I want to do with it, I just love coding languages and the possibilities so I wanted to learn some (: 
Do you have any projects that you want to do? Also, do you have a GitHub that you can upload your projects too?
Oh thanks! You're right, I forgot that step :)
No I haven't found any projects yet and no I don't know what GitHub is
GitHub is a web-based Git or version control repository. Git is a version control system (VCS) which just records changes made to a repository. You can search GitHub for projects and share your own projects with others. Best of all you can use it as a portfolio when you go to apply for a job. If I want to make a project but don't know where to start I usually search GitHub for any existing repositories then use them as a baseline.

Read both of the worksheets into into pandas dataframes (e.g. DF1 and DF2). I have assumed that the ID column has a header "id". You can then use the merge function as follows: merged = DF1.merge(DF2, on="id", indicator=True, how="outer") this returns a pandas dataframe with a column called "_merge". this indicates whether the ID is in both dataframes, only the left, or only the right. you can then use pandas to create the filtered lists you want, and output them however you want.
Ohhh okay, thanks for the reference. Is it a free registration?
I'd suggest Flask because of the great amount of resources available for it. also there's a great amount of plugints you can plug into your systems, such as flask-apscheduler (for schedule tasks), flask-sqlalchy (orm for most dbs)...
It's free if you're a student, or $7 a month if not. 
Je ne parle pas français.
Correct me if i'm wrong, but i think its free unless you want private repo
Seems like a pollen/air measuring system for the school would be a better and more universal solution. Somebody should be selling this to schools. That way the school can mount a device on-prem that measures all these values in the air and warns them if their students might be more exposed than usual.
&gt; LONG TERM: How to make this non-developer friendly? How can the typical person with allergies/asthma make use of this day-to-day? Can we make this a mobile app? I think this is my end goal. I would say stick to python (but then i would on a python forum ;). Seriously though if you want to make this development and distribution friendly keeping it all in python will make life easier in the long run, since there's better tools for managing projects and building web apps or distributing as mobile apps. The GLM you need is in scikit learn or statsmodels packages (I recommend scikit learn for its community). Similarly if you don't like running it as a cron job, with python it's easy enough to make a service deamon /server that can react to new input (i.e. every time it gets new input it updates the model). You can make such a service run on boot on the RPi using systemd.
Comme c'est spécifique à NumWorks tu devrais plutôt poser la question sur le forum dédié à cette machine. J'y ai trouvé [cette discussion ](https://www.reddit.com/r/numworks/comments/6y1w0r/envoyer_un_script_python_depuis_lordinateur/)
Optimization is tricky and certainly not something I'd try as a beginner. A fitness function is what you're trying to optimize for, like total cost. It is one number and that's it. The harder part is how you calculate that from the input variables. DEAP is a module I've used. It's a bit tricky to use, but it works.
Everything fails, given enough time. The best option is usually multiple options
Why a Pi? It looks like the entire application could easily fit within the limits of the free tier on google cloud: https://cloud.google.com/free/docs/always-free-usage-limits Other cloud providers have similar offerings.
Thank you! I really appreciate it. Good call on the iOS app. I've been thinking of best way to convert this to an app. 
I think a good amount of skepticism is healthy. I don't rely on these types of projects 100% since it's bound to make mistakes. I use the data it gives me and my own intuition to make decisions. This project, however, is very low risk and was more for fun and curiosity. Hopefully it can help some people battle their allergies/asthma but if not, it was still fun to build.
hahaha great question. She knows I'm an avid technologist and I don't flood her inbox with false positives :)
Used to be shithouse
I still have a lot of clean up to do, but wanted to get something out to the community asap. I'm still thinking through the work flow and what would be best. Great idea!
Good idea! I'd be all for that.
Good stuff. I'm currently toying with the idea of keeping all the python/R code for now (removing the R code later) and just hosting that data on some cloud server that feeds new data to a remote database. Then some front end (any front end really) can just query that database everyday and get the new data. I think it would make any mobile app super simple and easy to build. This is what I'm currently thinking for the high level design. 
This project still has a lot of efficiency and clean up to go. I'm in no way satisfied with the current design, but I wanted to go ahead and get something out to the community. Future versions will definitely be more centralized and likely hosted on a remote server.
The model is very crude at the moment. It's still in the early phases so I get all emails before hand and prevent flooding the nurse's inbox with a ton of false positives :) 
He does not. The school is pretty good about monitoring him.
Of the times you sent the email to the nurse, how often does your child actually need the inhaler? Have you tried creating an ML model for this yet?
haha my child always needs his inhaler! ;) But seriously, I don't trust the model enough right now to have the system send her an email automatically, so I'll have it send me emails first so I can filter them out, for now. I have a good idea (from his symptomns in the morning, to what the weather is like) of when he'll need it so I rely a lot on my own intuition at the moment.
Are you feeding your own decisions about whether to send it on back into the model?
I like this.
TIL people with asthma need their inhalers, also I’m an idiot Anyway thanks for all the info!
no but thats a great idea! 
 for char in str: if char != str[:-1] and char != str[1:] Like this?
Anyone have a login they could share? 
So what equations are you solving? I figured it was the washer equation in 2D.
Friends don't let friends learn Python 2.7 :| &gt; Python 2.7.2 was released on June 11th, 2011 Dude.. 
I'm pretty sure that Perkin Elmer sells that kind of system to schools.

Have you heard of Propeller Health? They're a startup doing something very similar targeting asthma and COPD patients.
python for finance is a very wide spectrum. What exactly are you interested at? Analytics, trading, services, scientific computing, machine learning?
Yes, exactly what I meant, but didn't want to look up a source on that to make sure. I personally would never allow the school to take it away, nor allow them to keep a spare inhaler that God knows what they will do with, or who they will give it to. A school nurse is not a doctor, and a school isn't a hospital. They don't really have the moral right to control a life-saving medication.
I haven't but will look into them. Thanks!
It's the [Shallow Water](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shallow_water_equations) equation, so called Saint-Venant equation. They are derived from the Navier-Stokes equation with the assumption of a velocity field homogeneous accross the z coordinate. It's thus valid only for H &gt; l, l being the boundary-layer lenght. It's valid for ocean wave modeling, water flooding... In my PhD, I make the opposite assumption : I have tiny waves (H &lt; 1mm), so I consider that I do not go over the boundary layer lenght. In that case, we have another assumption : we consider the velocity field to be parabolic. In all case, we can integrate the velocity between the ground and the fluid interface, leading to a 2D problem instead of a 3D one.
**Shallow water equations** The shallow water equations (also called Saint-Venant equations in its unidimensional form, after Adhémar Jean Claude Barré de Saint-Venant) are a set of hyperbolic partial differential equations (or parabolic if viscous shear is considered) that describe the flow below a pressure surface in a fluid (sometimes, but not necessarily, a free surface). The shallow water equations can also be simplified to the commonly used 1-D Saint-Venant equation. The equations are derived from depth-integrating the Navier–Stokes equations, in the case where the horizontal length scale is much greater than the vertical length scale. Under this condition, conservation of mass implies that the vertical velocity of the fluid is small. *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Python/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.27

As an adult with asthma since childhood, I urge you to fight the school to allow your son to carry his inhaler if he is responsible enough. Once, I almost died because I didn't have my inhaler on me, and there is little in life more terrifying than not being able to breathe and not being able to tell the people around you what is going on. 
Wow for some reason I just figured that having a kid carrying an inhaler wasn't possible. After reading these comments though, I'm definitely gonna fight to allow him to carry it. His asthma isn't life threatening, but even to have him not miss so much work because he has to go to the nurse's office would be huge.
Just wanted to thank you all for all the suggestions. I'm currently researching a little on these options, and others i received via PM. I'll let you know what i'm going for in the end once i know a bit more on everything. thanks again.
This is pretty cool. I would have loved this when I was learning to code. 
This will probably help the adoption of Jupyter Notebooks. Onboarding new people can be painful and this looks like it would solve that!

This belongs in /r/learnpython, not here. &gt; I see that it's taking today and adding it to today's weekday number minus 4 then getting the remainder of 7 No, not really. A `timedelta` object represents a difference in time, an interval. You can add a `timedelta` object to a `date` object and get a new `date` object, and that's what the code is doing. All it's doing is calculating the number of days needed to add to today to get to the next Friday. For example, if today was Wednesday, then `today.weekday()` would be 2, and since Friday is 4, that means 4 - 2 is 2, as there are two days until Friday. So the `timedelta` interval is 2 days ([note that the first parameter of the constructor is days](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#timedelta-objects).) The modulo in this example doesn't do anything; it only becomes relevant if the day number is greater than 4. For example if it's Saturday (5), then 4 - 5 is -1, which gets normalized to 6. (Under mod 7, going back one day is equivalent to going forward six days.) 
PyQt (via QML) does all of those.
You can install it via conda: conda install -c menpo opencv https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23119413/how-to-install-python-opencv-through-conda For working with video though you might want to check out moviepy: http://zulko.github.io/moviepy/
I have been doing this the past few weeks, and yes, so far all I've discovered is it is freaking complicated (please someone tell me I'm wrong). Anyways I wrote a Bash script to automate the entire install of OpenCV for Python 2 and 3. You might want to check it out and customize the installation folders to your likings. So far it's worked on two different Linux machines without error, but it does take a while. Also this script installs some other stuff I use, but OpenCV is first, so just delete everything after it if you would like. Let me know if you have any questions. [link](https://github.com/dlowrey/PiProjects/blob/master/Utils/rpi_setup.sh) Edit: the comments at the top are suggestions for when installing on raspberry pi devices, you probably don't need them otherwise. 
obligatory /r/learnpython is the place to go for this. so to understand this you need to see the documentation on the [weekday method](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.date.weekday). So the weekday() method returns the day of the week as weekday() | Week day ---|--- 0 | Monday 1 | Tuesday 2 | Wednesday 3 | Thursday 4 | Friday 5 | Saturday 6 | Sunday So what we're after is Friday, which is the magic number "4" in the script. you can read the it in English as "add to today the difference in time between any Friday and today's weekday in days" What happens if it's Monday? `today.weekday()` is `0` `4 - 0 = 4` so 4 days difference to add today to get the date of the coming Friday. What happens if it's Friday? `today.weekday()` is `4` `4 - 4 = 0` so it's Friday, we don't add anything. What if it's Saturday? Well then it would get tricky, if we just did the `4-today.weekday()` bit we'd get `today.weekday()` is 5 `4-5=-1` so we would add negative one to today and get yesterday, the Friday just gone. well we can fix that with a mathematical construct known as `modulus` or `clock maths`. Modulus is just the remainder after integer division. (5 divided by 3 is 1 remainder 2, so the modulus there would be "2") `4 -5` is `-1` `(4 - 5) % 7` is 6 If you don't understand the impact of negatives on modulus you can see https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/519845/modulo-of-a-negative-number That then means we always know how many days ahead the next Friday is, which we can just add to today.
Please don't use technology to alert your son when needs the inhaler .. just wear the inhaler around his neck at all time so it's simply always with him to avoid emergency.
"Boba" isn't really incorrect. It's just a direct transliteration of [波霸奶茶/boba naicha](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E6%B3%A2%E9%9C%B8%E5%A5%B6%E8%8C%B6)
Are you using some kind of macro? You can edit multpile lines in a file simultaneously, maybe it's true of files as well. Secondly are you on Mac or linux? Could you have done a ln -sf to create one of the files? Can you edit file 2 and.it change file 1?
Yeah in pinyon in mainland China and even then it would be bōbà nǎichá, so...... It's bubble tea. At least in English it is. Edit: I didn't see the naicha added in that link, the emphasis wasn't on the markings but on the completion of the transliteration
I'd do it like this: new_str = "" for i in range (0, len(str) - 1): new_str += str[i] + " " new_str += str[len(str) - 1] Probably not the most compact way of doing it, but it works. new_str contains the modified string.
Welcome to the fabulous world of programming, for questions go here : /r/learnpython 
Did you post to /r/learnpython ?
I haven't been to mainland China, but in Taiwan, the English menus often just say "boba tea" (The Chinese menus usually list it as 珍珠奶茶/zhenzhu naicha though). And "boba" is the same thing as "bōbà" except without the tonal marks. That's like arguing that typing the name Xi Jinping in an English newspaper is wrong because it's really Xí Jìnpíng.
You missed the point boba naicha would be the term not boba then mix it with the Anglo tea, it would be boba naicha if you wanted to use the word boba and again not English. So in English it's bubble tea as was first marketed. Not Boba tea which is an awful attempt at artificially manufacturing a niche and being pretentious all in one. And Taiwan is Chinese so pinyon still stands. Boba is incorrect in English, in Chinese sure it works.
To be honest, that isn't that complex for installing a package from source. It's pretty par for the course. If you don't want to do a from source install, I recommend installing anaconda. It will come with many great packages precompiled but also let you download a lot of precompiled packages too. It's also potentially easier on other distros that will actually have it in their official or user package manager repo. Arch for example has it in aur.
I personally know Taiwanese Americans who have called it "boba tea" in English for years. I really don't think this is some sort of insidious marketing attempt.
I'm glad to have more Jupyter cloud hosts. Currently I use the free notebooks hosted at https://notebooks.azure.com/, because it was the first I learned about. 
It's pretentious and inaccurate. Just because you know them and they use it doesn't make it cute or right.
Well, it depends on what you mean by possible. The rules might prohibit it, but if you truly need it to live this is one of those rules worth breaking, fighting the administration, or changing schools over. When you don't have oxygen, nothing else in the world matters. 
It's a good change! A goooood change.
Don't know if the problem is Linux or Python. I gave up and used docker. It was linked to Python 3.4 as well so half my project needs 3.6, and the other half only works with the 3.4 docker image.
face detection also needs those missing video parts which is why i could not use it
thanks! &gt; moviepy I'll def check it EDIT: moviePy does it what I need, it saves some frames to disk, it would be awesome to have them in a variable instead (like an array) but this will do. Thanks again
A perfect Sunday code project
You're looking for r/learnpython. When you post there, though, please include whatever you've tried thus far - any code, even just any ways you've considered approaching the problem.
Where do you source your weather data? Many schools also have weather stations installed on the premises. Are you focusing on weather data from your son's school's weather station or averaging from schools in the area? Do you log your son's condition in the morning at home? If you had some objective measures you could log, you could feed that back into your ML model. This is such a cool project! Edit: I see that a mobile app is your goal. I think that's the right plan. If you use the app to log his condition at home, and it presents you with weather and allergen data based on a specified location, it would recommend you to send a preconfigured email to the specified addresses. That recommendation should be based on ML model that you inform with a "was treatment needed" data at the end of the day so that it learns if the conditions activated the need for treatment and it can make better recommendations in the future but only auto-send optionally.
thanks!
Oh okay, my bad. Thanks for the info!
You'll have to report back if you do try Gryd. What are the pros and cons of Gryd vs Azure?
You want to start at the beginning with some tutorials and get a feel for variables, loops and syntax before you jump into making anything on your own. Programming is like lifting weights, no one picks up the big ones on their first day.
Let me know if you find any problems 
Each programmer has his own workflow, you'll probably have lots of different answers and you'll have to decide on your own and which one you like the most. I start from the beginning, yes, it sounds obvious, but sometimes it isn't. Let's take your example, you want to build a game. Every (graphical) game has stuff drawn in your screen; therefore the first thing that I would do would be to get something drawn to the screen. Doesn't matter what, doesn't need to be fancy, pretty or even functional. ALL I need at this point is to make the graphics library draw something on the screen. So, okay, after a couple of minutes reading the documentation and a couple of tutorials, I've drawn a circle. Not perfect, but could be worse. Now, I'll choose a random image in my images folder and I'll make the graphics library draw that to the screen. Voilà, it works. Now, I'll just follow the same process for everything else, until I'm done. Instead of writing a *program* I write lots of different, smaller, programs that work together to solve a common goal. **TL;DR**: Start with small parts, make the graphics work, then the sound, then the controls and so on and so forth.
Great ideas!! I'm currently using Dark Sky to get weather data, but i'll definitely look into local weather stations. Currently I'm not tracking his conditions at home, but great idea. 
If you say "boba tea" to any Taiwanese American, they will immediately know what you're talking about. That's how language works. The term is pretty well recognized, maybe just not in your circle of acquaintances: https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/boba_tea Anyway, do you get so worked up over mixed language terms like "Yangtze River" in English? I don't see why this is such a religious issue for you. Linguistic prescriptivism sucks. It just makes life unnecessarily difficult for yourself and others.
Plenty of great info and guides too. It's my go to for a quick GUI, except I usually just use old fashioned QT and skip QML for quick things. QML is for when I want to get serious.
Skip the pip install entirely. If you aren't that Linux competent it can be problematic. Just install with the package manager.
I choosed another library, moviePy
&gt; **now** in the Cloud Wasn't jupyter always intended to be in the cloud? Sure, you can run the web server locally and go to it from your browser, but the real value was running that server on an actual *server*. So this seems like non-news?
Note that cocalc, formerly sagemathcloud is much cheaper and more mature alternative. I use Azure Notebooks for teaching a class and only few glitches so far.
Azure is free
There is amazing source at www.quantstart.com, but its quite advanced, I had to do a MSc in Finance to really understand the concepts. For the rest, any python book or online source will be fine to get started with. My favourites being the http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/, https://people.duke.edu/~ccc14/sta-663/index.html and http://scikit-learn.org/stable/
I thought I was in /r/learnpython. Sorry for the the confusion and thanks to /u/Rhomboid and /u/colloidalthoughts for responses anyways.
Are you using Linux? If yes, at the top of your Python script, put `#!/path/to/python`. Otherwise, run `python myscript.py` in the terminal (`python3` if you're using python3).
If you say Boba tea I know what you're talking about. The point isn't understanding. I think this conversation is lost on you my guy. 
Im using windows, thanks though
`raw_input` says it's Python 2.
I didn't know the GRPC. It is similar to Apache Thrift. They main difference is GP RPC works over HTTP/2 and the Apache Thrift uses TCP Socket. Very nice.
Ah thanks so much! I think I'll use one of the basic ones you suggested and then move to quantstart when I feel more ready - it looks really good. I found this course online too https://www.udemy.com/python-for-finance-investment-fundamentals-data-analytics/ - have you heard any good things about it by chance?
gid gud
yeah its the first time i am hearing about this and it seems really cool. Will try a project on this.
Can you share some examples that leverage QML? Been looking at it but I cannot find many examples that use python. 
"Automate the Boring Stuff" is a great way to learn python. It is not specific to finance, but its approach is much more 'real world' than some of the other learning resources. As a non-programmer it was great for me and I now do sales forecasting at work using python. 
Potentially an unpopular opinion, but have you considered something like a flask backend and a web browser interface? Very bloated and resource intensive, but there are loads of guides for html / css / js. Plus its easy to make things cross platform. Plus web dev skills are usually a good thing to have. 
Using generators will speed it up, but having multiple nested for-loops indicates there is probably a better way to do whatever you are trying to accomplish. There may be something in `itertools` you can use to improve the process as well.
When you are starting out you just have to pull at a thread. Start coding whatever you feel the most interrested in. Dont worry too much about specific things. Just code. Read some articles. Watch youtube articles. Read books. Gradually you will need better methodology and more theory. But that will come in its own time when you need to learn it.
You can also buy a weather station kit for the RPi that might be interesting to play around with if his school district doesn't have weather stations. Another idea if they don't: Talk to the school's science department and see if they would be interested in signing up to [host a weather station](http://www.ambientweather.com/schools.html). They aren't terribly expensive or difficult to set up, and could be used directly to teach any curriculum regarding weather (obviously). You might even be able to crowdfund it at the next PTA meeting if needed.

I have not played with anything to write to excel, but I would assume it is **not** thread/process safe. I am also going to assume that the `e=a+b+c` is the computationally expensive part. As such, you can do something like the following. Note that is is sketched out code and not tested. May have a bug or two (or more); Also, it is **really important** that you use `imap` so it will yield as it happens and not try to cache this all in memory import multiprocessing as mp import itertools def e(a,b,c): """ Performs the hard work """ return a+b+c def _e_wrapper(abc): """ tuple wrapper for `e`""" a,b,c = abc # unwrap return e(a,b,c),abc # Return the input so you have it later in the loop abc_gen = itertools.product(list1,list2,list3) # nested for loops pool = mp.Pool() for e_res,abc in pool.imap( _e_wrapper,abc_gen): a,b,c = abc row,col = some_function_of_abc(a,b,c) #???????? worksheet.write(row,col,e_res) pool.close() Some final notes: * This really belongs in /r/learnpython * Nested for loops are usually indicative of an inefficient way to do something and scale *really* poorly. Maybe you need them? Probably not. * One nice this about this workflow, is you can easily wrap that final loop in something like [`tqdm`](https://github.com/noamraph/tqdm) * Just to be clear, the computation is split but the writing (which *may* the bottleneck) is not. 
You have only scratched the surface... installing opencv is a PITA

Many websites use javascript to modify the source code of the website after it's loaded. What you have now only gets the original source. If you want to replicate what your browser does you need to find a way to execute the javascript. It would be easier to use `selenium` to remote control your webbrowser, let it modify the source code and then get the modified source. --- If you have more questions like this it's better to post them on /r/learnpython.

I've been running through the python challenges on hackerrank.com 
They already do. You can update it like this: label['text'] = 'new text' Or you can use `textvariable` instead of `text` to display the value of a tkinter Variable, and changing the variable will change the display as well. --- If you have more questions like this it's better to post them on /r/learnpython.

Thank you, I'm using webdriver.Chrome("C:\ChromeDrive\chromedriver.exe") but I'm getting a "OSError: [WinError 740] The requested operation requires elevation" error. I changed chromedriver's settings so make it run as admin but it's still not working. Any advice for this problem? Edit: I also disabled UAC but that didn't fix it either
thanks
I use [tablib](http://docs.python-tablib.org/en/master/) to stage the data. so mydata.xlsx --&gt; python[xlrd/openpyxl] --&gt; tablib &gt; as data sets get larger, it's a pain to even open excel Python needs to open the file as well. No no gain there. 
I was told about one school in the UK that did that was well. Dangerous.
I personally built an app like that with CefPython. Web internals give you total control over the GUI, cross platform, easy to use. Use Qt to control the windows, there are examples of how to do it in the CefPython repo. Plus the author browses this forum. :) Paging u/cztomczak 
yep
so this can be used to background processes like for web app ? I', currently using Celery
As a follow-up, I'm trying to use Splinter on top of Pytest at the moment. However, I can't seem to get my Splinter test to register as a test in pytest. Pytest runs the code and then acts like there were zero tests run. Suggestions? from splinter import Browser browser = Browser('chrome') def test_navpoint_login(browser): url = 'http://companyXURL.com' browser.visit(url) browser.fill('email', "sarah@example.com") browser.fill('password', "blarg") button = browser.find_by_name('login') button.click() browser.quit()
For me it breaks 32 bit windows support. Had to go back to 3.2.1 on that particular VM. However, it works perfectly on linux 32/64, win 64 and mac osx.
Thanks alot for help! How would you include this in my code? I've been stuck on this excercise for 2 days now and I'm running out of time. this is explanation that how this program should behave: Receives two filenames as parameters sys.argv[1] and sys.argv[2]: input filename and output filename. Writes each unique non-whitespace character of the input file into the output file. The characters are printed to the output file in the same order as they appear (for the first time) in the input file. The output characters are separated by single spaces (no space before the first or after the last character). My code is really close to this.
Isn't [PEP523](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0523/) a valuable aid? If you overload frame evaluation for coverage, what needs to be done is to set a flag on each evaluated frame. The bytecode also contains suitable information to reconstruct the source context ( file + line ).
Just an FYI, you can set this up yourself - [jupyterhub](https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub)
Dear billsil and Kleinernull, thank you so much for your help! I'm afraid my question wasn't very clear. I can see how one may think about Conway here, yet although I'm sure your answers are super accurate, they didn't answer my questions. So I decided to rephrase the question and post it here: https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/72ejz1/some_problems_with_usergenerated_objects/ Thanks again for your time!
I'm writing something similar in Pyramid with SQLAlchemy scaffold. Works like a charm on Windows also with MS SQL Server. [Marker](https://github.com/krysros/marker) -- Catalog of companies for General Contractors.
You can run the following commands to get it up: PS C:\Users\user&gt; python -m virtualenv test Using base prefix 'C:\\Users\\user\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python36' New python executable in C:\Users\user\test\Scripts\python.exe Installing setuptools, pip, wheel...done. PS C:\Users\user&gt; .\test\Scripts\activate.ps1 (test) PS C:\Users\user&gt; (Get-Command python.exe).Path C:\Users\user\test/Scripts\python.exe 
Possibly? I'm not sure I totally understand what you're proposing. What would the flag be used for? Right now I think there's probably not much need for any sort of fundamental rearchitecting of how coverage works - I think most of the performance costs can removed by boring optimisation techniques and better data representation. It might be that it needs something clever to get the final mile, but I think it's worth picking the low hanging fruit first.
Personally, I'd recommend going much lighter on classes, until you need to. Your `Row` class does not add anything on top of using a list directly. Generally speaking, one tends not to write accessor (get/set/modify) functions for Python class values. You can store pretty much everything that you need as lists of strings. You can then use functions on top of that to handle the context and the relationships. There are a lot of more complicated constructs that you could use but I'd start with the basic data structures and only move beyond them when you absolutely must.
I has to switch to http using some barely documented underscore method because google pubsub client started throwing mass errors using grpc I always wonder if what they give us is what they actually use or if it is more of their cloud marketing style google bullshit.
Thank you very much. Maybe that's a difference between c++ and python, using less getters/setters... I now understand that I can add objects to an array at runtime without specifying its name. Can the objects still determine their position and their neighbors when moved/updated?
When it comes to cloud pub/sub, I have been told the server side code is almost entirely the same thing they use internally, except for an extra layer on top that counts the monies and such. But given horrific quality of the client drivers, I can't imagen they are based on any internal code.
Yup, they're pretty darn close, conceptually. My employer tried using Thrift many years ago, but it went very poorly, partially because there were significant incompatibilities between Thrift implementations for different platforms back in those days.
I too have not been successful in finding guides for PyQt5 and QML. Here is my example project, where I am trying to figure out how to package PyQt5/QML applications. https://github.com/siecje/qml-testing 
To add to your small parts take: Design your classes first. That is, write out the class name and methods, and just put pass for all the definitions. Work on finding a layout that makes sense and allows you to make all the calls you need. For instance a player might need to move so you could create a global move() function that takes in some value (lets say the vector of movement) and applies this to the character. You arent concerned with how that vector came to be, or the specifics of how that vector is utilized. You just need to define what the player can do. Hell you can leave the method args out too for now, and just name the move method. Once youve got a sensible interface, you can go about designing /how/ that interface works, ie how move() actually act's on the vector. Thats where all the "little programs" come in.
&gt; just do it and youll figure it out Yea this worked for NASA because they were brilliant and had to lay the ground work. Time to stand on the shoulders of giants, dont make people reinvent the wheel.
Pretty clever, great job! 
What I don't like so much about Jupyter is that setting up a server properly (read: multi user support (ideally with admin webinterface for user management), https atleast with a self signed certificate) is not as trivial as it should be. I mean like I have a server with quite a few containers which run owncloud, syncthing, webdav, a photo gallery, general purpose webserver (with proper letsencrypt certificate which I'm going to automatically sync with the other containers) etc, yet my jupyter container is still plain http and single user because it's just such a hassle to set up. It doesn't even come with service files, so that you could have it autostart for each user like you can with syncthing in one single command - whhyyyy?
If anybody has any questions about CoCalc I can answer them (wstein@sagemath.com).
Well it's good to plan out how your game will work before hand. You can plan it out and how it'll work on a piece of paper or something like that. Where to begin coding?.... well what ideas do you have so far? Will the player have a class with health, damage, etc as class variables? You could create that first. Or the actual main program you can start writing and then add the classes/functions that you'd call as you go. I wouldn't spend too much time thinking about a question like this. Just dive in and see how far you can get and keep going. You are developing a skill and that skill is improved through hands on practice.
Does something like Gryd solve those issues for you, @skilltheamps?
You sneeze to say thank you in Lithuania?
Boulderdash. Trying stuff out because of interrest is a perfectly valid way to learn. Every good programmer I have know has approached it that way in the beginning. If he had asked "i have programmed for a year and i want to get better" my response would have been completely different. When you just start out it is import to play around and get a feel for the conceptual framework of coding. Online tutorials and a hobby projec is perfectly fine at that level.
 * The ElementPath implementation is now compiled using Cython, which speeds up the ``.find*()`` methods quite significantly. * The modules ``lxml.builder``, ``lxml.html.diff`` and ``lxml.html.clean`` are also compiled using Cython in order to speed them up. Tasty.
Now that I try it, and despite the similar target audience and marketing, Gryd is much different than CoCalc. Gryd is exactly just a hosted single-user Jupyter notebook server running in a container dedicated to a user. The UI is precisely the plain vanilla Jupyter UI. Gryd seems not locked down very much (e.g., no blocking of arbitrary outgoing network connections, etc....). CoCalc is different in that it has multiuser realtime sync (like Google docs), records the complete history of editing all documents, has chatrooms and chat next to documents, has a LOT more Python, etc., libraries preinstalled, etc., but is also a lot more locked down. We've been working on CoCalc since 2012, so have hit all kinds of problems, abuse, etc., and also rewritten the backend infrastructure many times over the years.
Try with geckodriver, it never gave me issues on Windows and macOS.
Nope, but thank you for that one!
You're writing to csv every loop is very slow. Can you use pandas and it's to_csv function? 
Honestly, I don't like online courses, having a real teacher next to you is a completely different experience. Depending on where you live, I think you can find cheap short courses like this. http://www.city.ac.uk/courses/short-courses/introduction-to-data-analysis-and-machine-learning-with-python
What happens when the trial runs out?
I have used TkInter and PyQT and I wouldn't recommend either. They are both awful and creating even small stuff is quite a bit of a pain, I can't even imagine trying to create something more fancy on top of them. I really have no answers for you, sorry but I would consider you looking at frameworks from other languages with Python bindings or something like that because honestly, this is by far the only place where Python sucks a lot. Using HTML plus templating seems like a decent enough option but I don't think it quite fits what your project's idea seems to be. I have taken a quick look at the PyChess source code which is by far the prettiest Python UI I have ever seen and it seems to use [Glade](https://glade.gnome.org/) to leverage GTK, which is kinda what I was suggesting above. The game itself supports Windows and Linux so that's a plus too.
You can get them as a variable, use the get_frame method or a iterate over a sub clip: from moviepy.editor import * clip = VideoFileClip("original_file.mp4") new_frames = [ some_effect(frame) for frame in clip.iter_frames()] new_clip = ImageSequenceClip(new_frames, fps=clip.fps) new_clip.write_videofile("new_file.mp4") https://zulko.github.io/moviepy/ref/VideoClip/VideoClip.html
Right, that seems to be what it's intended for. But you're advertising here as if Gryd is some sort of new and novel solution, or that Jupyter couldn't run in the cloud before it came along...
Not in my case, because I already purchased my server hardware and I'm paying the electricity bill - I'm not willing to pay for a gryd account on top of that just because someone decided to offer preconfigured jupyter accounts instead of making the setup simpler. It might work out for people who only need a jupyter server, but e.g jupyter offerings on Azure like /u/uncommonguy mentioned have existed before, so gryd is no news.. It's just a second fish for the poor man instead of a fishing rod. I mean like ship default config for https plus per-user-service files for systemd with jupyter shouldn't be that hard - it's all documented and one single dev going through those docs would save all users from doing it themselfes. That alone would be such a big improvement with just a very little bit of work to do
thanks!
Flask is a great learning framework. It's starts very basic and you can get a webserver doing hello world in 'literally' 5 lines of code. http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.12/quickstart/
I think you might be correct on that one. 
you can use the Splinter library Install with: $ [sudo] pip install splinter and then use this code: from splinter import Browser browser = Browser('firefox') browser.visit('https://www.linkedin.com/') print(browser.html)
The quickest and simplest answer is: download Anaconda and install it. It comes with all scientific packages (including scipy) available for you. Or if you prefer to only install scipy, please download miniconda and after installing it, run conda install scipy
Good luck! Let me know if you get it :)
I'm actually trying to install keras, but scipy is a dependent and is what is causing the problem. I would love to use Anaconda, but I haven't been able to get it to work with tensorflow-gpu. I'm on day 3 of trying to get it to work unfortunately. 
I think this does not mean lxml.html (those were super fast already?)
why can't we dynamically construct the protocol buffers classes at runtime instead of generating them? why would I use this on my non-google-scale project? why is it better than REST+JSON?
Rpc guarantees types, does proper error handling, does binary streaming and handles connections etc that you don't get with rest. Ie I can make a server client interface in different languages if I want to and each can have the same guaranteed interface without me reinventing it in each language
The preferred mechanism in Python is to use properties. Here's [Properties vs. Getters and Setters](https://www.python-course.eu/python3_properties.php) an introduction.

I don't have access to a windows machine at the moment, but I suspect your best bet is to try installing the Anaconda python distribution. They maintain a repository of binaries for all platforms, with a focus on scientific computing libraries, so installing scipy should JustWork^TM. 
I would say that properties are best used when you want to provide an abstraction over code applied to an attribute. If your goal is basic, non-validating, direct access to a value, the Pythonic approach is to access the attribute directly.

Just wondering everyone's thoughts on how much longer programming will even be a thing. Very long term, we might not even use natural language anymore (kernel/Neuralink). There always seems to be lag with new technologies that programmers can take advantage of, such as programming web pages which is now 99% automated. Just looking at the direction Google and Microsoft are taking, they're making it easier and easier for people who have a profession other than programming to code. While an understanding of computer architecture appears to be invaluable, knowing how to use a plethora of computer langauges will be like knowing a plethora of natural language, almost totally useless. Everyone says we're not there yet and we won't be any time soon, but I wouldn't be surprised in the slightest if in 10 years 98% of programmers are out of a job
Just get the "unofficial" binaries of the Numpy and SciPy packages for Windows from [Christoph Gohlke's Python package repository](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/). Start with Numpy, then Scipy. Pick the correct wheel for your Python version, then `pip install` each file, i.e. using the full file names. These binaries are pre-compiled and linked against the linear-algebra backends (BLAS, LAPACK, MKL) which are missing on your machine. This is why installing from PyPI didn't work, since the compilation step failed.
I just stumbled into this subreddit and post with the same question as OP. Thank you for this.
Can I recommend you a Linux distro instead? Seriously though, for what you're describing I think Django is probably your best bet unless you're already quite familiar with SQLAlchemy, in which case Flask with the Flask-SQLAlchemy and Flask-Migrate packages is what I would recommend. Additionally, if you're this tied to Windows...you may just want to stick to C#. That's what I would do if I had to interface with an all MS stack.
If you want the objects to determine their position in the array, you would need a reference to the array in the objects themselves. I don't have full knowledge of what you are trying to build but, to my cursory understanding, it looks like you can accomplish the same thing without using OO constructs: Your rows become lists of raw state, then have a function that applies the relationships to the list instead of having each object manage its own relationships. Time for pseudocode... Compare: class Thing: def __str__(self): if self.next_object.color == 'red': return '(after red)=' + self.color else: return self.color def row_str(row): return ' '.join(str(t) for t in row) print(row_str([Thing('green'), Thing('red'), Thing('blue')])) # prints: 'green red (after red)=blue' To this: def elem_str(elem, p_elem, n_elem): if p_elem == 'red': return '(after red)=' + elem else: return elem def row_str(row): representations = [] for i, elem in enumerate(row): p_elem = row[i - 1] if i &gt; 0 else None n_elem = row[i + 1] if i + 1 &lt; len(row) else None representations.append(elem_str(elem, p_elem, n_elem)) print(row_str(['green', 'red', 'blue'])) # prints: 'green red (after red)=blue'
What's the reason? You need to show us the lines above

I have the verbose, would that help?
Thanks, this helps a lot!
Thank you, that worked!
`return` should do it. --- If you have more questions like this it's better to post them on /r/learnpython. Be sure to [format your code for reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/faq#wiki_how_do_i_format_code.3F) or use a site like pastebin. Also, include which version of python and what OS you are using. 
Then the problem is not where you think it is. You'll have to make some code that reproduces your problem and post it on /r/learnpython 
&gt; no lapack/blas resources found You need to fix this. I don't know what the resources are, but I'm sure you can Google. &gt; have the verbose What does this suppose to mean?
The verbose log used for debugging. Apparently lapack and blas are libraries used for high level mathmatical operations, which are essential to the operation of scipy. Unfortunately I have windows, which means getting them is a bitch and a half.
How though 
No to the Linux. If we're running Linux here, it will have to be CentOS, because that's what we do. I can install CentOS. I can't *do* anything practical with CentOS, especially with SELinux on, which burned me badly about nine years ago. No to the C#, since I don't know C#, and that means I would now have two variables in play.
If you don't have lapack/blas installed on your machine, then apparently verbose logging won't help... If I remember correctly there are scipy installers for Windows.
Solve problems people will pay for
Fyi: If possible, install packages with the distribution's package manager first (apt, yum, dnf, etc). If that prebuilt package doesn't suite your needs, then try pip in a python virtual environment. Pip can easily break software in your operating system. It can update or overwrite python modules that other software relies on. A python virtual environment will protect the python modules that are native to your distribution, modules installed via pip when using a python virtual environment will only be available when that virtual environment is active. 
Particularly on Windows, it's a lot easier to just install prebuilt NumPy and SciPy distributions via conda instead of pip. https://www.anaconda.com/download/
So it does seem like you have a webserver of some kind setup, but it probably doesn't know what to do with your file. When you visit any host name at that address you are sending it a 'request' on port 80. It's up to that machine to decide how to deal with it. Reddit sends back a user page for /u/keepdigging for example, but it could be configured to do anything really. You are probably coming at this from a php/apache angle where it's configured to serve files in a certain directory as they are re requested at the root hostname - /bob.html, /img/bg.png - apache is configured by default to just send those files if it sees them in it's folder and it's also requested. php might work the same way if it knows how to 'run' the php file and return the result. Your issue is that your webserver does not know how to do what you want when that file is requested.
Nice. I made a python script that does this with reddit submissions. It will display a realtime news feed from all news subreddits, and it has a pretty heavily set of rules to determine if its breaking news or not. It can also exclude certain submissions from the main news feed if I decide not to have it(like a news topic i'm not interrested in). If it detects breaking news, it will play a breaking news sound and read out loud the title using text to speech, with the option to submit it to a specific subreddit. Only thing I should really implement now is a duplicate checker to check URLs and similar titles. I can have it output to command line or a webpage in real time using AJAX.[ Here's a demo of that](https://streamable.com/fxxhd)(only its showing submissions from /r/all)
You can try to quickly write a php file that does something like "echo eval('python /location/filename.py');" Since your server might be set up to run php you can use it to run the python file. Getting apache or whatever server to run the python file and return its results directly is probably a bigger project for another day.
I added another reply to my comment
Probably! I am just trying to spitball you a quick solution from my phone, I'm a python dev and haven't touched php in years. I would test if your server can execute php with it's current config (probably) and then look up the documentation for php eval and try to get it to run your file like you are over ssh. I can help you get a server to run python natively another day. Be careful not to allow any user input to ever get inside an eval statement, you are letting php run a command on your machine so if you put user input they could escape it and take over your machine
I don't use apache, but it looks fine. Just work on it one step at a time. Get it to execute a php file and write a string to the generated HTML response Get the php file to execute your script and write what it returns to the response body I didn't read your script but if it takes longer than say 30s you might have a timeout issue. Good luck 
Youtube tutorials are really good sources. If you can grasp the basic concept of using objects/classes, it will greatly improve your ability to build a framework in which your game will run. There are a lot of ways you can approach problems in Python, which I find makes it feel like a very fun and productive language. If you give it enough time to sink in, you'll likely fall in love with python programming. Here's one good playlist that'll take you through some very good basics using PyGame: [Computer Game Development Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8E21BDD0981FDF66) 
Download the file you need from [here](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#scipy). It'll be one of scipy‑0.19.1‑cp34‑cp34m‑win_amd64.whl or scipy‑0.19.1‑cp35‑cp35m‑win32.wh depending on whether you want 64 or 32 bit. Edit:- spot the deliberate mistake, the second file should of course be scipy‑0.19.1‑cp34‑cp34m‑win32.whl. Moral of the story don't post when you're tired and a senile old git :-)
Please get the link that [u/Piu_Tevon](https://www.reddit.com/user/Piu_Tevon) gave you above deeply engrained into your head. In 17 years of usng Python the only problem I've had with code from the link was that it wasn't there in the first place :-)
Reminds me of the old one about the difference between people from the three services having to go. The RAF man would do everything by the drill book. In full dress uniform, trousers creased so that you could cut yourself on them, highly polished boots, he'd approach the door as if on the parade ground. Took ages but not a single movement (get it :-) was wrong. The RN man would saunter up swinging his handbag and did things his way. The army man would rush up and once sat down feel extremely relieved until he remembered that he hadn't pulled his trousers down.
I use json hyperschema to define and document my api, with runtime type checking. The browser already pools connection. I haven't done much with streaming over http bc I usually just use websockets for that. Json isn't a very efficient encoding although it compresses pretty well. But I suppose for high performance apps you might want a native binary encoding.
Very cool! Thanks for sharing. 
Don't stress about that too much. Whatever decision you make, it'll be wrong, and that's ok (it's just part of the learning process).
You can use QML to deploy to android or ios. I use PyQt to test my QML code because python is more lightweight than using Qt Creator, then when I want to test on my android phone I copy/paste the code to Creator and use that to deploy. It almost feels like it's cheating because it's so easy. 
Hi, I'm working on a segment in a book series on Python. The current segment is called "Functional Python." 
Json hyoerschema isn't necessarily part of the language, it's an addition that relies on varying libraries on each platform. RPCs are typically c extensions but you largely get the same behavior across multiple languages. Browser pooling is fine, but rpcs are best suited for applications. You can use them for browsers but it's not as much of a gain. Another thing is that with an rpc you deal with objects. Ie I can have objects with methods that translate to any language that supports such a structure. By using an rpc, you are defining the client API, the server API and the client server interface at once. It's very useful. Things that would take maybe 30minutes to a few hours to define in a rest/json take a minute or two in rpc in my experience Granted my experience is with the zeroc ice rpc and not grpc but they're very similar
jupyterhub?
The choice of framework is not necesarily Windows specific. As long as the framework is WSGI compliant you should be OK. The others already recommended Pyramid, Flask, and Django. Choose your poison. My favorite is Flask+SQLAlchemy but that' irrelevant. Then for WSGI serving part you can use [wfastcgi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/wfastcgi). It is developed by Microsoft and it integrates with IIS via FastCGI Another option for the WSGI on Windows is Twisted with iocp reactor. It does work, I've had such a setup running for years but it is somewhat harder to configure initially.
Nice work /u/jhayes88
As Iwan_Zotow said, what you are looking for is jupyterhub. And for example here is a Zero to full install on GCP using kubernete that any one could follow http://zero-to-jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ If you are already using docker, then you just need to follow the instructions and choose a few options (like auth, storage, CPU/Mem limits) and you're good to go. It is, yes, harder than wordpress but we're speaking arbitrary code execution; so it's harder to setup securely. And also it's provided for free ; so use case that have more documentation and more simple to set up are the once that volunteers developing the code care about. Maybe a couple of PR could make your use case way simpler, and be helpful for many ! 
I've been getting started with writing scripts for things that I do on my computer daily. I need help though with the gui libraries and how to do things on Chrome through console. For example, closing a message box on Facebook the instant it pops up. 
Thanks!
Try to set User-Agent so it would be same as in browser request. Sometimes servers vary the response by user agent. Can also be cookies.
You might find *requests* module more convenient
I am currently trying to make a modern day enigma. I feel as if I am biting off more then I can chew, due to this being my first project. I have a lot of learning to do. 
&gt; Hey, I've had to do a couple python rebuilds over the past few months. I've no idea what you mean by that, please explain.
The problem with this type of question is that it's all subjective, hence why it would be rejected on SO. Despite that why not try [wxPython](https://www.wxpython.org/).
No, I only posted here and on /r/learnprogramming. Next time I will post it to /r/learnpython instead. I did not realize there were separate subreddits. 
Are you talking about building python from source? This is what i install for dependencies in Ubuntu (tested in 14.04 &amp; 16.04): - build-essential - python-dev - libreadline-dev - libssl-dev - libbz2-dev - build-essential - sqlite3 - tk-dev - libsqlite3-dev - libc6-dev - libgdm-dev - libncurses-dev - libgdbm-dev - liblzma-dev Then, if I'm using MySQL or mariadb: libmysqlclient-dev I have a list for rhel6/7 too, but I'm not confident that it is all inclusive, since I'm working on machines that already have a lot installed on them already.
is your caps lock broken?
Try a newline character? \n
Probably not. But increasing the speed of all the find methods "significantly" is great news for me.
Sorry, I don't see any \n in the print statements quotes. Kind of hard to read on mobile.
Just so we are clear it is '\n' You should put it where ever you want a new line.
&gt; I've had to do a couple python rebuilds over the past few months. What? Are you building from source or installing packages? Why are you "rebuilding" so often?
Print """&lt;a...&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n""".format(line=line) But it has to be an \ to escape the newline character, thus """\n""". I believe...
You should **not** have to worry about that. The print statement implies a newline character. That is not a solution.
What python version are you running? What OS are you using?
 Uh, okay odd question. Are you viewing the output in a browser? If so, use a &lt;br&gt; break, html stuff... same spot as where I said to put the \n...
okay good. Are the lines of "sstream.csv" separated by newline characters? I know this sounds dumb, but it sounds like your loop is only running once.
 Yup, confident this is what you need now. Either wrap you links in &lt;p&gt; paragraph tags or add a &lt;br&gt; break after every link to force a new line in your html output.
Print """&lt;a...&gt;&lt;\a&gt;&lt;br&gt;""".format(line=line)
Are they separated by *linux* newline characters? Run this: with open("sstream.csv") as f: print repr(f.read()) It could be that they are separated by a carriage return characters ("\r") instead of newline characters ("\n" or "\r\n") if the csv file was originally created on a different OS.
A php file starts like... &lt;?php Echo eval('python path/to.py');
If your python or python evaluation php script is in the same directory as your wordpress, it may have problems.
Math libraries (e.g. numpy &amp; scipy), plotting (matplotlib), and good desktop GUI programming (pySide/PyQt).
Hehe, I'm a php dev that hasn't touched python in a few months... agreed on eval, try to avoid. In other news, check if bluehost will run python as a cgi script... I can't remember off the top of my head if they do that.
It's type annotations introduced in Python 3. See: http://mypy-lang.org/. It's harmless, meaning the interpreter ignores them, but it works nicely as documentation and there's a CLI tool to do static analysis, just like [flake8](http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/).

What "errors"? What website? Can you describe your goal in more detail? Also, this is probably a question for /r/learnpython.
all errors in any websites
What do you mean by "errors"? Malformed HTML? Error responses? Security vulnerabilities? What exactly are you trying to achieve?
Learning python still, but I’m making a blackjack game. The version I just made doesn’t have Q, J , K, or A. So I’m gonna implement that eventually once I figure it how to make that work.
errors of the page
Can you give an example of an "error of the page"?
&gt; Design your classes first. That is, write out the class name and methods, and just put pass for all the definitions. This could be a bit hard for a beginner.
ike this google page error : Failed to load resource: net::ERR_FAILED
Fuck, dude. Step 1: read the sidebar. Step 2: go to the correct sub. Step 3: Read that sub's sidebar.
This isn't an error on Google's website, that just means your computer failed to connect to Google. Is that what you're trying to detect?
&gt; How do I start? /r/learnpython/wiki &gt; What should I learn first? The book/course/whatever you use to learn will tell you. &gt; What can I do with Python? Anything. &gt; Can you guys recommend any Websites or YT channels that gives free Python training etc.? /r/learnpython/wiki
yeah ,i know that I want this errors like things
So you want to know if your computer can connect to Google? What is your end goal here?
yes.
Then you can just use `requests`. import requests try: requests.get('https://google.com/') except: print("Can't connect to Google")
no, i want splinter code
Is that a homework assignment or what? I'm not going to do your work for you. Have you tried anything at all? What? Does it work? If it doesn't, what's the error? Post your code _and_ the exact error message.
no that is my work ,if you anger at me, do not reply me,okay

I just started web scraping (decided it's time to give up on a certain notes/journal website which hasn't implemented an export function in 3+ years I've been using it, but I don't want to lose the wealth of stuff I'd saved on it), and I'm using selenium and beautiful soup. Selenium helps me log in, and beautiful soup takes care of recognizing the data I want. Haven't implemented saving to an actual file yet, though.
Yes
Thanks, just wanted to check that for the code underneath 'Here is some code for you...'.
 &gt; Another thing is that with an rpc you deal with objects. Ie I can have objects with methods that translate to any language that supports such a structure. Not so much with gRPC. You get code generation for your protobuf types and the RPC stubs, but you cannot add methods to the protobufs, and deriving from them to add methods is something all the docs discourage. Still, though, you do get strong types and streaming, async capable RPCs. It's a nice toolkit. Edit: quoted correct paragraph
You should be able to skate by on Heroku’s free plan. 
Check http://lxml.de/lxmlhtml.html, it's a lot faster than Beautiful Soup
BS4 uses 'lxml' if you tell it to
[removed]
Scrapy is pretty nice
Doesn't the Dyno sleep after 30 minutes of inactivity? I'm not asking to shoot down your suggestion, but because I've also been searching for a 24/7 box.
Scrapy is great if the pages you are scraping are well-structured, but BeautifulSoup is a must-have if you're trying to find data in a - dare I say it - soup of markup + text.
https://regex101.com/ also has great python support
And the opposite is possible too :) Cf: http://lxml.de/lxmlhtml.html#really-broken-pages
This might be a bit off topic but i have previously automated tests using chromedriver and selenium. I have used flags similar to this: options.add_argument("--disable-bundled-ppapi-flash") profile = {"plugins.plugins_disabled": ["Shockwave Flash"]} My tests have been able to play videos on websites using those settings (i assume without flash). I was trying out puppeteer today with a chromium browser instead. It stops me from playing those same movies and claims that i need flash. Do you have any idea why? Do i need to set flags for the chromium browser as well? Thanks for any possible help. Edit: Seems chromium doesn't have H.264 support. This might be causing the problem for me. So annoying.
You can use Scrapy Cloud from Scrapinghub (https://scrapinghub.com/scrapy-cloud). There is a free plan that you can use to run your spiders, and you can configure your scrapper to send the data the way you want. It is a platform ready for running scrapers, so you will have the 24/7 desired.
Do you mean coding problems as part of the interview process? Would you mind posting some details on the kind of things they are asking you to do?
Wow, good luck. Some insights into what they ask you would be good to know

Cambridge, UK: Teraview Ltd. is looking for a scientific python developer to grow their team developing terahertz instrumentation for scientific and industrial applications. Job Spec here: https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/146556/instrumentation-software-engineers-python-teraview-ltd 
+1 for Enaml. This framework is very well designed. We build highly complex GUIs for scientific instrumentation and it's working very well for us. Atom, the observer/object framework which it uses is also awesome and very useful in its own right - we have our instrument-control code (non-GUI) based on this. Enaml is a declarative language for designing a GUI. It uses PyQt internally. The nice thing is that when you want a feature not yet implemented in Enaml (e.g. Tree control), you can integrate custom PyQt widgets very easily.
On the left, 100%. On the right: possibly, but most likely not
https://www.pythonanywhere.com/ seems okay for what you are looking to achieve.
Always been a fan of digitalocean or AWS. 
Try placing the chromedriver executable in the same directory you have the script you are running, then: from selenium import webdriver driver = webdriver.Chrome(executable_path='./chromedriver.exe')
As others have said, the code on the left is certainly Python. Some indications of this are `from ... import ...`, `def`, decorators and doc-strings. It seems to be the default Visual Studio Flask file. For the code on the right, however, it's not so clear. Syntactically, it is valid Python. However, the formatting (indents) is not common to Python code, and the functions `Concat`, `SubStr` and `ConstStr`don't exist in Python, unless the user defined them beforehand. Also, function names are normally all lowercase in Python. I think if it looked like this it would be more convincing Python code: sub1 = substr(x, 'Alphanumeric', -1) sub2 = substr(x, 'ALL CAPS', 1) concat(sub1, ', ', sub2, conststr('.')) Although like I said, the three functions would still not be familiar to Python programmers. In fact concatenation is normally done using [`join`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.join). But I'm not able to find a language that has these three functions built-in, so it seems like just a quick bit of demo code in a non-existent language.
I use : Topcoder, codechef and project Euler 
+1 here regex101 is the best!
Ok, I've heard of Saint-Venant though I'm not very familiar with it.
Yes, and sure. Three companies gave me tasks to complete from home. These are the python-relevant parts. **Company A**: Write a program that simulates sort of a game. Reading specified commands from input and doing something according to them. Moving in a world more or less. Unit tests and test cases were expected as well. This one was quite time restrictive. **Company B**: Write a program that does some processing on large files. Think log parsing and doing some analysis on it. Command line arguments, unit tests were expected. I didn't care about memory performance as the logs were not sorted by time and I had to read all of them to do my processing anyway. **Company C**: Series of tasks of various complexity. Writing a simple text processing functions, writing a decorator that takes arguments, writing a class that represents a "number-like" data type (lots of __), a context manager, extending an existing base class along with writing tests for it using specific library.
no ... i thought grabbing the latest version of python should be most efficient ... what version do you recommend?

I’m not sure on this as I just started using bs4, but doesn’t it default to lxml?
Seems the code on the left is the same as on this blog: http://developer.e-power.com.kh/how-to-create-default-template-in-flask/ . The bit in the chat _could_ be Python but almost certainly isn't. It smells like some sort of .Net or even SQL to me.
Ahh regex. The only place “made easy”, “python”, and “part #16” can be unironically combined. 
They are working on a flask application. Yes, Python
Interesting thanks
I like beautiful soup because I can write html queries the way I think about them. I've been using it for a long time, so it feels natural. Other libraries do it differently but all the ones named so far are fully featured and nice to use. Scrapy, lxml. I also like a little library called mechanical soup that adds some html form and cookie handling pretty easy. Its not extremely featureful but gets out of the way.

`sudo apt install python3`, don't build it
No, it doesn't default to it. You first have to install `lxml` then do`soup = BeautifulSoup(url, 'lxml')` Edit: however, most people are transitioning to 'html5lib' instead of 'lxml'. But it's really dealers choice, or what kind of data you're looking at. 
/r/learnpython It also helps if you just post what you need help with, perhaps it's something someone can point you in the direction of a tutorial or something :) Help us to help you!
If you're dealing with currency, use the `decimal` module. Floats in Python 3 are [still just C `double`s](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#typesnumeric), meaning they're subject to all the usual IEEE 754 issues.
You can't just learn the data science without learning the rest of the language.
&gt; You can't just learn the data science without learning the rest of the language. You could say the doesn't need to understand OOP fully to become a data scientist.
You'll have to understand some, but not all of it. Really hard to say, but you should start learning using a book/tutorial on Data Analysis that covers the basics for Python as well. While it's a bit outdated, I recommend http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920023784.do, it's by the author of the Pandas library. Finally, you should post this question to /r/learnpython
I only skimmed the article, but just to be clear if others do not know, Wes McKinney is the main author of Pandas. Certainly gives some credence to what he says. ([wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wes_McKinney))

Yeah that can be annoying. Check for zip and readline those tend to drop if your build environment isn't correct. Perhaps also for any math libraries but that is less fo a concern until you get into installing numpy.
Python 3 uses the IEEE Floating point system for 'floats' objects - therefore it still is not suitable for currency - Either use the Decimal library (and initialise with a string) or do your currency calculations in pennies/cents etc - and only convert to $,£ etc when you do display.
*Always* use the decimal module when precision is more important than performance.
&gt; Seems like most articles/concerns were on 2.7 which handled things differently. Umm, no? https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/floatingpoint.html https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/floatingpoint.html This is just a basic fact of IEEE 754 floats. This transcends language, transcends compilers, OS, system, processor, whatever. If it uses IEEE 754, it's going to have the same issues, and most processors have the hardware to support IEEE 754, so it's pretty common. I know I'm being a tad rude, but on the other hand, how hard did you look? The Python 3 document straight up states: &gt; For use cases which require exact decimal representation, try using the decimal module which implements decimal arithmetic suitable for accounting applications and high-precision applications.
The code on the right looks like SQL, or some sort of query language. As others have said, left is Python
nearlyfreespeech.net google cloud platform free tier 
Why does it need to run 24/7? Or do you mean once every hour? Do you really need a whole operating system and all that? Why not put it in an AWS Lambda function and trigger it with a recurring Event? Will probably stay in the free tier, but even if it wouldn't it'll only cost a few cents per month.
Raspberry Pi?
Also, if you're using IPython (and if you're not, check it out), you can type %matplotlib to be able to keep working.
Most of it was Python. They also showed some R
Thanks. Any guidelines on how to do so? What standard does Excel use?
[Read the docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/decimal.html). Excel, as is common with early Microsoft products, [does some weird shit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numeric_precision_in_Microsoft_Excel).
trying to make a plotly wrapper for weighted fully connected networkx graphs. can't get the weighted edges tho 
I'd give pyquery a try if you're used to dealing with jQuery.
This is nice, but it seems like a wrapper for selenium and nose or pyunit. What sets it apart from frameworks that are already out there?
You can have a monitoring system set up that pings it every couple of seconds, making it awake 24/7. That's how I did it anyway
Does it run ladder logic?
Yeah, bs4 is a pretty souped up library.
A toolkit for more streamlined RPG-style game development without being limited to any single set of tools (eg. Pygame or PySDL2)
I assume its value add is the GUI/dashboard/test editor.
The main benefit to me is that it comes -ready to use- with a lot of features. The GUI module should be useful for helping people without a lot of programming knowledge get started with test automation. The Report module is also nice to have, giving visibility for everyone in the team is important. I'm adding support for API and mobile testing. It would be nice to have different types of tests inside a single tool. But thanks for the question!
Yea. Beware, you may stuck in a polite recursion if you choose wrong response for 'bless you'
I'm building a simple solar tracker for my Home Automation system that will track many aspects of Solar time and do fun things at different events (Solar Noon, Midnight, Civil Sunrise, Nautical Dusk, etc.). Having a blast with Python!
A trading bot. It have made some successful order for the last few day. "Success" as accepted order by exchange and not throwing error, but not success at generating profit consistently.
why python? imo if you are interacting with the browser, it's native language is the one of choice. instead of reinventing the wheel, why not build a full featured framework that generates boilerplate from gherkin and spits out graphical reports with metrics on time and bandwith consumption? Edit: holy shit this sub is militant pro python. Don't even bother questioning it. Unsubbed
Data pipeline on Spark. I am really new to programming industry (6 months), but this work is exciting. And I am actually good at it.
Lambda would be better if it's just code and not web facing app. 
Docker monitoring via cloudwatch and reporting metrics to slack. And some aws automation with boto3.
What would be native language of the browser? Javascript? This tool uses Selenium, which has bindings for a lot of languages. The choice of language for end to end tests generally is that it should be the same as the language used by the development team, ie, if your team uses java to develop the app under test, use java to write the end to end tests. While I don't disagree with this. The end to end tests (Selenium) interact with the DOM, there's no interaction between the e2e tests and the code of the App under test. Therefore, you should choose the language based on other factors, hence... Python
I don't think I follow...
I'm building a couple of APIs with DRF. One is for a personal project and one is for work. The personal project is for my personal home management site, which includes a chore list, a library, a simple expenses report, and a few other things.
I am actually new to Python (Java, C#, Web dev., etc. previously) and I just started with "Automate the Boring Stuff With Python" last night. The challenge seems to be the difference in syntax. I hope to eventually be working on some projects to share, but I guess we all have to start somewhere!
Working on learning Python! I've always been interested but never knew how to start. I'm diving in this week. 
PowerShell? Are you trying to run Python code inside PowerShell?
Yes, is there a problem? I've been doing this for almost a year now
Are you running the Python interpreter in PowerShell, or are you trying to run the code directly inside PowerShell? Can you post the exact error message?
Python interpreter inside of power shell File "add.py" , line 12 return b #b = 100,94,90 ^ SyntaxError: invalid character in identifier Edit: organization 
Your code [works fine for me](https://repl.it/LeWq/0). Are you sure there are no special characters or anything in your file?
If you need help, let me know I might be able to lend a hand. Also, you should check out the reporting module used in Robot Framework. Maybe save some time when expanding the robustness of the reporting engine.
positive, I guess the error is running it through powershell and not the code itself, good to know. thanks! Edit: also nice to know I had the wrong values of b 94 should be 74
the choice of language for end to end tests doesn't matter at all. like you said the e2e tests interact with the DOM alone, they don't care about the language of the codebase. i wrote an entire testing framework in javascript. its being used to test a legacy c# app, as well as a modern javascript one. your framework looks simple and clean, i was just wondering about the motivation to use python, instead of evolving something like protractor to be fully featured, more idiomatic. 
Finished codeacademy 3 weeks ago. Now I am digesting my way through learn python the hard way. Really enjoying it! I have a background in product/industrial design. Know some about HTML &amp; CSS and I have touched Java a tiny bit. This is my first OOP language. Question: what do you usually complement Python with?
"Automate the boring stuff" I need to look in to this after I am done with my current lecturing.
Wikipedia offers [an API](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page), and there are several python packages already made to implement that API. [For instance this one](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/wikipedia/). It will be much easier for you and much nicer for wikipedia if you use that. --- If you have more questions like this it's better to post them on /r/learnpython.

A PyQt program for work. We have a program that lets us keep track of configuration changes to our vehicles, but it was made using Excel...and it cost a lot. I'm making this for free and with better features. It probably won't get approved, but so is life working in the government. They're set in their ways.
I'm what you would probably call a layman when it comes to systems programming (anything touching C/C++). But I'll be damned if I didn't get genuinely excited reading this. Arrow sounds fantastic...so what's the catch? Is it just the added operational overhead, adding a separate data access layer; but if you're using even a couple of the [systems mentioned](http://arrow.apache.org/img/shared2.png) it should be an incredible improvement...
your code reads : return b #b = 100,94,90 You can't have a # in an identifier, and you can't have an '=' in a return (i.e. you can't assign during a return) - you can test for equality : return a == 'Hello' would return True or False depending on the value of a
It was commented out for the purpose of keeping track, but I just took it out and the same Syntax error was raised
I'm working on a reddit bot in Flask, leveraging a free pythonanywhere account. This is my first web app. I'm trying to get "Marvin help" to work to better understand how to create and deploy web apps in Python/Flask. I'm stuck at the moment with OAuth.
I think so. One time cost, super cheap, and fun!
Sorry, it's just I'm used to running ladder logic for automated systems inside factories. But you're probably saying automation in just making things automatic. 
I suppose it's an extra piece of software to maintain in a big-data environment, but I think the idea of Arrow as "columnar data middleware" is a fantastic (though admittedly un-sexy) innovation.
I'm doing a major refactor on my venerable IRC bot. I'm trying to get all of the IRC related socket functions into their own library so that I can reuse them at will. I'm also trying (and not being terribly successfu) to design a decent plugin API for all of the non-core bot functionality.
They're not comparable. One is just a wrapper around parsers that give you a DOM, and the other one is a full scraping framework: scrapers, downloaders, serializers, test frameworks, etc. Sure, they preclude each other, but their target segments are different. Don't use Scrapy for nice interactive scrapers.
And it allows you to use XPath, which is quite convenient for some more annoying queries that the CSS selector single-pass model doesn't make possible.
What would you want to do with your 24/7 box, and why must it be 24/7?
also a trading bot...successfully implemented TA-lib and getting cryptodata in...now the fun part starts :D
Why avoid `curses`? You're basically reimplementing it anyway, and for no good reason.
Just as a challenge to myself, I thought doing this would be a worthwhile task and educational to boot. I don't see any reason why creating a library similar to curses in pure python is a bad idea, or even impossible. I'm simply trying to do what I can. The same argument can be applied to many libraries in Python. "If it's already done in C, why redo it in Python?", in my personal opinion, defeats the purpose of doing anything in Python at all.
Then you should probably use `select` to check if there is data available in stdin.
Decimal is still a floating point type – it's just represented in base 10 rather than base 2. You can't represent 1/3 exactly with finite precision in base 10 any more than you can in base 2. In that case, and many others where exactness is required, Fraction is a better number type to use. The important thing is to understand the engineering tradeoffs involved in selecting a number type for a particular application.
I'll take another look at this, but without being able to see how many bytes are readable in stdin, I've exhausted my knowledge. I appreciate your suggestion though and will try my best to try it out.
Decent. Would you like to share? 
That is exactly what `select` will tell you.

Testing my machine learning library by training a recurrent neural network to generate coherent text based on a particular US politician's campaign speeches.
I wrote it mainly for my own use, but others may find it helpful. The idea is to run one script, and end with a shortcut to a self-contained venv with the Scipy stack. On Windows, it downloads Scipy and Numpy+MKL wheels from Chris Gohlke's site. (Scipy doesn't install with Pypi, and CG's Scipy requires his Numpy as well), then the rest from Pypi.
It seems, in-fact, `select` can not do this. It only returns a list. And in my tests, only empty lists.
So, what advantage does this have over RobotFramework?
Just whipped up a tiny script to monitor the Twitter accounts I'm interested in and then use Twilio to send their tweets to my phone as SMS. This way I don't have to install Twitter on my phone or see any of the garbage fire stuff while trying to check what I want.
That means that there is no tag "iframe", so None is returned.

Yeah, well I think this is stage one of many stages of the interview process. I'll try to write up what they asked me and all that. I'm interviewing for a hardware test engineer position, but they want people who are very good with Python. I'm not an amazing Python coder, but I know enough to probably pass these interviews when added to my test engineer experience.
Debugging in your browser? Many (probably most) webpages use javascript to dynamically generate html code. The code you have gets the source code but does not run the javascript. If that's the case you will need to find out where the javascript gets it's data and look there, or get an engine to run the javascript, or use `selenium` to automate your web browser. 
RobotFramework is more generalistic. With Golem you write the tests using python code instead of plain txt files. Golem comes with a long list of predefined functions to automate actions in web applications. Golem has a GUI module.
Are you looking for code critique? /r/learnpython is a much better place for that.
I agree. It would be nice to have the option of writings the tests in either Python or Javascript, since Js is so popular these days. Although, I would rather use WebDriverJs instead of Protractor as it is closer to python
Yeah thats right i will Post it there

Such a shiny and lively piece of bait your trolling there for us to bite onto. I'm ignoring the grammar and syntax mistakes, and assuming your problem is that your gang isn't getting any members that are above 7 cool, and somehow, there's a bunch of neeks making it in with primark. Seems like this is caused by an erroneous conditional, where cool &lt;= 7 is allowing neeks in and excluding the really sik bruvs
Subsequently saw the Microsoft demo at Ignite, where a Microsoft exec described the code in the right-hand panel as pseudo code. The chap demoing the bot said this pseudo code was generated by the bot, not sure what exactly he means by that as I presumed it'd been extracted from a previous Stack Overflow question. For anyone who's interested the Ignite demo is available at about 7 hours and 21 minutes in in this video: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ignite

There is no reason to use the lxml HTML parser, it's outdated and terrible (it's a hand-rolled HTML4 parser) Use the html5lib parser instead. You can do so with both lxml and BS4.
why pay $10/mo so you can pay $5/mo to digitalocean. it's already brain dead simple to use.
&gt; however, most people are transitioning to 'html5lib' instead of 'lxml'. They are orthogonal choice, you can use lxml for the API and use the html5lib parser. In fact it's a pretty damn good choice.
I'll admit, years ago when I was looking there was a shortage till somebody gave me a bunch of great links. I cannot find that documentation any more. I have some code for a really simple little app that I abandoned after a bit, but it all works, and it looks pretty good. Rudiementary, but from it you'll be able to get going. It's ancient, far from good code, but it's all I can really share. Maybe this is useful: https://github.com/dfmeyer/AmarokRemote

This is the wrong answer. Some of us need to build intepreters for various reasons. 
But the reason at hand is not one of those various reasons I believe.
Rust. It's rather trivial to write a Python library in Rust, and the performance of the language is really close to C and C++ equivalents while also being inherently memory- and type-safe. On the other hand, C# and C++ are also great choices if using the IronPython implementation.

Totally fair, but since OP didn't give a reason there's a high chance they should just use apt 
No there isnt, thats fallacious. A reason wasnt provided, you have nothing to back that up one way or the other.

Ah! It pains my heart whenever I see the global keyword used. Also repetitive code that could be shortened Into a for loop. All the tk.Button() calls can be shortened to 3 lines as a nested for loop or 2 lines with itertools.product.

Learn the basics, solve business problems, always keep learning.
By passing the codes to an APR DRG grouper (supplied by 3M) you are able to get a Risk of Mortality score between 1-4. Unfortunately it is pay per request, and gets expensive. Sounds like an interesting project.
Internalize the standard library. Yes you can look things up. No you cannot program at an elite level by not knowing the basics of the language. Write a lot of python code. Read a lot of python code. Check out open source libraries for top projects in python. Understand the code to the point that you can critique it and improve it. 
&gt; Please be original, don't make whatever example app you will build a blog or a todo... the world has seen enough todo and blog tutorial apps. :) this! I am tired of seeing blog apps and these other simple apps. If possible you should look into making tutorial on a membership website series like this - https://www.codingforentrepreneurs.com/projects/srvup-2/ That's in Django but I would love to see a Flask implementation of the same.
If you think you might find some other uses for it, it might be worth getting a raspberry pi or something similar.
&gt;Could you outline a path/roadmap into learning the concepts to master it in cyber security No one is going to do that - this should be part of the work that YOU do to understand the depth of the field. Plus, this doesn't have anything to do with Python per se. You have years of research and practice ahead of you. You get better at Python by practicing Python. 
thanks for the heads up, I'll look into that! do you know which codes/ features are they using? i'm doing this as a nano degree project for machine learning and i've been querying the Mimic III database for lab, chart and demographic data and then just TORTURING it trying to get something that works better than just predicting survival every time! 
Depends what you're making, personally I think knowing the ins and outs of JavaScript if pretty handy. As in my opinion most people want to show collected collected data on a website
Sounds cool, is it anywhere I could follow?
That's quite nice for those concerned about privacy and social media too
Yea, I did. Please correct me if I'm missing something, but it doesn't seem like there is any way to adapt `select` for my current use case. Let me ask you this; have you?
Nice job. I will give it a try and see what happens. Anything that might make testing better is awesome.

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3762881/how-do-i-check-if-stdin-has-some-data
Where in that do you see anything about the number of characters readable from `stdin`? I've already read this SO question at least 10 times. That's why I came here. I have exhausted all other resources.
You don't need the number of characters, you just need to know if there are any characters left.
Please help me to understand how this could be done in practice, because as far as I can tell, this method serves me no purpose. I've shared the relevant code in the hastebin. If you wouldn't mind, please show me where in my code this method would even be applicable. So far, in my various tests with select, it only makes it less reliable.
I haven't started the image thing yet, and the bot is private as it currently has some sensitive info in it. Maybe someday
Read one character. Use `select` to see if there's more. If there isn't, you got an Escape key press. If there is, keep reading and decide whether it's Escape followed by a different key or a special key sequence.
`select` alone is not enough; the pseudo-terminal device that you're likely using is probably in canonical mode, which buffers *lines*. See [the tty demistified](http://www.linusakesson.net/programming/tty/) and the `termio(3)` man page.
That depends on your level of competency with the platform, and whether you chose the right tools for the job. It's like asking an Arch Linux user to go from his distro that doesn't completely screw up Python packaging, to use Amazon Linux images on EC2.
You may or may not have read the code in the [hastebin](https://hastebin.com/ovajicogoc.py), but I set the terminal to `raw mode`. The shell then no longer handles any keys on its own and my script is left with the requirement of handling key presses.
Agreed. If there is a single open source developer to whom I literally owe my career it would be Wes. If he's in with Arrow, then I trust his judgment.
What are you using Rust for?
A choose your own adventure game! It’s all text based at the moment. Still very new to python but I’m enjoying it and am learning lot just by doing this. Just the simple stuff like having an inventory and creating a simple combat system are fun problems to overcome.

I'm writing machine learning trading tools that work with streaming data. When we work with static dataframes it's pretty easy to get 90%+ prediction accuracy, I want to see if I can get that to hold with live data.
I see where I got this now. On MY system ( Ubuntu ) if I do t specify a parser it uses the “ best one for my system” which is lxml. Sorry for the confusion.
Pandas sucks (imo). It doesn't follow pythonic conventions and has pretty bad documentation. A lot of new concepts and classes are introduced with very little theory and explanation about how to think about them. I just use Numpy and call it a day...
Also, learning computer science is important to understand what lies underneath python. 
Building my first RESTful API with Flask and Swagger. 
Hello, is there a documentation of some sort for this? Currently doing "Automate the boring stuff" projects with selenium, but I used selenium to write tests in C# for a small company, but never fully understood all the concepts since I don't have any CS degree. If this can help make my life easier, I want to give it a try. And also I'm curious to learn how this works. Thanks for sharing this! 
If you mean installing Qt Creator, unfortunately I don't have a magic trick to get it to work. It was a pain in the ass. I basically followed the [Qt Docs](http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/androidgs.html) and troubleshooted the errors that occured. My system is Ubuntu, I found it easier to use Creator on that than on Windows even though the Windows version comes pre-built with MinGW but I couldn't figure out how to do it on Windows. [This link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42041461/install-android-sdk-without-studio-on-linux-for-qt-creator) also helped me getting it to run.
All work at the moment. Django updates is important but before that can progress: sphinx docs, fabric-based toolchain, behave framework, tests, fixtures for tests. It's been a busy few weeks! If that all goes well it's time for a more SOA approach to the architecture and configuration manglement before christmas.
Thanks all! I ended up using requests + bs4, did the job well (scraping newspaper sites for spesific news).
What particularly makes it more difficult to get accurate predictions on live dat than a static dataset?
So, basically old school twitter lol
For this project I'm not using Quantopian, so a lot of the issue is getting the live data in a useful format and updating the test/train data every so often to make useful predictions.
This wasn't about cute pandas at all. I feel taken advantage of. 
Heroku works well as a REST API server, IMO. See if the free dyno suits your needs, even if it isn’t 24/7. 
My main gripe with pandas is the type instability of functions. For example, they return a list of strings **unless** there is only one, then they return a bare string. Makes it very hard to extend.

How is that book? Do you recommend it?
is it only for web applications? can tests be written for desktop apps?
If you like web development, Flask is pretty cool. If you want to do something simpler, I've had a lot of fun with basic libraries -- you can scrape some websites and generate csvs with the data, build a sql database with some data that interests you (anything you can think of, sports scores, quotes, stock market info, etc). 
Getting useful data always seems to be the hardest part.
I currently use Sublime, it's fast and has some nice plugins etc. In the past I've used Atom, PyCharm, Geany, Komodo, Notepad++, etc. Before Sublime I was using VisualStudio Code and I actually really like it.
I started with Beautiful Soup but I've had a lot more luck with Selenium for scraping more modern JS heavy sites. I'm not a scraping expert though so it's possible that I'm doing things the hard way.
Looks like GraphAttack not GraphAttach.
I was giving PyCharm a go and I liked how I could run my code without having to save it as a file first. Is that what people mean when they say IDE? And OK, just visited that sub and it looks really helpful.

What do you intend to generate when you mention boilerplate from gherkin?
I'm looking for a framework that will allow me to take some existing, stand-alone scripts I have for regression testing and allow me to integrate them into scheduled tests and reports. Would golem allow me to do that?
&gt; I'm using a one-second sleep here, but in real code you would start with a smaller delay and use exponential back-off. Won't this punish tasks that are early to the draw on an empty bucket and reward tasks that are late to the draw? Does it make more sense to load requests (even in coroutine form) in a queue and empty it at a sustained pace? 
check out the cucumber-selenium library. it takes the gherkin language commonly used to articulate coding work and generates boilerplate which makes them the criteria for actual tests. you just fill in the actual test code, instead of all the boilerplate and test code.
Thanks, I'll look into that 
oh, you mean the function definitions for the step implementation, backing the actual gherkin? PyCharm Pro + Behave does this too. Just trying to clarify
I am just getting started, but from a quick overview of it, I think it is going to be excellent. It has a lot of practical things to learn and program, which is a step ahead of a lot of programming books.

Bad documentation compared to what? It is definitely incomplete in many cases, but bad is a stretch. It is lightyears ahead of many other packages. As with anything, there are trade offs.

I think learning scala made me a better programmer in general. You can learn go in a weekend and see if you think its worth continuing with.
I use Vim. I don't recommend you learn to program *and* learn Vim at the same time, though. I also don't recommend that you pick up and use an IDE like PyCharm while learning to program.
Julia is promising for what it could become. It looks a lot like Python.
Python is very popular among DIY groups and hardware hackers. That's why I wanted to learn it. That's also how I stayed motivated. Think about something you want to build. Raspberry Pi's are pretty much the best friend of any hardware hacker. Here are a few things *I* would be interested in doing: * Make your room smart - Did you know that since Google released the Assistant SDK, you can make a DIY Google Home? Did you know that your DIY Google Home could run Alexa as well? At the *same* time? This is something that I would be down to do. Seeed Studios sells a far field microphone array that you could hook up to a Pi, and that would make your "Google Home" have just as good of a mic as a real one. Of course, that wouldn't be super cool - it's just a Home that runs on a Pi. However, what if you put it behind a wall? In another room? Your closet? You could mount some roof speakers to your roof. Imagine using that. You could play music until you fall asleep, and then it could wake you up in the morning. You could get it to tell you the news. If Google adds calling to the SDK, you could talk to someone from your bed *without* a phone. Add Philips Hue lights, and you could have the coolest room around. * Make a smart mirror - Imagine having a bathroom mirror that could show you the time or show you the weather. You could make it scroll through Reddit for you. They've been a few people that have done this. All you have to do is mount a screen behind a mirror, and you're good to go. You could completely program a Python program that would do any of those things for you. If you aren't concerned about privacy, you could mount *cameras* in your bathroom and look at the back of your hair while you comb it. * Make a grammar checker for school - I'm thinking of making this myself. Imagine having a program that could point out to you how many words are in an essay, your most common words, your most common phrases, etc. You could get it to point out having the same words and phrases in different sentences. I think it could cut down on editing time a ton. In reality, the world is your oyster. You can hack pretty much anything and make it do something cool with Python. My advice would be to think of something that you want to do faster or better. Once you've got an idea, make it happen. It's a pretty common misconception that it's hard to get things to work together. It's not. If you want to do something, it will happen. And, undoubtedly, along the way, you'll learn something new as well.
If you have any interest in front end languages, try elm. Good intro to functional programming as well.
Smalltalk Learning to be a disciplined and consistent OO programmer in Smalltalk has made me a better Python developer
Haskell. I loved Python because of the conciseness and productivity and elegance. Haskell just turns that to 11 and also gives you great performance and catches most of your errors at compile time.

Could you give me some use cases? I'm fascinated by it but never see a need in my work. I always end up thinking scala would be a better investment. 
The English language. Most of my Python books were written in this language. I’m pretty sure most of Python was also written in this language. Its almost like *pseudocode*, if you will. 
You might want to look at Cython. It links Python to C, allowing you to use very efficient C libraries. 
I would look into it, but I've heard exception handling is *atrocious*. I might choose Deutsche, it's a more rustic paradigm. 
I mean it's a general purpose language, so anything you can do in Scala / Python. I'm currently using it for back-end, front-end and compiler development. At this point any project I would have done in Python I instead do in Haskell.
I've been really wanting to try Elm, but the syntax looks so alien to me. I've been reading so many good things though that I really need to sit down hard and push through with it. Any good sites out tutorials you would recommend?
&gt; Does it make more sense to load requests (even in coroutine form) in a queue and empty it at a sustained pace? it's probably a good idea to have both a rate limit and a limit to how many simultaneous requests you have to most services, which your queue idea doesn't trivially cover.
Look at variable scope here. 
True, but neither does the rate limiter in the post, at least from my understanding of it. Conceivably, it would allow an infinite number of concurrent requests just only adding 10 at a time (or whatever the maximum tokens are set to). You still need a semaphore to limit concurrent requests (or event or condition). 
What exchange are you talking to? Having trouble finding an API
If not, Español is pretty alright
I was only vaguely aware of Arrow when I toyed around with Apache Drill last year. I had no idea its potential was this far reaching. Seems like my job is only going to get more amazing as time progresses.
Thanks or the Selenide information. I have been using selenium and sikuli together. Going to give it a try.
It does basic the same stuff as python, though, just slightly better at some things and slightly worse at others. It's not a good compliment.
Making a game in pygame to suprise my girlfriend for our anniversary. Kindof on the same note, if anyone knows any good pygame examples on github?
Web frontend - javascript/HTML/CSS. Python sucks at GUIs, but is pretty good for making web backends, so web technologies bridge that gap. Python sucks at packaging and distribution, so running it on a server and letting clients fetch from that can be a bridge there. Pure python jobs exist, but full-stack web development is a lot more common.
Definitely agree! Personally, I learned web dev before python so I'm set there. I could never be a designer or full stack developer, though, so I'm looking to build out my back end skill set. 
An rsync management tool. Sits as a daemon on multiple servers which send out rsync stats, jobs and connection details through a REST interface using JSONAPI. Uses Vue.js to connect to each one and provide a single web interface for lots of servers. It has its own scheduler, and can pause/resume rsync tasks. Edit: It uses Tornado, but I might change it...
I usually use English.

Think about how much better the documentation would be if all of the people who spent their time complaining about others hard work put that same level of effort into submitting PR’s to fix whatever they felt was worth bitching about in the first place. 
It sounds like you'd be interested in https://home-assistant.io/ - it's an open source and fully local smart home system, with support for literally hundreds of components (ie hardware, APIs, automation, etc). *However*, a quick search doesn't show any use of the Google Assistant SDK - if you add that to HA you can take advantage of the architecture and all the other plugins, and it'll be useful to thousands of people :)
You're right. As mentioned in the post, another mechanism is needed to [limit the number of actually concurrent requests](https://quentin.pradet.me/blog/how-do-you-limit-memory-usage-with-asyncio.html). Even with this, it's still possible to get an early request that never runs. It would be interesting to see how we can modify the rate limiter do model this better, possibly with a queue, yes. I actually run this code in production but never needed to really think about this because for my use case I send many requests, then stop, then send many requests, etc. So I never had an issue with an early request that never got a chance to run. Thank you for the interesting question!

The "killer app" for getting turned onto Haskell's capabilities is writing a parser for some arcane filetype using parser combinators. It's amazing.
Your data should be declared outside the loop, and then when you are inside of a loop,fuction,or while statement depending on interaction or manipulation. I'm not too sure what you are trying to accomplish but if you are checking for unique values you would just declare your list e.g. pos_ints = [] while True: guess = input() if int(guess) not in pos_ints: pos_ints.append(guess).... and so on

Great idea mate
As a text editor? As a Python editor fine, but not text.
I use WingIDE for my python code editor and TextPad for my text editor. Textpad is nice because it supports syntax highlighting for custom file formats.
Learning python on code academy... After that I don't really know.. Might work on building a physical robot. IDK too much about programming it but dammit I can build a frame though 
Whenever I have performance problems that get too hairy to be solved with numba or numpy, I turn to C. In all honesty however, I often have to turn to Matlab. Not because it is better in any way, but because I am a scientist, and I have to run other scientists code, which is often written in Matlab. The other language I use regularly is elisp, for playing with my text editor. It can be a fun distraction to puzzle through some Lisp when I'm stuck im my scientific endeavors. 
I would absolutely recommend the book, started it right after I took a course about Python Fundamentals, and I'm in Chapter 12 and really enjoy it. The book goes through the fundamentals in the first 6 chapters and then touches all the interesting things about automating boring things. I had zero CS knowledge, and this book helped me big time. All sorts of projects, all scales of difficulty and good references if you find a subject you want to check more in the future. 
I would say this is cool, but... Buzzfeed.
Many of these complaints could be given about Excel. However, as a user, I don't care so long as the tool solves my problem and is fast enough. And Pandas is awesome for small data!; we shouldn't lose sight of that. Indeed, "small data" is a relative term and as computers become more capable so too will Pandas. But Pandas doesn't need to do everything. Different problems and resources call for different tools like Arrow, Spark, and Dask which shouldn't detract from Pandas.
There's a Python port if you're interested - Selene. But it's not 100% done. 
I use Visual Studio Code. Fast, small, lost of plugins, monthly updates, can run python in the editor itself (or any other terminal controlled app.), and it is a general use editor as well.

I found Go to be compliant with the "zen of python"
Been mentioned once already, but I'm going to say Go. Seems a lot of places use it as a language alongside Python, and often appeals to people who like writing Python. At my work we use a Python/Go stack. 
To complement Python as my personal choices Understand, if you really must :) Frontend: Typescript .NET: F# Android: Kotlin Performance: C/Cython/Rust/Numba
Have a look popular image sets handle this, you will generally see for each image a text file of some description with annoatations. Granted you can easily convert between annotation styles, depending on what framework you use want to use you might put it directly in a native format. In my object detection case tensorflow liked xmls, cntk wanted tsv. My annotation framework I developed stores everything in a SQLite DB from which I can easily convert.
You can rename each file to its md5 hash if you want a good distribution when using this scheme.
This week, I have been trying to make an app for android, written in Python. I don't have an idea for an app yet but I still want to try doing this for a bit of fun. If you have any suggestions please let me know!
 number of characters (3 million files * 128 characters for metadata) = 384,000,000 characters (384 million) 384e6 * 2 bytes per character / 1024 (bytes/KB) / 1024 (KB/MB) / 1024 (MB/GB) = 0.7 GB At 0.7 GB for a file with a saneish amount of metadata (128 characters of half-width unicode), I'd just use a dictionary and put it all in memory. In regards to h5py, I wouldn't use it. h5py doesn't support unicode, though I think pytables does. h5py's goal is to make it simple to access numpy arrays.
Python started in 1991, so no it was not even close to as popular. The ecosystem wasn't close to nearly as evolved as it is now.
How complex is it? It sounds pretty simple. 
Pascal is a very good non-OOP teaching language. You can transfer almost everything you learn to C (which is still one of the core industry standars) but at the same time it doesn't allows as much non human readable stuff as C.
How likely is it to have a hash collision in this case?
Thanks, I have missed that. Autocorrect got me again.
Sorry; RNNs are not that great at conveying complex messages. Figured it would be a good fit.
Pascal had a lot of early support inside the MACOS so it used to be more relevant. Back then C wasn't nearly as dominant and it could have gone either way. Add to that how colleges that are quick to adapt are still 2-4 years behind the industry curve and you were probably working off of a legacy curriculum that was set up at least 15 years before you got there. 
I just tried, and I had no problems storing unicode neither as data or as a dataset/group key using h5py. This was with h5py 2.7.0 on Python 3.5.
Pascal was the Python of its day; Pascal was a popular teaching language since the 80s and curricula change slowly. The other thing that folks don't realize now is that there was no Internet as you know it today. You would learn about new languages by reading articles, talking to people at conferences and buying books at a bookstore. Trying out a new language meant driving your car to the local software store, browsing the shelves and looking at box covers, then plunking down hard earned cash at the register. A few university weirdos were sharing stuff over the "Internet" or on bulletin boards, but that was definitely not mainstream.
For me its C++ since that is the language that most libraries I need (which already doesn't use Python or have bindings) use.
This is de-clickbaiting their clickbait, therefore it's good

Using this weird python API trick…
I think this kind of overloading is just a basic feature that all languages have, they only differ in the mechanisms used to change the meaning of words. For example, in Russian, a language that is in many ways quite different from English, you have these verbs formed from a common verb *ставить* (to put/place) with different prefixes (similarly to phrasal verbs in English): *подставить* - to put under/near, to substitute, to betray *поставить* - to place, to supply *приставить* - to put against *проставить* - to fill in *оставить* - to leave *обставить* - to surround, to furnish, to defeat *отставить* - to put aside, to dismiss *выставить* - to put forward, to exhibit, to take out *вставить* - to insert *заставить* - to force *наставить* - to edify *расставить* - to arrange, to move apart 
If you are not interested in the language I would recommend you go with something like Orange or Weka or better yet learn R and use Rstudio.

I've been trying to do that for a while now but the problem is that each type of image has a different html tag and it makes the script way to complicated if I were to so that.

It's like what Buzzfeed editors do, but backwards!
After seeing this bot in action, I'm convinced the writers at buzzfeed are given a working title by their higher ups, and write an article based on the title they are given 
What started as a twitter disagreement carries over into this civil discussion of software testing. Brian and Paul discuss testing practices such as the testing pyramid, TDD, unit testing, system testing, and balancing test effort. * the Testing Pyramid * the Testing Column * TDD * unit testing * balancing unit with system tests, functional tests * API testing * subcutaneous testing * customer facing tests

Well if you create a soup object with the HTML you've supplied in the pastebin then `findAll()` returns 1 element. Where did that HTML come from? Is it from the contents of `driver.page_source`? If not, the first step would be to write the contents of `driver.page_source` to a file and inspect it.
You've inspired me. F**k clickbait!
Haha good point. I guess I worded that wrong 
Learning to write software in an IDE would be counterproductive. IDEs are designed to make the development process easier for experienced developers, and assume a certain level of proficiency with the language and it's ecosystem. For the experienced developer this is fine, because if the IDE gets it wrong, the developer knows how to correct it. The inexperienced developer will fall into the trap of assuming that the IDE is right, and will spend more time learning about the IDE itself than learning the language and basic programming strategies. They're huge, complex, and highly specialized. You don't need that when you're learning to program.
Cool project though
Glad you like it. /r/savedyouaclick has a pretty similar concept if you're not subscribed to that sub already 
Thanks
If you're dealing with discrete amounts - e.g. money, distance, etc - use `decimal.Decimal`. If you're not, use float. If you want to have an example why, say you have three US dimes and use floats to represent them: `pocket = [.1, .1, .1]` Does `sum(pocket) == .3`? It looks like it should, but it doesn't. You'll end up with something like `.300000000004` On a small scale like this, you're likely to just round it off without a thought but you'll eventually get inconsistencies between what you expect and what the computer tells you. With `decimal.Decimal`, you get actual decimal math rather than float approximations. As an aside, currency is the type of money you're dealing with: USD, Yen, Euros, etc. A monetary amount is a currency and a decimal.

I probably misinterpretted the driver.page_source command. I was under the impression that told soup to look at the page source of what selenium was looking at. I guess I could just save the html file and get all the data I want that way. But I think I am on to something now, I got the list to populate with the HTML code, however its the wrong code. I know it is at least pulling from the site my chromedriver is looking at. I think I am just fundamentally doing something wrong with soup
I don't think that's the best solution. It would clutter the entire text post and kind of take away from the point of the sub.

I'm looking into Common Lisp to bypass python's limitations: - faster (it compiles to bytecode) (see how [pgloader](http://tapoueh.org/blog/2014/05/14-pgloader-got-faster.html) was rewritten from Python to CL for a 30x speed gain) - easier to ship and deploy (we can build self-contained executables, even for web apps, allowing for an Electron app or hot deployment) (for example [pgcharts](https://github.com/dimitri/pgcharts)) - building a C executable (ECL implementation), for the JVM, for Android,… - connecting to a remote instance - more types (CL does more type checking and we can optimize and declare types in precise places, up to inspecting the produced assembly) - more flexible language, more language paradigms - refactoring everything the way I want with macros - development is more interactive (interactive debugger, I can run the test I'm in,…) It's ok for web back end (exples: [turtl](https://github.com/turtl/api), [potato (slack-like)](https://github.com/cicakhq/potato),…) Also [Nim](https://nim-lang.org/) could be a solution in most topics (except interactive development at least) but it is much younger and lacks libs.

Dictionaries are unordered. Either the book is wrong or you are misinterpreting it. 
I added the text from the book to the post a moment ago. Is there an easy way, like function or something, to sort by key?
Thanks for the review, I might check it out!
This isn't true at all. Using pycharm incentivizes good technique as you type by alerting you to non pep8 code and advising you of alternative condtructs, allows Auto completion to ease memory strain and syntax and scope checking are undoubtedly useful for beginners as well.
Your book is definitely misleading. Dictionaries use a hash table to store keys. Technically it's sorted, but not alphabetically or numerically or any other way you could see just by looking at the keys. `sorted(Colors.keys())` will give you the sorted keys of your dict.
In 3.6, kwargs and dictionary keys are remembered in order of insertion, so if you say `i for i in Colors.keys()`, you'll get them in order. Also Colors should be lower-case.
I would recommend the above link. Also worth a look is this article on medium. This hitchhikers guide listed on there will give you lots of direction for anything you can think of. “Python Top 10 Articles for the Past Year (v.2017)” @Mybridge https://medium.mybridge.co/python-top-10-articles-for-the-past-year-v-2017-6033ae8c65c9 Also, avoid code academy just now. It's old python and it's best to work at version 3. 
&gt; I added the text from the book to the post a moment ago. It's just wrong. I would not recommend using this book any further. &gt; Is there an easy way, like function or something, to sort by key? Again, a dictionary is unordered. If you want something that has order, you have to use a different data structure. For example you could use a list of key/value tuples, because lists are ordered, but then you'd be unable to access items by key. You could also use `collections.OrderedDict`, which is a dict subtype that is ordered. 
You’re testing for 2^n. 
Thanks for the info. This is what my book shows as a demo of automatic dictionary sorting, but I see that's definitely not the reality. https://i.imgur.com/dqbjI5u.png

Is lowercase the standard in the Python community? I've always used lowercase and underscores for my variables when scripting, but both this book and my teacher insist on using capitalized variables.
The twitter and facebook posts are a little difficult (but not impossible). I only looked at one buzzfeed post, but the ones that are just images, this (somewhat naive regex) would work: &lt;img\s+class="[^"]*subbuzz__media-image[^"]*"[^&gt;]+data-src="([^"]+)"[^&gt;]*&gt; With `match.group(1)` giving you the url to the image. Of course, it's wrong to parse HTML with regular expressions. But I'm guessing you're already doing that. Let me know if you want some more in-depth help with it.
how detailed is your weather data?
It also overloads new programmers with information that's not really relevant to *learning how to program*. Look, if they've been using python for a little while, ticked a few boxes on some projects. Felt comfortable with the language but overwhelmed with larger projects, I'd totally recommend PyCharm. But for learning how to program? Who gives a damn about PEP-8 when you're still trying to figure out when to apply for loops? Beginners need to make syntax errors. They need to fight with indentation issues. They need to have these problems, otherwise they never develop the mental tools necessary to solve more complex problems later.
Capitalized names like your example are used for class names. Instance variables should be "snake case", which means lower case and underscores. There's an official style guide for Python called PEP8 at https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/. Regardless of what your teacher makes you do for this class, you should follow PEP8 outside of class.
I'll take a look at that. I'm planning on doing some projects after this class. Thanks
This really takes everything full circle, doesn't it? /r/AskReddit -&gt; Buzzfeed Article -&gt; /r/buzzfeedbot
Basically 
Yeah that is how it all started out. This was really before smartphones took off. I actually liked it better with SMS.
When you build from source and install a dependency you have to rebuild your python interpreter.
Yes, I am. I missed some of the dependencies I think some of the later replies cover that I think. 
Thanks really helpful. :+1:
I don't know if it's changed but last time I went around updating stuff, 3.6 installed from apt-get installed as python3.6 which is fine but it does make some venv stuff messy/confusing to deal with. From source installs/ed it as python3. I have grown wary of apt lately. easier to get up to date software from source, aside from the minor problem in my OP (which is only a little annoying).
I use Notepad++!
Styling is [pretty much completely codefied](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).
Why would someone torture a bot to post buzzfeed shit. Robots have rights to.
&gt; i seen a few ways on github but they are all out of date Why are they 'out of date'? What features are they missing that you need?
Yeah that's definitely wrong. Not only does that not happen, it absolutely shouldn't happen either. Edit: that's not alphabetical anyway. Sarah should go after Sam. Idk what screwed up when that screenshot was taken, but something did. 
I want to go sorta the *opposite* way and feed a Twitter feed with Reddit posts... But I'm lazy.
there wasn't much on it tho
Gotcha, thanks! I've been digging through the lab data, chart events data etc looking for something a little more granular but on this iteration and am including ICD10 diagnoses data so wish me luck! 
get a better book. the text you quoted is outright wrong. a Python dictionary is an unordered data structure and the keys aren't "sorted to make access faster". It's a hash table. It has constant lookup times because of the way hash maps work, not because it keeps the keys sorted.
