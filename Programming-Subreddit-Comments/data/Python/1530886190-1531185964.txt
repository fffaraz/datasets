Question 8 in exam 3 seems to be wrong 
Why would getting an MBA change how you learn python? Are you asking what might be the best use cases for python for someone with an MBA? That depends on what you want to do. 
Yeah, you said you have written the python code to control the generator. Now you just need to build a simple UI in your GUI framework of choice and plug your functions to your buttons/input boxes/whatever you need. pm me if you get stuck ;)
I don't have a ton of experience with chatbots yet, but I recommend starting with [python-aiml](https://pypi.org/project/python-aiml/). You should be able to find some good AIML [starting scripts](https://github.com/drwallace/aiml-en-us-foundation-alice) to start off and get the chat experience going, and can build up from there.
Are those parentheses required?
Great catch - I'll fix it to a less-than sign :) Thanks! 
Wow thanks man man 👍🏼👍🏼
I thought I was going insane for a second. Thanks for responding so quickly. 
As you noted, Geodetic doesn't play nice with Euclidean space. So converting Geodetic (WGS84) to ECEF put it in Cartesian space. You can then use spatial indexing with a Kd-Tree or a R*-Tree and performing range searching. If you don't convert to ECEF, you can use a Ball Tree and keep the coordinates in Geodetic, but now you are working with circles vs squares/rectangles. Personally I like the Kd-Tree as build time is `O(nlogn)` and I've optimized my searches to complete in `O(sqrt(n) + m)` time where `m` is the number of points returned by the search. A few good links for Kd-Tree: [one](http://www.cs.utah.edu/~lifeifei/cs6931/kdtree.pdf), [two](https://www.cse.wustl.edu/~taoju/cse546/lectures/Lecture21_rangequery_2d.pdf), [three](https://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~suri/cs235/RangeSearching.pdf), [four](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse373/02au/lectures/lecture22l.pdf). 
You can use pdfcrack (open sourcr C program) to crack the password and pikepdf to do the decrypt merge. Pdfrw and PyPDF2 don't support all flavors of PDF encryption. Pikepdf does.
Don't worry you weren't the only one. I was typing out a response to why I believed the question was correct and then it hit me. Let me know if you catch any other errors - I'll fix them asap. 
/r/learnpython is your best bet if you're missing fundamentals like this, but really imagine your code is something like sp = open_serial_port() # not a real function sp.send('SET FREQ 720Hz') sp.send('SET PWM 50%') sp.send('SET WAVEFORM SQUARE') you could put that into a function you can call in a file called `wavegen.py` def configure_wavegen(freq, pwm, waveform): sp = open_serial_port() # not a real function sp.send(f'SET FREQ {freq}Hz') sp.send(f'SET PWM {pwm}%') sp.send(f'SET WAVEFORM {waveform}') configure_wavegen(720, 50, 'SQUARE') then in the UI framework you choose you could just call that function whenever a control updates. from wavegen import configure_wavegen # imagine a UI framework of some sort that stores all the controls, and all the controls store their value def on_freq_slider_update(ui, slider): configure_wavegen(ui.freq.value, ui.pwm.value, ui.waveform.value) def on_freq_slider_update(ui, slider): configure_wavegen(ui.freq.value, ui.pwm.value, ui.waveform.value) def on_freq_slider_update(ui, slider): configure_wavegen(ui.freq.value, ui.pwm.value, ui.waveform.value) Note that all the above code is absolutely grotty and horrible but about what I've seen from electrical engineers. You need to start somewhere, and horrible, rough and ready code that works is a great place to start so you can learn how to make things better over time. Ask over in /r/learnpython for much much better advice than this.
When studying computer science you need to show that you can think abstractly. In the "real world" you always have a compiler to check if something is whatever, but copying consumes time, and you're faster if you think yourself. But in here the first question is really bad. Humans are bad at counting, and how easy is it to overlook a colon. Or maybe worse: count it as two dots.
I appreciate what you did here. But you should consider [not using Udemy](https://youtu.be/X7jf70dNrUo).
Hi! I'm new to programming overlall and I just started Python workshop at my college. Watched your first video and just wanted to ask you several questions: What do you think about Jupyter Notebook? Can I work in Jupyter while watching your course, or do you recommend to use PyCharm? P.S. Quality of your video is really good, hope I will learn something useful :)
What's the supposed benefit of this PEP? Is it supposed to produce a performance benefit? Personally, I find the syntax convoluted. It makes code less readable, and I'm likely to avoid using it if accepted.
I think tkinter is a good choice for this project. The code you have already written may only need just a few more lines to do what you want. If you post the code you have so far, we can probably fill in the missing puzzle pieces for you. Congrats on getting 90% of the way to the solution already on your own. These are the kind of questions I like.
Very meta
I think this is a great point. I started teaching on Udemy when I was 14 when I launched my first Python course. Since then I've garnered over 175,000+ students and have made a decent impact with my courses. I completely agree with some of the things said in the video but it's really hard to leave Udemy when most of my user base and revenue is coming through their platform. I personally enjoy how easy it is to upload content and create courses. However, I'm definitely looking into my own LMS and hosting my own content such that users never have to go to Udemy to enroll in the near future - thanks for the comment!
Here's [Raymond Hettinger's opinion of PEP-572](https://twitter.com/raymondh/status/1014220010825252864) &gt; It's a mixed bag. Some of the examples in the PEP look nice. Others are cryptic or a little bizarre. &gt; For some people, assignment expressions reduce their cognitive load and match the way they think. For others, the opposite is true. I definitely fall in the camp of those who view this as *cryptic* or *bizarre*. I think `:=` doesn't make sense to *Python* engineers as much as it does to engineers familiar with this construct in other languages. Personally, I think it takes a huge toll on Python's beauty and readability and doesn't provide much in the way of benefits to justify that toll.
That's awesome - You're going to love Python. Yes, you can totally use the Jupyter Notebook as your editor throughout this course. Everything should work just fine. I hope you enjoy the course as well! 
Hey Avi! I think I remember your other Python courses on Udemy; they were really amazing! I'm definitely going to be enrolling in this. Thank you.
Yes they are, iirc the assignment has the lowest operator priority so in order to have it run and assign the value instead of the result of the expression you need the parentheses.
Thanks so much dude! A different course!
Some people to avoid writing more (essentially one line) would do a = func() if func() else whatever To these people, this pep will give better performance. To the rest of us, sane people, I don’t think so. There is also the argument that: b=func() a=b if b else something Pollutes namespace but: a=func() a=a if a else None Also works. I suppose the idea is to use them at ifs but as you said, makes the syntax convoluted.
Will we have access to this content in the future if we enroll now, or will we be charged or blocked off once the trial period is over?
It's a discount coupon code at 100% meaning you get access to the course permanently just like you'd purchase it on Udemy yourself. You just have 1 week period to get it for free using the coupon code.
Ty so much for the course!! really nice content you got there. 
Made a script that requires a song name as arguement. It then searches youtube for that song, downloads the song in mp3 format and adds song metadata from itunes. [Github link](https://github.com/deepjyoti30/ytmdl) 
There's two significant differences: * pendulum's parser is more robust/predictable * pendulum's DateTime is derived from the standard library's DateTime, so you can use pendulum DateTimes directly in place of normal DateTime objects in most cases I have used both and I just prefer Pendulum.
I browsed the content of the course, it's so professional. thanks man
Also see question 3 of the first quiz.
This feels too much like it's going down the road of optimizing for LOS and typing speed, rather than readability and clarity. Yes it's obnoxious when you do this: if (expr): do_thing() and later realize you need the value of `expr` and have to change it to this: e = (expr) if e: do_thing(e) and that pattern is kind of obnoxious in examples like the one linked, but IMO it doesn't rise to the level of actually needing to be solved at the cost of new syntax. Honestly, it seems like we've created this machine whose output is "changes to python", and supply of those might be outpacing demand. 
:D Your gonna have to be more specific. A common thing that python is used for is web scraping. There are good cheap courses on Udemy. 
That's true, but awesome-python is a *huge* list and isn't so easy to consume in one go. Also, unfortunately, there is a lot of cruft in there because I don't think packages are removed very often.
Depends on the tasks you're running. I'd prefer gevent if the tasks are mostly I/O bound (e.g. web scraping) and prefork for anything else.
Kivy seems promising. I'll work on that this weekend and let you know my progress on Monday.
Will do but I can only upload it on Monday bc the code is at the lab. Everyone is busy enjoying the football game so they closed early
haha yeah man, not very well rounded on this side of development! I’ll have a look on Udemy though! :)
Can you please explain me what you mean by "generate the command"? The command for generating the signal? I'm sorry I'm just so confused
Pandas can read Excel files directly
I just try to begin the course and the cost is 11.99€ why?
I'll ask there as well. Thanks for the suggestion
Thanks a lot, looking forward to it!
This seems pretty great after a first look. I'll definitely give it a try. Thanks!

Right but what I mean is who in the world *would* like such sn absorption. No wonder requests isn't in there. Or whatever else.
That may not give you the exact location of the executable but it should get you close in your search. It will get you to the location where anaconda is installed which should contain the executable somewhere, so you may have to dig just a touch more.
thanks. hopes this helps me out, i've been struggling to learn for awhile
Fantastic. Thanks so much for this.
Fixed - Thanks! 
As an interviewer and hiring manager I only look at the school portion of a resume to see if they are a USC masters grad/candidate. If so I don't interview them. Some of the best engineers I've worked with did not have a CS degree. As long as you know your stuff and can prove it in an interview you'll be fine. 
I don't know. Probably anyone having experience can give suggest me. 
apiresponse['objects'][0]['id'] Objects is list, so you need to iterate over them or get by index
Say you have a GPIB function that you send (I have no idea, it's been too long since I looked at GPIB or HPIB) that you're passing over USB to the generator. I thought these were the commands you have implemented already in Python. FUNC,SIN,1V,60Hz Your GUI might have widgets for function, amplitude, and frequency. Each one of those might have a variable bound to them to store the data. Or you could get the values using a get() method on the widget. Regardless, you would get each of the values associated with the widget. function = &lt;your function listbox for your functions&gt;.get() amp = float(&lt;your text field for amplitude&gt;.get(0)) freq = float(&lt;your text field for frequency&gt;.get(0)) Now that you have your data, you can build the command to send such as cmd=f'FUNC,{function },{amp },{freq}' Then send cmd (which is a string) to the device. 
What’s wrong with USC? 
This is the exact course for me - all the topics are the current gaps in my knowledge. Thanks so much! Super excited to get going
Thanks 
Their CS Masters program is very poor. It's a funnel for many India Tech students who are not qualified for jobs use to basically buy their credentials and try to get into the workforce here in LA. I've experienced this many times in interviews when these Masters grads couldn't get a basic for loop example to run. They didn't understand basic concepts so I've back balled them. Everyone I've worked with her past 6 years has echod my feelings on the subject, all having had bad experiences.

1. Selenium is great for testing Web interfaces 2. vscode would be enough for learning, pycharm is great for big projects 4. Recommend you to complete "Dive into Python" course http://www.diveintopython.net/ "Fluent Python" is great (advanced level) 
I love Udemy because it’s a cheap way to get some decent material. Udemy needs to do better though based on Sentex’s critiques.
I love you both

I started CS studies 2 years ago, but didn't really learn much so far. I spent my free time mainly learning languages and coding, but don't have much experience yet. I recently started working and I'm learning everything from scratch - I personally thought I'm under qualified, but I got hired anyway. Use courses to learn, not to get a certificate - it only shows you attended to something, not that you know and understand it. Code, solve problems, upload them to repository (Github, Bitbucket, Gitlab...). Add it to CV. Take one you are most proud of and state it - they don't have time to check all little scripts. I think the most important tip is to apply to jobs you are under qualified to do. You can't lose anything by doing that. If you get accepted - well, you got what you came for. If you get rejected - you learn more about how such interviews look like and what you still need to learn. Don't be afraid to ask what you should work on - my technical interviewer said what was good, what was missing and what I should learn to have an easier start at this job and, honestly, I feel like it made me more likely to be accepted, by the way that he answered my question. 
okay thank you
Check if the course you want to buy on Udemy isn't available somewhere else - many are just copies of free courses from YouTube etc. 
I might add to /u/artem_v_vasilyev's concise answer that the apiresponse\['objects'\] is a list of dictionaries. Grabbing the first with apiresponse\['objects'\]\[0\] will allow you to enter the list and apiresponse\['objects'\]\[0\]\['id'\] is going to return the desired response for your example.
Just my two cents here, I work for a small company so whenever we need programmers typically the job gets handed over to me, I really dont look too closely at the schooling section, what I normally ask for is a sample of their code in whichever language they choose, I care more about what they can do rather than where or what they went to school for
Bad bot 
Woosh, I see so many badly named variable: it reminds me my algorithms courses at the university ._.
SPAM POST WITH UDEMY BOTS.
I think that the problems /u/sentdex brought up are very important, but I'd much rather see people like /u/TheCurryMan_ (and other content creators) pressuring Udemy to do something about it rather than just not using the platform.

&gt; replaced an entire department of people with one VBS script Can you please link?
Are the bots written in Python?
The ones in the standard library. I'll leave you to find them as any decent search engine will point you in the right direction.
Don't bother, many answers there are poor or downright wrong, and the idiots who put them there don't like being corrected.
What this is looking for is a file to use to execute code. Most files are just text files, some fancier than others, that need to be read with certain rules. The interpreter is a file that has defined those rules and will attempt to read the text file. Therefore, you are probably looking for the location of your interpreter which will be located in the installation location. Find where Conda was installed, for me this could be done by opening the explorer, navigating to c:\\users\\libfreejaeg\\Anaconda3\\scripts\\ and look for conda.exe
Thank you! Will do this next :)
Trying to create a program that will close out other programs at a set schedule or under a timer. Ex. 9 p.m Skyrim will close on it's own. Feel free to guide me or shout a name of a module that would help me out, at least I'll get closer to finishing the project instead of starting a new one and forgetting about it.

I'd rather they did both. I think it's unfair to expect them to support, patronize, and help benefit a company they fundamentally don't agree with.
Hey Avi, I saw this 10 hour python video on YouTube sometime last year by you. Quite helpful. Haven't been able to work much on Python since, but surely looking around for opportunities. Good luck man!

Don't you want to change scope though? I have to admit, i prefer the dictionnary solution. It makes the statement look like a real case (like erlang, prolog, etc). I stumbled upon your post because I am coming back to Python after a year in Erlang. I really prefer Python (the two languages are not really comparable anyway) but I am missing pattern matching and atoms. I guess i should switch to OCaml. How do you get a job then...
Someone had illegally downloaded my previous Python course and uploaded it to YouTube making ad revenue off of it. By the time I discovered it, the video had already amassed 600,000+ views. I'm just glad I found it. Thanks though!
Clutch man! I just bought the HeadFirst Python book. This will be a great additional resource.
Hello ! I am also quite a newbie (2 months of python behind me), but i found a lot of ressources online. If you are totally new in the game, reading A bythe of Python by Swaroop CH could be a good start. His explanations are really easy to understand. You just need a text editor and a terminal at first. It will help you doing a lot of mistakes. 🤗 I spent hours to debug stupid errors and it taught me a lot. After several weeks of practice like that, I downloaded Sublime Text. Now I use PyCharm, which is wonderful for big projects, but it makes life too simple. Old tools are good to learn python logic, structure, philosophy, even a piece of paper. :) Good luck, Python is great ! 
Awesome thanks so much 
Thanks a lot man :)
Thank you so much! Starting today!
By all means abstract away the differences in the driver interfaces. That's totally a worthwhile abstraction, but it need not be anything more than a thin wrapper that provides connect and execute methods (maybe a couple more, but you get the point). I would be wary about using an ORM for just that, given that it's not really hard to write DB agnostic SQL queries. My main concern still is really with the hiding of the queries. If you don't know what the query being run and something goes wrong, be it functionally wrong or just poor performance, it's a barrier to diagnosing database issues. To give my concern context, my scope is enterprise, where once a databases choice has been made, changing it is pretty hard anyway for non-technical reasons. And in that scope having few moving parts and having the query visible to aid problem diagnosis is a huge positive. I understand that what OP has written is not enterprise software, and that it may very well be reasonable for the user to select their own database to back it. Although an ORM can provide that in a convenient manner, I still feel the transparency outweighs the convenience. But that's just my two cents. There have been big discussions around the internet on whether to use an ORM or not, so I don't think we'll get to the bottom of it here :)
Free is always good. Will check it out, thanks man.
You should watch sentdexs video on UDEMY. Stay away you all.
How could you possibly know that? 
Very cool of you
It is absolutely feasable to program something like that in Python. But if you are a beginner, you should focus on something way way way simpler. 
What you are looking for conceptually is machine learning/ai where you feed in a large set of existing questions and their answers in, and train a model that maps the relationships between them. Then you put in a new question and use the model to predict what the answer is given what it's seen before. Python has libraries to facilitate this kind of thing https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2016/06/27/my-top-9-favorite-python-deep-learning-libraries/. However, in my opinion this is not a project for a beginner programmer. 
The most important thing to consider is size. Obviously, if you have big data sets put them where they fit. Another important thing to consider is read and write speed when talking about SSD vs HDD. SSD will be faster for both, though less of a difference on writing. Something to also note is there is a physical arm that is moving on the HDD, and it can only do writing or reading, and may have to reset when switching between the two. The anaconda interpreter will be used each time you try to execute some file, so it's probability of having a noticeable difference is highest (if there is a difference) in read speed (you wont be writing to the interpreter). Typically, there are two types of text files you might be working with; the files that are python files (think .py), where you write the code to be executed; and files that contain data (think .csv). Your call to your .py files should only be read once, and your data files should only be read once if you wrote good code. Depending on if you are writing new data to a file, you maybe opening and writing to a file many times. If this is the case you may want to write to the SSD to take advantage of the faster write speed. So to summarize, in certain circumstances it may be optimal to put anaconda on ssd, .py files on hdd, datasets on hhd, and write new files to ssd. Though most use cases the measurable difference will be negligible.
That's a nice and informative blog!
That may be true, but until then guidelines and rules of this subreddit change, that is where these questions oght to be posted.
I didn’t think it would be possible for me to make but it is a goal for the future and knowing it’s possible is great as it gives me things to chase and potential projects to create, probably years down the line. I was mainly interested in it actually being possible using python or if it needed a different language.
There should be quotes around Avi in Question 10 of the first quiz.
Well shit, sorry to hear that. Keep up the good work though.

Awesome job. I believe you have a mistake in question 10 [here](https://imgur.com/a/EoSGIq5).

Good catch - fixed!
Glad you liked it 😁
Alternatively to this specific example, a = func() or whatever
I find it off-putting he's using old formatting. Hope the course isn't Python2.
Although, many people seem to hate this change, I don't mind it any more than any of the other obscure syntactic sugar in Python. However, I would have preferred that the variable go out of scope automatically when the block ends.
Good bot.
There are places where it can make intention clearer. I guess they will be few and far between for god-level python coders. For people like me who are better at C than Python, there will be far too many places where I end up using C idioms, now that I can choose to have almost C-like side effects.
Thank you, just signed up to the course after I knock this CISSP out in September.
Hey clam_powder, If you're inclined, I do run a YouTube channel and have a playlist on precisely this topic. Namely, how to do various web scraping and automation with Python. Most of the videos are based on actual specific tasks you yourself may want to do and I think could serve as a nice springboard for your own purposes. I attempt to make my tutorials general enough to be applicable to projects that you may encounter yourself. Hope these are helpful, and please do let me know if you have questions or comments. Always trying to improve my content: [LucidProgramming Web Scraping and Automation Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5tcWHG-UPH1fnJw-BvBiiiPUPm1LUKsm)
SSH into a development server where you have more control? 
What have you tried so far? Have you got some code you can post?
This is well known in the python ecosystem. Stdlib is where modules go to die. simplejson maintain an external fork of the stdlib json package.
Is this for a home project or work, just curious? 
And that sucks Are there significant changes between the stdlib package?
For breaking down a URL, I'm a huge fan of John Kurkowski's package [https://github.com/john-kurkowski/tldextract](https://github.com/john-kurkowski/tldextract).
Don't know. Never used it.
This is awesome!
Or u can just download pro.version and find some 'license activate server' in web)
Skim the manuals and start a small project. It can take a while to start using the syntax correctly.
I have tested several, and the one I will recommend without hesitation is [`pprofile`](https://github.com/vpelletier/pprofile). It is really super-easy to use and provide line-by-line profiling for Python 3 out of the box.
good github portfoilo or a successful shipped app in appstore etc a lot of developers dont have a degree these days
Mainly, I've been helping my company migrate to Python 3. One of the important tasks is to create reactive analogs of many parts of a monolith, and refactoring it to use those instead of doing it itself. These past few days, I've been working with a few other teams to verify that the changes made haven't changed prod. I did the detailed verification in Python, but others used e.g. SQL queries. Later this week, I'm doing a crash course in NLP by helping my brother with his ML homework assignment. I've never done anything like that, so it should be fun.
Awesome, thank you!

I'm working on a new blog: https://www.python-celery.com Everything about Celery (it's been the story of my life for the past few years). Doing a "content sprint" this and next week. Is there anything Celery-related you are particularly interested in?

Thanks for sharing! I was familiar with Kd-trees, but I haven't seen them applied in this context. Is there a library that applies this method? I assume it can be faster than the convergence of Vincenty's formulae for large data sets
Awesome! Thank you :)

Others will point you at resources, I'll just try and offer some advice. I appreciate the desire to skip the early grind, but having watched a *lot* of very good, very experienced C++ guys do just that, I'd *strongly* advise against it. Skim, even skim quickly, but don't try to skip. The reason is a lot of these guys got very good very quickly at writing very bad Python... there's a lot of ideas that superficially *look* similar, but really aren't, from low level things like truth value testing and operator chaining to high level ideas about classes and how to achieve an elegant interface. Writing Python in the same manner you'd write C++ will more often than not result in an inelegant, often ugly, and rarely efficient (for Python) bit of code. That isn't to say your knowledge won't speed you along, I just wouldn't try to leap right over it. There's a lot of virtue in Python's "boring semantics" that's just different enough to be worth grasping on its own merits.
cprofilev
The scoping makes sense to me. It is the same as it would be in the desugared form.
It makes sense either way to me. It's like the variable was declared immediately before the block using it. It would have been nice if it went away though, like having an implicit del after the block.
No, most of them are not.
Actually all 3. Actually I'm working with Red Pitaya but I wanted to compare the signal characteristics of Red Pitaya and a proper signal generator. At work I'm using the Red Pitaya for developing an SDR implemented GPR
The first in-depth Python course I signed up for and went all the way through was on Udemy. As someone who uses Udemy still, a couple thoughts on that video: + The payment / pay out system is what it is. If you don't like it, don't use. The pricing structure they use is not uncommon from other media distribution sites, so I feel like that's a moot point. Don't like the distribution? Sure, I get it, but it's more or less in line with other royalty media sites. They're not being evil, it's just their business model, and other content creators have agreed it's a fair bargain. Keep in mind that the course instructors get access to student's email addresses (whether in plain text or via an in-house distribution system I do not know), so they can use that information they get from Udemy to cross promote their own courses in the future. + I do agree that they need to better audit their courses to make sure they are not pirated or stolen. That is definitely a reasonable request and I think his idea about having paid courses pay for the self-audit is a good idea. But I think it's a bit of a stretch to say "hey, don't use this at all". I understand he's been frustrated with it and that sucks, but it is still a valuable tool for many content creators and for many, many people.
Question 5 in the first test is wrong. 3/2 is 1 in python, but 3.0 / 2.0 is 1.5 I tested it in python 2.7.15 Code: num = 2 / 3 print num numb = 3.0 / 2.0 print numb 
That’s so cool! I’m only familiar with RTL-SDR dongles and non-GPR applications. Would you mind sharing (even if privately) where you work? 
It’s been far too long for me to find it back unfortunately. Basically he worked in a department that corrected errors with date formatting on spreadsheets. Apparently they would get hundreds of these sheets per day to look over. He wrote a script that would correct almost all of them automatically, and point out ones that it couldn’t for human review. With that script he was able to exhaust all the sheets that came in during a single day. Thus, replaced his department.
There are many libraries, but I prefer to write my own sometimes! I think `scipy` has one where you can use direct coordinates. And yes its extremely fast for large datasets.
Various little things like turning: while True: x = prepare() if not x: break complex_verbose_stuff(x) or: x = prepare() while x: complex_verbose_stuff(x) x = prepare() into: while x := prepare(): complex_verbose_stuff(x) I admit I've been missing this a few times. It's not about number of lines, but about removing artificial distracting complexity required by awkward workarounds for missing expressive language constructs.

Maybe, but then it's inconsistent with similar construct (for loop variable) which would breed a bit of cognitive dissonance. I still think the best example for assignment expressions is in the if clause of comprehensions. The non-sugar version is significantly longer
According to the title, this is homework so they should absolutely be able to use the python interpreter. I don't think this is a bad question per say; if you're counting by hand, you're definitely doing it wrong.

It depends on what you mean by "learn". There are libraries like others mentioned, but if you're just trying to store and retrieve 'facts' from memory, you could just write functions to interpret user input so that certain strings identify certain 'facts' (probably also string data) and return answers. That's pretty basic. 
Thanks dude.
Thank You, I'll give it a look later today!
I checked. There's already a bug report for it.

Wow I’m really impressed on several levels. Your responsiveness is great. But also how effective this has been to QA your product. Well done
&gt; on Udemy when I was 14 when I launched my first Python course. Since then I've garnered over 175,000+ students and have made a decent impact with my courses. I completely agree with some of the things said in the video but it's really hard to leave Udemy when most of my user base and revenue is coming through their platform. I personally enjoy how easy it is to upload content and create courses. However, I'm definitely looking into my own LMS and hosting my own content such that users never have to go to Udemy to enroll in the near future - thanks for the comment Yes I agree. It's cheap and has some amazing content but I feel like Udemy exploit their content creators. Good for consumers, not so much for the producers.
I have done this using Requests: import requests url = "http://example.com/upload.php" payload = {"name": "John", "lastname":"Smith"} files = {"image": open("theimagename.png", "rb")} with requests.post(url, data=payload, files=files) as response: print(response.status_code) print(response.text) It is super important that you examine the HTML of the form element so you will know the names of the variables to send.

Thanks! I've bought another Python course already but it can't hurt to have another!
I agree with your P.S. If they used an actual keyword like `as`, then I think the code would be a lot more readable and I'd have less of an issue with this PEP.
Wait - so does /r/python all of a sudden like Udemy again? 
Depends on too many specifics (i.e. where you are located, where the data is located, what kind of data it is, what the TOS are, how you are going to obtain it, how you are going to use it, etc. etc.). To get a concrete answer you will need to hire an attorney specializing in this field in YOUR jurisdiction. &gt; Can data that is in the public domain (Race has happened and results have been published) be copyrighted? Be careful. Just because something is published does not make it "public domain" Furthermore, in the United State (again, nobody knows where you are) facts are not copyrightable, but compilations of facts *can* be... again, it all depends on details. So for instance, you *can* copyright a map, even though the discrete information making up a map (i.e. the coordinates and names of streets) is individually purely factual. Yet you cannot copyright the contents of a simple phonebook (i.e. a collection of names and phone numbers), which again, are individually purely factual. (e.g. [Feist Publications, Inc., v. Rural Telephone Service Co.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feist_Publications,_Inc.,_v._Rural_Telephone_Service_Co.)) Again, it ALL depends on the exact details.
Nice. Thanks fam!

Great course! My wishes: 1. More coverage on OOP with practical usage examples with UML concepts and program design 2. More coverage on standard library especially the collections module 
It's important to keep in mind that almost certainly every language that you've ever heard of, including Python, is what is called a general-purpose, high-level programming language. What that means is that any program that you might be interested in writing, however complicated, is programmable in these languages. Now, there are certainly languages that are more suited to particular tasks, but suitability is a different question. To answer your specific question, of course Python can be used to write programs that "learn" - so could Java, C, C++, etc.
This is awesome! Thank you very much. I've embarked on a journey to know more about data science and hope to master python soon 
Imo, they should implement 337 and let us use our own context managers to handle something like this. https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0377/

Why'd you use BS4 for getting the words? That seems a bit heavy for something like this. If you're on a \*NIX system, you probably already have a dictionary file available locally to pull words from. Other than that, great job!
 from random import randint while input("Press Y to roll").upper == "Y": print(randint(1, 6))
That's just an if block but with extra steps. I'll admit to wanting this a few times but it's usually easier to work around than not. You can always implement it with ExitStack if you really need to. 
Right now, I chose to add both of the following to path, in addition to the Local equivalents: C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\Programs\Python\Python37\Scripts\ C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\Programs\Python\Python37\ That said, I have no idea why or what benefit that provides.
Can you give TLDR?

I have an idea for an app but no coding experience whatsoever. I would go out and learn the code, but my idea requires some extensive coding that would take me potentially years to master. I'm looking for someone who can help me write a scalable MVP (minimum viable product) with python so I can test the concept and in exchange, I would, of course, offer financial compensation. I don't have a lot of money so I can't afford freelance coders. Is anyone interested in working with me? 
Thank you for this sir, and I would like to say in advance sorry for downloading this. I'm not connected always in internet but I have my own laptop to study. 
I love PETL but haven’t used it for databases. 
To save
No. I suggest Arcade (https://arcade.acadamy) as a good starter enginer. After that you're talking "frameworks" (SDL2, Pyglet etc) or up to big engines like UNity, Godot in which case you won't be using Python. Go with Arcade to start off with. It's modern.
Please tell me this is sarcastic...
I'm going to be "that person" and say that *you really shouldn't use HTML+CSS for a native GUI*. Including an entire Chromium rendering engine adds quite a bit of bloat to your app. Based on your requirements, I'd say [Sciter](https://sciter.com) might be great. It's a GUI library that uses a subset, slightly modified version of HTML and CSS along with a JavaScript dialect (TIScript). There are [Python bindings available](https://github.com/sciter-sdk/pysciter). In addition to being far lighter, it's also incredibly flexible and easier to use than manually building a REST API. 
I'm looking for a course for a person who had no previous experience in programming before, is an average internet user. I watched your video about variable and I could say that this tutorial is going to fast, you're introducing too many concepts at once, speaking too fast and showing too little source code. This tutorial isn't for people who want to learn python as their first programming language, but for someone who is already competent in another language. I wouldn't say it's suitable for bootcamp for beginners. Anyway, looks good for me, and I'm going to watch it, thanks.
I haven't used Jupyter, but PyCharm is free for educational use and a fantastic product in my opinion. If you're getting started and have the opportunity, get familiar with both and see what works best for you.
No, but we love free stuff, so it kinda balances out.
When adding to cart this is showing 90% off to me not 100%. Shows as wanting 20 dollars for course right now with attached link at least for me. It is more than likely worth it but not what post is saying should be happening.
What kind of source files are you working with? XML, CSV, Excel, etc? What DBMS do you work with (source or target)?
Your code tags are broken and you should head to /r/learnpython/ for questions regarding "how I do this or that" in python, just like it says in the sidebar.

Usually most libraries would be able to specify a "weight" which numerically distinguishes light 200 from normal 400 from bold 800 from blacktext 1200. But all I find is an "index" which helps select sub-fonts within the same font source file. Try adding a third argument to `ImageFont.truetype()` with values like 0, 1, 2, 3. I expect one of them will be the normal, one will be the bold, and maybe others for italics and bold+italics.

Pyflame (or python-flamegraph as fallback) Classic profilers as included in the stdlib have 3 issues as far as I'm concerned: they're too low-level (produce too much detail and not enough overview), they don't handle recursions &amp; call cycles well and they have too high a performance impact. The first means it's very issue to miss the forest for the trees, flamegraphs provide high-level overview by default and make it much easier to notice meta-issues (though classical profilers can be useful for cross-cutting issues); the second makes it much harder to understand what is happening; the third can distort measurements so much you're optimising the irrelevant because the performance profiles

Well, there you have it: you write Markdown, then use ipynb as an intermediate format for a final viewer, which deconstructs the file into HTML. Why not go directly from Markdown to HTML?

ipynb can serve two purposes: 1. be viewed by nbviewer online: here it can use only js plugins, 2. be run in Jupyter: here it can also use python back end interactively. In order to achieve 2. via md/html we should define some Markdown standard that is later converted to ipynb. Maybe add some yaml blocks for every cell like notedown does it. And the main part: to add such md-&gt;ipynb converter to the Jupyter notebook. I bet it would be a plugin for Jupyter so in order to use that output format the end user should install additional python module. It looks too bothersome to me. I prefer modify only nbviewer and go with current Jupyter Markdown standard.
Thanks
Hey man! Been following along with the webscraping as that is relatively new to me. I think the order is a bit mixed up in this section. Nr. 40 should be in front of Nr. 38 at the very least. Thanks again!
 while x := prepare(): complex_verbose_stuff(x) is incorrect, you need to use parentheses: while (x := prepare()): complex_verbose_stuff(x) Which in my opinion is a nice demonstration of my gripe with this PEP. The same could've been achieved with a much more pythonic syntax.
By the way: I can even use pandoc-crossref when writing the document. Then export to Jupyter compatible Markdown. The fact that most of html is a valid Markdown is very convenient thing: I should not really bother about output Markdown flavor if I can export any flavor I like to that output Markdown flavor: absent features are simply exported as html (sometimes there are [bugs](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/issues/4677) but they are eventually fixed).
Regarding PEP505 (I actually haven't read it, just found about it here). In the example first = list_of_things?[0] if the list is None, I suppose 'first' becomes None. That would lead to a lot of question marks down the road. Also, once the program breaks at runtime, finding the actual variable that started the None chain becomes more complicated than it is now. One solution could be first = '' ?? list_of_things?[0] I guess. Did I just answer my own question?
Well Jupyter seems like a tool for learning, and PyCharm reminds me of Visual Studio, you know, something more serious. I'm not sure if you're able to develop something more complex in Jupyter or in Pycharm, but it's nice for learning. I got used to Jupyter so i'll continue to use it. If someone has some recommendations, feel free to express yourself. Still learning, any advice is appreciated :)
You should definitely post this to some chess subreddits!
do you have some sort of move/file size ratio?
Approximately 200 KB per move as i tested
Check it out you say
By the way: do you know how convenient is python support in R Markdown?
One thing to note: just because a PEP exists don't necessarily mean that it's ultimately going to be accepted. One example of this might be PEP 505, None-aware operators. That PEP has been open for roughly 3 years or so and is currently in a state of limbo: from what I remember, the core devs generally agreed that the feature might be useful, but nobody could agree on the exact details/the exact spelling, so the PEP was basically placed into a state of indefinite limbo. PEPs 532 and 535 are in a similar state of limbo, if I remember correctly. I don't really think there's been any discussion about these three PEPs during roughly the past year or so -- it's unclear if it'll make it into Python 3.8, or ever, for that matter.
Very cool!!!
You can put fraudulent material on udemy (e.g. take free youtube courses and put them on udemy as paid courses) and the real creator has to buy your course to DMCA it. and udemy does a f*** about checking if their content is a fraud.
Great job
One note about part 1 of your series: You actually don't need to use specifically *type hints* in order to use dataclasses: it's sufficient to use any arbitrary *annotation* instead. So this is perfectly legal, for example: @dataclass class Foo: x: ... y: "any even and positive int" z: 42 if math.random() &lt; 0.5 else 19 I also think using type hints on data classes is only going to be useful if you also plan on type checking your code using a PEP 484 compliant type checker like mypy or pyre. After all, type hints are completely ignored at runtime: if you declare some field to be of type int, there's absolutely nothing stopping you at runtime from setting it to actually be some string. Type hints are basically equivalent to comments in this case: potentially useful, but also potentially out-of-date/misleading. (Maybe this is a all a bit pedantic, but I think it's important to distinguish between *annotations* and *type hints*, and recognize that dataclasses don't automatically give us type safety/runtime type checks for free.)
I'm quite new to Python, i've only written one functional program so far. i don't think that this will cover that much i don't know already. but recapping and get a better understanding of every aspect seems like a great idea for anyone. if you consider yourself a novice.
Great idea!
Great job. Starred) But one question: Why you named it 'pgn2gif', but not smth like 'chess2gif'?
&gt; What do you think is missing? Some common sense? Or, should I say hooray, we are going to have a fourth defective method in standard library alone to execute code in parallel? Things that are missing from C API are definitely not the ability to pass built-in functions around. You could do it since before Python 2.6, not sure exactly when wasn't that possible. The pain points in C API are, for example, the impossibility to interact with `asyncio`, the lack of data-structures / functions that would allow less copying when doing I/O. Right now buffer protocol is only half as useful as it can be. If, say, you wanted to write something like Base64 encoder, you could get access to the source as an `unsigned char*` for example (say, using `mmap`), but you will have problems with destination. If you want to send the output to something like a file or a socket, Python's C API has nothing to offer. Your best bet is to open the file / create the socket in C code, if you want it to be efficient.

That seems quite big. But I guess it's ok for a proof of concept. Did you know you could save a lot of space by encoding only the difference between two .gif frames? That would probably allow-you to represent a game from the start to the end while keeping the file to a reasonable size.

There are actually quite a few of us developers over in /r/chess. I would say if one where to add some simple instructions on how to run it in the readme most people should be able to use it :). I've been looking for such a tool myself and have a half finished implementation of it on my hard drive so will definitely be using it!
Well I don't know much about gif format but i think file size related with resolution not images theyselves.But yes I admit that file size may quite big to share.
Thanks for advice. I will post it when I add some instructions.
Neat. 
Looking at using the multiprocessing library to make a script use more of the cores in a Raspberry Pi, it's an interesting problem and I think I can get major performance increases if I'm able to change the program in a way that allows me to use multiprocessing (or even just threads, really)
Sounds like a bug. Honestly, just stop using IDLE. It's really broken on many systems, and effectively unmaintained.
Interesting and thanks. Any suggestion on what to use? 
The Spyder IDE isn't bad from what I remember. Personally I use a combination of atom as a text editor and ipython in a console for testing things out as I work 
Try it and see. But what would you want to accomplish with that?
Visual Studio Code or PyCharm are the two common suggestions. 
The construct you want is `for x in [5]*8`. Multiplying an array by an integer results in an array of a single value repeated. In this case 8 repeated 5s. You cam also accomplish this with itertools whicj would be preferable if you need to repeat a million times as you don't want to actually create an array of a million 5s.
You can convert it to an mp4. They're much more compressed. And it seems there's a handful of libraries that can make the conversion in python.
I'd like to see type hint support for [protocols](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0544/) in 3.8. (Aka interfaces) 
Python-chess library has pgn-&gt;SVG. Do you specifically need gif?
Yes. lists are iterable. When you write "for x in list", every loop, x will advance to the next object on the list. So if you have a list, you can iterate over ANY object. You might be looking for this: for x in range(1, 6) This will iterate over numbers from 1 and stop at 6. Meaning [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] Or maybe this: for x in range(5) This will iterate over all numbers from 0 and stop at 5. Meaning [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] 
Visual Studio Code with plugins is the shit, very easy to install.
I think their question is can the `x` variable above be a number as the identifier instead. If it is, the answer is no because it’s not a valid [python identifier](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#identifiers). 
Ohh! If this is true op, you've misunderstood the point of variables or loops. What are you trying to accomplish?
Upvoted for the pun 
I like the instrumentation one, depending on how the hooks are designed of course. 
I think that library doesn't generate animations 
Thank you!
Use [Atom](https://atom.io/) with [Hydrogen](https://github.com/nteract/hydrogen) for interactive executing. Also I suggest [MagicPython](https://github.com/MagicStack/MagicPython) and [python-tools ](https://github.com/MichaelAquilina/python-tools) plugins.

Maybe I'm missing the obvious, but it seems like PEP505 is a fairly rare case that doesn't need its own operator? I feel like the vast majority of cases you could do a ternary operator. From the PEP: data = data ?? [] files = files ?? [] headers = headers ?? {} params = params ?? {} hooks = hooks ?? {} Could simply be: data = data if data else [] files = files if files else [] etc. and so forth. the second example is more readable to me, and if you really need the None comparison you can do if data is not None. I guess, put another way, it's not clear to me how often the distinction between None explicitly and a false-y value comes up that we need a shortcut for it. 
Yep when I needed it I did it just as you suggested. It was the most obvious and intuitive approach
You can use [gifsicle](https://www.lcdf.org/gifsicle/man.html) to optimize gifs. Your original on Github is 810 kB, run through gifsicle with -O3 and 256 colors it's 63.1 kB, with 64 colors it's 45.5 kB, and with 8 colors it's 25.5 kB. Thats just over 3% of the original size. Have you thought about animating the chess pieces?
Well spotted, Bruce :-)
PEP 505 is horrendously unreadable and seems to solve a problem that doesn't exist. 
Seems legit.

The author appears to be clueless about the Python PEP process, e.g. "Also, PEPs have to be approved by the Grand-Master, or BDFL, before they reach approval." In reality the BDFL has been delegating that responsibility to other core devs for years for some PEPs.
Inserting python code is dead-simple (just put "python" at the beginning of the code block", but I'm not sure how good the rendering tools are for Python figure outputs for RMarkdown files. 
When I google it I see something [like this](https://stackoverflow.com/a/49556037/9071377). And it sounds as convenient as Stitch but far worse than Atom/Hydrogen.
Your statements are close but not 100% functionally identical Python 3.6.5 (default, Apr 1 2018, 05:46:30) [GCC 7.3.0] on linux Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information. &gt;&gt;&gt; b=False &gt;&gt;&gt; a=b or 2 &gt;&gt;&gt; a 2 &gt;&gt;&gt; a=b if b else 2 &gt;&gt;&gt; a 2 &gt;&gt;&gt; a=b if b is not None else 2 &gt;&gt;&gt; a False &gt;&gt;&gt;
I tried writing something that drew arrows to show moves , but I got bored. That would also be a great feature to add.
right, that's what I meant by the line after. On the case where you need to be explicit about None (and not just false-y) you can use is not None (which is more readable to me imo). At least in my experience, times where you need to be explicit about None are rare enough that having an operator that will be unfamiliar to beginners seems like it detracts from readability! 
You may have better luck just using [COM](http://pbpython.com/windows-com.html)
It seems that your comment contains 1 or more links that are hard to tap for mobile users. I will extend those so they're easier for our sausage fingers to click!

I could certainly see it being handy when scraping or interacting with poorly designed REST/etc APIs (the absolute bane of my life). It's not going to be life changing IMO, it's just a small sprinkling of syntactic sugar. I'm not going so far as calling it poorly designed, it's quite common in modern langauges for good reasons.
Thanks for share. I will look at solutions for gif size. And yes, I looked for animations but i didn't able to find how to do it.
haha, I feel you with the REST APIs! yeah, agreed re: life changing. I dunno, I feel about it the way I do about syntactic sugar in general, I think. I've always liked Python for its readability and I prefer things to be a little more verbose, so syntactic sugar for cases like this where there's a readable and fine alternative makes me suspicious. I think "is not None" is much clearer. That said, I can just not use them and let other people move on with their lives, so I should quit being a grump probably...
I think the likely explanation is that scraping Google search results is trivial so people just write their own code to do it.
It's unfortunate that IDLE is what beginners are first exposed to. I've always really disliked it. PyCharm is probably the most powerful combination of editor + REPL, but sometimes beginners get overwhelmed by the features present in a good modern IDE. A plausible good alternative to IDLE for a beginner might just be ipython running in a command line.
I'm reasonably close to you there, but when you're 18 levels of `x if x is not None else {}` because some incompetent boob decided one endpoint can do 300 different things, it gets old, and at that point the sugar actually has some value. But it does feel fairly edge-case.
Scraping google is a pain in the ass and imo just a matter of time before you end up blocked.

This https://twitter.com/dz0ny/status/1014810438037536769 is rly annoying atm.
They seem to have abandoned the idea that explicit is better than implicit. We don't need shorthand operators for something that we can already effortlessly accomplish.
Yeah, I guess it makes sense being that I'm doing something I guarantee no one has ever done: make searching for answer to problems on stack easier for beginners/up and comers. Figured the Big data/ML or even the Technical Marketing/SEO crowd had some 'hacker' types amongst them (I use that word loosely). For them, Google is everything, their space is expanding RAPIDLY, and they certainly could never get enough data (hence, a scraper) hmm. I know I'm missing something. oh well
http://www.py2exe.org/
Not if you use the right advanced google search operators ('site':example.com, 'relatedsites':+, intext:&lt;my query&gt;). It's dumbed down regex. And with beautifulsoup/requests and others scraping through the rest should be cake (assuming you know what you're looking for).
Awesome! I've worked a great deal with powercli and always wondered if there was a python library for vsphere api. Now I've found pyvmomi. What library are you using to see your trunk ports? Is it just ssh with paramiko? I think we're going to have a network automation need soon too. 
I'd recommend https://www.pyinstaller.org/. It has both one-file and one-folder bundling options and is relatively easy to use. 
The actual scraping of links from google is fine of course, but as soon as you try to hit any kind of volume in my experience you end up blocked. You end up needing to rotate user agents and introduce random delays etc. Just ends up as a significant hassle.
You're happy too early probably. You can at most scrape 100 links (in a reasonable time span) before you get blocked. 
Visual Studio Code is great. I used Sublime Text before that
Good bot. 
IDLE needs some serious love. Not something I would ever recommend to a beginner. I would recommend PyCharm with the suggestion of not worrying about learning how to use much of it, but to focus on writing and running code. The REPL is nice, and the linting is good for teaching PEP8 and catching errors a new programmer would otherwise make.
You using an api or webscraping to get the data ??
An API.
Something else to keep in mind is that the first operand will only be evaluated once. `do_op() ?? []` is nicely concise, and can't be converted to a ternary without an intermediate variable. Assuming that the None/falsey distinction is useful to you, which it definitely can be, these new operators will be very useful IMO. 
"Programmers HATE him! See how you can write better Python with these 7 weird tricks!" lol this would be so good for clickbait.

Good find! Thanks! 
Which one ? I’ve been using quandl haven’t found a decent one I can afford.
Quandl. EOD data.
Oh thanks so much! This is exactly what I was looking for. I can’t believe I didn’t look at the TrueType method, duhhhhhh. Haha I was so tired last night I guess I had just been looking at it too long. Thanks so much again! And I’ll try posting over at learnpython next time! 
Have you tried `argparse`?
Would this work? x = 0 if (y := do_op()) is None else y
w3school.in != w3schools.com
It would! Didn't even think of that. I need to start thinking what the new assignment expressions could be used for in my code... 
I'm curious what you found useful: the inconvenient-looking workaround from stack overflow or maybe Atom/Hydrogen? If the first one then I can suggest to try install Atom, Hydrogen and [file-watcher](https://atom.io/packages/file-watcher) that helps to simultaneously work in two editors (I use it for Atom/Hydrogen + PyCharm combo). With this you can test and interactively run python chunks in Atom/Hydrogen. Then debug and save the document. After that go to R Markdown and knitr it. But this might not be suitable if you need interoperation of R and Python...
This one is better-- single executable, can't beat it. 
Why did you do move validation though?
Assuming *stack* means Stack Overflow...they actually have their own API...no scraping needed 😊
I like Sublime Text 3 and Vim for quick edits and PyCharm for bigger projects with multiple files that are working together 
This is cool thing to make, but I don't think animated gifs at a fixed speed works well for chess. I'm not particularly great at chess or anything, but if I'm watching someone's example of something in chess, it takes me time to orient myself when first seeing a board (if it not start of a traditional game), try and justify why they did each move, as well as consider the alternatives after each move and consider what I would have done (and this time isn't constant; surprising moves !! take longer than forced or obvious moves). E.g., watching your three move mate, it took me like several loops through before realizing black was mind-numbingly stupid `2 ... Ke7` was (when the king wasn't checked and seemed to serve no purpose than setting up mate, or possibly freeing his Queen-pinned pawn, granted there was no threat there and even if that was a goal something like `2. ... g6` make more sense attacking the queen ).
In your readme example, why doesn't `eat_cookie` trigger `cookie_eater`, setting off an infinite cycle of gluttony?

Automate the boring stuff with python is good, but you might have better luck building your own project.
Oh I know. Their API lets you pull basic meta info. And I'm going deep. I have 200GB of xml data from their latest data dump. I'm using it to put together a machine learning model to group types of questions with types of posts, comments, and answers on a given question. Including sentiment analysis and several other models to map to questions asked, how they're being asked, and how the solution/answer was given (answers/comments). Many, many more layers involved. Still developing as I build. But I have big plans for this shit: I will find my answers when I need them. I just have to find what's hidden in millions of lines of text, tags, and other metadata.

Technically this code snippet is redundant, assuming you are on Python 3, and can be simplified further to: reductor = dispatch_table.get(cls) if reductor: rv = reductor(x) else: rv = x.__reduce_ex__(4) Because every new-style class has the `__reduce_ex__` method which by default calls `__reduce__` which by default is inherited from `object`. Python devs are aware about that, but this has not been done yet. Nevertheless, the original example perfectly marks the main idea: The logic of this code is flat (like a switch) but the visual structure is pretty nested. Therefore, the main gain from using the assignment expression in these patterns of code is that the *visual syntax emphasizes the semantics* and it is important for me. To be honest, I do not see any benefit of usage of assignment expression outside \`if\` and \`while\` headers, but if others do see let it be so.

Just checked it out. Pretty cool. Nice small lib man :)

You need to run your Python file using the Python interpreter. Sounds like you’re just double clicking the Python file. You might want to look into setuptools in order to install and run it and keep track of any deps, but it would still need to be run via the command line or shell. Otherwise you’ll need to use something to create an executable from your Python code like others have suggested.
Oh ok thanks for the info! I'll head over to /r/learnpython

I know that it doesn't suit for dissect a game.But if you want to share game you played it is good option i think. Btw white queen fork king and rook with 3.Qxe5+ if 2...g6 would played. 
Great job, starred!
Thanks a lot.
What problem in particular did you have?
Although your post belongs more to r/learnpython, it reminds me when I started learning Python, I was so amazed by all the small tricks which make writing a program easy, fast and elegant to read. The more you'll learn, the more you'll love it :)
Heya! Cool program, thanks for sharing! I am still learning, so it's always nice to see what other people are doing. I did have a couple questions though: Might I ask why your function arguments have their type associated with them? Also, what is with the arrow explaining the output in the function definition line? I thought that python didn't need any of that information for functions. I've not actually come across it before. Though, as I said, I'm definitely still learning.
`from __future__ import braces`
Thanks for the offer. Unfortunately it's sold out. I guess next time!
No.
These are type annotations for python : https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html To answer your question, it declares the arguments type and the function's return type It's not mandatory of course, but it's a great help, especially in larger codebases
&gt;Other than that, great job! Thanks! &gt;Why'd you use BS4 for getting the words? That seems a bit heavy for something like this. If you're on a \*NIX system, you probably already have a dictionary file available locally to pull words from. Thanks for the observation, I made the changes, it still uses bs4 for Windows or for words in Spanish.
Is there any consequence if you pass in the wrong type? Or is it basically a descriptive comment?
Just throwing [cx_freeze](https://anthony-tuininga.github.io/cx_Freeze/) into the ring too. I've had good experiences with it at work.
It's probably not the greatest idea to get all your information from a single site.
A degree?

As a Python beginner, this is a great tutorial. Thank you. Loved the Pimpin Ain't Easy bit too btw.
Maybe go a brain dead version to start, and convert the image to just a 2d array of some sort, and then just search the array for the values (a range of values to account for slight differences) you're looking for? One that works, convert to numpy or something for speed?
Even if the you could find all this info in one place, you would need to have worked on a dozen of projects to be a considered a professional programmer. My advice is to start the working on projects. Build something that you can show off. There is a lot to programming than meets the eye. Only when you get down to developing and writing code will you discover many of the nuances with programming. At least that has been my experience. On the note of finding one place with all the info, I think Tutorials Point ([https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/index.htm](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/index.htm)) is pretty decent.
Take courses at your local CC 
Had to reread the title and check the sub because I wasn't sure why anyone but a poacher would want to paralyze pandas.
Cool, it would be neat to be able choose how fast it moves. 
Ahh I see, so does your gif maker handle that game correctly then?
You're likely better off asking this at /r/cscareerquestions 
I see a lot of the same suggestions here that I often see but I kind of wonder why more people do not suggest using a `__main__.py` file and zipping the directory. I've used it before on my mac and it seems pretty good. The hardest thing is if I wanted to load some additional data, I have to make sure to use `zipfile` or something. It *does* still require the user have python and all of the non-standard modules, but it does seem like an option often overlooked
The coupon code entered has sold out. Aw man...was looking forward to this :(
cx_freeze is great, but the only problem is that you can’t convert them into a one-file executable, even for small scripts.
The language is much less important than the principles.
Yes completely.
Nice work. One thing that might make the visuals easier to tract would be to add something like a red square around the spot that the piece left and its destination. It would make each move more distinctive with the speed that the gif runs. Might just be my old slow brain trying to keep up. But nice work! 
Odin Project
Everyone's linking stuff, as far as I'm aware pyinstaller is built in. You literally open up the console and type "*pyinstaller my_app.py*". I'd recommend against a single executable though, it basically unzips the entirety of python into the temp folder each time you load the exe, which is obviously quite a bit slower.
Interesting! I hadn't encountered that before in python. It does seem like it would be useful for sprawling and complex projects. Thanks!
I've been having to include a bunch of "extra" stuff (executables, drivers, etc.) so I didn't think of single file as important I guess. I just think the cx script to build executables makes it easy to grab exactly what I need and put it where it should be. It also offers an msi option and patching which can be handy, but probably overkill for OP.
Very good idea,thanks. Definitely will consider it.
For nontechies it would be nice to add some more instructions to the Readme, like an example command to generate the example gif.
tl;dw 1. enumerate() 2. zip() 3. x, y = y, x 4. {}.get('key', 'default\_value') 5. for: else: 6. with open() as f: 7. try: except: else: finally:
Yeah, if you have bigger programs with lists of parts, cx_freeze is a great option
OP asked: &gt;Just wondering if there's a way to make the program executable immediately by everyone. Your suggestion: &gt;*does* still require the user have python and all of the non-standard modules
Why is it people PMme think software development takes less time to learn than cooking or balloon animals. I mean wtf ...
There a lot of great resources online, and searching for and comprehending those resources is a key skill for a programmer and many other professions. Another key skill for programmers is breaking big problems into smaller ones, so breaking your problem/request into smaller pieces would not only help you get better answers, but would be a great exercise. Consider your interests and topics you might already be familiar with. To help you out, here is a [curriculum that organizes and links out to a bunch of other resources](https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university). Unfortunately, it won’t be the only site or resource you’ll ever need to spend time on. It may not even work for you in terms of your current progress and learning style. I’m sure some people would disagree with how it’s organized and what it places emphasis on. It recommends a lot of books, which are sometimes quite expensive, so it may not work for your budget, either. Even if it doesn’t work for you, it will help you focus your search but excluding topics you have no interest in or that are too easy or difficult for you. Every programmer is different and no one programmer knows everything, so you might as well tailor your learning plan to yourself. Good luck! 
Dude, nicely done!
My point is who would try to make a gif of a possibly invalid game

In what? I've worked with or have known programmers who have had degrees in English and music, both having got an MSc in computing after, German, geology, chemistry, history, geography, possibly others. What it gets down to is easy. Writing code is simple. Writing good code is way more difficult. Designing systems before you start coding is another level again. Been there, seen it, done it, got the t-shirt, very hard work.
PEP 505 is still at draft status. It might get withdrawn, it might be approved eventually, who knows, so why quote it?
So point that out on python-ideas and/or python-dev and it gets shot to pieces. Certainly to my knowledge no core dev takes a blind bit of notice of reddit as it's full of idiots who haven't a clue what they're talking about.
Because it's a lazy Saturday and when have programmers ever been known to resist the urge to comment on trivial things :p

Are you on Linux? If so then I suggest vim + command line tools. 
import pydie pydie.roll('1d6') ### ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
&gt; That would lead to a lot of question marks down the road How is that any different than things are now? It's about shortening common code. &gt; Did I just answer my own question? Also, I'd say partially. You can take just about any complicated expression and break it up to avoid parentheses, do intermediate validation, make the line shorter, etc. You can do double level list comprehensions with if-else, but it's your own fault if you can't read it. I wouldn't mind the ?? operator, but I really want the ? operator.
If you wrap the app you wrote behind a web interface, that lowers the barrier to entry to practically nothing. I'd recommend learning a little Flask and put it on Heroku.

If you want a free search API, duckduckgo can work reasonably well. Google is ferocious with blocking automated scrapers.
Make it a web application. Executable on all OSes, all devices.
I'd like to. I never have. What's the best way to do this on Debian? 
Pyinstaller isn't built in. It's a separate package that you need to install.
Either pyinstaller or if you want to do it yourself you can create a python virtual environment and create a batch/bash file to launch your script. It's a bit excessive, but it works.
If your app is smallish and doesn't need things like user accounts, databases, I'd look at Flask. If you're going to want that stuff right away, Django.
Nahhh, bro. This script returns pages with 10 links on each. So when you use the direct links they arent queries. PLus, I used to slam google with the selenium webdriver module, huuundreds of times in less than an hour. Never a block. All is good here, too. Well over 500 in the past 3 hrs.
Oh, nice! Gracias. Yeah, it's just about the smallest program possible. 
There are a lot of options to make GUI in Python: http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/scenarios/gui/ Tk is probably the most simple one.
I’ve tried following them but I can’t get it to work :/
If I remember correctly this only happens when you click to the right of a line (where there is no more text). You could try to click closer to the end of the line (closer to the last part of the text of the line) or change editors. I suggest vscode or sublimetext. 
it took me a bit longer than I thought it would to figure out what py-buzz actually does. Consider listing the features in place of the generic phrases up front.

Yes I like to implement them by myself as well, but in many geometric processing algorithms you run into too many degeneracies which can become tedious to debug after a while (e.g fortunes algorithm for voronoi diagrams)
The hard part is the IP blocking. The page itself is super easy.
I'm not against that idea but I'm not exactly sure what libraries I need to do that. I first need a way to capture a single frame directly from the webcam. Then, I need a way to interpret the image, but that I think I could do with PIL (unless you have a better suggestion). The nice thing about using PIL is I could very easily multi-thread that if I need to, though I'm not sure how efficient it is.
You can use pandas to load flat files to databases pretty easily, plus if you need to do and transforms you can easily. I’ve stuck with pandas for some etl work since I’m already familiar with the stack.
Windows doesn't have python installed by default.

Wow, GJ man! As chess player and python developer, I'm impressed. It would be cool to add more things for API.
A potential simple optimization would be to write changes for moves to a transparent layer for just the affected bounds. Tiles can only be in a couple of states and gif frames stack so it allows for a logical delta bitmap model.
That's awesome. We're a Cisco shop but there's a weird relationship with Corp IT on ownership so not sure what we're going to be allowed to do. Looking at infoblox or phpipam for ip assignment on vm deploy with terraform. I wanna use VMware as the source of truth for ansible hence pyvmomi.
awesome
Thanks. I was looking for the same thing! 
what IED are you referring to ? have you checked "conda info -e" to see where the python executables are ?
Less code means less code to read, means more readable when you get used to it. Python is often too verbose compared to other languages.

it's here - https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/c90d7c94fd2077d0beca48fa89a423da2b0bb663/numpy/random/mtrand/mtrand.pyx#L1808 see how that routine is python, but mentions rk_normal (lines 1908, 1913).
I’m working on a program that will allow me to send and receive text messages via python, but using email instead of a software like Twilio. It will be able to process text messages in real time to receive quick responses.

Beginner here. Taking intro to scripting and having an issue with something that's probably painfully simple to most of you. Currently going over escape characters and I'm trying to string together two inputs from the command line. I need to add 's to them. Easy right, \'s. Need to also create a new line \n. This is the last challenge for my week one code work and I'm pretty sure I'm about to lose my mind. I am NOT looking for any answers. Just some insight. Thanks for reading guys. My apologies if my syntax sucks. I barely know what I'm doing but I'm learning a ton. Fyi name1 = sys.argv[1] name2 = sys.argv[2] Output another string in the format With a new line between the two And where name1 and name2 are replaced with the input string name1's done and name2's done This is the correct format. Not sure if actual names are contained in the command lines. This is what I came up with as far as being as close to right as I can print (name1\'s done\nAnd name2\'s done) I can't seem to get the new line escape character to work no matter what I do. I also tried to create a new string to no avail. I know it's simple. Thanks for reading my brain damaged ramblings.

Python would be fine for this project. Consider implementing your GUI in pure HTML with a Python backend for the server side. This gets you cross platform support, resizablility, and mobile support. You can use Canvas or SVG for graphics and WebSockets for connections. If desired you can package this a mobile app or desktop software. The downside is it does mean a significant amount of Javascript work.
No fair changing the way the code works :)
 from random import randint while True: print(randint(1, 6)) if input("Press 'Y' to roll again. ").upper() != "Y": break
&gt; same since last commit That's good to hear.
How long it take you to parse that one out? I'm referring to the time since the last commit. Dude I swear programmers are all the same. At least the ones on the internet.
Does it have the advanced search operators? i.e \[insite:&lt;[example.com](https://example.com)\&gt;\], \[inurl:&lt;\*.html&gt;\] .... etc?
Late reply, but I recently encountered the same issue. The solution was painfully simple. See link: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49392719/get-the-anaconda-prompt-running-in-the-pycharm-terminal
Hello! I'm a bot! It looks to me like your post might be better suited for r/learnpython, a sub geared towards questions and learning more about python. That said, I am a bot and it is hard to tell. I highly recommend posting your question there. Please follow the subs rules and guidelines when you do post there, it'll help you get better answers faster. *** ^(this bot is written and managed by /u/IAmKindOfCreative) ^(This bot is currently under development and experiencing changes to improve its usefulness)
Yep! Good stuff!
It's harder to get involved with the process of discussion than should be necessary. Mailing lists are annoying to follow, sign up for, and you are under constant pressure to fight for your point while all those who agree with you won't speak up because they haven't checked recently / aren't signed up. Not to mention the BDFL style of Python where if wanted one man can overrule all (which while I like assignment expressions, is basically what happenee). They should really just have these kinds of discussions on an issue board, ex on Github.
Mainly Excel and csv processing. I work in accounting. Two non-toy uses I have rolled out in my organisation: 1. Taking a csv export from accounts payable system and adding/adjusting a few columns to make it able to be imported by the accounting system (remove user error/intervention) 2. Taking a spreadsheet, enriching the data using PETL, and generating a whole bunch of docx student forms.
Can you explain what exactly this is? I don't really understand what all this is about. Why is web-scrapping so amazing? 
So, I don't get why the multiple interpreters thing is a PEP at all. * the C API AFAIK already exists and there are wrappers over this, and it sucks * this is basically an extended version of [code](https://docs.python.org/3/library/code.html) * this adds another layer of concurrency in Python to learn We already have to learn about threading, then because Python is special we have to learn about multiprocessing. Then we have to learn about concurrent.futures, which personally is the best thing I've seen so far. Then we have to learn about asyncio, which is concurrency at the software level using context switching in an event loop, which by the way, we need to learn to use it in threads, processes. Many people will at some point need to learn about green threads, but that doesn't exist in the stdlib. But we get this half assed bullshit? Sending code back and forth between an object that acts at a level between Threads and Processes? Even if such a thing was to be implemented, which could be a nice thing if done properly, who in the world thought it would be a good idea to pass strings around as the executed code? That just makes things so unreasonably complicated.
572's idea has been run around for a while too. You also have to remember just because it's existed for years and never passed, doesn't mean that our BDFL can't say fuck it, ignore all opposition, and will it into existence on a whim (which while I like assignment expressions, is an adequate description of what happened).
 import os help(os)
Very close, but it has to be `x if x is not None else default` because your expression allows the first if it is anything truthy. Don't know off the top of my head if there's a meaningful difference or not. Similar expressions can be made for attribute access or indicing/slicing, just access on the first reference, don't in the conditional, default as normal. Normally I'd be against this sort of thing because it's pure syntactic sugar. And while I really am almost convinced by how much shorter some of my ternaries would be, this is just too niche. This is an explicit shorthand not for ternaries, but for the specific ternary condition being `x is not None`. That's one possible ternary out of nearly infinite because of at-runtime reference equivalence checking based on arbitrary input. I don't think it's enough to justify syntactic sugar like this unless there would be some super duper performance improvement.
I think that's because Python is in the rare group of languages where the type is defined after rather than before a variable name. The colon typing syntax was okay in parameter lists, but then they allowed it on variables and it just seems weird. Not to mention all the people coming from something like JS thinking they are writing a dictionary only to notice they forgot the braces and now they are annotations / syntax error.
Thanks! Yeah there are actually quite a few of these "comprehensive programming" githubs. Basically starting from the bare basics of hell world, data types, arrays, functions and then starts ramping it up creating your own data structures and algorithms. Then takes it up another notch to image processing/data analysis, then A.I. I think programming is kinda of hard to organize because it doesn't follow a linear structure. There are a lot of routes one can go towards and specialize in.
Try following a tutorial series. [This is just one](http://zetcode.com/gui/tkinter/). GUI programmimg is in some sense "inverted" and requires a slightly different mindset. You just define the components of the GUI screen and then wait for events from the user. Try using tkinter. Most of the GUI frameworks are similar in the way they work. Knowing how tkinter works will help with PyQt and wxpython, for instance.
Thanks for some kind of constructive criticism. Everyone is so positive about it to the point that I don't know what to think. It's statistically unlikely that this is the best tutorial in existence, so a little negative feedback helps the rest of us understand strengths and weeknesses.
If course, there's the [XKCD algorithm](https://m.xkcd.com/221/): response = 'Y' while response == 'Y': print(4) response = input('Press "Y" to roll again. ').upper()
&gt;You may **check** it here *\*sigh\** upvote.
&gt; objects that will be analyzed HOW will they be analyzed. Step #1 is to write an algorithm that works, and then figure out how to optimize it from there. &gt; 1080p@30FPS If you are going to be writing this algorithm yourself from scratch (instead of using some pre-baked library call to something lower-level), then python is the WRONG tool for this job. Have you figured out the I/O. Can you get that many pixels from your camera to your CPU in realtime without bottlenecking anything else? Why 1080p? Are the optics good enough so that your camera is pixel-limited? &gt; X/Y axis of a certain paint color for every frame How much tolerance do you have on the paint color. Is the color unique in each frame. If so, you can simply search for the first pixel with that color (within some tolerance). You have 62 million pixels to search per second, and a 1.8GHz CPU, so that should be do-able.
You didnt link anything
Have you heard of pipenv?
yeeeup, vpn takes care of than. bandwidth usage for google searches is next to nothing. So that solves it!
You would be correct. Naysayers be scorned
Success story (also, a totally minor thing with a well documented API): About nine months ago, someone screwed up. He’s not with my company anymore, but ever since he screwed up, a job has been running with a variety of granted authorities in AWS in one of our large multinational company’s AWS infrastructure’s automated job processing infrastructure’s accounts. Thank you, architects. That job has quietly been putting 1 to 2 mb files in an S3 bucket owned by one account. Those files are an archive of our daily transaction load. Those jobs run from our ETL platform and use industry best practices to place information where our data warehouse is best able to consume it. But they’re placed by many accounts. Welp, That takes us to about two weeks ago. Two weeks ago, one of our subsidiaries tries to load all that data into one thing. That thing coughs and says it can’t read from the other thing. After a bunch of monkeyshines, it ends up on my desk. A little research indicates that all of that information has been written to one AWS account’s bucket with a whole panoply (apt description, look up the formal definition) of accounts. None of which granted full permission to the bucket owner’s account, which means that the bucket policies weren’t inherited to the key. That, right there, is the issue. No grant full control or anything. There’s millions of objects. And by millions I mean hundreds of millions, although falling sadly short of the descriptive power of the fabled “billions.” I’m sure there’s someone who is currently undergoing a private hell as they realize their Euro accounts were placing files their data warehouse cannot ingest. I’m so sorry, I caught this after only a “few” months. But two boto3 scripts later, I had one that would index files into a queue to be evaluated and another that would evaluate the scripts. It was almost magic. Thanks, guys, for making what could have been a painful learning experience for a big publicly traded company into a win for a new guy. 
That's what I thought of also.
This is amazing, I haven't found a single bug or unnecessary feature!
Thanks again, very helpful.
I finally finished writing a company Slack bot which tells us which food trucks are coming every day at 10:30 AM. Best part is, we can see the trucks outside our window so this bot saves me, at most, 20 seconds of effort a day. It uses a [client I wrote](https://github.com/clintval/seattle-food-truck) around the Seattle Food Truck API which is incredibly over-engineered IMHO. If you're in Seattle give it a shot. It uses concurrent programming and comes bundled with a command line utility :p
For our anniversary last year I took all the text messages my girlfriend and I sent each other and turned them into a word map. It was easy enough using an app to extract the text message strings (I have an iPhone), pandas and some visualization library I’m now forgetting. Anyway, she loves it, I framed it and it’s now right by her bed.
Woah this is a really good idea. May I know what did you use to build the map ?
Great idea. I got a spare raspberry pi. I like your light idea
Dude you forgot to include the link, or maybe it's a joke so will done.
Having massive amounts of data is the only way to find reliable **trends** (keyword!). Small sets of data increase the likelihood/probability that a trend will appear randomly, without significance. Mass data is the opposite: if you see a trend in mass data, it cant be random (or at least it's HIGHLY unlikely) - and that means it provides **insight,** valuable information (depending on the context). The insight can tell us when/whether/how to make a decision. Or, it could point to another **correlating** trend. Here are thousands of examples, have fun :) [Google Trends](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=honey&amp;geo=US) # How do we get "mass data"? Think of it like this: instead of using your internet browser to manually visit 10,000 websites to gather/copy-paste data (which would take months/years) - you can use code to do the same thing in seconds/minutes/hours depending on the scale. Then, you look for trends in that data (a particularly sophisticated mathematical/statistical process) &gt;!Examples:!&lt; Find out when to buy a stock - right before it's value goes up. * Scraping stock market prices over the years to find a **trend** where a certain stock goes up shortly after a number of other stocks fluctuate to the same degree. * This would give you **insight** into when you should buy the stock to sell shortly after for a profit Non-analytical uses: * Scraping the web to find public contact for a certain group of people, say corporate executives. You could host the information on a paid website/app and sell the access to corporate sales teams that sell to high-level corporate personnel The possibilities are endless. It's why you can quite grasp it (hopefully you're starting to now!). If you poke around studying analytics/reading examples long enough, you will inevitable feel it sink in.
This is my first post. There was a link tab. Now I added the link.

I tried with a VPN and I got banned anyway after a few attempts. I guess it depends on the provider. Which vpn are you using?
So x = (y := do_op()) ?? 0
Yeah sorry for you hard work dude but pipenv does all that and more. It’s recommended by guido himself lol
I use tunnelbear. Were you using the script I posted here?
Take it easy :)
VPN proxies don't do much if you don't edit headers/cookies *specifically* based on what google looks for + wait for and respond to scipts/requests. Your browser likely has plenty of extensions that point to your real IP basically making your VPN useless unless you handle the requests exactly as a real user would
I implemented my own scraper, with user agent rotation and delays &lt; 1s. I also used a bunch of the headers a browser would send. Got banned after ~ 50 queries 
i already know python,and i have never studied VBA, and i am doing internship and have to complete the work in next 9 days,so i was thinking if another package of python could be helpfull.
Firstly, pat yourself on the back, because learning Python is one of the best things you can do ! secondly, my take on this is that ... firstly, decide for yourself your motives. Meaning, decide what you wanna develop or create using Python. **Don't look at others ! Decide for yourself what it is that interests you.** If you like Python then sky is the limit, really. There's very little that you can't do with Python. Web development (Django, Flask, Pyramid, ...), Game development (pygame for 2D, Panda3D for 3D games), Network programming, Software development, GUIs, Robotics Development and the list goes on .... Speaking of resources. None of those resources you've mentioned are bad. You'll learn something interesting using each of those. Personally, I'd recommend this book [https://www.amazon.co.uk/Learning-Python-Mark-Lutz/dp/1449355730/ref=sr\_1\_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1531034109&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=learning+python](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Learning-Python-Mark-Lutz/dp/1449355730/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1531034109&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=learning+python) it is rather extensive (over 1500 pages) but only because this book is meant to be covered as a semester. The author even says that you should give yourself 6 months to get grasp on the content. It's not meant to be a crash course. Perhaps you'll agree that crash courses aren't always the best, especially if you're trying to understand something on the deeper level. Crash courses are meant to give you introduction to the topic and get code somewhat running but if you're seeking deeper understanding you need to go for a book or extensive online course on Coursera. Always look for what it covers and just use your common sense. **But first decide what it is that you want to develop with Python** and take your learning journey from there.
&gt;thank you :)
&gt;I am working as an Intern in a company. I have to do a job in next 9 days .the job is - &gt; &gt;I have to call python from excel and populate all data with python so have to write formulas in python script and macros too. &gt; &gt;I am using ppackages like pandas, numpy to calculate the data and transfer data from excel to python. &gt; &gt;Should I use xlwings or pyxll? to record macro. and have to create A front end button in excel which should do the calculation, calling python, and return values in excel. &gt; &gt;and if i use pyxll ,as its nt free and i use it and complete the work in trial version of one month, as i dont have to use more than that, can the people viewing the results/output face any problem in future??
From an engineering standpoint, no it isn't, that job is too short to ever benefit from multiprocessing (short of running a hundred+ of those operations). From a learning perspective, go ahead and do it! It's a decent project to learn it on.
This looks like a huge overhead specially having pyenv 
lol nah. You need to hear it. Putting up with the internet-programmer community that - *without question -* goes out of their way in a group effort to deliver newer coders with an onslaught of battering condescension, abject indecency, and general discouragement in the event no opportunity for the others. This stard group-bullying behavior tacked on at least 4 months to my learning curve. Likely closer to 5 or 6. I just didn't ask questions. Posting to SO and dealing with the beatdown or suffering through a week of endless googling was no contest. Yeah, the questions were so basic they could be explained in a minute by one of you. Instead, they were explained with a &gt;"*marked as duplicate by xxElite\_FULLSTACK\_Elitexx and and 15 others*" Don't know How I didn't quit. I wonder how many others have. I do not see them as weak by any means. I just refused to give in to this internet gang culture with one message: "*Noobies*: *Just hang it up already. you'll never be us. Stop trying. You look stupid. Go try Photoshop working with excel*" I am very, very jaded. Should almost thank you, it's where a lot of my fuel came from. Start treating people with respect. of how they measure up to you in your frame of thinking.
Using google to find "python julia fractal" literally gave me 3 different solutions in the first 5 hits... [http://0pointer.de/blog/projects/mandelbrot.html](http://0pointer.de/blog/projects/mandelbrot.html) [https://scipython.com/book/chapter-7-matplotlib/problems/p72/the-julia-set/](https://scipython.com/book/chapter-7-matplotlib/problems/p72/the-julia-set/) [https://batchloaf.wordpress.com/2013/02/10/creating-julia-set-images-in-python/](https://batchloaf.wordpress.com/2013/02/10/creating-julia-set-images-in-python/) Haven't tried any of them, but you should at least get a couple of pointers...
Check out r/learnpython
All of the above. Each thing has it's own set of strengths and weaknesses. My thing, don't focus on any of them too much and figure out how to create deployable models instead. Actually deploying what you create is much harder than making things faster.
&gt; Yeah sorry for you hard work dude but pipenv does all that and more. I had the exact same experience as OP when checking out pipenv, could not find any way to easily switch between and use multiple environment for the same directory/project. If you have actual sources for your claims rather than dismissive quips, it would be very kind of you to provide them. &gt; It’s recommended by guido himself lol That means jack shit, especially when it can't do the job I need of it.
Can't find. Will you please help. Much appreciated! 
Reddit allows posts to be *either* links or text (text being self-posts). The tab lets you switch between the two, but you can't do both at the same time.
&gt;Can't find. Will you please help. Much appreciated! ??? I included the link in my post. All you have to do is click on it.
I clicked. And there are many posts. Could not find the solution i was lookin for. 
Yeah, that's sad :( 
Yup, I mentioned the is not None explicit thing right after my false-y lines (I should have highlighted it in a code block too). There are certain cases where you need the explicit comparison, as u/colloidalthoughts pointed out (as in databases or poorly designed REST APIs), but I agree that it's unnecessary syntactic sugar. Then again, I guess that's where the wiggle room lies (I.E. what is niche / too niche to deserve something like this), and what we rely on the core devs for!
If you can make numba work, then more power to you. I find it only works on pure python data. I'd rather just use numpy/scipy as their algorithms are better than mine.
1: /r/learnpython 2: google come on, dude.
I've done some extensive work in numba. It's great up to a point. I particularly like that you can just remove the decorator to work in python, to make sure your code is correct. The first main problem is that inside your numba code you can't easily use all the amazing other libraries. Need an nlsolver in your code? Write one. Need sparse matrices? Implement them. Now, if exposing other libraries in terms of low level callables[1] catches on, that might be mitigated somewhat. But the second problem, and maybe the more fundamental one for cython and numba is that you are writing code in a c level language. No abstractions, no bounds checking, no dictionaries, no nothing. That's fine for fixing occasional hotspots, but for anything that gets larger it's a pain. So it really depends on your specific use case.

I'm all aboard the "replace matlab with python" train. I've been trying to convert some disciples at my workplace as well. The libraries are a good argument, but I feel an even better one is: Matlab is a great analysis tool but a terrible software development tool. Python is a good analysis tool and a great software development tool. If our plan is to turn analysis into software, we should be doing that in Python, not Matlab. But what I came in here to ask is...why is numpy not mentioned here? With a little cython code to read the raw data and plain numpy from then on, I reimplemented some matlab code at work that ran at about the same speed.
Can you elaborate on what you mean by "deployable models"?
Matlab's IDE is really good though
Not saying much about numpy because for large matrices, simple functions that should be quick and that you do a lot of end up actually being way longer in numpy than matlab. Matlab is really really quick for linear algebra and matrix manipulation. That’s where numba and cython do wonders as well and are even better as they’re pure C code. 
And will be the goal of the Project? A project on production level will always require a technology stack. I develop web applications so I use Django framework, My first short Tutorial was this : [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6esTdOLXh4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6esTdOLXh4) Once I got into it, I moved to advance areas through usual developer's practice that involves several trials and Stack overflow. 
This Python boot camp was recently posted. The price is reduced to $12 for a limited time. https://www.udemy.com/pythonbootcamp/?couponCode=THANKSREDDIT
Can you please give an example? Also, what version of blas / lapack is your numpy using?
It will include working with images so I guess I'll need knowledge of a graphics library(i think it was opencv). 
Just try a super simple 10,000 by 10,000 matrix of zeros, add 5 to every single index and compare time taken in matlab and numpy
I'm yet to work with openCV but I have heard good about them so yes definitely go for it. Once you are comfortable with it, You can try other libraries too(in order to always keep your flexibility up) 
Add 5 to each index one-by-one, in a loop? Or all at once using broadcasting? I'm not at all surprised if the first is much faster in modern matlab, but pretty surprised if the second one is.
Both are, broadcasting I did a few tests w that a week ago and it was 3-4x faster if I recall correctly. Don’t take my word on that though haha just I believe that is what I recall. 
I see you mention for loops in your post. Are you using numpy's broadcasting correctly? If you are, you shouldn't be coming across many cases where you need to loop across arrays.
Please can you extent the offer, it has sold out.
I realize I'm alone in this, but: Ugh. When forced to use matlab, I run it through `emacs`. Time I spend with my fingers off the keyboard (e.g. on a mouse) is time wasted.
Broadcasting is used for specific cases where you can apply the same function across a section... usually the case is (for me), requires that I check each value and then apply different things based on a condition. Numba / cython/ C code is great for this, matlab is alright, pure python sucks and numba is meh for that. At least from what I’ve been able to understand so far. 
Celery is an asynchronous task queue/job queue. It is commonly used to run long-running background jobs - and distribute it across a cluster of Celery workers. For example, if you needed to scrape, say, 100k websites, and then trigger a natural-language-processing task as soon as the scraping task(s), Celery would allow you to distribute that job across 100 celery workers to scrape 1k websites each in parallel and then pass the individual results onto the post-processing task. But that's just one example of many. As to Celery resources in general, there's the docs and a few blog posts and YouTube videos here and there, but it can be quite intimidating for a bigger, which is one of the reasons I wanted to start the blog. Let me know if you have a particular datascience use casein in mind, I'd be happy to write a tutorial. Thanks!
Just did your example with broadcasting and they were practically even. When I used in-place addition, numpy was 2.5 times faster.
Fair enough. I use the mouse with interactive figures. I don't know of a python equivalent to those.
Without knowing specifics I can't tell you specifics (and I'm far from an expert anyway). But I find I can usually use ufuncs/`np.vectorize()` or set up a vector ahead of time that already contains the condition and then apply it to the data. 
What was your matlab code(just curious)? I compared my python to a co worker who said the matlab code I wrote would def be slower than numpy but he gave me some simple code that seemed to be faster for the example I stated above.. I’m a noob in matlab so it’s hard for me to get accurate tests running
I haven’t done that but I’ve heard about vectorizing the data and help a ton. I’ll check that out!
I use learn x in y minutes to get a general feel for the language, then implement something simple, then read tutorials or guides that are more specific and relevant by googling. E.g. "python3 rest framework". Don't have any specific other then learnxinyminutes though, sorry. https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/python3/
The python line was: `python -m timeit -s "import numpy" -s "x = numpy.zeros((10000, 10000))" "y = x + 5"` The matlab lines were: x = zeros(1e4, 1e4); timeit(@() x + 5)
pew allows you to easily set up and switch between virtual envs. If you have one activated and run pipenv, it'll use your current environment.
imo, cython is a good choice for scalar code, numba is a good choice for vector code. - you want to do a complex but well defined operation on 2e7 points really fast? Numba. - you want to run a timeseries simulation that maintains state through 2e7 points? Go cython. Fwiw, cython can produce code as close to the metal as you want (check your code using `cython -a`) Btw, I'd also look into CUDA if you're into this sort of thing. When you get your first CUDA app flying your jaw will drop. I optimized a particular code for 80%-100% speed up using cython. When I eventually went CUDA, that number went up to x40.
So someone else can use your work/model... and not just "works on my machine" ¯\\\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
I already mentioned how the objects will be analyzed, though I guess to be more specific, I'd search for the first instance of X/Y coordinates that approximately match the RGB values I'm looking for. If I end up making this multi-threaded, I can simply cut off the processing of a thread early once it finds what it needs. Furthermore, some objects will only move on the Y axis, so, as long as I know the X, I can just scan downward. Considering I'll be scanning for at least 5 different objects at a time, these plans ought to exponentially decrease processing time. I figured Python wasn't the best language to go about doing this from scratch, though, I'm thinking Pypy *could* be the difference between unrealistic and "not the best choice, but adequate". As for the I/O, the camera normally streams this amount of data, over USB 2.0 (pre-compressed). On a 1GHz Cortex A7, I can record from this webcam at full specs and transcode to MP4 while using about 70&amp;#37; of a CPU core. Keep in mind, I intend this program to run headless. 720p might be achievable for my needs, but the higher the resolution, the better. After getting the coordinates, I need the computer to then estimate the path of the object's trajectory (this shouldn't be that hard). More pixels improves the precision of this task, but, it might not be a necessity. Honestly, a higher framerate would be more ideal but that's hard to come by for webcams.
Actually the above didn’t really state the usp of different envs. As a side note it’s generally bad practice to have different requirement between staging and prod. I’m sure your project has valid reasons

Why didn't you work on adding the features you needed to an existing open-source project instead of creating another way to manager dependencies ?
Note that numpy.vectorize isn't designed for performance (it's effectively just a for loop).

`matplotlib`
I'm working on something like this for some analysts at work who I think would like to share work (or as I call it "transfer contexts"). I think jupyter notebooks are going to do a good thing here, but I haven't quite launched it as a real project yet. Or maybe by "someone else" you mean "in production". In that case, this is exactly what I mean in another comment by turning analysis into software. This is hard in matlab but super simple in python.
Oh also: Depending on the condition, you can still do this. Say the condition depends on whether the value in the array is positive or negative. So you make two arrays, one with the positive answer and one with the negative. Then you use a `.where()` or similar to get index arrays that tell you which answer to use from which array.
Np.vectorize gives broadcasting behavior, but not performance.
&gt;From an engineering standpoint, no it isn't, that job is too short to ever benefit from multiprocessing (short of running a hundred+ of those operations). From a learning perspective, go ahead and do it! It's a decent project to learn it on. my thoughts exactly. thanks for the words of encouragement.
I don't know what you're demonstrating. What's the point of the assignment expression there?
I'm wondering if that is the equivalent of the code it was in response to?
I’d recommend taking Programming for Everybody offered by coursera. Checkout my favorite 4 resources to learn (and master) Python: http://developpython.com/index.php/2018/07/05/resources/ Good luck!
Yeah it is, but with a pointless assignment expression, so pretty much the original posted by /u/pianohacker. I meant to demonstrate that adding a second new operator to make this specific case where you really care about `None` vs falsey isn't that helpful, since we're already getting the assignment expression operator. 
Matplotlib is clunky compared to matlab imo
this is how the whole npm explosion starts I think.

If I were you, I would prototype this in Python in non-realtime (i.e. am I happy with this algorithm for a single image, for a set of images, etc.). Then I would write the actual production code in C/C++. Performance is an actual requirement and the algorithm you are proposing is simple enough that there is no reason to skimp here. Besides, if you are doing something like looping over pixels, you will need to, at bare minimum, do that part in a non-interpreted language to get anywhere close to 1080p@30fps. &gt; I can record from this webcam at full specs and transcode to MP4 while using about 70% of a CPU core yeah, but you have to be really careful about extrapolating performance stats from video decode/encode alone. That's basically dedicated hardware at this point on SOCs, so you are just doing some direct-memory transfer of the data to those transistors and then out to disk.
Right this is what I'm wondering, who are these people that need different virtual environments per project, which already to me indicates suboptimal design at the very best and also probably atrocious code. And if different virtual environments and requirements files are needed for production and development that is even worse. I'm sure their project has *justification* but I know it's valid(at least for some definition of valid), this is like when people got better control flow than "goto" and there were holy debates on whether 100% of control flows are possible with selection and branching statements or if you ever need to use a goto statement to accomplish your goals. You don't need goto statements and you don't need multiple sets of dependencies.
Not interactive, at least not in the way matlab's ones are, with gui elements like sliders. Nor is there a 3d rotate tool afaik.
TCP/IP stack.
Hmm program files?
Exactly. Pipenv pretty much should do everything you need. Multiple envs in same project? Not one of them
I have done several projects in python, including using cython (not numba, though). I got the impression that much is possible, but if you want a very fast program, it is easier to write, maintain and connect with other things if it is simply written in C/C++/Fortran. For me, fiddling around with all of pythons extra options took more developing time, and finally also more runtime. I basically use python for everything that does not need to be fast (or where python is intrinsically fast). 
Thanks! Pretty sure I used word_cloud by amueller on GitHub.
Why didn't you add the feature yourself, now that you know about it? Don't presume to lecture someone on which projects they should contribute to.
Thanks! Pretty sure I used word_cloud by amueller on GitHub.
have you heard of poetry? 
https://bokeh.pydata.org is probably your best bet for generalist interactive stuff; there are many more problem-specific tools too :)
Why should /u/craigulien contribute someone else code that he doesn’t care about? 
I studied (and still am) studying C because i flipped tables at numba. if you're planning on anything HPC related, C is where to go. 
idk what you use case is but there are some great optimization techniques that have already been implemented in scipy.optimize so apart from the joy of learning don't waste too much time re-implementing. If you are evaluating really costly functions you could look into sci-kit optimize which has some rad optimization functions. I don't have any solid advice with regards to you question though.
Super notebooks are great for demonstrating your work, and are an amazing tool for science reproducibility, but for software reproducibility they don't do much for you. Giving someone a notebook file does not guarantee they can rerun the analysis as you did.
i used Unity to make this (somewhat buggy) tetris clone: [http://jfry.info/tetris](http://jfry.info/tetris) So, I have at least some standing to make this suggestion: Unity really excels in terms of it's WYSIWYG interface. You can make a complex game without writing a single piece of C# code. However, once you start working with C#, you'll notice that Unity does some really weird stuff in terms of in-game coordinates. Many times, setting up the game space itself is the most annoying thing. For things like detecting coords of mouseclicks, you have to trust Unity's "ScreenToWorldPoint" function. I ran into an issue with my Tetris clone whereby I was trying to rotate my GameObjects when the player pressed the R key by applying a vector to the GameObject which rotated it 90 degrees. What I didn't realize (and what the UI and console log did not show) was that when I rotated a GameObject 90 degrees, the coordinates where changing from, for example, 15, 9 to 15.0000000000001, 9.00000000000001. This would obviously create issues with collision detecting. Of course, Unity offers an in-engine option for collisions, the Collider, but you'll find sometimes that finegling the Colliders can be awkward if you want some specific functionality. Unity is every bit a C# framework, down to it's most basic unit, the GameObject, from which virtually all classes you create will derive (like the native C# Object class). So, if you'd like to better your knowledge of C# (great for the workplace - lots of shops looking for C# devs these days) it's a great choice. One great thing about Unity is that there are some really good classes available on it via udemy.com. 
Yiur question is too broad, the possible answered are too wide and complicated, and you have too many steps from sheer you are to where you need to be for someone to give you a satisfactory answer. You need to start smaller. Start out asking a question like "how can I display my name in a dialog box?" 
I would definitely migrate stuff like that real software. Another place where python shines relative to matlab.

At which point, what's the relevance and point of pipenv?
 since pipm overwrites pip executable in path, please make sure that after removing pipm, install pip itself with easy_install to me this is a big nono, you should never take over a different binary even if your syntax is essentially the same. You indicate you have problems with x alternative but dont go into any details on what the actual problems were. Did you even attempt to resolve the problems or correct your workflows instead of building another new manager?
… They [literally mention it in the readme](https://github.com/jnoortheen/pipm#alternatives-and-their-problems-imho).
&gt; Why didn't you work on adding the features you needed to an existing open-source project instead of creating another way to manage dependencies ? Well [pipenv does not want to support multiple environments](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/1841) so that's one down.
There is also pypy [http://pypy.org/](http://speed.pypy.org/) It's performance is fairly amazing, and can run pure python with orders of magnitude in speedup [http://speed.pypy.org/](http://speed.pypy.org/) main downside is lack of compat with some C/C++ libs that use CPython interface
So this week I built the [Infinity Gauntlet](https://github.com/ArionMiles/InfinityGauntlet) for /r/thanosdidnothingwrong **SPOILERS FOR INFINITY WAR** They want to ban 50% of their subscribers, [](#s "just like in the movie") so I built a reddit bot along with /u/drazxie to scrape all possible usernames from the sub and put it into a database. On reddit, subscriptions are anonymous so it's not possible to moderators to obtain a list of all the subscribers, hence we had to resort to scraping. Once scraped, we randomly select half of them users and ban them.
Okay then. How to display a row/column/any data from the database into a dialog box? 
Okay, so there are a couple things you'll want to make it very easy for you to test this with a bit of a visual guide. Install the Anaconda distribution of python as it comes with everything you'll need except maybe SQLalchemy and can test it in a bit of a more visual interaction using Jupyter Lab. Basically you'll want to Google these things one by one and you'll be in business. 1. How to use jupyter lab/jupyter notebook 2. How to use pandas (just use fake data for testing and getting comfortable) 3. connect to SQL server using sqlalchemy. 4. (If you want to manipulate data in a lot of ways after one query) Pandas + sqlqlchemy from_sql function 5. Pandas.to_excel function 6. You'll probably also want to look at windows scheduler for having these tasks run automatically
Maybe some kind of web application? Built with Django or Flask? Maybe a flash card app for studying?

Still the wrong place for these types of questions. r/learnpython as it says in the sidebar. 
\&gt; Not good when we need to deploy over production server or keep multiple virtuals-envs 1. I don't understand why people have such problems with deploys to production servers. You have a freeze file and a regular requirements file. Build your docker containers from the freeze file, upgrade from the regular file. If you have totally different requirements for different environments (staging, production, etc.) then your development process is broken. The only possible exception is deploying the same project to different operating systems which is such an edge case to be not really worth publishing a solution. 2. I don't really understand why you need multiple virtualenvs for a single requirements.txt/project. If you're running a project in different virtualenvs you either have multiple projects which should have their own requirements OR you're testing against multiple environments, in which case there is [tox](https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). I'm afraid you're just littering up the package landscape like most other package creators.
Sidebar.
A lot of interesting libraries that I can use. This is great. 
I really got exited when first heard about pipenv, but using that was itching, the locking process took so much of time. For many reasons I still needed requirements.txt . So I just wrapped existing tools. Nothing new. No need to install pipm in remote servers.
I tried them and always needed requirements.txt one way or another. This doesn't add anything new. Just wraps around existing libs/tools. 
Hell yeah! Tomorrow is the day when you will feel what is it like to lose to feel so desperately that you’re right, yet to fail nonetheless. 
Literally anything. Think about every single piece of software that runs on computer, phones, tablets, anything. You can make absolutely anything. It's a programming language. You question is like saying "What kind of building can I build if I have building materials?". The answer is, all of them. You can build any kind of building you want. You have all the bricks, wood, nails, screws, etc. Every building blocks you need.
When installing Anaconda for the first time did you install for only your user or for all users? If the latter, it could be under program files instead of your user folder. 
I just build a sdist with poetry (it auto generates manifests and setup.py) and use shiv to package it with all dependencies into a single executable zip file, which I can put in a docker container or distribute very easily. 
Right I just mean why I dislike this is None-awareness is something I rarely have to check for, but I do many ternaries. That's why I feel such a thing is too niche-- not only is it syntactic sugar only but it solves a super minor piece of longer code.
It was working great on my local machine. But when I switched to container and did \`poetry install\` it was saying missing dependencies and failed to install any. For example, I locked pytest-mock to file but it failed with \`mock\` being not locked or something like that. When I added mock to pyproject.toml explicitly (though it is not necessary), next time it raised issue regarding missing \`funcsigs\`. I don't remember the exact name but this is how my experience ended in server. As a note these are default modules in Python3 and should not be checked when Py3 is active. But as said in one of the issue regarding this, these packages are not marked correctly.
Numba vectorize is, on the hand, designed for performance, giving you just compiling and parallel execution over the array.

A good one. Does that suit here?. It is not adding any new file format as a way to keep the meta data. Just pip install/uninstall. Nothing fancy , no lock file, ... Things that I wished to be part of pip or pip-tools to do. 
Depending how I go about this, I don't see what difference it makes whether I do this in C(++) or not. The most CPU-taxing part should be the library itself. Libraries like pygame, PIL, and OpenCV involve pre-compiled binaries that do most of the work. Python effectively is just a vessel to access them. However, I do understand that my approach to interpreting the pixels is potentially very slow on python itself. Again, pypy might fix this, though I don't know how good of an idea that is. Anyway, on the single-core Cortex-A8 system, I just ran a few tests. It seems to be completely crippled just by reading from the webcam via Pygame (not displaying anything, not outputting anything, not interpreting anything - just simply grabbing frames). So, Pygame is simply not an option. If I use PIL to grab the RGB value of every pixel, that's even slower (but, that doesn't really surprise me). I haven't tried pypy because I have Debian installed on this system and apparently the Debian devs have made pypy practically useless. &gt; That's basically dedicated hardware at this point on SOCs, so you are just doing some direct-memory transfer of the data to those transistors and then out to disk. Actually, this specifically *wasn't* hardware-accelerated. Besides, what I'm trying to do is still all in shared memory, with no disk writing. That being said, the horrible frame rate from Pygame's webcam frame grabbing seems a bit abnormal to me, even on such a low-end system.
Frankly I think you're in cloud cuckoo land. The vast majority of professional programmers in this day and age are dictated to by costs as in development time. Runtime speed for most programs is irrelevant, developer time and time to market crucial. Simple fact, if run time speed was that important, Python wouldn't be sitting where it is in all the major indexes that measure the popularity of computer languages. Also note that it's got there without having a massive sales and marketing budget.
My goto library for this is [zope.cachedescriptors](https://pypi.org/project/zope.cachedescriptors/).
&gt; I think that's because Python is in the rare group of languages where the type is defined after rather than before a variable name. I haven't got the faintest idea what that is meant to men. Please clarify, thank you.
&gt;I guess, put another way, it's not clear to me how often the distinction between None explicitly and a false-y value comes up that we need a shortcut for it. It's sufficiently common that I think I'd describe your replacement as a bug waiting to happen in a lot of cases. There's a lot of situations where we really care that it **is** None. Eg. Your examples are common in the context of something that cares about appending to the existing data/headers/hooks if any, and only if that hasn't been provided/initialised, create a new one and use that. In that context, your example has *different behaviour* from an explicit `is None` check, in that it'll do something different when someone passes in an empty list/dict. The `is None` version will reuse the existing empty list, while you'll discard it and create a new one. Now, you might think - "So what, I replaced an empty list with a different empty list - the **value** is the same regardless", but that's only the case if no-one else has a reference to the original value. And sometimes that'll be the case, and this behaviour will lead to bugs, even before we get into actual *type* differences. And those type differences could matter too. Eg. someone makes a mistake, and passes the wrong value. Eg. "False", or "0". It'd be better if this failed so they'd know they did the wrong thing, as would happen when something tries calling '.append()' on an integer, but here it'll work for coincidental reasons. As such, I'd say you should pretty much never accept any falsey values when you really care about None-ness - sometimes it'll actually matter and directly lead to bugs. Of course, as you say, you can (and *should*) just use: data if data is not None else [] and you'll be bug-free, but this *is* a little more verbose, hence why some might want a shortcut. And there are further common shortcuts with the "?." notation etc. It's pretty common to do stuff like: if x is not None: x.do_something() Or even nested versions like: if x is not None: y = x.get_y() if y is not None: y.do_something() Where x?.get_y()?.do_something() can be a lot more concise.
Java: int n = 5; for (Integer n: intArrList) // stuff C: int main () {} Same for C++, and more. But in python, n: int = 5
Did you try using the &lt;pre&gt; tag? `&lt;pre&gt;{element}&lt;/pre&gt;`. Unforunately it doesn't have colors but it's the default code embedding system with HTML.
You should create an element with CSS, so you can customise it as you want.
It'd be nice if the plot control (e.g., changing color, line thickness, etc., title) was better in matplotlib's toolbar, but it's honestly not that hard to code. It's just I keep throwing it away or have to find it. There is most certainly 3d capability that's quite good in matplotlib.
Hi there, this post has been removed as it is not directly related to the Python programming language. It might be more topical on /r/programming, /r/coding, or /r/technology. Cheers, /r/Python mods
Matplotlib has a toolbar? I've been coding it all from scratch (though usually I use seaborn). What IDE do you use that has a toolbar for matplotlib?
I'm hairy on this, but how does this work: const void * PointClass; void initPointClass(void) { if (! PointClass) { PointClass = new( Class, "PointClass", Class, sizeof(struct PointClass), ctor, PointClass_ctor, 0 ); } } You are checking an un-initialized pointer, hoping that it will be NULL, but then you are also assigning to a const pointer... Does this stuff compile? Although I don't think it's a mistake to define a function like this, normally, you only need to specify that function takes no arguments in a function prototype, not the implementation.
r/learnpython
Alternatively, using pip-tools, you can just sync against different individual requirements files or combinations of them. 
r/vscode
Because I don't need those features, I also did not create a brand new package to add this feature.
I haven't looked into it, but if the only feature missing is multiple environments, you could just create a package that only switch environments, instead of rewriting the whole thing. You then help pipenv (or an other dependency manager) become more mature and you consolidate the ecosystem. Dependency management is a mess in python and I feel that if all we do is write 15 packages for every possible use-case, we'll just get a python2 vs python3 sort of problem.

If you are using primarily numpy and python functions, try pythran. The extra effort that you might add is a simple type annotation.
Hold up, did you just call *Python* verbose? What world are you living in? Less code to read does not mean more readable. I can obfuscate my code to all hell and it would be "less" with the obfuscator's optimizations, but I wouldn't be able to easily read it at all.
I think it's with the sentiment and hands-on-ness of assignment expressions.
I would argue this does the opposite, the other rolling depends on new standards (Pipfile, pyproject.toml etc). This tries to use existing standards (setuptools).
Shame about that SSL cert.
Yes, but you should never overwrite a file from another package, it only lasts to problems. You create pipm command, you should not overwrite pip.
There comes a point where you would be better off on another language. Python is good because it's readable and "fast enough" for most things. If you need faster, use the right tool for the job. Don't turn python into "unreadable but still kinda slow."
Great course for beginners this one. But one thing that really annoyed me thus far is that you at one point in the course, i think in the lecture regarding try and except tell people that it is really good practice to always comment your code. This is simply not true and I would advise you to read the book "Clean code" to see why it is not good to write comments instead of have having the code be the documentation itself. 
Well, then you will be fine with Pipenv as it is. It looks (I haven't try it yet) like this project's key feature is that it abstracts packaging like Pipenv does except it uses setuptools. It is probably not for me, since I prefer things to be explicit, but maybe it will be useful to others. No other tools did this with setuptools as far as I know.
In this vein, Pyramid's `reify` is a personal favorite. https://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid/en/latest/api/decorator.html It is exactly as fast to access the cached property as it is to access a static attribute, because the cache *is* a static attribute. It's a very simple decorator. If you don't want to import a whole Web framework to have it, I wrote an equivalent one some time back. https://stackoverflow.com/a/35328997/416467
I'm working with python using pycharm for about 5 years already. And I'm absolutely satisfied. Totally worth buying a paid version.
Like Matlab, your biggest speed gain will be by vectorizing your operations using numpy arrays or Pandas DataFrames
Sure, but I don't think that point is "I want to memoize a function call". Memoization is really low hanging fruit in the tree of program optimization. Sometimes I have memoized something by habit as I wrote it, simply because it is so easy to write.
C extension support is getting better, I find you can usually rebuild them for PyPy by running ``pypy setup.py build_ext``and they work just fine. I did have one issue where one of my functions got linked to a function of the same name in a shared library instead of the function I wrote, but I don't think that's PyPy's fault.
&gt;I would second looking at trio. It's design docs were a good read.
attempting a mesh net with cars. cars sending information to each other such as braking and accelerating and other information that could be helpful to other drivers. 
Lmao just use R
kids.cache was my goto [https://pypi.org/project/kids.cache/](https://pypi.org/project/kids.cache/) In a more recent ptoject memoize with a cache size of 1
Yup. It's not from my IDE. I just embed the stock one into my Qt-based gui. I could stick another button to do plot control, but usually I just make the rest of the gui do that part (e.g., I don't want the user having to open a menu to set the plot limits). https://matplotlib.org/users/navigation_toolbar.html
Think of each as one tool in the tool box. 
I'm not sure I've seen a faster one, but at work we use one written in-house that includes attribute setting and deleting (and even a way to do type checking when you set the attribute). Cached properties can actually be quite nice since they allow you to not recalculate certain big properties until you have something that actually changes them.
&gt; The question is: I'm sure I could Google "What Python Module allows me to copy and paste text", but I don't want to do that every single time I want to create a program of some sort. How can I easily search and find the best module to use and also find what is available until you're intimately familiar with python and its ecosystem, googling is the fastest way and is pretty much the industry standard for finding out how to do what you don't want to do. there's no shame in it. with time, you won't need to google as much. but work on simplifying your searches. something like this: "python copy paste" &gt; as well as the purpose, after the "." period. use an IDE or look for a plugin for your editor for autocompletion also, with an full-fledged IDE, you'll be able to navigate directly to a class, method, or function's documentation and declaration directly without having to leave the IDE. that will be specific to your IDE though
As far as finding modules or packages, you could use pip's search function or search PyPI directly from their website. You might also try searching github. In my experience, none of those options is generally all that effective. Googling is likely to bear better fruit. The other thing I've found useful is listening to python podcasts and talks about the ecosystem, you'll often get exposed to new and useful tools that way. A lot of learning what to use and when really comes through experience, exposure, and repetition... and that's something that only comes with time. As far as finding "the best" tool for anything, in a lot of cases you'll find that people tend to gravitate toward things that are more developed and refined. If you search for packages on github, the best tool is usually the one with the most contributors and most stars. But, that's not always the case, because sometimes people just gravitate toward the familiar. The other problem with figuring out the best tool is that many tools are hugely context dependent. There are dozens of graphing libraries, web frameworks, database tools, etc all written for python. Which one you're going to want to use is going to depend a lot on your own personal preferences and what exactly you're doing. As far as knowing what different modules/functions actually do, and how to specify the relevant options, you'll need to consult the documentation for the specific package. Most of the prominent modules have at least passable documentation online somewhere. Whether that's on their website, github, readthedocs, etc can vary. The same is not always true when dealing with less ubiquitous modules. Docs tend to be written in a pretty consistent format and once you get used to reading them it gets easier to figure things out. Unfortunately, the way programming documentation is usually written isn't really accessible to newbies. To be honest, even when there is documentation, it's not always readily apparent how things all work together until you actually try to use something or read a howto and there's really nothing wrong with that.
If you like the flexibility of python but want speed, I'd recommend checking out Julia. Its syntax is probably closer to Matlab (which can be an advantage in converting people). Its development style is quite nice, mostly you can write Python-style dynamic code, but then speed things up by making sure your routines are type-stable. Its type system is also quite nice. Also, version 1 is coming soon so the language is stable. It's really worth checking out, it feels like a very modern language that's learned from the mistakes of Python and is specialized for numerical work.
&gt; What world are you living in? world of Elixir Ruby, modern JS ... I understand that Python syntax is supposed to be simple and approachable to casual users. But for everyday users, some additional syntax sugar to learn would be a no issue and would make their work more efficient.
\`x += 5\` would serve good here
I installed it only for me as recommended... :( 
It would make their work more efficient only in the beginning, until they see how niche the syntactical sugar is, then only making their code worse and worse using the syntactical sugar proposed here as a crutch.
no, not in there either... I checked.. :(
&gt;no, not in there either... I checked.. :(
I understand complains about the ?? operator. But the ?. thing can be useful. The problem is, that it is not compatible with Python best practice of raising exceptions instead of returning None.
The ?. is the same thing as the ?? operator. data?.foo data.foo if data is not None else None
Thanks!
Do you have TIE and DXL deployed? You can create on demand scanning exclusions for exe files.
Thank you for the words. I am coming from the Service Desk world with Powershell experience and have gotten so use to using the "help" option to get more details about what I'm using. Because of this I use ATOM a lot, but recently switched to PyCharm. Never knew of the F1 feature until I read and searched your comment about documentation inside :)
Same here... 
So it is not that useful. I thought that it is like getattr(data, 'foo', None). Still, it is shorter than the None testing or catching exceptions.

Hi, I'm the dev behind Scraper API, I'd love to hear what URLs in particular you were having trouble with. As for the speed, we use a fairly optimized Puppeteer instance, I don't know if it's possible to get faster than what we have rendering with a headless browser.
Would you have advice on how to read the documentation? I looked at pyperclip.copy's documentation and you're right. It's not as straight forward as I was hoping. Pyperclip.copy documentation from PyCharm. Assigned to copy def lazy\_load\_stub\_copy(text) Inferred type: (text: Any) -&gt; Any A stub function for copy(), which will load the real copy() function when called so that the real copy() function is used for later calls. This allows users to import pyperclip without having determine\_clipboard() automatically run, which will automatically select a clipboard mechanism. This could be a problem if it selects, say, the memory-heavy PyQt4 module but the user was just going to immediately call set\_clipboard() to use a different clipboard mechanism. The lazy loading this stub function implements gives the user a chance to call set\_clipboard() to pick another clipboard mechanism. Or, if the user simply calls copy() or paste() without calling set\_clipboard() first, will fall back on whatever clipboard mechanism that determine\_clipboard() automatically chooses. &lt; Python 3.6 (redditQuestion) &gt;
&gt; we can just create a .DLL with C# and load it in Python? Yes you can, if you create a COM object in C# you can use it with the win32com module (in the pywin32 package). I don't know if that's the correct way to go if the COM object is going to be the GUI though. Seems too much trouble for the just the GUI. "There must be a better way". I've always worked the other way around (GUI in python, COM object for business logic or something that is only available in that form).
Yeah but shorter code does not mean easier to read. Which is easier to read, this: result = a ?? b?.c?[d?.e ?? f] Or, if a is not None: result = a else: if b is not None: result = None else: indice = d.e if d is not None else None indice = indice if indice is not None else f result = b.c[indice] if b.c is not None else None Personally while much longer, the latter is far more easier to understand and go through step by step.
&gt; Since the target environment is windows and I don't want people messing around the code to see the server passwords, I converted the application to an executable using pyinstaller You probably already know this but you can still reverse these; a simple description [here](https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/a/164)
Are you building your application with an icon? (-i &lt;&gt;..) If yes, try building it without one. Pyinstaller uses some hacks to add an icon to the exe which doesn't work with some antiviruses. Had a problem with GData^^ . 
These are two extreme cases. You can split the first one into two or three lines. I think that the first one is ok, once you get used to this syntax. 
Not necessarily. Even naive nested for loops in numba can be a lot faster than equivalent vectorized numpy code in my experience. The numba compiler will optimize those loops automatically if you pass the right options to the `@jit` decorator. 
R isn’t as fast
These aren't extreme cases, things similar are shown in the PEP. Not to mention, the people who are new are who we are talking about. They will use this as a crutch and then continue even when it is unmanageable.
how would you imagine using tensorflow? Do you understand how deep learning works? You'd be better off using text to speech and then attempting to match slide text. 
Thank you!
Just released [yampex](http://edsuom.com/yampex.html) 0.8.1, Yet Another MatPlotlib EXtension. It makes Matplotlib easier to use, especially with subplots and annotations. You simply construct a Plotter object with the number of subplot rows and columns you want, and do a context call on it to get a version of the object that’s all set up to do your subplots.
"The coupon code entered has sold out."
It's an alternative and not a very good one. ABCMeta already has the issue that you won't know you screwed up until you try to instantiate the class. Throwing NotImplementedError pushes the issue down even further and try to use that method. Linters like mypy or pyre can also help you out with partially implemented ABCs but not with a method that only throws NotImplementedError. The metaclass argument is a pretty good one. In theory you can multiply inherit the two together as ABCMeta provides for this in its new method (at least in the pure python version, haven't looked at the C source, though all metaclasses *should*) but this could lead to funny business if the other one provides the register method or the two type check helper methods. 
This will never work because it doesn't make sense to manually specify the type in the for loop. In your example, the type of `res` is determined by the return value of `k8s.resources()` and the typing module will infer the type from there. If `k8s.resources()` would return something different than an iterable of `Resource` instances, then your code would fail, no matter what type you specify within the loop. Generally, you will always get whatever the iterable returns, therefore it makes no sense to specify the type within the loop. 
Oh man I really struggled with this but with Symantec. It appears the only reliable way is to get the app signed with a certificate which you have to buy - ugh. Very curious to see how you solve this. Pynsist (produces windows installers) has a great FAQ section on digital signing.
Thanks, much needed for beginners like me. 
If you want to learn python r/learnpython is the sub. As for ML and stocks? Yes. It has been done before by many people. If your thinking you can throw together a simple model and profit, probably not. But it will be a good learning experience and it can be used to supplement if your going to do stock and trading analysis. Google python and stocks there are a number of services that allow you to build models or various projects to build back testers etc.

I'd say Python is probably the best language for ML and that sort of thing. It's not too difficult.
Nice!
Yeah, I don't see the point either. 
Yeah, in that case I think I’ll stick to learning python for it. Thanks for the advice!
Ok, sorry about that. It’s my first time posting here and didn’t realize!
Have you tried turning off and on again?
I would like to volunteer to assist whoever needs work done. Just send me what you need done. 
I looked at your GitLab page. The project sounds neat, but you should include some generated images in your readme. I went to install it but found that it requires Python 3.6 which I don't have on this machine at the moment. Maybe in a little while I will.

Nah. The data is in json and is encrypted and then exchanged over network but you can just go ahead and print the decrypted text by adding a single line of code, allowing you to see everything.
I was kind of thinking about this signing thing. Didn't find any open source way (read free) way to do this, so changed tactics. Will dig in this further. And as a fellow tormented soul, I hear you. Once I figure out something, will let you know.
Interesting. Will check on this. I haven't changed anything related to icon stuff in this built so if the previous version works this should too. But thanks, will remove the icon file and check.
I'd write like this x = 0 if (y := do_op()) is None else y x = 0 or do_op() 
I doubt any of the members of my team would go and decompile the code and then mess around. Usually that person is me in the team. As they say, the village thief is never scared of getting his house robbed. That being said, on a more theoretical note, would code obfuscation or something help here? Maybe Python and this generated exe are not exactly the correct candidates but hey let's try.
I am trying to learn Scrapy and building a web app in Flask that scrapes and displays some data. Every project comes with a few unknowns. For this project i want to find an alternative to the FlaskSockets implementation and i want to be able to run this Flask application behind a proxy. If anyone has suggestions about websocket libraries to use that work well with Flask, and how to host Flask apps behind a proxy, it would greatly appreciated.
Interesting. I just googled for a bit, and these are something like an exchange layer for McAfee. Would it be possible for me to use the python client to run prior to my application and mark it as exclusion through the TIE and DXL?
For humans? Not only is that ripping off reitz but it's so annoying a phrase I won't even look at your repo.
Do you have access to the McAfee ePo console? Think of TIE as a form of local GTI feed. You can mark the python exe that you're attempting to run as trusted. 
Thankyou so much. ☺️
Interesting. Don't have numba experience but with numpy it's just `M * v` or `M.dot(v)`and get 100x throughout and 10x RAM reduction with minimal effort and risk of messing up your logic. No compiler options or unfamiliar syntax.
Start with a project while building it from scratch you will learn a lot of stuff
My interest in subinterpreters is that offers the lightest practical escape from the GIL. Threads/greenlets do not escape the GIL, and processes are heavy and require serialization for data sharing. Yes, it's yet another form of concurrency, but it does have it's niche use-cases that none of the others can cover as well. The design proposed in the PEP is actually pretty reasonable given the constraints involved. You can't simply share an object between interpreters, because then who owns the object? That means you can't just pass a function object into a `run()` function like you can with threading or multiprocessing. Passing code in as a string is generally how any language handles support for subinterpreters (cf. Lua). I'm looking forward to this PEP. I think it will allow me to more seamlessly interleave heavy CPU processing into IO logic at a greater scale than processes would allow.
The filename is already added to the organization level whitelist. But looks like it is not the actual antivirus that is cleaning it, but rather the Adaptive Threat Protection part of it which uses behavioral analysis to identify threats. There is no way as they tell me to add something to it's whitelist.
Yeah that sounds right, that would have been for McAfee application control. You need to add the exception for McAfee Endpoint Security - Adaptive Therat Prevention. I have a feeling that DAC may be blocking the execution. Can you check the agent logs to see ? 
I know there are a couple other JSON comment libraries out there, but they've never really met my needs. I spent a bit of the weekend writing a library that does. Supports C/JS style block comments and single line comments, and retains line number and character column number for JSON syntax debugging. Drops into the `json.load` and `json.loads` methods `cls` argument for the decoder to use. The backend decoder is the default Python JSON library decoder, just tossing this comment parser in front as a preprocessor.
Will check and confirm. I see McAfee Endpoint Security Alert when I run the application and in the back, windows logs shows "Adaptive Threat Protection repaired xyz.exe ...""
It is just a nifty thing. I am too lazy to remove pip from the copied text from any installation instructions. It doesn't affect the original functionality. Maybe I could add a way to opt out of it.

Minor thing, 'whatever' or with the little single quote on the tilde key, `whatever`.
sounds like a problem which can be solved using ID3. If youre not yet aware, the id3 algorithm constructs a tree whose nodes correspond to the different info category in the feature vector. it builds the tree from the root and it does that by computing for the entropy of each infro category. I suggest you read more about the tree construction, it's fairly easy to understand. anyway, heres a python module for that: https://pypi.org/project/decision-tree-id3/

Long story short, old python libraries (and many builtins) are not pythonic. It either inspired by Java syntax, or the current pythonic way didn't exists (or wasn't pythonic) when it was written.
Do you know of any efforts to reform the code? Couldn't they integrate property decorators to maintain the old style while pushing for a newer more pythonic syntax?
Python Book is innocent man!
import ai my_ai = ai.Ai() my_ai.start()
"Reforming the code" risks breaking all existing code that uses matplotlib. One of the problems designing a language or large graphics system is that early decisions, which at the time seem OK, can become a problem later. For example, print statements in python 2. Undoing these questionable early design decisions can be slow and painful, if they are undone at all. To this date, matplotlib developers have seen no need to change. What can happen is that people other the original developers decide to create a newer, better abstraction which may, or may not, replace the original system.
Rock on! Studying Python at the moment. Thanks.

Wow impressive, but how do you manage to cluster them by 'meaning'?
Is it wrong to have set and get methods though?
You can get a score for semantic similarity of two words by finding the dot product of their word2vec representations. So I use spacy's pretrained models to get these representations and Multidimensional Scaling to position these words in a 2D plane from their semantic similarity matrix.

I haven't included support for python 2.7 for faster prototyping and development, maybe I should target it later. And that's a good idea, adding generated ages, I'm so deep in development I didnt even stop to save some images!
Matplotlib's API was mostly modeled after MATLAB's plotting functions, because at the time it was somewhat a standard and lots of people knew it. MATLAB didn't have properties at the time. Now you might want to try more modern libraries, like [plotnine](https://plotnine.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), which is modeled after R's ggplot. So, still technically a bit foreign, but in terms of API, much more descriptive.
It's not 'wrong' per se, but it's not 'pythonic'. 
Thank you!

I guess because these special types of object are kind of self-documented ?
Probably you need a dictionary, maybe one exists but you could create your own quite easily, although it gets annoying with words with many variations like color, colorized, Color, colors, etc.. Maybe there is an intelligent way to deal with it, sorry for the useless post.

The same reason why a lot of PyQT code uses getters and setters, as well as a lot of code old and new, it is either a wrapper around a library in another language or modeled after that. Python is one of the only langauges where not only do getters and setters go against the usual code style, but they actually perform slightly worse than direct access because of the method call overhead.
A translator would be great. 1) Alternative phrasing like "knock on wood" -&gt; "touch wood" 2) Grammatical errors like collective nouns using "is" vs "are". 3) Words that aren't used like "behind the 8 ball" 4) Things that don't exist in the other culture e.g. trainspotting is as mysterious to US speakers as college sports is to UK.
It just keeps going
Not surprisingly, some of these were already in my Pactk library. I really should start catching up with it...

Sentdex tutorials got my started in Python. He’s an excellent teacher. 
Doesn't Australia use its own dialect of English spelling - sort of a hybrid of British and American? If i remember correctly, you use -ize where we (in the UK) use -ise, but spell colour the same way. I still don't think we have official definitions for words like "dag" or "dunnie" though... ;-) I would approach this by diffing the Linux system "words" files for the relevant regions, and create a translation dict between them.
It's python2 and does not folow Pep8 though.
Awesome, thanks for sharing!
are you talking about PointClass? the interface file declares it as 'extern const void \* PointClass'. my assumption is that pointers declared as extern don't even point to NULL. Therefore, PointClass either points to an object of type struct PointClass or it doesn't exist as far as the program is concerned. without a metaclass, an object must be statically initiated according to its class description like so: extern const void * a_class; /* header file */ ----- static const struct class_description _a_class = { sizeof(struct class_description), a_dynamic_link_function, }; const void * a_class = &amp;_a_class;
Okay, unpopular opinion time: This is a dead meme. Going one by one on his points 1. You don't like charging for courses-- fine. That's your prerogative. But *almost everyone* charges for courses in this day and age. The right to an education is free. The right to have someone teach you is not. Take the movie Good Will Hunting for example-- there's a remark in there about someone paying 150k for a college education you can theoretically get for 1.50 in late fees at the library. This is undoubtedly true, except for the fact that the distinction is while both are excersising their right to learn, the first is excerising their right to have assistance on their path to learning. In such a way that the quality of the education is to an extent guaranteed to future employers rather than them having to take a chance on Joe Schmoe who is self taught. They can be just as good, but you are paying for the security, not the education itself. 2. The figures he describes are standard practice, it's not limited to Udemy. These figures can indeed be properly estimated with the right data, regardless of the tiers they have in paying the instructor. The true question is if they have enough data, which as an outsider, he himself can not comment on, only if he tried to put content on Udemy and their estimate was massively over what he actually ended up receiving. The "customer on other courses" is also crap. It's like complaining about someone going to college to be a math major, and then in their free time (ex over winter/summer) decide to take extra courses which they pay for which don't help for their major at all, which some people do. Or people who go take one class in Python and then decide to take another class in Python by a different peofessor at the same university. The university gets their cut regardless, the professors pay are completely separate, just as is here. 3. He keeps going back to the spam part-- this isn't his problem. It isn't Udemy's problem either, you see this kind of referral spam everywhere. Having referrals does not mean you will have referral spam, it means if you let piece of shit bots get on your site you will have referral spam. Which is unavoidable to some extent. You can make the same argument about Lynda-- there was a shit ton of referral and ad spam previously. But they just cracked down on such signups, which isn't so easy to do. 4. Everything's on sale? You mean how at least in the US, companies can do markup prices just to claim it is on sale (50 dollar item gets turned into a 100 dollar item, 50% off) or just saying that having things always be on sale is negative? While I don't agree with the first practice, it is common in the US, and from what I've seen at creators to an extent deciding prices, Udemy does not have complete control over this. 5. It's disgusting that people reupload your content without rights? Definitely. But this isn't Udemy's problem. Just as it isn't Youtube's, just as it isn't Reddit's. Follow the standard procedure of a DMCA request as always, and the company does take action. They don't have legal responsibilities to pre police content, only to police it on request. Such is the plight of any content creator. The biggest comparison I can find here is Youtube Red/Premium/Music Premium. On their own they decided to have a content ID system ages ago because of backlash, but it is still shitty and still doesn't catch anywhere near everything. But if the holder of the license makes the DMCA, they take it down. He can still DMCA the precise title and description regardless of buying / subpoenaing the course. But other than that, he has to follow legal mandates. It is not a problem of Udemy but of the legal system surrounding him. He even mentions Udemy "should have to have the legal obligation". But they *don't*. Don't complain to Udemy, complain to your congressmen. 6. They don't validate "expert" instructors because this isn't something you can validate. It's like complaining being taught by the peer student/student just a year or two higher in college and complaining that you aren't being taught by the professor. It is standard practice in academia and has equivalent parallels here. So again. While the situation sucks, none of it is an issue of Udemy. It is an issue of the encompassing legal, educational, and business environments. It just so happens to be that Udemy is a combination of all three. Complain about the environments, not about this one company. Because until you do, it just brings more and more people to make such companies and engage in these practices you claim are "bad" but are unfortunately standard.
be excited at the fact that you don't know how to build a program. find a problem. try to solve it with python. along the way, casually read / watch some advanced python guides. by casually reading/watching. you don't need to understand anything other than when a specific technique would be useful. eventually, you'll stumble across something and think "oh, i can use this". that's when you worry about the details and actually study the example implementations. Once you build up a mental library of which techniques solve which problems, just google it if you need refreshing. read the python docs. again, don't worry about the details. just know they exist and what their purpose is.
It's awesome! Thanks for sharing!
Constant time oracle: return 42
Can anybody explain why getters and setters are not \*pythonic\*. Who defines this?
VIDLE is a fork of IDLE specifically for use with VPython. Also, not sure which OS you're running, but all the docs for installing VPython require that you install Python 2.7.9 first. So you should already have Python on your system. I would recommend however if you're going to learn to code in Python, install Python 3. You can have both Python 2 and 3 coexisting together on the same system. Do some searches and there's plenty of documentation out there on working with multiple version of Python on your system.
optimize.minimize is just a wrapper method. Some attributes of the return value are optional and depend on the specific method used.

Generally, PEPs which are thoroughly discussed on the development mailing lists, and reviewed by the BDFL and core maintainers. It is important to have well-defined guidelines about what is and isn't pythonic, because the more homogeneous everyone's code looks, the easier it is for everyone to read and use everyone else's code. These guidelines are one of the best things about python development.
Have you checked [argparser](https://docs.python.org/2/howto/argparse.html?highlight=argparser)?
Other way around I'd say. "ize" is probably vaguely more acceptable in the UK (thanks to the Oxford dictionary) but is not generally seen in Australia at all. "colour", "neighbour", etc. are the same in both Australia and the UK, but Australians might be comparatively more inclined to use "analog", "program" and a small number of others.
No. It's not "free". You pay for it with your personal data. And asking aspiring programmers to use a strong password (minumum lenght) to then ask them to *weaken* it by enforcing the use of special character, uppercase, digit (thus reducing the entropy) ... 
No, obfuscation should never be relied on for any form of security. You should really use some other form of authentication/authority control that doesn't require packing credentials into the program.
&gt;... until you have something that actually changes them. Yes, but that way you are buying speed and pay with program complexity. For any non-trivial computation (and only those would be worth caching) calculating the dependencies gets really hard and bug-prone.
First, this is /r/learnpython material. Second, you need to be more specific. Do you mean a command line `--help` style page? In that case, either do it manually and display (followed by `sys.exit()`) or use one of the many CLI parsing libraries, including `argparse` which is standard. Or do you mean a `help(mymodule)` or `help(myfunction)` page? Then you add a *docstring* below the function: def myfun(args): """This is a docstring""" ... 
You'd normally want to use a Java library if you use Java or Kotlin.
I don't have an answer and I really do not mind (too much) a get/set method, but what gets me is the difference between `pyplot` and regular object-oriented interface: plt.xlim([0,100]) ax.set_xlim([0,100]) This is still a get/set method, but the different syntax is annoying. (Which one is more "pythonic", even if the neither are particularly, is a different question. The `set_`, `get_` is explicit, but also bloated compared to the `plt` methods. But neither is particularly pythonic)
I had some fun refactoring and sent you a pull request. Enjoy at your own leisure.
Working on writing a post comparing VSCode and PyCharm. &gt;[PyDevTeam](https://deveopplython.com)
God damn you're a toxic little shit.
pipenv can manage installation of new python versions if you also have pyenv. I use pyenv without pipenv and it's great. I would go the other way and recommend using brew as little as possible for project-specific python dependencies; it's just not how python packaging is designed.
I'm trying to create a data pipeline that pulls title and upvote data from Reddit and puts it in a table in SQL server.
I recommend you to watch https://youtu.be/wf-BqAjZb8M Raymond did good job on explaining _why_ there is a pythonic way
Without any additional configuration? Project specific dependencies means stuff like django or stuff like pipenv and pyenv?
Brotha!!!
Thanks for the link. Looks like they're aiming for a version 3 release :-)
It hurts my special eyes, that's for sure /s
Pyenv isn't written in python, so that lives in your system. Probably fine to use brew for that. I guess pipenv is meant to be installed with your system python.
Really thank you. Thats helps a lot. 👍🏻 
Hello, If you're looking to getting into automation with Python, then I would suggest checking out my YouTube playlist where I specifically cover tools for automation in Python: [LucidProgramming Web Scraping and Automation in Python Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5tcWHG-UPH1fnJw-BvBiiiPUPm1LUKsm) The development environment you will notice in my videos is Linux-based, but everything I do is achievable in Windows. I would recommend looking into Selenium (for web automation) and PyAutoGui (for Desktop automation). I have a series on both of these topics you may find useful. Cheers, hope that's helpful!

I've just completed the Django 2 course on udemy. It's the forth time I've attempted to learn Django and I finally get it! Really good instruction.
Very cool!
No.
The --python option lets you select the Python interpreter you need. https://docs.pipenv.org/#pipenv-usage
What you can do is install python 3.6 alongside 3.7 on your computer, then pipenv will let you choose either one
&gt; It either inspired by Java syntax Or Matlab syntax...?
I hate MATLAB, but I cannot deny that it is still very, very much the standard and millions of people know it and use it.
Hey Kosmiche, Perhaps I misread the post. I can take down my comment if you think it's not relevant. I thought the PyAutoGui content would be helpful, but if the community disagrees, I will happily remove the post if it's not helpful. 
Lightweight Django book is my personal favorite! You can get it for cheap from ebay!
Everybody in my mechanical engineering program learns it. I switched to all python for my junior year and I haven't looked back. 
Yes, but for the sake of a fair comparison, I wanted numpy to also assign the result to a new array.

They are just subclasses of dicts though, aren't they? 
oh ok
For extra information, running `pip install .` outside the env installs it into the system python, this works but doesn't isolate it. Resulting shebang is `#!/usr/local/opt/python/bin/python3.7` 
Erm, we definitely don't use "-ize". I live in the UK, but I'm an old git, so maybe I'm blind to it ;-) Sounds like we're more in harmonly than I thought, then... 
You can use Ansible and have your tasks defined using it.
`example.py`: #!/usr/bin/env python3 from plumbum.cli import Application, SwitchAttr, Flag class Example(Application): '''This is an example application!''' turbo = Flag(['turbo', 't'], help="enable turbo mode") folder = SwitchAttr(['working-dir', 'd'], default="/tmp", help="where we will work") def main(self, thing): '''Make something happen to thing''' print("turbo?", self.turbo) print("working directory?", self.folder) if __name__ == '__main__': Example.run() --- `./example.py -h` --- This is an example application! Usage: example.py [SWITCHES] thing Meta-switches: -h, --help Prints this help message and quits --help-all Print help messages of all subcommands and quit -v, --version Prints the program's version and quits Switches: --turbo, -t enable turbo mode --working-dir, -d VALUE:str where we will work; the default is /tmp
You could just leave it as `pipm` and make an alias in your shell.
True for much of the scientific stack. Dangerous if you try to port things from matlab though, because they're similar and yet not quite.
What's wrong with `pip-tools` and using a different requirements file for each env?
Even if you use something other than Task Scheduler, the chances are good you will still have problems because Task Scheduler is not the source of your unreliability. Task Scheduler is a core part of Windows and is used extensively for core Windows services. Nothing about it is unreliable.

I don't think "extern" means what you describe it to mean. My understanding is that "extern" means simply that the variable is declared elsewhere. In your case this "elsewhere" is the "implementation" file, where it is an uninitialized pointer.

As I am one of the people listed in the Credits section of the book, I tried to find the origin of my credited material. It appears that my contribution may have been part of the now-retired Stack Overflow Documentation project. As that is no longer maintained, I fear that it will become increasingly stale. I still consider the official Python documentation the best reference material for the language and standard packages and modules. 
For questions please go to r/learnpython. IDEs provide a lot of functions over vanilla text editors. A debugger, virtual environment handling, integrated VCS, countless plug-ins.... Those are all features an IDE can have, which a regular text editor does not. The "best" IDE does not exist. It is completely up to you to decide. Some people really like PyCharm, some like Atom, some notepad++ and some VIm.
IIRC PEP 505 was deferred to 4.0 for some reason.
&gt;tfw he spelled it wrong
Wow this is really good
I was actually trying to install it with pip under Python 3.5. I did get Python 3.6 installed (WinPython), but it still wouldn't install with pip. I downloaded it manually and copied the terrainlib package into site-packages and that worked. I was able to get it to run and saw the error that occurs with BITDEPTH\_16. I was able to get it to produce images with bitdepths of FLOAT, 8 and 32. Float and 8 produced the same image that shows some grayscale, but it repeats very frequently so I don't think it's coming out right. The bitdepth 32 image just came out in black and white, no grays at all, which seems even less right. And I also tried to figure out how to display this as a height field but wasn't able to. Can you give me a tip as to how that is done?
&gt;I notice the code didn't past appropriately... Anyone got any ideas for fixing that? It's in the sidebar.
I'd consider vim a text editor, not an IDE.
Whoops, I'll change it.
I suggest starting with a text editor or vim. For more information about vim: http://developpython.com/index.php/2018/07/07/will-vim-ever-rule-the-world/
The credentials are not in the code. They are shared over secure channels between the admin and the client when the user logs on. A couple of cryptographic handshakes later, the client receives the credentials and the access levels.
The package isn't available on pypi yet (I wrote the documentation anticipating for that, but I didn't register the package yet), so the best way is to clone the repository and use `pipenv` for dependencies management. Also, the entire library still being in the early stages of development, I might have broken some stuff along the way - particularly with the image exporter which expects an array with values in 0..1 but I recently modified the Terrain object to accept arbitrarily large values, allowing algorithms to be more easily implemented. So for the time being you will need to normalize the values in the array before passing it into the image exporter. I'm already working on that, so a fix might be out soon. I'm developing the library against 3.6.5, will migrate to 3.7 soon since it's out (low priority). Thanks for taking time for the library!
But... How do you uncomment it?
Folks, that's called striking a nerve. Don't even t ry. I was a tech recruiter for 6 years. Now, a proficient coder and on my way to being a programmer. I am beyond justified in saying that I know (just like you do) I'm exactly right. **Could I have been more tactful here? Absolutely, no question.** But again, I'm just so damn jaded. Never dealt with it in recruitment (because I know your types would never get the jobs). I knew how to spot you and avoid you. Only until I learned how to code did I see how far the self-absorbed, condescending antics go inside the "community."

1) You are right that lots of people on the internet are abrasive and need improvement. 2) This seemed like an innocuous joke about a typo. Save your energy for the people that really need updating.

That would be deceptive and wrong. Though probably smart in today's world of rampant data hoovering. Bottom line is that books aren't worth the time spent gaming the system to acquire them, because they are out of date before they are published.
You will definitely need to know all of that at some point in your future career; it doesn't hurt to learn it all now in the right setting. However, if at any point you feel overwhelmed, I'd stop and go at those topics one at a time. A lot of devops people and developers teach the job as one huge lump because that's how they do the job everyday. The reality is teaching all those subject areas isn't right for everyone; some people, but not everyone. Dip your toe in, see if the course is right for you; if not, slow down the tempo. Your learning journey is not a race and if you try to go fast, you will almost certainly hate yourself in the end or fail (or both). Good luck!!!
Personally i like pycharm it helps you write better code.
Nope. It was not. Thanks for pointing that out!!

You create a new key\\value pair on a dictionary by assigning a value to that key. If the key doesn't exist, it's added and points to that value. If it exists, the current value it points to is overwritten. 
Protocols are already [supported] (https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0544/#implementation) by mypy in combination with the typing_extensions module. I guess typing_extensions should be merged into the Python 3.8 stdlib. Is there anything else you have in mind. 
Try the Schedule() library
 [ dvalues[key] for key in ['USA', 'Asia'] if key in dvalues ] flattened = [item for sublist in list_of_keys for item in sublist] Now `flattened` equals `['NYC','LA','Miami','Taipei','Kuala Lumpar']`

Only reading the first paragraph I can tell you that input() will hold the GIL and cannot be interrupted or preempted by threading. If you need stuff to actually happen on time you need to put that into a separate process. Have a look at multiprocessing and inter process communication. In fact if you have a blocking call for user input, that should be in a process all by itself.
Hmm interesting, so in other words, yes, my input methods are blocking the timer... At least from what I understood. That's what I originally thought. So in other words I should have the timer be in the main() function? Do you think that would be better?
If you're using the mobile website, top of subreddit has link "About this community"

Great :) Don't have any suggestions, but it's good to see something like this, I think lots of devs assume celery is just good for sending emails in their django app.
Is the PDF OCR'd and therefore just an image? If so you'd want to run it through OCR. Good luck with getting quality results if you have a blurry PDF to begin with. I'd think you'd want to replace all commas with escaped commas, then parse the text and insert commas where delimiting characters would be. Major delimiting points in the document would need to be carriage return. Of course it depends on what the content of the PDF is so until we know more about the layout all I can think you'd be able to get from a forum is vague suggestions like the ones I've done above.
I’ve been starting to use flask to do web dev so this is pretty useful. Thanks!

I appreciate the comment. Critique with a tone of respect as a person. I can't argue with you. This was the first time asking a Q on a Python page. Python is ALL about a "community" and helping each other grow, right? Assumed it to be the case, but this post confirmed it. I had slight hope there were some exceptions. Then, the snarky comment. Critical mass had been reached. I'll try to keep it more "pleasant" in the future. But this culture needs to change. I'm not letting anything slide. Once people see pushback, maybe they'll start to do the same. That's what I'm going on. However unlikely, it doesn't matter. Otherwise, karma will take care of it. No doubt - because Karma's practical. It just makes sense: you won't attract many of life's greatest pleasures by tearing others down for no reason except that it gives you a twisted feeling of joy and amusement. Either way, the conversation starts now.

Just going off the Oxford English Dictionary ;)
You're welcome, it's interesting to study and I'm looking forward to getting actual terrain images out of it. Could you tell me how to convert the height field image into a terrain? The searches I'm doing come up with results that seem to involve other software like Houdini. Is there are way to do it all in Python?
+1 Also, minimum setup to get celery working. I went with `huey` for my last project and was surprised by some limitations. I'd like to know the easiest path to migrate from `huey` to `celery` with the least pain.

How do people come up with such projects? I really find it hard to come up with problems i could attempt to solve.
Falcon?
I'd like to know about best practices for dealing with memory leaks in Celery tasks. Obviously it would be best to be able to fix the leaks, but that's not always possible when tasks rely on leaky third-party libraries. I know about `max-tasks-per-child` and `max-memory-per-child`, but using those tends to trigger this bug: https://github.com/celery/celery/issues/3085 Are there any other ways of making sure Celery workers don't keep growing without limit?
Pm me the details and price you're willing to pay
I'm still learning Python, and I have *loved* the official documentation. I always have it up right next to my code as I'm figuring stuff out. I saw this book and thought it would be a good reference file. Similar use, but more basic explanation than the docs may be at times. Sometimes I dive too deep and get lost...
I'm currently building a federated image sharing platform using falcon + vuejs. For now it's easy to get something "complex" working. At the moment I'm working on it but the code is at [https://github.com/anforaProject/anfora](https://github.com/anforaProject/anfora)
You could code the file to wait until past a certain time inside the python file itself? Kinda hacky, but it works reliably
Foolish + hungry 😂😂, anyway, that's awesome 👍
If you use any open source tool, it is possible to decompile the file to get the original source (and add the line of code to get the sensitive info) There are online tools to decompile exes for pyinstaller, py2exe and many more, so tread carefully...

I don't think there is, or at least it wouldn't be simple. Personally I'm using Blender to visualize the end results, but that's because I already know my way around the program. The full Python way would be to use or implement raytracing to render out terrains, but that's obviously a non-goal of the library.
Had a similar problem years ago. The best solution I found then was to convert the PDF file to text (multiple programs can do that)and then work on the text file to create the CSV file.
if x == True? 
Django rest framework hands down. You can have a simple rest api up and running in 20 min 
Format string literal's
I worked on a 2d scara style robot and had a kinematic solver for it. https://github.com/danomagnum/scaraprint I never got it working all the way because I didn't use servos that had high enough accuracy and never upgraded them. More info and pictures: http://danomagnum.com/wiki/SCARA_Printer
The second is a single string while the first is three strings added together. Other than that, I don't know.
How would you tack on a variable to the output? You use `+` to concatenate
But what is the difference when you have to apply it to something? What is the point of using it?
You prob'ly wouldn't add three strings together, but you might add variables together... a = "Spam" b = "Eggs" print a + " and " + b
Something like: a = raw_input("what is your name:") print "hello " + a This would ask a user what his name is then says hello (users name).

I wonder how much what proportion of the weightlifting involved is just printing out that stream of names.

What is happening here? (besides names scrolling past)
Admins are banning half of the users of a subreddit for a meme.
This code makes me feel good that I could actually make something useful with my skills. Love that they named the function "snap()" lol.

Not legacy, due to timing issues / cache errors it is possible for the reddit tdb (thing database, a reddit EAV db model on postgres) to skip an id. It is also possible for multiple subs / accounts to be made with the same name, for the same reason. Major issues with the multiple subs thing in 2016 or so when reddit had more downtime, causing caches to be invalidated, and then the "other" subreddit object was chosen for the name.
