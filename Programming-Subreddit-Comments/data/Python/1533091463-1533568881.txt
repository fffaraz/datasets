Exactly! I was a happy paying PyCharm user but needed to edit a Groovy file for Jenkins integration in a project. My issue with jetbrains got a “wontfix” because I should buy the full ultimate product. Been a happy VSCode user ever since. 
Can this also be used for connecting to a python interpretor running inside a WSL?
For a noob to flask with the link you gave does that mean you didn't use any js for the front end?
👍
I've been using cloud 9 lately, pretty easy to get working especially on AWS.
I don't feel like visiting the page to find out but it seems like the content might be loaded via JavaScript which requests isn't going to handle so you end up with just he text "Loading...".
Never tried, but I don't see why not. I would assume it will work just like any other local interpreter. If you can browse to wherever the python binary is and your system can execute it that should be all you need. Full disclosure: I have approximately 25 seconds of WSL experience that consisted of running a fork bomb, chuckling as Windows crapped itself, rebooting, and moving on with my life. 
Emacs master race, checking in. This is a great deal though. Jetbrains makes great IDEs. 
get them to install python and give them the script?

Hello! I'm a bot! I see someone has already suggested going to r/learnpython, a sub geared towards questions and learning more about python. I highly recommend posting your question there. Please follow the subs rules and guidelines when you do post there, it'll help you get better answers faster. Show /r/learnpython the code you have tried and describe where you are stuck. **[Be sure to format your code for reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/faq#wiki_how_do_i_format_code.3F)** and include which version of python and what OS you are using. *** ^(this bot is written and managed by /u/IAmKindOfCreative) ^(This bot is currently under development and experiencing changes to improve its usefulness)
&gt;but as most users are not familiar with the intricacies of Python, wont be able to use it. So my immediate goal is to create a button on the Excel Ribbon which can then call the scriptA.py and based on the parameters provided by the user, can search through all the recipes in the Recipe sheet and then display the found recipes in a separate sheet. If you already have a python script but want to make a simple GUI for your user, try \[Gooey\]([https://github.com/chriskiehl/Gooey](https://github.com/chriskiehl/Gooey)) or \[Wooey\]([https://github.com/wooey/Wooey](https://github.com/wooey/Wooey)). 
I cannot stand this guy. I can forgive him for seeming brash in his talks. I mean, he's clearly enthusiastic about his work and eager to share. For a non-professional speaker, it can be hard to hit the right tone. It's easy for a nervous public speaker to accidentally give the wrong impression. I can forgive him for his atrocious \`vim\` skills. I mean, seriously, not only does he demean himself with visual mode, but he clearly doesn't even know \`"+vipd\`! Like, seriously? It's just painful watching someone \`"aVjjjjjjjjd\`. I can forgive him for giving mostly garbage talks. There are already plenty of other talks out there that are actually useful. I suppose there's room in the world for silly nonsense. I can even forgive him for the atrocious jokes. He's clearly **funny-looking**; I can give him a break on not being funny otherwise. What I cannot forgive is: at PyData NYC 2012, he was talking to an attendee about \`lambda\` vs \`def\`-style functions, and he intimated that they were *behaviorally* different. Clearly, they *are *formally different, but he suggested that \`lambda\`s don't create closures, which they clearly do. He completely misinterpreted PEP-0277 ([https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0227/](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0227/)) and clearly didn't understand the reason for the default argument capture pattern: for x in range(10): locals()[f'f{x}'] = lambda x=x: x assert f1() == 1 All the rest I can forgive. But this. Never. ^((Be nice, be positive, and pay attention to that code of conduct, folks. And be sure to tip your waiters. I'm here all week.))
Animation? Never woulda thought of that.
It's pretty neat actually. This is a library and the additional typing helps users who also want to use static typing to verify their code. I would say it also has been invaluable to us as a team in general. I don't think you should type your production company code like this, but we have very good reasons for the decisions made here. Have you taken a look at the Kafka Streams source code? I think the ideas presented in that library are incredible, but also very complex and hard to understand. I would be very interested in learning how you would do it in a better way.
"I'd recommend using a framework if you're interested in building serverless applications. " I don't understand this, how can you have serverless applications? If I put something online, don't I need to host the website on a server? Is it possible to have an online application that is serverless(if by serverless you mean host it on my computer, I understand, but otherwise?)
So, here, you already know what the real programming challenge in this task is. Why do you bring garbage like Kafka and Docker into this then? They will never help you solve your problem. Not under any circumstances. Yes, I worked in a company which did live streaming. I can more or less figure out the numbers. Your perception of what will be fast and what will be slow is totally backwards. Your Kafka vs HTTP doesn't make any sense. Why are you even considering streaming video over HTTP? This is like, if you cannot go to Mars to buy a pack of cigarettes, you decide that the right answer is to go to Jupiter. No. Open a UDP socket and copy your video into it. That's all you need. The video is already in a streaming format, with all that data you wanted to save about it already in it.
Most of the DCEs support Python for plug-ins and scripting. Apart of that studios usually build most of their digital content management systems and define pipeline workflows in Python.
Data analytics and visualization specially when you combine numpy and scipy with visualization libraries like matplotlib etc. Throw in some PyQt and PyQtGraph and you've got some pretty nifty apps which support interactive plots. I've build some good looking desktop apps using just numpy and PyQt.
Serverless applications mean you use two things, Functions as a Service and Backend as a Service. I.e. all you actually code in your programming language of choice are functions which you then configure to trigger on certain events. Then you make Amazon or w/e cloud provider manage your resources such as databases. The concept is explained here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serverless_computing You wouldn't host anything on your own computer in most of the cases, although I think you could with Openwhisk.
**Serverless computing** Serverless computing is a cloud-computing execution model in which the cloud provider acts as the server, dynamically managing the allocation of machine resources. Pricing is based on the actual amount of resources consumed by an application, rather than on pre-purchased units of capacity. It is a form of utility computing. Serverless computing still requires servers, hence it is a misnomer. *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Python/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28

Ha ha. I tend to agree with you, although I tried this exact method and it’s also painfully slow, it might be fined if your VM is running on the same local machine but otherwise you’re better off with the SSHFS or NFS.
You could try conda as well
Thanks :)
Thanks. I really appreciate it. I should have thought of some better example to show the changes applicable in each call of function closure. But why you think most of the times it's not needed. Isn't it used lot for Function Factory (instead of class) and Decorator.
Have you tried using HomeBrew to install GDAL?
A good code base is a rare luxury. Rarer still is a comprehensive test suite! 8-)
Right. VS Code even suggests the Python extension when it sees that you have Python installed. It couldn't be more straightforward.
Do you know if other sites like ziprecruiter or monster offer this as well? Very cool
If you feel like downvoting my question, I would appreciate if you could offer an explanation so I could improve for the next time.
It is really disappointing to see people bother downvoting a question without even explaining why. 
I wish forums like Reddit and Stackoverflow could remove the downvote button. There is always the flag/reporting option if the post is violating any rules. At least they could make the votes public so people could see the downvoters. Or downvotes should have been completed with an explanation. 
[removed]
I have been keep posting images generated by my repo at : [https://github.com/neozhaoliang/pywonderland](https://github.com/neozhaoliang/pywonderland) (it's written in python) in this subreddit since two years ago, and here are some new results! Surely the math are getting more and more intricate and the images are also getting more and more appealing. Hope you like these new ones.
Here's my down vote. I'd recommend you chill. Also, in case you're wondering, I haven't messed with SymPy and I cannot help you.
Well looking at your post history you posted a question which was a link to Stack Overflow. The rules in the sidebar very clearly state that if you are asking a question about how to do something in python it belongs on the /r/learnpython subreddit instead. Perhaps that is why you were downvoted.
Thanks for the explanation
Very cool. I'm working on a project similar to the SuperContest that the Westgate hosts every year. You pick x number of games versus the point spread each week. My plan is to implement college games as well as NFL and totals as well as sides.
Looking into the subs [new posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/new/) shows that a lot of people come here for asking questions and unfortunately many get downvoted. There could be a flag/report option for off topic posts and then tell the OP to post on other relevant subs. It is not really that difficult. On the hand isn't the whole purpose of this sub for the pythonists to help each other? if a lot of people ask questions here maybe it could be a good idea to let them ask and others who want to answer. If this is a sub for python news for example it should have been reflected in its name IMHO. 
Here is the description of the subreddit from right at the top and directly underneath the name. &gt; news about the dynamic, interpreted, interactive, object-oriented, extensible programming language Python Here is the first rule, also near the top of the subreddit &gt; 1.belongs in /r/learnpython &gt; If you are about to ask a question about how to do something in python, please check out /r/learnpython. It is a very helpful community that is focused on helping people get answers that they understand. You could also say it's really not that difficult to read these two things and realise that this isn't a place for asking questions and there are other helpfully labelled subreddits and websites for that purpose. 
Again, Thanks for the explanations. There are couple of points: * A lot of people post questions here. Just a brief look at[ the new posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/new/) shows many people don't know they are not supposed to ask questions here. So it is not that obvious for everyone. IMHO it is better to either remove this restriction and let people ask their questions for ... sakes. Or make it more obvious, for example by changing the name to Pythonnews or something like that. * One of the reasons that I'm hesitant to post on [/r/learnpython](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython) is the fact that they have disabled the link posting option. Unfortunately Reddit does not offer a good formating environment for asking questions. for example for my former post I had to include some mathematical equations. On stackoverflow I could at least mention them as pictures. I have no such an option here as far as I know. 
In this case this means rule/constant https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invariant
Very cool. I remember scripting povray a lot of years ago, brings back memories of long renders, like come back a day later renders on a 386
&gt; I'm already talking to management to get some sort of proxy exception sorted, but at best it will take some time, or at worst be rejected When I was young naive I would have done a WTF here. Now I just sigh. I don't know if I broke inisde, or if businesses have got stupider.
I endorse Visual studio code as well Add the following extensions to make it an IDE for python - ms-python.python - njpwerner.autodocstring Also I recommend trying to work with *pipenv* and *git* as soon as possible, bot these are not required for learning python itself.
Apples and oranges. JSON handles nested data structures, and where objects have different fields. Also json have a pretty solid definition (well except date/time encoding), while csv is .. at best a loosely defined concept. Character encoding? Tab, comma, semicolon, space between entries? Quotation chars? And then we got things like Excel reading csv differently depending on which locale the machine is set to, and so on. CSV can be messy, and requires a very specific data structure.
That might be something! I didn't have a chance to look in depth yet, but I Googled anaconda repository, etc. before leaving work and could openly access a massive list of packages being served via http. All the packages I wanted like sqlalchemy and paramiko were there. If I can reach these from my dev server, then this is problem solved.
Thank you for your suggestion. Good to know about Artifactory, whether or not anyone will approve it is another thing :)
Less visible is James' tireless contribution to our open source world. He's the VP of NumFOCUS, the non profit which underpins many of our open source data science tools. He's one of the reasons we have the 110 international PyData meetups and conferences. James is one of the reasons that our PyDataLondon has grown to 7,500 members and 5 conferences (which alone have raised several hundred thousand for NumFOCUS). I'm one of the founders of PyDataLondon. It isn't unusual to see James fly from the US to a European PyData conference, setting up the NumFOCUS stand the morning he's flown in, engaging with new community members, speaking (as noted here) and then flying back to the US, and doing this as a volunteer. He puts in a phenomenal number of hours on our behalf to enrich our open source ecosystem, that's where he really deserves acknowledgement.
Sounds like it could be useful. Are you going to make it open? I'd be interested in using it and contributing if you're going to make it available. I've been meaning to do something similar for a while.
Nothing is ever truly finished. There'll always be stuff to improve.
He teaches some of Dave Beasley's rather excellent courses, you might want to reach out to him if you want him to visit your organisation. You'll be hard pressed to find someone with a deeper knowledge of python who is clear, articulate and so enthusiastic (well, alongside Dave Beasley!)
He tends to shy away from acknowledging these contributions in place of highlighting the contributions of others. 
This is pretty neat. I hadn't thought of driving povray with python. How long do the renders take? Would running it multiple times to produce enough frames for an animation be feasible?
Bulshitter par excellence
This is a follow-up of [my first Python typing blogpost](https://blog.daftcode.pl/first-steps-with-python-type-system-30e4296722af). I hope it's useful. All feedback is welcome :)
This looks amazing!
For god sake, read the panel before posting. This belong to the learnpython subreddit. This is written in plain sight. Show respect, read the rules before posting. 
I have done something similar myself, if you have a wifi enabled microcontroller (e.g. esp8266) you can use it to post data straight to a server and then into a sql database rather than going the CSV route. I use flask for this, which can also create a UI so it would all be wrapped up in one python project. Obviously this might not work for you but something to consider if you want to forgo the export of data and just go straight from database to display!
Keep up the good work. It will benefit people down the road. It's also a great way to learn a set of good habits
Thanks for the comment. some points: * I just posted it on r/learnpython [see here](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/93nsum/how_to_generate_a_symbolic_multivariate/) * I did not know this sub is not for asking questions and looking into the [new posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/new/) shows I'm not alone. It would be a good idea to either let people ask their questions here or reflect it in the name, for example changing it to pythonnews * Downvoting without explaining doesn't help. for example I just learned that asking questions is against the rules. If somebody had told me this before it would save a lot of effort * flagging posts as off topic could also work * Modes could add flairs to separate questions from news * r/learnpython has unfortunately blocked link posting and as you you can see from my post it is very difficult to explain it without the mathematical equations. 
Aint that the truth!
I would also like to remind some of the [reddiquett points](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette): * Consider posting constructive criticism / an explanation when you downvote something, and do so carefully and tactfully. * Downvote an otherwise acceptable post because you don't personally like it? Think before you downvote and take a moment to ensure you're downvoting someone because they are not contributing to the community dialogue or discussion. If you simply take a moment to stop, think and examine your reasons for downvoting, rather than doing so out of an emotional reaction, you will ensure that your downvotes are given for good reasons.
For the didn't now, this is written as plain in the left panel. The fact that other does not read that is an issue, not an excuse. For the other points, some are fair and / or have been discuted previously. A beta bot try to spot these posts and warn Théry belong to learnpython. Tbh, some "ask" question met more or less generosity, and your following comment may have making it worse. For your specific question, I will try to answer in the day : sympy is a huge but not alway friendly library, it's not astonishing that you meet some difficulty. 
OK, you have a Python process (not a daemon), it already has stderr and stdout, that is already a reason to do parallel I/O. You opened a file? That's one more input or output. You created a socket? That's one more input or output. There are only so many useful programs one can think about where you don't do I/O from multiple sources.
Invariant is not just any rule... yes, it's more like a constant. Sorry, it just downed on me, English probably isn't your first language. I really don't like when people use buzzwords out of context, but in your case it may be a genuine confusion, so, nevermind me.
* not reading the rules is not justified and I'm sorry if I have violated any of them. However if there is a rule that many people do not follow, maybe it is the time for the rule to be revised and thought if it helps anyone or not. many people post questions here anyway, and this is an opportunity for this sub to grow its audience. ppl could keep downvoting them causing trouble for themselves and OP, or just help them. After all IMHO the final goal is the python community helping each other. * The bot could be really helpful. flairs can also solve the problem mostly. * thanks for the offer, looking forwards to hearing back.
Use of `cast` should really be mentioned in the same breath as `Any` and `# type: ignore` as escape hatches that potentially mask bugs. In the example: user_id = cast(int, get_user_id()) process_user_id(user_id) # no mypy error Because `process_user_id` believes its argument to be an `int`, it can cause problems when `get_user_id()` returns `None`. Also, if you want to write dataclasses but really don't want to type them, you can still do: @dataclass class MyStuff: spam: Any ham: Any
If you can, NFS should be noticeably faster, since it doesn't need to encrypt / decrypt the traffic. But then, neither compresses the traffic... And they must use Git through a graphical shell of their editor?.. Maybe you could write a script that would basically translate any command the editor sends to Git into something like `ssh aws-vm git $@`, and let the GUI editor think that that's the real Git?
*Game Genie Reboot developer*
Range is almost equivalent to the old xrange which you should have been using pretty much always even in Python 2. So the old xrange was basically just renamed to range. 
Right, `cast` is kinda in the same vain as `Any` or `# type: ignore`, I will mention it. As for dataclasses: "untyped" ones (i.e. typed with `Any`) look just ugly, at least for me. Thanks for your feedback!
Lies.
I have used POV-Ray quite a bit in my python dealings using the [vapory](https://github.com/Zulko/vapory) library by /u/laMarm0tte. I will check this library out, it looks great!
POV-Ray still has the advantage that it's free, open sourced, light-weighted and can be easily installed via apt. And it has a vivid group of users and rich resources. For most average people who want to quickly raytrace nice images but don't want to spend much time on learning professional raytracing knowledge, povray is a good choice.
This defenitely belongs to r/gonwild (SFW).
The rendering time depends on two things: (suppose render a 600x600 image) 1. The complexity of the scene. Rendering 3D polyhedra is quite fast and can be done usually in 2\~3 seconds. For 4D polytopes like omnitruncated 120-cell, cantitruncated 600-cell (these are monsters!) which have too many edges and faces, the rendering time is much longer. Especillay if one want to render the soap bubble effects of the faces, the computations are very expensive (the iridence, reflection, refraction are all considered). So usually I choose only a small subset of the faces in the rendering process. 2. the image quality you. For real artwork images you need to use a higher supersampling and a higher antialiasing level, this will also increase the amout of work. you can have a look at the two movies at the website for the repo: [http://pywonderland.com/polytopes/](http://pywonderland.com/polytopes/) For the recreation of the dimensions movie, it contains about 900 frames and are done in one night: I began runnning the script when I was about to leave office and it was done the next morning I got to work. It indeed took 6 hours. 
In your place, I'd just switch to Anaconda. When it comes to binary extensions for Python, `conda` is a much better tool than `pip` / `setuptools` / `distutils`. Also, if you are on Mac, it seems kind of strange to look for GCC. I thought that CLang was the default C compiler on Mac. I never compiled Python modules on Mac, but, again, my experience with Anaconda suggests that they probably would know how to handle that. `pip` and friends are too simplistic for that.
I was also considering using vapory when I started this project. But I found that there are still many features of povray that cannot be done in vapory, and it's very hard to debug the output file by vapory. So I had to do it another way: compute the data in python, export them to povray, and do final computations in povray.
I've also searched for some knowledge on this issue, so far I found this: https://github.com/celery/celery/issues/3061 It says that the common rule of thumb is Prefork pool for CPU-bound tasks, eventlet/gevent for I/O-bound tasks.
Great suggestion, I've just added to the list. Thanks a lot!
Not really sure that analogy makes sense. The best part about an IDE is the “integrated” part, it’s all there out of the box. Sure, you can add bits to VSCode to make it more IDE-like, but it’s not the same experience IMO. I’ve found that VSCode (or any editor) tends to get pretty slow with the amount of plug-ins to get close to an IDE, which is not the reason I install an editor. VSCode doesn’t have support for remote interpreters, Cython, or Vagrant, all of which I need for my job. Jetbrains indexing and refactoring support are also miles ahead of anything any editor or editor plug-in has to offer, the same goes for database integration. Both an editor and an IDE fit into my workflow and it’s always good to have both. For many people an editor with plug-ins gets by just fine, but I haven’t had the same experience. That’s just my 2c.

I think your biggest problem is that you take downvotes so seriously. 
Doesn't handle escaped commas in the columns. Got a better idea?
Ok ... is there a fix? The link leads to a kinda similar bug described for Python 2.7 in 2012 ... and the latest posts seem to indicate it is still not fixed. However, I'm using Python 3.6 ... are you saying it has the exact same bug? And this bug also occcurs in the ipdb? Any ideas how to work around it?
Thank you Yeah I agree with you on the print vs logging statements, and would add that while writing something new I put print statements in everything as a sanity check that way I know how data moves through a function. Once I've made sure what I think the function does matches the way the function performs, then I get rid of the print statements. Now that I'm getting use to logging, that's also when I'd start moving a subsection of the print statements into a log. I'll look into pathlib, though I'll admit my sin is that I still use 2.7. I am planning on migrating soon, it's just an endeavor and I really wanted to improve a lot of bad habits before I made the switch. 
u/pythonHelperBot is happily running on the raspberry pi. It runs on startup, blinks an LED in a heartbeat thread, and listens to a button for restart and shutdown presses. I'll probably always be adding features, but running the basic program on the pi is a milestone. This week I'm letting it run while I work on designing a local stack overflow database so the bot can search the site, and suggest which pages a user should look at if it thinks the python question is similar enough to the SO post. Basically it'll google the problem for them, but to avoid excessive requests on the SO site, it'll run through the local database. I could use SQL for this, but I'm not confident the overhead of the bot and the SQL database would play nicely with the pi, so I think it'll be a custom database design. But first I just need to parse through the database. 
Aw, you need a real parser? Use python. :)
Sadly VS Code's "IntelliSense" is terrible for Python :( 
True but I hope it will improve real soon
 **list1 = list1 + list2** \* Add 2 list; Clear list1s memory(current data), then assign the added list to list1, clear the temporary memory created to store the joined list. **"foo = list1 + list2"** \* Add 2 list, assign it to foo(so foo references to the joined new list), Done! You can see, more action needs to be taken to perform the first one. Python will create it's own list for first, becuase you are using the list to add and you want the result on one of the list you are adding. However on the second one, it's just need to add 2 list and foo variable references the added list. 
Yes, login to a gmail account first with the selenium web browser ;) Sorry for the late answer, never used that account again for a while.
So what's the difference between a bad IDE where they didn't integrate the components well (whatever that means) and an editor with plugins?
I ran it on a 386DX40, ah the memories of running overnight renders only to realize you set a light up wrong or changed it and forgot to change it back. 
What do you mean by "a pandas install"? From PyPI? A distribution package?
What do you mean by "a pandas install"? From PyPI? A distribution package?
When I say round robin, I mean that I want some of the tasks that were enqueued later to also start running soon. Let me give you an example to better explain my usecase: I have many tasks let's say task-1, task-2, so on. Each of these tasks creates subtasks lets call them subtask1-1, subtask1-2, .. subtask2-1, subtask2-2, so on. When I enqueue task-1 first and task-2 later, I want the subtasks from task-1 and subtasks from task-2 to be interleaved (from the point when task-2 was enqueued). Basically, I don't want the subtasks from task-2 to wait until all the subtasks from task-1 is completed. So for this scenario what I did was, I created separate queues for each of these tasks hoping that the workers would be pick the subtasks from these queues in a round robin fashion. 
I thought the same thing at first, too. But in the example given, foo also contains prior data, so this doesn't quite explain what's going on.
I'll have to ask the IT provisioning team. If I were to guess, it'll just be a pip install pandas run as admin, but you're right, it could be anything, worth looking into
If they’re actually dependent, then there are ways to provide that locking mechanism, but your tasks are no longer idempotent, so you may want to rethink your architecture. 
I set `foo` in my example to exactly what list1 is, so it should be roughly identical in what it needs to do with the clearing up references etc. I didn't make this clear, but I was thinking along the same lines re: garbage collection. I also tried `oldg = og; og = og+other` to avoid any cleaning and dereferencing but this didn't change the timeit time. Even if your explanation was right, this doesn't make sense that a DECREF will result in such a huge 100x slowdown. I was under the impression this is a very cheap op.
I don’t think they are that advanced. If I were to teach Python I would introduce f-strings while introducing strings in general.
you should use the animtion feature of POV-Ray, to avoid loading the tokens into memory repeatly. and choose a proper supersampling and antialiasing threshold. in my experience for supersampling level = 3 or 4 is good enough, higher level does not improve the quality much.
I just started to read your article and it seems really interesting ! I will finished it this week :)
Thanks for reading :) Looking forward to working together
This is a timing artifact. The `timeit` module runs the setup code to initialize the lists only runs once, but the timed code is run repeatedly. When you do `scratchList = list1 + list2`, each iteration takes the same amount of time, so the whole operation is linear in the number of iterations. When you do `list1 = list1 + list2`, the `list1` list keeps on growing on each iteration, taking more time to copy on the later concatenations since there are more references that need to be copied to the new list. Its running time is quadratic in the number of iterations.
[Python lists are variable-length arrays](https://docs.python.org/2/faq/design.html#how-are-lists-implemented-in-cpython)
And supports Sphinx 1.7! Only took six months for them to fix that one...
I wrote a scene editor for POVray all those years ago... http://mse.sourceforge.net/ Maybe I should revisit it with Python.
Seems like this is for beginner programmers. Pretty early on, I'd say, since it's a fairly simple concept. I figure, as beginners, they're gonna be spending quite some time printing stuff to the console, so why not ease the hassles a bit with f-strings. I donno if you even need to mention the older string-format options except maybe as a footnote of language-history-trivia.
I started in tkinter as well, and it was so helpful when i learned to work with grids and functioning buttons. It really helped with my need to work with web dashboards. So I think this is really helpful. I enjoy this series!
If you pretend to know that stuff but don’t, actually, then it may come off worse to a prospective employer. Use the job itself to learn how to scale a service. Start with a smaller startup and deal with things as they add users. To some degree, you’re mistaking the means for the end. As an employer, I’m not looking for if you have experience with gcp or aws, I’m looking for battle scars of having stretched a service to its limits, and knowing what kind of issues to expect. It doesn’t matter if you’ve spun up a couple of Linux servers in your personal account unless you know how they perform under production load. 
Enjoy!
Wheres the issue?
It depends on how complex the data structure is, but since you want data coming back from the client to be immutable, I often use a namedtuple to do this. 
In some ways the last few suggestions run contrary to [Jack Diederich's 2012 talk Stop Writing Classes](https://youtu.be/o9pEzgHorH0). Neither argument seems _wrong_.
I never said they weren't? What I mean is that in python, by default instead of actual arrays, we have lists. These lists, implemented in C internally, are implemented as a linked list data structure: https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~adamchik/15-121/lectures/Linked%20Lists/linked%20lists.html
Interesting. Which suggestions do you mean?
They are not linked lists. CPython lists are allocated as a contiguous block of memory at the end of the standard object header, and accessed by directly indexing that memory. Look at the link that the person you replied to posted.
Or you actually mean `Any`. Sometimes this is actually the correct type for something.

How did you make the model that you rendered?
Sphinx changed the path for building from Python, and the PyCharm helper tool couldn’t find it, so you couldn’t run builds from within PyCharm without fixing it for every release.

Well of course, I'd say it will *definitely* some off worse if you pretend to know something you actually don't! That's not the intention at all. I feel like a lot of people are in a catch 22 situation where they can't get the job without the experience but they can't get the experience without the job. So if you're in that position, how does one demonstrate that they can build a scalable web application in a production environment if they don't have a production environment and a large application to work on? That's kinda what the discussion is about. As you said, the best way to learn this stuff is to have a production level app that you push to its limits and try to knock it over, and maybe even succeed at doing so, so you then have to scale it to resolve that issue. The problem is, a lot of companies don't want to hire devs that haven't already done this *for another company*, so I think it's beneficial to demonstrate that you could handle such a situation even if you haven't done it *at* an actual job, since, well...you've got to start somewhere right? I guess that's why I was wondering if there are good ways to demonstrate theoretical and somewhat practical understanding strongly enough that you could get hired for a job with those types of requirements.
Hi, I'm the author of the blog post. Glad you liked it. There's a similar article slated for next Wednesday, about the new pytest-bdd support. You're right, still some loose ends to work on. When you look at the primary ticket, it's surprising how many tentacles such a change gets into. It's a reminder how many things something like an IDE does for a developer.
What has he ever done for us?! I mean ok, nwise is really useful but I ask you - other than that, what has he ever done for US! Ok, yes he works for NumFOCUS and helps growing the community but other than nwise and NumFOCUS, what has he done really? Sure, explaining generators and itertools to lay audiences was useful but other than nwise, NumFOCUS, the PyData community, the NYC python meetup and his talks on generators and other iterables, his funny but useless talks on readwatches, turducken python (python 1 within python 2 within python 3) and his talk on business reporting, I ASK YOU - WHAT HAS HE DONE FOR US?!
&gt; Adding l1=list1 in the setup and rerunning the code Does `del` work?
If I understand correctly what you and OP say, "list1 += list2" and "list1.extend(list2)" are both able to optimize away the creation of a new list because they just modify list1 in place. These should always be preferred to "list1 = list1 + list2", as that can result in quadratic behavior in some cases where "list1 += list2" would not.
I agree. Povray accompanied my work since ‘92 and I am so glad that there’s the maintainer group making sure it’s available for us. A big thanks!
Try posting over in r/PythonHelp Include some code that illustrates your problem and a screenshot of your program's output.
Yes, I use it in all my projects for a couple of months. Code quality greatly improved. A lot of errors are caught early.
For whatever reason, Ublock murders this site. That said, thank you for the knowledge.
&gt; I can forgive him for his atrocious `vim` skills. I mean, seriously, not only does he demean himself with visual mode, but he clearly doesn't even know `"+vipd`! Like, seriously? It's just painful watching someone `"aVjjjjjjjjd`. Those vim skills were critical in stopping an alien invasion, tho 90% of that was down to Will Smith's natural ability as a pilot. 
Adblock too
I really wish they'd break off their csv reader into separate package as pandas is kind of a beast. Pandas is using numpy under the hood, so that's the format that I really want the data in. Thankfully, I don't use CSV files that often, so usually I just go with loadtxt, which is slow, but it's less confusing than genfromtxt.
Nice article. Quick note...in the first code sample on the page it says mypy gives an error about \`process\_pk\`...I think you meant \` process\_user\_id\`.
Thanks :) Fixed!
I am in the same boat as you are. I have been using it for the last couple of months. I am surprised by some API decisions too. I remember during the first week I spent at least several hours playing with different commands to understand what exactly they do, because docs are not clear. Because of the weird API and some other reasons, last week I gave up on the tool. I am currently evaluating pip-tools and poetry.
Have you published the source code anywhere?
Glad I'm not the only one. Poetry is next on my list if I don't get sufficient solutions to my current pipenv problems. pip-tools solves all the problems but has a few too many moving parts IMO
I am working on my new pet project called https://smarturl.me , an url shortener application... I urge everyone to try this and let me know the feedback...

My observations,... Celery will process tasks from multiple queues in a round robin fashion. However, there are lots of details that will change the exact behavior and what you may observe: number of workers, worker concurrency, prefetch multiplier, prefork pool, late acknowlegement... A celery node will have one consumer instance that is consuming from each queue and keeping a stack of tasks. It'll manage serving out tasks to worker processes and consuming new tasks. It's coordinating and aggregating? The consumer will consume from each queue using FIFO. The consumer task stack will also operate using FIFO as it hands them to worker processes. The very simplified behavior should be what you want (items in bold are processing while the whole list represents the consumer stack of messages from many queues): **A**, **A**, B, B, C, C **A**, **B**, B, C, C, A **B**, **B**, C, C, A, A ... One of the many assumptions this oversimplification makes is that each task takes the same time to process. If one of the A tasks took a lot longer than all the other tasks something like this should happen: **A**, **A**, B, B, C, C **A**, **B**, B, C, C, A **A**, **B**, C, C, A, B **A, C, C, A, B, B** ... Queues can be used to your advantage to achieve desired behavior such as interleaving, priorities, context of state,... But ultimately, solve *your* problem but keep it simple.
This is wrong. Run the disassembly to see that they do the same thing.
Yes, they should have been called vector for consistency with other languages, but that ship has sailed.
To be fair I would likely be learning along with you rather than teaching. I hope you find somebody! 
This is so awesome! My life just got that little bit easier!
I invite you and /u/dmfigol to check out my pip-tools [zsh convenience functions](https://github.com/AndydeCleyre/dotfiles/blob/master/.python.zshrc).

Personally, I don't think f-strings should be introduced as a topic of itself. I think they should be more of an addition or enhancement to when you introduce string formatting. After you've introduced string concatenation, format language (using %), and then str.format(), you can then introduce f-strings as another way of formatting strings. If your students can understand str.format(), I'm sure f-strings will be very easy to explain. It's kind of the approach of "Hey, now that you know all these ways of formatting strings, there's actually 1 more new feature in Python 3.6 that makes it even easier/convenient/cleaner/etc"
I'm sorry if I wasn't clear: I agree with your point. I was making a new, additional point that might be relevant to someone other than the OP, namely that x += y and x = x + y do the same thing but the former can be vastly faster.
/r/learnpython is a better option for this question.
Cool article, thanks
Incredibly well timed. Posted 1 hour after I got a rush assignment to do some socket stuff in Python.
Have you tried Plone? https://plone.com/ https://docs.plone.org/
Cool image too! 
Ha. The Python gods are favoring you today. May the rest of your week be so blessed. 😋
Keep trying. ;)
"Don't" To be clear, python is a great language. Which I like very much. BUT, it is too easy to do wrong thing on python, that only experts should use it.
What are you interested in? Start there. Make a project you would actually use yourself. Solve a problem of your own. 
A better place for this would be /r/selfhosted though you will get non-python answers too. [Bookstack](https://www.bookstackapp.com/) may fit the bill, though I have never used it myself. Just FYI, building your own (you said "need to **build** a site", emphasis added, so I am assuming you're doing some of your own coding) is a double-edged sword in terms of security. On the one hand, you are *much* less of a target since the payoff is much lower. On the other, you are likely not a security expert. There are almost certainly vulnerabilities you won't be able to account for. Personally, I built my own but it is a risk. Finally, have you considered something like Squarespace? Obviously the other end of the spectrum, but nice and easy! (I have no affiliation other than helping my dad who uses it)
How are you expecting it to refresh? Are you trying to show new values for things that were already written? Or are you not seeing output until the program exits? Are you expecting to see the above strings on the receiving computer? Also see /r/learnpython for beginner issues with Python.
The idea of doing something just for the sake of consistency with other languages sailed away when Python decided to use whitespace to denote blocks instead of curly braces. I think `list` is a better name for what it does.
That's going to be quite a jump from what sounds like web scraping and form filling to a fully-functional email client with a UI. Good luck and keep us updated!
I’m currently watching Kevin Markhan introduction to Pandas video. It might help you to work your data. It was recorded at Pyconf 2018 in Cleveland. The pace is perfect for people like me, that had zero experience with the library. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hsKLYfyQZc&amp;t=
I’m not quite white what you’re looking for.. Do you want a framework or a CMS? It seems to me like you’re looking for a CMS. Then using Python shouldn’t be your priority and rather if the CMS suits you’re needs. If you really want to *build* this yourself (it doesn’t seem that trivial with all the features you’re mentioning) Django is the way to go.
I recommend checking out [lektor](https://www.getlektor.com). It has a CMS and is very simple to use, if it's just yoy and your wife. It allows pictures etc. but no login, forms etc, as it's a static site generator behind the hoods.
It's done in python. Just compute the coordinates of the vertices, the links of edges and group of faces. For each uniform polytope it has a Coxeter diagram which completely characterizes its symmetry: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform\_polytope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_polytope) given its coxeter diagram, one cna write down a presentation of its symmetry group, and then compute tha multiplication table of this group using Todd-Coxeter algorithm. Then use this group to transform any inittial vertex to get all the vertices. This approach is motivated by [http://jenn3d.org/](http://jenn3d.org/)
One I just noticed using it today is that it doesn't always understand when you override fixtures. Ctrl-clicking a fixture would take me to a fixture of that name, but not the one that would be used by pytest. 
Good job! When I started this project I took quite some time looking for a POV editor under linux, and a python wrapper of it. Finally I used the pov-mode in emacs, and for python wrapper I did not find any satisfied one. There are many features in povray that are very sticky to be implemented in python. For example, color\_map, mesh\_2, smooth\_triangles, sphere\_sweep, ...
Building a Google Cloud Function (Python 3) that will automatically provision Linux servers to download, convert, and re-upload files stored in Google Cloud Storage. Sort of an automated, parallel, large (10s GBs) file conversion tool. The Function is triggered by a Google Cloud Pub/Sub topic that is tied to Cloud Storage. The end goal is that a user can upload a bunch of large files to a Cloud Storage folder and those files will automagically be converted in parallel to a different format depending on which upload folder is used. Love playing with this stuff!
I know its a big jump, but i don't have any other projects or wants in the mean time. So I'm gonna jump in and hope I don't drown
I am using an API and Tkinter for making a companion app for playing Pokemon games. It is a map that when you click on a route, it will update a table using info from [pokeAPI.co](https://pokeAPI.co) so you can have an easier time building the perfect team! I am getting stuck on a few areas, mainly getting scrollbars to work properly for the table, and understanding how to properly parse data and store it in variables. What is the best way to approach super long, structured forms of variables, such as lists of dictionaries of lists? Do I seriously have to just reference it like: `data = [{'tree'=[fruit, {seed, 1}]` `data[0]['Key1'][3]['Key2]` Because that just seems obnoxious. If anyone has an article or tips about how to deal with either of these things, I am all ears!
In fairness, a lot of people take that talk to mean "don't ever write classes at all". When it's brought up I tend to take it with a grain of salt.
&gt; If I understand correctly what you and OP say, "list1 += list2" and "list1.extend(list2)" are both able to optimize away the creation of a new list because they just modify list1 in place. Not necessarily optimize away, but they'd do at most 1 new allocation of a new list rather than X new allocations (depending on how big the two lists are, their actual contents vs their current allocations, etc).
There’s nothing wrong with format(), what I really dislike is the %s method of formatting strings. Should have worded it better. (Still, f-strings beat str.format imo)
in this case, given a group G and its presentation like &lt;a, b | a^2 = b^3 = (ab)^3 = 1&gt;, one can compute all elements in G as words in a, b. e.g. abab, abba, ... if a is a reflection transformation with matrix A, b is a refleciton with matrix B, the abab has matrix ABAB. So for any initial vertex v, we transform v by each element in the symmetric group G: v, av, bv, abv, ... These are all vertices of the polytope.
The tasks could still be independent but for qos/sla reasons it would be desirable for some queues to be serviced with greater priority. I believe that behavior depends on which particular queue/celeryd implementations you are using. I can absolutely imagine amqp/rabbit/db/lol implementations all having different semantics here. You need to drill down to the doc (and maybe source code) on whatever class implementation you're using to know it's behavioral assumptions, as I'm pretty sure the celery API does not specify. Naively, of you need guaranteed capacity for a certain queue you want dedicated workers, maybe with a auto spawning option if the depth of that priority queue is beyond a threshold, but I don't think there's an api (yet?) to design workers with priority consumption.
That’s good. Pytest fixtures are convoluted and overly implicit so you need an IDE to help you understand what the hell is going on. 
Foliun. Interactive easy to use maps with heat maps and point locations. 
Really nice. I consider myself to be an advanced Python programmer and still learned a lot from this. Thank you! 
Ah, I was looking for *foliun*.
Can you elaborate? Conda is great for the scientific / math community from what I understand, but I don't see the relevance in comparison to pipenv/poetry/some other dependency management tool
When was this written? Just curious because of the distinctive Py2 things.
CRUD on a table is basically every webapp without queues or streaming bits. Consider Django. 
You could start with some of the functionality of an email client. A text editor is a nice early project and you can work out a UI as well.
I don't know as I didn't write it, just stumbled upon it and I think I finally get descriptors now after doing Python for about fifteen years now, so I thought I'd share it since the concepts still apply even in Python 3.
There's literally nothing stopping you from linking to a SO post within the message while giving the reader context for an off-site link. It sounds like you are just whining about downvotes because you couldn't be bothered to read the sub rules.
Thanks - how is the learning curve for something like this in Django? (I have never used it). Is Flask a suitable, quicker alternative here?
I love how I think I'm good with Python, and someone comes in here with something that beats the entirety of my github page combined.
Yeah, they'd probably rely on something like `inotify`... and that wouldn't be available for NFS. It is actually OK for the NFS client to be out of sync with the server, if nothing is actively using it (i.e. it doesn't poll the server for changes independently).
Woot! I was getting used to the shadows name of outer scope errors but no more!
No they won't. You can point pycharm to the virtual env or Python path the index them in settings.
Perfect, thanks!
Nope
I literally just started learning sockets around two days ago, thank you!
Why not? 
Do you have any other recommendations on how to learn python from scratch 
Java, at least, calls its equivalently-implemented datastructure an ArrayList, following the naming convention that both ArrayList and LinkedList implement the List interface.
Are you guys purely app based or do you do hardware? I’m an EE who has been working at a HDD/SSD manufacturer for 5 years. I have experience as a hardware test engineer and write testing tools and all that with Python. I’ve primarily worked on hardware but I spend a lot of free time on Python.
I too came across this only yesterday but felt like it made references to Py2. Not sure if it is valid for Py3 as well. 
That's interesting, but that sounds like a fairly superficial similarity. Linked list is a different interface. They support constant time insertion and removal. Vectors are amortized constant time appending. C++'s STL rightly keeps them separate.
I wrote this! Sometime around 2013 :). I don’t think it would take much to update it to python 3, since (as far as I know) the descriptor protocol hasn’t changed meaningfully.
Edx. It’s free. HarvardX CS50 literarily starts with Scratch the language lol, then C, then finishes with Python. Or you can do the MITx python course.
The last time I looked at that editor it would have been 2001. It was written in Delphi. I did think about switching to C# but that would have restricted me to Windows. Delphi now supports Windows and Mac but not with the control library I used back then. I'm looking at picking up Python with wxWidgets, maybe try again for POVray. Something else I'm interested in could be done with Python and wxWidgets if that works on a Beagle board.
This one's pretty good, but fairly short: [https://youtu.be/N4mEzFDjqtA](https://youtu.be/N4mEzFDjqtA) This one's a lot longer, could be good if you've never done any programming: [https://youtu.be/TV9tSHFAFjg](https://youtu.be/TV9tSHFAFjg) Otherwise just search for "python 3" on youtube. Also look at [https://www.codewars.com](https://www.codewars.com) \- this one's not for learning per se, it's various challenges to help you practice and improve.
Oh I am currently taking the cs50 
Thanks a ton bro 
on linux one can use monodevelope for c# (though I did not use that much) delphi may be too old -- I downloaded your code but did not find a document for how to compile it. and python + pyqt5 is another choice.
No, you can have both installed on your system. But the pro edition provides tonnes of upgrades (specially if you are coding for Django) so you might eventually decided to uninstall the community ed.
Flask won't do the UI, Forms or Database parts out of the box; it's just the webserver bit. There's add-ones for stuff. Django has the batteries included, handles that stuff for you in an opinionated way. If you've never used either Django is probably the easier &amp; more complex of the two options for accomplishing your goal. 
I heard Dataquest is good
I guess Dataquest it is
What happens if you don’t set a timeout? Maybe it’s just doing exactly what it should. The server takes longer to process a request with the given user-agent and your request times out as specified. Edit: This is indeed the case. The server seems to have a problem with the User-Agent ’Chrome/41.0.2228.0’. If you leave that out it will perform like the request without the headers.
Yeah, the cover work is pretty special.
I am working on SaaS platform for recruiters/recruting agencies. It has features of ATS (applicant tracking system) and has built-in "career page" which lists available offers and allows candidates to apply :)
[removed]
Yeah it seems good enough you should also try codalecademy
No, but I'd recommend doing so, just to save space and keep your configurations not mismatched. Worst case scenario, unless you manually delete your settings after switching to pro, they will still be there. And Pro has the option to sync most settings with your Jetbrains account, so there isn't really a benefit to keeping the community edition (unless you wish to specifically create plugins and ensure they work in the community edition).
Very helpful.
I'm following this idea over [here](https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/95886/algorithm-for-using-power-series-to-numerically-solve-a-partial-differential-equ). 
I've been wanting to use hypothesis for a while now. I guess I'd say the biggest blockers have been inertia, and lack of an obvious way to turn failing inputs into permanent tests. I'm going to want a case discovered by hypothesis to be addable to the (or a) decorator to the test similarly to how a `pytest.mark.parametrize` would work, as a means of ensuring that test case is always executed on CI and other people's computers. Given that a hypothesis test is already the definition of the test I want Im also thinking that the stateful testing section would naturally extend well to testing rest apis as intricate integration tests, though it might take a lot of effort to generate. this would make my above issue even more important. if I can cause a 500, I really want a guaranteed run test to prove the bug was fixed 
From the documentation, it looks like you would use `response.set_cookie`. The `Response` class in webapp2 is based on the one from `WebOb`, which is documented [here](https://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/webob/en/stable/api/response.html).
Yes very much so. Though, not thoroughly enough that mypy quits complaining.
This is pretty cool. I will admit, as green as I am in Python I read: &gt; Can you see how easy it is with pywin32 to interface with the system to create a Windows Service? I looked at the code, chuckled and thoughts "Yeaaahhhh, easy..."
awesome! Definitely trying this out! Though I have written a python script that runs in the background like an application . It blocks certain websites within the given period of time. I usually block the porn websites when I am working Incase i might change my mind and Dutch work lol 
Aw surely not! It mainly evolved from just trying to manipulate an image and cropping sections out. Then using tesseract OCR on those crops to variables. Then just text stuff. Once that was done I worked on the screenshot part, Then the Google search part + results.
Fixing damn Gdal in my computer haha
How does conda handle dependenct management? I've only ever used it as an alternative package repository on Windows. What is the equivalent to \`Pipfile\` and \`pyproject.toml\`, which are the core of Pipenv and Poetry?
&gt; Here’s a note on using hostnames with bind(): ... For deterministic behavior use a numeric address in host portion. For this learning exercise sure, but once you know what a socket it is learn how name lookups work and use them. Outside of home and learning never hardcode a remote IP in your program.
That's not how you really learn Python 3 though. Just remember. It'll get you started, but a robust understanding of the language will require to actually read the documentation (either snatches of the reference, or the full tutorial and more), or other sources. And to really appreciate Python, you'll have to learn some selected bits of the rest of the ecosystem. Videos are not usually a compact, nor obviously complete source of information. The production and download cost is higher.
Wow, I read through this last night. What an education! Very well done. Thanks for posting this. Now I have to think up an application so I can use it!
You're quite right, I forgot about the case that you mention.
Looked through it, it's all awesome! Heck, as long as it does what you need it to do, it's good code.
Oooh no, will look into it!
I would not advise following the author's recommendations on name lookups. Times to use IP addresses (with IPv4 examples): - Loopback (127.0.0.1) - Broadcast (255.255.255.255) - Multicast groups (224.0.0.0 through 239.255.255.255) - When sending a DNS request Times to use interface names: - When not binding to all interfaces (not 0.0.0.0) Times to use names: - Everything else The author seems to have two reasons they don't like name lookups: - It doesn't always resolve to the same thing - SECURITY!!!11! For the first thing imagine that rather than storing things to `~/` or `%userprofile%` or using other PATH variables you said "PATH variables could change, I'm going to hardcore the path to the user directory so it's consistent". Now if it changes or additional users want to use the program it requires modifications to the source code and upgrading all clients instead of just working. DNS is the same thing, it's like a synced PATH list between all systems, it's not a problem that it changes it's SUPPOSED to change so things keep working. Alternatively remember this, IPs are not permanent either (hence DNS). For the security portion I don't even know where to start... but I guess the simplest explanation would be to imagine you needed to deliver your paycheck to the bank every week using your account info. To make this secure you say "instead of looking up where the bank is on Google Maps I'll just always go to the same address and give them my money and account info". Clearly this is no more secure from the fact the bank may simply move and you'll still try to connect to hand over your money and account info. On a more technical level the author also mentions TLS, this is what you should do if you need security. Ask the server you are connecting to provide cryptographic proof it is who you think it is and then begin sending your money and account info in the encrypted tunnel so nobody else sees your PIN. Alternatively remember this, IPs are spoofable. The bank could be open at the same address it always has been and you connect to that address but it not be the real bank. &amp;nbsp; /rant of a guy that has moved literally thousands of applications and run into that one app guy that had a DNS issue 10 years ago and hardcoded everything since.
The project is now compiled with Windows C++ compiler
It's simple code, just lots of it. Standard windows paradigm, lots and lots of boilerplate code any time you want to talk to the OS directly.
Yeah they're good. I also hears that Dataquest is good too
Of course, I have no need to modify them that way. Just stumbled on that behavior while debugging, and it felt weird to me.
Actually this looks new to me too, some interesting design to the project structure, will investigate cheers
You can already do that with threading.Event and call if is_set(): return instead of thredo.sleep. Besides, his API is no more simple than using stdlib pools. I'm really not convinced on this one.
First, why would the author take the time to screenshot his/her terminal rather than use code formatting? More effort and worse result. Second, Using `"""text"""` without setting it equal to something or outside of a docstring (which *is* implicitly setting it to `__doc__`) is bad form. Use comments. Or again, if this is line code, just use that. Aside from all of that, does anyone else feel like Medium's content is pretty bad. It's like the crappy youtube content of old where it was about about views without actually having *good* content? Not to mention how Medium has two "sticky" banners diminishing the experience. 
You mean I have to read! 
Very helpful
My path to python was more from a backbend/Linux/ops/shell path but I was surprise by the simplicity of the code that I read which was written by my best devs. (Repeatability).. I confessed that classes frankly melted my mind and asked why they used so many simple and explicit functions... The feedback was (to illiterate).... Dude.. That's OK, actually that's cool... there is a place for fancy data models/classes... but actually you have been doing the right thing.... Keep things simple, leave comments, make lots of obvious functions.. Leave your final main logic as a series of easy to read function calls.... That's actually awesome! This feedback meant a lot to me and made my ongoing move to golang much more natural also.. Still have python as 80% of my daily goto (and I love it)... My only caveat is that when I need threading, I go go.... Disclaimer... Not a golang plug, a KISS plug.. The right tools for right job thing..
This type of scraper isn't allowed on reddit and can get your account banned if you use it on an account. You must use their API.
Ok can you tell me more on what I have to read maybe with some links if you don't mind Plus how do I learn selected bits? 
Can you share the code ?
I’ve started a new project recently and I don’t know python, i have been developing for about 10 years in other languages. I found data camp useful because I could sit and go through the basics of how types work etc and the few fundamentals before starting on my own. I did it while my wife watched crap on tv and it meant I got a good head start. I would recommend it to get anyone started but then go off and actually build something :)
Ok. I'm not fully versed in putting by any stretch but from what I'm reading you are running this loop every 15 minutes? If so could you not use os to find the system time and only run it if it's in the proper range?
No, it's well within the bounds of an amateur learning the language. I'd think about using the sqlite3 module to store the data as you sample it if you have some basic SQL history. Don't bother with an ORM if you're familar with writing SQL statements, it'll only add a layer of confusion you don't really need at the start. Using sqlite3 is really easy and quick and there's a tonne of examples out there. Good luck and enjoy learning!
How does Datacamp compare to Dataquest?
Google "Choropleth python". Plotly has a good library too. 
To me (a person who writes code for a living) connecting sensors and getting a stable reading from them is a lot more work than writing a bit of code to accomplish what you want. Sounds like the hardware stuff is nearly ready, so no I don't think this is too ambitious.
I did a lot of work one summer doing stuff like this. Check out Fuzzywuzzy by Seatgeek. They have a bunch of cool functions that fit different needs. 
Very nice. Don't forget pov-ray has radiosity settings for diffuse light and soft shadows.
Rarely or if at all is C/C++ `(Win32 API's)` used to code Windows Services, since C# and the `.NET` framework is available when writing Windows services and the CLR doesn't cause any problems such as when writing Windows shell extensions. Even Microsoft themselves recommend C# for Windows Services. Let me give you some of my insights. I recently wrote a C# Windows Service for a multi-tier application and I have to say the process is much easier in C# since Visual Studio gets you up and running quickly and the end result probably performs better than python. The C# route also lets you do a lot actually. The `.NET` framework also provides several Windows service oriented classes (i.e: the `System.ServiceProcess` namespace) to make life easier. `Win32` also provides a very basic `winsvc.h` header file to work with services. Needless to say, the `Win32` approach is tiresome. Use the `Win32` approach if say for example you do not have the .NET framework or the .NET framework has been disabled due to security concerns or such edge cases. Another reason is documentation, The C# route for writing Windows services is well documented and obscure items such as informing Windows if there is a delay in starting the service are well covered, whereas I cannot say the same for `pywin32`. Other complains regarding using python in this context is that async is just hard in python. Maybe its just me but its not as straightforward as C# and asynchronous code is often used in Windows Services. All in all I would discourage the usage of python to write windows services. Do not do it unless its an extremely lightweight service and you have absolutely no experience with C#. Trust me I am a die hard pythonist at core but this is the wrong tool for the job.
So... ? 3.6.. and 3.7 are already out dude. Who cares about this minor?
And? I use grep all the time. Finding things from the shell is hella fast. https://adamdrake.com/command-line-tools-can-be-235x-faster-than-your-hadoop-cluster.html 
I wrote a tool this week that works with Mullvad VPN, called Mullpy. It is a CLI wrapper for Mullvad's API and it shows you if you're connected through Mullvad's servers (secured), if you're not secured then it turns red and gives you a warning. It also checks for open ports and DNS leaking. On the development side it got testing, code coverage, CI/CD with travis and its repo on Pypi. Here's the link of the project if you're interested: https://github.com/franccesco/mullpy
Learnt python last month. So pretty much a beginner. Learnt pygame this week and made a few games. Parallely learning Django to make a small file upload server on my laptop for an event at school.

Well Python still has to call the Win32 API which is always fun to work with...
It's definitely ambitious at first glance, but honestly, just getting and interpreting the data is probably the hardest part of this sort of project. It sounds like you've got that mostly figured out already, so now you just have to get the other sensors hooked up and start interpreting and manipulating the data.
I mean, there's only like 6 functions that you can overload and the example only uses 3 of them ("start", "stop" and "main"). Seems pretty simple to me. 
Powershell would be good too
Sure pm me!
Do you mean the ability to see the variables created at the end of running the script? In pycharm this is easy. Top right of the GUI where the run button is, click on the down arrow (or right, click, can't remember), then look for 'Edit configuration'. On the big preferences screen that appears, look for a checkbox for 'run with python console' or similar. This will mean that when you run your script it will show the variables on the right hand side in a variable viewer like you may be used to. Can't help you with the graphing though. 
Where
This isn’t google bro.
[https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&amp;q=python,%2Fm%2F0261x8t](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&amp;q=python,%2Fm%2F0261x8t) Seems to me like there is a battle going on.
This is reasonably within bounds. For me, setting up the hardware and reading the correct values sounds much harder than hooking up a SQL database for storing data. With my limited time working on a microcontroller, setting up LEDs was the easiest part. For reading and handling data from all sensors, you can create a task for every sensor and maybe try to run them in a round robin schedule.. something like a RTOS?
Learning some PowerShell will make creating windows services much much easier. https://yaplex.com/blog/create-a-windows-service-using-powershell
Thanks for the feedback. Can you give me a specific change I should make?
Could you just run the Hypothesis strategy, and then test using whatever falsifying example it spits out? Like use that output in pytest.mark.parametrize. It would be kind of manual but it would ensure that the input never changes.
Alternatively, $ python
Spyder is designed to be more like MATLAB. PyCharm is a real IDE for people doing actual software development.
sure, it's just unfortunate that I would need to define the same test twice. it would be ideal if I could say: use these specific examples first, then start randomly choosing
pip's often separately installed.
Yes, exactly. I'm also slowly making my students transition to `pipenv`, so I want to verify everything works correctly. As a nice addition, I'm using [asciimatics](https://github.com/peterbrittain/asciimatics/), which requires Pillow. If that installation worked, they're pretty safe to install pretty much anything.
Sorry haven’t tried dataquest
So, a little bit of context. I made this dummy package just to help our students verify their **whole** python setup was working correctly (python, pipenv / virtualenvs, etc). I could have made them install requests, open a shell and type `import requests`, but where's the fun in that, right?
I starred this
There are plenty of users who can't move to newer versions for whatever reason--old LTS Linux distros, enterprise-class businesses, and so on. The Python Core Dev community commits to maintaining old releases for five years with security fixes. This is one of those releases. No, I wouldn't recommend 3.5 for new work, and if you can install any version you like I would definitely recommend 3.7. But just because you see no point in new releases of 3.5 doesn't mean nobody sees a point in new releases of 3.5.
these are all fair points. 
Can you use a GPL license? Because if so then PyQt works great.
You don't need to buy the license for PyQt if your app is licensed under [GPL](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl).
this GPL license is very confusing , but here is what am doing , i want to use PyQt on my app ( not open source it ) and it is for commercial use , i will not make any changes to the PyQt source code , just use the framework for building GUI
Two things jumped out at me. First, it looks like you're shortening the URLs in order. The URL I got was /bo, and after poking around I found /bm, /bl, and back to /ba which led to some cloudflare thing. The point is, don't just increment some base32 value, generate random entries. Second it's "a url", not "an url". Good luck!
When I went to the link for a moment I thought it was going to be a xkcd comic.
&gt; PySide2 i have read that this project was abandoned , is there any truth to that ? how about stability ?
Wasn't this already posted a little while ago?
Thanks. Did you do data_column to data_column (i.e. cell to cell) comparison ? If so was that just iterate thru the rows and apply the call to fuzz function(s) ?
You are probably looking towards either a script not a program unless you're keen on making one. I would recommend java for that kind of thing 
http://blog.qt.io/blog/2018/04/13/qt-for-python-is-coming-to-a-computer-near-you/ http://blog.qt.io/blog/2018/06/13/qt-python-5-11-released/ http://blog.qt.io/blog/2018/07/17/qt-python-available-pypi/ Check the dates http://wiki.qt.io/Qt_for_Python 
I find Java has too much boilerplate for this kind of use, as a simple Python script would do the job just fine.
Yeah. I always turn to python first when writing scripts like this so I think you are on the right track.
Having written a few scrapers in both ruby &amp; python, here's some general topics you'll want to get familiar with: 1. HTTP requests - understand what the methods (GET, POST, etc) do, what a request consists of (URI), and how headers &amp; cookies work 2. Use that knowledge to code against a python http lib; either Requests or http.client should be fine to start 3. HTML, CSS, JS - understand the syntax &amp; semantics of page layout, and how both CSS &amp; JavaScript manipulate the page 4. Use HTML knowledge to understand xpath selectors - these allow you to pull specific content out of a page 5. Find a python HTML parser that supports xpath; lxml should be fine for this 7. Plan your code based on your request &amp; parsing needs. For instance, you may need to do a GET to receive cookies before being able to POST 8. Implement &amp; test. This part's all on you :) 
Why don't you just `time.sleep()` for the appropriate amount of hours to skip the inactive period?
Powershell is great if you want to make a small program a service in your *local computer*. If you are a software programmer and not a system administrator, most of the time you have anything to do with Windows services, they would need to be deployed onto client machines. Nonetheless its handy to know just in case. 
Conda s the way imo
This is odd to me. I don't religiously follow minor version releases like this, but is there some legit insurmountable difference between 3.5 -&gt; 3.7 that cant be reasonably refactored in your existing code base fairly easily? Can you give some concrete example as to why such a refactor is infeasible? Im not being judgemental or condescending. I just hear this a lot and can't professionally come up with an example in all of our disparate code bases why maintaining some minor release like 3.5 vs upgrading to 3.7 is such a chore.
Visual studio. I dont like it, but its the debug king.
I wrote something similar about a month ago using the attrs library instead of NamedTuple. It's definitely the best way to deserialize nested JSON structures because right now it's essentially impossible. I was inspired by the rust serde library which is freaking amazing. The typing module is pretty messy, I'm really not a fan of its current state. It feels like it's unfinished. I had read the source code of the module to figure out how to get the generic type parameters at runtime. https://gist.github.com/sbstp/5a7387ed212ef6e98b5d9d9ab81fa6ab
If you have no coding skill then you can't write a scraper/downloader. If you want to learn python so you **can** write a scraper/downloader then you should ask on /r/learnpython *after* looking at the [learning resources in the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/index#wiki_new_to_programming.3F).
It does now in 3.7: https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/collections.html#namedtuple-factory-function-for-tuples-with-named-fields You could change an attribute before to add the functionality, but it didn't exist normally.
Can the C# approach be done entirely for free? I'm not familiar with C# development so I don't know if the compiler is free or not.
Curious, why is pipenv the requirement?
Here’s the relevant GitHub http://matthewearl.github.io/2018/06/28/smb-level-extractor/
Absolutely Visual Studio Community is more than adequate for majority of tasks including writing Windows services and free of charge.
It is pretty straight forward. but it still makes me happy that I don't have to screw around with all this stuff on Linux
typing_inspect is the way to go for runtime type inspection. 
Nice!! Question: does it work with the new dataclasses?
It's on my todo list to test this. But I believe it should, since data classes are just `@dataclass` annotate normal classes, so the ctor (`__init__`) is auto generated for them, and that's what the library uses.
Thanks. Yes, `serde` is awesome. I also use it in one project. :)
The Python standard library has [sched](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/sched.html) for both 2 and 3. [schedule](https://github.com/dbader/schedule) lets you do something like: import schedule import time def job(): print("I'm working...") schedule.every(15).minutes.do(job) while True: schedule.run_pending() [APScheduler](https://github.com/agronholm/apscheduler) has three built-in scheduling systems you can use: * Cron-style scheduling (with optional start/end times) * Interval-based execution (runs jobs on even intervals, with optional start/end times) * One-off delayed execution (runs jobs once, on a set date/time) See this Stack Overflow question for more: [link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/373335/how-do-i-get-a-cron-like-scheduler-in-python)
Oh my bad, I thought that the NamedTuple was required to have type annotations, similar to the @dataclass magic. I haven't really followed the development of data classes or types.
Haha, amazing!
Conda is a descent package manager, but it's still a little bit a less-standard version. We recommend mini-conda to students that are just getting started. Anaconda is definitively too bloated IMO.
It's not a requirement, but our recommendation. We teach them how to use virtualenvs, and now we're slowly switching to pipenv.
Not simple. If by no programming experience you do not know what variables are for example... this would be very difficult to do.
Damn, that's super cool. I like your method for detecting the end of the fingertip - very clever.
I would probably just tweak some sizing and layouts maybe. Looks crazy on my iPhone https://imgur.com/a/qi1RZJp
Awesome. Please let me know if you run into anything. :)
looks great and just like what I need for a software project of mine. Unfortunately I'm limited to python3.4 on the machine where it runs. Which parts make this 3.6.5 and up?
I would try /r/cscareerquestions. I think "months" is on the fast side for someone who is studying full time on a very streamlined path and having resume advantages. "Years" is on the slow side maybe if you're doing it part-time without anyone helping you. Around a year I think is reasonable. Random scripting jobs on upwork are very low pay as there is a lot of competition for those jobs from third world countries. In general there is a lot more competition for full-time remote jobs. Harder to get them, lower pay, and generally they want previous remote work and not junior level. Contracting is easier to find but sometimes lower pay, and requires more legwork and is more unstable. Networking or access to potential clients will make a big difference. I've heard that it's pretty hard to get data science jobs as a lot of companies are looking for masters/phds for these roles. I imagine it's even harder for remote. It might be a good idea to try looking at some of the remote job boards and see what kinds of jobs are popular and what kind of credentials they're looking for and what general pay looks like.
Absolutely. Very utilitarian!!!
To me it looks like that job is more about data systems than data analysis. You're not really analyzing the data, more building the systems for moving and managing data. Something like this course would match that job description more: https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-systems. 
Even though I am a huge python fan myself wouldn't it be a little easier to solve this particular case with sort of bash(or powershell) + wget(or curl) combo?
tkinter can be used to build decently complex app already.
Thanks a lot for your response. I appreciate the time taken. Do you think an online tutor would be of great benefit? Or just a better route to do something like a nanodegree where you get regular contact and feedback with a tutor and a course that's a little more defined?
Ok here's how you get started. You want to do data science? I hope you have a bunch of stats experience (regressions, hypothesis testing, clustering, some linear algebra). The reason why people ask for MS/PhD for data science is experience in the (sub)discipline(s) usually leads the practitioner to pursue those grad degrees (since academically, the field is really new, so you get a lot of people who developed some techniques/theory in industry and turned it into research projects). it is much easier to teach the programming/ML side to someone who has the math understanding vs. the other way around. Since your day job is geospatial, I would definitely keep doing the application of scripting/automation to your current job. You want to focus initially on toolbuilding and how Python can "make your life easier". Like preprocessing data or postprocessing data, or doing transforms. In terms of hobbies, perhaps there are some problems outside of work that might benefit from software/automation? Like anything that deals with data management. Your principal concept when learning Python is: DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself. If you find yourself copy-pasting a lot of statements, maybe that can be refactored to more generic functions. If you find yourself copy-pasting a lot of functions that only change a little bit, perhaps they can be refactored to classes that use inheritance or composition. Regarding actual "credentials" (nanodegrees/certs/etc.): consider them flair. They help your resume/CV stand out a bit from ones that don't have those credentials. But practical knowledge will almost always be required to be demonstrated. Any coding position will include basic tests that you can actually think through how you'd solve a problem using a bit of code.
This is super cool, but on a side note, is anyone else ever mildly grossed out about data science style code being less idiomatic?
Awesome response. Thank you.
Take a look at goodgrids.com. Talk to me if the pricing is a problem.

**Statistical classification** In machine learning and statistics, classification is the problem of identifying to which of a set of categories (sub-populations) a new observation belongs, on the basis of a training set of data containing observations (or instances) whose category membership is known. Examples are assigning a given email to the "spam" or "non-spam" class, and assigning a diagnosis to a given patient based on observed characteristics of the patient (gender, blood pressure, presence or absence of certain symptoms, etc.). Classification is an example of pattern recognition. In the terminology of machine learning, classification is considered an instance of supervised learning, i.e. *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Python/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28
Wasnt rest_framework.serializers/Pylons.colander made for this exact purpose?
&gt; However, if you're just starting out with Python, or programming in general, start at the beginning. Knowing the fundamentals is really important. Can't I pay a freelancer? 
OK, for me it's the opposite. I worked without type annotations but currently running `mypy --strict` is part of our CI for all Python projects. I'm very happy about: - all the bugs that did not make it into production - the manual type tests I did not have to write - the help my IDE can now offer - the easier and more confident refactorings But of course I can not prove it with measurements. It's more some kind of gut feeling. Did you already work with a modern statically-typed language? It can become like a kind of drug, and you're hooked forever. ;)
I've done something similar, the thumb and pointer are used to move a slider that controls the brightness and volume of a computer. 
Realy cool project!! GG
That was so interesting!!! Partial payment without write off is really not as dry a subject as one might think. Really mind-blowing stuff! How can I become an Odoo programmer?
Awesome! Thanks for sharing. 
I upgraded as well around 2 weeks ago. Heads up: some plugins like native Cython support did not seem to work when I imported settings from the Community version. I had to reinstall and say “NO!” to the import settings prompt. So if something isn’t working as it should, just say no
Don't use a Designer. Seriously. Try a framework like Enaml ( https://github.com/nucleic/enaml ). It's so much better than using a Designer and gives you a really good MVC framework from the outset. This builds off PyQt so you can integrate standard PyQt stuff very easily. Install enaml using conda / anaconda.
Not that I know of, but you can script many IDEs.
That’s actually really cool
Have you tried pew? I find it way easier to use.
Code golf is fun, but have you ever tried code craps
I think this is fantastic! I love that it's not trying to be some massive toolkit for making games, has set defined parameters around capabilities and sticks to them. Looking through the examples it seems pretty obvious as to how things work, a couple of head scratchers but going back and forth looking at the API helped to make some sense of things. It appears to leverage glfw for rendering, which means it should run on a Raspberry Pi. Be neat to make a little video game console of home made games out of a RPiZero.
You will never get a remote job with no experience. Any job you get is going to want you to come into the office until you've got a few years under your belt and they are confident you can do the job without direct supervision.
Have you ever tried using importlib? If so, how would you compare your script to it? Also, shame it is only for macOS and Linux. 
They already have `lambda`, it makes sense to stay DRY.
I think I have used it once maybe. It didn't seem too different from the original import system but I am not sure. In my script your python code just needs to write "import xyz" irrespective of where it is in the project directory structure. Hence I found it useful. It also supports the use case of using external resources like text files etc and those could be found in "pyosphere/resources", provided you mention which resources you would like to include in the config file. Also the reason it wasn't on windows was because its a bash script and windows doesn't have a bourne like shell atleast natively. However you could refer to this answer on SO and maybe try it out (No guarantee however) : https://superuser.com/a/373711 Also do leave a star if you liked it ! Helps the repo get noticed. Thanks !
Just reminded me of this quote: &gt; “We think we are creating the system for our own purposes. We believe we are making it in our own image... But the computer is not really like us. It is a projection of a very slim part of ourselves: that portion devoted to logic, order, rule, and clarity.” &gt; &gt; — Ellen Ullman

&gt; I don't understand. The file name is a required argument to initialize and all 'subclasses' for that particular type of JSON response will be in the same file. The initial class name and file name are essentially the same. I was thinking about responses from multiple API endpoints that belong together, so if you're querying, say, an API for museums, that has resources like `GET /museum/louvre/artworks` that returns a list of artworks that hang in the Louvre, but you might also query things like `GET /museum/louvre/employee/dave` to get access to resource describing an employee named Dave who works there. Currently, to get both top-level classes in the same module, you'd need to make two calls to `APIClassify` with `gettext=True` and write them out yourself. &gt; AFIK dataclasses are for Python3.7 only, right? Yep. It's a shame you're on 3.6, because you could generate code that looks like this: @dataclass class MyClass_Foo: ham: str @dataclass class MyClass: foo: MyClass_Foo ... and you're 90% of the way there. Dataclasses can automatically generate nice `__repr__`, `__init__`, comparison methods, etc. --- A project that might interest you I forgot about until just now: [Quicktype](https://app.quicktype.io/?sample=us-avg-temperatures&amp;lang=python). It seems you have to log in now to change options which is a shame.

I cant use sleep because some times the script will take longer or shorter to post data depending on size of data. Also a serial read function relies on input from an arduino and other tasks... Also depending on circumstances the PI will reboot. 
I’ll be checking this out. Just gone done reading Ready Player One and I’m itching to write a retro game
Thanks, fixed it. 
The exercise of figuring that out from the standard library documentation, googling "awesome python", or however you do research for your particular field (e.g., molecular chemistry, basic statistics, process control, etc.) is part of the learning experience. Hard to swallow answer, but a realistic one. Nobody'll handhold you as nice as would be in the real world.
You could just calculate the remaining sleep time.
Thanks.. That makes sense..
I am a python beginner, so a STUPID question here: Can I play Mario Bros using python with this git link?
not to be a jerk, but what are the advantages/disavantages of using Pyxel versus using something similar like \[Arcade\]([https://github.com/pvcraven/arcade](https://github.com/pvcraven/arcade)) ?
Continuing my work from here: https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/91hp59/whats_everyone_working_on_this_week/e2yb8tx/ Overcame the initial hurdle of injecting VBA into a `.xlsm` document for testing purposes. Fundamentally, this is a tricky problem but I figured it out using some `win32api` libraries. It still requires some more work, and after I figure it out, the next task will be to figure out how to generate the Report Automatically. After that I will have to look into how the report is being generated using VBA for the latest version of the plugin, and address the problems with the plugin. 
What do you mean by Python job automation? Are you automating your `job`? Or are you talking more in terms of devops.. as in automating the process of the `deploying-to-production` job?
`pandas` is just a data wrangling library. You can do everything that pandas does using lists/dicts etc.. Pandas just makes it amazing easily to do the same and provides lots of helper functions. You will need to tie together multiple libraries to do what you are trying to do. If you are trying to do machine learning look into `sklearn` or `keras`
For sure I've used that before, made me confused so I checked this post out

/u/gournian What is `micropython`?
You need requirements.txt
Why did you chose to run in on the `rasberry pi`? Because of compute, memory constraints.. it seems a harder task to accomplish compared to say running it on AWS or a laptop..
I'm not really sure what problem is being solved here. *Always using Latest version of a dependency? Lock it in to a specific version using language-specific, and change it in a branch. *Upgrading in a change a dependency breaks the build? Don't merge that change. *Dependency isn't immutable, so it could be replaced after the first fetch? Cache all dependencies, such as with Artifactory, and deny connections from build hosts to everything else.
Yes it would take much more time to render, but it can look really nice, or it might look good as a demonstration image of what your tool can do for people who want to use it to show off. It could just be a simple argument which includes the few required lines of pov code.
You need `package==desired.version`
I know it's rare, but sometimes maintainers change a package without changing the version number. I've been in situations when this has delayed a release.
Interesting project, and I didn't know much about the type checking system in Python until I just started reading over your code and doing a bit of research. Very neat, very educational. A few comments/possible suggestions for your consideration: **1. "Type Safety"** I believe there is a difference between "type safety" and "static type checking". This facilitates the latter, while the former has more to do with the implementation of Python itself, preventing implicit type casting and things of that nature. Check it out and maybe consider rebranding it a bit accordingly. **2. What does it do, then?** My understanding is that type annotations and python have no demonstrable effect on the output of the code, but may be used by other tools like mypy to provide static type checking or performance benefits. This doesn't provide static type checking or performance benefits, or anything to do with type safety, really, does it? Rather, it enforces types for parameters at the time an object is called, right? When you say: &gt; It uses the type information of your target class to safely unpack the dictionary into an object. It throws exceptions with meaningful details in their associated values in case of an error like: &gt; &gt;-missing a field &gt; -a field having the wrong type &gt; It also supports: &gt; -optional values being omitted instead of being None explicitly &gt; -skipping superfluous fields in the source dict In all cases but the last, this is really close to behavior I expect as normal Python behavior, albeit that an error will usually only be thrown from the line of code that tries to execute the erroneous type. In the case of the last case ("skipping superfluous fields"), I didn't see how to define what is skipped, or how superfluous is defined. I do see checking the type at the time the object is called as beneficial in some cases (for example, if the object is just a data container representing some kind of data store), but that value is really lost in the descriptions of "type-safe JSON deserialization" and the like. If anything, it's more useful during re-serialization to ensure the appropriate output. **2. JSON Deserialization to tuple in the README.md** &gt;Imagine your application receives a JSON string representing an entity you need to handle: import json tobi = json.loads(''' ...''') &gt;Now you start to work with it. Somewhere deep in your business logic you have: name_length = len(tobi['name']) &gt;But that's only fine if the original JSON string was well-behaved. If it had "name": "Tobias", in it, you would get: name_length = len(tobi['name']) TypeError: tuple indices must be integers or slices, not str``` I actually don't get this. If there were extra brackets I or something I can see ```json.loads()``` returning a list or something, so I assume that's what you meant, but I'm not 100% sure. **3. unpack_json() naming** In your README.md, I think you confuse `unpack_json()` for `unpack_dict()`. I see you have an `unpack_dict()` method in the code, but the readme shows `unpack_json(Human, json.loads('''{data'}'')`, which doesn't seem correct. **4. Refactor unpack_dict()** The fact that unpack_dict() takes a function or class object as argument is a good indicator that you could structure this as a closure, and benefit from the very elegant decorator syntax. Rather than asking the user to use your own function all over the place any time they want to make an object call through your library, you let them modify their objects with a decorator that adds the functionality directly to their objects. from undictify import check_types @check_types class Human(TypedNamedTuple): name: str age: int data = {name: 'Tobias', age: '100'} tobias: Human = Human(**data) As an argument in favor of the above recommendation, it seems reasonable to assume that you want the type checking to occur any time the object is called, but it seems unlikely to me that you would want to only use the checking functionality some of the time when calling the object. This really seems like it should be a function of the object itself, either via inheritance or decoration. Also, it is more pythonic, because it utilizes the appropriate language-specific syntax for dict unpacking (`obj(**dict)`), and frees the library user from having to memorize a special `unpack_whatever()` syntax. And better still, it prevents users from needing to `from types import NamedTuple` in order to use your library, while requiring 0 additional import statements in order to use your library, as one no longer needs to call the `unpack_dict()` function directly. 
haha what a take :) Automating daily tasks that are unrelated to programming. But this is the week I'm deploying this automation tool to our computers. Hopefully eventually automating everything.

Can anyone install? I get this error on macos. The URL given returns a 404. \&gt;&gt;&gt;pip3 install pyxel Collecting pyxel Could not fetch URL https://pypi.python.org/simple/pyxel/: There was a problem confirming the ssl certificate: [SSL: TLSV1_ALERT_PROTOCOL_VERSION] tlsv1 alert protocol version (_ssl.c:600) - skipping Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement pyxel (from versions: ) No matching distribution found for pyxel
That is correct, it is not possible to replace an exact package. However it is possible to upload a package with the exact same version but a higher install preference. eg if someone uploads a new .whl package, that will take precedence over a .tar.gz package. This effectively allows users to replace packages.
Could you imagine if this was available in the 1990s? 
Thanks so much for this great response! &gt; I believe there is a difference between "type safety" and "static type checking" [...] Yes, writing type annotations and having the IDE / `mypy` finding errors it static type checking. undictify uses static type annotations, but what it provides is something I would call (runtime) type safety for dictionary unpacking. But yeah, terminology is sometimes a bit squishy. &gt; This doesn't provide static type checking or performance benefits, or anything to do with type safety, really, does it? Rather, it enforces types for parameters at the time an object is called, right? Yes, exactly. :) &gt; In all cases but the last, this is really close to behavior I expect as normal Python behavior, albeit that an error will usually only be thrown from the line of code that tries to execute the erroneous type Yes and no. When you for example receive a JSON object you may or may not detect by some other error deep in your business logic code that some field has the wrong type. It depends on what you do with the values. &gt; In the case of the last case ("skipping superfluous fields"), I didn't see how to define what is skipped, or how superfluous is defined. Thanks for the remark. I just [added a short explanation of it](https://github.com/Dobiasd/undictify/commit/f5e433143cb35068570f8924191e8d27c426ef6a). &gt; If anything, it's more useful during re-serialization to ensure the appropriate output. That sounds interesting, but I don't understand what you mean. Could you please elaborate? &gt; unpack_json() naming [...] Oh, yes. Thank you very much. I [just removed all references to `unpack_json`](https://github.com/Dobiasd/undictify/commit/0af1f198831b8df2caa9fcd20fd5f04661515d56). It's only a small wrapper around `unpack_dict` and `json.loads` anyways, so not mentioning it at all, makes things clearer. &gt; 4. Refactor unpack_dict() [...] Wow, that is an awesome suggestion! I really like it. I agree with all the arguments you mentioned in its favor. I'll have a look into the decorator stuff, check if I can implement it and get back to you with the results.
Haha no worries. I saw you committing while I was revising my comment. Be sure to re-browse it a little bit, as I made some major changes and I'm not sure what you replied to directly. Particularly, I removed a recommendation to provide a base class in favor of a decorator only. Also I just made some of the writing less abrasive sounding. Sorry, some of the early "questions" had a really obnoxious, almost judgmental tone, which wasn't my intent. I wrote it as I explored your code a bit so it took some revising.

I take it if you still have it
For loops, while loops, and generators all go through python’s interpreter which does have overhead. One way to avoid this overhead is to use functions that do the looping in C under the hood. This is much closer to the metal and much faster. One great thing about using itertools is that iterating things is much more composable than with loops - it’s easier to combine these tools than write a complex for loop. Their point in the docs methinks is that these tools try to base off of these inbuilt functions that are in C under the hood. This is one of the main points of numpy and pandas - when you do an operation on a column or array, there is a loop through the elements but this is done by C code rather than python and is much faster (also faster as the data types are much more densely packed and optimised). Interestingly, recently I’ve discovered that one downside of these inbuilt functions that are built in c is that some arguments are positional only - you can’t use them as keyword arguments. 
Why are Assembly programmers always soaking wet? They work below C-level.
`psutil` definitely does show you CPU usage. Or do you want to track CPU _time_?
Vectorized relates to a set of CPU instructions which are designed to perform the same operation on multiple data items. Traditional CPU design implies that for every operation you need to first set registers to be the operands to that operation. For example, if you want to add two integers using the 32-bit instruction set, you'd set `eax` to first summand, `ebx` to second summand and then `add eax, ebx`. Equivalent vectorized instruction would load into CPU memory a bunch of data and then perform additions on those data. This saves processing time because you don't need to wait for CPU clock on every operation, all of them are performed at the same time, so, essentially you get a speedup equal to the number of elements you can process at one time. These are known as `avx` (process 256 data items at a time) and `avx2`, also 256 items at a time. There's a newer set, `avx-512`, which processes 512 data items at a time.

&gt; I was thinking about responses from multiple API endpoints that belong together, so if you're querying, say, an API for museums, that has resources like GET /museum/louvre/artworks that returns a list of artworks that hang in the Louvre, but you might also query things like GET /museum/louvre/employee/dave to get access to resource describing an employee named Dave who works there. Currently, to get both top-level classes in the same module, you'd need to make two calls to APIClassify with gettext=True and write them out yourself. Ah ok, I was thinking about that too. I just wanted to get a base for stuff before thinking about adding it. The dataclasses do sound nice, maybe support for 3.7 will be better implemented in the near future. I didn't even know about Quicktype! Seems like it does this stuff already. I haven't tried it yet, but it might be close. Guess I can close up shop on mine :P lol

Huh. Have you ever had the idea for something, only to have someone come up with something that seems to be better than what you're already working on? I had an idea that I wanted to work on a library, as a hobby, where I could do GW-BASIC style music like I did on a Tandy 1000. 3-channel squarewave and all. I wrote a parser for PLAY statements, then set it aside. I recently also remembered how, waaaay back years ago, I wanted to write an AGI-style adventure game, but not on AGI. I came up with this idea of sticking to the 3-channel sound but have 320x240 256-color graphics. Had worked out how to do palette shifting and limit framerates to Tandy 1000-era rates. Then this comes along. It's not that what I was doing was any good, it's just that there's always someone more talented than me releasing something just as I'm doing it. I'll probably set it aside for another decade at this point. ;-)

Nice article. And finally, to my relief, one that actually talks about the fact that: * `recv` may not return all bytes requested * `send` may not send all bytes given ... so that you have to deal with their return value to actually make your code robust (or use `sendall` in case of `send`) It's kinda weird though that this is only discussed under "Handling Multiple Connections". Other than that, a very well written extensive article I think. Now, because we normally don't want to concern ourselves with all those low level details of getting some bytes reliable across the network, we will ofcourse not use socket programming directly. Instead we use a higher level protocol such as perhaps Pyro ([https://pyro4.readthedocs.io/](https://pyro4.readthedocs.io/) \- which almost totally abstracts away the actual network communication), or pyzmq, or some http library perhaps (requests comes to mind)

Python comes bundled with a function for computing combinations efficiently. It's itertools.combinations(). But if I understand your problem correctly, there's an even simpler way. You need something that tries every way of rounding each price up or down, correct? Counting from 0 to 2**(N-1), where N is the number of prices, will give you every combination of N binary digits. So if you iterate over this range, and let the Kth digit of the current number determine whether you are rounding the Kth price up or down, you will have tried every combination of rounding choices. You can use &gt;&gt; and % to extract out the Kth digit like so: digit_k = (counter &gt;&gt; k) % 2

Are these things applicable to real world projects and jobs? 
All of them are. The first one is quite niche, though. It's more related to CAD and game development. The other two are very present in enterprise, and the last one is most related to data science. 
Just getting started in python, coming over from powershell. Writing code to document a Meraki organization mainly out of frustration with power shells crappy GUI options. In short, learning Python to make API calls. 
I think the first step is to sort in order of decreasing rounding error. Since the delta on rounding is always 1, then the number of rounding operations to do is always equal to absolute value of sum(ceil(items in list)) - target. Then, you round the numbers in order of lowest "cost" to round until you have enough flipped to meet the target. I'll see if I can get a prototype working... `
I'd say the most educationally interesting one of these is plotting 4d data. It's VERY easy to do it, but if you're going to present it in a school project you'll have to explain what it is, and you'll have to explain the limitations of our 3d senses, and how we are showing a 3d object on a 2d surface. How smart is it to plot 4D data in a 2D screen? If you're looking technically hard, that ain't it. It's quite easy to do it. But, conceptually hard, or rather, challenging, that's your thing. 
Scroll down to the bottom on the front page.
I don't have the slightest clue what problem you're trying to solve. What do the prices have to do with the target? What does the output mean? Further, I'm not sure this is an appropriate subreddit for this post, even if it did make sense internally. This is mostly a news sub, for Python learning questions, try /r/learnpython.
There are 2**N combinations of N binary choices. These are represented as N digits, taking O(N) space. You can pre-calculate the rounding errors for each price, and then use the counter to pick out the errors that will be summed to get the total error for that combination; this requires O(N) space as well.
[and then](https://i.imgur.com/fNQbgYs.png)?
 So, the problem with my solution was that I could not precompute the whole set because of the memory constraints, which means you can't do a sort like that.
---&gt; /r/learnpython 
I'd say: \- add a queue.Queue to your widget \- write a small function that gets an image from this queue and displays it in the gui, then schedules itself again with a \*non-zero\* after() timeout (insert appropriate stop condition in this cycle) \- load/decode the actual images in a background thread and shove them into the queue as they become available
Glad this was the solution for you. Strange though that pip didn't warn about it being out of date. Unless you had a really really old version.
I don't precompute the whole set. I computed two parallel arrays - the ceiling value of each input, and the rounding cost. print the value of prices2. This is what I get: [(1, 0.7), (3, 0.7999999999999998), (5, 0.9000000000000004)] That's the extent of memory consumption. The two sum/map operations are boundary checking. They compute the theoretical sums of rounding all numbers down and all numbers up, to make sure that meeting the target is feasible. 
It's powerful, and a pain in the ass IMO. I develop internal automation/debug tools and we use wx. It's also not particularly pretty but it is significantly easier than TK, if you ask me. 
&gt; I use grep all the time. We were talking about programming languages, ya dingus! &gt; Finding things from the shell is hella fast. But you're not enough of a muppet to assume that grep is fast because Bash is fast, are you?

I like its simplicity. The gui may be simplistic and not very pretty to look at, but its very easy to create something that works. Also a few days ago I posted something over at /r/gamedev about my Boulderdash remake which is an arcade game I made using just Tkinter for the graphics: [https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/92h3j9/bouldercaves\_recreating\_an\_8bit\_era\_arcade\_game/](https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/92h3j9/bouldercaves_recreating_an_8bit_era_arcade_game/) It was a bit surprising to me as well, to be honest, but just Tkinter proved to have enough features and be fast enough to build this game with. It includes a graphical level editor.
Welcome to the community, enjoy and have fun!
https://www.numworks.com/features/ One of my students had one of these last year. It is OK. 
instead of using "lists of dicts of lists" try to think about your data in more conceptual terms. What makes up the list? What type of object is in it? Create a class for this object (or perhaps use a 3.7 dataclass, or namedtuple) and give it properly named attributes. That will make it much easier to reason about your data

The issue with powershell for me is that I'll have to configure restrictions on each and every computer I go to to allow powershell to run the script
tried to log in with test/test, got a rather curious error message.
Why though. Use DBSCAN instead.
Quit trying to break my app ;)
And that would not be the case with Python??? I am asking out of curiosity, I don't use Windows much.
I've done tkinter to prototype, because since it's so simplistic it doesn't take much to get up a window and make it usable. If I push past the prototyping phase, then I'll do either Qt5 or wx, depending on what I'm trying to do. Qt5 for more involved UIs where you might be passing data back and forth between tabs and sub-windows, etc. wx for more basic UIs, as it's a little easier/nicer to work with for small/simple workflows, but quickly gets unwieldy for large projects.
You’ve got all the right moves!
In awesome python tradition it just crashes for me on Fedora 28 using a virtualenv.
Nope once I set it to run from that account then I'm good. Powershell needs to be configured to run unknown scripts
To be fair, there aren't many "mainstream"/commercial applications with GUIs written in Python, period. And if they are, it's usually with Qt.
gitk and git gui are implemented using tk, though in perl rather than python. I guess that the dearth of tkinter applications is caused mainly by the fact that if you want to make a gui application in python, you probably are going to target Windows, Mac, as well as Linux distributions that have older versions of python than you care to support, at which point you're looking at bundling python with your app, at which point you no longer care that much about the included-with-the-batteries benefit of tkinter. Which honestly is the main thing it has going for it - not that it sucks otherwise, but the alternatives don't suck either. 
I'll check that out - for those who are wondering: https://www.quora.com/If-the-algorithms-DBSCAN-OPTICS-and-K-Means-are-compared-which-one-would-be-more-advantageous-Please-state-why
Even as an entry level position for jobs on upwork / collaborations etc? The goal is not to make a career out of it immediately, more to learn whilst I spend a few years travelling and then perhaps find an entry level position when I return home.
I played around on the emulator a little bit and while I like the simplistic feel of it, it seems like it's missing a lot of the functionality of the Ti-Inspire for a calculator in the $100 price range. I like that they made it to where you can write programs in python from the calculator itself but I still have to look into if I could import my own .py files from my computer. This is the closest thing I've found to what I'm looking for so far. Thanks for the link btw. 
&gt; goal is to work remotely....at an entry level Why must you have this requirement ? Entry-level remote Python dev job - they might exist but you'd have to compete with LOTS and lots of Indians &amp; Philipinos etc. 
There's a powershell commandlet for this at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/monitoring/trace-an-email-message/message-trace-faq so there's _some way_ of doing it remotely, so it's possible in python. No idea how. Maybe figure out how the powershell commandlets do it. 
I don't think OP has more than 2 years of professional/corporate work experience. "entry-level remote work" ? that's like I don't know how to make a proper analogy about this...it's like 5'6, 180-lb chubby boy wanting to play in the NBA.....
Yes even on * job sites you can think of - even if you can out-bid the juniors in India/Pakistan/Philipines which I doubt. 
Maybe they tried resizing ?
What you suggested is possible, but I have a hard time believing that non-API-compatible source and binary distributions of the same version of a package are so common that they warrant building yet another packaging tool to work around.
It seems your gripe is with Google search. Next time just go straight to the manual when you need to look something up. python.org &gt; Docs &gt; Language Reference 
The module's api is different between 1.0.16 and 2.
Not much. There are a bunch of fantasy consoles and this is just another of them. I'm interested in this one since it's python, but if it doesn't run in a browser like TIC-80 than I'm much less interested. 
I'm trying to write some test cases but from reading your code I think it wouldn't work. If you have two numbers that can both round to the same whole numbers but have different rounding errors, and the answer rounds one up and one down, it's important to know which is which.

Perhaps it’s shaped like a ‘t’ for Travis 
Tkinter is kind of ugly (improved with ttk, but there are many widgets with no ttk implementation), and some things are kind of awkward (like scroll bars), but it's included in the standard Python installation, which makes it reasonably portable, assuming the target machine has Python. But, of course, the target machine probably won't have Python unless it's a programmer's computer, because Python isn't really suited for end-user applications. It's mostly for server scripting and personal hacking. Actually... I _think_ part of the UI for the major FPGA design software produced by the company I used to work for was done in Tkinter. It was at the very least some flavor of Tcl, but I'm remembering a bug I found there one day (insufficient error-checking on an input box that was supposed to accept a number) produced an error message that was familiar to me because of my experience with Tkinter. However, at that time the company's standard scripting language was Perl (shortly before I left, they started to migrate over to Python, but Python 2, because Python 3 was an untested unstable beta in 2015, right?), so it might not have been Tkinter specifically. But maybe it was. But as far as mainstream applications, even with a generous definition of "mainstream," a thousand times no. Technically, the software I mentioned above is a commercial product, but FPGA designers are far from the typical consumer who sees a slightly dated UI and immediately uninstalls. Nothing's stopping you from using Tkinter for more than tinkering (I've had fun writing chess, snake, Tetris, etc. in Tkinter), but you should keep its limitations in mind.
That's a cool product. I was glad to see SAT &amp; ACT exam approval. Played around with the emulator a bit and, at least graphing, felt much better than the TI-84. Programming in Python rather than TI BASIC would be fantastic as well. Would you say it is lacking in any area?
Thanks for your response. Yes, I am very clueless about the tech job market, hence the post asking for advice. I appreciate your input. Ok, so let's pretend I have 5 years and all the resources required (time, money etc) to get an entry level position that could (one day) go remote. How would you achieve this, and what would you recommend as a solid path to take?
What does "how big will be 150K lines of python give you?" mean?
Well done. Enjoyed your presentation
Tkinter isn't as robust or customisable as other libraries. It's great for small simple commercial programs. Otherwise you can try Qt.
I guess that wasn't very helpful...
Starting to put my plan together to create a machine learning program that's plays Rome 2:total war on multiplayer campaign. Why? Idk the AI isn't challenging because it's designed to be fast I don't know what im doing... I figured I would start with a listening program that records a human player's actions and collects data on screen to see why the player made that action. I was going start by mapping the game's ui and use mouse position and detect clicks to record actions. Right now im still working on a tool to help me map out The mouse coordinate for each UI button location and hopefully write the boolean for me in a new file. My coding skills are about a D so wish me luck.
&gt;python.org &gt; Docs &gt; Language Reference Honestly that isn't helpful at all. &gt; The semantics of non-essential built-in object types and of the built-in functions and modules are described in [The Python Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html#library-index). And https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html#library-index isn't searchable, ctrl+F isn't great either. Ctrl+F "stream", `io` is the second result. Ctrl+F "file", I get 31 results in a meaningless order, none of which are relevant.
I don't use SVG either, but like.... Surely nobody writes SVGs by hand, right? ... Right??
Nice 
Thanks, that's exactly I was looking for.
._.
It's XML, so people definitely write little scripts or sed/awk commands to modify them. It's actually not a terrible way to programmatically fill out a PDF that isn't a "form" (import PDF in Inkscape, add text items where appropriate with some unique string templates, save as SVG, write a find/replace script to fill in the strings you want). I did this with a standard document I had to submit routinely that just needed a few fields updated each month.
I can ask this in /r/learnpython if it's more appropriate, but how can I get PyCharm to give code hints for this? It knows about `pyxel.init()` but nothing else.
&gt; Honestly that isn't helpful at all. It's a syntax/grammar reference, not a library API reference. C'mon, that was a mistake, you know what I meant. &gt;And https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html#library-index isn't searchable Huh? There's a search box right there at the top right. &gt;... ctrl+F isn't great either. Ctrl+F "stream", io is the second result. Ctrl+F "file", I get 31 results in a meaningless order, none of which are relevant. So, your gripe here, then, is your browser's "find in page" utility. You've thus far outlined issues concerning Google's search engine and your web browser's "find" utility. I agree the docs themselves could use some love, but the information you're after is right there.
I am using Atom's shortkey for commenting. I mark two blocks for example (one commented and one - not). When I press ctrl+/ one block uncomments and one comments. :) Different idea have different behavior when doing this so experiement with it. When I write PHP Atom's behavior is to comment a second time the block.
Post the code, not a screenshot.
I'm assuming you are trying to recursively build the result string? You should know that strings in python are immutable, so changes to the result binding in a function will not be visible from the caller. Either explicitly return the new string or wrap it in a mutable string builder object.

We are seriously looking at oitnb. It is a clone of black (which is just to uncompromising and selected the wrong quotes style), so it uses black's before-and-after AST checking. The extra commandline options for invoking a visual differ (meld), and unwrapping multi-line strings, both work well for us and seem to come from a practical use on real projects. You can also select double quotes (if you have too). Its per-project configuration initially seemed a bit weird, but at least it does not add another file to the project ( config is read from your \_\_init\_\_.py file). Using meld allows us to see what might get mangled by oitnb and then inserting some "# fmt: off" directly in the source. There is a utility (omeld) to compare (mercurial) revisions before the application of oitnb with those after. Getting that integrated with git ( [https://stackoverflow.com/q/51683391/10179234](https://stackoverflow.com/q/51683391/10179234) ) in an acceptable way, seems the only thing keeping us from integrating oitnb in our tool-chain despite its alpha status.
To quote my original post: &gt; Clicking "file object" leads to https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-file-object &gt; There are actually three categories of file objects: raw binary files, buffered binary files and text files. Their interfaces are defined in the io module. The canonical way to create a file object is by using the open() function. &gt; You have to click "io" to find the API for file objects. Clicking "raw binary files, buffered binary files and text files" is useless. Clicking "open()" is useless.
Having once tried to cx-freeze a Tkinter application, I am painfully aware of that. I therefore specifically said "standard Python installation" to include only the official PSF releases that can be installed, which means Mac and Windows installations, and exclude things like building from source, pre-installed on OS, alternative implementation, and so on. :) I know of no implementation, standard or otherwise, that includes alternative GUI toolkits like pyqt/etc., so Tkinter has that edge on portability.
wow so many fucking downvotes, please respond to my evidence instead of supresssing my post.
This has a simple dynamic programming solution that takes O(n*t) time and O(n) space, where n is the length of the price list, and t is the target. Interview problems like these fall into the category of Competitive Programming problems. I suggest you read up on that subject.
Also look up SIMD, single instruction multiple data. Graphics Coprocessors are a major example of SIMD and vectorized architecture. They're often given a whole program of instructions and then told to run that program across many simplified cores. For example a physics calculation across millions of particles, or a lighting calculation across millions of pixels.

Thats a pretty distilled article on something I was grappling with recently. I like it! I was wondering though you talk about covariance matrices for linear transforms, can you do the same for systems of linear equations? So if I have MX = Y, where M is a matrix and X and Y are vectors, Does it make sense to calculate a covariance matrix of M to see how correlated the coefficients in M are? cheers bob

Can I use PyQt5 for apps for XP?
Thank you for your reply and several paths as options to take. 1- I am able to run "REQUESTS" which is a python module and extract only up to 2000 records for MessageTrace showing all details about the email logs. But I don't know why I am only getting up to 2000 records only. 2- using Powershell is possible but, I would prefer to to use python since I will be using it for an application and need to make sure that all steps are done in python. 3-I will definitely look for O365/Python APIs, but so far not much luck. 4-Maybe I should engage with MSFT directly and have them find a solution. I am pretty sure this problem has been asked before or has been attempted and most likely been solved. Thank you and I look forward to more answers. 
"Is mayonnaise a Boolean?"
Okay, hot take: if you feel like you HAVE to use any of the main Python UI packages then you should really just take a step back and figure out whether it'd be okay to make the people you're delivering the software to use CLI arguments. Even something like "use a CSV file with &lt;xyz.csv&gt; name as a config file and then load that in using the CLI" may be preferable to hacking together a suboptimal GUI experience, depending on the ultimate end-user.
It is because these comments aren't constructive or productive, and your tone is unpleasant. What do you want from us? Why make this post? What do you hope to achieve with this? (I realise this may sound like I'm being rhetorical, but I'm genuinely asking.)
You'd have to have a job for several years, then ask your boss if it was possible to work remote. This works especially well if your spouse is moving and it's the only way they can keep you as an employee. But as the other guy mentioned, no one will hire remote for an entry level position. Otherwise they'd just hire someone else instead who can work on-site. Forget working remote, get the job first.

Never heard any good of Tk myself. I've only used Qt but want to learn to use kivy. I'm surprised that I haven't seen a comment mention it. It can be used to build mobile GUI aswell.

Oh, that makes sense. 
I think the idea is that if you generate the identifiers randomly, it's less likely for others to find out which urls have already been shortened. For example someone could write a script that enumerates the alphabet (starting with a and going until they stop getting any results) to get the full list of urls your web app has shortened.

&gt; There are total 5 modules available in python to communicate with MySQL and provides MySQL database support to our applications SQLAlchemy?
Thanks for the guide Wil check it out
I found it useful for its depth, but didn't want an ORM.
Yes you are right. but i have included only the libraries not ORM. SQLAlchemy internally uses these 
Then don't. The only time I actually use the ORM is to create/alter schema and the interface for doing so is very clean and readable. I should note though that I primarily use SQL for data analytics - being able to quickly get up and running with a schema is nice.

It is used in countless applications used internally by organizations. I have seen it mostly in technical applications used in hardware labs, but I am sure there are many others. The benefit of just working with the “batteries included” core distribution outweigh the aesthetics. 
Using tkinter to make a small tool for my client. It looks like garbage, but it was fast, easy to build, and small. Works great for my requirements (they don't care how it looks so long as it is simple). I know PyQt is much more robust and I would consider it "better", but I don't know as much about it from a development standpoint. 
Your question about “mainstream applications” misses some of the most valuable software in the world - the in-house code used internally by organizations that collectively do trillions of dollars of business assisted by this software. 
It's way better ditch MySQL unless you work at a Telecom like me and your company wants to pay Oracle a licensing fee for everything.
I don't think using SQLAlchemy requires using the ORM features
It uses the comment style, though, in case you were (and I presume this because migrating to Py3) using the function signature style. Doubt it would be too difficult to modify, though, because Python allows direct inspection into the AST via a standard library module.
Yeah, we did it using regular expressions though. When we discovered we can write our own 2to3 transformers it was too late.

[Qt for Python](https://wiki.qt.io/PySide2). It's now getting official support. Qt is regarded by many as the best GUI toolkit. Even projects like LXDE are migrating *from* Gtk to Qt. There's of course debate and every toolkit has its advantages but Qt: 1. Is used by a lot of projects (including big commercial projects). 1. Is truly cross-platform in a way Gtk isn't. 1. Has more widgets and more flexible styling than tkinter. 1. Is fast and relatively memory efficient. 1. Is well-maintained with excellent documentation. I'd say unless you know you want to make gnome apps, Qt for Python is the obvious choice.
It's pretty standard to do. If it is an important update (security), some even don't allow the user to run the tool.
Your evidence is simply "I don't like the documentation format". It's a perfectly fine format. You have an opinion. Everyone else is okay with the format. I find it more detailed than it needs to be, personally.
Working on improving this script https://github.com/NasreddineBencherchali/Encoder-Decoder
&gt; an entry level position that could (one day) go remote. the point is - in all realistic likelihood, there's no such thing !
&gt; regex You poor, poor soul. For the same reason regex shouldn't be used on HTML, it shouldn't on any language.
I mean, that makes sense. I just imagine most people would edit these using something like Inkscape, especially when they're making complex graphics, right?
So, every time I run your tool on a container within a private LAN with no internet, your tool will try to reach the internet and either hang indefinitely, or hang until your arbitrary timeout is reached. No thanks, fuck off.
As far as I know, yes.

You are correct! :)
The code that I was referring to has both a CLI and a GUI. It's a lot easier to select a path with a file browser..
You can make any native-esque UI using Qt; it'll look the same as a C++ app in Qt. You can make any web UI that phones-home to a python backend using React. If you want something truly custom, I believe there are SDL libs for Python.
Welp, maybe "best GUI" was not the right title... But you got the point.
mysql-connector-python is by far the poorest MySQL driver right now. worse than using the now-defunct python-mysql. PyMySQL and mysqlclient, both by the same author, are excellent. For example: [here is an active memory leak in mysql-connector-python I have confirmed and is likely in its C extension code](https://bitbucket.org/zzzeek/sqlalchemy/issues/4296/memory-leak-in-large-table-insertion#comment-46511362). Other examples of problems I've had with this driver are listed at: http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/dialects/mysql.html#current-issues Background: I wrote SQLAlchemy. Suggest this blog post be rewritten against pymysql or mysqlclient. 
I think you missed some formatting pasting that, but here's what I think you want to know: def add_or_append(dictionary, key, value): if key not in dictionary: dictionary[key] = [] dictionary[key].append(value) Then: foobar = {} add_or_append(foobar, 'spam', 'eggs') # foobar is {'spam': ['eggs']} add_or_append(foobar, 'spam', 'cheese') # foobar is {'spam': ['eggs', 'cheese']} add_or_append(foobar, 'shirt', 'pants') # foobar is {'shirt': ['pants'], 'spam': ['eggs', 'cheese']} 
Auto generate marshmallow schemas from JSON. We have a lot of REST APIs that return JSON writing out marshmallow schemas by hand is tedious. 
You could also just use a defaultdict so that you don't need to check if the key exists. 
Heh. I've been using this pattern for a long time and it never occurred to me to use `defaultdict`. You whipper-snappers and your cutting edge Python 2.5 tricks.

Qt is great for making UIs. [Here's](https://github.com/further-reading/Dicecord/) a character sheet app I made in Qt last year. I found some tutorials here and there but TBH I've learnt so much more by just looking at the Qt and PyQt5 docs as I put stuff together.

Not sure if it addresses exactly what you're looking for, but I know Kong is a decent API gateway. Might give that a look
I'd be interested in this also.
The article's font is Helvetica, looks good to me. Are you on mobile?
SQLAlchemy cannot be also used without ORM. Anyway, in the beginning of the article, you stated the goal is teach "how to integrate Python applications with MySQL database server". And for this, SQLAlchemy is just a best library to do that. In my opinion, it should be listed as the first choice.

Is "regex" a library I haven't heard of? Because it sounds like you're using the `re` module from the standard library. My thoughts: extract all of the parameters together in one big named group, and then iterate over the matches of single parameters in that string.
It’s a bit much for most web dev, but I think “insane” is overselling it. Try the tutorial, it’s not all that bad. 
post your dockerfile, it's probably wrong
that's pretty neat. Python has so many amazing tools that are so simple. It's great
Yes, regex is a separate one. It's apparently a superset of re. I think you are correct on my next course of action.

Like I said, if I just copy my pipfile in first (like the gist does with requirements.txt) then the `pipenv install` will fail because the pipfile references local directories that haven't yet been copied in. I can copy those directories in as well, but that means I still have to do a full pipenv install every time something in those directories changes.

Looked through some Django stuff and found [Oscar](http://oscarcommerce.com/). Might be enough to get you started, it has a lot of stuff I think you're looking for. There are more options, this just looked like it might fit the bill for you.
You can use pyautogui sample code looks like this ``` pyautogui.moveTo(1420, 840) pyautogui.click() ```
If you're very comfortable with HTML/CSS/JS then I might recommend [Eel](https://github.com/ChrisKnott/Eel). Practically it serves a website that will open a browser to be used as your GUI. There is functionality for JS to talk to Python and Python to talk to JS in the browser. If you are interested I did a small written tutorial [here](https://nitratine.net/python-gui-using-chrome/). It might be a bit advanced at first but if you are familiar with HTML/CSS/JS then it makes things easier in the long run. Although if you want something a little closer to home, I recommend Qt, it has never let me down.
I second this, easy to learn, has a designer and there are a LOT of tutorials out there.
I picked up django in like 3 days. Perhaps try reading the docs first? Very good docs. If you can't learn django you probabbly arent ready to program alone.
[Ah, this one?](https://pypi.org/project/regex/) (It's generally a good idea to provide a link to any dependencies you're using outside of the standard library, that provides some context.) `matchobject.captures(n)` might actually be useful in your situation.
I agree. Some people’s jobs suck.

Developing a full email client application that's simple, and takes very little effort to navigate or complete common tasks.
Are you sure? The 2 links I mentioned explicitly states that its a command line interface tool.. `firefli-iii` that /u/Qniken mentioned also looks very cool.
The one killer feature Pg has over MySQL is built in full text search.
Given the degree of questions you're asking here, I'd highly encourage you to hire a programmer or use an existing service instead of rolling your own with any framework. The frameworks won't protect you in terms of security, and if you're finding Django hard to learn, I seriously doubt you're going to be able to handle financial security. Your site should just call out to a service that handles the payments like PayPal, gumroad etc... Don't do it yourself.

If you are about to learn, I'd recommend you check [PySide2](https://wiki.qt.io/PySide2) first (qt for python) instead of PyQt, as that is the official Qt bindings for python.
Pyside2. This is a silly example of how easily you can modify themes with styles on the fly: [Video](https://youtu.be/-TRAHa-hhPs)
A map generator - with random 2D functions and will generate terrain maps for a game that I'm writing.
Yes thank you for commenting. I tried Spyder today, and yeah its there. May be useful to plot on small dataframes but huge ones. I don't think anything can surpass MATLAB at that now. 
Library suggestion apart, the industry employs numerous professional to do exactly that, with a lot more data/computing resource than you have.
Visual Studio is absolutely one of my most favorite IDE. I use all the time w/ C#. Like you said its absolutely a very matured IDE. But from a scientific computation standpoint it is not something that offers great flexibility like plots etc.
We use pipenv for reproducible builds.
&gt; I am lacking something like an extra checkbox or maybe a slider for a some parameter for a small need as this one, ge for a small tool, go for Tkinter. Going for PyQt would be overkill.
Sorry about that. I got just got it using my Manjaro package manager. I wasn't sure where the official web page was.
To be honest? I only saw the second link, but that only says it can be launched from the command line. I'll have a look at the first one.
Thanks, I'll check out PySide2!
Or indent the block and preface it with "if 0:" You can toggle it back on by changing the 0 to 1.
Yup. This. The docs for Django are so good you don’t need anything else. If reading the docs is too much you need more experience. What few issues I’ve come across can be sorted out by directly debugging the source code. 
More insane learning curve than designing and building your own role-based auth system from scratch? I’ve never used Django, but “this framework seems complicated so I will implement everything from scratch” probably isn’t the most efficient approach.
*Name of The Wind* by Patrick Rothfuss. I'd recommend that book to anybody regardless of what programming language they're learning. Have you checked out /r/learnpython?
Python Crash Course is what I used and it was really thorough with syntax and how to apply what you've learned. I hear that Automating the Boring Stuff with Python is good too, but it focus' more on small projects.
You're not returning a value from your function. So when you give it n, it's accepting it and working with it, but not giving the changes back. You need to return the value. Also your code inside the function should just be ``` while n&lt;=1: n = n//2 print (n%2) ``` That's much more efficient and simple than recursively calling the same function. For the future, I also recommend posting to /r/LearnPython 
I see, thanks for sharing.
As part of a new habit I've started creating a series of blog posts on important and awesome Python features, including object oriented programming, properties, function annotations, duck typing, etc. Since I was bored by the usual tutorial examples, I looked for a topic that would make it fun to study and implement the concepts. And since I absolutely love Harry Potter, I started creating a whole Harry Potter universe around the topics. Originally, the project was not intended to become something like a tutorial. But as many of my friends loved the idea and found the code helpful I decided to create blog posts around it and share the work with the community. So if you like Harry Potter and want to improve your Python knowledge and skills (and maybe also your Harry Potter knowledge) you might find the project helpful, too. Happy coding!
You can also use setdefault in a regular dict X = mydict.setdefault("key", []) X.append(new_value)
please tell me more. why do you hate this, i'm going to start a new job where this will be my job. what did i do.... 
Good luck with that.
Nice work! If you ask me: get rid of all the explanation about the hundred days thing and focus on the Harry Potter themed examples. Those are really cool!!
If my company can figure out how to pay Oracle more money I promise they will figure it out. At this point I wouldn't be surprised if we had a team dedicated to that goal.
Wow! Fun read for both Python and Harry Potter enthusiasts alike
Just started coding on codecademy. Those blogposts helped me to get a better understanding of what I've been doing so far. And the Harry Potter setting makes it easy to follow unlike some of the conventional Python books... Looking forward to more content - maybe a Quidditch function? :)
It's *not* the most challenging since I wrote it, but the [solver program](https://github.com/rzzzwilson/Random-Stuff/wiki/puzzle-solver) was my first major win in python and convinced me that python was worth using. This was somewhere in the early 2000s. The code [is here](https://github.com/rzzzwilson/Random-Stuff/tree/master/solver).
That is a really impressive project; even more impressive is the year it was originally written! I took a look at some of your other projects in that repo, and enjoyed looking at them. I hope to see more random projects in the future if you still work on them!
Yeah, it is called PostgreSQL :D
I'm also using SQLAlchemy. Good job there!
"Is python dead with"? No; I was being facetious. \&gt; Is python dead? "No, go learn it." Even a cursory understanding of the python governance structure would allow you to arrive at the conclusion that python will be around for a very long time to come. The community is too wide and too deep.

Well, if you know that your machines should reply on a specific port, that would greatly simplify the task. Other than that, you'd have to look at the interfaces that are active on your machine, figure out which one serves your network (on Linux this information would be provided by `ip` kernel module, which has a frontend program called `ip`, for example, `ip a` will give you the list of interfaces, including the masks, broadcast addresses and some statistic info on packet delivery). The above would give you the IP address of your machine in the network in a CIDR form, something like 192.168.0.1/8 for example, meaning that all addresses in range [192.168.0.0, 192.168.0.0 + 2^8] are possible in this network. You will then have to check each such address individually. Here, if you know the port you want to connect, you'd only have to make 2^8, but if you don't know the port, then it's 2^8 * 2^16 (2^16 is the maximum port number). Since Python won't be able to do this in parallel... and there are only so many connections you can try to create at once, even if you could do this in parallel, this is going to take a lot of time...
There isn't really a way to get a reproducible build if you are using Docker. `pip` is going to be the least of your problems if you are going down that route.
There's Maria db, which is a drop-in replacement fro MySQL
All that's missing is a British voice over on all the lessons! :D
MySQL has more resources and help available for it and I'm very novice at databases.
Also true but that doesn't stop PostgreSQL from being better than MySQL as a technology and an interface.
Awesome! Thank you! Finally, I seem to understand object oriented programming!
&gt; Well, if you know that your machines should reply on a specific port, that would greatly simplify the task. ARP request is mandatory to work across all devices. 
Micropython is a version of python meant for microcontrollers. So instead of programming them in assembly, c, or c++, you can use the port of python. Recently (last two years give or take, and from my limited point of view) it's really taken off and matured. It use to be seen a toy that didn't work on many architectures (I'll acknowledge it was not a toy to the developers, but a lot of embedded programmers thought it would be either impossible or pointless to port python that way) and was almost too large to be useful for the chips it did work on. Since then it's been optimized, and had the number of chips it works on increase significantly. Really it's an amazing project and I'm glad it is still growing 
So I have a couple raspberry pis running socket servers, and I'm trying to generate a list of them on my computer. My plan was to get a list of all the devices on the wifi, ping them all, and then the pis I've set up would reply back with a unique code. So I can specify the port on my pis, but not for any other devices that might be on the network. Is there a python package that does what you described?
Why?
I make a program called qr-filetransfer which would let you transfer files from your computer to you phone over WiFi using a QR Code. The reason it was challenging was because I had to use many modules which I was unfamiliar with like `signal`, `socketserver`, and `signal`. But I always learn new things when working on a project. GitHub - [qr-filetransfer](https://github.com/sdushantha/qr-filetransfer)
Nice, I'm learning and (maybe) soon teaching Python, definitely gonna look through that :)
I guess he prefers saying sequel instead of ess-que-el. Sequel alchemy sounds better than ess-que-el-chemy 
Why can't it be done partially in parallel? Given that the network wait time will be non-trivial each thread would block on the network.
If you don't find a package, look into just using an existing utility. Fork and run the ARP scan utility and then ingest the input from it. Every Linux distro has ARP scan packages in their repos.
If you are about to ask a "how do I do this in python" question, please try r/learnpython
it's already in Python, I want some suggestions to improve this.
1) put your message inside input() chance = int(input("Select the multiplier of winning:" )) 2) use format() to format print()'s print ("You will only win if your number is less than or equals to {}.".format(win)) 
+1 for pyqt5. I actually do the exact same thing in a daily basis - simple ui with integrated matplotlib plots for dynamic plotting based on sliders and checkboxes. There are integration tutorials in matplotlib docs and stackoverflow that come to less than 100 loc.
Thank you so much, I was not aware of the first point. And for the second, is there any performance difference?
r/learnpython is still the best place to go for things like this, especially since you are a beginner
Consider making the code font size the same as regular text. It's currently very difficult to read.

Building a postal address parser, without a clean dataset and using NLP technics
Our [Housekeeper](https://gitlab.com/ModioAB/housekeeper) Not because the python code is difficult. It isn't, it's overall one of the simplest apps I've written as that. But because it's the result of months, and months, and months of tedious benchmarking, debugging, and improvements to our database structures, to make it come off in an integrated and automatic way. So, it's not the `python` part that's hard. It's everything else around it.
Cool. Makes me ponder the idea of doing something similar in my area. Useful to know the how the attendance rate correlates to the booking number. So that's about 42%. Did you charge people for tickets or was it pay-on-arrival or something else? +1 for vegan food
&gt; web scraping the SEC website (multiple tables, multi-line headers, inconsistent formatting etc.) What kind of info are you scraping? I've seen multiple people mentioning this but couldnt figure out how people are using the data. 
Oh yo! That reminds me so much of [claudiodangelis/qr-filetransfer](https://github.com/claudiodangelis/qr-filetransfer) written in GO.
No. We figured asking for money would even lower the attendance rate
I almost finished the course 'convolutional neural networks (CNN's)' on Coursera, which is a very nice introduction to building neural networks for image classification using tensorflow/Keras in python. I now want to train my own CNN using some image dataset from Kaggle. Through /r/datacience I found [this fun pokemon data set](https://www.kaggle.com/thedagger/pokemon-generation-one) that I'm going to use.
/r/learnpython would be the best place for questions like this.
While this is true, it may not be very meaningful for OP. I.e. most of the time you want to know not just that a machine is connected to the network, but that it is also able to do something. Eg. the Pi may be connected, but not have necessary programs installed on it, or only started ip module, but nothing else is functional yet etc.
In principle? Why, sure it could be. But, Python parallelism is so lame, that it just won't work well. My comment was about Python's ability to run in parallel, not about the plausibility of parallelization of this task.
Awesome tutorial ! There is this guy on view.ly . He has made a complete tutorial for [Pygame](https://view.ly/v/Q9a3BVuySpZ4), although I'd say it only really teaches the basics of Pygame.
Did you manage to cover your costs then? 
This is a tremendously useful contribution, especially for those who enjoy learning through analogy &amp; anecdote! Thanks!

Look at the front page of this sub, there's a sticky thread [What's everyone working on this week](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/93esip/whats_everyone_working_on_this_week/), and then the next 2 top posts are both on Python tutorials, clearly not news.

As for the tutorials on here right, I am inclined to agree somewhat that a python/mysql tutorial really isn't what I come here for; that's more on the moderators though
From the level of the content he is teaching I'm surprised he doesn't have an Indian accent.
Thanks, changed it!
Happy to hear that!
I agree, just changed it. Thanks for the feedback!
Haha, that's true!
I get what you're saying, and it's especially true for a large subreddit like r/python. It's just in contradiction to the fact the there's a [moderator stickied post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/93esip/whats_everyone_working_on_this_week/?utm_content=comments&amp;utm_medium=hot&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=Python) at the top of the sub asking what people are working on. If someone had said, hey you should post this to the dedicated sticky instead, that would make sense to me. But no, people here are essentially saying you're not good enough for this sub, go somewhere else. 
Seriously he does. 
Working on it right now: I receive a lot of (almost) formatted data from a tcp server (3rd party). Sometimes the data comes clean like: ID:title:timestamp:field1:field2....:fieldn! But sometimes it comes with special chars or space between lines and strings. I’m struggling to get all the data, make it clean and push to a database. Can someone help?

I liked his project so much that I just thought of making a python port of it XD
It depends, for the "[self.pet](https://self.pet)" variable it makes sense since an error would raised otherwise. For the '[self.house](https://self.house)' variable it's not needed. I removed it, thanks for pointing it out!
The character sheet looks pretty great; the style definitely looks like it could be used for professional apps with no one batting an eye, and it looks a hell of a lot better than the monstrosity I made in Tkinter.
This is great. Thanks for sharing. You might want to cross post this over to r/learnpython
I understand what this subreddit is *trying* to be as clearly shown in the sidebar. I'm just saying what it actually is is a bunch of reaction memes, personal projects, and tutorials with some python news sprinkled in there. I'm just trying to point out this double standard and how it can be a mixed message. 
Yep... well it's the nature of the beast. Reddit is rarely good for the real in-depth scientific/technical collaboration given the age group of the twats wasting their time here as opposed to mailing lists where all the magic actually happens.

Thank you so much. How about if I enable pinch to zoom, so that you could make the text smaller? 
Day 4: Since our other classes inherit all methods from the parent class we don’t have to implement the __repr__ method again for the other classes. But we want the output of __repr__ to be as unambiguous as possible. So we will add separate __repr__ methods to ensure that we use all information we have about the objects. (not sure why it pasted like that!) What if you want to output the \_\_repr\_\_ from the parent class and append additional info specific to the child class?
Thanks to your nudge, I think I now fully grasp that the actual problem to solve is much more general (i.e. runtime type-checks of function calls derived from static type annotations), and that JSON deserialization is just one instance of it. I updated the library and the \`README.md\` accordingly. Also I implemented the decorator thing, which I really find very convenient to use. If you find the time for it, I would be very happy to hear your feedback on the changes.
Nice video and whatnot. Thanks for sharing and whatnot!

Tablib has a way to load json into a dataset and then output that dataset in various formats including html. Not sure how it would handle nested tables but you might want to take a look. Pandas is fine also but I don’t think it can help you with formatting. 
`return repr(super()) + 'additional stuff'` although I wouldn't recommend doing that. Doing that with the `__str__` would be fine but the `__repr__` should be reserved for displaying the current object, usually how the current object can be recreated.

My friend and I have been looking for a place to scrape NFL/fantasy data. I tried several sites and packages but they were either no longer updated/supported, data was updated at end of the season, or it cost money.

Do you mean 192.168.0.0/16? /8 means only the first ocet is used and the only open /8 is 10.0.0.0/8. As for parallelism, this would be almost strictly network IO, so it's totally doable with any of the parallelism solutions (threads, asyncio, multiprocessing, etc).

Between PyData, PyCon and all related gatherings, I wish there was some hub with all the videos, talks and papers because it's not always easy to go through all the material, or remember when each event takes place and where they were posted.
Ok there's a lot to unpack. 1. Its possible there us no 3.7 package yet so you can try with python 3.6 2. You probably mean pyqt tools not qtpy. It matters because qtpy is also a thing. 3. Qtpy IS actually the package you want to use bc it lets.you use.pyqt 4 or or pyside etc. 
Sure. I was guessing Python might be able to use the time blocked on network I/O, but maybe not.
Pyqt5 is completely fine especially you almost certainly dont care a out licensing right now. but you should use qtpy rp mask the differences.

To be honest I'm not sure what would work better, maybe something like a lightbulb? Linking simple to intuitive? Not sure, I'm not really a front-end person either so design isn't my strong point! Or even a cog might work; simple, basic etc. Just the Steam logo is quite iconic

At work, I'm moving code written in legacy Python over to Python. Machine learning, so we have plenty of pickles that are incompatible because joblib or unicode, but all the tests are finally passing, and pickles have been converted. Time to see if I can get everything to work seamlessly. If it works, I would like to remove Python 2 completely (eventually), and clean things up properly. Looking forward to 3.8 for PEPs 505 and 572.

Not that you'd have to of course, seeing as your already *have* python installed, but sometimes it's nice to put it in a convenient place.

Some scripts running on Raspberry Pi to supervise my crypto mining setup. Namely for a coin mined using a setup that involves an Android tablet communicating with an ASIC. If the mining software locks up, it automatically gets restarted.
I'm enough of a muppet to write scripts from the command line and use grep and be absolutely uninterested in the implementation language of grep. &gt;But you're not enough of a muppet to assume that grep is fast because Bash is fast, are you? No but as a developer who has to wear a lot of hats, I sometimes have to say "should we implement this project in Java or Python? Hm, if we use Python can we achieve the target ops/second? Oh, using Vibora, maybe I can. So my project begins ostensibly in Python. And maybe it's not fast enough so I also port pieces of it to Cython. But I don't care because I'm a polyglot developer who is still installing the application using pip and venv. And instead of saying my program is Python/Cython/C, I just say Python because who gives a shit?

If anything, open-source software has less security risks, because there’s more people working on the code and finding potential security loopholes.
That’s flawed logic, as just because a piece of software isn’t open-source doesn’t mean it’s source code can’t still be viewed using a decompiler (even if only partially). And to add to that, there’s still less people working on and examining your code, meaning it’s prone to more security risks.

That's an awesome idea! I will start working on that next week!
I see that you implented a function in the updater for each of the various f1 teams. This looks fine. Since each of these functions does a flavor of the same thing, any thoughts on creating a Team class? That way you could update if and when new teams enter the market for jobs, instead of writing essentially the same function by creating an instance of a class with all their relevant info.

No Django or Flask. Just plain CSS and HTML front-end to create a static webpage. An independent python script keeps updating the repository the site is served from.
Haha good luck. I doubt they hire drivers like that
Good suggestion. Flask is great!
Yeah. You should look into the JS directory of the client repository. The stickynav.js handles this thing. There are some JS frameworks that make it easier, but I did not want to include any external libraries. The code is simple, look through it. If you don't get something, please ask.
I did not use any tutorials tbh. Just googling where I got stuck. The most of the design is from the Skeleton boilerplate, I just modified it according to my wish. For the updater part, it is mostly web scraping. I suggest you read the documentation of Beautiful Soup 4, it is very good.

Did you follow any guide on how to do this?
Not really, just the standard documentation
The Colormath library can do this for Adobe86 and sRGB. https://python-colormath.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ If by chance you need some other more obscure RGB spaces, or need to choose specific rendering intents, you will have to use LCMS, which is a pain in the ass because you need use a library wrapper and do Ctype coding. 
This is how I would approach this: 1. Convert your JSON file into a list of tuples/lists/dicts and append them to a master list. 2. Create 2 functions, one for sending the data to API A and other for API B. 3. Iterate over your master list and flip a coin and perform function A or B. You can use the following code to achieve that. import random for item in master_list: if random.randint(0, 1) == 0: function_a(item) else: function_b(item)

Pillow can be used for this: [https://pillow.readthedocs.io/](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/) Unlike Colormath which /u/teilo mentions, which can be used for transforming individual colour values, Pillow is used for converting images from one profile to another. It offers fully colour managed image transformations by wrapping LittleCMS2 C library. I would also recommend it over Colormath for accurate colour value conversions from one profile to another, where rendering intent and correct gamut mapping are needed. Colormath in particular is not usable for CMYK transforms, which aren't possible to do accurately without using a specific ICC colour profile. Here's how you'd use it to transform an sRGB image to LAB using Pillow: from PIL import Image, ImageCms # Create input and output colour profiles. rgb_profile = ImageCms.createProfile(colorSpace='sRGB') lab_profile = ImageCms.createProfile(colorSpace='LAB') # Create a transform object from the input and output profiles rgb_to_lab_transform = ImageCms.buildTransform( inputProfile=rgb_profile, outputProfile=lab_profile, inMode='RGB', outMode='LAB' ) # Open the source image rgb_image = Image.open('rgb.tiff') # Create a new image by applying the transform object to the source image lab_image = ImageCms.applyTransform( im=rgb_image, transform=rgb_to_lab_transform ) # Save the new image lab_image.save('lab.tiff', format='TIFF') Some things to note: * ImageCms.createProfile is for creating one of the few simple 'builtin' profiles which LittleCMS 2 supports. The colorspace argument needs to be one of sRGB, LAB, or XYZ. For other colourspaces, you can open ICC profile files using ImageCms.getOpenProfile. * The inMode and outMode arguments of ImageCms.buildTransform are [Pillow pixel types, as listed here](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/handbook/concepts.html#concept-modes), and should match the profile type. * The format argument of Image.save can be any one of [the many formats Pillow supports](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/handbook/image-file-formats.html).

Well...it *is* a website for F1 jobs...
Pipenv's claims are fairy tale. But, that's a separate issue. Your major problem here is that Docker is, in principle, incapable of reproducible builds. The problem is: what happens when you do, say: from ubuntu run apt-get update # Do other things Well, depends on how you build it: you may specify that you want Docker to cache the builds. And then they will be faster, but, eventually, even if you run all builds on the same machine, eventually, you will start seeing something like this: the content of layers that come after `apt-get update` assumes that something else was installed, rather than what is actually installed in this image. This is because someone else built an image based on this one and pushed it to your registry, but for her, `apt-get install` did something different from what it did for you. And if you are not caching layers, then every time you do `apt-get install` or anything like it, you are rolling the dice. Docker is not a packaging tool. It does go half way, but it's just not. If you want a packaging tool, use Deb, RPM, even MSI.
Aha! I actually encountered that exact bug the other day. It's an [open issue](https://github.com/ContinuumIO/anaconda-issues/issues/5006) with anaconda where the LittleCMS 2 dependency which ImageCms uses isn't being included on Windows. If you install python from pip rather than through conda, that should do it. One option would be to create a new conda environment, and then install Pillow via pip, and any other dependencies you need via either conda or pip. Here's the [documentation on creating a new conda environment](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html). To create an environment called colourfuntimes, you would run in the command line: * conda create -n colourfuntimes python=3 * activate colourfuntimes * pip install pillow That would mean you wouldn't be using the anaconda environment with all it's pre-installed libraries anymore, and wouldn't have spyder installed in the new environment. You could alternatively uninstall pillow from the anaconda environment, and then reinstall it from PIP. This would let you keep using Spyder as part of anaconda and not worry about setting up a new environment. Because pillow is part of the anaconda distribution though, removing it also uninstall the 'anaconda' package. All the various libraries which make up anaconda stay installed, but the parent package which lets you update to new versions of anaconda would be removed. If you aren't concerned about that, uninstalling pillow with 'conda uninstall pillow' and then installing it with pip with 'pip install pillow' would be the simplest way to get it working.
You made my day.. respect... would u like to share some utube tutes also woth us ? thanks..
Eh I'm not on YT sorry
Yup, that's what should happen. RGB and LAB are different ways of representing colour, so how the colours are encoded in the image is different. But the image itself should appear as close as possible to the original.
Well, I downloaded Python 3 and IntelliJ IDEA CE. I’m cruising through a Udemy course here and there. 
ah yes the irony of being a professional developer. Nothing says success like the programmer who renders himself/herself obsolete.

you can reasonably expect any module that advertises python 3 compatibility to support 3.7 as well; there should not be any breaking changes relative to python 3.6. there are subtle cases in which modules *can* stop working with 3.7, but those are exotic, often fixed easily, and would usually show warnings already in python 3.6.
&gt; I wish there was some hub with all the videos Like https://pyvideo.org/ ?
There's no way to do this. When debugging, I just print out the values of txt, globals, and locals in [dataclasses.py](https://dataclasses.py) \_create\_fn, at about line 356 (right before the exec call). You should open a feature request on Python's bug tracker. I'm open to suggestions on what the interface to this feature would look like (maybe a parameter to @dataclass? maybe create a new class attribute with the per-function source code?). Note that in 3.7, this feature was removed from namedtuple. I think that was for performance reasons.
Would it be practical to automate fundamental analysis? Have a program crawl through 10ks on sec.gov (or wherever), run the data through a proper DCF model, and then spit out an NPV based on the rules you set?
Nice
you're not supposed to run `apt update` inside a docker container. They're reproducible because you build a base layer and build off of that. 
So it's important to know that python 3 is backwards compatabile that means a package built on 3.4 should work on 3.7. It is possible that a package may break, but it is highly unlikely. The reverse is not always true. A package built with 3.7 might not run on 3.4. This isn't usually a problem but it is when new language features are used like the assignment operation. So remember, there is backwards compatability but not forwards compatability. 
For me, Telegram has been the most pleasant chat bot dev experience so far. I go for Django + Telepot + Celery Worked on this not too long ago (t.me/breed_identifier_bot)
Lots of packages broke because of the async keyword change: https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=902788
Qiime2 wouldn’t work with 3.6 so I’ve been waiting for the 3.7 release. I tried installing some packages with a 3.7 environment and a few standard ones weren’t compatible . I will try to get a list together

It loads very fast, imagine how todays Internet would look like without all this bloatware on The websites (tracking, analytics, ads, etc.)
I don't use NLP techniques with this one, instead I have predefined commands and answers with this one. The core functionality is based on Image recognition (identify breed of a dog). Celery is used for async tasks (the identification itself), Django for the routing and database work (storing name + language pairs). There is a lot more going on, but I don't think it's relevant to mention the rest of the stack. With NLP I have used Dialogflow and it did okay for my small scope project. The alternative would be to try and tokenize the messages yourself (NLTK)
not quite true. notably, `async` is now a keyword which means any library that used the old `asyncio.async` function is dead
Feature suggestion: Auto-google the interwebs for salary estimate.
Makes sense. Sounds like a solid stack that will stand up to production volume use and scalable. 
I'm new, so I've been working on automating my grow space. I'm building a script to build a CSV file that will be uploaded to the physical module that controls 3 relays. The information is run over the course of a few months with each day having it's own set of parameters to stay in. I'm just trying to figure out the best way to make classes!
You're writing python, not java -- stop doing that please. Also, taking picture of code examples? What is this 1999? Please stop that too. Best suggestion im going to give you: Go to medium.com and literally STEAL their ux.
I like the tutorial so far after watching the first part. As you're looking for constructive criticism, I'm use a headset with a microphone close to your head, because the sound quality is quite bad and it would improve a lot with a headset. I'd also not use a copyrighted background image (Calvin &amp; Hobbed are nice, but that could at some point get you in trouble) 
Ah, are you going to use a SAT solver library for that, then?
Thank you! The code will be great to learn :)

Cool! I’m working on the same thing! It’ll be interesting when I’m done to compare and see where the methods diverged.
Thank you so much
&gt; even bitcoin code is open-source That is such a weird statement in this context… Short answer, btw: Government agencies are notoriously slow at everything. The private sector has only just begun understanding the value of open source in a big fashion. Expect government institutions to lag behind by the usual one to two decades.
Very interesting. Kudos for keeping it simple and straightforward. A quick question: Do you plan to introduce search functionality? For example, if someone wants to search for specific job title / keyword in all teams?
Although it doesn't hurt to have it, the number of jobs are so small that browser based search should work just fine
May I ask you why you don't embed the content of stickynav.js in the main page? It's so small, to me it doesn't worth loading and additional file for just a tiny function
What an absolute beautiful design. Good work!
Well I did that to maintain a clear structure. But your point is also valid. I'll run some performance metrics to determine if the performance hit is significant enough to make the change.
Thank you
Raymond hettinger had a talk at pycon 2018 where he talks about the code generated. I can't find a link to it but he have some website for the talk. Here is the link. Hopefully it help you https://youtu.be/T-TwcmT6Rcw
You don't know how happy I am about it :) How will I know about it? 
cool. I will totally check that out. !remind me 12 hours
Check your logs. Was the first user DRicciardo?
Thanks. I realised the sound quality was bad once it had been recorded. Will work on fixing that the next time around. Will change the background then. Never thought of the copyright issues.
Learn python syntax.
No not to start off. I'm just going to check each cell individually, and then check it's neighbours. I already have a working program, and it works fine. I might try to explore more advanced concepts once this project reaches a stage where it can solve the game.
Awesome. Look forward to that.

What do you mean -- an African or European Pythran?
For the background you might want to do one that has your youtube channel name / twitter handle and such in it, so that it's visible most of the time. This might help people remembering your name better... 
It would be helpful to function by discipline. I'm not interested in a social media manager job but I may be interested in Simulation Engineering jobs on multiple teams.
Great project, thanks for sharing. I'm really liking how you handled cookies, it's very instructive.
Isn't `pythonw` the headless (without terminal) python interpreter? Also, you don't open `pyrhon` to write your ycode, you write it in an editor.
Haha, yeah I've heard coworkers talk about this, I'm pretty excited if that could happen... But between outlook/windows/python/and daily software updates, someone is going to need to update often. 
The lack of robustness is fine for me. I'm looking at it as an instructive tool for handling cookies in python. Cheers!
Why not use one of sympy's built in [solvers](http://docs.sympy.org/latest/modules/solvers/solvers.html)?

I would just like to add something regarding the chapter "Defining Schema in SQLAlchemy Core". I personally found it more straightforward to define the table in a mysql gui client (like HeidiSQL for example), and then generate a model source code for it via the "sqlacodegen" command line tool. That way, most of the work described in that chapter can be omitted.
Is this article translated or generated by a bot?
Rather than using sublime text, the easiest way is probably using IDLE (a python IDE), which will be included when you download python from [python.org](python.org) 
Thank you!
Implemnting xyzzy cheat would be funny too.
I heard there's an opening at RBR at the moment. Their actively looking for a new hire from outside the company. You'll probably have a shot.

Doesn't Sage already do that? I don't know, I've ever used Maxyma, but it seems like the very basic thing to do for symbolic math program.
Thanks for the pointer.
Cool video. Thanks for adding another resource to learn from online 
In Python, this is called a "closure". After you read some tutorial material about closures, you can redo this article and make your examples more meaningful. Your Linux/Windows execute example is pretty lame considering all you do is return a function that branches on the system type. A better example would be to return methods that actually did OS-specific things ("dir" vs. "ls", for instance).
It would be fine if the source code were dynamically generated when requested to avoid any added class overhead. I will open an issue on this. Thanks for the pointer. Bob
The way to assess security risks is to have your program audited. Whether the programs source is available to general public or not will not have a lot of meaning in this debate. One can claim that open-source programs are less likely to be vulnerable because more people had access to the source and could verify it for themselves. But, very few people have the necessary skills to perform such an assessment. So, the numbers won't matter that much. A lot of open-source programs are used in enterprise world and do pass security checks. So, people who claim the opposite simply don't know what they are talking about. If you want an upper hand in this debate, ask them for a specific task, where you want to use an open-source program and find one that did pass security audit.
I wish you good luck in your search 😊
referer should be put in headers 
This is a content-free article which is really just spam for their training courses.
hi , i didn't get it. can you give an example please?
If you have to run existing legacy python2 code, use python2 (especially if it's code you didn't write and/or don't understand). If you are writing something new today, it would be **idiotic** to use anything other than python3 
Gitgud bro
Makes sense
It entirely depends on what libraries you are using. Python 2.x is going to be discontinued eventually (2020 was the last date given). Most libraries should be available in Python 2 and 3. Taking a look at the book you are talking about, I'm guessing that it uses Numpy, Pandas, SKLearn and Scikit in general. All of those libraries are available to use in Python 3. It also looks like the book in general is about implementing stuff from scratch so I really don't see how the different python version should affect it apart from the division differences. You can fix that by just starting your scripts with: from __future__ import division # Your script The [github](https://github.com/joelgrus/data-science-from-scratch) looks like it even has python 3 code samples too. So, just stick to python3.7 imo.
Ah i thought Python IDLE was acctualy pythonw, doesn't the editor come together with the installation of Python? I have Monodevelop but not sure if that is compatible with python 
OP, it is hard to give advice to fix things like "none of my code is working". At least paste the error output. &gt; "the data science community is firmly stuck on 2.7" No, that sentence is not correct.
Thanks so much for the quick responses you guys! \-Newbie
Are you just clicking on pythonw.exe? My shortcut has an argument: C:\Python3\pythonw.exe "C:\Python3\Lib\idlelib\idle.pyw". Otherwise try a fresh install.
exactly
On what path? Python is in **C:\\Users\\User\\Python37\\** My projects is in **C:\\Users\\BakeA\\Python37\\Python Crash Course\\** Do you want me to put all my projects directly in the python folder? Because that seems pretty counterintuitive. If I'm in **C:\\Users\\BakeA\\Python37\\Python Crash Course\\** in cmd then whenever I type python it comes up as not recognizable. I've googled a lot but can't figure out what the hell is going on lol
**PATH (variable)** PATH is an environment variable on Unix-like operating systems, DOS, OS/2, and Microsoft Windows, specifying a set of directories where executable programs are located. In general, each executing process or user session has its own PATH setting. *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Python/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28
No, you can put the projects anywhere, what you need to make sure is that the python executable is located on your PATH. if you Google "add python to PATH" you should be able to find instructions on how to check if it's there and add it if it's not. Also, avoid having spaces in folder names. I know Windows lets you do it but it causes problems if you try to use git or Github later.
your best bet would probably be to do some web dev using a python backend. small-medium companies use things like Django a lot and flask to make their own internal platforms and such so there is a demand for it. Networking and reaching out might be your best bet. A real position in data science would be pretty huge leap. 
IDLE comes with Python. But, as a lot of people would tell you, it's probably better you leave IDLE behind. Write you code in a plaintext editor (notepad, Atom, ...) and run it in the CMD with `python myfile.py`. And for the python shell just `python`.
Oh i had to search the idle.bat file which was kinda hidden, now i can open it thanks.
How foods you manage to do all that classes in 3-4 months.
The answer is having no social life and being single. 
Does the Monodevelop editor also work with Python? I use that one for C# and Javascript
Actually that makes sense, would be a good idea to get some practical experience! How long do internship usually go for in the field, is a few months matter or 1 year+
Is this seriously an article about comments? Ok look ... Import is debug = os.getenv('DEBUG', False) If debug_mode: # your code here You can go further and even use debug levels or use command line args instead of environment variables etc.
V true.

Not really, I am in a relationship and work 40h+ weeks. I've just been spending most of my spare time into it, reading on the bus in the mornings, at lunch breaks and some in the evenings. It's doable really, just need some motivation! I've been really enjoying it so that makes it way easier.
That's a little harsh but could be true
Summer internships are common, so a couple of months.
Laden, or unladen?
That’s my life for the past 7 months. Eat sleep python and Django. Been a hermit going hard on those two. Learned a lot but still need to keep studying. Ugh need to find a job ASAP 
[I just published my very first package!](https://github.com/Jasper-Koops/easy-gscv) When working with scikitlearn I found myself often repeating the steps of spitting the data and configuring the gridsearch / cross validation parameters, so I create a class that automates most of that work. Its scope is still relatively limited (classifiers only for now). Still, its kinda cool that you can just type in pip install easy-gscv and my package is installed
I'll have a look, thanks
You started programming 7 months ago? You feel like you're far off from being job ready?
&gt; What do you mean by saying Docker isn't Python aware? Docker rebuilds anytime it detects a change to any of the files that were copied into the container image, regardless of whether or not those files affect the outcome of a Python build. &gt; You don't need a virtual env inside a container, docket container IS a virtual environment in itself. Even if you have a lot of dependencies, those are cached for future, so first build might take 10 mins and the rest will take 1 min, for example. Just go for From python add . / pip install -r requirements.txt or something along these lines. I agree that I don't need a virtualenv. I'm not using a virtualenv (`pipenv install --system` installs dependencies to the system directories). I can't use `pip` because `pip` isn't deterministic, and the `COPY` statement needs to precede the `pipenv install` statement (see rationale in the original post), so `pipenv install` ends up rerunning with every container build.
At the GitHub page for this book, there are `code` and `code-python3` directories. The first is Py2.7, the second Py3. The author states that he is working on a new revision, which will use Python 3.6. Do not use Python 2, go directly to 3.
