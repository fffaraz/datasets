Python libraries are actually better used than left alone. Global seems really badly used as well. I understand your point of view, "Hei i coded it alone" but you will end up writing crazy sh\*t that will make cry most serious developers; &amp;#x200B; My best advice : Iterate on architecture rather than feature
I've written a bit of cython for work before. It is really awesome over writing your own extension in C because it is a mix of the two, and that mix is more of a spectrum. In the same file you can be doing pointer fiddling with strict types while utilizing it in another function that's half typed, half not, and another function that's pure python. You get some really fine grained control over how high level or low level your code is, whereas with pure C it is all pretty low level and with pure python its all high level. Another great benefit is that it understands libraries like numpy and scipy, and can use their C interfaces automatically without you having to do anything fiddly. You also get access to the standard libraries of both python and C, and get to combine them fairly seamlessly in the same code. Doing the equivalent in just a C extension would be very difficult, and would come with a high likelihood of getting it wrong. Doing the equivalent operations with the cpython api is not straightforward, yet its just python syntax when using cython.

True powerquery is better than traditional Excel but still lacks computing power compared to Python. I’d say powerquery is easier to build but not suitable for mega data, Python takes longer to build but scales better with large datasets.
Define exclusive.
That’s quite cool, could you explain how you did it or maybe you have a github. I’d really appreciate it.
I knew someone was gonna talk trash about my global LMAO I really don't mind trash talk it all you want but it works ;p
Yes, logically, a conditional statement is equivalent to a disjunction that includes a negated statement: for propositions ‘p and q’, p ⊃ q ≡ ~p v q ... ‘if p, then q, if and only if; not p or q. 
Trashtalk ? Which trashtalk ? You don't know how to write code. That shit is worse than what I wrote when I was 15 in C. &amp;#x200B; Now that's trash talk.
yea so it takes a screenshot of a few pixels in front of the dinosaur it then converts it to grey-scale (a bit easier for the computer to analyze the pixels for black ones) and if it has a certain number of black pixels, it jumps. im pretty new to programming so i dont really know what github is or what its for ive heard of it before sorry
LMAO chill out brotha I'm just joking around you don't need to take it so serious. All in saying is it works don't it? I'm happy that it works not that it's "politically correct code" lol
code is never good enough brooo ! On a more serious note, Global usually means you f*cked up something or don't understand something. Now if you want to stagnate that's really up to you, I won't stop suggesting good practice because some guys are happy with "it's working" ; Especially in /r/Python ; it is already not a good place to learn, I don't know why we should encourage these kind of practice. Now yeah, it's work !!!!! CONGRATzz BROOO
Do you know how to cross-compile Cython to ARMv7 within the setup.py file?
wtf
Because people implement things because they are based on papers that everyone has access to. SIFT/SURF are the most notable ones.
&gt;in short they are all integrated Integrated means that things are designed to work together. Adding a bunch of independent plugins to Vim manually really isn't integration so much as bolting on a bunch of disparate elements which may or may not cooperate. JetBrains had an article about this: &gt;While Vim is a great choice indeed, as soon as you try to use it &gt;for anything it wasn’t designed for, you run into problems. For &gt;example, if you use it as an IDE.... &gt;With Python, there is a real need to get rid of routine tasks &gt;and use supplementary tools like code inspections, error &gt;highlighting on the fly, dependency checks, quick-fixes, &gt;refactorings, a debugger, frameworks support, testing &gt;assistance, Version control, search and navigation, project &gt;management, remote development assistance, PEP-8 &gt;compliance checks. That’s quite a list. And all these features &gt;must work together in a reliable, efficient and robust fashion. &gt; &gt;That’s what IDEs are designed for. They provide the necessary &gt;level of efficiency and comfort for using many tools and &gt;features in one place. &gt; &gt;For better or worse, Vim is not an IDE. Sure, it is customizable &gt;and supports many things, with lots of plugins and add-ons and &gt;other bells and whistles. Yet it’s really far off from being a real &gt;IDE. It then goes on to show the cramped mess of an editing window one gets when adding all of these plugins to Vim. https://blog.jetbrains.com/pycharm/2013/06/vim-as-a-python-ide-or-python-ide-as-vim/
Yes, in this case the name "contents_of_file" only exists in the scope of read_text(). 
Ableton and Reaper both do. Lots of good materials out there for both.
cool thanks
Ableton has Python scripting? Might be enough to get me to switch from FL.
That's very easy to test: x = 100 if x &gt; 50: print "x &gt; 50" elif x &gt; 25: print "x &gt; 25" else: print "neither" What happens if you run this code? 
This reply was to the OP, they answered why it wasn't predicted to be a mouse in the following frame. So in a way, yes, it stopped being a mouse in the next frame, because the confidence rating dropped too low. It would be interesting if they implemented some kind of search function, where if something has been identified as a "mouse" in one frame, it will search for that object in the next frame, and accept the prediction even if the confidence level dropped, because they were confident enough before.
Maybe even train it on a dataset of sign language? That way, with some extra work, you could literally "tell" it to do things like taking a picture!

How far can it go?
it makes it to 700 points then the game changes to night mode and the background becomes black which sends my script crazy because it thinks cactuses are all over. it did however get all the way to 800 by jumping and ducking around like a maniac

Congratulations!
The nth row in Pascal's triangle contain the values possible for the combination function, n_C_r = C(n, r) = n! / (r!(n-r)!), where n is fixed and 0 &lt;= r &lt;= n. Hope that helps somehow.
Addendum: n must be &gt;= 0. Another way to build rows of Pascal's Triangle is to recursively start with a list containing [1, 1], then make a new list with just [1] and append to this list the neighbor-sums of the former list, then append a 1 at the end.
thx bby!
and i'm trying to figure out how to detect a simple black rectangle. this is truly amazing work
cool shit bro
...but can it tell if something is a hotdog? Very cool though!
As the bot has told you, these kinds of posts belong in /r/learnpython. 
You should make it when it detects so many black pixels, it replaces black detection with white detection
Git stores what are called repositories, which basically tracks what you've edited in your project (and as part of that, the current state of your project). By tracking edits instead of just the files, you can collaborate with other developers without nearly as many issues. Git*hub* is a site where people can upload and find repositories, to store them online, share with other people, and find collaborators. If you're looking to do this professionally, your github is a lot like an artists portfolio, and having one is pretty important. Learning git is a skill in and of itself, and it can be pretty overwhelming at first. But there's a lot of good tutorials, and the basic usage is pretty simple once you get the hang of it.

That's what I'm playing with this weekend. 
Check out the Wikipedia page for Pascal's triangle and the serpinski triangle
I think that this is very creative! It's definitely a great "Automate the Boring Stuff" example too. Maybe a future employer would find this fascinating too, yea? 
Keep at it! You've figured out a lot and created something cool and fun with it! Rock on!
It looks to me like you also get to pick and choose where you want to use it - you can optimise the critical bits and leave the rest just in Python - is that right? Because that would be way easier than having to do the entire thing in C.

Haven't done anything with python in at least three years. Planning on taking a look at ansible modules, maybe seeing if I can extend it's use with Cisco IOS. Also debated a few other things to try to get it to work with, but that's my main focus.
Nope, sure don't!
are you talking about code bullet? he used a completely different approach to this he used artificial intelligence to do it my program scans the pixels in front of the dinosaur
Thanks man lol. Look I'm not really a programmer I like to fiddle. Nothing serious. I actually DONT mind stagnating. Maybe that's why I'm so nonchalant about it. The fact that it's working at all makes me happy. I'm not against spaghetti code and bad use of global variables. I feel like they put the global variable in there, it works for what I'm using it for then I'mma use it lol. Thanks for the input, if I do really feel like truly getting better maybe I'll take you up on the offer. As it stands right now however, I'm happy ;)

This is amazing! Thanks for sharing it.
I go back and forth between pycharm and vs code. The only thing I don’t like about vs code is the tab complete sucks most of the time and running small bits of code is really slow.

So I’m pretty new to both coding and editors.

No problem! Ableton looks to be mainly remote scripts for controllers and what not, but Reaper is wide open. &amp;#x200B; After looking in to it a bit more, I think I'm gonna play around a bit with Reaper, see if I can make something cool.
I made an oopsie, I got impatient and tested what I put and it turns out I need to replace "if" with "while:" so the working code (I tested it and it works with python 3.6) is: `x=1` `while x == 1:` `*your code here*`
If you put a library in the include path of an unsupported runtime, the files are in the wrong place. Seems obvious.
thx bb

this is kinda bad
Always that one guy... On other hand... GREAT JOB MAN :)
Mind posting a screenshot of code or link your resources to figure this out? I’m working on a pixel game to learn python but this seems so cool ! 
*camera pans to show high quality mouse, keyboard, and monitor used to automate one of the most simple games on the internet* 😂 great job btw 
you could query from some pixels that never have an object go through them (I.e. there top of the game screen)
Nice work on the first project man. I can you please tell me how the program is detecting the obstacles? Like did you set an area for which it continuously read the screen?
nah fam i just wanted to show u i’m not pressing the keyboard, thanks😂😂
yea so basically i defined a small box in front of the dinosaur and it is constantly taking screenshots of that box, and if it detects any black pixels it jumps
Of course there is :) The main goal for Yolo is not for video. But why cant we test Yolo with video, right ?
Yes sir :)
It's pretty cool. Code please, I'm also a beginner and would love to learn how you did it.
Because Yolo was designed not for video. In other word, predictions for 2 consecutive frames are independant from each other
As long as we have suitable dataset, whatever is ok :)
Thank you
thank you :)
haha :)))
thank you :)
thank you sir :) If we add a set of photo for hotdot into the training set
thank you :)
That's fine that you don't like it. I didn't write it for you. I wrote it to eff around ;)
Hey man, the idea you used to automate it is pretty cool. 
But you posted it for me to see, and it was painful. I commented as such.
THX BRO
hmm i’m not sure what you mean, like what would the benefit be? right now i have it so it only scans certain pixels in front of the dinosaur 
Fair point. Well in any case, thanks for your comment. Have a good one
thanks bro
is that pycharm? How do you make games like that in pycharm? Sorry, new to coding. That’s Python as well? How does the visual part get built?
yes i programmed it in pycharm with python, i didn’t build any of the visual part it’s literally inside of the actual game on google chrome

If the top left is gray or is bought and you do the opposite logic, jump if the screen is white pixels instead of gray. This is very awesome, good work

If you download the GitHub Desktop client, you can 'Add a Local Repository' (your project folder) and publish it to GitHub for others to see.
I’ve been wanting todo this for ages, I’ve looked in a tons of places and asked on a multitude of forms. How did you make Python take a screenshot and “Play” the game? I understand the rest of the logic but I can’t find how to do those first two steps.
If you’re excited about, go for it! Do a little research to see how you can leverage what already exists, but your passion is the most important part. You can figure out how to differentiate from there. Worst case scenario you built something you can showcase and learned some stuff on the way. Best of luck 
Pretty sure codebullet did a video on this exact game already, have you seen that?
whole point of the game is so it's not on the internet :\^)
Pick a zone where it's always white or always black depending on the day/night cycle and make it so it switches between day/night mode accordingly
Just like Robocop!
That's a really impressive first project! Well done bud. 
Thank you. Was thinking of doing this this weekend. Would love to know **how**he did it but I guess that's just programming. Bang your head till the wall breaks or till your head does. 
I'm guessing here, but this is how I would do it quickly. Tell python to mimic the input device and have chrome in focus. So it isn't "talking" to chrome, it's sending the command "mouse click" or "spacebar click" to the computer in general and because chrome is in focus it responds as if you did it with the mouse or keyboard.
This is a \*detector\*, and not a \*tracker\*. And if you know the distinction between those then it's not strange at all. In this case the detections are on single images, which means that the detector (YOLO, in this case) has no memory of what it saw previously. &amp;#x200B; What you can do is attach a tracking system that takes the detections, and tracks them over time. The tracking algorithm can then remember that there was a "mouse" at a specific place, even if it's not detected for a few frames. That can also be used to make sure that a tracked object doesn't change category/class/label over time, e.g. if something has been detected as a "cat" for a long time, a single frame where it is detected as "dog" would not change the label.
Nice script ! You need to upload this on github :D
Is this Pytorch version faster than using Darknet? I use a GTX 1060 and am getting a speed of 0.07s on it using Darknet. (I'm using a YOLOv3-416 though.)

Ok, I don't know if this is common but I am just noticing a trend of me underestimating myself really hard. That was not nearly as hard as thought it would be. I thought you would have to do some voodoo magic to get it to work. Am I the only one that goes "there is no way you could do that, all you know are functions, loops and dictionaries"? 
Nice!!!

Just keep at it. You'll soon find that 95% of programming is not the coding part, instead it's the working out how you're going to tackle a problem in the first place. How this game's been automated is a great example. It could have been done a few ways, but grabbing a few key pixels and checking white is a nice pragmatic solution.
Thanks and I guess we did focus more on the logic on classes. Just me spit balling here but is one of the viable ways to intercept the first black pixels on the screen (objects from the right) and check the speed of the game to calculate when it should jump or is this the most efficient way? This way it can see multiple things when the game gets fast. Multiple trees andn birds. Instead of seeing 1 foot ahead, is it better to look 10 feet ahead? Or is this more work than necessary If it's not randomised then could one predict what the game will do next? Now I am more intrigued and have this urge to just try something.
Doesn't codebullet make a clone of the game and get the computer to learn not just logic based off of black pixels? 
CodeBullet did a video about this
I've played around with this before but couldn't it be done much better with the apple shortcuts app and then using some method of communication in there

First off, with a file this big use gists to show them off. But on to your code look into [type hinting](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/), get rid off comments that don’t tell you anything about the algorithm *#lists, #functions* they don’t tell anyone anything. Excuse the formatting of this comment mobile will be the death of me. 
Is this your own original project? I’ve seen the same project on YouTube before....
He copy pasted code from this tutorial https://youtu.be/bf_UOFFaHiY No credit given.
Don't you think it's a little dishonest of you [not to cite the code you copied?](https://youtu.be/bf_UOFFaHiY) 
That's pretty one! I'd love to know how you actually made it. Because I'm also in Python want to know more implementations of it.
I realise the title isn’t very informative but this is a nice overview of a few python features along with really solid use cases for why you’d want and ‘need’ to use them. It shows some of the philosophy of python and how that influences how the language is designed and how you can use it to your advantage.
welcome :) I guess you want to learn python so I would start with "how to exec python code and how to save your script".. just everything about how python works. after that you can start with data types, variables and operators. if statements, input and raw_input are essential for beginners. the rest basically happens by itself. so stay tuned and have fun :) 
Old video. Its there in freecodecamp channel too. Are you being a Karma whore? Title is also the same as video. Is a beginner stupid? If not, then post OP, not copy paste.
To make it more interesting, try to train a reinforcement learning model on it. Q-learning is quite simple to do.
That's pretty cool, thanks for sharing
I would write a def with that replaces the code in all the elif's. I think you can spare some llines there. &amp;#x200B; Something like: def register_def(fine_amount): finelist.append(fine_amount) print("${} FINE").format(fine_amount) &amp;#x200B; Maybe it is easier to check if, for example, the speedlimit is lower than 10 than to check if the value is in an array where all the numbers are lower than 10. In the following elif you check if it is below 15 than 20 and so on.
Are you sure its copy pasted?
exactly, and he uses DNN
Apparently. Welcome to the new /r/python where everyone is required to congratulate someone as long as they say they're a beginner, even when they don't deserve it. Kinda like a participation trophy.
This is uselessly vague. Try starting with google. If you get stuck and have specific questions, feel free to post your code and error to r/learnpython
It'd depend on the game. In this case, it only needs to see a few pixels ahead to jump. If there were patterns to learn and predict movements then you'd need to see farther. But the bare minimum seems appropriate here.
&gt;My FPS is a bit slow for real-time 
Check the two videos, both OP's and the youtube video. He didn't even bother to change the function names.
Opinions on this combo? Opinions on Briefcase specifically? &amp;#x200B;
You could just get rid of the lists and use the range function to replace that, and instead of using all those elifs you should use the switch statement. By eliminating list 'a' you could do something like: If CarOverLimit in range(1,10): Code here And likewise with other lists. The range function I wrote starts at 1 and ends at 9, excluding 10.
Yes, thats why I was trying to read them as well. Thanks for clarifying
My main feedback would be to try and reduce the if-elifs you have. Instead of a long line of if-elifs, try using lists or dictionaries instead For example, instead of storing each speed value separately, and then having the fines in your if-elif ladder, I would store the overspeed boundaries together with their fines, and then store the maximum fine in its own variable. Like so: INCREMENTAL_FINES = { 10: 30 15: 80 20: 120 25: 170 30: 230 35: 300 40: 400 45: 510 } MAXIMUM_FINE = 630 Then, I would define a function to get the correct fine give the overlimit speed value. The function below first checks to see if the overlimit is less than 0. Then if the overlimit is less than any of the speed values in our dictionary, we get the fine from the dictionary. Lastly, if the overlimit is not less than any of the speeds in the dictionary, it concludes that the overlimit is 45 or over and returns the maximum fine. def overlimiy_to_fine(overlimit): if overlimit &lt;= 0: return 0 # not speeding for boundary in INCREMENTAL_FINES: if overlimit &lt; boundary: return INCREMENTAL_FINES[boundary] # less than 45 over return MAXIMUM_FINE # 45 or higher Lastly, I define a function to print the fine: def print_fine(fine): if fine == 0: print('NO FINE') print(f'${fine} FINE') 
I tried to use VSCode for Python by still prefer PyCharm. For now i use VSCode only to edit openapi specs that are not really related to python but VSCode have good designer plugin for it ;) &amp;#x200B; All of my projects envs are based on docker and in PyCharm there is great integration with docker (I work mostly on web apps). As far as I know VSCode does not support python envs on docker yet (ssh interpreters are supported) and even if you can manually use it, it will not be as smooth as in pycharm especially for debuging and running tests. And this is important for me because I do not need to create local separated python env per project. I just spin docker container with all dependencies. &amp;#x200B; \- I can run my script/devserver inside pycharm &amp; docker and I can quick navigate to source code on exceptions trackbacks \- I can debug code running on docker in pycharm \- I can run pytest in docker and even debug tests using all features in pycharm including auto test run on code change \- great integration with django, flask, sqlalchemy (debug templates, code completion on custom model managers etc.) \- git integration is neat and I love merge tool in pycharm \- project scopes are very handy especially for big project where i can create scope only for module/part of code that I'm currently working on \- refactoring tools, code navigation, code completion are best in the class for me \- code duplication analysis feature is very handy \- support for databases (run sql queries, explore dbs) out of the box \- integration for issue trackers (jira, youtrack, github etc.) - I can easily create git branches or track time and even manage issue status directly on pycharm &amp;#x200B; I refer to pycharm pro ofcourse, since some of above are not available on community version. VSCode is great tool too and I'm sure that for some devs is more than enough ;)
this is unfunny enough to qualify for /r/ProgrammerHumor 
Well fuck. 
Wait I didn't realize you can duck in the game! I've just been jumping.
/r/python is becoming a joke on itself. People are upvoting simple text prints to the screen if it has the right backstory. OP did not write this code, and did not credit the author: https://youtu.be/bf_UOFFaHiY
He even reused the function names...
 I use it on OS X, and it works flawlessly... I love the ability to open projects into Code, from the command line. One of my favorite features has to be the intellisense, especially for libraries like JQuery. My [Python training](http://pythonandmltrainingcourses.com/) focouses on these implementation.
He didn't write the code, [he copied it.](https://youtu.be/bf_UOFFaHiY)
L
you just copied all of this.
You haven’t heard of github and you made this? I’m jealous ._.
His responses being written as obnoxious as they are makes me think he's a troll
You are right. I'll cross post it
First time i heard of this, nice! I do hope neural accelerators in hardware become at some point in the future as ubiquitous and cheap as cellphones and the like and we're able to put neural networks on freaking anything for little money
How did you give the commands to the Dino?
This is advanced for me LMAO
[Source for the original C implementation for the interested](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/), which uses [the author's own neural network library](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/). Now, for OP, you should know [that the author improved on the algorithm two years later](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.02767), you might want to give it a read in case this could improve your port, apparently the improvements were cumulatively important :)
Can you link this ?
Seems to me like two different projects, the image detection which OP's library does, and another, different pipeline to detect gestures. Then having something else use the input from both. Maybe with gestures it'd be good to have a hardware part on gloves or something like that? I do faintly recall gestures being detected with computer vision and it was non-trivial, but it's been no less than a decade since the last time i checked, and that's ancient times...
Wish I was this cool 👌👏🏼
I mean... you could always set x = 2 to break the loop?
[Copy+pasting](https://youtu.be/bf_UOFFaHiY) code and not giving credit though..
[The video he copy+pasted the code from is here.](https://youtu.be/bf_UOFFaHiY) He didn't even change the function names.
[He didn't make this. Someone else did. He copied this.](https://youtu.be/bf_UOFFaHiY)
While you're at it, [try citing the author](https://youtu.be/bf_UOFFaHiY) you copied the code from.
No, it's not bad practice, if you have a clearly defined interface for your objects. The moment you pass a Potion object in you're letting the other object (Player) use the public interface of the Potion and it's expected to do it. Now, you just have to decide what exactly that interface is :) If it's the .type and .amount attributes, then all is fine. If you want to hide some or all of that then define some Potion method that Player.replenish can call in order to get actionable info: you design a Replenisher interface. Example: Let's say the Replenisher interface means that an object has a .get\_effects() method. Then Player.replenish() can expect to receive a Replenisher and do: class Player: # ... def replenish(self, replenisher): for type_,amount in replenisher.get_effects(): if type_ in self._attributes: self._attributes[type_] = amount # or should it be "+= amount" ? class Potion: # ... def get_effects(self): yield self.type, self.amount Now you have insulated your Player from directly asking for other objects' attributes (as far as Player is concerned, nothing's changed), and as an added bonus you can make any other object a Replenisher by implementing get\_effects() and pass it to an unsuspecting Player (e.g. the Player tries drinking from a cursed stream that turns all their essence into pure power: Health = 1, Mana = 9999999).
JTP!
&gt; he other day I talked with someone about it, and as looks like you think the same, that most of the time we do actually write statically typed programs even when language is dynamic and once in a while we use a dynamic behavior. So ideal language would be statically typed that allows once in a while do some dynamic operation. Exactly. Performance is not really the issue here. In an enterprise setting we would just resort to JVM. And for DSP we use c libraries through Python bindings. The main problem is that dynamic typing encourages bad coding and creates challenges in larger team projects. It think it's nuanced for exactly the reason you mention: &gt; most of the time we do actually write statically typed programs So why keep the current type system?
Let's not clap our hands in unison just yet... [Here his code is side by side with CodeGeek \(youtuber\)](https://imgur.com/a/qU9mlLE) [Here is a link to the youtube video](https://youtu.be/bf_UOFFaHiY) Did we forget to cite an author here OP?
I disagree because the Python syntax (IMO) is vastly superior to any other language out there. I rather not 'public static void main'.
Every now and then I go on a text adventure :) I have been thinking in recent days about how I would go about making one in Python. I did have a really good app about 9 years ago that helped me make them, I can't remember what it was called though, I tried to web search it but couldn't dig it up. Will have to have a rifle through some old USBs for clues XD
Simple projects can be cool, but stealing people's work and portraying it as your own is not.

Inspired by CloudFormation I am creating an application to describe a stack of midi controllers, devices and applications with yaml. I am so fed up with using the Traktor Pro midi config screen and want some more advanced state management, preset management, routing and mapping. It think it's evolving into a pretty cool thing..
Yes, you are. You're also patting everyone on the back even if they're just showing what books they bought or if they feeling down. Enjoy your stay.
oof
I really appreciate that short keyboardflex 😂
Oh I hadn’t looked into it that deeply, thanks for the detective work, u/BoobDetective!
i used that tutorial for help since i wasn’t familiar with python but i didn’t copy and paste it bby

wow big roast. i used this tutorial for help with getting started with python. if you don’t see, i’ve added coordinates for a ducking mechanism and an automatic replay function. i’m not taking python classes or learning in school, it’s tho only way i’ll be able to get started, and i was just proud that i figured it out and wanted to show you guys. 
that's dope, thanks a lot for sharing this

great! 
code bullet did it before, but he used artificial intelligence to make it. mine is much more simple and scans pixels in front of the dino 
Pretty sure Python doesn't have `switch` statements.
indeed it does
Oh my bad then, I'll edit the post
You should use logging in python. Corey Schafer has good video on that on YouTube. 
Seriously this whole post is just a keyboard and mouse flex with copied code. 
Thank you Ill look into it!
dude chill out. i was brand new to python when i started this, i had made a bad calculator before starting making this so i wasn’t completely new. didn’t think you would want me to cite the video because used it as a base to build more off of it.
I would
print("hello world") print("upvotes to the right")

*Still*, using a tutorial where you're shown the code, you 'write' said code yourself, and not giving any credit... 
Some people like to take all the credit for work that isn't theirs.
You really should just link the tutorial you used where *someone else* figured out how to do that stuff and you just copied it over.
You could just write an AI based python code which would reply 'he didn't write the code .......' when someone comments something congratulating . It would save you a lot of time and work, judging that this is a very big community and lots of people are gonna congratulate him and as most of the people don't know about his 'copy" thing.
He didn't figure it out - he just copy/pasted someone elses code verbatim from a youtube video. That's why he has zero clue how he would do that - because he doesn't know how this works to begin with.
um i don’t think i’m trolling..? i’ve been responding most all of the comments and explaining how i did it to anyone who wants to know
It was the same one if you followed the youtube video.
If you decide to 'make this' please make sure you credit the author - unlike OP
No, he just copied a youtube tutorial without crediting the author.
He doesn't know what github is - and he shouldn't post it there considering he didn't write the code for it. If he does, he should give credit to the author, which is a youtube video he copy/pasted from.
Copy/pasting from a youtube video and not giving the original author credit? I don't know if that's 'really impressive'.
Why? This isn't his code. He just copied a youtube tutorial. If he actually *gave credit* to the author and didn't just claim work as his own? Absolutely. But to take someone elses work and pretend it's yours is garbage.
But *you didn't do it*, someone else did. You're not even giving credit to the original author whose code you literally copied. If that's not trolly, it sure is shitty.
How he did it: went to youtube tutorial, copied guys code. Done!
didn’t copy it, i followed the tutorial to learn how to properly set it up and get it to scan the pixels, and i added my own ducking mechanism in it. i needed somewhere to start, and used the tutorial for help
Oh, I didn’t know, I didn’t read the entire thread. My apologies.
&gt;This is a pretty good first project so I'd highly recommend you set one up, "you're a natural, kid!" It's not his project. It's a youtube tutorial he copy/pasted code from. Telling him to setup a github for that is doing the dev world a disservice.
sorry i pissed you off, i thought you guys would find it interesting. like i’ve said earlier i added a few of my own functionalities to it after learning the basics of how to do it. lesson learned, will cite author next time i use a tutorial for help. 
Try matplotlib. Also check out /r/learnpython 
Then link the tutorial. Do not present the work of others as your own.
This will be the project I work on during my next experimentation session with Hoffman's magic potion. Thanks for the resources 
&gt; didn’t copy it, i followed the tutorial to learn how to properly set it up and get it to scan the pixels, and i added my own ducking mechanism in it. i needed somewhere to start, and used the tutorial for help If you used his code for the *primary function of the entire game* then yes, you copied it. If you didn't rightclick &gt; copy, but just rewrote what he was writing on the screen? You *still copied it*. You needed somewhere to start so you went through a tutorial - that's the appropriate way to go about it. But to post on reddit that "you did this" when it's the same function names, same code with only a tiny fraction of it having been changed? That's essentially copying it and without citing the author it's a shitty thing to do. If you copy/paste 99% of something and 'add' just a little tiny bit - it's still copying ***someone elses code***. You didn't make this, you didn't create this, you didn't figure out that ability to scan the pixels (which is the *key factor* to this working) you literally took the 'jump' functionality and made it 'duck' functionality which is trivial at best. Just doing that doesn't mean that you can claim the code as your own. You copied this. I'm glad you are learning programming and Python, but *do not* ever copy someones code (even if you hand-typed it as they did) and claim it as your own. Just say "I followed this tutorial and it was easy" and don't post keyboard-flex videos to /r/Python because you want people to know you can follow a tutorial. We all can, we all have, do it and be happy it worked and post when you've made something *yourself*. 
Thanks for sharing! Looks cool :)
Being new is fine, following a tutorial is fine. Claiming that you made this, not fine.
Edit your post and/or the title and cite the appropriate author. Edit the posts where you claim the work as your own and cite the author of the tutorial. Do not present the work of others as your own.
;) I don't write this to annoy the chap, it's just insanely dishonest, and puts other newbies in a bad light. 
That's cool
It says it needs the shader module cant seem to install via pip is it part of something else?
Building a full Backend with python, redis and mongodb
if you saw the bottom half of the code you would see that it is much longer and different than the tutorial. i did not try to “flex” my keyboard, i was just trying to show you that i wasn’t pressing the space bar or that i didn’t set some macro on the mouse to act as the space bar, sorry if it seemed like i was trying to show off my stuff. will be more careful about citing tutorials

You should edit your posts and/or this thread to cite the author and/or tutorials used.
Did you used a specific library?
jtp!
i’m sorry i’m fairly new to reddit, i’m not sure how to edit my posts title, if you can tell me how i would do that, i’ll change it
the libraries used are pyautogui, PIL, and numpy (pyautogui was for the keyboard input)
I think the current image would look cooler if you could get the blacks saturated more, it looks washed out atm
Interesting. What did you use numpy for?
&gt; i figured it out *But you didn't*, someone else did. Then they *showed you how to do it* and you did what they did and it worked (not surprisingly). Then you added one thing, which is essentially exactly the same as the other just with different coordinates. You did not *figure it out*, all you figured out was how to re-write someone elses code so it works, which isn't new or groundbreaking. Cite the original author - the person who figured it out. 
i used it for the array used to define the coordinates of the box
&gt; mine is much more simple and scans pixels in front of the dino What you meant to say was: "The tutorial I followed gave me code that scans pixels in front of the dino" 
Oh ok. I think i would try to replicate you work. Very nice
It's the new /r/Pics or /r/Awww or any of those other subreddits where people are either professionals with amazing gear/equipment and have been doing it for decades *or* there is the right backstory (i.e. "I have cancer and my cousin just died but I thought this was the most perfect sunset ever" &lt;pic_from_iphone_of_sunset_from_backyard_with_chain_link_fence_at_bottom&gt;) I'm all for people learning things - but copy/pasting from tutorials and building things that someone else already did and acting surprised when they work - that's just what you *do* and you don't post about it. We've all done it. It's very frustrating to see this wave of "look at me!" mentality for people who are literally just copy/paste.
I know the library..I don't know how to tackle this specific plotting
If you known enough to follow a youtube tutorial and write a python program, you can figure out how to google and edit a reddit post. I don't need you taking my instructions and posting them as your own somewhere else.
Mind pointing my me to one? I have to been able to find it. https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/27806/a-deep-learning-approach-that-can-calculate-distance-to-obstacles
You can plot a color by RGB.
Yes!! Very useful. Thanks!
Nope! you need no external resources except the module pyglet, The shader class is in the src/glslhelpers directory. It's shared by sevral shader programs in the repo. 
I'm I missing something all I've got is the code? 
1. you should have pyglet installed: pip install pyglet 2. clone or download the repo to your local machine. 3. run python [fractal3d.py](https://fractal3d.py). That's simple! &amp;#x200B; the [fractal.py](https://fractal.py) requires the glsl helpers in the repo and it calls the shader code in the glsl subdirectory to run on you gpu, so only the py file won't work.
Looks like that's in the glslhelpers directory: [https://github.com/neozhaoliang/pywonderland/tree/master/src/glslhelpers](https://github.com/neozhaoliang/pywonderland/tree/master/src/glslhelpers)
I have a GitHub account and use it with the GitHub desktop application to upload my personal programming projects. I always hear about others using commands or a cli to interface with GitHub (or maybe something local). What's all that about? I've never looked into anything git related and figure I should probably get some insight.
Ah yeah my mistake got it working 
He followed the youtube tutorial linked all over the comments here. *He* didn't do anything except copy/paste the commands you can find in that tutorial (which explains what's going on).
Lmao of course you can’t figure it out you didn’t write any of the hard parts. You could literally just take the mean intensity of the pixels and use it as a threshold for determining whether pixels are mostly black or white... but that would ReQuiRe NOt cOPy PASTinG pyTHon cOdE
Follow the youtube tutorial he didn't cite - the author gives you all the code. It's not impressive, it's copy/paste. 
I think that'a a really nice approach. &gt; amount # or should it be "+= amount" ? I quickly made this example, so they're some mistakes. 
Nah, you can copy/paste the code from the same youtube tutorial he did!
"blacks saturated more", don't quite understand what you refer to \~\~ the black color near the bottom of the sphere?
start with `&gt;&gt;&gt; print("Hello, World!")`
So you can just remove that print statement and try : with open('test.txt', 'w+') as myfile: myfile.write('Your iterated object') And this text file is going to update instantly after writing down every object ! Remember to use \\n to avoid inline writing
Thank you for this post.
I'm attempting to build a diff tool. It is my first actual project that isn't just syntax learning/testing for its own sake. I'm making reasonable progress so far.
`ranges_and_fines = {range(1, 10): 30,` `range(10, 15): 80,` `range(15, 20): 120,` `range(20, 25): 170,` `range(100): 200` `}` Defining ranges and corresponding fines. Using range(100) as a lazy catch all in the end &amp;#x200B; `def check_fine(speedlimit, vehicle_speed):` `if vehicle_speed &gt; speedlimit:` `speeding_range = vehicle_speed - speedlimit` &amp;#x200B; `for speed_range in ranges_and_fines:` `if speeding_range in speed_range:` `return f"${ranges_and_fines[speed_range]} FINE"` `else:` `return "NO FINE."` &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; `print(check_fine(speedlimit=20, vehicle_speed=35))`
I have fifty datapoints which represent the eye shaped figure (all of the four figures are equivalent). 
I'm not the poster you're replying to, but the darkest black seems to be a gray. And all the colors are lacking a vibrancy, it looks like there's a strong gray tinge to everything.
No, the darker values throughout the picture could be adjusted to be near 0 brightness. Here you can see the histogram of the image, where on the left it is completely flat; this means there is no dark parts of the image. If I tell photoshop to scale the values to be full darkness-&gt;brightness, it looks like this https://i.imgur.com/Fxif9Am.jpg

That's cool! Thanks
Ah, don't mind the comment there, I make games like that myself and couldn't help thinking about the actual meaning of the code :)
Could `get_effects(self):` return a tuple? Bare with me here, but I don't see how it's different than passing in a potion and checking if the `type` applies to the character, and then calling the `amount`. It seems you're doing the same just with a `for` loop.
Diving into Selenium Webdriver this weekend to automate uploading files to the cloud.
I think I found why, this is because by default the ambient light is 0 gray. I have pulled a new request to fix this, you can run the updated code to see the result.
Nice gaymer gear
That would still be the same as just calling break. So technically yes, it's entirely possible, but imho it's better to use while True, since you aren't using a variable for that (and an extra line). And its easier to read for others or yourself after a few months. But just look for what works the best for you :) 
Not original and taken from a popular YouTube video. Typical troll.
Do you just want a scatter plot?
YO. Your code looks nice and neat. You seem to enjoy this. If you want to go anywhere with programming IT IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED YOU LEARN GITHUB
Data manipulation is pythons strong point. It is much less verbose so it's very easy to constantly change code to what is needed in an ETL framework. If speed/performance is a necessity use Scala.
have a look at the [loguru](https://github.com/Delgan/loguru) library if you find using the built in logging difficult. I was able to configure the built in logger using tutorials but I couldn't quite get a handle on why it was doing it the way it was. the Loguru library is super handy for all things logging.
It's just you
It can return a tuple, yes. I just generalized it further to a generator. Right now it's no different than what your code does. However, imagine that you decide to implement a Potion._strength attribute, and that should add something to the effective "amount" or strength of the effect. The you just change the returned tuple in get_effects() to reflect this: `yield self.type, self.amount*self._strength` And your Player can now quaff any potion with its supposed effect, while still knowing nothing about how that effect is calculated. Duck typing lets you change the Duck without changing the objects that expect it to feel like a Duck. In this case you wouldn't have to change a thing in Player, even if Potion completely lost the attributes that get_effects() uses right now. You just have to maintain the same type of return value in the interface and it's fine.

The language is not going to be the bottleneck when you are moving data around the internet. Use the language your company is the most proficient in. 
Cool project. Nice to see some raymarching here!
thanks. most ideas/tricks are learned from shadertoy, so the code are also written in a shadertoy style.
I gave a talk comparing cython, ctypes, cffi and cppyy at euroscipy, there is a notebook with the code here https://github.com/mattip/c_from_python
Lol.
Yes, I noticed the shadertoy-like uniform names.
this is something i also want to do it with the opencv in python! which libraries you've used for this?
You guys will probably be interested in [urlwatch](https://github.com/thp/urlwatch) (also in Python).
Definitely loads of redundant code there. You could definitely reduce the codebase by at least 50%. ....LOL
K thanks
I know a better way, if you have a python file, with nothing in it it runs "nothing" and closes.
The way I would try it at first would be to just lower the activation threshold for locations in which a particular object had been identified.
Hey I ran into a bug, can you help me with my program? Traceback (most recent call last): File "&lt;pyshell#0&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt; nothing NameError: name 'nothing' is not defined
But then it doesn't do anything. Why would you write a program like that?? &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
shit I haven't thought this far ahead I already pushed production shitttttttttttttttt
this has to be one of the best written and documented programs i have ever seen, 3 and half stars from me sir!
You got mere there for a moment. Didn't know that was possible, thanks!
I manually clean some data in Excel up to the bare minimum to import into our database where I do the bulk of my job. I've written a few functions that work with openpyxl to perform some common tasks (replace values in a column using a map of value:new value, add leading zeroes, remove duplicate and blank rows, etc.) Now I'm working on making a small program for each client that uses that library to clean their data for import. It took me about 6 hours to learn openpyxl, about 6 hours to write and debug the library of common functions, and it will take me about 6-12 more hours to write these scripts. It automates about 10-30 minutes of work 15 times per week, so call it 3 hours per week. It should pay off in around 2 months, which is just fine by me. If anyone knows how to automate this use case, please let me know: after copying an .xltm template and saving as an .xlsx, I click 'Edit Links' in Excel and link each file to a new file. But when I try to open the file in the first place using openpyxl, I get some error because it has an image in it, so that's slowing me down too.
Thank you for this, I was unaware of more-itertools and realized a couple of projects implement a few of those existing functions. Very handy! 
Once I finish up this project, I'm going to ssh into the old raspberry pi and work on something actually. I enjoy writing on/for it quite a bit. Great little tool if I need to have something running 24/7 and not kill my light bill.
I think he meant physically coding w/ the crackberry keyboard.
You are seriously the best!
True, but when not using the crackberry I actually code on my 3B+ hooked up to my TV.
 Currency = {'GBP': 1, 'USD': 1.30, 'EUR':1.15, 'JPY':150, 'AUD':1.75, 'CHY':8.8 } print ('Hello and Welcome to Pyhton Currency Exchange') print ('Here are the list of currencies available') print ('GBP=Great British Pound,USD=United States Dollar') print ('EUR=Euro,JPY=Japanese YEN,AUD=Australian Dollar,CHY=Chinese Yuan') curr = str(input('First type in which currency you have')) LA = int(input('How much do you have?')) def converstion(): TA = Currency\[curr\] \* LA return (TA) print (converstion()) This is what i got now i will soon add 2 more things like curr and LA then add them to the function and that will should get me the results i want. Any tips or ideas would be fine. I haven't had the time to do it/check it
Wait waaaa (pickachu meme) then why would i use str for i thought input allowed everything and str made it into a str...
Just to note: you don't need your calculated value of `p`. `1/6` in Python will give you a float, unlike some other languages where it will give you `0`. If you want to run this 100 times and output to a CSV, replace your loop with something like this. I haven't used Python 2 in a while so the print syntax might be a bit off - basically we're just printing the number rolled, a comma, and then no newline until we're done with our loop. for i in range(100): P = [40] while P[-1] &gt; 0: r = binomial(P[-1],p) P.append(P[-1]-r) rolls += 1 print (r + ','), print '' Then you should be able to run it like this without needing to get into any IO stuff: python myprogram.py &gt; output.csv
/r/gonwild 
Working through this [intro to python for ds course](https://courses.springboard.com/p/intro-to-python-course-data-science?src=reddit). It uses the Yelp open data set, pretty cool!
no, input reads everything as a string and str makes a string out of that string... which makes no sense, it serves no purpose
&gt;Pytorch :) &amp;#x200B;
Hello, Since release of this program I've used it quite successfully in production. My whole codebase is now dependent on it. Unfortunately we had to reassign the CTRL+C shortcut and now my code does not work. Please add an option to pass the exit shortcut via parameter. Thanks in advance! PS: Please PEP8 your code
That's the point, you don't get to write it.
First off it's not marked as code on reddit - indent every line by 4 spaces to do that. There are a few typos (e.g. pyhton or converstion) in it, it doesn't conform to PEP8. There's code that is not really future proof (the "GBP= Great British Pound" etc. lines - this should be automated). The str call on input makes no sense since input already gives a string (the int call does though). &amp;#x200B; I'll fix a version up, but I'd ask you to try and solve those problems yourself before looking at it.
I like codewars.com and exercism.io
you prefer coding on a cell phone? how does that work? i mean, i get how it works, but how is it enjoyable? what do you use to write code?
Sorry, didn't know about it. 
Fancy guardians from BotW.
Thanks man for teaching me how to ask questions on reddit. I never asked python Q on it before. I will try to do it myself since it is the best way of learning. &amp;#x200B;
The github desktop is probably fine for casual use, but with the command-line interface, you're sort of 'forced' to learn how Git works. And, once you do have a handle on it, you can do stuff a lot faster than you can through the desktop. I recommend picking it up if you have some time, but I wouldn't say it's mandatory or anything.
To read an Excel sheet, I'd use xlrd or openpyxl. The former is definitely faster, but I think the latter is easier to use. You'd basically just go down a row and apply the same function to every cell in the column that needed to be cleaned. Actually picking that new value is a different question. I see a few options: - Use a dictionary that looks like this: `{'Capil One': 'Capital One', 'Capitalone': 'Capital One'}` or this: `{['Capil One', 'Capitalone']: 'Capital One'}` - Lowercase and remove blank spaces and special characters: `'capilone'` and `'capitalone'` are easier to work with, and one of them is already correct - Come up with a 'most similar to' approach to find close matches: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10018679/python-find-closest-string-from-a-list-to-another-string - A combination of the above I'd probably do something like this: 1. Read a new value from the column. 2. Transform that value to lowercase, remove spaces, remove special characters 3. Find if that value is similar to preset values such as `'capitalone'` using `difflib.get_close_matches` as described in that StackOverflow link 4. If the value was not similar enough to one of those values, either leave it alone or add it to your list of preset values so that other similar answers will be grouped together 5. If the value was similar enough to one of those values, transform it using a dict: `{'capitalone': 'Capital One'}` so that it looks prettier 6. Continue to the next row and go to step 1. 
Take a look at cron for Mac/linux or Task Scheduler for Windows
is it simple on working with pytorch than the opencv? 
Exercism.io
Look into string distance. There are algorithms that can tell you how far apart two strings are, so if a user types in an unknown value you can check it against a database of known good values and correct it to the closest string. Might not be perfect for your application though. Also a better sub for this would be r/learnpython or r/learnprogramming
Digital Blasphemy let's gooooooooo!
This is amazing, didn't know python can do this. Code is very small as well.
Interesting. Is there any practical reason to give a type hint with anything other than a type?
ok great ;) some words that may help you in the solution: for loop, f-string
Agreed, a better implementation is as follows: `` #!/usr/bin/env python3.7 # -*- encoding: utf-8 -*- """A program that exits its self.""" import sys def close_program(exit_code): """Close program.""" sys.exit(exit_code) If __name__ == '__main__': exit_code = 0 # Program executed correctly close_program(exit_code) ``
I don't know, but I imagine this is specific to the OS and/or device, so you'll probably need to be more specific.
If you're on a PC, have you tried F11?
Look at Tkinter and pygame, there are several examples for this. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24027462/simple-example-of-displaying-an-image-fullscreen-in-python 
Do you mean a Python source code ? Or what exatly do you mean ?
For example, I have seen them being used in the [begins](https://pypi.org/project/begins/) library to specify command-line option help: &gt;&gt;&gt; import begin &gt;&gt;&gt; @begin.start ... def run(name: 'What, is your name?', ... quest: 'What, is your quest?', ... colour: 'What, is your favourite colour?'): ... pass This will generate usage: test.py [-h] -n NAME -q QUEST -c COLOUR optional arguments: -n NAME, --name NAME What, is your name? -q QUEST, --quest QUEST What, is your quest? -c COLOUR, --colour COLOUR What, is your favourite colour?

This is neato! Last year I wrote an almost similar program that replaces the Windows background with a live shader viewer. Something along the lines of Wallpaper Engine meets shadertoy. Check it out: https://github.com/Elizabwth/win-shader-wallpaper

Hug?
Did you ever manage to do this? I'm currently trying to figure out a way to implement something like this and am not sure where to even begin! 
Not exactly non-traditional but I enjoy coding on multiple monitors &amp; devices at the same time. My best setup was a pi 3 connected to a TV hosting the website I was editing while my phone viewed the site and most of the editing was done on my laptop with an external monitor.
I think I did and if I did it's already uploaded [here](https://gitlab.com/r-russo/dice-image). I didn't work as expected though but I think I prefer it over my first try. Try it and have fun. The basic idea is there, the rest is doing experiments :)
Thats beautiful! I might implement that, just in case my second line fails.
thanks
Great, thanks! I'll have a look over the code and play around :) 
Another exapmle where non-type annotations can be used is documentation: def kinetic_energy(mass: 'in kilograms', velocity: 'in meters per second'): ... (The example is from [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/7811344).)
Wait, can this even at all be ran on Linux? Even though Python, I can't get it to work.
ahaha whoa didn't realize

Thanks for that! I wasn't aware you could actually access `__annotations__` and use it to validate, like one of the examples in that thread does.
I do not think that you do anything wrong. The code is supposed to fail with \`KeyError\` on the third line.
But they are used for different purposes :) In my project, they are used together :)
Oh, I've read it incorrectly. Sorry.
Django is a bit on the heavy side but would work. Maybe flask would be better though.

You may find this [article](https://medium.com/dreamcatcher-its-blog/four-amazing-python-books-that-i-recommend-to-every-beginners-44b4324cb6bb) helpful :) 
ahaha hey so glad to see you here, you totally inspired me to make this post &lt;3
&gt;ages\['John'\]: 42 &gt; &gt;... &gt; &gt;As for the fact that 42 is not a type, this also does not matter as the right-hand side of an annotation can be any valid Python expression Has always really annoyed me about the type annotation implementation. It's just doesn't seem worth the extra baggage.
When annotations were originally added they were marketed as general purpose with an emphasis on / expected usage of type annotations but quickly wound up being more or less explicitly for type annotations with other uses being 'deprecated but supported and frowned upon'. Beyond that there's a difference between types and type annotations - much of the typing lib and what are intended to be used as type annotations aren't 'types' - they [cannot be instantiated](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/df5cdc11123a35065bbf1636251447d0bfe789a5/Lib/typing.py#L667-L668), [are not subclasses of type](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/df5cdc11123a35065bbf1636251447d0bfe789a5/Lib/typing.py#L1189-L1203), and in some cases [aren't even easily introspectable](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/df5cdc11123a35065bbf1636251447d0bfe789a5/Lib/typing.py#L1413-L1437).
Why not both? PySpark is a great choice - it has a nice Python API (similar to Pandas) and uses Scala for data processing on the back end.
&gt; I actually code on my 3B+ hooked up to my TV and a Bluetooth keyboard with a built in trackpad. Yeah, but that's normal. :P

Yes I mean in code. I’m trying to write a simple program that takes photos in a folder and runs a fullscreen slideshow on a windows pc. But every technique I’ve found in tkinter or pygame only shows the window inside a browser window instead of a true borderless fullscreen.
Thanks I’ll check this out! I’ve looked into both of those had not previously found a solution that provided a true borderless fullscreen image.
May i suggest wrapping it in an context manager so it is more convienant to use! =)
I don’t want to do it manually. I want to write a small program that takes photos from a folder and creates a slideshow with fullscreen borderless images.

Well you already got the told some of the best resources out there, I tried this one when I started just as a intro to MI [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3l\_aeGjkeI&amp;list=PLR0bgGon\_WTJnvH92Ls\_Vj4ueCi98PDW5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3l_aeGjkeI&amp;list=PLR0bgGon_WTJnvH92Ls_Vj4ueCi98PDW5)
Exactly. As I tried to explain in the blog post, you can just change the extension of your file or files to pyx, profile your code, and optimize the bottlenecks. When your code is fast enough, you can leave the rest as pythony as it was.
This is neat. Stealing this for my wallpaper.
That example with validation looks insanely hacky but could be useful for one of my packages. I just got started with typing and had no idea there are so many practical uses beyond linting. Thanks for posting this.
Use ConfigParser normally to get the specific string that has the `%20` in it, then feed that string through `urllib.parse.unquote` to convert percent-encoded characters back to single code points.

Thank you! But I tried that, and ConfigParser doesn’t seem to like the % at all unfortunately... I get a configparser.InterpolationSyntaxError, “‘%’ must be followed by ‘%’ or ‘(‘“.
Make sure you remember to download a decent text editor. I recommend sublime for beginners.
When you create the `ConfigParser`, set `interpolation` to `None`. (https://docs.python.org/3/library/configparser.html#customizing-parser-behaviour)

Pycharm is far more polished and complete. My only concern is that developers tend to save their .idea folders and do not know how to turn this into a runnable standalone project on our CI servers. If you like to do everything within a GUI it is for you. VSC have major issues with the Microsoft Python Language Server (there is a new version coming), it eats memory, it crashes, it hangs. It works fine on small projects but if you use venv and pyenv with lots of subclassing and lots of files (It does not support more than 1024 files currently) I never dare to press Crtl + mouse on method, because it just hangs. Earlier it ate up all my 32GB. Python in Visual Studio though seem to work fine using the same language server (but I do not like to install 5GB of bloat just for running an editor). &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
Computer generated art is amazin'. This is so interesting. Thanks for sharing it. 
What is the math behind this?
So I have looked in to this in more detail and I will be implementing a fix soon. I will either be using a call to \_posixsubprocess.fork\_exec() or a new call that should be in python 3.8, os.posix\_spawn(). &amp;#x200B; This makes me wonder why os.fork() exists at all in python
I am a maintainer (recently added) of this project and wanted to x-post this here in hopes of getting some more opinions.
I love reading this kid getting roasted haha
Hi! I'm a human! Other humans made a mistake when they designed the current python subreddit layouts. /r/python ought to be where beginners go, and there should be - and hey, lookit, there **are** subreddits for advanced or non-beginning python such as /r/advancedpython and /r/pythonnews. Humans being humans, that'll probably never happen. Therefore, I recommend you obey this bot. Because reality isn't perfect, and this situation is a perfect example of that. :P
For example, Plumbum can use type annotations to validate/convert supplied command line arguments to your program with any python callable (ensure supplied directory exists, etc.). 
Am I a bad person for sticking with the "it's nobody's business what my programs do with annotations" attitude? I really really don't like how they were introduced in an agnostic way and then shifted expectations, not only to type hinting, but specific syntax type hinting. 
One of the reasons why type hints are allowed for non-types is that without [PEP 563](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0563/)(which is still [behind a feature gate](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0563/#enabling-the-future-behavior-in-python-3-7)) the following isn't allowed: class Foo: def bar(self, other: Foo): ... Python is a fully imperative language, so when the declaration of `bar` is evaluated - `Foo` does not yet exist and we cannot use it. To circumvent this limitation, type checkers and completion libraries allow using a string instead of the actual type object: class Foo: def bar(self, other: `Foo`): ... And strings are not types. Why is the limitation not _type or `str`_? No idea. Maybe that was sounding too arbitrary?
Hey, I think this refers to this module: [https://swiftcoder.wordpress.com/2008/12/19/simple-glsl-wrapper-for-pyglet/](https://swiftcoder.wordpress.com/2008/12/19/simple-glsl-wrapper-for-pyglet/) which can be found here on github: [https://github.com/johnfredcee/pyglsl/blob/master/shaders.py](https://github.com/johnfredcee/pyglsl/blob/master/shaders.py)
It dates from before threads *existed*, I think.
As the bot has told you before, I'm going to suggest you try asking in /r/learnpython. You'll want to show the code you've got and explain where you're stuck, but don't expect the sub to do your homework for you. You'll also need to format your code correctly, [here's some information](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/faq#wiki_how_do_i_format_code.3F) on how to properly format the code

I agree with him. I have never used it and am not sure if I ever will, but I like it for the aesthetics.
I suppose then we can get rid of the "no need for it" and instead say "need it for the aesthetics". Not a functional reason, but still a reason.
nope, it's in the same repo in the /glslhelpers/ dir. please download the whole repo and run fractal3d.py
your second image looks great!
IT's called pseudo Kleinian, proposed by knighty at fractalforums. It's based on a very simple "folding formula" p = 2.0 \* clamp(p, vec3 a, vec3 b) - p.
&gt; much of the typing lib and what are intended to be used as type annotations aren't 'types' - they cannot be instantiated, are not instances of type, and in some cases aren't even easily introspectable. Though [Hypothesis still tries](https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/data.html#hypothesis.strategies.from_type)! It looks like there's a *lot* of logic to handle whatever `typing` actually is at runtime, including introspection of NewType thingies, and it works disturbingly well.
your program is graet! I know it's not easy to export so many shaders from shadertoy. I'm still new to shaders and I have years way to go to create fancy animations like the top players on shadertoy.
Cool
Looks cool! Can you demo this in a video for us? Thanks!
Reminds me of that Palantir article. After I read that I wanted to build something like this. Seems like too much work. Are you going to keep expanding it?
I would like to but I do not have a decent GPU, I only have a laptop with Intel® HD Graphics 510 (Skylake GT1) ... so saving a high quality video is an impossible task for me.
That basically summed up my feelings when I first started learning.
Haha
I'm working on a tool that will gather bioinformatics data from a database in various useful ways. I'm doing it to speed up formatting for downstream analysis so people won't have to query and subset manually. Could actually use some advice on how to structure the interface with the database.

Not looking to use you, but I'd totally sign up w/ you if someone had an idea
noted!
Have you thought of contributing to some open source projects?! Or do you want to show examples of an entire project built by you? 
oh, i hadn’t thought of that! most of the stuff i’ve built are just small little programs. i might contribute to an open source project, that’s a good idea!
Think about some of the python packages you find very useful and go to their GitHub. See if there are a lot of issues or just some issues but their really old (maybe it’s one developer that needs help). Just a thought. 
will do, thanks!
Project Euler
You can help me though, I am trying to build a python program to effectively interface with cups and some we service to expose the results over net. Let me know if you are interested.
i’m interested! I’ll dm you
Could you tell us a little bit more about your familiar use cases for the modules you mentioned?
Wow, brilliant. What's the track playing in the background? You got great taste.
Just curious, why do you hate JSON?
I'm not smart enough to figure out any of the libraries for it lol lol Have any good articles, by chance?
What happens?
&gt;article I was trying the same thing this week, but I got crazy frustrated. I can't seem to get the damn bot to work when there is an argument included with the CommandHandler call. Figured I would take a few days off and try to re-tackle it with fresh eyes soon.
I don’t know what level you’re at. But googling “python json” is a great place to start. [Real python has some good articles.](https://realpython.com/python-json/) 
Different strokes for different folks I guess 
Awesome. I definitely gotta get onto Cython. I wrote C in uni about 15 years ago.. good learning experience but I would hate to have to do it all the time. Being able to switch in and out at your leisure would be the best thing ever.
Had tried Google already. &amp;#x200B; Never heard of Real Python, thanks.
If you know the name of the HTML element, (can be found by inspecting element) using bs4 you can actually specifically search for that element rather than what you did. So for HTML that looks like this, &lt;div class="price"&gt; first &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class="value"&gt; second &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class="value price "&gt;third &lt;/div&gt; You can search for a specific class such as “price” using something along the lines of: tags = soup.find('div', {'class': ‘price’}) Sorry for the poor formatting as I’m on mobile and not too sure how to format the code. Hope this helps make things easier. 
Have you looked into "www.freelancer.com"?
I initially tried this with the id of "subscriber-count" b/c that's what inspect element told me it was called. It didn't work though I tried multiple ways. Thanks for the suggestion tho. &amp;#x200B; Then I gave up and tried this approach.
I can tell you this is the hard way no easy one ! It doesn't make sense that you hate dict ! json is just a mix of some data structures . and you can parse it in python using json module easily . If it is hard for you to read it . so it's another matter I am advising you to use pprint module to prettify output for better reading . I don't know how far you wanna go but this kind of scraping is not going to be easy and safe in bigger programs . Let me explain more . first of all API is some kind of moderated access to a specific program database so when it is moderated it means you can use everything in that API which are permitted to use . so you don't need to be worry about anything you just write down your code you can use it anytime and anywhere and you can expand your code easily ... so maybe you think you can expand and upgrade this scraper ? so the answer is yes/no . yes for now but after first upgrade on youtube (such as changing theme , or changing attributes in html ... ) you are going to have problems in your code . beside that you can run into problems at using this code for sending fast requests (spam like) so maybe you run into a captcha or something which is going to break your code and you need to code more and more just to do some maintain in your code . if you are going to make bigger programs just go for API when it's available , believe me it's really easy and helpful . But after all if you think you are comfortable with scraping things ... this is my advice ; use better tools for scraping like scrapy it's a powerful framework like tool which helps you make a project with spiders and more ... see it yourself : [link](https://scrapy.org)
Will do ,thanks 
Yeah, I know it wouldn't scale too good. Once it didn't work with JSON, I went off HTML more to see if I could. &amp;#x200B; I've heard of scrapy, but I'll take a closer look. Thanks!
What's so hard about learning JSON? It's one the easiest data structures to learn and you just access it like a dictionary. It's just a dictionary that contains other objects. `requests` even has json built in. response = requests.get(url) data = response.json()
My issue ended up being the nested dicts in the response
This is really cool but i have a couple of questions. How do I dump the screenshot somewhere? And as far as the scenes, i have to look at the code a bit more but maybe we could just have the values that could change and perhaps even parameters (such as 10-90) to keep it from blowing up. Then i could add a script to randomize it. 
Then you just do nested accessing. `data["data"]["whatever"]["other_things"]`
To save screenshots, sinply press "Enter". Yes, there are lots of paramters, magic number/functions to tweak with, then lots of different fractals you will find. It would be nice to put them in a single config file, but I just want to keep the code short and simple. I think it's best to use sliders to adjust them, like shader softwares Fragmentarium, etc. But I think that's too heavy for a lightweight UI like pyglet ... the error is because the resolution size exceeds your GPU's capability to render, I have the same problem on my laptop. To render a large wall paper you need a desktop machine with decent display. 
Also preemptively thanking anyone who sorts by new
https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#input
By reading the documentation available to you. For example, the sidebar on this subreddit telling you that questions relating to the learning of python are not allowed here, and should be directed to /r/learnpython.
Read the sidebar for subreddit rules, this belongs in /r/learnpython , not here.
Drop that quotation mark after the colon. ' I am Python, what is your name? ' :

Don't use 2.7
One of my internships wanted me to do this but the place was so heavily regulated I wasn't legally allowed to use anything lol It's definitely something worth going into depth with if you're interested
I am getting this error. Not clear which module's version is it talking about. I am using Python 3.6.7 on MacOS Mojave. $ pwd ./pywonderland/src/aperiodic-tilings $ python wangtile.py ERROR: 0:1: '' : version '130' is not supported ERROR: 0:1: '' : version '130' is not supported ERROR: 0:45: 'switch' : Reserved word. ERROR: 0:45: 'switch' : syntax error: syntax error Keyboard control: 1. press Enter to save screenshots. 2. press Esc to exit. &amp;#x200B;
Find a way to draw comparisons to other programming languages you already know. Make something you could actually use maybe like a sports score ticker, or home automation. May sound daunting, but splitting the job up I to little sections will be easier. Copy paste code and run it. Tweak it and see what happens. 
i dunno but 1) don’t use 2.7 and 2) get Sublime Text. it’s a text editor and you can write in python and any other language you want, with much better visualization and versatility 
Yeah, the Blackberry is odder than the TVPi
It has a Python IDE I downloaded on it. There are some great ones for Android though actually.
You can't really do time series analysis on a single stock. Well, you can do it but the results are useless. I think technical analysis only has a place in relative value as opposed to outrights but even then you can't blindly follow a model because there are real points in time where material information can come out
There's gradient of solutions that depends on the difficulty of the task. At the simplest end are simple DOM processors that load html and let you pick out information. There are various libraries for doing that. The most complicated jobs require Selenium, which runs Firefox or Chrome in the background to parse fully rendered pages (including Javascript, etc.).
DOM processors being things like bs4? 
Is there a easy library for grabbing Google sheets data?

Very cool! Boto3 has by far the worst, absurd and ugly API I've ever seen in my life. The whole thing is so convoluted and uses so many strings that it might as well be an SQL query with their own magical syntax. _/angry boto3 user_ 
This is because your machine does not support glsl version 130, or opengl 3.0 it seems your machine only supports version 120 (opengl 2.0), so may be you should try run it on a not-so-old machine?
Yeah that's makes sense. I just seen those post and quickly pulled down the code to try and get it up and running on a old "kitchen" laptop that I recently revitalized with lubuntu. I'll give it a try in my desktop. I'll see if I can figure out the randomization part on my own.
all things windows and python, I go to [https://www.lfd.uci.edu/\~gohlke/pythonlibs/](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/) For the last few years, at least, this site has maintained up to date, reliable windows builds. Just download the whl file for your version of python (from [python.org](https://python.org)) and pip install xx.whl.
I love it! I recently started a web crawling blog http://crawl.blog to cover this subject as it's a pretty big niche that is not represented well enough and there's just a big lack of well formatted information out there. Generally with python I stick to: `Scrapy` for big projects - it's like Django of web-crawling. It's model driven and easy to extend. I maintain around 20 huge crawlers that all use scrapy because it so easy to extend, maintain and debug. `Aiohttp`, `requests-futures` and `treq` for smaller scripts - the first two are fun new toys in web-crawling niche. Python is getting a lot work done on async side of things and the async/await syntax is just beautiful. However personally I prefer callback workflow as I feel it gels better with web-crawling so I often use twisteds `treq` which is callback driven requests framework. For html parsing `parsel` is a clear de facto standard as css and xpath selectors are just so fast and powerful.

This question seems confused. Why would an API request require chrome? What does a hotkey have to do with logging into an API? Do you mean the REPL when you say "Python shell"? You're going to have to share some code or more details.

That is the most beautiful fractal I’ve ever seen
That's the thing, it is not exactly a scatter plot and this is what I'm trying to figure out. It has to do something with degrees and stuff 
Exactly what I wanted and was searching for 2 days. Thx anon
This is really neat! Is there a list of things that native Remi can do that PySimpleGuiWeb can't do yet? And, are there advantages to using the underlying frameworks directly as opposed to PySimpleGui? More fine-tuned control I'm guessing? I'm trying to decide on a framework to learn, but there doesn't seem to be much information on disadvantages of any framework relative to another, and I don't want to throw too much time into learning one only to discover I would have done better with a different one (this happened with Tkinter...).
Nice thing you did here. That sure is a lot of required libraries though... I'm not too keen on installing a ton of libraries is there any way to reduce the required number of these so that I can try it out? I only have numpy currently
I honestly can't tell if this article is being sarcastic or not and just mapped out their data because they wanted to prove a point Either way I want to do this now lol
Yes
&gt; Boto3 has by far the worst, absurd and ugly API I've ever seen in my life i've never used boto, but i'd like to challenge that with the entire ELK stack. if you haven't used it, you're lucky
you should consider submitting that to typeshed: https://github.com/python/typeshed/ 
i don't think that's how this works, but it is very kind of you to offer to help yourself for free
Stack overflow is good for help same with tutorials point python. When you get more advanced check out adventofcode which has challenging programming problems. Do lots of practice, and try a variety of problems.
&gt; Why is the limitation not type or str? No idea. Maybe that was sounding too arbitrary? The original syntax of annotations was baked into the language at a time when multiple possible use cases were envisioned. Type hints were *one* of those use cases, but the feature is called "annotations" and populates `__annotations__`, rather than being called "type hints" and populating `__type_hints__`.
That was my first instinct, too. My original intention when writing this was to submit to typeshed, but I really don't think that this package can be folded into it. Unfortunately, I don't think this is possible because of the factory functions \`boto3\` uses. It's pretty unreasonable to expect an IDE to read the string \`'s3'\` in \`boto3.client('s3')\` and then know which object was created. Regardless, I wasn't able to figure out a way (if there is one) to make PyCharm analyze .pyi files for classes that aren't defined in .py files\*. Also, given the ephemeral nature of any API spec, I don't think an sdk is a good candidate for inclusion into typeshed. &amp;#x200B; \\\* I was able to use .pyi files to define non-existent methods of a class which had a concrete definition in a .py file in another project which is also on my github.
Thanks for the article! But, is the given website safe for personal data protection?
huh? this is an exchange. i write *free* code for someone, partly in exchange for being able to say “hey, i wrote some code for that project” and because i enjoy writing code. whilst it is helpful to me, it’s helping someone else. it would be unfair if they were losing any money or something by letting me write code in their project, but they’re not. it’s free. 
One thing everyone will need is selenium for all of the JS loving websites. Or ones with lots of cookies that change with every request. Or iframes. Stupid Fiserv bank site. 
im saying you responded to your own post offering to help someone by saying you were interested and going to dm yourself. it was a light-hearted way to tell you you responded to the wrong person
It's a MacBook Pro (13-inch, 2017) with Intel Iris Plus Graphics 640 1536 MB. I don't think it's that old. But yes I have - `$ glxinfo | grep "OpenGL version"` `OpenGL version string: 2.1 INTEL-12.4.7` Let me check how I can upgrade it. Thanks.
oh, sorry dude, misunderstood that. that’s actually quite funny. also if you post me on r/woooosh then cover my name with a picture of idubbbz
:D
Try FLASK framework. Apparently it's quite fun for using Python to makes websites.
i wouldn't use it. I'm biased though. I don't like any JS transpiling tools. historically it made sense because javascript used to be difficult to develop and browsers were finicky, but the ecosystem and tooling have matured immensely and browser vendors are playing along with each other, converging on similar levels of feature support. now, javascript development is pretty easy. GWT, typescript, dart, whatever, are unnecessary layers of complexity. Debugging becomes dependent on plugins and tools built on plugins and tools. don't get me wrong, those tools are impressive for the major frameworks. i just find it easier to write javascript or at least the pure framework code. there's not as much to wrap your head around i would just learn the framework you want to use. they're pretty good nowadays, especially vue also: @view def index_page(p, title, block): with p.html(): with p.head(): with p.title(): p.text(title) with p.body(): with p.header(): with p.h1(): p.text(title) with p.section(): p.text(block) that looks fucking terrible
It's quite uncommon a machine nowadays that does not support glsl130. I have tested the code on (&gt;5) different machines (company, home, friend's, family's), they all run with no problem.
That gets back to my previous question. Which part of Figure 1? A, B, C, D, E, or F? \&gt; It has to do something with degrees and stuff Are you talking about Figure 1-F? That's happens to have a circle on it. It has nothing to do with degrees though. It is not a polar plot.
If your familiarity with both is the same, in Python you will get it done faster, easier. If you use tools like Numpy, Pandas and Dask, as their implementation is C underneath, it will be pretty fast. Even if you used plain Python and the final Java program was faster, the extra development time would be more expensive. If you want the absolute maximum performance, you can use C (don't do that!), but it will take you a year instead of a week. Also, if performance is still an issue, you can use several JIT tools/interpreters in Python. Unless you're already quite familiar with Java, far that specific problem, go with Python.
Trying to trick OP into learning an incredibly marketable skill (that also happens to he fun), eh?
Not a trick dude. I'm kinda new to Python and flask helped me understand python better. Besides how would I be tricking OP? I'm just trying to help the community. You don't see any links to a 'sign up to my udemy course' do you? Plank. 
you map of where you have been kind of looks like someone riding a bike. or riding something else ;)
Honestly, I just started reading the documentation itself and it's pretty good at explaining the basic language. Here's a link to the PDF: [https://docs.python.org/3/download.html](https://docs.python.org/3/download.html)
This wonderful. Thanks for sharing it.
Currently writing an essay on privacy which includes info on data breaches by corporations and governments, I'm currently convinced that nothing is safe for personal data protection
Thank you. That would really help. Delving into a new concept can be pretty tough but getting basics first is a good way to begin.
Is that Al Sweigart on stage?
Nice one. I learned something more! Maybe IDEs might shade annotations so that they are visibly distinct? &amp;#x200B;
Most likely moto-ricksha. 
Fuck, has it already started?

You can use the os library or the pathlib library. os has lots of functions for making and manipulating files and directories. 
There is a library called talib with all kinds of moving averages, fibonnaci, etc etc. I doubt you'll have much success because predicting stocks is almost impossible but you can give it a go. An important concept is autoregression, you can lag the time series against itself so you see how it's changing day to day.

You want to detect the speed of the game to know when to jump? Ok, it's probably scaled linearly so pulling out your high school linear algebra can get you through a lot of that. But what if you also want to detect the speed _and_ know when to time a jump so you don't hit a bird (the birds kill you, right? I've not played Dino for a while) when you jump a cactus? Problems like that get super interesting really quickly. One way is to implement a path finding algorithm. They work by studying the current state of the game, and then looking at all the current possible actions the player can take, and then chooses the best one. The A* algorithm tends to get used for this. So for Dino you could be constantly monitoring for incoming cactus and birds, and begin to plot potential paths to time jumps. Here's Mario being played by an AI using the A* approach. They helpfully draw all the possible paths being considered each frame: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=DlkMs4ZHHr8 A* works well, but it doesn't understand the game and doesn't really understand the game and is likely going to have trouble getting through complex levels. Another approach is a pure machine learning method: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=qv6UVOQ0F44 The AI starts off knowing nothing about the game, and learns how to play by trial and error. Although this approach will probably yield a Mario AI which can navigate more complex levels, the complexity of the implementation and time to train are big negatives. 
Yes, already started. This was day 1, day 2 starts tomorrow.

Why not just use [networkx]( https://networkx.github.io/) instead of implementing your own graph and graph algorithms?
1. Because I tried several months ago to install this package but got many problems 2. This way of doing it is far more easier 3. Why dont you answer the question?
Implementing your own graph is almost never the right answer. Your error is from trying to install a networkx optional dependency. Just install networkx by itself to start with. No one is obligated to help you, especially me.
You've linked a website with a single download link for a .msi. No python code. No indication that it isn't an attempt at a virus. If you're proud of a Python project, link a python project, not an executable.
[I hope this minimal example makes it clear](https://tio.run/##TYxBCsIwFAX3PcWjq3zsonYpeACP8WNSEqxJaH5JPX0MYkWY3TCTXuJimGqdccXCT20YigdouoBxgu66tPogqhfnMxouFnhBiesj9/S1s1LnccA0EtGv0JvgqIpjwa1V22Jg92TvzcXPBT5ksWz@Zser1jc). In other words `f = lambda (a, b): a + b` is equivalent to def f((a, b)): return a + b ... which is roughly equivalent to def f(a): return a[0] + a[1] ... while I would expect it to be the much more common: def f(a, b): return a + b

The website shows the link to the source on github. If you download [the source](https://github.com/theopolisme/location-history-visualizer) (no app, just HTML and JavaScript) you can do it yourself.
It's odd and entirely inefficient. I have too much respect for my code to subject myself to that.
It is an open source website, i have just seen it. Thank you again.
Nice. I'm in a similar quest. Share your blog man. Good luck!
indeed it took me some weekends... typically a problem that followed me from work. I tried to figure out differences between xml files without knowledge about their structure/grammer. The result is the incredible mighty XmlXdiff package 😶: https://github.com/mmoosstt/XmlXdiff two xml's go in, one svg comes out. try it out it's pipible... and i need feedback to proceed, have a nice weekend

I’m a fan of memberships to self paced learning websites. They offer a ton of hands on learning. Some are free, some ask for a fee, but it would be a good place to go no matter what level of data science. Code academy’s fun, udemy has specific courses you can buy access to if you know what they are interested in. 
Good Luck! I'm in the same boat. 
Your being downvoted but you’re right, part of it is people’s ignorance. 
Good luck to you too mate. 
Best of luck. Make sure to utilise r/learnpython - it is better to learn with others.

Hey man, I dont mean to be a stick in the mud, but your post history shows that you do seem to repost the same application notes to this sub. I have definitely seen this one before a few months ago. You only seek to ha e responded this time because there is another one out. That kind of blows :( I am happy to engage with zerynth products if it felt like there was am engineer who was more approvhsble aboutbthosbstuff, and less like a marketing machine. God knows I could use something like this at work.
Some, like tqdm, aren’t strictly necessary (tqdm provides a nice loading bar), but I would have to write it in a way that lets you run script without it. These aren’t very large packages though, and there shouldn’t be much problem installing them. Just open a terminal window, `cd` to the directory, then do `pip install -r requirements.txt`
Your joke? It's bad.
The article has been published on the blog on Feb 7, 2019. It's a new content. The article introduces a new [tutorial](https://www.hackster.io/karimhamdy1/python-and-c-blended-programming-on-esp32-using-zerynth-ac9a9a) (+ [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OX2IqI76I3o)) on how to run Python + C on a microcontroller. So, no repost, no just marketing stuff. 
Sometimes questions are simple so it's easy to make a searchable sentence . But for complicated parts , I never lose my time in google search input I just try to right down keywords which I think is necessary and just enter ... and in most of the times I can find what I was looking for in first or second page ... or I will learn to make better sentences for my questions in that pages ! (In easy words I will find out more necessary keywords for that question ! )
...plus you have the pure python fallback if you wanted/needed. Not sure how much that matters in python. In grad school I used Matlab where you often wanted to have a pure python fallback from a compiled function
I personally use selenium with chrome driver. It’s pretty painful to learn how to extract data from some sites, and on others it’s a walk in the park. Check out some tutorials and learn!
Yeah, what I did wasn't quite this cool in terms of visualizations, but I did something very much like this *on purpose* - auto-generated daily maps and logs of my whereabouts, and stored them in a shared folder accessible by my attorney at the time, in order to protect myself from false accusations that were potentially going to be thrown at me at the time. This, coupled with things like audio-recording everything, helped put a stop to the bullshit. Fuck privacy.
For future reference, /r/learnpython. &amp;#x200B; I would skip python 2, go straight to 3

JSON is waaaaaaaaay simpler than scraping a website. JSON is basically just dicts and lists. You don't really need any sort of library other than the json module that comes with python...and even then you really only need one line of code: `decoded_data = json.loads(data_from_website)` Done. Once you do that, you have all the data from the website in a very convenient and easy to understand python dictionary or list. `decoded_data` might look like this (using the pprint module that comes with python): ``` &gt;&gt;&gt; pprint(decoded_data) { "id": {CHANNEL_ID}, "kind": "youtube#channel", "etag": etag, "contentDetails": { "relatedPlaylists": { "likes": {LIKES_PLAYLIST_ID}, "favorites": {FAVORITES_PLAYLIST_ID}, "uploads": {UPLOADS_PLAYLIST_ID}, "watchHistory": {WATCHHISTORY_PLAYLIST_ID}, "watchLater": {WATCHLATER_PLAYLIST_ID} }, "googlePlusUserId": string }, } ``` And you'd access something like this: ``` &gt;&gt;&gt; print(decoded_data["contentDetails"]["relatedPlaylists"]["likes"]) 9p8t5werugasoifjhd ```

Python 2 is dead at the end of this year. There is no reason to start with it.
didn't realise there was another , I'll use that for any future Qs. Thanks.
It's not as bad as you'd think. I enjoy it so much it makes me go further.
I tried via pip, I tried pip install, and python -m pip install. I upgraded from 17.10 to 18.04 and still get the same issue. I tried updating gcc but it only went from 7.2 to 7.3 (I think it is at 8.2 but I couldn't get it to install.)

try installing via package manager, like apt or apt-get
Wow, very nice images!!
You're not an asshole. I don't want to hire them.
It doesn't work with apt, as far as I can see. I tried installing all the things in the apt-get on this page, but still no luck, and the page also says to use pip: https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/intro/install.html
Why would anyone want to join your server just to see the download link?
A seg fault is pretty bad. That means you are dealing with something outside of a standard install/error. The first thing you address are your versions. Update everything. Then you start knocking on your kernel door and pop open a few debuggers. post and strace of the install if you can.
[plac](http://micheles.github.io/plac/) is similar
Why doesn't this code throw a \`KeyError\` on line 2? That's what it would do if not for the type annotation.
You should stop using abbreviates like TA and AP. 
haha why
Some solutions, especially algorithms become incredibly similar. How certain are you that you didn't get a false positive? Was this received well by your classmates, your teacher? 
ignore that comment. seriously. 
Less accessible to folks in other countries
The kids use “snap” which is drag and drop programming. To be flagged as incredibly similar, the code needs to be the same and in the same place in the working area (blocks have same coordinates)
Probably not smart including the names of students you caught/accused of cheating in the post 
Because it is confusing. Not evreyone knows the abbreviates.
You're right, the animated gif with the example has names of all his classmates...
Fair enough
Why is the learning platform not doing some basic plagiarism detection to start with? It would be fair if the the people with suspiciously close code where just asked individually to explain certain aspects of how they did the task and why they did things the way they did.
Spare "disk" storage. I like the exposed usb3 to sata||ngff that I can hot swap as needed.
I would head over to Think Geek. They have neat toys in your price range. 🙂

Yup, tried that word for word. Part of me thinks it has something to do with writing the code in PyCharm (I've seen some weird things happen with PyCharm); I'm gonna re-try it with IDLE soon, see if I have any luck then.
I'm not much of an MSSQL guy (far more experience with, say, postgres), but I can think of a couple of things here. Depending on the details of how MSSQL works and/or is configured, you likely have significant overhead associated with individual transactions. If you had infinite rollback buffers, a single transaction that inserted all the data would probably be fastest (vs a transaction per row). I'll assume that you don't, which means that some transaction size which won't exhaust your database buffers but still get a reasonable amount of work done in a "bite" is probably best. The 100k chunk size you're using for Pandas seems like a not unreasonable starting point for that. So, something like: BEGIN WORK INSERT blah (repeat 99,999 times) COMMIT rather than just a series of bare inserts. The transaction semantics may be slightly different for MSSQL, again, that's not my forte per se. This has the additional benefit that it becomes easier to checkpoint your progress, and pick up where you left off due to things like VPN restarts. In terms of how to wrangle your data, I would try to do all of your transforms locally. The inherent overhead of the network latency and database transactional costs are probably significant for this much data. I would iterate through all of your files locally, convert them into the final SQL inserts associated with the rows, and either write out 100k record files of SQL, or just append all the rows to a single file locally, and then loop through that inserting to the remote db in 100k record batches.
Wrote a quick script to interact with Dropbox and rename hundreds of .jpg files based on certain patterns. In most cases, the images are stored in .zip files so the script downloads the zip file, extract images and upload again for renaming. &amp;#x200B;
quick question, where do I find my location history in the google takeout page?

Thanks i'll give this a read! &amp;#x200B;
Fuck me, I didn't hear about pycascades until after it was sold out. Why don't scalpers do this kind of thing?!
Annotating a non-existing key in a dictionary is not an error. You can also annotate a variable that does not exist yet by writing ``` x: int ``` It does not raise `NameError`. However, trying to annotate an item in a *non-existing* dictionary would raise `NameError`.
by "locally" do you mean using pandas? this is where the issue lies, when doing this I'm seriously held back by a) my knowledge b) pandas in general, even when saving down my file after reading it it takes an extremely long time. &amp;#x200B; your post is very insightful, thanks. How would you approach this with Postgres? 
SQL Server Integration Service (SSIS), a data solution tool created by Microsoft that is designed to help with ETL (extract, transform, load) tasks. When I used work in the banking industry and Salesforce, this is what I used to move around hundreds of gigabyte CSVs files each day. Here is the link to the SSIS documentation https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/integration-services/sql-server-integration-services?view=sql-server-2017

Use a fast sorting algorithm to sort it, then use binary search. Linear is as good as it gets for unordered lists. Sorting first is good if you're going to be searching it multiple times too
Thanks, this looks like exactly what I may need. I wanted to keep this purely within Python but I think this might do the trick. Thanks buddy. 
If you can, use a set. Lookup time complexity of O(1) and unordered by definition
I don't know enough about your input data vs your desired output format (well, what you want to insert into the database) to offer concrete details for how I might handle the transformation. If you are able to share either real sample data and intended SQL records to synthesize from them, or fake data which illustrates the data relationships and intended transformation, I'm happy to offer specific suggestions. In the general case, fixing up data present in CSV files and turning it into SQL insert statements is usually pretty straightforward in my experience, and should be doable without pandas, if you find pandas to be limiting you. Again, I can offer specifics if you do. Most of what I said in regards to MSSQL would still be true in the postgres case, assuming that all you have is a socket connection to it. I just have to make certain guesses about performance tradeoffs and default configurations for MSSQL, whereas I know those things more concretely for postgres. If I had access to a local postgres install, or access to the psql command line interface though, I would convert my input CSVs into files 100k records in size containing the transactional blocks (BEGIN WORK/inserts/COMMIT), and then load them in directly from the file using the \i command (see [this documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.2/app-psql.html) if you're interested in the details). I could trivially do this in a loop. This would eliminate much of the overhead involved with ODBC, as well as allow me to separate the network transfer of the data from the database insertion. Programs like filezilla make it easy to resume transfers, so I could just transfer all the SQL files (probably gzip'd) up to the database server, decompress them, and then insert them "locally". If it was a UNIX-based system (the norm for postgres) that also means I could background the process doing the insertion via "nohup", so even if my network connection to the server became lost (or the VPN restarted), the insert would continue to run uninterrupted.
You will need to clarify what you mean when you say "Safe Code" PEP8 is always a good read if you believe that writing clear understandable code is a measure of safety.
You could sort it using a sorting method of your choice. When choosing the sorting method keep in mind what you want to search for and choose your sorting method based on that. Then your search time will be optimal. I’m thinking of way to search an unordered list. I believe there’s an algorithm called a random search but I’ve never used it. Good luck! I’m interested in the other comments here...

A simple schedule program that will send a message to your phone 15 minutes before an appointment. Lots to learn here. 
If you're only going to search it once, sorting it first will be more expensive anyways. If you're only interested in whether an element is present, use a dict or a set instead.

I strongly prefer using pip. It's pretty universal these days, and you can install without admin rights with `pip install --user` I just like minimizing complexity, and pip is pretty close to the Python core. You can even pip install binaries on Windows now, which is pretty slick. 
Are you sure it isn't 59 gigs of whitespace? sheesh.
What are your other hobbies and interests? It's good to cross-pollinate a little to help keep you going. 
You say you've found cheaters i say you've found groups of student that figured out how team work works and do their work together. 
Pip. All conda environments have pip, not all pip environments have conda. Modern versions of python include pip; to get conda, you need a specific python distribution. Requirements files are much more versatile than environment files. Pip is MUCH faster than conda, which takes an age to resolve dependencies. If you're writing an app, conda-forge is much more complicated to deploy to. If you're writing a library, relying on conda is basically "poisonning" all of your downstream users' environments, forcing them to use conda too. There are absolutely some things which conda can do which pip cannot, but unless you know that you are definitely making use of that, I'd stick with pip.
Seconding SSIS as the way to get this done if you can't upload files to the server and use BULK INSERT. I use it at work all the time to import multi-gigabyte data sets to our DB. Create an SSIS package ahead of time that maps the columns and defines the input data types, and then call dtexec (the SSIS command-line package processor) after you've done all your processing in Python and written out your results to a CSV. You can capture the exit code from dtexec to check if the package executed successfully.
Learn your skills by doing projects rather than reading tonnes of books. This way, it’s much more fun, and you instantly get to implement what you’ve learnt. For eg, my first python project was making a Snake Game which I followed from a tutorial. If he said for example, ‘now we are going to use a class’, i will then read and search up about classes to understand them, and then continue with the tutorial. 
Presumably you can find one sample string and regex that produces different outputs. That would help a lot. Ensure your regexes in python are not just strings (e.g. r"myregex" instead of "regex") as that will affect things like backreferences.
Pentesting, but i feel like doing something like a portscanner it's kind of voidless, bc nmap is pretty good at his job xD
Oooh you could try going through some cryptopals exercises in Python! [https://cryptopals.com/](https://cryptopals.com/) Super fun and challenging and enriching. 
Always go with standard and recommended method "pip" on this one, especially if you work with virtual environments a lot.

Appreciate the link pointing to github, a lot of useful information there. Cheers.
HMMMM interesting, i'll definetly gonna check it out that
I don't have a Linux machine set up to test. Maybe try python 3.6.5 instead of python 3.7, that fixed some problems with me in the past. Also send me any console errors and I can try to debug.
Have you looked in to using turbodbc instead of pyodbc? That has native support for numpy data structures so you might see a dramatic speed up by bypassing native python data types.
Do you have to use the (a presumably remote) mssql db? This could probably be much easier / faster to import to a local sqlite or postgres db using their built in methods rather than going through pandas etc. What's the overall objective anyway?
you just need from the point it broke, and then there after. Catch the couple of lines above the line of break as well. It should be the last page or two.
Move historical data from csvs which no one is able to use for analysis and put into sql so anyone across the company can use for powerBI or anything else they wish. My company is behind when it comes to it infrastructure. I'm surprised they let me use python. 
Pip, conda == Microsoft == evil
This man got exposed in numerous comments proving he stole the code, and yet he still boasting as though he wrote it. You seem to not understand the difference between your work and someone else. This is NOT your “first project”.
I've had a nose but the documentation for it was extremely sparse, it was to much for my level to break down and use. 
Python really kind of is one of "data science" languages. There are more, just can't remember. That's not the point though. The point is that scraping really is a good way to get data. Python does this really well. It's also really good at having a simple language to parse through saved data. I'm not sure why theres so much sketchy stuff, but I dont believe that's all of it. I use python to make APIs as well as scrapers. It's all about preference and project. Some people are into keyloggers for whatever reason. I personally am into data. I got into this career path to manipulate, share and collect data (reasonably). So most of my projects have to do with some kind of data.
well, I have a csv of 10,000 regex patterns as strings "\\xoo", etc I'm out of the office atm, so I can't give you a real result. but an example of what I'm talking about is r's use of brackets vs python's backslashes. 1. How can I convert my csv of strings to raw strings? 2. In python's re.sub, what is the different between r'expression' vs 'expression' as the regex argument? 
Do most web scrapers take robots.txt into account?
python is popular with security types for the same reason its popular elsewhere - rapid development of simple stuff
I don't think it's all of it by any means. I use python for all kinds of DevOps tasks. However, I find that these types of things are the majority of the posts here.
This should definitely be possible using pandas. Read files in chunks and write to smaller csvs, then use SQLAlchemy copy_from instead of the to_sql from pandas to write to db.
how is the average scraper any more or less questionable than facebook? zuckerberg is in the uk trying to explain himself to the government again this week, isn't he?
Does this then mean that one cannot mix a codebase that uses type checking with the doc annotations you showed in the example? 
Most people are probably beginners so most of them won't even know robots.txt even exists.
We aren't asking if stealing is better or worse than killing. We are talking about how much "sketchy" stuff shows up in the /r/python subreddit. Take your FB stuff elsewhere, it isn't relevant to this discussion.
Never seen someone so salty over something that affects them in no way whatsoever. Calm tf down it’s a project they made for fun, not something going on their portfolio for potential hirers. And even if it was, what does it matter to you random internet man? No need to get aggressive online just cause you don’t agree with something. I agree he shouldn’t be copying other work but the way he was defending himself he seems either young or just not confident, the way you responded just makes you seem like a dick who wants to look edgy. 
It should be mentioned more in scraping tutorials etc. I feel like a lot of scraping is potentially just stealing content. I know several places I wanted to grab some info from had policies prohibiting it. I'm fairly curious to know if it is a standard practice to check into robots.txt and a websites policies before scraping and using their content. In the case of for-profit projects, is it common for scrapers to ask permission before profiting from the content scraped?
Wow, didn't think I'd get this many responses. Let me add that there is still a lot for me to learn and I am by no means a senior level. I'm mid level at best. Lol. I would think most of them don't. 
Truth!
Right, but I hardly see mention of security as the intent of most of the things posted here. For instance, an instagram like-bot is definitely not security. Hardly any scrapers would be either. Keyloggers could be used for security but are generally used to penetrate security.
I wouldn't know if that's specifically true. Do you know how you could find out... other than the reddit api
What makes you say conda == microsoft?
Why wouldn't you use the reddit API?
I mean I would. Because it's easier. But you could scrape it. 
Right but why would you scrape it?
In case you wanted to for whatever reason. That comes back to that preference thing. Some people are new and dont even know API exist 
Thirding it! 
Ngl I thought you were playing the game until you panned down to show your keyboard so ignore this dick was actually needed thought your project was that you had created your own version of the game, not an auto player.

I think you’ll find much better feedback/answers on stackoverflow.com :) But try to use some native function of the database you are using. Some sort of “to_load()” or “dump”. I know for sure that inserting 1 line after the other it’s very inefficient. 
I'm not sure how useful waiting 5 min between each download is, but there's a `sleep(seconds)` function in the module `time`, which is included in the standard library.
It improve enough?!

It's not `re.sub` specific, it's Python's raw string notation. I cannot find their actual definition in docs, but the rationale for using those in regex is described [here](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/regex.html?highlight=string%20literals#the-backslash-plague)
From my experience, the issue with conda-forge is that the packages you want may require other packages from conda-forge. You may end up with broken packages that don't expect the conda-forge versions, or may be forced to downgrade other packages from the main channel. Some of the issues could have with pip too, but then there's not a lot of advantages of conda-forge if the package is available on PyPI, especially since PyPI is usually the main official channel of distribution for a lot of packages.
I prefer pip for almost every install. If there is something I cannot install using pip I try easy_install and then conda
That breaks the promise that annotations don't change the program behavior. If this is intentional, it is a serious design mistake: &amp;#x200B; \&gt;&gt;&gt; \[0\]\[0\] == 0 or print("really?") True \&gt;&gt;&gt; \[0\]\[0\] : int == 0 or print("really?") really? &amp;#x200B;
Sorry, I don't understand? although 60 gig is a lot, in terms of big data it's very small. I'm sure more experienced data people can move this sort of data with ease. 
Yes. Using sleep() or delay() will work. You can take advantage of multiprocess library and download 2-3 zips together!

It's your attitude in your comments on this shit post. 
I feel super silly asking, but where do I need to look to modify the rotation/movement that's happening? 
How does writing pure python in cython compare to wrapping a python function in the numba jit decorator? Does anyone know the advantages/disadvantages in terms of speed and usability? I understand that cython would save the compilation time for each function (numba would compile each function once at runtime), but are there other benefits to using cython? 
So the fact that I wonder if all the scraping going on is just content theft is a problem? You don't like that I question the motives of sketchy posts on reddit? You don't think that web scrapers should be concerned with content policies on websites? You don't think I have the right to be interested in how these topics are treated by fellow /r/python users? And *I'm* the internet police. You are a silly person.

My guess is people like sharing whatever they learn to do. Also they see other people doing it and that gives them more confidence to do it. Its a vicious circle.
Still is.
&gt;openpyxl Thanks for sharing this. I'm new to Python and although I feel like I'm getting my head around the basics I feel like I'm stalling due to a lack of projects to put together that I can use in the real world. I use a lot of spreadsheets at work that often take a good few hours a week of mucking about with but I've spent an hour with Openpyxl and it's going to really help me out. 
How is it stealing content if it's content that is already public. In the example of zillow or trovit, all their real estate information is already there. It's public and anyone can see it. That's like saying, "you can't gather dead leaves off the ground". That said. Zillow has not detection and blocks bots. That's cool, I don't feel like programming a work around to your captcha. You win. How is me scrapping a real estate site any different than me spending hours going page by page and manually entering it in to a spreadsheet?
Sure you want to check the robots.txt and policies. If the site owners list a lot of restrictions you know they may make scraping difficult and you should build random delays and user agent switches into your code from the start 😀 It is almost always the professional and personal thing to do to contact a site owner before you scrape it. Do I? Sometimes. Depends on the situation. I work in news and build a lot of scrapers. I make a point never to hammer a site. I sometimes ask permission. A lot of times I'm getting government info - it's mine already and I'm mainly scraping it because it's easier or faster than dealing with a records request, or because the agency has tried to fuck me around. The other time IDGAF about permissions is when I built scrapers for event listings. The companies involved in that were mostly built on scraping and aggregating listings. I give zero fucks about returning the favor. What are some examples of 'for profit' ethically questionable scrapers you've seen?
I believe it's a problem with your use of elif. This approach scales poorly. Consider iterating through a dictionary keyed by service with values of price. Also, \*args is a cleaner way to handle the inputs.
I like the way you think
&gt; I believe there’s an algorithm called a random search but I’ve never used it. There is no clever or efficient way to search an unordered list.

It reminds me of the anecdote of a fella who FINALLY made his way into a data science/programming/IT role (paraphrasing) and he was THRILLED to finally peel back the cover and see a gorgeous, flawless interworking of code his new company was built on. But once inside he saw the reality, popsicle sticks held together by deal tape in a massive trembling structure. His job was constant maintenance, debugging, and identifying next steps for the business.

Fetch fake human faces from [here](https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/) try to make multiples requests , store images then make a collage or create completely fake human profiles make an api from it.
Not relevant to the discussion, I won't be replying to you again, goodbye.

I move a lot of data into mssql from dataframes - convert to lists of tuples - depending on amount of columns you can do 5000-25000k per batch without limits on size potentially hitting you. I use ceodbc over pyodbc - from what I remember when I chose it like two years ago - it was faster over inserts of 1MM records.
in the \`main()\` function of each scene (pseudoKleinian.frag, apollonian.frag, etc) , there are "camera", "looat" vectors. you can change them to difrent positions. For example by using &amp;#x200B; vec3 camera = vec3(cos(iTime), 3, sin(iTime)); &amp;#x200B; then you are moving the camera circularlly on the plane y = 3.
I know. I think I’m being silly, I can always pip uninstall them later anyway. I’ll try it out when I get a chance :) 
Do you have an example of this? I'm very interested in how to insert 60gb of dataframes on seconds into a table.
Many websites that provide information of one form or another explicitly state that the content cannot be harvested and used commercially. And it is their legal prerogative to do so and is enforceable in most instances. For your zillow example, their policy states: &gt;You may not utilize Zillow Data or distribute Zillow Data on a mobile app such that Zillow Data is the primary functionality on the mobile app and/or Zillow Data makes up the majority of the content on the mobile app. You may present Zillow Data only on a transactional basis. You will not permit your users to access the Zillow Data in bulk. You may not retain any copies of the Zillow Data. Your license to Zillow Data is limited to making direct server calls to the Zillow API for the Zillow Data and distributing the Zillow Data to your end user(s) on your Site(s), immediately upon receipt by your servers. You may not present the Zillow Data (or permit the Zillow Data to be presented) so that it appears to be available from a third party website. You may not use the Zillow Data for direct marketing (i.e., mailing) or telemarketing lists. You may not separate address information from the Zestimate® or Rent Zestimate valuation for the property at that address or the for-sale or for-rent information, if applicable. You may not separately extract and provide or otherwise use data elements from the Zillow Data to enhance the data files of third parties. So, grabbing a bunch of zillow data with python outside of the API is explicitly forbidden. Copying it by hand and storing it is explicitly forbidden. Grabbing a bunch of data, breaking out what you need from it, and presenting what you need for your own uses is against the policy. Just cause something is accessible to the public doesn't make it free to use however you please. Your anecdotes are bad. Especially your dead leaves example. It's explicitly illegal to go to a public state park and take bags of leaves and bundles of sticks home. Next to zero content available on public television is legal to copy and rebroadcast for anything but personal use, let alone for profit. Same for a lot of website content.
Trying using bcp. Its included with Sql Server. It's the fastest way I know to get flat files into a database. Create a table in sql server that matches your CSV schema, and run something like this: bcp Database.dbo.Table in file1.csv -c -S ServerName -T If you have a ton of files, use python subprocess to automate all of it.
Thank you for your suggestions!!
Thanks! It’s nice to have someone try this out, as I haven’t gotten much response from the r/python community (and my friends/family pretty much don’t even get why I made it). Hope you enjoy it!
My college used the book “Automate the boring stuff” for our python course, others mention that this author skimps through fundamentals but he does offer good chapter video tutorials online. 
First off, assuming you can do this on a DB that is not in active use by other users you should turn off all indexes, foreign keys constraints, triggers, etc. Insert everything and then reindex afterwards. Second, it'll probably be easier to skip sqlalchemy or other Python script. Instead generate and write the SQL insert statements to files and execute those directly.
So basically you'll do what you want regardless of policy or whatever. Moreso if the policy is in the way of what you are trying to accomplish. Ran across some questions a few weeks back about building a real time scraper of craigslist and FB marketplace to create a combo marketplace comprised of the posts from both places.
Shut up Meg
&gt; /tmp/pip-build-_sXoIB no such file or directory 
hey, I tried the same for xml files, it's now accessible on git hub and you can pip it. pip XmlXdiff
Ditto. With this method you don’t necessarily need python. 
Yeah, that doesn't answer anything. Also, it's quite old. I've been using python since before 2.0 was released.
Interesting... in either case I dont care? I'm not selling it or releasing it so I dont really care what they want. If they want it to not be obtainable, hide it.
That's what I expected when I asked. Based on the types of comments I see in scraping posts it feels like most scrapers are not acting in good faith relative to data policies.

Sounds crazy. But pick a project. Maybe an automation project on the raspberry pi. 
File a complaint? Honestly. I've gathered BAGS of leaves from a park for a project and nothing has ever been done. 
Doesn't mean it's allowed or legal. You implied things in public were free for the taking regardless, and I was responding to that.
Im implying that some laws aren't and shouldn't be enforced, because red tape is dumb and doesnt actually protect anyone. 
Check out NAPALM. https://napalm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
But at this point were getting into a political debate about what laws should and shouldn't be written on or enforced. End of the day: dont want me scraping your data, hide it or ban my IPs and hope I'm not a spiteful dick that gets a proxy just to sell your data 
In the case of state parks it's to protect the park and surrounding wildlife. For instance, emerald ash borer makes moving wood and such about a *bad thing*. As for a website, they are spending money to gather, store, sort, and serve the information they have available. Making it public monetizes that information. Someone else monetizing the data they have gathered is like going to the library, copying a book, and republishing it. Not legal or ethical.
Is it fair to say then that you don't think people should be allowed to have a say in what is done with data that is visible to the public?
Like-minded people aren’t always right next to you, but they’re always out there. As long as you value what you do, their opinion shouldn’t bother you too much. I think it’s really neat what you’ve been able to do, and I’ll let you know when I try it out. 
If you put it out there publicly, you did so of your own free will. This is why businesses and the army have levels of clearance for information. If its publicly available then you have no say in what is done with it. I'd be hard pressed to see any judge argue with that (provided I'm not making money off, or releasing it it in the case of another company). For example. Making a pokemon clone and releasing it for the public. Not cool. Making a clone for yourself to do cool things you always wish the games would've, cool. Scraping data for personal use and using it for research. Cool. Scraping to make a website that sells content with a markup, or selling information as your own. Not cool. Pretty clear. My girlfriend has pictures of her tits out there on the internet. Publicly available to all. We dont bitch when guys see them. She and, in a way, I made that decision to put it on the internet. If you dont want data used. Dont make it public. Hide it and encrypt it.
lol, I think this is the standard experience rather than mere anecdote. back to breakpoint debugging through local code running against live databases for me...
Reddit rate limits its API, so if you want “big data”, you can’t use it. People are interested in big data projects because small data personal projects aren’t as impressive/relevant if you are applying to big data companies.
So when the API prohibits pulling the information at the scale wanted, then scrape the content instead?
Corey Schafer has some amazing videos on YouTube too for many Python concepts. Definitely check those out.
Presumably the recordings will end up [on their channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtWI06j1EADmEOGj2iJhSyA) soonish.
I think it’s just people who are learning, wanting to show off there progress. I don’t think there’s anything wrong with that just as much as I don’t think there’s anything wrong for someone positing a highly advanced project. This is a python community not a python masters and not a python noobs community, just a python community. Anyone can post what they want, it’s not like these users are being malicious in anyway on here, just building stuff they think it’s cool. That’s how I learned! I’m sure you learned the same way :) I don’t know if this sounds mean to you op, I’m not trying to have any sass or negativity, I just think this answers your question fairly well.
I’ve seen it done that way, yes. I’m not sure, but it seems the Reddit API is just a courtesy, not an indication of the only data people are allowed to access programmatically from Reddit. Never have done it myself, though. There are other limitations to the API, like you can’t get at a lot of historical data. This is all second hand info. Just trying to think of reasons people don’t necessarily care to use the Reddit API.
https://www.udemy.com/share/1000ikA0EfeVlWR3g=/ I finished this course and this covers pretty much everything about python 3. I believe this is the one you are looking for.
Can you elobaorate please? I'm getting so many conflicting opinions! I've not heard of spark, is this pyspark? 
This is going to be somewhat long, so apologies for the wall of text. Background: I started off as a unix/linux admin myself, and now do security-focused software development full time, and own a [security product company](https://medium.com/cali-dog-security/). I learned to program out of the realization that being able to automate things is an extremely powerful tool to help escape the grips of repetitive minutiae that we experience every day, and that if I could wield that power I could never have to do boring manual tasks ever again (more or less). I was also involved in the infosec community and realized that the best hackers were ones who wrote their own tools. What worked for me wasn't reading many books on the subject, it was just diving in face first and wrestling with it until it did what I wanted it to. They say it takes 10,000 hours to master something, and realize you're at minute one of hour one, and just start building simple things to solve problems you have. --- I also tend to favor languages like Python because it gives me a really good development cycle. I: - press some buttons - things work as expected - I make progress on my project - dopamine is released - happiness - goto: 0 I *don't* like some languages like Java or C because that cycle is I: - push some buttons - stuff explodes with a gibberish message like `note: template bool std::operator==(const std::reverse_iterator&amp;, const std::reverse_iterator&amp;)` - I have to recompile my kernel - I question my choice in careers - I grow a beard looking for the answer to something and one person posts a question with my exact error and a follow up post of "got it figured out" without any explanation of how - I question my choice in careers again - I find the semi-colon that was missing - sadness - goto: 0 --- Basically, always be thinking about ways that you can automate stuff around you, and start very simple (like "I want a program that will go check talk to all our Cisco routers and pull the SNMP info from them and print it out", which can then easily evolve into "I want a program that will email me a summary of our SNMP states across the infra", etc etc). That's really how I started, and really how I learn new things today. After years of practice I tackle much more complicated things with a plethora of tools in my proverbial "tool box", but the process has been, and will remain, basically the same. To give you an idea of what I mean, I didn't know a lick of functional programming before I built [Certstream](https://certstream.calidog.io/]), but my process was what I described above, I just kept reading, learning, and playing until it worked. It's now matured into a crazy service that is used by quite a few people and that ships a **crazy** amount of data out daily ([~10+TB/day](https://i.imgur.com/UthoQnd.png), which as a network engineer might make you cringe a bit :P).

sounds domestic. smart to have proof like that. 0 burden of proof. 
*A lot* of my "legitimate" contract work is based on these kinds of ideas. People often come up with ideas for content aggregation ... which of course involves scraping that perhaps is a little sketchy in many cases. One of them was a "high end yelp" ... so they wanted to scrape NYTimes reviews and the-like ... it's only really illegal if you break the copy-right laws and publish the whole articles you scrape rather than a tiny portion + link and attribution. Another I'm working on involves scraping purchase history from a users' online purchases ... at amazon and the like. Sketchy? I guess at first glance ... but if you know the whole project idea ... not at all.
I built a keylogger.. Im QA and I use it while I test manually. Allows me to always be able to look back at my actions. Sometimes something happens and you forget every single detail or get distracted. Helps a bunch. I want to eventually extend my automation to auto-generate a macro based on it. Special case I know. 
Thanks man now i'm gonna have a long look on how these and the codes i have done will work
That's definitely an important scenario. Do you know if they talked about this process publicly (e.g. blogs or conference talks), or of others like it?
It's a good use case I hadn't considered for one honestly. I spend hobby time woodworking and I have a video recording setup out in the shop. It was the leftovers of some old surveillance systems from work. I don't stream or make youtube videos with it though. 30% of the time I use it to figure out what I did wrong when something get's messed and the other 70% of the time I use it to figure out where the hell I stuck something I can't find.
I wrote one myself that I was questioning of, that reached out to the SEC for a pile of records of certain types of fillings. While it was govt. info, I'm not entirely sure I was supposed to be abusing it that way. Technically I was 'reworking gov data', but...something didn't feel exactly on. &amp;#x200B; Have had my fair share of idiots wanting to scrape their facebook channel to populate their website with, etc.. It's like NOBODY wants to hear you say API.
That's dramatically misleading. The 'python community' is much larger than that.
Everyone is Internet Police. With the power to either upvote, or downvote (or not influence the discussion at all). &amp;#x200B;
Or you see interesting emails, like the one I used to get that showed me: Tables with high identity values. &amp;#x200B; Just think that one through, and then WHY would I need to know...that?
Actually, you know, when I've built scraping/search engines, I tend to use something like Java for the actual scraping, and then Python for the actual analysis. Python certainly makes it easy to get something workable up and running, but bigger systems like Crawler4J and Nutch are much more tailored for the task. &amp;#x200B; If I need something fast, usually wget does the job in recursive mode. &amp;#x200B;
From what I have heard, you are supposed to keep your automations to yourself so that you can reduce your own workload and just produce higher quality results or develop the necessary skills to get a promotion. It also looks great on a resume when applying for outside you company.
very cool &amp;#x200B;
owner me create and delete group (pete (me)) create and delete other - access files
It's great and all. What's wrong with `curl` or `wget`?
The sidebar also mentions "the #python IRC channel on Freenode". In addition, there's also [PySlackers](https://pyslackers.com), which I enjoy.
Been working on a project that breaks down a few authors’ works (for now mark twain, hemingway, and f scott fitzgerald) into sets of words (n-grams) and finds the most frequent sets. For each author I’ve broken their writings into roughly 40,000 sentences. Once i find each author’s unique expressions, the script can infer which author wrote a different sample of writing. Right now it works really well. Probably going to add some more authors of varying styles and time periods to see how well the program holds up. 
My take is that creating a working library on github/pypi is a 'mandatory step' in becoming an established 'python expert'. It looks good on the resume. 
Pulling SEC fillings is kinda the definition of public record. I would feel fine with that - again, those are both legally and morally your records already. I'm surprised they don't offer an FTP download. What didn't feel OK to you? Facebook only offers an API until they can corner whatever vertical they're in, then they kill it or monitize it. FB is the enemy of the web. 
Did you get an error message?
Nope, no error message at all. It would be as if no message was sent to the bot at all. Regular CommandHandler would work, but as soon as I would try something with an argument, it wouldn't respond. 
I'm just taking some small projects I made for calculating and making one big python calculator, nothing too fancy.
What do you mean policy? When it comes to public records and freedom of information I'm pretty close to an absolutest. I'll make an effort to be courteous with government agencies because I'm not an asshole and I'd rather not waste time on lawsuits, but I have zero tolerance for BS. With private organizations, I'm a bit more nuanced. I made sure the local performing arts center knows I scrape their events listings once every couple of days. Same with a dozen or so other venues that don't really manage their own sites (WordPress built by contractor mostly. They can't spell API). None of them would know the difference is I hadn't. I would probably be fine with scraping anything from FB because they're evil, and Craigslist because I've got a personal grudge, but the point is that I don't do whatever I want, I make a decision about the ethics.

Do you mean the default library that everyone uses? If so, then this is pretty unlikely. If you just mean you would like to add to the built-ins on your computer, I don’t believe you can. There is the PYTHONSTARTUP environmental variable [docs](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html) where you can define custom functions but it looks like it only runs when you open python in interactive mode. Tailoring this kind of thing just makes your scripts less portable, and importing things only takes one line, so I don’t advise doing this. 
&gt;ebbrowser. You could add threading to d How would i add threading? is that a module i import ?
I don't think you want to install anything into python itself. I expect you just want to put the import into your __init__.py if you're writing a module or utilise the python environment variable [PYTHONSTARTUP](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#envvar-PYTHONSTARTUP) for an interactive session.
Integer overflow maybe? 
+1 for the "included" solution. Python is billed as "batteries included" and I think a package repo falls under that. 
Pretty printing? Although it’s still only about 3 lines (4 with the interpreter directive).

Think why this exists. Think what kind of community Python has, that allows this to exist in the standard library. Java would not tolerate it. C++ would not tolerate it. Think about the sort of people that community helps to attract. Hobbyists, non-developers, mathematicians, VFX people. Most people here don't realise how much Python is used inside VFX. Realise why there are so many hobby projects in /r/python. Go to a makerlab or hackspace. They're all using Python and C. Realise why web scrapers are good projects for learners and why there are so many "not serious professional developers" here. 
Professional development and python have a very large intersection these days.
Pretty sure it will be up on the YouTube channel.
I am writing a bunch of code mainly in numpy, but most of the library should already be as fast as C, right? Where would the main advantage be in interfacing it with cython, is it in the dynamic typing etc. or also inside the functions doing the big computations?

&gt;it is their legal prerogative to do so and is enforceable in most instances. INAL, but I'm pretty sure you're contentions are either mistaken or irrelevant. There have been a number of cases over this ground. A site's TOS doesn't carry much if any weight in law to date. In the federal 9th circuit court of appeals right now LinkedIn is trying to get permission to sue some company that's been scraping them. LinkedIn is trying to say that by totally ignoring the TOS the scraper is breaking the CFAA. The reason it's at the appellate level is because the trial court judge shot it down. It's been heard by a three judge panel but no decision yet. From what I've read the judges who heard it were pretty skeptical of LinkedIn's position. A decision in LinkedIn's favor will break with at least two earlier cases I'm familiar with and several others that I've heard of but don't know well. I don't like their chances, unless they can just outspend the other company into a settlement. &gt;Next to zero content available on public television is legal to copy and rebroadcast for anything but personal use, let alone for profit. Same for a lot of website content. Yeah, except under U.S. law data is not copyrightable. Copyright lawyers call it 'database rights' IIRC, and it's black-letter law that there are none in the U.S. The EU is different and I don't know the law there well, but in the U.S. the TV analogy is almost as bad as the raking up leaves from the national forest analogy.
Sorry for the crosspost, just really honestly proud of this one. This is my own implementation in python based on the implementation in ruby in the book [Mazes for Programmers](https://pragprog.com/book/jbmaze/mazes-for-programmers). Excellent book. Strongly recommended. Here is the ugly [sourcecode](https://github.com/tetrismegistus/minutia/tree/master/exercises/mazesforprogrammers).
Thank you! Now I know to do this in the future!
Yes. It's called `threading`. First step is making it work sequentially. Then show us the code and we'll help you add threading. 
Beautiful!
Where?
What ever it is, its deep. Try a different version. then try a source install.
Thanks! Have free comment karma!
It's insane how clear the structure of the maze became with the gradient. I'm seriously amazed.
Google crawls millions of websites. Is someone at Google finding and reading the policy page of each website beforehand? We both know the answer is No. Why is it okay for Google to crawl and profit from data on the web, but for some reason it's not okay for people here on this subreddit? 
I have a project that make gif aniamtions of maze algorithms in only a few seconds, see \[here\]([https://github.com/neozhaoliang/pywonderland/tree/master/src/gifmaze](https://github.com/neozhaoliang/pywonderland/tree/master/src/gifmaze))
Reality disagrees. A quick google shows that: * FB won a suit in 2009 against someone scraping their site to make an aggregated social media site * Ebay won back in the early 2000s against scraping their site to make a "better ebay" * Auernheimer was convicted in 2012 for scraping email addresses off of AT&amp;Ts website * Meltwater lost against AP in 2013 * Robocog was fined $40k when linkedin fined them for scraping * BoardFirst, LLC lost against Southwest Airlines when they scraped ticketing content to find lower ticket fares All of which won due to ToS contents or copyright claim to the way in which the data was arranged or aggregated on the suing site.
Cython makes it a lot easier to use numpy arrays with other c libraries, and vice versa. Doing that manually, and safely, is definitely not for the beginner. Cython makes it much more approachable, and does so with many automated safety checks. Sure, hand writing it might result in slightly faster code, but cython gets to really far with much less effort.
I have to admit that while researching solutions to translating from a language I don't know to a language I do, I came across your github more than once. I admit I even peeked at the source code once before I finished the code I shared here. But I solemnly swear I copied none of it. Thank you so much for your fine implementation and I will be learning from your code more directly when I go to find optimization strategies. My implementation is slooooow.
Crawling has been treated as a distinct act from scraping in all the instances I've been able to find.
I've used this channel quite a bit over the years. It is very good. They will often point you at a more specific channel based on your question. IRC is also an open protocol and freenode is a non-profit running on open source software. So, while it lacks many of the features of slack, it is truly open. 
You too
Oh, when I began coding maze animations I also used the "save pngs" + "convert gif" approach, your program reminds me the experience as a beginner in python learning maze algorithms, ... I mean no offense here, just let you know there is more efficeint way for making maze aniamtions in python. anyway your are on the right track to exploring the fun of python.
Neat! Quick recommendation though, it's always easier to share code through a service like GitHub/GitLab or similar, it makes both running whatever you have simpler than downloading from OneDrive, and greatly increases your project's visibility. 
No offense taken! I appreciate you making your example available. 
Two Numberphile vids on the subject: Dijkstra: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GazC3A4OQTE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GazC3A4OQTE) A\* (an improvement): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySN5Wnu88nE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySN5Wnu88nE)
Picked and implemented a project from this giant list: [https://github.com/karan/Projects#web](https://github.com/karan/Projects#web) which was fetch current weather. I used a geolocation api to get coordinates of any location. These coordinates where then used in a weather api to get current weather condition at that location. This week I will be working with twitter api. Specifically, I want to get some number of tweets based on some hashtag or get a list of currently trending hashtags.
Small feedback on the visualization: I’d recommend against using white in your gradient, since that’s the background color you used in your maze. And you should have the gif stay on the final result for a second or two at the end. 
Added to my todos, thanks. Changing the color to RGB walk was on my list as well.
Huh? SSIS is dead? Where did you get that idea from? I have helped with so many companies with SQL Server data migration, I can certainly tell you that SSIS is not going away anytime soon. And by the way, Spark and SSIS serve very different purpose and target consumers. 
SSIS is dead by the fact of exactly what I said, my job full time is to migrate people off it. It’s way too expensive compared to open source software and typically much slower. Companies pay us millions to move them off it. 
I would add that if you’re writing a public library, then making an API that is hard to misuse is another important facet of safety. This isn’t a topic unique to python though. I recently wrote a blog post that dives deeper into the area exposed by the pyyaml safe_load tip from that Hackernoon article: https://www.serendipidata.com/posts/safe-api-design-and-pyyaml
Just because your full time job is migrating off SSIS t9 Spark that does not mean SSIS is dead. That's like saying I'm a consultant helping companies migrate their Oracle database to something else, and now Oracle is dead.
very cool!!
I agree, but it’s not just me. its an industry trend for sure. The math just makes sense and Spark is just much easier to use and the skill set of Spark (Scala and python) is growing much faster than SSIS. It is not dead, but is dying by virtue is being replaced. It will be around for forever just like we have cobalt and FORTRAN still in many orgs. 
+1, working with JSON is less tricky than it may seem. It’s just a way of turning a dict into a text file, or vice versa. It will be considerably less work than writing a customer HTML parser with bs4, and also probably less likely to randomly change shape on you.

You think? I feel greedy already posting to two subs. Like if I dig too deep, then a balrog will kill me.
You know, just like Matlab. That's a thing right?
While technically this is Dijkstra's algorithm, no heuristic function seems to have been used so this is equivalent to a breadth-first search. It would be possible to add a heuristic though and use the full potential of dijkstra's by adding an "exit" to the maze though. Cool nonetheless.

Nice!!
Spark is an amazing open source technology and there is no question about it, but at the end it is an open source technology. I don't argue the growing trend of Spark, but Microsoft invested way too much time and money on SSIS to let fade away and SSIS is so integrated with Microsoft eco system. If I'm work with big data warehouse like Hadoop, then yes it make sense to use Spark or other similar open source ETL tool, but if I'm working with SQL Server or Azure, SSIS will be my first choice. Just a personal opinion from experience working with data too much everyday. One thing I really wish is Spark will refine their documentation.
Thanks!
I get what you’re saying, but all of my work is on Azure and 85% of our clients are using Azure SQL. And actually, Microsoft is also investing into Spark a LOT. Spark integrates so well with Azure SQL and Databricks is an amazing closed source alternative with support. I still think Microsoft makes the best RDBMS. I get what you’re saying, but really the only reason a company would go to SSIS over Spark or other tooling is because they have a team of elderly Microsoft-only stack engineers that want to hold on to that and that is absolutely a good reason. 
Broken link. Here's another (for the moment): [tailrec](https://github.com/nayyarv/python-tailrec)
This sub is too nice.. nobody's going to mention his "it guru" username, or pointing out that he's an engineer, like all engineers like to do xD too nice, too nice
yeah, I reported it as a bug on the ubuntu bug reporting page. If gcc crashes, then you really have a problem! Other issues can be worked around sometimes, but a GCC segfault? Probably not. 
If you're bulk loading 60GB of csv files (and 60GB is pretty bulky), then best use the bulk load utility built for exactly that purpose, namely "[bcp](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/tools/bcp-utility)". You can use SSIS instead if you wish, but that's more complicated. You may want to use python to clean the file first: import csv # convert the source file to utf-16 and clean # change utf-8 to the encoding of the source file as necessary with open('myfile.txt', 'rt', encoding='utf-8', errors='replace', newline='') as rf, \ open('clean_file.txt', 'wt', encoding='utf-16-le', errors='replace', newline='') as wf: # add other csv parameters as necessary # (https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#dialects-and-formatting-parameters) reader = csv.reader(rf, delimiter=',') for row in reader: wf.write('\t'.join(f.strip() for f in row)) wf.write('\n') # then run the following from the command line: # (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/tools/bcp-utility) # bcp MYTABLE in 'clean_file.txt' -w -m 1 -S MYSERVER -T If you really want to use pyodbc, then don't use pandas or sqlalchemy as well. Just make sure you set fast_executemany to True (see https://github.com/mkleehammer/pyodbc/wiki/Cursor#executemanysql-params-with-fast_executemanytrue). Doing it this way, you'll be holding all that data in memory though so you may have to load it in chunks.
Amazing 
How much was your tuition for that course?
~$300 for a 16 week course at a JC 
Not bad, if it was a regular college tuition cost I would have raised hell with them.`
Use "for row in reader:" instead of "for row in roads:".
To be fair I had a very good instructor, the book itself is maybe $16 on Amazon last I checked but my prof had a PhD in CS and was passionate about teaching so that made this a pretty easy first scripting language for me. If you’re self motivated (unlike me) you could very well pick this up and teach yourself.

Is it just me or does it not solve the maze?
Looks cool, but isn't there a built-in way to beautify Jason in Pyhton? `python -m json.tool`
Yea of course but from my point of view the application was for practicing urwid and how to use the widgets, signals, etc..
It has reached out and touched me. Not unlike the mid-twenty something guy with a pool who lived across the street from my best friend's house when I was 6.
While you are correct that this application is equivalent to a breadth-first search; the distinction between traditional BFS and dijkstra's is that dijkstra's accounts for weighted edges where-as BFS merely optimizes for least number of edges. Adding a heuristic to this would make it A\* instead of Dijkstras [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A\*\_search\_algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm)
**A* search algorithm** In computer science, A* (pronounced "A star") is a computer algorithm that is widely used in pathfinding and graph traversal, which is the process of finding a path between multiple points, called "nodes". It enjoys widespread use due to its performance and accuracy. However, in practical travel-routing systems, it is generally outperformed by algorithms which can pre-process the graph to attain better performance, although other work has found A* to be superior to other approaches.Peter Hart, Nils Nilsson and Bertram Raphael of Stanford Research Institute (now SRI International) first published the algorithm in 1968. It can be seen as an extension of Edsger Dijkstra's 1959 algorithm. *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Python/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28
I think you're confusing Dijkstra's algorithm with A\* which does in fact use a heuristic (estimate distance to goal). Djikstra is essentially an unguided search using a heuristic of 0 for every node. You're right that this is a breadth-first search. When all the possible moves have the same cost (or weight), Dijkstra is BFS.
Ah thank you for correcting that, I completely messed up the distinction and had A* and dijkstra's switched around in my head somehow.
It does solve how to get from any point in the maze to the start point. In the graphic you see the colours darken the further you get from the start. If you were to start at any point in the maze you could get to the start by moving to the lightest coloured square adjacent to the current one. More concretely instead of colours the algorithm computes the smallest cost of getting to the start point.
Yes. For every variable, there can be only a single annotation. Unless you figure out a way of grouping them, something akin to [typing.Union]([https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Union]. However, I am not sure how that would work in practice.
They will be streamed tomorrow as well. The schedule should be posted between talks
Can someone eli5 the dijsktra algo used in the routing protocol OSPF ? Just got my ccna I'm supposed to know this shit
Implement it yourself??? The code is even given on that site: &gt; Roughly equivalent to: &gt; &gt; sqrt(sum((px - qx) ** 2.0 for px, qx in zip(p, q)))
Of course I can do that, but that is the python version. math.dist is being calculated at a much lower level. See [https://bugs.python.org/issue33089](https://bugs.python.org/issue33089) I want to use the lower level implementation.
Ah thanks, for whatever reason I was looking into stdlib rather than language reference.
I've done a small linear circuit analysis toolbox (sounds harder than it is) as my first bigger project, which was a lot of fun

why don't you upgrade to 3.8?
Sounds interesting will look in that. Thanks 
Thanks a lot!! 
That's brilliant but why does the maze have NO ESCAPE! 
Pure Python is expected to be memory-safe. The interpreter does not allow operations that corrupt Python's own memory - for example, list access is bounds-checked, and a reference to an object will keep that object alive through reference counting so will never [dangle](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dangling_pointer). The only issues are bugs in the interpreter or native extensions, or use of libraries that circumvent safety (eg. ctypes, cffi).
Desktop link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dangling_pointer *** ^^/r/HelperBot_ ^^Downvote ^^to ^^remove. ^^Counter: ^^240563
**Dangling pointer** Dangling pointers and wild pointers in computer programming are pointers that do not point to a valid object of the appropriate type. These are special cases of memory safety violations. More generally, dangling references and wild references are references that do not resolve to a valid destination, and include such phenomena as link rot on the internet. Dangling pointers arise during object destruction, when an object that has an incoming reference is deleted or deallocated, without modifying the value of the pointer, so that the pointer still points to the memory location of the deallocated memory. *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Python/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28

If you have programmed in java for some years, then you are not a beginner at all. So stop looking for beginner resources. Maybe you should start with the official docs. As far as MOOCs are concerned, they are mostly beginner friendly and are there just to get you into the groove. Now to get you into the groove, you scratch the surface of each and every concept. But if you dig deeper, the course will be branded boring, tough and stupid. Regarding the book you mentioned, I never heard about it so no comments. I would advice you to check it out. It's quite possible that you will find it engaging. Also check it out. You will surely find something great here: https://www.quora.com/What-are-good-books-on-advanced-topics-in-Python
