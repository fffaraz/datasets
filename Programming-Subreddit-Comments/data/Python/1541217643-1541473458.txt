Flask is definitely easier, but I guess it depends on what you're doing.
Same as Django. That's why you use something like uWSGI or Gunicorn. It's just there just for testing.
Super cool! Next do a youtube video on 'Website from scratch in 10 hours using flask!'
I don’t feel like I’m qualified to do that one. :)
No, the setup code (the argument to `-s`) is only run once; the statements after that are what is timed. If you time the imports as well, I imagine numpy would lose out even more, just for sheer size - although imported modules are cached, and I'm not sure how that interacts, so it might effectively only be run once *anyway*.
You made the website didn't you? That is qualification enough to me :)
Love the website. Congrats on a big accomplishment. One note however, and it's a nit really. Maybe when the user scrolls down the page you should increase the opacity of the header bar because the text behind it can make the header bar text hard to read.
Pretty sure you installed to to the wrong place, I believe you need to use `pip3`.

Yes. The beauty of python has always been its generalization of methods. That's always created a lot of power. Being able to pass a function to a function, for example, allows one to toolchain ridiculous things that aren't possible in several other languages. Being able to pass arguments to a function that are not in order allows you to specify defaults so that a new user doesn't have to understand every single argument in a function, and can just get on with new tests quickly. The easiest example of dynamic typing that has been broken in recent years is with numpy indexing. If you have a numpy array, say, thisarray = (numpy.arange(10)\*2)/2 # = 1,2,3,..,10 then it will give an error if used as an index because it is not an integer. (For example, newarray = thisarray\[thisarray\] does not work! But newarray = thisarray\[thisarray.astype([numpy.int](https://numpy.int)) does....) This is a huge step backwards, complicating factor, makes very ugly code, breaks all sorts of older useful libraries, and type checking \*adds nothing of value here\*. Even when passing something to a function, I might do a type check to see what is being passed. For example def thisfunction(thisinput = None): if thisinput == None: setdefaults() elif type(thisinput) == str: setotherthings(thisinput) &amp;#x200B; The concept of None has always been very useful. I very dearly hope that the move to static typing slows down because I like generalizing code. It's what Python has always been good at. It's what's made it unique. I understand that it makes moving to working with other languages easier to have static typing, but in the process, it will make it harder for new users to move into it. I see functions here and there being lost to increased complexity, breaking some very large projects. The goal should be to reduce the amount of user inputs and typing, not increase it. 
Second what @sullyj3 said.
Death by firing squad.
What do you mean by support? What kind of package are you thinking about? Consuming APIs? HTTP2 servers?
Maybe not imgur -- you could try hosting static files on AWS S3. https://flask-s3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
I found they Spyder IDE to be a nice balance for prototyping. Not perfect though.
The Python interpreter requires consistent indentation, either tabs across the board, or spaces across the board. Even if you use spaces, the indentation width has to be fixed at n spaces throughout. The default is 4 spaces. You can set up your text editor to use smart tabs, that behave like tabs, but is spaces in the file.
try to run python (which the now reinstalled) without virtualenvs
Try to assign in a cell 5 to y, run it then delete it. Or do not delete it but rewrite the cell with some other code
Django’s scaffolding is certainly nice, but for people that disagree or simply don’t care for its opinions the process can be overwhelming fighting against the framework every step of the way. I’ve found that Flask gives you enough to autopilot the tough stuff but gets out of your way whenever you need a fundamental change in how things work. Overall, though I might lean towards Django for simple projects, I think it’s pretty disingenuous to compare the time it takes to scaffold a Django project to the time it takes to build your own fully custom website. A more equal comparison might be Django’s startproject command versus a git checkout of one of the many bootstrapped Flask projects. 
It's not PHP. There are more PHP developers than Python developers; makes it easy with regards to hiring.
modules which have prfix "\_" is compiled with python - no?
tabs provide flexibility for each code reviewer/writer to reformat the code to what’s best for them by simply using :set ts=4 but tabs are often mixed with spaces which completely breaks the readability. thus using spaces exclusively usually makes code more readable 
I’ve seen your potato game nice 
Django is easier and is more popular
+1 for flask for simple shit. Sometimes you don't need the batteries that are included with Django.
It's PEP8 standard to use spaces instead of tabs because they render properly while tabs render different on other platforms, for example your 2 spaces tab can be converted to 4 spaces or something. That's why Python uses spaces instead of tabs. But you can always turn tabs into spaces, I do that. 
After trying both, I'd argue that Django is probably easier if you want to make a large project with lots of the features it provides. However, Flask is absolutely easier to get started. It took me awhile to get a site working at all with Django just because there are so many files and parts that work together. With Flask, it's like 4 lines of Python in one file and bam, you have a working website.

I recently ran a flask app a top is wsgi/Apache within docker/k8. It auto-scaled up and down to serve thousands of people. Took me all of about 30 minutes to create...cannot scale, yeah right
I started with codecademy and then automate the boring stuff. Nothing special, I got data sets off kaggle and started tearing through documentation for things like pandas and scikit learn.
&gt; I really love how it is basically just pure logical thinking and processes TBH this is far from what I like most about coding I like the result when I finish a project, because it does something useful I guess it's a matter of attitude
Great advice, and also happy cake day!
How and where did you deploy it if I may ask?
What was the test/project, in general terms?
Plan little projects. Make it happen. Read codes online. The more you practice, the more you tinker, the better you get. You don't have to play safe in learning phase. Try, make mistakes. The more mistakes you make, the m more you learn how to fix them. So, just try. Practice a lot of programs. Think of little project ideas, make them happen. You got this! 👍
There are 6 other people in my department and I very much doubt I will be the most experienced programmer. I think I got hired for skills that aren't necessarily my coding abilities, but more so that my coding skills were good enough. Thanks for the advice though, I'm looking forward to learning more on the job. 
could you give me an example of a project? i really appreciate the kind words!
Imagine this simple block of code: while a &lt; 15: print(a, end=' ') if a == 10: print("made it to ten!!") a = a + 1 print() What happens if you need to add another while loop to wrap the entire outer loop? In most editors if I bulk select the current loop and hit the tab key - the entire block of code gets indented to the right. If I delete the outer loop, I can move the code block back to the left by hitting shift-tab. The problem with the space - if you tried the same thing it will simply replace the entire codeblock with a space ... essentially deleting it. Thus, tab is easier to use than a space in every IDE I've ever had to use. Not sure if the common Python IDE's are this way, but that is why I use tabs over spaces.
There's some good introductory stuff at https://codeclubprojects.org/en-GB/python/ - are those simple enough / too simple?
Nice, thanks for the info and congrats!
thank you, thats an awesome library
The theory goes that spaces are consistently rendered in all code editors, whereas tabs are in more of a free-for-all situation. Some people reading the code may discover that their editor messes up the visual layout because of that. Now I am not sure how often that comes up nowadays, but using spaces doesn't require much effort, and it's nice to be nice to people, so in PEP8 it became the recommended option. Another practical concern is that spaces are the standard elsewhere. That means that if you copy to or from your codebase and some other project, you're introducing a necessary extra step of converting whitespace. Remember that Py3, as well as Py2 with an optional flag, will throw an error if you mix the two, so you HAVE to do the converting. Ultimately, it's a style thing, so there should be no major technical issues - just some irritated maintainers (you included, possibly).

Did you use Jupyter notebook to present the results? Or just copy-paste figures into a Word or Powerpoint?
I would take your comment seriously if you show proof that you are a Cloudflare employee
Both! Kinda. They wanted me to include the code I used but present the findings as a report in a word doc.

Use the quantum random module it uses an API for a service that gets real random numbers.
Everybody has to start somewhere. The trick is to be able to learn even if you have no peers, and we have the internet to help in that case - Stackoverflow, reddit, open source, etc. Also IRC as well. I'd say probably 90% of my knowledge came from the internet even before I got anything remotely resembling "real" developer job. The OP's new outfit sounds like they are not in the software engineering line of business, and in those cases, it really comes down to individual preference: do they want to be a big fish in a little pond or a little fish in big pond? IMO - It definitely helps to have both in your career, but even when I do "tick-tock" job progression, I'm not always among peers (I do a lot of solo or small group consulting). But even with that, what I like to do is a few years doing "I'm learning something completely new until I learn it" and then move on to applying that as a SME somewhere new, then getting bored with being the SME in that area for that company and going to find something new to pick up.
No one in the "spaces" side of this debate actually means that you should use space bar for indenting your code. Any decent text editor can insert the required number of spaces when you hit tab key. In the case you've described above I would do exactly as you did: select the block of code and hit Tab. My editor would properly indent the code with 4 spaces.
For future reference: https://python-docx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/quickstart.html#adding-a-picture
Why all the downvote hate? Wow.
You are confusing the keys hit on your keyboard with the characters that are put in the text file. Deciding between tabs versus spaces means setting the correct option in your IDE. You work exactly the same with both - indentation is created with the [tab] key on the keyboard. There is a big chance that you use spaces already since it's the default option in many (but definitely not all) IDEs. For Python it is essential to be consistent and since there is usually not than one person working on a code (even if not initially then possibly some day) one should use the standard - which is 4 spaces.
tabs and spaces are both characters and physical keys. the tabs vs spaces debate is not about the key. it is about the character used for formatting. IDEs and editors convert the tab key to the character of your choosing
Could you share/open source the python code?
Mr negative
from: https://github.com/jsvine/pdfplumber Returns a version of the page with only the .objects for which test_function(obj) returns True. --&gt; you should return True/False, not the Object or '': page.filter(lambda x: filter_func(x)) or even simpler: page.filter(filter_func)
That sounds sustainable (even if this amount of traffic subsists): 0.25%/(2h)*24h/day*30day/month=90%/month Anyway, your website looks good!
All the cloudflare protection features are optional and can be fully turned off, you can just use it as a free dumb CDN/cache.
&gt; I noticed all the bootcamps are JavaScript development instead of Python C++ Java etc I wouldn't worry too much about language for an entry level position. The important thing is understanding the concepts, and knowing how to take a problem, break it down and code up a solution, and you can do that in any language. And frankly, languages change so often that it isn't worth getting too attached to one. I'm of the opinion that if you can solve a problem in one language and you know how to read documentation, you can solve a problem in any language. &gt; I’m unaware of there are other bootcamps for preparation into say the video game industry. There are degrees tailored specifically for the gaming industry. I don't work in this industry myself, but I have a few friends that do. From what they've told me, a degree is important for getting past initial screening and a good portfolio of games out there in the wild will seriously help getting to the interview stage.
Thanks! I mean that I’m paying for a Linode server. I think that Flask on its own is good enough for what I’m. It took ~2 hours to code everything. (tons of time trying to fix CSS though) I just have to send the server text files and it’ll add posts. You can’t see it yet as there are only 3 posts, but the blog is split into pages with navigation too.
I bought one on Linode (technically renting).
I didn’t intend to share the code since it’s very disorganized and is mostly just a bunch of `app.route`s (it still handles blog posts and game dynamically though) I was writing the stuff very quickly because I have a lot of stuff to do this weekend. CSS itself ended up being a pain though. That was about 4 hours of it not doing what I wanted. :P
This way works: ``` CFLAGS="-I$(xcrun --show-sdk-path)/usr/include" pyenv install 3.7.0 ``` Ref: &gt; https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/issues/108#issuecomment-359161050

Mr quick on slapping labels
Yea thats what I want to see, the dynamic blog part
Really nice, congratulation. How did you deploy flask? Ngnix gunicorn?
What plan did you take? The cheapest one?
Congrats to you! Neat work
Make sure there are no trailing spaces on the line where you're using the '\' character. It needs to be the last character on the line.
Congrats! I would suggest to deploy an SSL cert. You could use Let's Encrypt (which is free!) :)
I think I do recommend PyQT over Tkinter, keeping in mind that Tkinter may be simpler for quick stuff, or maybe distribution since it comes with Python (I'm about to deal with distribution, so we'll see how that goes with PyQT). With PyQT I designed most of the GUI with the provided Qt designer. I have some dynamic elements that are created on user request that I wrote directly in code. When I started with Tkinter I did write it all, so the PyQT designer did make it easier. I am not sure what you mean with "switching between frames", but maybe the tab widget can help?
Hi. Welcome to the world of Python. 
Without the code we can only guess. I'm guessing you forgot about something. 
o_O. Flask’s built in web server isn’t used for production. Use nginx or gunicorn, or apache, or literally any other web server. 
Happy cake day!
That's awesome
Yep, I taught myself electrical engineering (and landed a job) using only the internet as my peers. Just takes motivation!
if __name__ == "__main__" is awkward syntax. Anonymous function syntax (lambda) is verbose, and single-line-only. Lack of tail-call optimization. Lack of implicit return. Awkward class creation syntax would have been at the top of my list, but it was fixed in 3.7 with dataclasses.
Did you ever get started? Otherwise try out [Experience Coding](http://experiencecoding.com/), it'll have you actually writing code right away.
Nice games btw!
Pedantic, but Python isn't to thank, you need to thank yourself. Being a software engineer is about critical thinking and logic, You can translate that to any language. Good work, and again, at that salary don't be afraid to jump ship if something feels rocky or off. 
As far as I can see OP wants a HTTP/2 compatible client (like `requests`) to consume APIs and services that support (or even only support) HTTP/2
I've heard about people developing strong attachment to trees, even some inanimate objects, but 8-bit sequences? Why do you care so much if it's one character or another? In most editors you cannot even see which one is being used. In better editors, you never indent by typing the text needed for indentation. For instance, if I'm using an Emacs of another programmer, I wouldn't even know what is written into source file, I'd just press `TAB`, and whatever that means for the editor would get inserted into the source file. Which is usually regulated by some project conventions, completely automatically w/o my knowledge.
I didn't downvote you, but generally, people tend to downvote when they see posts with factually incorrect statements - and your post was built around such statement (even though it was out of ignorance and not malice). I don't think it has to be "hate". It's often a warning to others "don't trust this information". 
Awesome, great job!
 * Java is required for interoperability. They build clients and servers. Corporations pay for java support and it gets funding. Java has both server frameworks, like tomcat, and browser clients. * Go is written by google, I’d be very surprised if it didn’t have a h2 library, considering google is one of the major authors to h2 * Apple has to develop h2 compatibility for its operating system, and client libraries, which are written in obj-c and swift, so it’s not a large leap to expose that interface to users. They require it for building safari, and ui elements that use http, like iTunes. Now python isn’t really a server library. It doesn’t have good concurrency, so the benefits of h2 are kind of moot. Typically you’ll have something like nginx or Apache serving websites which are written in native c, fast and efficient, which then deliver &lt;insert Lang here&gt; websites. For the client it doesn’t really make sense, There’s no python browsers. I can’t think of an application that needs the benefits of h2, where you could just use your standard url lib. So there really isn’t a need for an http2 framework, which is why it doesn’t really exist. 
Was kind of hoping 'all thanks to python' meant you wrote a script to apply to jobs. 
Take a look at the [concurrent.futures](https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html) builtin module. It's a high level module for launching Threads and Processes. Processes is the one you want. Includes great examples too.
Instead of me telling let this guy, he goes really in depth and explains what everything does as he does it. It's a 12-part series so it's quite long but it's definitially worth the watch!

Nginx uWSGI for me.
Yeah, I was looking at that.
Be careful. Interviews are two-way, and I his robbed you of a chance to get a feel for them.
Would you be willing to post the project questions? I could use the practice.
Mostly reddit and stackexchange. Electronics became my hobby and a few years later I was good enough to get a job building hardware. I already had ten years experience with Python though, which also helped.
congrats
Good Luck!
Congrats bro! Its a great motivation for me. I am 20 and broke. I am depressed due to my financial situation and the negativity surrounding me but i want to break things. Your story is the absolute role model for me. Heartiest congrats again. :)
You need to authenticate to your proxy. Unfortunately there's dozens of different methods depending on which proxy it is. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/407 You need to read up on how to authenticate too your particular proxy.

Fyi, that's a fairly low starting salary for a software engineer, at least where I live. For example my company's nation-wide minimum salary for fresh grads is $85k and is higher in several metros. You may want to shop around more if this is your first offer.
How do render markdown?
Honestly the Math major is prob the key to your success here. I have a lib arts degree and attempting to get into the data field is quite hard, even tho my python skills are quite good. If anyones younger and reading this-- DONT GET A LIBERAL ARTS DEGREE
I don’t use markdown. I use something I call fluffdown. It’s pretty similar to markdown, but also has some differences. Image embeds would be $image_url$ and links would be |link_url|shown_text| among other things. I wrote a script to convert it to HTML.
I'm learning Python as well. If you don't mind, would you help me out by letting me know how you went through your journey, and what you learnt? Please do either reply here or PM me. Thank you in advance. 
Linux: python [script.py](https://script.py) OR ./script.py if you have a shebang Windows: py script.py
Should also add, it’s on mac
I wish Python had something like [Rmarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/). It's purely awesome to make interactive HTML analyses with it. You can also export to the word with it. If you are interested you can make Python chunks and then just import/plot results in R to create exported markdown document with it.
[TIL](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix) ) &gt;In computing, a shebang is the character sequence consisting of the characters number sign and exclamation mark (#!) at the beginning of a script.
Wordpress, bruh
my comment was about the environment OP will have to work in, not about OP's success
Where do you host it? I want to learn, but gitlab pages isn’t effective...does your host let you have SQL databases?
I've got a VPS (Linode), so I can do whatever I want. It's $5/mo.
This may be true for the USA, but EU liberal arts degrees can be incredibly valuable. In fact, my friend's liberal arts bachelors degree literally lead to them doing a data science masters, while mine has resulted in me getting a top class LLM.
What you can also do is embed them videos through an iframe. Im not 100% positive but I'm 99.9_% positive that the data in your iframe won't pass through your server and it should save you money
Then it's the same as on Linux.
Maybe you're trying to run Python 3 code and your standard intepreter is 2.x? Try: python3 script.py
Make the absolute minimum and keep improving on it. A list of dicts is a great way to store multiple attributes of many individual things - eg tasks = [{'name':'take out trash', 'completed':False},{'name':'study python', 'completed':True},.......] figure out how to print all the completed tasks, all the non completed etc. The point of this is to practice the _logic_ you are trying to implement, instead of just going straight to implementation. This allows you to think more clearly about the structure of the project. Once you want to scale up to a full application I reccomend django. Thenewboston has a great series on youtube. You are off to a great start though. my first project was a little utility for reading customer orders and sending text messages. It was hard but interesting at the time and motivated me to learn. Now days I teach python to analysts and business folk regularly. 
The general terms was in a comment above but given the situation I doubt he can post the whole thing. &gt; I got given 2 raw (uncleaned) data sets and was asked to clean them, produce some basic statistics and figures, then to write a page report on interesting findings as I see fit. There wasn't a lot of direction honestly. &gt; One data set was financial and the other was for survey data. (Thank god for regex because the survey data was a goddamn mess)

We hire college candidates, at associate level, for around 70k. My bit of advice, as a hiring manager... Don't expect to stay there very long. This is a stepping stone, and you will progress faster by moving every few years or so, for the next decade. If you stay at the same place, you can enjoy modest raises and 3% adjustment bumps every year (if there's no adjustment just consider that a sign). If you move early, you'll accelerate that quite a bit. There's only one catch: you have to prove you're capable of learning, and stay hungry to do so.
This. I have an Accounting degree and have been learning python but can't get interviews. 
Here's how you handle the form: create the data models in models.py, create form in forms.py with ModelForms - all you have to do is define the class and the fields you want. Pass the form as part of the context in views.py. I am assuming you know how to run migrations so won't go into detail. For the report page you can just query the db using djangos ORM and pass that to the render call as context. Use jinja template to access this in the html like so {{thing.attribute}} you can also implement loops and conditional directly in the template. If you get lost PM me. 
As someone just learning python, this is so wild. We have people at my firm with MS and PhD science and engineering degrees with 5-10 years experience in one of the most expensive cities in the US being paid less than that. I guess that’s just the market, hopefully it holds up for the tech industry.
No instead he wrote an AI to do the interviews
Yes this is progress. Just because you think you don't need it doesn't mean it is actually not needed. A ton of python 2 code is broken and crashes whenever it receives string with high ASCII numbers. Writing a correct code in Python 2 that handles Unicode correctly is quite hard even when you understand Unicode well. You need to place the mentioned u'' strings in right places, you need to know when to do conversion etc. In Python 3 you just don't have to worry about that anymore, the code just works and all is happening nearly invisible to the programmer. Ironically, what you said about using u'', those strings are from Python 2 and have no special meaning in Python 3, they are equivalent to regular '' strings. u'' strings were introduced in Python 3 to make porting from Python 2 easier, but are totally useless on their own.

Indeed the math major is a big factor. OP can you elaborate some of the key concepts of your math major that play a role in data science / machine learning ? I think it is important for starting data scientist to get a feel of the math diving into the field.
Thanks... Now i got it. I've realized that there is a username and password for it. Misguided by some other person.
Nice liking system for the blog, how did you do it i'm interested. (I'm trying to do something similar)
when you do python --version what is the output
It seems that this is a kernel-only competition on Kaggle. What this means is that there isn't anything wrong with your local setup, but the notebook published there is not meant to be replicated locally in this way. If you want to play with it, you have to do it via a Kaggle Kernel, which is like a Jupyter notebook but hosted by Kaggle. I assume within this environment they have some additional packages which allow using kaggle.competitions. Try going to https://www.kaggle.com/kernels then create new kernel at the top of the page try replicating the kernel you posted. It should work fine.
Anyone have any advise on where to find practice problems that are closely related to problems that may be asked in an interview such as this one?

I followed these and made some projects, i will list a few: \- Discord bot (Python OR javascript) \- Flask Application \- A program that parses a webpage and gets the most common word and plots it on a graph \- A program that crawls webpages for email addressed If those are too complicated here are a few I did right at the beginning: \- A vending machine (you have money and buy stuff and it dedeucts money) \- A dice game, whoever rolls the highest wins \- A program that produces random math problems to solve \- A program that takes a sentence and tells you how many lower case, upper case, digits, whitespace and symbols are in it. As for coding in general, once you know the basic programming constructs learning other languages becomes alot easier.
No. Should I use it?
Depends on what you are trying to do. You can't typically display an imagine in the CLI, so if you are creating an interface it's a good idea to use a framework. 
If I were to make a picture in let’s say photoshop, and I wanted to import it to python so it could move around with a script. How would I do that

How many hours a day did you practice python?
Have you taken a look at `pipenv`? It can help you to avoid thinking about your virtual environments since it takes care of many things automatically.
People don't realize that your coding ability isn't everything. I would take a semi-average python dev with great personal skills and a proven willingness to learn over an expert python dev who looks like they are gonna fight you on everything or is just creepy.
What did your friend get a bachelors in? Our definitions of a liberal arts degree might be different. For the USA, its things like English, Art, Music Performance, Languages, etc.

Good job! Very nice mate.
It's definitely possible to land a job without a degree. Where the degree helps is when you want to change to a new job (or are forced to by circumstances) and then you have to prove yourself from the beginning again at a new place, probably starting over with technician pay.
This is a great idea bro. How about building this in the IDE you are using? For example the editor Atom provides the opportunity to add features like this. You do have to build them but it is possible. I will put this on my to do list for when I have time. I like your way of thinking.
Wow well done!
You have the brains to learn math? It is never too late.
Happy Diwali! (in advance)
It's definitely possible if your dad is the CEO. Well, or that sort of thing, yes. Nowadays that's much harder to do than before, the degree does matter. Yes, some engineering positions or industries don't necessarily require an engineering degree like in quality or applications or even sales &amp; etc., and can be mostly learned through OJT or relevant experiences (think automation stuff). But EE? Even embedded systems software engineering? Very hard, and even then it's hard to be sure that the basics are there. I would believe Zouden more if he transferred into the position internally, rather than got it externally. 
Oh wonderful. VSCode is aware of these local venvs by default. So it just works. This solves so many of my pains. 
Thank you so much! I really appreciate your input, because it sounds like you really know what you're talking about if you're an educator. I would love to continue talking with you about stuff if you can find the time to spare. I was actually told by a very good friend of mine who's a software engineer that the more important part of programming is to figure out *how* to do things, not just doing them. And she's not the only one I've heard that from. I watched a lecture last week that said something similar. So, I adjusted my strategy and whenever I get an idea for a program while I'm at work or whatever, I'll jot down the function of the program, how I'm going to achieve it, what the goals and boundaries of the program are, steps to the goal (so like if I want to make the program print three specific words, I would jot down the outline for doing that, NOT the code itself), and then further elaborate from there. For example, one of my program ideas, most likely by far the most ambitious, is to somehow create a program that can take an ebook, epub, or really any text document and read it to the user out loud. I got this idea while thinking about Google Duplex, which if you don't know, is basically a very organic sounding AI that will be able to perform tasks for the user such as making phone calls for appointments, and it will sound like a person even though its not. Basically, the overarching idea is to throw an AI API at my program, then pipe text through its ability to organically read to the user and sound somewhat human while doing it. Like, yeah, this could probably be somewhat easily achieved if I wanted any old computer translator voice to read something to me, but it would sound like hell because those voice AIs don't do anything like inflections, nor do they know how to structure a sentence while speaking to make it actually SOUND like a sentence. Anyway, my point is that I got the idea for this program. Instead of pulling out evernote and starting to type up code (which would be absurd anyway because I don't even know where to START with this, and I likely won't for quite some time), I began typing up the goal, parts, boundaries, functions, and needs of the program, and how I might implement things to solve each equation/section of the program. I don't know if that makes a whole ton of sense but I'm hoping you get the jist. So, yeah, I'm plugging away. I'm fleshing out my ideas and when I have time, I'm studying the overarching parts of programming. I try to spend time every single day learning or doing SOMETHING programm-y so I can build a habit in my brain, which will make it easier for me to do this in the long term (it's often said that it takes about a month to make something a habit if you do it every day during that month). I actually didn't succeed last night because, well, I got drunk with a friend, but two nights ago I learned about while loops and used the concept to modify and improve one of my programs. If you have any other advice, tips, or resources for me I'd be absolutely over the moon dude. Again, I'd love to have a longer conversation with you about this because it sounds like you're really well-versed. I've added TheNewBoston to my study list for when I move on to Django, which is a part of my plan. 
He's 21 and nobody would expect this to be his last job either, but it sure is better than being jobless and having nothing to write in his resume.
I forgot who it was that said it, but they were being interviewed and they said something along the lines of “if I’m the smartest or most skilled person in the room, then I’m in the wrong room”
Thanks 
How about generating a wallpaper with the randomness based on location, weather and time. The wallpaper should represent those inputs of weather, location and time with colors and shapes. I've always wanted something like this.
That's a cool idea. I'll see if I can do something with this. Thanks 
None of those, but I have a PhD (in genetics) and built a microscope which I think impressed them enough to get the job.
Hey dude, I know what it feels like. The thing is, there is no magic bullet. Study habits are something you have to build up on your own. Learning how to learn in a way that works for you, isn't something you pick up just because you take a college course. If you don't figure that out for yourself, you'll just end up dropping out. The key is to keep trying. Start learning Python now. Try different books, different websites, keep trying even if you gave up for a week, a month, etc... You'll see that every time you come back, things get a little easier. Don't move past the basics until you really get what they are doing. If you get stuck on something, watch/read as many different explanations of that topic as you can, keep coming back to it. Remember that it's okay not to get something, the frustration that comes with it is normal. Once you realize that all it takes is to keep trying, things will snowball and learning will begin to be something you enjoy. If you want to start doing this with math: https://www.khanacademy.org Start with the basics and really understand core concepts of algebra otherwise you will spend a lot of time back tracking later and hitting walls. Don't ever let yourself skip things because of the classic "when will I ever use this?" line. The best thing you can do is hold yourself accountable for your own success. At the end of the day you have to rely on yourself and how you overcome difficult situations. Building up that skill may prove more valuable than any degree.
One's stuck where they are and probably going to leave the company/cause someone else to leave, the other will encourage the team and bring them together as they train up the willing-to-learn new guy.

Reinstalling won't help, if it was compiled without SQLite bindings. Simply recompiling won't help either: you need to have SQLite headers somewhere on your include path for Python to find them and compile with them.
I agree with this partially, but also want to clarify that you can still get a Math or Computer Science degree at a liberal arts college (which is what I did, and absolutely loved the opportunity) and that could be seen as a “liberal arts degree” in a technical sense. 
&gt;Lack of implicit return. &amp;#x200B; Just wrap everything in a lambda /s
Nah. I have a 'liberal arts degree'. It's never mattered for me, or anyone I know. What *did* matter was skills and experience. Always. And those are *always* given preference. Also, I've done hiring. I don't prefer math majors at all. In fact, people with a degree in math are often not well-rounded enough to do analysis. *Anybody* can learn the math. Do some places prefer 'math majors'? Sure, because companies differ. I've seen one that preferred Economics. One that preferred an urban planning education. Several that prefer GIS training. Don't play this 'optimize my degree for a job' path, unless you're dead set on a very well-defined path (e.g., electrical engineering, etc.). This urban legend of having a math degree being the key to success is demonstrably false. 
Looking forward to get amazed.
i don't use vscode but i suspect there is a setting or at least a plugin that will handle that 
That is definitely not what someone means when they say liberal arts degree. 
Pretty much any GUI module will do that. [Here's a short list](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/faq#wiki_what_gui_should_i_use.3F). --- If you have more questions like this it's better to post them on /r/learnpython. Be sure to [format your code for reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/faq#wiki_how_do_i_format_code.3F) or use a site like pastebin. Also, include which version of python and what OS you are using. 
That depends on what exactly you mean by "apps". Do you want to rebuilt the UI entirely, or do you just want a browser window without the browser controls?

I'd just like to say, I think Exercism is a great resource. I've signed up to do some mentoring. For anyone who enjoys obsessively tweaking code, it's a nice way to spend a Sunday morning!
Very nice!!!
Oh, also, even before PEP-484, good IDEs did a pretty decent job without type hints by inference.
Is this where we are? 50% raises every 2 years? Sounds pretty unsustainable to me. 
At least to start, I would like the second option. I don't think the websites have any sort of an API, so I don't know if I would be able to do the first option. Eventually I might try my hand at building the entire UI, but not to begin with.

Awesome, congratulations! I would have been very happy getting such a well-paid job at 21. Keep pushing! ;)
Both resources are a bit unstructured (although definitely comprehensive ;)). Might not work for everybody...
That works great, thanks! Still, if I want to do it using python without chromium dependency, what would you suggest?
You'll have to run into a web engine dependency at some point anyway. You can use QtWebKit or WebKitGtk or whatever, but you're still basically pulling in a browser engine and a GUI framework.
No that’s just what’s normal for a data scientist if not more. Op should get some experience and then leave for more money. Why do you think they hired him so quickly? 67k is cheap for the skill set they are getting
Got it, thanks.
Yes it is. It’s all volunteer based. The more mentors we get, the less students have to wait in a queue to have their submitted exercises mentored.
Fuck ya. $67K at the start of a career and only 21! Dude, imagine the earning potential mid career😳
Oh god. I'm living that scene in The Big Short where Steve Carell's character realizes there's a bubble.
I've just heard it construed as an instruction to avoid liberal arts schools before, wasn't challenging the common meaning of the phrase.
I have a liberal arts degree. Can confirm.
Can you give me some examples 
That's fairly broad because there's literally infinite applications of programming but I'll give it a go. AI is huge right now and largely revolves around mathematics and linear algebra. This is something you probably wouldn't run into if you're creating a site for a mom and pop shop

Liberal arts major here who works at a F100 as a data engineer and, at least IMO, better at developing data solutions than plenty of CS grads) Don't give up and don't act like your degree is a weakness, it's not. You're interviews should end with the interviewers being impressed by the various kinds of soft skills having a liberal arts degree gave you. But also because it's clear you know your shit on the technical side.
I’m not great at math I only finished high school math , North America. So I worry I’m wasting time trying to learn code
What do you mean you're not good at math? Do you mean you really try hard and just don't understand, or do you mean you didn't like class and got bad grades? Math and programming are similar in that they both follow a logical order of operations. But there is all kinds of programming you can do without involving heavy math applications. If you mean you're not good at algebra, x + y = z, then maybe programming will actually help you get much better at math by giving you practical examples of how algebra is used.
It’s been a while since I was in school, so , I remember it being difficult to grasp but I was also an idiot in school and didn’t pay attention to lessons
Get in touch with Harrington Starr. They do recruitment for financial services and hedge funds.

Congratulations! 
I recommend looking up the discussions around `pipenv`, `poetry`, `pyproject.toml`, and the rest of the clusterfuck which is python packaging. Pipenv claims to do a lot more than it actually does and doesn't solve some of the biggest problems in packaging. If you just want something to manage virtual environments, there are much simpler solutions which don't actually impact your code and force a particular toolchain on your end users. For example, I use `pyenv` (which happens to be an optional dependency of pipenv, too) to install python versions and manage my virtual environments. For example, if I don't have python 3.7.1 anywhere on my computer, I can just: pyenv install 3.7.1 pyenv virtualenv 3.7.1 myenvironment pyenv local myenvironment Now every time I `cd` into that directory (or a subdirectory), it'll automatically activate that environment, then deactivate when I leave. It makes your workflow independent of the system python, and works for pypy and a bunch of other python distributions (like conda, with a bit of fiddling) too! It's unix-only, if that makes any difference to you. To get even more basic, you could use `direnv`, which allows you to put a `.envrc` file in any directory to change some environment variables (e.g. changing your PATH to point to a virtualenv directory). When you enter that directory or a subdirectory, your previous environment state is saved, the changes are applied, then when you leave, your old state is restored. Neither of these things impact your downstream users' experiences (where pipenv forces them to adopt a new installation regime), which makes them much better development tools.

I'm not involved with Exercism except as a user, but the site is open source and free, and has been for years. I've never seen any ads, and you can check out their github to see all the source. My impression is that it's largely volunteer based. Looking around a little, there's a tiny link on the page to the backing company (Thalmus) - I assume they cover the hosting costs, and contribute some engineer time to the project, but you wouldn't even notice that link if you weren't looking for it. I'm assuming the main purpose is basically community outreach.
I have been learning/ writing scripts and a small personal project for over a year now and the most math I have used is in a counter where I add 1 to the counter after doing something. For what I have done I wouldn't say I was good at it but I can rename files and scrap the web and use API pretty well along with full SQL and sqlite3 databases. So it is up to u if you want to learn it. How determined are you. You will be your only obsticale everything else just Google.
&gt;Anybody can learn the math Now that's just straight up not true, cmon. If I was able to pick up stochastic calculus I'd be working in a quant firm already. &gt;I don't prefer math majors at all. In fact, people with a degree in math are often not well-rounded enough to do analysis. You can't just use your personal experience and speak for the entire population as a whole. &gt;This urban legend of having a math degree being the key to success is demonstrably false. As far as STEM goes, math/physics majors are able to transition fairly easily into almost all fields in STEM. CS is just an applied version of mathematical logic, and engineering is just specialized applications of applied physics. It is not an urban legend, there's definitely a reason people say this. I'm have an engineering degree, so its not like I'm protecting people of my own degree or something either.
At some point, there is a boundary (that you can cross) between Python and external libraries (including the operating system). Although the application itself is written in Python, there are lower level mechanisms available that allow you to bind to libraries written in other languages (C, C++).

I love posts like these! What kind of coding interview did they put you through?
If you got a job like that straight out of school (almost) it probably has more to do with your skills/hard work. Python is awesome, but don't go crediting a programming language for your time and effort.

No problem, feel free to reach out to me if you have any specific questions. I work with AI researchers often mostly consulting on project structure and code quality. I would say though if you are just starting learn fundamentals, oop, and a ton of other stuff before going down the AI path. remember that AI, machine learning etc is much much much more about the 'do you understand the math' then 'can you program' - i.e. a math PhD is closer to AI programming than an advanced programmer is.... not to discourage you or anything but just think about where you want to spend your efforts. 
Try Plotly I use it with R because it takes advantage of DPLYR syntax and is quite customizable, it should be damn fine in Python too.
Yeah math degrees are weird. On one hand, I don't have "out the box" skills and training, on the other hand people seem to appreciate the degree and it's flexibility. I guess I should mention I have a B+/A- average if that means anything to anyone.
being the smartest in the room is not necessarily bad it allows slacking and being relaxed but it is less motivating when it comes to learning new things, so being relaxed may degenerate into getting lazy it's like having one eye and feeling cool among the blind, but at some point you realize others have two eyes
I found this interesting for new Python learners - but never mind. Thanks for your comment!
That's crazy. Mind if I ask which city? 
Pycharm is not really the same sort of thing as Anaconda or IDLE. PyCharm is an IDE, Anaconda is a python distribution-ish sort of thing, and IDLE is just a REPL. It's like asking what the "disbenefits" of carpooling to work instead of having comfortable and good-looking work clothes. You don't have to choose one over the other.
&gt;Prove it's not true. What? Since when is the burden of proof on me to disprove a claim? Shouldn't you be proving that it IS true? What the fuck? Do you see scientists go around and say "This is my hypothesis, I'm not offering any evidence, you have to disprove my claim otherwise it's true"? All you offered was a single statement and absolutely nothing to back it up. &gt;Also, prove you know what areas of math someone must know. At no point in your original post did you talk about this, nor did I. But if you're doing quantitative finance you pretty much have to know about game theory, probability theory, stochastic calculus. And finance is a traditionally "liberal arts" minded field, since you don't get a BS in it. &gt;And then you literally contradict yourself by making a claim about perhaps tens of thousands of people. Because there are tens of thousands of people that this claim does fit. For fuck's sake, mathemeticians ***INVENTED*** computer science. Engineering is LITERALLY applied physics using certain equations. If you don't like the truth, then talk about it. But if you want to share your own experience, you should probably not preface it with "in fact", because the word fact implies, well, a fact. Which your opinion unfortunately is not.
Same here. Did IT for 5 years. Learned a lot but there is def a ceiling there. Finally got a job as a devops engineer and got a 50% raise salary and in 2 years it will probably double.

No, I was aware. I just thought it was a bad joke.
You keep asking me to disprove your claim after you make a claim and provide absolutely nothing to support it. I've never really seen someone try to pass this off as the typical way of doing things. Not sure where you work, but that doesn't sound like the type of environment that fosters any productive brainstorming. &gt;It’s clear you have a bias. It's funny, I don't have a vested interest on either side seeing as I'm neither a liberal arts degree holder nor a physics/math major, but you do. Yet I'm the one with a bias? Are you perhaps unable to see the fact that you're extremely biased? Have a good day, maybe one day you'll come to and see how your prejudices are blinding you. Seems to me that you have a grudge against people with these degrees for whatever reason.
You can't blanket statement it. My degree is comp sci/software dev but it's marked as liberal arts with my school. And I've got employment guaranteed upon graduating in 6 weeks as well in m field.
Im a beginner so whats the difference bw an REPL and an IDE. 
Testing-out an little experiment deployment and machine learning model optimization tool I made last week. It's pretty simple but gets the job done. Was tired of writing these scripts with all the experiment logic along with the machine learning models tied together so I made this: [https://github.com/davidenunes/exp](https://github.com/davidenunes/exp) so far so good, in the last 6 hours it found two model configurations better than the ones that took me two weeks to get right. work my little slave, work. **whip crack** x'D
Ok, thank you!

Pycharm is an IDE and you can set your interpreter to be any python you need. If you are working on some small scripts you can manage with a text editor and a few plugins (atom, sublime, vs code) and then again run it with any python. Pycharm is great for larger projects, and the community version is free

Maybe don’t use spider, use pycharm, atom, sublime or vVSCode.
User name definitely checks out. Your comment history is literally you raging and cursing at dozens of people. Are you okay, man? You realize this is just a post about a guy getting a job, right? 
I'm trying to understand the technical reason behind this. 
Data scientist here. The single most important class is linear algebra for machine learning. 
You could have unintentionally overwritten the script by running it, or spyder having some other issue.
Do you intend to stay in the mining industry?
IDE is like a super fancy version of Notepad that can help you code by giving you suggestions and all sorts of neat stuff. A REPL is a thing where you type one line of code in and it spits out the result. You don't use it to write full programs, you use it to try out things real quick like. 
Exercism doesn't generate revenue and never really has (maybe the odd $50 here and there in gifts). We spend between $2,500/month and $5,000/month on servers, emails, general costs, paying people to work full-time on mini-projects etc. That money comes from the co-founders who donate if from their day-jobs as developers. We \*are\* intending to generate revenue from grants (we're hoping to get our first shortly - watch this space!), and we are exploring ideas around the teams part of the site being on a paid-for basis when used by for-profit companies, and other related ideas, but no final decision has been made. We will use any revenue we do generate to pay for full-time staff (probably initially a community manager and a full-time developer) and people who are existing community-volunteers but working on the specific projects the grants are for (e.g. the first grant we think we will get is for redesigning a specific track, which will involve a degree of full-time work). Exercism Inc was setup to legally separate the founder from Exercism, just for her protection. We are intending to set Exercism up as a formal non-for-profit and are currently exploring the best ways to do this. Our aim is to have a team of 3+ people working on Exercism by the end of 2019. We do hope to take some money back out to reimburse both the actual money we have spent on Exercism (\~$150k so far) and also to reimburse the original founder for the time she's put in over the last few years (she basically worked 40hrs a week on Exercism in evenings/weekends for 4yrs). However, we're not trying to get rich off Exercism - it's not our aim or motivation. We're planning to be very explicitly transparent about everything to do with finances and this sort of thing (I'm inspired by Buffer's approach), but we're still working it all out ourselves first. For extra explicit clarity, [Exercism.io](https://Exercism.io) is and always will be free, and we won't sell your data!

A couple of tips: 1) Do not commit your build artifacts 8your dist folder) to git. 2) For &lt;80 lines of code you do not need a package. A single-file module should be enough. 3) You do not need to define `__getattr__` if you then read from `self.__dict__`. That's what the default implementation of `__getattr__` does already.
Please understand that regex is one of those pieces of code that when you regex to solve one problem if you get two more problems
Ran across the below video the other day related to this. Talks about how they came up with a method of creating more random levels while using less memory (among other things). Not Python, but really interesting conceptually. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWQ0591PAxM
1) /r/learnpython 2) XY problem? What are you actually trying to do? \`results1\` looks like you are trying to parse a date YYYY-MM-DD? If so, why not use \`datetime.strptime\`? \`results2\` looks like you are trying to parse JSON with regular expressions?
I'm assuming you'd give the same advice to someone with a Finance degree who is just starting out with Python?
Like many pure sciences, math is a liberal arts degree at many schools including mine. Math is actually listed in the definition of "liberal arts".
Your explanation would benefit from explaining what the acronyms stand for. IDE = Integrated Development Environment REPL = Read-Eval-Print Loop BTW, IDLE isn’t just a REPL, it also functions as a very basic IDE.

Hi there, from the /r/Python mods. We have removed this post as it is not suited to the /r/Python subreddit proper, however it should be very appropriate for our sister subreddit /r/LearnPython or for the r/Python discord: https://discord.gg/3Abzge7. The reason for the removal is that /r/Python is dedicated to discussion of Python news, projects, uses and debates. It is not designed to act as Q&amp;A or FAQ board. The regular community is not a fan of "how do I..." questions, so you will not get the best responses over here. On /r/LearnPython the community and the r/Python discord are actively expecting questions and are looking to help. You can expect far more understanding, encouraging and insightful responses over there. **No matter what level of question you have, if you are looking for help with Python, you should get good answers**. Make sure to check out the rules for both places. Warm regards, and best of luck with your Pythoneering!
Hi there, this post has been removed as it is not directly related to the Python programming language. It might be more topical on /r/programming, /r/coding, or /r/technology. Cheers, /r/Python mods
Use 3 spaces, it gives the PEP 8 Nazis a stroke!
Try Digital Ocean if your data usage becomes a problem. They have a soft limit but as long as you’re not going crazy I have never seen them enforce it. 
Yes, I was trying to not complicate it too much. I'm not convinced knowing what the initialisms stands for imparts any useful information to a beginner. Same for getting into the weeds about what exactly IDLE can or cannot do. 
&gt; If anyones younger and reading this-- DONT GET A LIBERAL ARTS DEGREE I have a politics degree and work as a coder. Do whatever degree you want folks. An art history major can be a coder. My CTO loves it. I had a career before coding. I can not only communicate with computers, I can communicate with people too! Apparently it's rare in the industry. 
PhDs studied under good mentors really helps since they actually teach you how to learn by yourself. The trick here is to not get overspecialized and to keep an open mind: a good adviser will make you attend and recite subdepartment seminars that are not in your subfield to maintain that breadth and they are always reading about or talking to people not in their subfield. It's not conventional, and not very many do it, but the ones that do, end up leading some of the most versatile (and sometimes controversial) people.
Business Intelligence and Analytics is where you want to be looking. Also Audit is a good place as well: CAATS outfits are always looking for automation and full-population testing + ML is really a huge boon to that. Look at [Experis](http://www.experis.com/) (yeah, it's a division of Manpower, but it's really just Jefferson Wells renamed) for staffing.
You can use github pages as a blog and link that. I did blogspot for a while, but it was a bit [tedious](http://cowbertdev.blogspot.com/) not being able to just use markdown.
Congrats on landing the job and thanks to all for their story about making the jump into programming and the positive affect.
Isn't that what Plotly basically is? Flask + JS? These days if you need something locally, I'd probably just wire up an Electron app. But I eschew local apps since deployment is always a pain - go full SaaS/PaaS and just do full stack. (Plus I like D3's flexibility).
Why you learn it though?
I manage a data team of 9 at a large health care company, and only one of them has a math degree. Four have grad degrees: one in economics, one in computer science, one in data science, and one in health administration. The team provides services all over the map, from logistics to care delivery to business decision making. My boss—call him a regional director over data efforts—has a doctorate in economics. You see, your story helps prove my original point—it’s diverse out there, and companies vary *widely* in their preferences and approach. After 30 odd years in technology and doing data work the past 9-10, I feel comfortable saying math degrees are not the magic key to working or employability in data analysis/data science/ whatever you want to label it. I also feel comfortable saying I prefer—and hire, and recommend—people with practical skills, but most importantly analytical and decision support and storytelling skills. Those people succeed every time. 
Does economics count as liberal arts lol
I worked 2.5 years in internal audit, and am now a financial analyst. I would like to move into more of a BI / data analyst role for my next position.
What was the test and the project like?
Yeah. So at least some of the skills are transferrable. 😂 
Thanks for the pointers! 
If money is your main concern, jump ship every 12-18 months. Easy 10% raise each time.
Python isn’t designed to do that, you would have to build it. Technically we could make a bridge out of popsicle sticks but that’s not what they were built for If unity already have something like this why not just use that
Put your site on cloudflare, which will cache any static assets saving bandwidth costs but it also lets you toggle SSL in one click.
Beyond the specifics themselves, spending that much with math prepares you for heavy amounts of abstraction -- breaking problems down into a set of much simpler problems. Having that much practice abstracting and breaking large problems apart becomes very useful at the upper tiers of SE.
I know, last time I created it I had used C. I lost the project folder in my laptop awhile back, and this was before GitHub was a thing in my life. I suppose I could tinker with it. But I’m heavily occupied but I can shave time
You are still going to finish college, right? You're not going to drop out for this job?
I literally laughed out loud at that. I've been doing this longer than you've been alive, so... yeah, I'm so pained by your 20-something wisdom.
Dude you need to relax lol
Aw, looks like something hit to close to home. I'm sorry.

I have to say this has worked for me, I started at NOC at 35k per year Then i went to a startup ISP as Network Engineer at 50k per year Then jumped to a Optic Fiber company that sells gigabit to the home using GPON tech. - 60k per year. This in 3 years.
I was blindly following 4 spaces for indentation, but recently I start to thinking about tabs. 1 tab mean one level deep, editors today are smart enough to show you this the way you want. I use /r/vscode and set it to display tab as 4 spaces. I don’t know if I’ll stick with it, but I am more open now. But if I am editing code that I didn’t start from scratch I always follow what is already on the file!
Usually in your project root or in your python environment. Are you using virtualenv? https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm-edu/creating-virtual-environment.html you may also have better luck in /r/LearnPython

Given that it is so easy for me to get a key, allow anonymous calls from the home page so that I can quickly test the API. Also, list the various query parameters on the homepage. I shouldn't have to make an API call to figure out how to make an API call.

How do I know if I have a new environment or existing environment?
Just apply. Temp agencies have been really good to me and I've gone from SysAdmin -&gt; Business Analytics -&gt; Data Integration and Full Stack. To prepare yourself, do a lot of personal projects and blog about them. GitHub your solutions. Participate in StackOverflow. Then you'll be able to have some pull with tech recruiters from places like TEKsystems. Do a 1-2 year contract, get converted or jump ship.
Ok, so I assume you're doing a lot of work with Excel/Pivot tables maybe some Access? What you'll want to do is start moving that to a bigger platform. Even though Python can read and write from Excel, you might want to have it read from Excel, write to something like PostgreSQL, do some SQL and then write it back to Excel. It's much less painful than doing 50 nested IFs in Excel or a VB macro. You can also look into things like Jupyter and matplotlib for graphing, and move up to Plotly. Or just hook up your Python to a lightweight web framework where it serves data to Qlikview or Tableau even. The possibilities are really endless.
What is NOC? What kind of prerequisites are needed?
How did you even find the job to apply too? As I said above usually IT/programming jobs I see have say you need a related degree and usually tons of experience which often times seem a little unrealistic. I have a degree too but its not IT/pogramming relate even though I have taken programming classes before and do I have some knowledge of python. I am curious if you have any tips on where to look or do you know of anyplace hiring in the usa that you think I may have a shot at even if its entry level like 35.000 year to start. 
Network Operations Center, here are the tier 1, tier 2! Is a entry position which you can learn and get promotions if you do the right things. Here you will need basic knowledge of networking, also maybe good understanding of routing protocols and other trchnologies. Obviously this is an ISP point of view, on enterprise I suppose a help desk and then you need to study and practice, learn how to troubleshooting and show that you are really learning and your involvement in the company, hopefully this get you to another position and you will have something importan which is work experience. Any other doubts you can contact me

This is a cut and paste from above but because of your background I thought I would ask you as well. 
In my most recent experience (I work in aerospace), math/(applied) physics/engineers make the worst business people (and honestly some of them would make bad scientists too). Many are hyper-detail driven, which is a good thing when we're talking about metrology but where they forget that the enemy of good is perfection, instead of doing the outer analysis of what amount of error can be tolerated and working to that metric instead. This causes incredible amounts of inertia in the business world when unnecessary delays cost money. Even accountants know that at times balancing to the penny is often a lost cause (and that's why variance-type transactions, accruals and minor writeoffs are made against the ledger at the end of the period). Another trait I've noticed is the "head in the weeds" thinking where they are really good at the one calculation or whatever but never bother to ask "why are we doing this" (a trait shared most commonly with junior science grad students) or make any sort of valuation analysis - often known as "bothering to learn the bigger picture".

Are you or your company hiring? Somone with a 4 year degree and some python knowlege (I really like the language). 
According the World Economic Forum Future of Jobs Report from 2016, the [top 10 skills forecast to be preferred in 2020](https://weforum-assets-production.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/editor/bD4ikTLC2_fTr1843WCwYsZFbkCs-VwJBAQu2COD1rE.png) are: :-:|:-- 1|Complex Problem Solving 2|Critical Thinking 3|Creativity 4|People Management 5|Coordinating with Others 6|Emotional Intelligence 7|Judgement and Decision Making 8|Service Orientation 9|Negotiation 10|Cognitive Flexibility These are _all_ aligned with what a liberal arts education is supposed to equip you with.
When you say associate level I am assuming you are talking about asscoiate degree's? I have a 4 year degree in a non IT/programming field but I have taken classes in programming and have done some python programming as a hobby. I have worked different types of jobs so one of my traits is that I am pretty versatile in what I can do. Do you know of anyone hiring for anything really that pays decent enough right now IT related or not? When I say decent it can depend on cost of living but even entry level pay I might be interested in. 
And enable http2 while you're at it. `listen 443 ssl http2` A nice acme client if you still don't have a favorite: https://github.com/Neilpang/acme.sh
Couldn't recommend "automate the boring stuff more." It's a great resource. 
You know of any NOC's that are hiring at the moment or any recommendations of any websites that post those type of jobs?
I have two disagree here, a liberal arts degree can be quite useful. A lot of data science success relies on communication and soft skills. Candidates with these as well as the technical skills stand out. Undergraduate stem degree is not necessary to understand programming logic, mathematics, and ML, just a nice head start. 
&gt;codecademy then automate the boring stuff Wtf, is it that easy to get a programming job? I've been programming with Python for a few years and I've written some useful software for my job and for personal use but the programming interview process intimidates me so I keep putting it off.
https://scrapy.org/ 
Oh nice, I finished that months ago, and still turn to it every now and again for reference. I would say a lot of my base came from that book. Anything you'd recommend after that?
I'm not sure what you're wanting to achieve with this post. You have a crawler and want people to suggest what to crawl for? You're wanting to build one but are unsure how to start? ... Either case, your timing seems optimistic. A couple weeks ago I built a thing to crawl a site much, much smaller than Amazon and it took significantly longer than 2 to 3 minutes to go through the whole thing. Just FYI.
Going through the documentation and practicing it. At a certain point you just gotta explore on your own. 
I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit: - [/r/flask] [How to send non blocking emails from Flask web server ?](https://www.reddit.com/r/flask/comments/9u1a16/how_to_send_non_blocking_emails_from_flask_web/) &amp;nbsp;*^(If you follow any of the above links, please respect the rules of reddit and don't vote in the other threads.) ^\([Info](/r/TotesMessenger) ^/ ^[Contact](/message/compose?to=/r/TotesMessenger))*
The interview was pretty light on technical questions honestly. A few stats questions, a few questions on super basic python. I think mostly so they know if they should bother giving you the test. Also I did a lot of practice in my own way and time. Just go for it. 
Use a massage queue like RabbitMQ. All mail communications should be picked up by another process. Even if you have disturbance in your matrix, queues are always kept until they are processed. Also you can load balance the shit out of this and scale based on demand. Yeah it's a lot of work. But more robust and scalable.
Actually, for creating UI windows you don't necessarily need a native extensions, at least not on Linux. The way things are drawn on Linux display has multiple tiers, but the interesting one for us is the X-server. This one is responsible for creating windows. X-server communicates with clients using TCP, normally, it listens on port 6000. So, you can look up its protocol specification, and implement it in Python client. Python standard library has everything you need for this: sockets and parsing sequences of bytes.
Thanks! I'll take a look.
Stumbled upon RabbitMQ when I was researching on message handling. Looks like it could get the job done. But I'll use it if I feel my customer base is increasing..right now, I believe I can do away with not using a dedicated service like RabbitMQ for handling my emails given that the traffic is quite low. Also I do not have much time on hand to learn a new tech and implement it without errors before the Deployment deadline. So I'm going to stick with thread/async solution for now. Which one do you think will be better in terms or efficiency and memory usage between the two ?
Ok good luck on your journeys. I can't benchmark and give you an exact answer on efficiency and memory usage as there are many unknown factors for me. But you have to start somewhere. So as you already have a path you're on, just continue. But keep in mind that breaking up big flows in multiple smaller flows are best practice and more efficient in the long run.
Facts Scrapy is underrated for webscraping However its a bummer that you’ll need a subscription to scrape as much as you want w/out getting your IP blocked

well pycharm will ball if it can’t find a python binary. but it may look for the default system python out of the box. you wanna find a good spot locally for your project environment - something like /home/Shadow653/dev/.virtual_environments or something. some people like them in the same root directory of the project, but it can be a hassle with git or dropbox - you don’t wanna sync your entire python environment. it’s too large and too easy to rebuild. the benefit of using virtualenv and pip (or venv) is you can mess around with it, and if something goes bad you can blow it away and start over without harming your system python environment. Just find a good spot, setup your env with virtualenv, use pip to update everything and in pycharm go into Settings and you can select with environment to use. when you go to your project root, you use the ‘source’ command to locate the python binary you wanna use and it’ll drop you into that environment. * https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/userguide/ * https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/configuring-python-interpreter.html the basic answer is you can do a ‘which python’ from the terminal to see your system python part. once your virtualenv is activated, the same command should show you /home/Shadow653/dev/.virtual_environments/my_project_env/bin/python3.7/python or whatever you’ve setup.
I recently created a package called [messages](https://github.com/trp07/messages). It wraps standard library and API calls to create as consistent an API to send various message types, such as emails, text messages, etc. I'm looking to expand it to many more messages types and am always looking for new contributors. I think the package would be perfect for automated programs that would send a message for certain results.

How will you get IP blocked specifically with Scrapy and not other scraping methods?
What about pushing my data into an array on the Python side? So that the chart will load data from the array 
If you're struggling with dynamic content, another library to give a look at is requests_html. It's the requests library with JavaScript support!
Why would I want to scrap a website? Can someone give me some good examples?
Working on translating the documentation also helps :) Para los que hablen español e ingles, y saben programar :P Cual documentación se les hace difícil?
Yes, you can. Just do it! &amp;#x200B; Seriously, though, the following official tutorial will give you a detailed walkthrough. Having SQL experience will also help.
What other programming experience do you have?
Not a good one. Use flask it’s easier 
It still doesn't belong in /r/Python. 
I believe flask would be easier to learn quickly. For simple single/few page projects, bottle would be even easier to use.

I do know some python. But I gave up on django as found it hard to get anywhere fast. Maybe it was because I also was trying to get my head around the whole MVC thing at the same time. Its python but really it’s a lot of config

So I did a 16 week conversion course and got a job at week 15. It was awful, the first job. I was sole back end dev for a startup. I left after 3 months into the job I'm in now which I love. For the first one they reached out to me, for the second one, I messaged the CTO on LinkedIn because I saw they worked with Vuejs which i enjoyed working with. He later told me he didn't think he'd hire me and just wanted to meet me because of my previous career, but I guess I did enough to convince him in the interview. 
Simple solution is to install an email server (postfix, exim etc.) on the same machine as the webapp that uses your real email server as a smarthost. The local server will accept the mail in a fraction of a second and take care of all the queuing and resending itself.
I second this. Requests HTML is the the most simple and easy to use web scraping library for python.
Yes actually, I did it for a job interview once, they were okay with it. That was two years ago, I assume the documentation and guides have only gotten better.
Flask might be better suited to your requirements
Unlikely unless you are quite experienced in another similar framework like Ruby on Rails.
You want to build a database of movies and all their details, so you scrape IMDb 
You can setup a Flask web app in just a few lines of code. Django requires a little bit more time to get used to and to get it running. But I heard that Django is easier for scaling, which I haven't really found out myself. My guess would be that Flask is the better option unless you intend your website to be massive.
I've updated the website to support upto 10 colors
&gt; But is it possible to use asyncio to achieve the same ? In theory, sure. You just need an asyncio-compatible SMTP library. It's also absolutely fine to do in a thread. You're taking this asyncio business a bit too much to heart. It only really comes into its own when you have dozens or hundreds of *simultaneous* connections and your app isn't doing much but shovelling data to the clients from somewhere else. Regular Flask apps can *easily* handle hundreds of connections per minute. And will likely perform better if your app is doing any meaningful data processing. 
To set up a Django app you have to learn its special ritual which can be a pain in the ass for a complete beginner. The official docs are not especially helpful for absolute beginners to be honest. For a non Python programmer [https://tutorial.djangogirls.org](https://tutorial.djangogirls.org) is probably the best choice.
If you want to stick with a threading solution initially, check out Miguel Grinberg's email entry in the Flask mega tutorial. There's an async section near the bottom. https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-x-email-support

Oh, I actually followed that tutorial. He uses threads for asynchronous behaviour. I wanted to know if I can do the same using asyncio.
It's a way of learning just like any other. The good/bad thing about Django is that it does a lot of stuff for you. The user system and admin gives you a lot of functionality for free... if your website needs either, it will make you very productive. Which kind of website do you want to build? I came in expecting people to say Django is complex and recommending Flask, and I was not disappointed. Flask is much more minimalistic. Is it easier to learn than Django? Depends at how you look at it. Is there a lot more to learn about Django? Surely. Will you need to learn less stuff do some some things? Yes. If you want foundational learning, a minimalistic framework might be a great idea. If you want productivity, Django is probably better (if your project involves the "batteries included" bits of Django). Another thing is if you want a JS-heavy SPA. That changes things a lot. In the end, I still don't know what to recommend. What kind of website do you want to create?
Use threading.Thread() instead of asyncio for something like this. Python makes it fairly easy even for a beginner to get started.
I use Django at work every single day. But as others have suggested, I think Flask might be easier just to get something up and running.
Yeah I've tried to get into django a few times and gotten lost quickly each time. Last week I spent half a day trying flask and built a reasonably functional kanban board app. Never used jinja or sqlite so had to pick those up too
hint hint datetime.now() - timedelta(minutes=1) datetime.datetime(2018, 11, 4, 1, 40, 12, 668469) datetime.now() datetime.datetime(2018, 11, 4, 1, 41, 19, 246850, fold=1) &amp;#x200B;
Thank you. I have followed his tutorial and my question is inspired from it. I know I can achieve the same using threading but consider a scenario where I have 100+ customers at the same time. Then to accommodate them, I'll need 100 threads , which can be a strain on the memory. I was reading up on coroutines based asynchronous programming which consumes much lesser memory than a thread does. I wanted to know is it possible to do the same using asyncio ?
No. It's too complex by far. You need to have a solid grasp of OOP concepts in Python to wrap your head around the MVC paradigm. A few weeks would do it, hours... Nope. 
So basically, before the email is sent and after the user clicks a button which triggers the sending of the email , the following actions take place - 1. Copy the user entered data into a excel file. 2. Append user account related data into the excel file. 3. Generate a pdf out of the excel. 4. Attach both the pdf and excel to the mail and send it. Right now the excel file's contents are not much. But it's bound to grow big in the near future. Is asyncio better solution for it then ? If yes, how exactly do I do it ? Shall I just append **await** keyword to the **mail.send** method call and make the entire data copying+mail sending function as async ?
Literally a bachelors in 'Liberal Arts and Sciences'. Its a programme in Europe which gives essentially gives you a variety of courses related to the Humanities, before you can focus upon a more specialized topic. My friend focused on social science in order to move to data science while I focused on law to do a law masters. I hear a lot of Americans talking shit about the American Liberal Arts degrees, but here they can be super valuable.
No.

I wrote a small tool to parse statuses from popular cloud services (has CLI and python API): [statuscheck](https://github.com/amureki/statuscheck/) I am also asking for a small feedback, like what services people would like to see in such a tool. I'd love to hear your comments/feedback here, or in [GitHub issues.](https://github.com/amureki/statuscheck/issues/1)
Yes. I haven't used django for a while now, but as someone who had already done web development with php (Symfony and Zend) when I started with django, I had no trouble at all switching to Django. It's a really well thought out framework and the tutorial is great.
How does Django bring better scalability? 
Where have you deployed this? 
Scalability is perhaps not the right word. It's more that as your app grows bigger, you'll need to use more and more of the features that comes out-of-box with Django but not with Flask. A small application might not need all the stuff that Django comes with, but if you're expecting the application to get bigger you'll be happier off if you started with Django instead of Flask.
OK I got it and now. Thanks. Out of curiosity, do you know activerecords or ecto? 
Can you explain to me what discrete mathematics is? I've done two uni courses on it and even did rather well, but I still don't really know what it is. 
First of all, this isn't a python-specific question. Or at least I'm not answering it that way. Second, there isn't a well-defined difference for the two. I tend to use "program" for a single scripts or backend pieces and "application" for a more full-fledged, user-facing thing. 
One of the things I love about Django is that it comes with tons of stuff out of the box. The community has written apps for pretty much everything that you can plug in and start using. Whereas in Flask you are expected to write some of that stuff yourself with a more DIY approach. &amp;#x200B; For instance, if I want to add credit card payments for my users and I have no user interface or Stripe code at all, I can just add an app to get a user interface and one for a Stripe backend. Then it allows me to focus on writing real time notifications or a rare feature that has not been built by somebody else.
It also realllllllllly depends on his vba or general programming skills I would say 
They're synonyms.
Theoretically, program is a standalone unit (i.e command script) and application is a part of the the larger system (i.e WSGI script). Practically, these two terms are used interchangeably. Language does not matter.

Excel is not my database. I have to generate a report, which needs to be in Excel format. The excel file will be filled with contents fetched from database (My SQL) and some user entered form data.
Build the core first. You can use Tensorflow for image recognition and tagging. If you can do that then building the app with upload is fairly simple with django ImageField and ModelForm. 
Give a shot to [KiWi](https://kivy.org/#home) It's really intuitive to use.

Highly recommend Django for girls tutorial, used it to build my app. Few hours is a bit ambitious, it took me about 2 weeks (but my app was quite complex and had a number of integrations with 3rd parties)
I haven’t used Django’s ORM yet, is it similar to Hibernate?
Hi swift, can you advise what are advantages (or disanvantages) of Django over PHP (mvc) for web development ? Does learning of django/python web dev. justifies switching from php? I did however setup django, but I used pythonanywhere hosting free option - it is very easy with this site as Diango was already preconfigured. 
Both. Ultimately, you must understand the basic concepts to decide how best to tackle a problem. However, you also need to be able to articulate what you are doing and why. I always suggest focusing on understanding. I come across people all the time that try to explain without understanding, and it is screamingly obvious. I've never seen anybody who understands something but can't explain it. Keep in mind that there is a big difference between learning a language and learning programming. A simple example is sorting an array. In Python, you can just use `sorted()` and you're done. Somebody who understands programming will be able to tell me how to implement `sorted()` as pseudo code, which can then be used in any language. I have interviewed many candidates that couldn't write their own sorting algorithm because they only learnt how to use Python. They don't get job offers.
&gt; the Django ORM is hands down the best ORM available in any language It's not even the best Python ORM. The tooling around it (primarily, the admin panel) is what's the best.
No
In all the programming languages I've written in, I've started with microframeworks, written my own tooling/framework on top of that and then realized that bigger frameworks have already done it for me, then promptly switched for following projects.
There are contexts, where "program" and "application" mean different things. For instance, "program" means anything Python interpreter can parse without errors. So, for example: 42 is a program. # this is a comment is a program. But: for i in range(42): is not a program (it's not finished). Application, on the other hand, doesn't "work" in this context. It would be normally used to describe a program, that does something "useful" (whatever that means for the user).
Thank god for that
They're used pretty much interchangeably but in my opinion, a program is any set of code that can be processed by the CPU. An application is a program that can have user input after the program has started whether it's in CLI or a GUI.
I think yes. Definitely 
&gt; is it possible to use asyncio to achieve the same ? Some people look at a problem and think "this can be solved with threads". Now they have N problems.
I really enjoyed this course: "Learning Python for Data Analysis and Visualization" from Udemy by Jose PORTILLA ([https://www.udemy.com/learning-python-for-data-analysis-and-visualization/learn/v4/overview](https://www.udemy.com/learning-python-for-data-analysis-and-visualization/learn/v4/overview)) &amp;#x200B; It is made of 3 parts: 1. managing data with Pandas (wrangling, cleaning, getting higher level data...) 2. visualization (with Pandas, seaborn...) 3. machine learning The last part won't make you a machine learning engineer but it is a nice intro to this discipline. This course helped me a lot a my job (automotive engineer, not data scientist) to manage data from simulation, present results in the form of graphs... I even pushed my python skills to a desktop application for my job with a GUI and a SQL database, that's another topic but this online course was a great foundation.

&gt;To set up a Django app you have to learn its special ritual which can be a pain in the ass for a complete beginner. Truer words have never been spoken, I had to do the tutorials several times over to really get a hang of it. But once you do know the ritual it becomes quite easy. &gt; The official docs are not especially helpful for absolute beginners to be honest. The docs sometimes seem vague about what you should do and only state what you can do. Which leaves a world of possibilities but few standards (best practices) it seems. Moreover Django abstracts a lot of the complexities away from building a web app, thought this sometimes can leave you with more questions than answers as to how you should do something that's not explicit in the documentation. I recently was trying to setup channels in order to have a simple user notification, was a little frustrating to say the least. Without diving into the source code, along with outdated half-answered SO submissions I would still be stuck. Don't get me wrong, Django is an amazing tool for building webapps, just the learning curve can be a bit steep.

I think you're way better off jumping into Flask rather than Django if this is your goal. Django has a lot more features, but you will likely have no clue what they're doing for you or how to modify them. With Flask, it's dirt simple to just return HTML templates. From there, you can toy with some basic Jinja templating, then maybe adding some basic logic to change what shows up on the template, then slowly building from there to make whatever it is you want. With Django, you're jumping in the deep end immediately and the number of things you have to do and files to edit just to return a page can be pretty tedious. Could you follow a step-by-step instructional to make a good site? Sure, but ... as soon as you need to tweak it, you're going to be lost if you don't understand quite a few Python/programming paradigms. 
Thank god for that

&gt; if you're expecting the application to get bigger you'll be happier off if you started with Django instead of Flask. If your app gets much bigger you'll be happier picking a different language completely.
You can certainly find a tutorial to adapt to your needs, but you will probably spend most of your time fighting with the configuration and permissions on your work server. The docs assume some ability to place and run code in a trusted area, which may or may not be true depending on how your IT team set things up.
To clarify, tell r/learnpython what you’re trying to do. Your post does not belong in this sub. That’s made very clear in the sidebar.

For me, the difference becomes relevant in the context of python's packaging tools. If I'm developing scripts, stand alone applications like a to-do app, or tools to be used in my scripts or apps (aka libraries), they are all python programs. The difference between whether or not my 'program' is a script, an app or a library only becomes relevant to me when I wish to package them for reuse. Then I have to decide which option to use to install them. That means whether or not I wish to; 1. just copy the source code and directory tree structure, 2. create an installation which depends on running the command python setup.py 3. I want to install them using pip, 4. I want to use conda, 5. I want to run the script from the Linux command line (by using pipsi) 6. I want to use, pipenv, virtualenv, poetry and so on because I want to run them within a virtual environment. 7. I want to install them on Windows and so on. If my program is a 'library' , that means that it will be used by other apps. That either influences (or limits) the tools or manner in which I package them. For example, pipenv is not designed to manage versioning for libraries. If it's an application that I'm running in a virtualenv then pipenv is an option. And so on. All this to say, the type of python 'program' influences my packaging decisions. 
There’s no difference in meaning, just common usage. You tend to say “command-line program”, but “web (or GUI) application”.
You're going to need to store the image:tag mapping in DB regardless, if you want to do any querying on the tags. If you don't want to build the ML/AI models yourself, take a look at [https://imagga.com/solutions/auto-tagging.html](https://imagga.com/solutions/auto-tagging.html) At least you'd need to be familiar with a web framework like Django or Flask, and know how to use a DB
No. The gunicorn, supervisord and NGINX is a couple hours itself. 
It can be hit or miss. It depends on where a company stands in infrastructure, and how much really sits on IT. If there's a separate secops team, those roles don't really fall under IT, for instance. As others have pointed out, it very well may be my locale dictating higher salaries than anything. Boston is up there with San Francisco on rent prices and traffic, and tech is really booming in the area. The other thing you might consider, is a jump from IT, to a production supporting role. Operations is very similar to IT, just where your customers are real customers, and not necessarily internal employees.
Hello and greetings to everyone! &amp;#x200B; The script uses the same rules as the official mega millions lotto. &amp;#x200B; It allows a user to do one of three things: &amp;#x200B; 1. Interactively select MM numbers. 2. Hard-code a list of MM numbers. (selected by default) 3. Randomly select MM numbers. The program then checks if the randomly generated lotto numbers match the numbers selected in options 1, 2 or 3. &amp;#x200B; To "improve" a user's chances, the program keeps a list (running\_list) of the most recent winning numbers. Every 100,000 guesses, the program then finds the 5 most common numbers, and updates the chosen\_nums list to be these 5 numbers. The same process happens with the MegaBall number. &amp;#x200B; Using this simple program as a template, how could one implement the use of async or threading to allow for faster performance? &amp;#x200B; Are there any coding improvements to help the overall readability of the code? &amp;#x200B;
1) Why the fuck are you so aggressive ? Fucking bastard, if you don't like to help, then don't. Fuck off with that bitch ass attitude bloody cunt ass faggot. 2) I'll get paid or not is none of your fucking problem. Fucking cunt. 3) coming to excel . Do you own a fucking laptop ? Have you ever used a spreadsheet to see your monthly expenditure? No ? Not surprising given that a broke ass fuck like you would not need in the first place. Well let me educate you, excel let's you visualise data in tabular format which makes it easy for calculation and other mathematics related stuff. 4) Now, imagine a use case where you need to generate reports from existing database and email it to the clients. Something like a record of last 10 years academic break up of a student. ( Marks , attendance etc ). You ask why excel ? Well maybe the client requested it, that's why. Have I asked you to provide me a solution for that ? No ? Good , shut the fuck up now. 5) Oh and yes, I am using pandas to create the data frame. But how the fuck do you send the dataframe over email ? You need to write it to a file. CSV is the best format for my use case. Shut the fuck up if you haven't used it ever. Don't act smart when you are clearly not. All I asked was, is it possible to implement in async. All you had to do was provide a solution if you knew or shut the fuck up if you didn't. You fucking don't even know what's an excel. Fucking noob.
It's kinda the same thing, imo. Just named differently. 
Flask, yes! Django, probably not if you have to ask this Q.
Have you read PEP 492? It goes over some of the design motivations and things, and has a quick explanation of their reasoning for including an `async` keyword https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0492/#id86 Personally I quite like the way it is with the keywords, it's more akin to 'lifting' functions into a sort of async form like one would do in Haskell

For such a simple ETL task you may be best off just staying "frameworkless": * Reading records from mysql, deduping, then writing to csv is trivial to do with just python and a mysql driver * It uses almost nothing of value from Pandas * Doesn't require coordination between multiple tasks or jobs - where Airflow, etc would be valuable Unless you need to write a larger number of ETL jobs I would not immediately pull in any kind of framework. And if you just want it to run continuously, you can easily stay with cron - and up that game without much effort.
They do in Python...
I recommended [Godot Game Engine](https://godotengine.org/). Its own scripting language, GDScript, is very similar to Python.
Pyglet is pure Python. Pygame is more complete, as in has primitives for things like collision detection. Both have good support for OpenGL bindings if you need them. Pygame has a massive community around it, also, and for many people that's a really decisive factor.

probably not in a few hours. without knowing your requirements its impossible to provide a better estimate, but if you're starting from zero expect to sink a couple of days into learning the basics.

Lol 
Flask.
It’s essential to separate synchronous functions from asynchronous ones because a synchronous call in the wrong place can completely ruin an asynchronous program (and vice versa). Python isn’t JS. There is no implicit event loop. It must be explicit, and as we know, “Explicit is better than implicit.”
&gt; Get rid of the await keyword and implicitly await all asynchronous functions when they're called. In order to run multiple asynchronous functions simultaneously, we would use futures. You see, the async-await model (which I don't like very much) has a bunch of almost deliberately conflated selling points: 1. It's more efficient than using OS threads for massively concurrent IO bound tasks. 2. It provides a synchronization model that makes it almost entirely unnecessary to use locks. What you propose destroys the second property. Not that it's a very good property, it directly conflicts the first property because it doesn't scale to multicore (not that it's important for Python because GIL), it doesn't scale in software development sense because you have these two types of functions with "async" infecting everything up the call stack. But it's necessary because then you know that any code between two awaits is an implicit critical section and you don't have to take a lock whenever you mutate shared state, and we don't have anything better in Python anyways, and so the people who use async-await come to rely on that stuff. If you don't want that property then you might want to take a look at gevent for example. It doesn't do any async/await stuff in the first place, instead replacing most usual blocking operations with versions that return to and back from the event loop invisibly for the caller.
Why lol?
currently on some web scrapping project as well. i've been using web drivers(chrome/phantomjs) for heavy DOM implementation sites. whereas i used request for sites with lesser DOM implementation
He's basically quantifying how useless his opinion Is before he spouts it.
Probably the correct answer. I'm a full-time Django dev now, but the framework was deeply confusing at first (even with a solid Python background.)
The only reason I could find there is &gt;async/await is not a new concept in programming languages. \[...\] This is a huge benefit, as some users already have experience with async/await, and because it makes working with many languages in one project easier Which seems like a very weak reason considering that we could've had much more convenient asynchrony and avoided introducing 2 new keywords as well as asynchronous copies of many, many dundermethods. &amp;#x200B;
&gt; However its a bummer that you’ll need a subscription to scrape as much as you want w/out getting your IP blocked What? Elaborate please?
For completeness, there's also [Arcade](http://arcade.academy), which "has the same target audience as the well-known Pygame library" ([comparison](http://arcade.academy/pygame_comparison.html)). I have minimal experience with either but found the Arcade documentation and API easier to follow.
Thanks for the response, but I don't understand why making the `await` implicit makes locking necessary. Making `await` implicit doesn't mean that functions could be halted at any time, so those "implicit critical sections" between two `await`s would still exist. As far as I can tell, making `await` implicit shouldn't have an effect on the order of execution of your code.
A program is an executable. No more, no less. An application is a system that solves a problem or addresses one or more use-cases. A program can be an application, but only if it is a complete solution. In the common usage, they are conflated to mean the same thing. As a developer, it may not be a good idea to think that way. Unless you enjoy working in monolithic codebases.

If you couldn't get a hello world page up in two days, you've approached it in something seriously wrong direction. There's a tutorial on the official website that tells you literally everything you need to do to get it working. You could even copy-paste the code snippets if you were particularly lazy.
I dunno, lots of big stuff is written in Django. The only thing about it that I'd want changed for a very large application is static typing, which of course essentially proves your point.
What's the difference between `Future(x)` and `await x` in your mind exactly? The `async` keyword is less necessary as it can be automatically inferred, but see 'Importance of "async" keyword' in PEP 492 for their rationale for adding that Or maybe I'm misunderstanding what you're asking?
I have to say it took me two weeks before I got there in a good way. My lack of understanding and inability to find a simple guide that explains high level that the flow is something along the lines of URL dispatcher &gt; view &gt; template didn't help much. The rest was easier and just time taken to figure stuff out. Agreed day 1 flask is easier.
When i was scraping whosampled.com I made too many Requests (like 200/min)

Typosquatting is pretty common. Pretty much every popular package is a target. Also really common with websites.
&gt; How does separating synchronous functions from asynchronous functions help you not ruin your asynchronous program? Because they're clearly marked by the various async keywords, making it less likely that you'll forget which is which. &gt; How is that a reason to make everything explicit and error prone? Error prone? How do you figure that?
In multithreaded programs the code executed in a thread is periodically implicitly interrupted and the execution is turned to another thread. Instead, `await` keyword allows interrupting the execution explicitly, within single thread. The case there is that in async program a long-running blocking code prevents handling any events by the event loop, so that the entire program is halted. Consider an example: a user sends a request to our program, but right now we're so busy that can receive it. So the user just gets "The server did not respond" error or so. Instead we should periodically interrupt our heavy calculations to check if here is any incoming request. That’s why in async program any long-running blocking code should: a) be moved to a separate thread or a process, to not block current thread; b) be split to relatively small steps with explicit `await` between them, to return the control to the event loop.
&gt; The implicit event loop isn't what the issue OP complains about I know. Did you read the first paragraph of my comment? &gt; explicit event loops are a bane in the few languages that implement them, including Python. How so?
&gt; The fact of the matter is that you have to know whether the function you're calling is synchronous or asynchronous. That is true regardless of whether the await is explicit or implicit. If await is explicit then you get a more or less obvious error (compile time even in better languages) instead of hard to track race conditions. &gt; With explicit awaits you don't have the option of not giving a shit. It's impossible to reliably communicate that you give a shit to someone reading and modifying your code, nor to someone maintaining the functions you call so they don't make them async. As I said, check out gevent, it does pretty much what you want and with a benefit of not performing the anal touring maneuver of implementing implicit asyncio on top of explicit. Though God may have mercy on your soul if you decide that you don't have to use synchronization primitives because you always know which functions might do IO.
Eh, that's a valid alternative approach.

I've seen a few games posted here in the past week or two, so I thought I'd share something I made over the past year - a two-stick shooter written in python + pygame called TEACHERQUEST: Oklahoma. It's installed as an arcade game in an old school desk ((this one)[https://imgur.com/a/XJPksYE]) that has a Raspberry Pi 3B stuck inside of it.
You could but it wouldn't be enjoyable. If you want to enjoy creating web apps use Flask!
Whoops replied to the wrong comment. But yea, implicit should be avoided where possible.
So how does knowing that a function is synchronous help you not ruin your asynchronous program? You still have to call the function, and that will block. The reason why an explicit `await` keyword can cause errors is because you can forget to use it. Every single time you call a function, you have to know whether that function is synchronous or asynchronous. If calling an asynchronous function would implicitly await it and return its result, that would be *much* more convenient and less likely to cause stupid bugs.
1.Nobody told me my approach was dumb. The only arrogant bastard in the entire comment section is you. Let me ask you something, do you even understand how threading and coroutines work? Like have you actually worked on them, or was your advice based on what Google search told you ? 2. The client requires the report in CSV/Excel format. The database (MySQL) shouldn't be accessible to the end user. Hence the entire process of fetching data from DB and making a report out of it in CSV. I wouldn't expect a noob to know how ERP systems work but if you get time from getting roasted on the internet, look up on how ERP systems generate reports. That might give you an idea of how real world software engineering works Lastly, take your attitude somewhere else you fucking bastard. Accusing others of lack of knowledge when you yourself couldn't provide a simple solution. Somebody with 0 post history is gonna teach me professionalism, fucking burger flipping piece of shit. It's people like you who made SO a shithole. And as far as payment goes, this is a hobby project. If you knew how much I earn in RL, you probably would be sucking my cock for cash. Stay the fuck away from this thread. I do not want to engage with you anymore. 
I would personally just then write statically typed python through mypy. It's actually pretty decent for large program stuff.
A lot of things are implicit in pythons. Like variable declarations. Referring to PEP20 isn't an argument, and blindly making everything explicit would be stupid.
I read the first paragraph, but then you added the explicit event loop nonsense out of place making zero sense. Explicit event loops are extremely complicated to work with. Whereas in lamguages like C#, JS, the event loop / microtask queue is implicit, you can call asynchronous functions from the current parent thread and interweave them with synchronous functions right off the bat. It just *works*, batteries go in simply, rather than you having to wire up capacitors in series. Now in C# if you really want to you can dig in to the internals if you choose to use capacitors in series rather than double a batteries, but that's a very rare need to do so. Even asyncio admitted it's mistake and implemented a `run` function to simplify needing to set up the event loop, but it is extremely inefficient because it closes and reopens a loop each time it is called. Furthermore the default event loop in C#/JS is *smart*-- it exists on a separate thread, allowing synchronous code to be asynchronous from asynchronous code, which fundamentally makes sense-- synchronous code is a series of instructions that depend on each other, and may at some point depend on asynchronous code running in the background, but not directly dependent on it. While you can do this in Python it requires a lot of set up. I'm in the process of writing a thin wrapper around asyncio that solves these two issues, but it's dependent on a Task primitive which doesn't exist in asyncio.Task (which by the way asyncio tasks aren't actual tasks as one thinks about them in other languages, which is just *strange*), so it's taking longer than I hoped to get up and running due to work being a priority.
These are entirely different models of asynchonous computation in major ways then The intent, as far as I can tell from PEP 492, is to add first class syntax for the coroutine style of asynchronous computation specifically and not something more akin to Promises/Futures Promises and futures are actually already in the Python standard since 3.4 or so (PEP 3156) via the asyncio module, is that more what you're looking for? One can actually `await` a Future or a Task in the same way as the standard coroutine, so which you choose depends on what type of async programming you're intending to use
Hedge funds are young companies trying to find news ways to make money. Harvesting data and scarping apis, trying to compile databases and interfaces to these databases to find ways to utilise all this data to make money. There's little regulation and little 'corporate red tape'. So while places like banks are worth considering due to reputation and some level of job security. Hedge funds are far more experimental with far less regulation so they're effectively programming petri dishes. Hundreds of just graduated programmers with core knowledge but little experience, set loose to practise and let loose. Java, python, sql, all great things to learn the basics of. Also I'd suggest get some basic understanding of navigating around a linux operating system both gui and command line. If advanced maths isn't a strong point, there's always web development teams, or the finance teams rather than the hard coding/math teams.
Ah, also doing that, haha. Thanks
What device are you specifically talking about? It is possible, although unlikely that there is a library to read the data from it. But it is much more likely that you will need to use whatever low-level protocol the device "speaks" and interpret the data yourself. Check the devices manual.
Will have a look. Thanks

Sick AG later scanning lidar sensor. And I'm currently using pylidar for the communication, but the issue is with the code itself, so I'm just trying to find out I'd theres anyone who's done it before and might know what I should include in my code

&gt; but the issue is with the code itself If you provide the code and describe the "issues" in more detail, maybe someone can help you. Otherwise, the library you are using has some examples(that look pretty useful to me).
&gt; Coding should be fun and belittling people is not cool. See yourself out.
Sure I'll post the code once I edit it and highlight the issues. And i saw the examples, they were useful but to an extent. Any help will be appreciated :)
I do not get why you are so upset. Go re-read my answers to you and see how out of your mind you are right now. The only possible way I could have insulted you imo is with the "the hell are you doing". If that sets you off this much then why are you posting on a public forum as for other people calling you dumb for one there this very sarcastic way of saying it (though I can not seem to recall the source... pity) &gt;&gt;In theory, sure. You just need an asyncio-compatible SMTP library. &gt;&gt;It's also absolutely fine to do in a thread. 
Haha yeah, Robotron 2084 was the visual &amp; gameplay model I worked off of - I tried to replicate most of the effects as closely as I could.
I recommend posting the code either as a github gist, or better as a gitlab project(if it is more than one file).
PEP 3156 is probably more relevant than PEP 492, thanks. (Because I want to know why the concept of `await`ing is explicit, not why we got an `await` keyword as a replacement for `yield from`.) It's an awfully long read though...
&gt; I do think it's possible to clearly communicate your giving a shit about race conditions to other people though. A `with account_balance_lock:` should be enough to make that abundantly obvious. Yes, and having mandatory `await`s is an alternative to that, that, believe it or not, is actually much nicer in a range of application sizes. Because locks suck, the relationship between the data and the lock(s) that protect it are not explicit in the code, while with `await`s you know that all data accesses between awaits are absolutely safe. Note that I don't like async/await very much and prefer to use message queues/channels, along with enlightened users of gevent.
You did things wrong and I pointed them out. If you would like to retaliate then provide a counter argument to defend your stance not downvote me and pout about internet bullies. In my opinion being blunt is the best way to expose dunning kruger effect. In my opinion you have it. In your opinion I have it. I would like you to calm down and keep the "fuckers and bastards" out of the conversion and keep this conversation civil and code related. If you can not provide me with civil counter arguments to my points then I have no further comment.
If you’re trying to store and retrieve python objects or classes, use pickle. CSV is a good choice tabular data. 
Tabular dada?
Here we go again blind profanity to vent your rage
What do you mean by a CLI framework? Argparse provides a good CLI. Also I don't really see what advantage there is to defining any objects here.

Hi there, from the /r/Python mods. We have removed this post as it is not suited to the /r/Python subreddit proper, however it should be very appropriate for our sister subreddit /r/LearnPython or for the r/Python discord: https://discord.gg/3Abzge7. The reason for the removal is that /r/Python is dedicated to discussion of Python news, projects, uses and debates. It is not designed to act as Q&amp;A or FAQ board. The regular community is not a fan of "how do I..." questions, so you will not get the best responses over here. On /r/LearnPython the community and the r/Python discord are actively expecting questions and are looking to help. You can expect far more understanding, encouraging and insightful responses over there. **No matter what level of question you have, if you are looking for help with Python, you should get good answers**.

Hello, I made a package called [messages](https://github.com/trp07/messages) that is also on PyPI. I have an email module with a **.send_async()** function. I'd love for you to try it out and see if it solves your use-case. Or, if you try it and decide it doesn't work, get some feedback on what could make it better.
Thank you so much. I'll give it a try and let you know.
Data which can be represented as a table - where one object is a row and each field is a column. Think excel spreadsheets.
requirements.txt is not there 
Tabular data is like a spreadsheet in row column format. These are dumped out as strings to a CSV file like an Excel spreadsheet with column names. 
Is SQLAlchemy your preference? I've never _really_ done a deep dive with it, but I've always been bummed working with it when I'm building Flask applications, knowing that Django's ORM is right around the corner. I could see SQLAlchemy being more powerful, but the Django ORM feels so intuitive in comparison.
After reading the chapter you metion I think what the author is advocating is essentially unittests in the code. Here are some parts that make me think this. It would be a good idea if you tested some asserts that should never fail. The problem I see is that on a large project I think you would find that the code acted differently with asserts enabled vs disabled. Just write seperate unittests. ``` "You see, the proper use of assertions is to inform developers about unrecoverable errors in a program. Assertions are not intended to signal expected error conditions, like a File-Not-Found error, where a user can take corrective actions or just try again." This is his do example " def apply_discount(product, discount): price = int(product['price'] * (1.0 - discount)) assert 0 &lt;= price &lt;= product['price'] return price " One of his do not example " def delete_product(prod_id, user): assert user.is_admin(), 'Must be admin' assert store.has_product(prod_id), 'Unknown product' store.get_product(prod_id).delete() " He realises asserts can be turned off by passing a flag. "Take a close look at this delete_product function. Now, what’s going to happen if assertions are disabled?" ``` 
Flatten the nested list first, and then calculate the average.
Why? What is wrong with SQL? 1,000 different abstraction tools already.
Which language?
CSV's fine, some sort of relational database (e.g. SQLite) might be better if you don't need it to be human readable. JSON is extremely portable and good for heterogeneous data (i.e. stuff it'd be awkward to put in a database). Don't get me wrong, pickle has its place - no other serialisation can dump and load pure python objects. But it's not a good long-term solution, because the pickle spec can change; it's not safe, because it executes arbitrary code; it's not particularly high-performing, and nothing but python can read/write it.
Honest question, in hopes of finding why people stick with Python 2. Is there a reason you wrote this in legacy Python vs Python 3?
Define the running total variable inside the function and when you recursively call the function you will have a new variable with the same name, but it won't overwrite the old one. When the function returns, the old variable will still be there. Hope that helps, but it's hard to know exactly where you are stuck without more description or what code you have so far. Also /r/LearnPython is a better place for questions like this.
Probably the one that searches r/python and /r/learnpython for questions that get asked all the time.
short answer: no
`pytest` (sane unit tests), `ipython` (much improved REPL), `flake8` (linter/static analyser), `black` (code formatter), and `tox` (virtual environment manager for running tests against lots of different python versions) are in pretty much all of my repositories. `bumpversion` (version management) makes it into anything I'm releasing. `requests` is essential for anything involving the web (unless I'm scraping a JS-heavy site, then unfortunately I'm tied to selenium). `numpy`, `pandas`, often various `scikit`s for doing numerical things.
You could but it would be some work to right it out and read it in then parse then assign attributes. As a jumping off point try and do something like ``` import json file_name = "save_object_state.json" my_object =YourClass() with open(file_name, 'w') as f: json.dump(my_object.__dict__, f) ``` This code is probably wrong but you basically take your instantiated class and dump it's `__dict__` to json When you read it back in you can do ``` file_name = "save_object_state.json" my_object =YourClass() with open(file_name, 'r') as f: Json_data = json.load( f) my_object.___dict__.update(json_data) ```
 Isn't json or a relational database a bit overkill though? I don't see how their pros relate to my program. It's just a simple save thing for an object that only has name (of the character which is different from the "call name" before any confusion), level, exp, stats (which are calculated off level) and some functions within the class that just gets those variables and can do a level up. I just realised all of this can be recreated. Maybe I don't need to save the object itself and can just save the "__init__" variables within the csv file along with its "call name" and recreate the object every time I load up the save file. That could work.
&gt; aybe I don't need to save the object itself and can just save the " &gt; init &gt; " variables within the csv file along Exactly. It could look something like this: ```python import csv from typing import Tuple, Iterable, Iterator import os class MyClass: def __init__(self, var1, var2, var3): self.var1 = var1 self.var2 = var2 self.var3 = var3 def to_tuple(self) -&gt; Tuple: return self.var1, self.var2, self.var3 @classmethod def many_to_csv(cls, my_instances: Iterable[MyClass], path: os.PathLike): with open(path, 'w') as f: writer = csv.writer(f) for instance in my_instances: writer.writerow(instance.to_tuple()) @classmethod def from_csv(cls, path: os.PathLike) -&gt; Iterator[MyClass]: with open(path) as f: reader = csv.reader(f) for row in reader: yield cls(*row) characters = [ MyClass("Boris", 5, 10), MyClass("Dave", 25, 30), MyClass("Angela", 82, 12), ] MyClass.many_to_csv(characters, "characters.csv") retrieved_characters = MyClass.from_csv("characters.csv") ``` That should produce a CSV like ``` "Boris",5,10 "Dave",25,30 "Angela",82,12 ```
Not really anything to do with Python here. However, my guess is that you could not do this with any sort of accuracy without taking exacting measurements of the environment.
Yeah, that's a good question. I came to Python through working with Raspberry Pis, and a lot of the tutorial/introductory material is Python 2, so that's what I learned, and by the time I knew enough about Python to know I should be probably be using Python 3, the habits were already in place. I've actually been trying to switch my coding to Python 3 (which isn't that hard - nothing I write is very complicated so I don't need to make very many changes) but going back and updating older projects is sort of a low priority right now, so most of my stuff is still Python 2.
To get Python 3.6 on my Raspberry Pis, I had to build it. However, 3.4 is very easy to get on there. Each piece of code you write in 2.7 will have to be updated sometime. If you are running projects properly in virtual environments, then it is easy to start a new project properly.
The class has "get" functions for all variables though. Could just easily use those get functions, assign to variables and write in appropriate order to the csv file. No need to use os or anything from typing. No need to add stuff to pre-existing classes.
To be honest, 'I have a four-year degree and some Python knowledge' isn't much of a pitch. My company isn't hiring (this month, anyway), but when we do, the emphasis is always on 'what have you done, and what skills do you have'. If someone who wants to work with data can't tell that story well, they likely won't do well in the work (in our experience).
Do all objects have the same numbre and names of field?
Oh man, Robotron 2084! One of Williams' best!
The only real difference between the objects is that the classes they are created from have different stat calculation. Other than that the only way to tell the objects apart are the variables within the "init" function. 
Yeah, and after this conversation I'm probably going to look into building 3.6 on a Pi (or just installing whatever version of 3 apt has available). But another reason I do things like use legacy Python and don't set up virtual environments for projects is that I mostly view coding as a means to an end - I'm more interested in game and physical case design, interactive effects design, etc, and I typically learn just enough to be able to do what I need to, programming-wise, and then switch my focus to other things (CAD, figuring out what finish to use on spraypainted MDF, etc.) And because of this orientation to coding, I don't really think of myself as a programmer, and I think I don't approach questions like this (2.7 v 3.4+) as a programmer. And so, if the question is, is there some reason I think python 2.7 or whatever is better, the answer is no; but if the question is, is there a reason I don't do things the right way, there is, but it's probably not very satisfying to anyone but myself.
Getting the first job is definitely the hardest part. I don't know if I can offer tips but I can tell you how I did it and you can see how much of it you can apply to your own search. My first job after college was at an insurance company as a claims adjuster. I decided to try my hand at taking some actuarial exams and passed the first two, which I shamelessly self promoted to my boss, my boss's boss and anyone else who would listen. I worked my ass off at my regular job all the while and made sure to be one of the best on the team. I never actually got a job as an actuary, but my boss's boss one day told me about a project he was starting and offered me a role as a jr data analyst for it. The salary offer was very low but I still took it thinking it was the best opportunity I was gonna get to break into the data field. 4 years later and a couple of team changes as projects came and went, I started to realize I was better than the other analysts but my pay was still low, so I asked for a raise and a promotion but was told I wasn't ready for it. So I found a job elsewhere, and two jobs later I'm now making almost double that initial salary. No one cares about my degree at this point and I'm about 6 years into this career. So my advice, based on my experience, would be to get an unrelated job at a large company, work your ass off, develop your skills on your own time, self-promote, network, and be prepared in case that random opportunity comes along. Also be willing to accept a salary that's on the low side for at least the first job.

Flask ftw. 
I'll take a look at gevent, but I was mostly wondering if there was something wrong with my understanding of async and why it was implemented this way.
Im not sure this answers your question directly, but it could be useful for other projects if it isnt. &amp;#x200B; For CSVs you dont need any special imports, you can just use native python. Here is a peice of code I wrote a while ago: filename="[FILE NAME GOES HERE]"+".csv" \# creates a new excel spreadsheet in write mode f=open(filename,"w") \# creates headers headers = "[DATA POINT 1],[MORE DATA STUFF],[ETC]\n" f.write(headers) f.close() This was for a web scraping program, so I only added the data later on. I did this in a for loop to retrieve all the pieces of data I needed, assigning all of them to variables, and finally writing them all to the file in lines like so: filename="[FILE NAME GOES HERE]"+".csv" f=open(filename,"a") f.write(DataVariable1 + "," + DataVariable2 + "," + ETC +"\n") As you can see, CSV files separate cells with a comma, so you could have the start of every row be a character or item and then store their values in the following columns, such as Value, hitpoints etc. This could be especially useful for editing the stats of enemies or items in your game as you would easily be able to change it from the csv file and then read the csv on launch of the game. &amp;#x200B;
Awesome thanks for the link! I wasn’t able to find anything myself so thank you! 
[Pythonwheels](https://pythonwheels.com/) shows the most downloaded packages from PyPI that have been uploaded as wheel archives. It's a bit low level but makes for an interesting browse.
Edited my post to add more information. There's also an existing github project in Python that someone wrote as a proof of concept for exactly this: https://github.com/rodrigoalvesvieira/SoundKeylogger
Holy cow, and I thought I was clever for thinking of it! Thanks for this information I’m gonna start reading! Your the best! 
More motivated than I apparently, or at least smarter in what words to keyword in your search :D
It's definitely the google foo. The word you're looking for is "keylogger", and then mixing that up with "audio" or "sound based" starts giving you results, then you read some of those and improve your search with "Hardware Acoustic Keyloggers" and "Acoustic Cryptanalysis" ;)
Pretty much anytime you want to gather data from websites that either don't offer an API or charge for access to it.
You are one clever man. gonna be researcher this for sure now, and maybe even trying to develop my own project
Ah sounds very interesting, thank you!
Cool, good luck!
&gt; the important parts are the ability to snapshot and start over Or you could use Git.
Python has a [`csv`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html) module. There's also the [`pickle`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html) module you may consider for persisting state. Be sure to read this module's warnings on security. Read our sidebar and visit /r/learnpython in the future for these sort of questions.
Also rather than packages=['dotini'] in the setup.py, just use find_packages. Although it doesn't matter quite as much for a small project like this with just one module and one file, but find_packages also finds packages recursively, packages=['dotini'] won't pick up sub-packages, you would basically need packages=['dotini', 'ditin.subpackage'] etc, that is why we use find_packages.
First time using classes so I'm just going off what I've heard/seen before. If you get the hint I'm doing "wrong" or "bad" please point it out. I'll keep in mind the return thing in the future but it's all over my code now and that's just tedious replacement for no benefit when I could just develop the program more. If I'm wrong about that though, please tell me. As much as I like to think I'm good at programming I haven't even worked with classes properly until now so. Maybe I misunderstood your code but couldn't I just simply iterate over my character list containing the call names of the objects, each loop assigning all the init values and the class type to variables and then upload (maybe you don't need to assign to variables and just call upon then when uploading) them to the csv file (first checking if it already existed and overwrite if it does). That doesn't seem like it would be too many lines. Just a loop and a few assignments (if that's even necessary), upload and repeat loop with next character. Only the get stats is unique compared to other get functions since stats is a dictionary. Just returns the specified stat. It's not that I can't change the original classes, it is that I don't see the need to (if there isn't anything wrong with my logic) it's that there's, to quote myself, "no need to" as far as I can see. Side note: how would sub classing solve that?
What are the differences when compared to Peewee?
In one of the links provided I found a presentation where there theory was you could take the different electrical pulses from a wall outlet that are being omitted from a PC do to how ps/2 ports send data... Crazy to think
What are you typing in?
use a text editor
I followed the debate with great interest around 2010 to 2012, played with yield from, and had my own version of gevent. I switched to Go due to constant issues in Python with trying to use implicitly asynchronous wrappers without language support. Now the async keyword stuff is everywhere and it just looks like function colouring hell. It's like the Python 3 split again but now at the library level.
Sounds like you’re using a command line terminal of some sort. Once you hit enter, you can’t go back - you’ve feed that info to the computer and it’s waiting for its next instruction. Quitting the terminal and restarting is the easiest way to reset the terminal. As someone else recommended, you need to use a text editor of some sort in order to write a script/program that you can edit, run, edit again, run again, etc. Common text editors for programming include pycharm, sublime text, VS Code, and IDLE. Look up some videos on YouTube about using an IDE for python, I think that will help you understand what you’re doing wrong and visuals always help. 
Some various thoughts off the top of my head. 1. Your hypothetical example would require more changes throughout the whole library. For example `time.sleep` would have to be made event-loop aware. Gevent/eventlet does this by monkey-patching the standard library, but regardless it would require a lot of changes across all of python. 2. The async/await sort of syntax is used in other languages to varying degrees so this breeds developer familiarity...an important and often under-appreciated priority. 3. The explict-ness of async/await falls on the right side of the "how explicit do we want to make things?" question for the developers. I don't think there's anything necessarily _wrong_ with the way you want to do it, but like many language design decisions there is a web of priorities and interests that go into the end product. &gt; Surely this would be much more convenient than python's current async model? FWIW, I do not agree with this. Or, at least, I do not think that it is readily apparent that this is so. Arguments for implicit behavior almost always start with this sort of question, and _often_ it just doesn't hold up in the real world.
Could be a number of reasons. Posting sample code would be a good start.
You show show properly formatted code, preferably hosted on github gist or pastebin. In any case, you probably have a logic issue, i.e. the code doesn't do what you think it does, or an indentation issue. BTW /r/learnpython is more appropriate for this kind of question
You have some code to show us? Best guess at this stage would be some kind of scope problem.
If you are looking for simple GUI, and you are using Python, then [Tkinter](https://wiki.python.org/moin/TkInter) is also an option.
Ah, sounds like you’re writing directly in the Python interpreter, so it’s evaluating each line after you press enter. Try writing your code in a text file (usually they have a .py extension) and passing that to the interpreter in terminal, like so: $ python anonymousse100.py 
I just ported a large project (50K LOC) completely to async. I changed thousands of lines of code. First, I love the async model and everything about it. However, I really shouldn't have had to do all that work. It isn't just adding a bunch of `async` and `await` everywhere. It is converting every `for` loop into an `async for` loop. It is converting every context manager and list comprehension into an async one. It is converting `yield from` back into regular loops. It is rearchitecting things if you have a generator expression. Essentially there are two syntaxes now, one for async functions and one for non-async, and they haven't transitioned all the syntax from non-async to async yet. Essentially, when you mark a function as async, you're telling the interpreter that someone, maybe 7 layers deep, might wait on a OS object. You could have 99% of your code be non-async, but because of that one dude (probably waiting on a socket), thousands of lines of code have to change. This viral nature of async is bad. I don't mind marking the functions, I do mind converting code from one syntax to another simply because it makes the interpreter slightly easier to implement. If an async function calls another async function, the await should be implicit. There should be some other keyword to \*NOT\* await on a called coroutine. In this way, you wouldn't have to rewrite every function.
Either pygame or pyqt5. Pygame gives you more low level control, while pyqt5 allows you to easily integrate your visualization into a complete GUI. There is also [kivy](https://kivy.org/doc/stable/api-kivy.graphics.instructions.html).

cheers for the response. what subreddit do you recommend me reposting this to? i just assumed since i was writing in python i’d use the python subreddit. my bad tho.
By following the SUPER SIMPLE directions I gave you. I'll spell it out for you: R E A D T H E S I D E B A R
Just because a function is synchronous doesn't mean it blocks. There's nothing that prevents one from blocking in an async function. Adding required parameters that doesn't actually enforce the behavior you're looking for can be better implemented with code comments.
Are you building new sites with it, or maintaining a number of sites that run django?
Just because a function is synchronous doesn't mean it blocks. Also it is perfectly legal to call \`time.sleep(10000)\` in an async function. In other words, its blocking behavior is orthogonal to whether a function is marked \`async\`. Adding required syntax that doesn't actually enforce the behavior you're looking for can be better implemented with code comments.
First of all, why Django? Secondly, why any server-side web framework? That said, Django is pretty simple to learn. 
I don't mean to come off rude, so I hope you don't take it that way, but I'm going to rant a little. It amazes me how many people jump straight into learning how to code without first learning how an operating system works and learning some things about systems, networking, hardware, etc. In the Enterprise IT world, you really see it quite often, though it seems more common with C# and Java developers. They are no different from the annoying lady in accounting who has no business touching a computer, as the only thing she knows how to do is use the software she does most of her work in, and to anything else she's clueless and oblivious. These types of developers knows their IDE and local Dev pipeline, and otherwise can't figure out how to troubleshoot a blank monitor, add a printer, fix an email sync issue, etc. I'm happy that you're taking the step to learn Python, but it sounds like you're very green still. I would personally urge you to take your time and learn systems a bit first. Just some simple googling and setting up a Linux server will have you editing config files from the command line, modifying network settings, learning to troubleshoot, etc. Go tinker. You'll start to encounter and learn things that you don't even realize you're learning, such as the difference between compiled and interpreted code, and how to execute a script.
Use random library. Generate random number between 0-1. If 0, false, else true.

Fuck, dude. Google the name of your Reddit app and “sidebar”. 
consider not being an asshole dude, this isn’t stackoverflow this guy clearly had no idea what he’s doing, if you’re not interested in helping just leave it alone. mods can decide if it’s worth deleting or not. 
Nice to see a slightly different approach to the lotto program that a lot of people will try - being done from the point of view of having a lump sum to use up over many draws. I am not sure how the MegaMillions draw works but your programs allows the same number multiple times, I would guess your 5 numbers cannot be the same in which case you want to make use of the random.sample command. Also as far as I can make out you are only recording the mega all in the special running order when it matches your chosen one, perhaps the append should go at the top of the loop when you append the standard balls. Nice work though, I like the options to use set numbers, random numbers or best numbers. On average how many draws does it take until the winnings expire? 
Nice try, but that doesn't do what stated.
I'd say it's a combination of lack of familiarity with good implementations on the part of the core developers (people who decide what goes into language, and they aren't very bright, especially when it comes to knowing stuff about other languages). A fashion (that's been already mentioned here). And a fear of change (when you don't understand how your code works, you are afraid of changing it; Python interpreter is a 90% duct tape and 10% code that makes sense, trying to induce a major change into it is a fool's errand).
Good point
That’s elegant. Nice.
If you develop this further, I would strongly advise you to use a more robust way of parsing and searching HTML. Your current approach of literal text matching and regex is bad and it is guaranteed to break. lxml or BeautifulSoup are commonly used libraries that can be used to extract data from HTML in a more reliable way.
Fuck of with that. If dude can’t be bothered to do a bare minimum of googling to figure out what the fuck a sidebar is, I’m not going to be polite about telling him exactly how to do it. 
SQLAlchemy definitely has a steep learning curve, but I really enjoy it after having spent the time to learn it. 
wow you really are an arse aren’t you? i’ve made such an effort to be nice and put up with all your shit so i could get a decent response and not this crap. like jeez if i can be a decent human being when a wank stain like you is chatting shit for no reason, i think you could be nice when being respected wayyy more than you ever deserved. i get it’s a stupid question for a tosspot loner like you who’s spent 8 years on this site, but for someone who only used this to ask dumb questions, you just seem like a bit of a dickhead.
&gt; I'll keep in mind the return thing in the future but it's all over my code now and that's just tedious replacement for no benefit when I could just develop the program more. Sure thing. Getters and setters are ubiquitous in languages which care about access control (like Java), and so a lot of tutorials disregard what is idiomatic for the language they're using and throw them in anyway. In python, it's considered that we're all consenting adults, so all member variables are accessible. If you *don't* want someone to touch a member variable, you can let them know that with a name starting with an underscore. Just keep it in mind next time and it should save you some effort! &gt; As much as I like to think I'm good at programming I haven't even worked with classes properly until now so. Maybe I misunderstood your code but couldn't I just simply iterate over my character list containing the call names of the objects, each loop assigning all the init values and the class type to variables and then upload (maybe you don't need to assign to variables and just call upon then when uploading) them to the csv file (first checking if it already existed and overwrite if it does). That doesn't seem like it would be too many lines. Just a loop and a few assignments (if that's even necessary), upload and repeat loop with next character. Yes, that's certainly possible and definitely not incorrect. It's purely a matter of style, which can be subjective. If I'm learning a new module and there's a piece of functionality which only ever acts on one class, and certainly if it's involved in the instantiation of that class (e.g. reading it from a CSV), I'm much more likely to A) find it and B) remember to use it if it's actually part of the class definition. Classes define a state (with variables) and a behaviour (with methods), and this smells more like class behaviour than it does a free-floating procedure (i.e. a top level function). Again, though, just a matter of preference. One instance in which it might be beneficial to define the behaviour on the class would be if you had a subclass of `MyClass` - in your case, maybe an NPC or a swarm or something. Something which has all the attributes of a `MyClass`, plus a couple extra. All you'd need to do for that subclass is to override `to_tuple` and you'd get the CSV reading and writing for free, whereas with a free-floating function you'd need to define a whole new one for each new subclass. Also, if you ever edited `MyClass`, the serialisation/deserialisation implementations are right there so you're more likely to remember to change those as well, where you may not if they're buried somewhere else in your codebase. It doesn't make a big difference if you're working with one small script, but for bigger projects it's a good habit to be in. &gt; It's not that I can't change the original classes, it is that I don't see the need to (if there isn't anything wrong with my logic) it's that there's, to quote myself, "no need to" as far as I can see. Python is a Turing-complete language. So is [brainfuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck). You don't "need to" write in Python, you can just write in brainfuck. However, we choose to write in python because it's easier to read, easier to write, more maintainable, more useful to others. Idiomatic, good-looking code isn't just a "nice to have" - it's the second most important thing about developing software. &gt; Side note: how would sub classing solve that? In the event that `MyClass` were defined in someone else's library, and didn't have serialisation/deserialisation, and you wanted to add it, you could subclass their `MyClass` and just add those new methods. Then by using your subclass, you get to use all their functionality, while still having the benefits of those methods being defined on the class. Just to be clear. I'm going into a lot of depth here not to be a dick, but because this is /r/Python, where the language itself is discussed, rather than /r/learnpython, where people learning the language should go to get help for a minimal working example.
woah really? do you mind explaining why? As someone who used to work with django a lot, I felt like demand for django apps wasn't that high, as anything web is dominated by js, everyone just wants a mean stack
&gt; The reason why an explicit await keyword can cause errors is because you can forget to use it. I love the async model in python and take it as one of the reasons to be better explicitly, but I have this gripe too where I wish python told me that I'm creating a co-routine object without storing its reference somewhere. Mypy doesn't have anything to detect this either (afaik), and it's a simple check that could help a lot. In other languages like in javascript, async functions preempt as soon as they're called, but in python they have to be somehow preempted through an async syntax or placed somewhere to start at a later time. And it's bitten me a few times in python where I call an async function and forget to do something with the coroutine object. 
Once again, thanks. I've been messing around with it and did some [terrain generation](http://prntscr.com/ledpws) thanks to you. I definitely love Arcade.
It is bit dated.. if you make use of the django documentation, you can get the job done and learn.. 
Also thanks for the latest tutorial... It's helpful ...

"Inside Python is a cleaner language struggling to get out."(\*) C++ quote misapplied. I guess all languages start life with, or acquire, warts. But I wish gradual typing had been built-in from the beginning. 
Someone did mention that I should of posted this in r/learnpython and in hindsight probably would have been more appropriate to put it there as well. You brought it up as if I don't fall into that group but then there was me bringing up that this was my first time using classes in general haha. Thanks for the detail though. It was useful. When I get the chance I'll work on the save function although I will have to change it in some form since when the object is created the exp attribute is defined to be 0 in the init function. Think the easy fix will be to take exp as an input and if there isn't any input, have it default to 0. Last thing: Even though it's just a home project I have been acutely aware of the massive security problem that I've been incorporating to be able to get parts of the objects that I want when I don't know which object I have (which you can imagine is all the time with this kind of project). I'm just going to leave an example code as is. Doesn't need any words. for i in team: print("Level: " + str(eval(str(team[i]) + ".getLevel())) In retrospect I don't know why I haven't even thought of trying team[i].getLevel() (or now just team[i].Level) but code (not even in for loops) in this vain to access the object is over my code. Two executes I think as well. Would team[i].getLevel() even work or some variant. If you couldn't tell, I know how much filth that line of code must be.
so what happens take the test again and you print the list? ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) 
I’d still recommend Pygame because of the later community and the amount of examples.
If your project aligns well with what Django does for you by default, sure. Unless you have a deep understanding of what it provides over and above how python works, Django isn't a very pliable framework and you might struggle to customize it to match a complex project.

&gt; Think the easy fix will be to take exp as an input and if there isn't any input, have it default to 0. Sounds like the best option to me. &gt; for i in team: print("Level: " + str(eval(str(team[i]) + ".getLevel())) &gt; In retrospect I don't know why I haven't even thought of trying team[i].getLevel() (or now just team[i].Level) but code (not even in for loops) in this vain to access the object is over my code. Two executes I think as well. Would team[i].getLevel() even work or some variant. If you couldn't tell, I know how much filth that line of code must be. Good instincts, definitely try to avoid `exec`s and `eval`s where possible. To print the level for everything in the `team` you should be able to do for member in team: print(f"Level: {member.getLevel()}") if `team` is a list. From your usage, though, I suspect it's a dict. I recommend reading about the `dict.values()` and `dict.items()` methods, as they're very useful for looping through a dict's values, and its (key, value) pairs, respectively. for member in team.values(): print(f"Level: {member.getLevel()}") Inserting programmatic values into strings is more generally called string formatting: [here's an article](https://realpython.com/python-f-strings/) about the ways to do it in python. I wouldn't worry about the security aspect too much here - `eval`ing isn't quite as bad as all that so long as no user has the chance to insert their own arbitrary string into it. But avoiding it is a very good habit to have. A very minor point is that python has a style guide which you might benefit from reading - [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) lays out what python code should look like in ways besides what will actually affect how it runs. These are subjective in the most literal sense, but the more consistent everyone's code is, the easier it is to work with everyone else's code; and the best way to be consistent is to comply with the official standards. One of the most basic, but also most valuable, aspects of pep8 is for classes to use `UpperCamel`, variables and functions to use `snake_case`, and constants to use `SCREAMING_SNAKE`. It makes names more informative and easier to remember.

Does using mypy restrict the libraries you can use or change the use of virtualenv, pip, or other dev tools? Or, can you still use just any old pip-installable library?
The numbers are suppose to be in the shape of a pyramid also.
Mypy is just a static type checker that verifies your static type annotations. You can make it as strict or as loose as you want regarding calls off to untyped libraries. I have mine fairly strict, but my project almost exclusively uses the standard library.

You need to be a bit more specific, we're not going to do your homework for you. A recursive function is a function that calls itself. You can think of recursion as a loop. Start the function by checking for your ending condition, and then write expressions which eventually call the function itself. Your global variable should probably be list you can update with your result set, then use a function to populate it with individual rows of results. Write your functions so the condition to check for before calling themselves is your desired end state. Good luck..

Variable declarations aren't implicit, they just don't exist. It's like saying that types declarations are implicit. No, they just aren't there.
What? Everything I've read said that asyncio is a low level API for developers to implement modules like trio or curio on top of. Rereading the docs, it provides both, but the stuff you mention (event loops mostly) are explicitly referred to as low level.
Looks promising there is one major problem, getting the user id with a regex. Using regex for this *can* be okay if you are prototyping, the thing you are trying to get is unique enough and you are well versed with regex but even then, you should try to switch to a better parser such as BeautifulSoup or almost anything that isn't a regex.

Originally, and I mean truly originally, asyncio was introduced as goimg to be higher level async operations rather than that of asyncore and asynchat. Asynchronous functions in and of themselves in many languages are considered a high level concept. But then at some point the design decisions of asyncio forced event loops to be explicit and thus the entire idea of asynchronous functions and even more on top of that is all low level. Trio does not run on top of asyncio at all-- that's how bad it's gotten. An asyncio bridge is provided in a separate library altogether. Curio has a bridge to the asyncio layer but otherwise has no problem running completely without it. That's why asyncio is seen as a bit of a joke in the majority of Python community and people use trio instead.

What part are you having trouble with, and what have you tried?
This doesn't sound right. You should only need async iterators and context managers if the special methods invoked by them are required to be awaitables. For example, it's fine for the "body" of a sync context manager to use await.
It totally depends on the requirements and complexity of your project. Small or not, if the requirement is to squeeze all the performance out of the solution, you're gonna need it. If your server is small-scale, setting up Redis or memcached is a few commands away. You need to spend 2-3 hours to experiment on Celery though. On my experience, once you have successfully setup it should reduce your waiting time for sending email from 1 second to about 20ms. Other tasks could follow such as logging, sms, periodic jobs,

Hello! I'm a bot! I see someone has already suggested going to r/learnpython, a sub geared towards questions and learning more about python. I highly recommend posting your question there. Please follow the subs rules and guidelines when you do post there, it'll help you get better answers faster. Show /r/learnpython the code you have tried and describe where you are stuck. **[Be sure to format your code for reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/faq#wiki_how_do_i_format_code.3F)** and include which version of python and what OS you are using. *** ^(this bot is written and managed by /u/IAmKindOfCreative) ^(This bot is currently under development and experiencing changes to improve its usefulness)
Are you using virtual environments? Which package manager are you using? What is the output of your environment variables PATH and PYTHONPATH (I think there are some IPython-specific environment variables as well but I could be confused on that point). Can you launch an IPython/Jupyter notebook session from the command line?
As to why, it's partially because the pattern of specifying each table with a class and rows in that table as an instance of that class, which looks to be the most common way to specify the schema of a database in existing packages for database access. Part of it is also just to exercise my skills and try to make something that I like. Nothing in particular is wrong with SQL, but I think writing SQL into long strings in your code is generally more error-prone and harder to detect problems with early depending if you are mocking out the database in unit tests or the like. 1,000 is probably more like around 8 that are reasonably mainstream. I think what I'm doing is conceptually different that the loose equivalents I've seen thought I haven't tried all 8. It's probably most similar to SQLAlchemy core, if anyone really uses that on its own.
I used python and selenium to download a bunch of past episodes of coast to coast when I was an insider. Not the whole catalogue or anything, just the past few years tagged aliens. 
May you elaborate on the eve online part? Plying the game myself, and used ESI for some stuff. What do you use your "self built history" for?
He is probably using oh-my-zsh or oh-my-bash respectively for zsh or bash shell. They both have multiple themes for terminals. Also you need to install nerd fonts (patched version of fonts which contains special characters like the heart etc.)

Dig deeper into things like meta programming to sharpen your understanding of the Python object system. 
I scrape stock history data and option chains. But I don't use any web scraper add-on. Just index, regex, and slice. 
If you have MSVS, you probably also have dumpbin So, try: dumpbin /headers path\to\python.exe it will also print information about the CPU architecture this executable was compiled for.
If it were just a matter of configuration files than I would agree. It is more than just configuration files, though. It is nice to be able to install (and start over) various things like Apache modules, pip packages, snap packages and source distributions et cetera. This means that you have ti try things, fail and try again. or try things then have a better idea and try something else. In a case like this, I think that a VM like Virtualbox, VMware, Xen or even BSD jails are excellent tools to help with the sort or organic growth that is bound to arise. Just my two cents, actually. 
Isn't that more like branching out?
You could just take the length of the number (minus 1) and divide by three to get the "type". . . . def determineNumType(): userNumber = data.get() idx = len(userNumber) - 1 // 3 print(largeNUM[idx]) 
This is more a speech recognition related question than python related one IMHO.
Learn a couple of cross platform GUI libraries. I’m assuming not much GUI work is being done on the backend. Tackle a GUI and you can effectively develop apps users want. 
Learn how Python actually works by writing native extensions. Try Cython and Nuitka, but better still, just write couple extensions in C.

I have a few that I run fairly regularly. I scrape an online fashion site whenever there is a sale on. I scrape stock levels so I can wait for further price drops for particular items I want. Whenever I’m traveling or planning to travel I get daily prices for flights and car hire via push notifications (Pushbullet) The most recent was scraping a popular online property site to get alerts when new houses were listed and/or price drops and open viewings (I prefer push notifications rather than the sites built in emails)
Is this a good way to organize torrents?
What's more annoying is how much these posts get upvoted when there is information about very active Discord server in this sidebar and an IRC server in the /r/learnpython sidebar.

If you actually just want to see it running you can just clear the screen rather than printing succssive versions one after the other. Assuming you are running on a linux system (or have one available to run on) just import os at the start and change "tick()" to . . . def tick(): threading.Timer(0.1, tick).start() copied_matrix = copy_matrix(matrix) os.system('clear') for i in range(len(matrix)): row = '' for j in range(len(matrix[0])): if matrix[i][j].is_alive(): row += 'X' else: row += ' ' matrix[i][j].should_populate(copied_matrix) print(row) Not the smoothest or prettiest way--but you can actually see it running. `os.system('clear')` doesn't work on repl.it so you'd need an actual machine or virtual box for the "os" option. On replit you can use `import replit` and change the "os.system" line to `replit.clear()`.
Seems less jangly if you also change the Timer code to 0.08 for both repl.it and in a terminal. YMMV based on system.
No I mean branching out from backend. Doing ML requires very different skill and experience, in my impression.

Scrape, not scrap.
That surely is just a case of formatting your output, maybe look into padding.

Inspiring stuff!! I am in a similar situation as you. Can you pls share some tips of how you got better at programming ? 
What’s the name of that site ? 
Right. Reddit removed the new lines. Each line of code must be on a separate line. 
/r/learnpython
Exactly. It's not like I'm not aware of Python's ML prowess, but it's not like learning a new tech, it's an entirely different discipline.
139000 x 139000 is a ridiculously big matrix. What are you trying to do with it? With float64 (139000**2) is more than 1000GB of data!
That's debatable. In other languages, variable declarations usually contain more information about the variable - like the type, whether it's static, stuff like that. In python, the only thing a variable declaration does is create key/value pair in the corresponding scope's dictionary (globals/locals/__dict__), which means that the only information python has about that variable is its name. So the question is whether creating a name in a dict counts as a variable declaration. I would say it does.
Does anybody know a good source to learn how to download videos/pictures from sites? im familiar with scraping, i did some projects, such as a program that reminds me with a mail when a new movie realises. But i never donwloaded something thorugh using python. i would be happy if someone can post a source to do so.
As I understand it trio provides its own implementation of an asyncio event loop which is designed in a way that makes this possible. The case it solves an async function that calls into sync code that then needs to do something asynchronous. Say you pass a callback function into a library and the callback is async. So trio could walk up the call stack and find some async context to figure out which task needs to be suspended.

If you're interested in OO python, then you should try attrs. Even after the introduction of data classes is still a great tool. &amp;#x200B; Another tool you should always consider is pyscaffold.
Specifically, things such as the transaction history and mining ledger only report like, 10k results, so once that fills up.. you loose history ;( The Eve api is super amazing and I recommend checking out esipy, they have great flask example that I played with and it helped me a lot https://github.com/Kyria/EsiPy

help me write a program Write a Python program that will check the validity of credit card numbers. The program will read sixteen-digit integers (which may have been entered with blanks or dashes every 4 digits), and for anyone will print the word "True" if it is a valid credit card number or "False" otherwise. The program will stop as soon as it reads at the input string "END" or "end". &amp;#x200B; The validation check of each hexadecimal number is done according to the following algorithm: &amp;#x200B; If the first digit is less than 4 or greater than 7, the card is marked invalid. Otherwise, we double (only) the digits that are in the redundant positions of the number (1st, 3rd, 5th, ..., 15th). &amp;#x200B; If these are double digits, we add their digits to make one-digit digits. If after the changes the sum of 16 digits is an integer multiple of 10, the card is valid. Otherwise it is invalid

Packages to look into (will link more later): - pdftk - ghostscript - poppler - pdfminer 
Honestly they should just drop python 2.7 at this point, otherwise they will be stuck supporting it on the pygame 2 versions for ages
BeautifulSoup is a wrapper around parsers, in common case it uses lxml.
Hm, you accept functions and generators, but do not coroutines and functions. That's weird.
I'm not sure who told you Python is bad, but if it were, I doubt Reddit, Instagram, Google and Dropbox would all be using it extensively.
IMO, Python is still pretty powerful and allows you to do a lot of stuff with it. Again, depends on your goal with the language. Maybe Go or Rust, next?
Where did I say Python was bad? I actually said learn more languages 
[Here's](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/9tqxd9/python_is_becoming_the_worlds_most_popular_coding/) a post that inspired me to write this. 
Any specific points on that thread? I mostly see subjective stuff and "show me the jobs".
Is it just me or /r/python is being invaded with quite a lot of beginner posts recently, showcasing their first ever scripts that have no real use for anybody else?
Much appreciated, thanks!
My fault
Lol, thank you
It already exists... 
Pretty uncertain what I'm looking for tbh. Jumped into data science since machine learning has lots of maths behind their models and python is one of the main languages there. A few days ago, I did a test at a company, which looked more like back-end programming and I thoroughly enjoyed myself during the time. Hoping to find a job where I still need maths, need to constantly problem-solve and learn new things. Programming/data science sounds like a hit. Since I can't pinpoint to anything beyond that, it's difficult to decide on the language. Python is okay so far since it can be used for all sorts of tasks. Yet, talking with some companies, I keep hearing that python isn't enough and I'd need to know another language. :) 
I don't follow. What does me wanting to make `await` implicit have to do with generators?
As I mentioned in the beginning, it's likely that I caught on to the general emotion of the thread, i.e. the subjective stuff. The main point would probably be: "There's a good language to solve a problem and it's ***never*** Python". The sentiment kept being repeated throughout the thread. I do think the statement is wrong but can't explain why. Hence checking in this subreddit. 
It looks like there is an xml file in the repository that has all the verb variations. Can you put it to work? I don’t know. Do you mean recreate the website? What was the functionality of the website?
That sounds like a personal opinion more than anything. Lots of people solve their problems successfully with Python.
I read your whole exchange with Zephyr. Just to reassure you: Zephyr is completely wrong and a basement troll. Next time just stop replying; they’re not worth your time :)
I should have stopped the moment I realised he is here to troll. But I guess my frustration with trolls took over my senses. Anyhow, such people deserve to be called out. It only emboldens them if you put up with their tantrums. 
Python is great for data science, because it's quick to develop exploratory code, it has a huge variety of 3rd party libraries for data science (including industry-leading stuff like tensorflow), and it's a great glue language for operating between files, databases, web APIs, web pages, and libraries written in many other languages. If you ever need to personally write anything high-performance, you'd need another language, but it's still probably a better idea to write the library, give it python bindings and then incorporate it into a script that way, than write the whole thing end-to-end in the lower level language. I'm doing this with rust.
Cheers for that! Gonna go back to coding instead of worrying. :) 
Mainly football results
Also that name is incredible. It manages to reference what they're doing, how hard it is, and the language they're doing it for in a single word.

I know you're joking :). But in all seriousness, as a backend dev, I still can read frontend dev code. I still can understand js, Android, RoR. But ML, even in python is pure black magic to me. I don't know what to do with all those conv, relu etc. I read all the difference of yolo, ssd, faster cnn and think okay I understand it. Then I look at the source code and my mind went blank :(

The problem is that people want a silver bullet. Programming languages are tools. Just like you wouldn't use a screwdriver on a nail, you wouldn't use Python on a kernel driver. Just like you wouldn't use a hammer on a screw, you wouldn't use C for heavy text processing, especially if I/O is your bottleneck. 
Haven't got that far myself, but from reading, [not bad at all](https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3).
good point i'd add coverage.py + pytest-cov to the list then
Reasons why not to use Python: 1. If performance is *monumentally important* to your use case. Don't make video games or anything that needs real-time performance, but anything and everything that doesn't require a huge amount of speed (which is most things) its fine. 2. If you're afraid of dynamic typing. ...and that's it. It's easy to learn, easy to write, and easy to read. It has tons and tons of modules for everything you could need. It's gaining more and more popularity in every field - including data science. Plus, no matter what language you try to learn, there are tons of fanboys that will trash it. Pose this question about C++ in a general programming community and you'll be inundated by people complaining about the language and proselytizing Rust. It's the nature of programming.
I wrote a 60000 lines of Python code application. This application spans from custom hardware control, to some real-time 3D graphics, passing through pdf files generation, some sqlite database, some networking. Performance is perfect on a 1-core 1.6Ghz Atom processor. One of my clients is running a 2 million lines of Python code web-based ERP, developed in-house. It works as required, with no not-justifiable waits for the users. I don't know what are the expectactions of who thinks Python is slow and not suited for complex systems.

Dammit! I just spent a good chunk of last Friday trying to get Tabula to work...
As an alternative I've always used this as a book mark: https://theus.github.io/instantgram/
Camelot -&gt; The Round Table. Tables because tables and round because they're a bit hard to parse this way. Python the language is named after Monty Python, which features this beauty: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9wdYy3tCm4
Those are assignments, not declarations.
Doesn't the matrix also need a contiguous allocation of said space? Not familiar with Windows, but I hope your heap implementation can do that.
Well, that's just biased opinions from companies, basically. I hate Java so I would never recommend it. Though it's a good programming language for certain things.
how are you using this? and for which part is VBA responsible?
I wrote a little script that scrapes an event page on HLTV.org (e.g. [ECS Season 6 Europe](https://www.hltv.org/matches?event=4071) and creates an iCalendar file with all of the matches. I then import that into Google Calendar. The latter bit I plan to build into the script itself and let it update existing events with updated info if needed... Some day when it bugs me enough or I'm not lazy.
I'm a bit of a python noob, but this would be incredibly helpful to my work. I successfully installed the package using Anaconda, but now when I got the python prompt and try to import camelot, it immediately crashes Python and takes me back to the conda prompt. Any ideas on how to fix this, or reinstall?
Is it just beautiful or has it another purpose ?
I automated a ticket system for a Tech support project. We had two web platform,Service-now, for ticketing and SAP for user data. I created a Excel that call xlwing and run a selenium script to login and scrap all user data in the SAP database, and based in the Excel input, open the right ticket in service now for the right group with all the important checks. It used to be 10 people just for doing that, now we only need one person, to fill the Excel template and click start. 
Didn't recognize the 2nd table on the pdf for me. It's not clearly a table though. More just like rows. It's too bad because this would help a lot with my workflow.
No, it's just beautiful 
Any luck? My PDFs are damn complicated so I can never get the data right 
It looks like you need to install Ghostscript ("Please make sure Ghostscript is installed and available in the PATH variable.")
I can't recall ever hearing about a language-specific(or maybe even programming in general) certificate meaning very much.
"yikes! .... at least it's formatted" ... then I'd rewrite it hah
And that's my task actually! The downside is, even after working for more than 3 months with this codebase, I have no idea what this code tries to achieve. So, now I need to go ask the original developer or kill a lot of time trying to understand it. I guess it's understandable for big-time Javascript developers, though

Remeber the tagline. Hardly anything you see on XKCD are pure facys. It's mostly just enough facts that the essential contents (Sarcasm, Romance, Math and Language) will stick together. Very few programmers do in fact believe that voting machines are a good idea. The push comes from people who a) want results right now, and b) don't want to pay the cost of that, i.e. politicians.
Python is a tool. It's really great at some things. For other things, other tools would be a better choice.
Local classifieds. No API? No problem. https://classifieds.ksl.com/
I have it actually running now, took me forever to figure out getting the Java SDK installed so it would even run. Still working on cleaning up the tables. Mine are also complicated, and Tabula thinks the line graphs next to the tables are also part of the table. :-(

Also extracting data from a PDF is like pulling a sword from a stone.
Released a new version of \[caramel\]([https://pypi.org/project/caramel/](https://pypi.org/project/caramel/)) in order to improve performance a bit, and enable cleaning out of old certificates. In other news, there's also a kubernetes controller one can run to automatically provision tls certificates inside k8s for those who need it. This code isn't written in Python though, since the k8s bindings are a bit annoying.
At this point, I think the "old timers" folks tend to hate on Python because it makes stuff so easy that it feels like cheating to them at some level xD
I think even Video games use python, for glue code.
Thought it was going to be the chemical composition of LSD for a second.
"Feels like cheating" is the right word here.
The hero we need.
Geckodriver and chromedriver are 1 file binaries, to update them just download them from their respective sites, unzip them and overwrite the old file with the new one. If you are on macOS or Linux you can use a package manager to update them, otherwise is just really replacing the old file with the new one.
Yep. Actually, all the game logic can be implemented in Python with (usually) no issue, it's the graphics and physics etc you don't want to do with Python. As long as the Python is hooking up to the lower level code (which it almost always is) its perfect as an engine's scripting language. And if you're doing something that could use a performance use, there's no reason why not to do that bit in a compiled language. 
Thanks! I'll definitely look into it. I'm also not a data scientist, but coastal engineer. I am a Matlab guy but my current work uses python. And since half of our team consist of Excel fanatics I'm afraid that if I don't learn python I will become one of them. Hope I can shift the balance and our scripts will be mainly done in python soon!
XD
Mmm, I'll look into doing something similar.
Any advice?
&gt; I wouldn't use Python to write a mobile app Just wait for [pybee](https://pybee.org/) to be fully mature!
You would be better off using Cython, IMO
Yes, 1st Jan 2020 support ends. Supporting both python 2 and 3 introduces extra junk in terms of compatibility shims. If you are in any case releasing a version 2 with some breaking changes, might as well take the opportunity to clean up and tell people to use the 1.9 series for py2 support. I see this happening a lot with scientific computing libraries, where a large number of projects are moving to remove python2 compatibility now to avoid the maintenance burden in the future (matplotlib springs to mind, 3.0 is py3 only). The Python3 statement site explains this well [https://python3statement.org/](https://python3statement.org/) .

Thank you. Learning Python now and thought virtual environments was much more complicated than that. Was going to stay away until I 'knew python' but this clicked for me.

Ahh you're right. Sorry I don't use Instagram enough and I thought that the profile picture would be clickable to view it as a standard Instagram picture. 
iz ok ma friend
This is awesome! I’m just starting out with Python but I’d love to be able to do stuff like this
To build use buildozer for example
Just need to combine this with some nlp and an outlook script so whenever someone sends me a snarky email this automatically sends
Also when posting error outputs it's best to indent them with 4 spaces so Reddit treats it as unformatted code.
&gt; Supporting both python 2 and 3 introduces extra junk in terms of compatibility shims. It does, but it's honestly not that hard to do. Unicode is by far the hardest problem in adding Python 3 support. The thing is, once you get it right, your Python 2 code fully supports unicode with the same code base. Beyond that, print works the same (assuming you use `__future__`), proper division is easy to support (even without `__division__`). For things like packages have been moved, the six module handles the rest. &gt; a large number of projects are moving to remove python2 compatibility now to avoid the maintenance burden in the future (matplotlib springs to mind, 3.0 is py3 only) I run an open source project and I feel that's incorrect. I want to drop Python 2 support because I want to take advantage of new features and specifically better mypy support. It's also 30% faster for my code, so why not?

Judging by my bookshelf, I've been using Python for 22 years, and it wasn't even the newest kid on the block back then. What it is, is mature. (aka. boring and un-hip). It's a valuable language to know. Particularly for scripting and data processing. If there's some task you need done quickly, Python's ubiquitousness means you will likely easily find usable snippets with a quick Google. I've had better luck with Python in that regard than any other language. Python has some nasty warts, but so do most (all?) other languages. It shouldn't be your only language (and you're not planning it to be, good on you). Personally I vastly prefer C++ for most desktop apps with a GUI or those needing to communicate with embedded devices and such. Elsewhere, I've had better luck with JVM based languages. YMMV. Also, don't necessarily limit yourself to popular languages. Learning a niche language like e.g. Clojure can be beneficial for looking at programming tasks from different angles.
Astonishingly helpful post. I'm just curious why you insert the burst/recombine steps though? What problem does this solve?
I don't get it. map stops when the shortest iterator is exhausted. And the last iterator passed is an empty list, so it does exactly nothing.
Not to be that guy, but it looks like it's trying to work out who has been working on what projects before the given date(time) and then provide that as a list of the amount of time they reported they worked on it? So it's kinda like a "how many hours do we bill each project for" function
Google "python tutorials" and pick one that is in a format you like, whether text, interactive, or YouTube. 
I started making a virtual pet like tomagachi so I can learn how to use files and time and other things! So far I figured out how to store info in a text file and wrote real nice functions that's allow me to change them and got a basic mock-up of the main screen.
You will soon realize that python with pandas is much better than matlab (which is at the level of numpy) Don't forget to transfer the knowledge. You will have to deal with "Excel and VBA are better because everyone has it on its computer" people. If you are the only one doing python and able to do python that the adoption might be very slow
Is there a difference between google cloud and google drive? When I search for "google cloud storage" I get google drive. 
So... what would have to be different for you to consider them declarations?
This guys are damn heroes
r/loadingicons
The ability to declare a name without assigning it a value. Common examples of this are forward-declarations in C++, or a pattern like int x; x = 4; In javascript as an example, `var x` keeps the value of x as `undefined` instead of null or something, but can be used to change the scope in which a variable is accessible.
It should be doing what you're saying, so yeah, good analysis. Still, the glance value of this thing is just...
Here's a possibly controversial opinion: The language you use is _way_ down the list of things that matter for a project's success, so don't worry about it too much.
OCR performance gets killed if you do all the pages at once so you split it into one smaller image for each page.
You can uninstall it, but you don't need to. I have 3.6 and 3.7 installed myself. Just make sure you are running the correct version when you run your script or use an IDE.

I agree with kramertj02 on this. You can simply open the text file in read mode, read each line from it and use split to break each line. That will return you with a list of all the words separated apart with space or so. You can iterate through list to get your desired values.
Right now, I believe that there are a few valid criticisms that one could make. Incidentally, I think they are exactly the things that the core developers and projects like myPy and PyPy are working to overcome. In my opinion, the worst thing about Python that adds fuel to the anti-Python camp fire is its ease of use. Yes, it's easy to be productive and "good enough" in Python without learning the ins and outs of writing compiled packages or when you should use named tuples. So there's a lot of sub-optimal code and some sloppy practitioners out there (often non-engineers in the scientific or data communities who frankly shouldn't be wasting their brain power on such trivialities). Of course, the REASON for this non-engineer use of Python is precisely because it ISN'T those other languages that the curmudgeons are so in love with. So they can throw their temper tantrums, as far as I'm concerned. I'll be over here living my life.
I couldn't wait to try this after work. After uninstalling the guest utilities it worked! Thanks!
**H O W**
While I have a CS degree, I didn't really need to apply those skills in my first couple jobs (sysadmin and network engineering). I could have easily done them without any idea of what even a for loop is. That being said, I took the time to learn some powershell and bash so I could make reports for myself and management, or to do some \_very\_ basic config management (I had no idea Chef/Ansible/Salt were a thing way back when). After I got tired of doing the mundane stuff, I got an opportunity to do Support Engineering for a startup. My previous skills doing IT/SysAdmin work helped prep me for a lot of the infrastructure stuff I had to do, but that role gave me even more opportunities to hone my scripting and programming skills. Soon enough I was writing tools that other Support Engineers could use to make our (work) lives easier. I guess I impressed my bosses enough that I got a promotion to a 'DevOps' role, where I got to focus on automation even more. &amp;#x200B; The DevOps role also gave me a chance to contribute back to the project too. I've sinced moved on from that job but I'm still doing 'DevOps' stuff where I still get to apply my SysAdmin knowledge with programming. It's definitely a good fit for me. &amp;#x200B; Now, all that being said. How did I learn all this stuff? 1. CS Degree certainly helped out with programming concepts and paradigms. 2. [Derek Banas on Youtube.](https://www.youtube.com/user/derekbanas) His videos are absolutely awesome for learning basics of a programming language. 3. Trying different programming/scripting languages - I learn very well by compare and contrast. 4. Books! 'Effective Python' and 'The Go Programming Language' are musts. Also, an oldie but goodie, 'The Pragmatic Programmer'. 5. Best practice docs, linters and code formatters. The more a linter yells at you for crappy syntax, the better. Sooner than later you'll just write and style your code more 'properly' to avoid all those warnings. I also want to add that I do not spend much time outside of work doing my own programming projects. Dev work is fun, but alas it's \_still\_ work. Programming for fun? Not for me. It's still work. I like my free time to be exactly that, free to do what I want \_other\_ than work. I feel ungluing myself from the computer helps me be a better dev by reconnecting with the rest of the world. 
Just on the off-chance it's relevant; if your matrix is decently sparse, you can use scipy's sparse storage and operations - I'm using it at the moment to store a 10m x 10m pent-diagonal matrix in (iirc) &lt;50MB.
WHY ASYNCIO
Of course it’s not going to be the magic bullet that does everything, but those tools are still pretty good for the appropriate tasks. Python and the vast tool set that comes with it is still worthwhile. Also, sticking to even a few standard conventions prevents unmanageable spaghetti code.

Even more. It slows you down with event loop overhead.
To take a different tact than i've seen anywhere else in this thread: Stop identifying with the language you use. It's a tool. If you are accomplishing what you want with it, then its fine.

I wrote a little Instagram meme bot, it scrapes memes from certain Reddit’s then saves them. I have to manually go through them to make sure there’s no ads or inappropriate memes that will get me banned on insta. There’s probably a way to use some kind of face detection and or text detection to filter out certain faces(hitler mostly cause insta flips over it) and some words
“Always code as if the guy who ends up maintaining your code will be a violent psychopath who knows where you live” - Martin Golding
First thoughts were “extract methods” and “unit test”. It doesn’t seem too hard to grok though, so consider yourself lucky!
I personally enjoy cleaning up old code, so i couldn't help myself ```python def merge_data(acc, item): if not acc: return item reportedTime = acc.get('repotedTime') + item.get('reportedTime') merged_dict = acc.copy().update({ 'reportedTime': reportedTime }) return merged_dict def map_method(items, i): return reduce(merge_data, items) def group_by_method(item): # personal preference return "{project}:{employee}".format(item) api_search_where_dict = { 'date': { '&lt;=': date_range[1].isoformat(), }, 'status': [ WorkLog.STATUS_CHANGED, WorkLog.STATUS_NEW ] } values = groupby( self._hydra.api_search( WorkLog.HYDRA_RESOURCE_NAME, where=json.dumps(api_search_where_dict) ), group_by_method ).itervalues() for worklog_row in map(map_method, values, []): pass ```
&gt; A python @property decorator lets a method to be accessed as an attribute instead of as a method with a '()'. Today, you will gain an understanding of why is it really needed, in what situations you can use it and how to actually use it. This is part of what the decorator does. Anyone skimming the description would be mis-educated by this. Totally irrelevant ads at the bottom of the article.

You can use the python launcher, py.exe, to easily start the required installed Python version. See https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#from-the-command-line

I usually use Flask-Migrate but the process seems very similar. When I'm throwing something together quickly I run migrations locally and specify the remote db. For my services running in production I generate the migration scripts and commit them to git. I have codebuild hooked to the repo to run a build that runs my tests, run the database migrations and runs zappa deploy.
I’m actually kinda intrigued. Are you working on a Hydra API? I’m working on one too and I’m curious how widely spread linked data APIs are.

Nice. Thanks for sharing. This confirms to me that virtualbox uses a simple video driver for the guest vm. It makes sense, since this driver just has to support flexible resolutions and low memory usage.

Thanks a lot!! I don't have a cs degree and that's what i feel is the missing link. I have started doing basic python scripting for a lot of tasks at work but really need to start applying oop concepts to build tools that scale! Going to check out your book references and the YouTube link. Also wondering if I should go for an online course for devops where i can learn more sophisticated programming skills. I do have an electrical engineering degree but we rarely focused on coding.
Ah yeah I didn’t noticed that. I never really tested to code, I just refactored it and I don’t want to make any mock data.

Your question has already been answered, but I just want to add that if you install both (or more) versions you can add a shebang to your scripts to indicate which interpreter you want to execute it. And you'll be able to double click to execute your scripts. For windows the shebangs are as follows: `#!python3.6` or `#!python3.7`

Thank you! 
Amazing! I can't wait to try this out!
what were you trying to say
Personally, I use PyCharm ([https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)) which colours parts of the code depending on what they do, tells me if I made a mistake and allows me to run it. If you just want something simple, use IDLE ([https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/))
I just wanted to make sure OP spotted it in case they used your refactoring.
It would definitely be cx_Oracle for me. I felt like I was spinning my wheels with python for a long time, just making one off little programs that would take input from me and give me some sort of output. I was also talking a night class about SQL that used an Oracle database as the engine of choice. When I realized how to write SQL in my python programs to save and retrieve data, it was off to the races for me. I could make address book command line like apps that were useful, I could store inventory items for little text based adventure games. Of course the next natural progression of this was to learn web programming with python. Haven't stopped coding since.
No gp is correct: map with multiple iterables effectively zips them and feeds the result tuples as arguments to the function. It does stop at the end of the shortest just like zip, so all of OPs code is a fancy noop.
More comments please. I'd like to use this for something since I enjoy learning vocabulary and haven't used Python in a while.
This is savage. I also recognize this guy from some other tutorials involving OpenCV that were very helpful. Definitely worth looking into.
can you share the code for it?
It's unusual, and I (generally) avoid it, but other than saying "it's weird" or "it's bad style", I can't give you an explanation; it'll _probably_ work fine. I'd avoid it simply because I'm very conservative when I write Real Code® -- I don't want the person reading it to be surprised.
Yes, it can be done. No, it is not considered good or common practice; comment heavily. What it accomplishes is it delays the import until the method is actually invoked.
I think I found the issue. It’s a python script I’ve been working on using turtle graphics. Why does it cause python.exe to run endlessly when the script hasn’t even been ran? 
I mean i have done it but theres not really a need to ever have to do it. 
Yes in case of circular imports. Python will just import on first utilization, ignoring it on other invocations. I don't see any problem other than code organization.
From turtle import * is what is causing issues but I have no idea why. It runs python.exe endlessly until it crashes my computer. 
wow cool I was just searching for something like this a couple of months back with no luck
I just went ahead and installed a new Anaconda 64........same issue.
requests + bs4, sometimes regexp, IMHO. 
I’ve recently become a fan of requests_html over beautifulsoup, but both are great
huh ? need JDK ? wtf 
Trying to put Flask in production
Had a course instructor show an example of it within a try/except statement once just for use in backwards compatibility with Python 2.7 It’s has niche uses but isn’t to be used heavily. 
Eclipse with PyDev
zope and then years later ... turbogears
You can use scrapy
I've never used virtualenv, and it already doesn't seem to matter how many versions are installed.
I have used beautiful soup, but I later decided I favor pyquery since it uses an api familiar to frontend web developers. Actually, when I learned pyquery I wasn't yet doing any frontend web, but it helped me learn selectors shortly before I went from backend to frontend for a while.
It's very uncommon, but it has its use cases. For example, I did this the other day for a function that is only invoked if the user uses a specific argument that indicates they want results sent to them via an email. I anticipate that roughly 95% of the times this program is run, an email is not necessary. Why import the module if you don't anticipate on using it most of the time? Putting the import statement within the function only saves resources in the long run. However, again, this is a fairly niche use case. I would say the overwhelming number of times that I import a module, I do so through normal means. Think of it as a "tool in the toolbox", and not a rule or guideline to program by.
Id start by thinking of a problem you want to solve or the reason you want to do it at all, and just research/google how to do it.
&gt; Is this normal? No &gt; acceptable? bad practice? Yes, unless you have a specific reason 
Can you please give an example of the Government data? I am super interested in this. Started learning python and am looking into starting with a small project. 
Don't worry about things like that too much. I use C#, TypeScript, Go, SQL, JavaScript, and Python in roughly that order because they are the languages I know and I happen to have a job that is a Microsoft stack and hobby around the most in Go right now. But if I'm teaching in the Meetup I host and someone asks a question, I'm most likely to live code an answer in Python. Why? There are a lot of different backgrounds present and Python is readable even if you don't know it. Also, you can add a ton of functionality in a couple lines of code. There are better and worse languages for all types of things. Often it doesn't matter, and often preference, where you happen to work, and random chance combine to make a best choice in a particular instance. HOWEVER! In data science, you will find that Python really is the best. If it's too slow for something, it can glue together the very fastest alternatives (Cython or even C and C++) quite comfortably. As a data scientist you might find that your toolset will grow, but you'll probably use your tools in an order like Python, SQL, R, C, or something like that. Personally I hope that Go becomes a Data Science powerhouse, but Python is a Goliath in this arena. Some of the calculations you run will only run once or a few times and then you'll use the dataset they produced. That means a lot of the complaints about type safety and reliability are nullified. You'll reuse some logic, but you're focused on discrete answers with well understood inputs. If you decide to go into web, there are fantastic pros and cons to consider for different languages, but you'll probably have a blast using Python and learning Django, Flask, or Falcon. If you wind up getting hired by someone who wants to pay you to learn a totally different language, you haven't wasted time with Python. It's going to be the fast tool for a lot of test parsing, number crunching, or a quick api for you to use in a utility here and there even if it isn't part of your official job. Python will probably be helpful for most of our lifespans, and each additional language you learn helps you love and understand the others even further.
I bet I know the one! There are so many podcasts that only let you download just the latest episode via your app, but all are available from the website. Did the same kind of thing as you - figured out the pattern, but then also used a library to generate and host an RSS feed and pointed my Podcast app at it to let me download all the past episodes. ThatAmericanLife.mydomain.com worked like a champ. Can’t remember which rss library - maybe rfeed?
Can someone help me appreciate this more? Is this hard to write? Could you write a shader for a 3D game and render e.g. Rocket League in ASCII?
Not really a library, but holy shit do I love Django. It taught me so much about the inner workings of Python. I just love the overall design. The hardest part when I got started was knowing where to start when working on a project. Django helped me realize the best place to start is almost always with the data models. 
i guess u used api for it . but i can't see api token in it. and code is still working . how did u hide that.?
