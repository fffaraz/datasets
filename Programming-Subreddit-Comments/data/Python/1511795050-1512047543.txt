I bought the Pack book on Python Machine Learning with Scikit Learn and Tensorflow: second edition. It's been a pretty good introduction so far though it is fairly large. It starts off simple and tries to break down the math and formulae for you.
python.org has loads of resources you should probably start here https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/NonProgrammers
That's a really good resource indeed. Not really anything for learning to understand the math as much as cheat sheets for when you already have a good grasp, but there's a lot of good stuff there, bookmarked, thanks!
Why do we need 20 different asyncio-based Flask replacements?
Can u tell how did u manage to create the reddit bot.. which modules u have used?
How is asyncio helping improve performance when it looks like the routes being compared are pretty synchronous operations (route called -&gt; get connection to db -&gt; send query to db -&gt; get and return results). I don't really see any async operations being performed so I'm confused as to where these performance gains are coming from. If multiple independent and asynchronous operations were being performed then it would certainly be understandable, but that doesn't seem to be the case here.
Which one(s) do you recommend?
Reading the request from client, querying DB, receiving results from DB, sending reply to client are all operations that benefit from async. When you have many connections hitting the server simultaneously then these would all be independent and can be done more efficiently async. 
I don't really care as long as the community and their supporting modules don't fragment into a million parallel peices Nice thing about Flask is that there are a lot of addons and packages for common functionality and these asyncio+Flask speedfreaks threaten to rip that up.
So it sounds like this is only to save on resources and not to actually make requests faster. If there are 8 UWSGI or gunicorn workers processing requests and you get 8 requests at the same time then both Flask and Quart should be handling them in the same amount of time. If they both got 16 requests then Flask wouldn't be able to start the next 8 requests until any of the first 8 were complete, but Quart starts processing the next request once it has queued up an async task. Is that the gist of how it's getting performance gains?
How can i get one of these?
Sanic quotes being 6 times faster than Flask, so we can speculate this is 2x slower than Sanic
Yes, that's correct. Also, if you need to do multiple independent DB operations say (or get data from an API or whatever), then they can occur concurrently without one request having to wait for the other to complete. It isn't simple 8 requests to 16, it would be able to handle hundreds more because typical web servers are almost completely IO blocking, and hence median response time &amp; requests/sec under load reduces quite a bit.

thanks. ill look at that
Neural Networks are just bins or numbers called weights and the bin is called a node. A simple example has 4 input nodes, 4 hidden nodes and 4 output nodes. I make the forward weights 1.of the input layer then each input adds it weight to the hidden layer. Now the forward weights of the hidden layer are 4,4,4,4. I do the same from the hidden to the output now the output layer forward weights are 16,16,16,16. Now we do the same thing in reverse with different weights we'll call reverse weights. Doing this until we get to the input layer we find the reverse weights to be ((16*4)*4), ((16*4)*4) ,((16*4)*4), ((16*4)*4). Now I know that I need to set the input layers forward weights to some negative number in order for the output layer forward weights to be 1,1,1,1. Now just adding makes everything go whackaddotle so functions called activation functions are used. Here are some python examples of activation functions. def Sinc(x): """(x) / x""" if x == 0.: return 1. return math.sin(x)/x def Gaussian(x): """something""" return cmath.e** - (x**2) def SoftExponential(a, x): """something""" if a &lt; 0.: return -((math.log(1.-a*(x + a)))/a) elif a == 0: return x elif a &gt; 0.: return ((cmath.e**(x*a) - 1)/a) + a def Bentidentity(x): """something""" return ((math.sqrt(x**2 + 1.) - 1.)/2.) + x def SoftPlus(x2): """something""" return math.log(1. + cmath.e**x2) def ExponentialLinearUnit(a, x): """something""" if x &lt; 0.: return a*(cmath.e**x - 1.) return x def ParametericRectifiedLinearUnit(a, x): """something""" if x &lt; 0.: return a * x return x def Rectifier(x): """something""" if x &lt; 0.: return 0. return x def Softsign(x): """something""" return x / (1. + abs(x)) def TanH(x): """something""" return (2. / (1. + cmath.e**-(2*x))) - 1. def Softstep(x): """something""" return 1. / (1. + cmath.e**-x)
There is an option! WOW... Should be ticked by default then?
ive looked at python.org for a bit and i dont mind the mini games that they have. but im too new to programming to really play them. ill look at other links they have and the wiki page that you linked, thanks
Agree completely. I’m at the point where I could benefit from async, but it’s not clear to me which libraries/plugins are likely to stick around (support &gt; raw performance). 
/r/theydidthemath 
As usual: - no, it can't replace flask. They don't have a 10th of the tooling and ecosystem. - why do you need those perfs in the first place ? Most website bottlenecks will no be in your python code.
It is actually not as high as 2x in this type of production app as the http parsing (which is most of the difference) is not such a large part. (I'll try to do and then write something concrete to back up this statement.)
&gt; You seem to say that the meaning of `+` depends on the context while the meaning of `plus` does not. No, that is not what I am saying. I was saying that similar to how the `namespace` of a function is reserved for one particular thing, the operator `+` should also be able to do just that particular thing i.e., operators and functions should abide by the same rules. But I do understand that in OOP, function overloading and operator overloading are natural. I am not against this per se. Like I said, the benefits in not having them in a language like `python` are minimal.
I agree, we don't. Quart started as an attempt to fork Flask adding asyncio. Sadly I couldn't make that work so instead I kept the Flask-API and built the asyncio parts to make Quart. So I hope that Quart and Flask keep the same API and with some (a lot probably) thought they can merge back into one. The key for me is that Quart and Flask are API compatible up to the async bits.
https://www.adafruit.com/product/2821
&gt; no, it can't replace flask. They don't have a 10th of the tooling and ecosystem. So Quart is [compatible](https://pgjones.gitlab.io/quart/flask_extensions.html) with many of the Flask extensions, and ideally I will figure out how to make it compatible with them all. &gt; why do you need those perfs in the first place ? Most website bottlenecks will no be in your python code. I wanted to show that you can use asyncio libraries with existing Flask code by evolving to Quart and that doing so will make your apps quicker. Whether this matters or not I agree depends on the actual code, and this example is a simplified version of production code I've used.
Data scraping the MLS is illegal last I checked.

Ok so I did that and I got the error message python: can't open file '3.6': [Errno 2] No such file or directory any other suggestions?
I may do up a github page with full instructions and images and code. The ESP8266 with OLED is only about $6 on Aliexpress
I don't think so.
Don't have a poace between `python` and `3.6`, should be one "word"
When I read the title about creating NN from scratch, I thought they are going to implement the network and some of the base functionality (e.g linear regression) from scratch. However, the tutorial uses a machine learning library, which means they are using an existing library to create NN. If you use numpy, matplotlib etc as helper tools for faster development, I would still call it from scratch. However, if you are using an existing library, it would make sense to say "Building NN using SciKit-Learn." The title is definitely click-baity. 
Sanic has gotten good reviews 
There's a course at Udacity too that he did https://www.udacity.com/course/design-of-computer-programs--cs212
While most bottlenecks are indeed not going to happen in Python code, Python code is what limits the number of clients you can handle concurrently. Ideally you are only limited by your database throughput.
Can you elaborate more on how you'd use NewType? Currently I'm defining types (purely for cosmetic/brevity reasons) using: ndt = NewType('ndt', datetime.datetime) dt = NewType('dt', datetime.datetime) def dt_to_ndt(dt: dt) -&gt; ndt: pass FYI using variable names colliding with NewType names doesn't seem to cause any issues.
I would suggest cs101 by udacity. To be honest, it is python 2, but that isn't the end of the world, i used that course, and now program in python 3. It is a free course, which is handy.
I would argue that most of the bottleneck _is_ in your python code, specifically _your_ code, not the wsgi framework code. It's been a while since I've done benchmarking but usually a hello world flask app performs really well no matter what, but any kind of business logic is what starts slowing stuff down. 
What amount of effort needed to make libs like https://github.com/zalando/connexion compatible with Quart?
Don't you love open source?
But in reality, you don't have 8 requests at the same time, you have 8 million requests at the same time. And you can't run 8 million worker processes/threads at the same time. So asyncio helps because it allows the program to work on other requests while some requests are waiting for their stuff to happen.
Couldnt flask just implement an async socket handler and then push the work to a process pool? This is what I'm doing with an async server I wrote, and it hits ~1500 connections a second on my work desktop.
Does the provided code also do the position updates as well?
How would you test a Flask REST API endpoint? The process is the same.
Start with the tutorial in the docs.
I made a thing: [netgraph](https://github.com/paulbrodersen/netgraph). This is a small python library built on matplotlib to make publication quality plots of weighted, directed graphs/networks of medium size (10-100 nodes). The node positions can be [tweaked using the mouse] (https://media.giphy.com/media/xUOxfk8zazlkWLYtlC/giphy.gif), so if you don't like the automatically generated layout, you can change it pretty easily. It accepts a variety of different network formats, such as an edge list, an adjacency matrix, or an igraph.Graph or a networkx.Graph object. For example: import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt; plt.ion() import netgraph # Construct sparse, directed, and weighted graph with positive and negative edges: total_nodes = 20 connection_probability = 0.2 weights = np.random.randn(total_nodes, total_nodes) is_connected = np.random.rand(total_nodes, total_nodes) &lt;= connection_probability graph = np.zeros((total_nodes, total_nodes)) graph[is_connected] = weights[is_connected] # plot netgraph.draw(graph) If you want to try it out the module yourself, you can download the source from [github](https://github.com/paulbrodersen/netgraph) or install it via pip: pip install netgraph 
Do you mean something similar to what's described here? https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41718376/how-to-unit-test-a-flask-restful-api
As someone who was a working programmer in 1991, no, C was not considered high level. It was considered "systems level", ie, suitable for close to the metal programming. Fortran, Pascal, Cobol, and Ada would be 1991 era examples of high level languages.
same problem unfortunately :/ 
Can you reduce your code to the smallest amount of code that shows what the problem is?
I’ll upload all files on github next monday. 
I think a fair bit yet. The problem I have is with extensions that extend (or use) the Flask class, as these typically add and call synchronous methods rather than the asynchronous Quart methods. This is the standard asyncio difficultly of running coroutines from synchronous functions inside of an event loop. (I have an idea whilst writing this that I could try to use the __init_subclass__ method to change things to coroutines - I'll have to try it).
How is it compatible with Flask-SQLAlchemy? I thought async in general was not compatible with SQLAlchemy? Is it that the extension uses calls that you have the same API so it is in the works category? 
I have a basic test app that works with SQLAlchemy, so it works in the technical sense. As you point out it will block the event loop as SQLAlchemy uses blocking IO calls and hence negate many of the asyncio advantages. However I think this is still useful as it allows a two step upgrade process, first to Quart and then a async variety DB connection (I think SQLAlchemy has some asyncio varieties as well now).
https://xkcd.com/927/
I'm a simple man. I see an xkcd reference and I Jupiter.
I like the idea of async'ing my data to the client. While there is a method to do it with flask and sqla. I believe async will be a better solution. But if I will spend time migrate is questionable. I'm using celery for async calls. It does not solve the response problem(stream data/result from db). But it does solve the problem of distributing work between python workers and keeping track of task getting done. async will probably support better arguments. and be (alot?)faster then celery. But my plan is once python gets to slow. I will migrate the slow parts to erlang. Seeing I already have it for rabbitmq. And configuring nginx to change routes from flask to my erl processes should not be to hard. We will see. But goodluck with this project and keep us updated.

Hi! I'm have 5 years of experience in Python. I have played around with web scraping and Flask. My current project is SvejkAnalytics, which analyzes Twitter, Reddit and Google News and gives back a percentage of how positively people talk about a given keyword.

It's fairly simply, I've only been doing Python for a few weeks and I managed to do it. With Python you get modules other people have done to do all the heavy lifting for you. I had learned enough Python for a work project a few months ago and I was able to quickly pick up where I left off and learn enough to do this.
Neat. 
But how do you put python on the ESP8266 and make it work to connect to your network?
I will, thank you for sharing ;)

I thought that his machine learning course was the introduttion level course.
+1 vote for Sanic. I use it for hobby projects and at work. It's steadily getting some good plugins/extensions similar to the ones flask has.
remember to bookmark this reddit thread for additional information and tips
sounds like you got interface diease. I had it when I first went to college. I could build a maze generator. But when it came time for actually displaying the maze, I was like, wtf, no one taught me this. The simplest way to consider what you're doing is perhaps make it a Command Line Interface using [Click](http://click.pocoo.org/5/) Next up, look into something like aiohttp client. The client connects to the service, gets the SMS, does it's magic, then returns the data. This will make more sense if you turn your program into a simple input-&gt;output device.
&gt; Are there any shortcuts to understanding the 'syntax' of stuff like this? For just that notation, you just need to read an A-level (pre-University) maths textbook. Skimming through some (simple) Uni lecture notes would probably help cover you for more complex (heh) notation: e.g. [Vectors and Matrices](http://damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/sjc1/teaching/VandM/notes.pdf). 
You're ignoring the obviously superior R webserver package: RShiny. Forget the Flask, Quart, Chef, and Sanic... Forget what you've learned so far then learn Rshiny.
Its a miracle cause I already started watching your YT videos this week. But don't worry I will probably recommend your staff to many people.
I agree, not just might, it will. If you have anything resembling an actual user base, you need to target distros, not interpreter versions. 
&gt; This means that existing Flask apps can evolve with very little effort into Quart apps Not if these app heavily rely on Flasks thread model. Like mine.
Unfortunately doesn't work on Windows.
Arguably*, you can in Lisp, too. *Arguably because Lisps don't distinguish between operators and functions. 
It's a great book and the one I enjoyed most in my python journey. Robocop is pretty awesome too. 
One of my first releases to PyPi: A client for querying the food truck locations and bookings in Seattle. I also bundled in a small CLI utility. You first have to get the unique ID of the location you wish to query. $ sft locations Then use that ID to determine what food trucks are booked for either today or tomorrow: $ sft trucks_today --location-uid 69 Thanks for checking it out. Pull requests and users welcome :D 
Someone ALWAYS has to invoke the "bottleneck must be IO" myth. Maybe it was true a long time ago when servers were synchronous or threaded and were sleeping on IO most of the time while clients waited in line for their responses. Nowadays the IO wait time is filled with concurrent requests being handled, and the CPU-bound time the framework takes to parse HTTP requests and generate responses is much more relevant to the amount of concurrent requests a server can handle than IO wait.
Can you give more details on what you mean by this? 
It doesn't hurt! It is probably most helpful for you. The process of reflecting on what you have learned and trying to explain it to others externalizes your knowledge and forces you to think things through in a new way. I do have some additional advice for you about your code. You are relying on the items in `mod_dict` being in the order in which they were initialized. This is the behavior in Python 3.6, but older versions of Python make no guarantee that ordering will be preserved. Even in Python 3.6 this is considered an implementation detail rather than an official feature, so the behavior could change in future versions of Python. Here is a cleaner version of your function which sorts the keys so you never end up printing `BuzzFizz` no matter what version of Python you are using: def check_remainder(number): out = '' for key in sorted(mod_dict.keys()): if number % key == 0: out += mod_dict[key] if out == '': return number else: return out Another good habit to work on is good function names. If someone saw that there was a function called `check_remainder()`, they might expect that it would return `True` or `False` based on a remainder. Instead, it is returning the thing that you want to print for the given number. It is also good practice to return a consistent type whenever you can, even though Python does not require it. Given the above, your function might become this: def string_to_print(number): to_print = '' for key in sorted(mod_dict.keys()): if number % key == 0: to_print += mod_dict[key] if to_print == '': to_print = str(number) return to_print Lastly, it is good practice to put the "control" portion of your code into a function as well. Many programming languages require that this portion of the code be put in a function named `main()`. While Python does not require this, doing so makes your code more readable because it will be very clear where the control flow starts. Another reason to put the code in a function is so that you can use the file both as a runnable module and as a module whose functions can be imported by another module. If you run this file, the special variable `__name__` will be `'__main__'`. If another Python file is importing this module, `__name__` will be the name of this module. You only want the control portion of your code to run if you are running this module, not if your module is being imported. So you could do this: def main(): for i in range(1, 101): print(string_to_print(i)) if __name__ == '__main__': main()
In asyncio everything runs in a single thread. In Flask each request has its own thread.
I presume you don't use eventlet or gevent then? Could you also say why you are dependent on this?
This explains it far better than I could... https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/esp8266/esp8266/tutorial/intro.html If you get stuck I can probably help.
That's a feature.
I really like Learn Python The Hard Way for learning the syntax and some basic object oriented programming principles.
If quart is API compatible, wouldn't it mean the addons would just work?
Good stuff friend, I like how you think. Flask isn't my bag (I prefer Django generally) but I'll be sure to check it out. Cheers!

A function calling itself is called recursion. Using recursion to make a loop is prone to bugs and leaks memory. So the loop is the way to go. But it's kind of messy so really the best way is to use both: #Function that obtains user input and checks if it's valid function_user_input = None def function_check_user_input(): function_user_input = input("Function - Please enter ") if function_user_input == "1": return ("You pressed one") elif function_user_input == "2": return ("You pressed two") elif function_user_input == "3": return ("You pressed three") elif function_user_input == "4": return ("You pressed four") #Variable that holds the user's input for the loop example user_input = None while not user_input: user_input = function_check_user_input() print(user_input) --- If you have more questions like this it's better to post them on /r/learnpython. Be sure to [format your code for reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/faq#wiki_how_do_i_format_code.3F) or use a site like pastebin.

Thanks Al!
Well, you are limited by the size of your process pool. I'm assuming stuff like DB calls will happen within in the process in the pool? If so, they would block the process until the operation completed and the pool will get full and block further requests. 
Thanks AI 
Im not a programmer, instead an electrical engineer, but if you were just hired brand new, a company can not expect you to be “profitable” from the get go. It is their job to train you and prepare you for real work in the future. No real learning curve is linear, so you may find it tough now, but you might hit your stride in just a few weeks! I would add, it is better to bite the bullet and ask your or superiors if you don’t know something than to fail at something and have to explain why you aren’t living up to your duty.
Thank you!
Thank you! I just enrolled.
Yea! 
When do you decide if you're ready to classify yourself as an intermediate level programmer? When you can brainstorm a project and think of all the mechanics of how you want it to work?
Who serves high throughput web content from windows?
In my experience, there’s pretty widespread disagreement about what it means to be junior, intermediate, and senior levels. Employers have differing standards both in terms of skills and education. So don’t put too much stock in your title and how that correlates to professional growth. Even if quitting were an option, I wouldn’t recommend it. It sounds like you have a good manager and plenty of challenging work ahead of you. Don’t take that for granted. Finding the right team is half the battle. Interesting work that challenges you is the other half. You are still very, very early in your career. The best way to learn is to roll up your sleeves and dive in. Poor documentation sounds to me like an opportunity to step through the code and understand what it’s really doing. Junior developers search Google for an error message hoping to find an answer that sticks. Senior developers understand fundamentally what the code is doing and what the root cause of the error is. By digging into the code you will start to develop the intuitions of a senior developer. This is not an easy road and it will take you many years and many different projects to get there. Poor frameworks are an opportunity to experiment with improvements. You should learn the trade-offs of design choices, how to better optimize your code for performance, and to make it readable, testable, and the deployments repeatable. This is the difference between programming and engineering. Programmers write code; software engineers build systems. Learning to work through disagreements with your manager is important. When you develop expertise you need to be able to articulate and defend your position. Soft skills are often overlooked by technical people, but they are critical to master if you want to become a technical leader in your company. Lastly, I’ve seen many “senior” developers with 10 years of experience that turned out to have 1 year or experience 10 times. You should never feel too comfortable about the work you’re doing because it means you’re not growing. Instead you want to build the confidence to tackle any problem thrown at you, even problems outside of your comfort zone.

Ahh cool! I’m re learning and took the advice of a friend to find a project I’m passionate about getting done since I’ll want to see it get finished I’ll actually work on it. Anyways: Discord bot for my server that can: 1. Pull tweet updates from twitters and post links. In the background and on a command to pull the latest. 2. Hash file uploads and spit the hash back into chat on Command 3. Upload file uploads to Virus Total or Sandbox Analysis and provide a link to the results in the chat. 4. Run whois queries on command on specific IPs and domains. Also am going to redo the bot in a different language and then watch it via debuggers to see the difference in efficiency/learn another language/ feel the difference in writing. 
:D
Bought your book a year ago, loved it! The video course looks great. Cheers Al!
By "they" do you mean the database? But in what way would this be bad? If the database is blocking, a single threaded server would be waiting on the block and not accepting any new connections or queueing up future requests.
Thank you! I just got the book recently too!
When you use an async call (eg: using asyncpg instead of pyscopg2 for postgres) then the single threaded server doesn't block. It will make the call and then returns to process other connections. When the call completes then the single thread returns to continue execution from where it left off previously. This way the server is able to handle hundreds of requests concurrently in a single thread.
I took this course a couple of years ago and cannot recommend it enough. Al is a great teacher and the coursework provides students with a sense of pride and accomplishment. I'm now using Python confidently on the regular for all sorts of different projects thanks to Al's course. 
Read the docs for this framework. If you don't understand a word or concept, look into it. Other than that, quit worrying; you're doing fine. Most Junior devs aren't given new features to write within the first few weeks of their job. If they did, that would be stupid. Your boss is introducing you to the different parts of an already-existing application so that you can eventually take advantage of code resuse and get a good understanding of your coding practices. Just do what your boss says, ask a lot of questions when you're confused, and keep at it. Progress on big projects can take a lot of time, especially when you're not super familiar with the entire code base. If you feel like you're going way too slowly and feeling like your boss might be getting mad at you for it, ask your boss directly if he or she feels that you're going too slow. Chances are you're just psyching yourself out because you have no frame of reference for this type of work yet. Also Google "imposter syndrome," because you seem like you may be suffering from it.
:D
Thanks for the recommendation!
&gt; Robocop is pretty awesome too. Al's secret shame: It wasn't until just a few years ago that I realized the movie is "RoboCop" and not "Robocop". It's my personal Berenstain's Bear/Mandela Effect.
Awesome! I'm going to try to get back into making videos for YouTube again in the new year.

Ty. i signed up, will be my first Python class
Yes but isnt it handling the postgres connections in the same thread as the sockets? The way I have my server setup is to only accept connections and read their data. That data is then passed to a process pool where it's parsed or handled. AFAIK this means the main thread is only handling socket connections and none of the "work". 
Here is the github https://github.com/getsentry/milksnake and the original blog post https://blog.sentry.io/2017/11/14/evolving-our-rust-with-milksnake
Running Arch I have 3.6.3. But even then I would not hesitate to manage my own runtime for a big application. Getting trapped into what an OS is doing sucks. Like all those running CentOS. I know a few big tech companies that have their own builds of gcc/glibc/python because the OS moves too slow. They still have what ships with the OS but that is relegated to the needs of the OS and not used for building/running custom applications. Custom Installs are pretty easy to manage for python 
Thanks! Been reading your book online jumping through chapters to chapters, and it's great! 
A large codebase, high number of dependencies, and potentially hurting those in our open source community. Also, time and money. https://github.com/edx/edx-platform
Well, what you are doing is basically what a traditional server does. Here is the issue. Lets say your process pool contains three processes. You get a request, its passed on to a process from the pool, and that process makes a DB request and blocks for a while. Another request comes in and it is passes on to another process in the pool, which also blocks. The third request comes in and that is passed to the only remaining free process in the pool, and that process also blocks. Now when the fourth process comes in, the main thread looks at the pool and there are no free processes available since all three of them are currently blocked. So now the main thread blocks until one of these three processes gets free, at which time it can hand off the fourth request to the pool and resume handling new connections. So whenever the pool gets full, the main thread will also block. 
3.x does not bring any real benefits for me. If 3.x is faster and consumes less RAM than 2.x I'll upgrade in no time.
Not with uvloop and ujson. There is an issue that explains how to install the Sanic to Windows if you want to try, https://github.com/channelcat/sanic/issues/855 Basically you need to clone the sanic and then to install it with set SANIC_NO_UVLOOP=true set SANIC_NO_UJSON=true pip install as explained at the end of the issue. Only issue that I had is that I didn't manage to get autoreload working.
yes. it will not share by multiple processes. so, it's multi-processes safe, but it's not thread-safe, because it's a dict. ``` In [1]: import sys In [2]: type(sys.modules) Out[2]: dict ```
Unfortunately Windows deployment is one of my requirements at work.
Got your course while I first landed a job at a tech start up doing basic computer repairs/help desk about a year ago. Was very interested in programming before that, but couldn't code my way out of a wet paper bag. Pyautogui made automating repetitive gui tasks become infinitely easier. The book and course have helped me move from IT grunt to an actual engineering position. Bravo.
If you are an experienced developer in general then it should be obvious to you, that one should prefer one of the established libraries around argument parsing. On top of that they support *well* established cli interfaces - why invent something new people have to adopt to? But if you simply just want to try something on your own, than just have a look at the sources of those libs! Have you ever had a look at click? 
This is like a perfect example of how not to name variables.
I just enrolled. Thanks so much AI Sweigart.
You could use flask for example, and display/edit your data in a browser. No php required.
Besides everything else: iterating over a collection and generate an index like ``for i in range(len(collection))`` is always an *anti pattern*! In python you can iterate over the entries of a collection directly. And if you really need the index, use the special function ``enumerate`` for this special cases. I hope that will help you 😉
As far as your boss hating python, it's no big deal. Some people don't like change when they're comfortable with what they've been doing. Like, if you get used to the types in C# keeping you in line, switching to python will be frustrating at first because of all the errors you get that the compiler didn't warn you about. Like, if you're used to it, it's jarring to not have spell-check, but then if you stop being lazy about it, your spelling improves and it's not actually that big a deal anymore most of the time. It's hard to give more specific "do x" advice without knowing what your framework is, but here are some things that have helped me get better at programming, and python specifically: Things to do in your spare time, lunch break etc: 1. Watch youtube videos of PyCon talks. If you get bored or your attention starts to wander, click the settings and change the speed to 1.25x or 1.5x. I watch most things at 1.5x these days, and it helps a lot. [Raymond Hettinger is my current favorite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf-BqAjZb8M) speaker. [David Beazley gives good talks too](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzfHjytDceU), but some of them are kind of obscure arcane stuff. 2. Try to find the answers to unanswered StackOverflow questions under the python tag. You can help people with even less experience than you, get free internet points, and learn stuff about a language at the same time. Things to do during work: 1. Read The Fucking Manual (RTFM)--if you're using a module a lot, stop and read through the doc on it. It's dry as shit, but if you can do it you'll often get a much better understanding than following a tutorial that teaches by rote. I did tutorials first and remained really confused about the `threading` and `multiprocessing` modules. Then I finally buckled down and just spent 20 minutes reading the docs, and now it's just obvious. That said, doc quality can vary quite a bit. I've read docs for the excel interop COM Objects in C# that contributed almost nothing to my ability to use them, but python docs have been pretty good. 2. Look for opportunities to make the existing code better. When I get frustrated hacking away on a hard problem, I take a few minutes break by better organizing the code that's already there. How could the same functionality be written more simply? How could it be more pythonic? Can easily bring any of the pieces closer to a pure function? Is there anything that gets repeated which could be extracted into a pure function or made into a loop? Is there any simple way to make it serve a more generic case? Are the function/variable names the best they could be? is there a way I could change it so that what it does is *so obvious* at a glance that I no longer need explicit comments? 3. Write some tests. Most people with your length of experience aren't writing in a test driven development style, and most code bases don't have 100% test coverage. Think about the problem that your most recent *working* but untested code is solving and see if you can come up with a small set of tests that *proves* that the code does what it should.
I've been meaning to look into using pathlib to potentially get rid of some boilerplate path manipulation but I really hate the use of "/" to construct weird non Pythonic statements to build paths. 
Well, if you insist so much, I'll try to port my project to 3.x
&gt; How do I get BETTER? Getting better at something new requires your brain to be empty and open for learning, not full of static data. The best way of achieving that is to dump everything that you learn off your brain, just swap it to disk like computer does it with RAM. Use some kind of personal wiki to document every new small task that you learn. It worked for me when I was learning the basics of Tkinter. The Python module has decent docstrings, but they are not as complete as the Tcl help, which I had to consult too. For example: I wanted to learn how to change the color of a text label. I would read the source code, write a trivial example, then write a short wiki page, give it a good name, add a few relevant tags and put that small code snippet there. That way everything I learned was always just one search away.
if you could explain 5, 6 and 8 that would have been more clear for what you are doing .
If i enroll after the 1st of December will i still be able to access it
absolutely the red will give that touch of dangerous needed by a bomb! :)
You can use [joinpath](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html#pathlib.PurePath.joinpath) instead if you prefer it.
Last I saw? Twisted hasn’t moved to 3.x. :( (That said, everything else I do in Python, I do in 3.4.4.)
*snort* I am amused. 
Build small. Iterate the living F out of these tests. I’m not sure what more you can do when bouncing between languages and working with a framework that is poorly-documented. Go small. Iterate. Use TDD/BDD. Buy the local guru a pizza and pick their brain for an hour. That’s about the best advice I can think of in this instance. 
Is this supposed to make any sense?
Awesome. Thanks very much.
thank you Al! that's my Christmas gift!!
Database is in your backend, you can make SELECT queries on it to get data in python. To display it in a nice table, that’s your front end (HTML/JavaScript/CSS).
3.6 is [faster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d65dCD3VH9Q) and [uses less memory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p33CVV29OG8).
I think you should check BODMAS. It will clear up a lot of such magic.
Yeah, sure In the cell 5, we 1) create a Dataframe that will be structure the data plotted by Holoviews : the index is the variable "t" and we have "x" and "y" the prey and predator population. 2) initialize the Buffer with the skel we setup in 1), that will store N (here 200) instance of this dataframe (filled by the results of our simulation). 3) create a holoviews DynamicMap that connect the `curve` function to the buffer : all data sent to the buffer will be displayed using this function. in the cell 6, we use streamz to setup a pipeline. All data sent to the stream will go through 2 different paths : 1) one that will convert the data to a dataframe with the proper structure (as expected by the `curve` function, then send it to the buffer 2) another that will concatenate the results of the simulation, and save it on disk every 10 iteration The cell 8 is the main cell as all the computation is done inside. We 1) create a xarray dataset that will store the results : that data structure allow to use attributes and coordinates systems. This can be seen as a smart collection of numpy array. 2) iterate while t didn't reach a tmax (or infinite loop if tmax is None or False) 3) compute one step, and update our xarray Dataset with the new values (for t, x and y) 4) send our xarray Dataset through our pipeline (and result to updating the DynamicMap, and saving the data) 
For the sake of those of us who don't know R particularly well and like Python enough to be on a Python subreddit, what makes this "obviously superior"?
I think it is sarcasm, coz R is a woeful language for anything but perhaps statistics
I had a use case where I needed to process the commandline params from left to right. The program was an emulator of an old graphics minicomputer that used papertape. The idea was that the commandline args would be read from left to right, interpreting them as commands like "mount a papertape on the reader", "start the computer executing at the given address", "set the console data switches", etc. Look in the "Console usage" section of the [README](https://github.com/rzzzwilson/pymlac). The actual code to interpret the sys.argv parameters starts at line 122 in [the main() function](https://github.com/rzzzwilson/pymlac/blob/master/pymlac/pymlac). However, if you don't have this sort of special case then it's far better to use one of the "standard" modules.

If you were building anything new after just three weeks, I'd be very worried. And if you quit your first job after 3 weeks, you're going to have trouble finding your second. 
Docs for the new logging capture: https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/logging.html Yessss. I was just wondering why I couldn't get records of log output when tests failed. Maybe pytest 3.3 will fix it. In the interim, I started using https://github.com/eisensheng/pytest-catchlog.
Thank you for sharing this gift with all of us!
Sorry, that’s all I got. But you can look it up on Stack Overflow which is where I found out how to do it properly. Just search “modules pip python 3”
I bought your book, and it's on the reading pile, cos I think it's super important to super absolute bad asses like yourself. Thanks for releasing this course, and the book for free. You're the real MVP. :)
Thanks man, I've been getting info python recently and went through all your free vids and some lectures on youtube. I was gonna make full version of this course a christmas gift for myself - guess youre the Santa this year ! 
I guess many will use it domain hacks unrelated to python (snap.py, grum.py, etc).
Thanks for this! Your book gave me the inspiration I needed to actually learn Python instead of dabbling. I keep a copy of your book proudly displayed on my bookshelf at work.
I like Spyder, which is provided free with the Anaconda Python distribution. Apparently, there is no monetary support for further development of Spyder?
So it's not actually compatible with Flask-SQLAlchemy in a real way then. It's compatible in a "well, it'll horribly break your application" way.
I doubt the ORM will ever been compatible with asyncio. But the layers below that have been made compatible via aiopg and aiomysql, which includes the ORM-like core/SQL expressions.
I've never used Udemy before, will this course be permanently free to me if I get it before the deadline?
Actually the question is about user interface. You can either make a GUI, which is a graphical user interface using Tkinter. You can also make a webpage "as" a user interface by PHP, Python, and many other languages. If you want to use Python, Flask is a good web framework which you can do this stuff. Bottle is similar.
What are those?
My first stint with Python was during my internship. I was doing DPI for Set-Top Box testing at the network level. Later I have used Python extensively to write automation scripts, browser automation tests. Off lately, I have been using Python to build a Slack bot which runs automated tasks for developers.
They are text editors. I would be surprised if /r/learnpython did not have a list of suggested editors... Either they or the Python wiki.

I don't see how using an IDE would get in the way? It's just convenient, as opposed to a text editor
I bought this course a while ago and really recommend it!
Yes, you can treat the ETag value like a hash: &gt; An ETag is an opaque identifier assigned by a web server to a specific version of a resource found at a URL. If the resource representation at that URL ever changes, a new and different ETag is assigned. Used in this manner ETags are similar to fingerprints, and they can be quickly compared to determine whether two representations of a resource are the same.
I'm really looking forward to that! You're a good teacher and the fact that you teach using real life examples, while giving a base code to use is a true gift! 
[What the shit?](https://i.imgur.com/jFRTgmL.jpg) No handouts for you today.
Thanks AL. ATBS was the first programming tutorial I used before I got my first programming job at 28. I don't use python much (mostly powershell and javascript) but that section on email automaton made programming click for me.
My input code is: investment_amount= float(input(‘Enter the investment amount: ‘)) The thought that was occuring to me was doing something like: while investment_amount== str: print(“Error: You can’t have a non-numeric entry”) investment_amount= float(input(‘Enter the correct investment amount: ‘)) When I did this python couldn’t convert the string to a float value and the general red error message came up instead of mine.

Just use IDLE, bundled with python and is a totally bare bones IDE great to fool around in. I personally use Spyder, VS Code, or Jupyter notebooks depending on what I'm doing.
asyncio is kinda twisted re-inventede in stdlib.
Thanks will do
I wouldnt dream of quitting. Not my style. I love learning and I want to be the best that i can be. I just feel like I am holding myself to a standard that maybe isn't realistic. Many of these comments are very helpful in removing some of my fears. 
https://gist.github.com/dideler/2395703 has a relevant snippet. This has several examples of parsing argv by hand. https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/10-cmdline/
There is a good example here: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/flask/flask_sqlite.htm
In my experience it depends on if they are Python beginners or coding beginners. I set up a Spyder3 environment that has the exact same layout as Matlab's default for co-workers to get them started on Python. But for someone new to programming in general Thonny is a much better option IMHO.
Just the other day, I was wondering which South American officials I would have to bribe to get something like that.
r/the_hoser I was using a counter result[0] should be result[c]. 
IDLE is a lot more cumbersome to multitask in though, its easier to follow online tutorials/look up functions when you don't have to manage 3 windows at the same time
There isn't one. The only difference is that you can do stuff like `'double "quotes" inside single quotes'` or `"vice 'versa'"`.
I don't think it makes a difference, but be consistent whichever you choose.
Kind of. It was about a year into learning when I had a 'whoa' moment and realized that I wasnt learning Python anymore, I was using Python. Things like picking data types (list vs dict vs set vs OrderedDict) now come naturally, finding new libraries is now exciting because they simplify my code instead of feeling overwhelmingly difficult to understand (including common libraries like Flask. Seems dauting at first, is now a breeze to use), stack traces are now super useful and, usually, point me directly to a problem I can solve instead of leading me in frustrating circles. Now, when I need to solve a problem, I've used enough of the Python standard library, know of enough 3rd party libraries, and have solved enough problems that I can think, 'ok I need these tools (flask, sqlalchemy, sets, jinja2), I'll start "here", build to "there", and see where I need to go next'. There's still a lot of python functionality that I need to dig into, like Meta Classes and concurrency, I'm not great at fully mapping out programs in my head before starting, and my overall CS skills can be lacking at times, so I don't consider myself advanced. But, it's getting there
Why don't you paste the actual code then, instead of a transcription.
I did but this was from a test page and I didn't notice the issue.
That's good to know, thanks for clearing that up
What about buying him a Raspberry Pi so he could get into programming himself?
You could use [pyfilesystem](https://www.pyfilesystem.org/) to eliminate a lot of path logic.
A test page? Are you trying to get people to do your homework for you?
So how do you get around this? I understand how async gets around the blocking in general, but going from 4 procs (3 in the pool and 1 for the sockets) to 1 doesnt seem like a way to improve performance (as you'll eventually have enough coros going to saturate the thread)
A little game with pygame, maybe. Narrating how and where you met with basic top-down 2D graphics.
Continuing on my trading bot. To actually make the trades, it uses the Robinhood API. The thing I think makes mine a little more different than other bots is the fact that it uses the community for suggestions. It parses the top stock subreddits and Twitter profiles to determine the consensus of a ticker (BUY/SELL). If the ticker has enough of a trend going, it'll put the ticker on the suggestion stack and run some analysis on it to determine what the best course of action would be. The only catch is how Robinhood allows day traders, you need $25k in non-margins to be considered to day trade.
Thonny is great. I wished it had existed when I started out learning Python. Nothing wrong with starting off with Thonny and then later on use a more full fledged IDE like PyCharm. Depending if you want to go all out hardcore, you could also learn VIM later too especially if you will be using Linux-bases OSes, SSH, etc...
I personally use `"` by default because that way it's simpler to include `'` if the string needs to include an apostrophe or even quotes. When I'm juggling 2 languages, such as generating HTML, I'll pick one type for each language.
I'm still playing with https://github.com/foxmask/django-th a project to automate grabing stuff from one point of the web and pushing that one to another point of the web. Like IFTTT.com :)
His book his meant for beginners, and the Udemy course for it is free until dec 1st (book is free online too). I highly recommend it
Does the Redbull have to be sugar free?
&gt; a sense of pride and accomplishment Al Steigwart != EA Games
Just started the course yesterday. I like it so far.
A full fledged IDE has a LOT of stuff that can confuse beginners. Depending on the IDE you might have a bunch of crap that you don't need or understand thrown into your face.
I'd guess one of the main arguments for vim is that it's a lot faster than most IDEs and once you are proficient in a language you won't need a lot of the help that an IDE offers you (most the time anyways)
And maybe run a little SSH server on it so you can work together on the same code remotely :P
Given thonny is a very beginner friendly IDE this is irellevant to me.
Funny you mention other languages. I remember SQL giving me a hard time with single and double quotes.
&gt; Apparently, there is no monetary support for further development of Spyder? (*Spyder maintainer here*) We are looking for new ways of funding, but we will continue development as usual (just at a much slower pace).
That's fine, your question wasn't about Thonny though. You asked how using an IDE would get in the way.
fixed. :)

I'm using Python and Selenium to scrape product data from a website (with permission, I should add) that isn't included in the company's public API.

Do not want to succeed my test dev server configuration :) --[lighttpd + webpy via proxy
I use `'` just because it looks cleaner than `"`. Except for docstrings, which are conventionally always `"""`
IDEs are usually intended towards standard project management patterns, which will always be more advanced yo someone who is just starting. I'd recommend you learn the language in a simpler text editor first, and when you're able to manage a biggrr project yourself choose the tools that save you the most time with repetitive tasks. 
I added support for GUI's like turtle, tkinter, matplotlib, etc... to my [real-time python evaluator](https://github.com/Almenon/AREPL). As you edit the code the GUI automatically restarts. Here's a simple demo program: import turtle def square(size): for _ in range(4): turtle.forward(size) turtle.left(90) for i in range(100): square(i*4+100) turtle.left(9) The result: [link](https://puu.sh/yvfrS/95eac7ba63.png)

Thonny is essentially that, a simple text editor with syntax highlighting and shell attached. I get that most IDE's are very complex, but thonny isn't and that's the entire point of my post. I don't understand why several people here are trying to turn me off IDE's when it's just a more convenient text editor... Thonny isn't meant to be advanced, you're all missing the point.
If you could do PyQt support that'd be the cat's meow.

Does robinhood still give you free trades when you're considered a day trader?
I was looking for a sax-like deserializer for msgpack in python. Since I couldn't find one just wrote it myself. The output is inspired by ijson and it pretty much has the same number of events as output. Feel free to check it and let me know if you have any questions, concerns and etc. 
Is Udemy a good base to learn on? I am very hesitant as there are so many throw away course websites.
Yup. Pretty sweet deal.
As a beginner it read clearly to me. Keep it going, I want to know what's outside of the room..
The problem is beginner-friendliness. Vim/Emacs is the **last** thing they should try here. Notepad++ though... Note: I use vim. 
Trying to get caffeinated not fat.
After the course has been completed and some projects are made ! What should we focus on for future learning ? And thanks for the course OP!
Last year I used pygame (because windows lacks curses) to write a small "happy new year" program that would randomly display said phrase in 3 languages and "launch" rockets which "explode" into random shapes at random positions. :P
Thanks! All signed up for it. 
Thanks, I have been picking up a lot of Udemy courses lately and this will go nicely with those. 
Thank you sir.
I've been working in a brand new web interface for the last couple weeks, so I've only been using JavaScript. The pain is real...
Yeah get your priorities straight
I am struggling on whether to build a ryzen server. having a headless server will teach me a lot, but I will need to put in the time.
I don't disagree, except that this is not a new TLD. I think it's a bad idea to have domains like .exe, .zip, etc. Here: https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/09/many-new-top-level-domains-have-become-internets-bad-neighborhoods/ But this is a country domain extension that existed already before Python became so popular.
IDLE was designed for beginners and is included with the Python distribution.
More corrupt than the ICANN which is US based? I don't think so. The ICANN is criticized by almost everyone involved in the domain industry as an organization that is the opposite of transparency.
What issues did you have with Pycharm? You load it, you click create project, you add a py file and it works? 
I prefer to use " because I find ' more often in a string: "don't", "can't" for example. 
You're trying to access a column called `date_added` that doesn't exist in the database on that server. The "HINT" in the error message points out that a column called "dat**a**_added" does exist; did you make a typo when you were setting up the database?
Your question is suspiciously similar to a very recent question asked by someone, who's one post history could be described as alarmingly racist or incompetently trolling. Nonetheless, if you would like an answer, describe what you mean by error trap, as this terminology is not used in python. Maybe give an example for a numeric error trap.
You'll want to use a ["while" loop](https://wiki.python.org/moin/WhileLoop) to get it to ask for another order after one is placed. Before your loop is opened, you will want to set a flag variable. Inside of this loop, you will need a test to check the state of the flag variable after each iteration of the code in the loop. If the flag is activated, it indicates that the loop should close and the program should end. All of this is explained in the above link. For it to print out the customer's total, there are two things you will need to change. After the number of orders has been entered, calculate the total using your equation: orderTotal = int(x) * meal * tax + deliveryfee Then, use the orderTotal variable instead of the full equation in your "if" statement: if budget &gt;= orderTotal:
Thank you!
Neat homework problem. Good luck with it.
Thanks for the response. I've had little free time recently due to school but I'm looking forward to diving back into Python. I really like the way the language is structured in that it's fairly easy to follow the code as compared to, say, C++ (mostly because it requires whitespace and doesn't need to be compiled). Do you have any examples of things you did while you still considered yourself a beginner? As in, ideas for my own projects. I've only completed the MITx Python course and am looking for new material and ideas all the time.
I haven't heard of BeeWare. It looks interesting and worth tracking! I am not a professional developer so it would be hard to justify the time to learn and even become good at a native language. It BeeWare can (even eventually) give me more freedom, I am very happy!
I think its a freshmen in my python class that posted that actually I think I heard him and his friend laughing about it— An error trap is the same as an input validation loop. For example: while num &lt;0: print(“ERROR: The number is not supposed to be a negative number.”) num= float(input(‘Enter the correct number: ‘)) This validates the input is not negative and I need to do this, but with non numeric inputs.
Can someone explain the pseudocode running gag to me?
It was just really overwhelming with too many things i didn't understand but thought i had to understand to write python. At this point i hadn't even figured out that python comes with IDLE + shell.
Maybe it is a typo and they meant "Late 80s?" Quick google gives us: Conceived in 1989 and first published code 1991
I believe there was a trick though like you can do 'don'/t' or something like that and it will still print as don't
I don't see anything wrong with your code. I'll bet you meant `os.walk('buildbackup')` instead of `os.walk('/buildbackup')` (relative not absolute path). 
This really should be in /r/learnpython Also, if you indent every line with four spaces, it will format as code 
Not a professional web developer here, but, if you need to refresh the info in a page without pressing f5, you might need some javascript. Also, I've been working with django and it is a very easy to use framework, specially if you are focused on the speed of the development.
What do you mean a negative non-numeric inputs?
I have been spending a lot of time using "Rodeo" by Yhat lately. It is pretty simple. I like it a lot, but that might be my data focused career bleeding through. 
sure will post it there.yes its /buildbackup.Any comments ?
Python is much simpler in its syntax than other languages. Mostly just whitespace without braces and semicolons, etc. So if you ever wrote pseudocode for some other language like: for each entry in the array do some stuff That looks a lot like working Python.
I think you should use whatever you have currently. To be honest I am not sure that tooling is the issue, and you should just concentrate on the python without getting distracted by choosing tools. It'll take you a half hour to get used to working with multiple windows or tabs and after that you'll look back at this question and say "WTF was I doing?"
This is amazing. Thank you.
Just leave out the float function call, then your num variable will contain the string the user enters at the input prompt. What are the criteria you want to validate against?
You are right, but I'm too lazy to type that extra \ each time
￼Google "python history" and the Google blurb gives us &gt; Python was conceived in the late 1980s, and authors are paid to write, not read. 
Go back and read your assignment on functions. Then read the side bar.
Backslash on the danish keyboard layout is completely retarded, i keep forgetting the shortcut
Have you migrated your database?
I’ve programmed a bit in python recently but i personally don’t think it’s sooo much different to, say, java.... yes, some fundamental paradigms are different but overall...
Django or Flask. I would recommend learning Django as it's a much more feature full framework. Django is opinionated about the way things should be built. This is great for big projects with multiple developers because I know where everything is going to be, assuming the other devs followed best practice. Django kind of forces your into best practice, you can break the rules but it's hard to do easily. My thinking is that smarter people than me have thought hard about these things and defined best practice. But if I really want to break the rules, I can. Django's big draw card (for me) is the ORM, which makes it really easy to manage large databases. Flask is like a stripped down version of Django. Flask can be made to do anything, but you're going to be inventing a lot of things, or implementing third party modules (like SQLAlchemy). Once you understand Django you'll intuitively understand what Flask is... But not the other way around. Django is also a very employable skill... So if you're looking for a job...
&gt; n called date_added that does No I dont think I did. My models.py says date-add
Hey! I'm a fourth year university student in the US, I'm taking a beginners python class next semester (last one before I graduate). Most of my current programming experience is in R but I really want to get into the more general purpose python language. Also I lived in Stuttgart for 5 years when I was a kid and it would be cool to practice my German again!
But when you write pseudocode for java it looks like python, that's the joke. /u/PhaethonPrime's example is pseudocode you would write for java that would probably work in python.
The database doesn't match your models.py, and that's causing the problem you're seeing. If you're using Django migrations to manage the database, make sure they've been run and are typo-free. 
I'm a programmer and each year I create a Christmas morning quest for my kids. They get the URL and that gives them the first clue. They solve that and get the second clue, etc. The clues are puzzles, locations in our neighborhood, cyphers, whatever I can think of. Eventually they get to open their 'big' gift. This year I'm going to incorporate our [Alexa](https://developer.amazon.com/alexa-skills-kit) and [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/). Backend I use Flask because I'm looking to knock out code fast. But I have been thinking of using [Glitch](https://glitch.com/) this year. Alternatively you could program him an interactive story (perhaps about your relationship or an inside joke) using [RenPy](https://www.renpy.org/). I've been thinking about doing that for my wife's 2nd grade classroom. Sort of a choose your own adventure including all the kids in class. Just remember as with all software projects, projects built with love, take way longer than you think they will. Keep it simple and add features as time allows. Better to give something that works than something that is half-done and broken (with apologies to my wife for that jewelry box, I promise I'll finish it some day).
You talked about indexes and slid right into slices, giving the impression that they are the same thing or related. I think you need to make it more clear that an index and a slice are very different, and one returns an element while the other returns an iterable. Also, I think you should address this common python question: new = old_list[10:2] # :( I wanted a slice in reverse but I get empty results Beginners are spoiled with the start and end defaults that auto-adjust depending on the step direction and then are surprised the the step argument always defaults to 1. 
I'm sorry I wasn't sure where to post I will keep this in mind.

PILlow is an image I/O library with some basic, often poorly implemented, image manupulation utilities. For computing, you should convert it to a `numpy.ndarray`. Use `numpy.meshgrid` (or equivalently `numpy.mgrid`) to setup your coordinate matrices `p` and `q`. 
Thanks. Unfortunately it's now showing "The coupon code entered has sold out."
it makes sense, thanks
Solved it. Running anaconda-navigator --reset through the anaconda prompt did it. And I feel like an idiot.
ty, ill try that and see if it works
That’s a really great idea I hadn’t thought of that, thank you! 
this is so me 
Suggestion: add `build` and `dist` to the `.gitignore` file you don't have. Normally we don't upload those directories to GitHub. My feeling is that for `msgpack` to be more useful you would have to define a protocol for extended types that can manage common Python containers, such as: * tuples * `__dict__` classes that don't have state (i.e. can be created with `__new__`) * `__slots__` classes that don't have state * `numpy.ndarray`s 
Hey man, Awesome idea! I'm in New Zealand and keen to learn. Let me know if you're still looking for folk and how things will work (thinking time difference here).
That sounds amazing - let´s switch to the private chat :)
Best of luck! Here a hints: use random.randint to get number between 1-6.
We're not here to do your homework for you.
So I want to understand your question completely. The way I read that is that you found someone that posted code, that you couldn't understand, and are asking others to post code doing the same thing, that you won't understand, because you're not willing to invest the time in learning what the code does? Have I got it? May want to rethink your career choice.
Your doubt in me only fuels my quest for knowledge
Thank you! I don't understand though. Can you post the code to make the simulator?
sublime is nice - simple enough to use as a beginner but has a fair bit of features that will keep you happy as your skill progresses. i personally moved to visual studio '15, which is also easy to use for a beginner but has a LOT of under the hood power.
I use “ to keep it consistent with JSON, otherwise it indeed makes no difference.
LMAO, what quest for knowledge? You want someone to give you the answer. That's not questing for knowledge, that's skipping to the end without understanding the process. It's a pretty vital step in the learning process if you are actually interested in learning.
To everyone who is being so, so mean to me just for asking questions: remember as Bill Gates once said, be nice to nerds, since one day they'll run all the biggest companies 
I figured it out. I forgot to post. for recordset in return_stored_procedure: sp_results.append(dict(zip(sp_column_names, recordset))) only append if overdue is under 30 sp_results = [l for l in sp_results if l['days_column'] &lt; 30] 
That was obviously an arbitrary number. But even at 1000 requests per second, you would prefer to not have to run 1000 workers at the same time. If you really want to do that, you would have to do some serious Auto Scaling of worker machines, unless you like having most of your workers idle most of the time, wasting money. And Auto Scaling is a whole other bag of issues, requiring additional investments.
Hmm, that's funny since earlier this year in Excel I coded for a new graph that showed data about car sales. My TA said it was the best one they'd ever seen! So I guess I have no quest for knowledge? Um, suuuure
I see it at 10$ :/
Sounds like you either have no idea about Java or about Python or both…
Yeah, thanks for educating me, stranger
You're welcome. ;)
Thanks robert for the suggestion. I don't know why the .gitignore file was missing from the repository. Just pushed it. Also, added dist and build directories to the gitignore and cleaned the former commits. About the second part of your comment, I think it's a very good point. But, I'm not sure if I fully understand or agree with it. So please let me know if I didn't clearly understand your point. I think one of the main goals of msgpack and similar serialization libraries is to be platform/language independent. Including special types specific to a language is some how in contrary with that. For example, tuples are basically fixed length lists and some languages may not differentiate between them as python does There can be extensions for such types as you suggested, but it makes those types some how useless or redundant in other languages if not uninterpretable. Unless you want a custom version of msgpack only for python. But, I feel it makes more sense for that to be wrapper library around msgpack parser? I'm not sure if I understand the difference between classes that defines __slots__ and those that don't when it comes to serialization! 
I'm willing to hire a Python programmer to program a dumb game assignment for me I will pay a fixed price that can be negotiated if you agree to the job its a one time project and I imagine it's not hard for someone with experience to pull off. Basically, it needs to be a unique version of Rock Paper Scissors and it needs to include a few basic things. I'll go over in more detail if anyone is interested.
At work I'm re-writing one of those most horrendous pieces of garbage I've ever seen (Shitty scala with textbook anti-pattern usage of actors) so that I can improve speed and give my colleagues the ability to actually read it. Spare time I'm working on a trading bot but I'm too much of a wimp to allow it to use my funds yet, so it requires email confirmation to push an order through (also fuck broker fees...).
I think there is a some sort of bug with the 3.3.0 I had to pin my project to pytest&lt;3.3.0 today I didn't look at details just a glance on their github repo. So check before upgrading Pytest is awesome probably something minor happened with the release I don't know :|
It say it's 10€
Python’s mobile story is still a sad one. Kivy is alright for games, but it looks unprofessional for other apps and, last I checked, was still working only with 2.x syntax. Beeware is ambitious but again very much beta software at best (again last i checked, about a year ago). The best chance Python had was Nokia Maemo/Meego; that was heavily based on Qt so it was pretty easy to build native apps with PyQt or PySide. The silly managers at Nokia, however, never opened their appstore to Python apps, and eventually killed the platform altogether. It has been reborn under the Jolla name but it’s now even more niche than before. In theory you could probably also write an html app, then use one of those “python-like” frameworks like brython or coffeescript. Again it would not look native, and it would probably be slow, but easy to package.
I watched it 3 times. Now I can do it in one.
Could you please expand further on this rather than being snarky about it ? I did consider r/learnpython but this seemed to be more of a generic problem / question about libraries, so I thought /r/python might be the better suited place for it.

cron-like thing to periodically check stuff and send me a notification (thought ifttt) based on certain conditions. In my case that would be if certain content on a website changes, if I need to do something wrt. the weather before going outside, if I have something on my shopping list etc
Hey, can you post your code there? Also, the "print" part probably means to "print" it to the console window, not actually print it.
Obviously he hasn't. Try to run python manage.py migrate on heroku.
Would you consider this to be a "homework level" problem ? I mean, thinking about it, it seems rather difficult. A structure that does this "correctly" if the hierarchy of keys is set (e.g. key of type 1 leads to key of type 2... etc leads to key of type n A structure that does this in an excellent way would probably have to do some amount of run-time profiling to re-arrange itself (e.g. see which keys are usually a direct hit and see which keys usually require some form of iteration, place the former in a hash map and place the later in a map (as in the classic O(Log(n)) search speed but also O(Log(n)) search speed for a &gt; x and a &lt; y). As far as I can tell the default map in python is a both a hash map but also keeps the keys in order, and implement nothing like equal_range or lower_bound... so it would also involve writing bindings for (or writing from scratch) a map, which is a trivial problem if you want it to be ok but not if you want it to be as close to perfect as possible. Overall it seems to be far from a trivial problem to implement a multimap or other such structure that does this efficiently. (Keeping in mind that filtering a list is in python O(n)... so I wouldn't call that efficient, at least not for a long list, it would also be a solution to filter the list and add hits to a hash map cache, but, again, it may be confusing for readers of the code and unless you have high key re-occurance it will only add memory overhead)
$10 here too. was this a limited sale?
I've submitted a simple game example (asteriods / pysteroids) to that site. Thanks for the advice.
Coupon sold out. Any more? I like python programming courses in general any recommendations would be appreciated as well.
Can you elaborate on your issues with code academy? I thought the course was pretty good, if too short.
None of us need to prove it. Most of us already took that class and passed it years ago. If you can't figure out something as simple as picking a few random numbers between 1 and 6 then you need to ask your teacher for help, not us.
Sure, well yeah just change the location calc code so it iterates over a range of dates, I did something similar with this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLx6DX8xHb0&amp;t=6s
x+=(x*1.5)
I have made code which makes animations of the orbits by iterating over time (see here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLx6DX8xHb0&amp;t=6s). This code however basically resets every day and gives the new positions of that day

How are you doing the sentiment analysis? Do you have a github?
Alright, everyone, I think I figured it out. Can someone just confirm or deny that this is how it works? I typed print("1") in the console and did the same six times but with different numbers. Now the user just randomly picks a number off the top of their head and runs that line 
I use: `'` for strings, because then I can use `"` in those strings, and OSes and JSON need the double-quote. I use `'''` for docstrings, and then `"""` for commenting out large blocks of code. In this way I can comment out entire blocks of functions or classes. 
AFAICT, this is being compared to the eventlet worker under gunicorn. This relies upon expensive monkeypatching of blocking Python methods so that they are non-blocking. Which means **both versions are using async**. The benchmarks here should be comparing to traditional Apache / mod_wsgi or a similar wsgi container running threads. 
It's not so much that I don't trust the code of the bot... I'm quite confident the code does what I intend it to do. What I'm not confident in is that what I intend it to do are not strategies which will make me loss money rapidly :p
&gt; Reading the request from client, querying DB, receiving results from DB, sending reply to client are all operations that benefit from async. except [they don't](http://techspot.zzzeek.org/2015/02/15/asynchronous-python-and-databases/) when you see something 3x faster, question the benchmarks first. This is comparing an eventlet-monkeypatched setup to plain asyncio. It should be comparing against threads.

Tried updating pip itself? ``py -m pip install --upgrade pip`` 
Well, Wikipedia says it "First appeared" in 1991 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)
My point still stands. 
I had a boss who (when he was young) used POKE to hose his OS by accident, because what is memory safety anyway?
I started with PyCharm as it was the easiest set-it-and-forget it program. But I think I know what you're saying about being overwhelmed at first. Now I mainly use Spyder or VSCode w/Python Plugins.
Who needs ring -2 thru 3 when you have 'One Ring to Rule Them All'
Yes, I remember deciding to use Python on linux systems in early 1979. This became a much better idea in 1991.
Pretty much. jQuery can easily do what he wants. In a quick and dirty application, I have a Python program write to a JSON file. In the remote browser, jQuery checks every Xsec for a change and then reloads the data value in that element. I'm sure there's a better way. But like I said, it was quick.
* Doesn't teach how to actually use python tools outside of their site, such as IDLE and shell * A lot of things were poorly explained and left me guessing * It's candy, not beef. The whole premise of the site is supposed to introduce people to programming, and it does, but it has it's fair share of limitations and it motivates people to rush through the course instead of learn outside of the website. * Too big of a focus on syntax instead of problem solving. Codecademy always provides you with the things you need in a step to step fashion which eliminates critical thinking. * Python 2.7 All in all it's just a shallow learning experience. Yes it's a good introduction and it is fun, but it's not enough for me. I got to around 60% of the codecademy course and while watching Automate the boring stuff with python just today i've learned more about how all the different functions and tools actually work than i did before. People learn in different ways though so to each their own.
Also try cocaine, but just use little doses, I can't stress enough "little" in little doses. Just a tiny tiny amount. It helps you code better.
No, that’s really helpful feedback. I’m way more likely to buy the course now. Thank you!
Any chance that you would be willing to share the code behind the updates? Or if not the code itself some of the methodology behind it? I have wanted to do something like this for the longest time
It's complicated because when Twisted started, Python packaging and distribution basically had no usable tooling. So the Twisted package is effectively a mini-distribution of lots of largely independent sub-packages all jammed together into a single package. As you'd expect, some of the weird/old/rarely used sub-packages are being slower to migrate. But the core of Twisted and the popular parts all have solid 3.x support now, and lots of people are deploying Twisted apps on 3.x. You have to check whether the particular parts of Twisted you use are ported, but there's a very good chance they are.

Don't forget the FCC, as long as were talking about corruption. And just the other day someone on r/webdev (I think), someone was complaining about a major US based registrar that would register domain names when they were searched for and then resell those same domains at a markup. A couple years ago I looked into getting a .py domain and all I found was a rather cryptic website from some Paraguayan authority. The page seemed odd and sparked my imagination. I imagine the politicians or bureaucrats in charge didn't appreciate the value of .py. At any rate, I'm really glad they're getting it going. btw: I never said anyone was more corrupt than anyone else.

It it similar to WeffRiddles?
Have you seen some of Linux's commands? I'm sure you can get frisky enough!
Ahahaha will do 
&gt; WeffRiddles Similar I think, in the sense that it is a series of puzzles. But the puzzles aren't done on the computer. They solve the puzzle which gives them an answer which they enter in to the computer which gives the the next puzzle. For example, one year I took a picture of a sign and edited so a word was missing. The clue was the edited picture. The kids recognized the sign, but couldn't remember the word. So they had to get dressed to go outside, walk the 1/4 mile down to the park to see the sign then come back and enter the missing word. That gave them the next puzzle. I try to mix that kind of thing with cyphers, word finds, etc.
Check out learnpythonthehardway.com (I think) or just Google learnpythonthehardway. Was one of the first course I did for free and is a great starter to get to an intermediate level as it will also let you down other paths.
If you build it, software will come.

Sounds awesome. Thanks for sharing
I wonder if programmers and authors share the statistic that programmers spend more time reading code than writing it?
This is primary school math: percentage = x * 1.5 x' = x + percentage x' = x + x * 1.5 x' = x * (1 + 1.5) x' = x * 2.5 x = x' / 2.5
Don't press F5. He's trolling. F5 turns down the keyboard backlight so you won't be able to see to type anymore. I think he thinks it's funny, but the joke's on us, as trolling is a mental illness.
If you think of x as 100%, and as you said in the question, the value you added as 150%, then your final value you ended up with is 250%. To get back to x (100%), you just need to find 2/5, or 40% of the final value, as that's the proportion the final value equals. Obviously if you want to expand this for other percentages, then you'll need to adjust the numbers, but it can always be done fairly simply by taking your final number, dividing it by the percentage of your original number, then multiplying by 100
Thanks! :D
Thanks! :D
Awesome! And good luck!
Fucking Elop. I was all abourd the meego hyper train... Then fucking Microsoft came along... :(
These books are pretty good if you want to get better at Python: Fluent Python, Effective Python, and Python Cookbook. I also like Programming Collective Intelligence as an intro to machine learning/neural network stuff. But of course, writing blog posts and tutorials is the best way to learn something. There were a lot of holes in my knowledge I didn't realize I had until I had to teach coding to others.
No curly braces. No semi colons. No parenthesis in our loops. Not a compiled language. Classes are very fluid. No type declarations for variables. Overall, python is very much pseudo code that runs. Java compiled code will look nothing like pseudo code. Extremely different languages.
os.walk works. It's probably operating system permissions or symlinks that are causing a problem. Or maybe you did what I did once and accidentally dragged a folder to a different location in the desktop, then went nuts when a directory parse failed.
Yeah, I hear you. I use Udemy because it's the only big site where you can create a course without having to be affiliated with a university. A few years back they did a big clean up of a lot of the scummy "You Can Make EZ Big Money In 4 Minutes" type courses. But at least Udemy has a 30 day refund policy (I think they still do, anyway). Coursera and edX have good reputations, especially if you want to learn more computer sciencey stuff instead of just coding.
Sound interesting. How is your progress? I wanted​ to do something similar. Maybe I can steal some ideas/code from you :)
The numbering I'm guessing you mean the index, which counts the rows and is part of the dataframe? Try: print(df.to_string(index=False)) or: print(df.to_csv(sep='\t', index=False))

Hm, wouldn't spawning a bunch of instances and sticking them behind a reverse proxy solve most of the concurrency problems? Obviously that requires a well separated architecture, but if you're concerned about scaling fixing the architecture should be your first stop no?
A good friend of mine made a maze game for her boyfriend as a part of a long quest / hint hunt for his birthday. It was so cool. It was, however, the other way around - he was the programmer and she was a graphics designer / Sass + HTML coder. She had very little knowledge of programming, but she made it and she even encoded the hidden message in the source code, because she knew he would check that first as a shortcut. I think you should stick to something simple, yet meaningful for you two and your relationship. I'd combine what /u/yourcsguy and /u/joshuahunter said. The game would be the climax of some sort of an adventure you could set up. And remember, even a text-based RPG is going to make him insanely happy because he'll know you made it just for him and there are things only you two would understand.

Fair enough, sir! Thank you!
numba is a jit compiler. It can target cuda, but it can also target smp/multicore operations. accelerate.cuda is just for cuda. A practical way to look at it is to use numba unless you are specifically making something for a GPU enabled environment. For instance, I work on a laptop, workstation, and a cloud server. The laptop and the server don't have (useful) cuda. So I selectively compiled numba with a different target depending on which platform I'm on. I wouldn't be able to do that with accelerate.cuda.
Thank you very much!! =)
Fantastic. Thanks! 
Thanks for all the input. in the end, this worked: data = openSql('SELECT * FROM Main WHERE Title LIKE %s OR Notes LIKE %s', ('%'+theSearch+'%', '%'+theSearch+'%')) I then use the cursor: cursor.execute(command, variables) Python is VERY picky about syntax.
Can you expand a bit more on this. Once you have a Django channel / websocket connection established, what sort of plotting/graphing frontend are you using to display in a browser? 
Sadly, IRC. And the last time I really poked at it, that was still 2.7. But ... it may be well worth it to rummage around inside Twisted again. :) Your comment gives a quick reminder that, aha, this isn’t a monolithic blob.

 Hello there! I'm a graduate student from Ukraine. Programming with Python since 2013. Since then I implemented huge part of my bachelors and masters degree in Python (Bayesian network predictor + NLP). At this time I working with Django(Wagtail) and do a lot of server-side for my projects. But, for last few months, I spending time with *Unix, because my Dreamspark license "expired" and I need to switch from Win to Linux (Now I have the huge list of aliases, that help me in day-to-day work). What about materials, I have my own media center with saved video courses (various topics, tech related) and massive calibre library with a tonne of IT books. My own interest in participating in it, to find a small group that interested in Python and put effort toward same goals. I've missed this part, coz in my university group I was only one pythonguy. So, if I will find a few companions, that seriously interested in long-term and frequent discussions about Python and tech subjects - count me on board! Just PM me here.

&gt; /u/PhaethonPrime 's example is pseudocode you would write for java that would probably work in python. It wouldn't. But it isn't far off. for entry in the_array: do_some_stuff() on the other hand, is valid python. Of course, `the_array` would actually be a dynamically sized list that works more like a `std::vector` than an array. Unless it was actually a tuple, in which case it would behave like an array in memory, generally speaking, but would be immutable. Either way, the name would be a bit misleading. But is also totally something a non-python programmer would write.
I think it does what I need now, since it can be configured to check periodically, based on the time of day, or based on a cron-like string. But I haven't had it run for more than a few hours at a time yet, so bugs may happen. Source code at https://github.com/jonathangjertsen/ifttt_event_loop

Plus, if you comment out a large block of code that *already* has a docstring in it, you will have a syntax error if you try to docstring it out. Line comments don’t have this problem.
Open your console, type python. Then add a string variable like my_variable = “Hello world” then just type print my_variable That’s it

I would like to replicate this coordinate visualization on a map. I have a list of adjacent segments which are representative of transport trips or walks. It's important to display them with a certain transparency, overlayed on a map, to distinguish the most traveled zones (this kind of dark maps enhances the effect). Do you know of some tool in python the let me do that? For those who know it, this is the data visualization of Moveoscope, which is a third-part service for the iOS app Moves, which tracks your movements. Unfortunately this service is shutting down and I want to replicate it.

We are using a pretty basic setup right now, we just wanted to make things work. We just followed the tutorial from django channels page to setup everything. We are using c3 for plotting. Here is the rundown of the setup - apachi nifi processes a record and send it to our streaming api. - api saves the data stream and message is pushed out to the socket. We are using post save trigger here. - the post save trigger is what push the message out websocket through channel group call. - on the frontend we are using reconnecting web sockets js library to make everything work. We are just using django views here with basic django templates. This setup is good for prototyping for now as we are rewriting everything is react

Newish to python. What's the prod.py joke?
FYI, semicolons are actually optional in Python, and they allow you to delimit expressions so you can write multiple expressions on a single line that you’d normally have to write one separate lines. In [1]: x = 1; y = 2 In [2]: x Out[2]: 1 In [3]: y Out[3]: 2 
Wow, that's awesome to hear. Thank you!
&gt; guess youre the Santa this year ! I better start putting on weight then.
Don't feel like an idiot. I had the same issue a month back, it was a bad or failed update that messed something up. Had to do what you did to fix it.
:D Thanks!
The joke is that your pseudo code can be production code in python because the syntax is so simple.

&gt; Crate - A rust distributable package Crates seem more comparable to distributions, but this is an easy confusion to have on the Python side (distribution/package).
`for root, dirs, files in os.walk()` Make sure dirs is untouched inside of the loop. Semi-intentional, dirs is a reference of the same list used inside of `walk`. Otherwise if it isn't being messed with, print(dirs) at the top of each loop should show what paths walk reached. Last one, if there are any symbolic links in the directory path you are searching, you need to call walk with `followlinks=True` because it will skip them otherwise. 
Wow, thanks for telling me. I really appreciate hearing stories like this. :)

AlSweigart - Between the time your first free code ran out and when you issued another free code, I bought your course using the $10.00 code. Happy to have spent the money. You've got a great presentation voice! Also, I bought your paperback+ebook combo earlier today. My new job is allowing me to learn python on the job. You make it interesting. Thanks!

Heresy!
The thing we find on pipy.org/project/namehere is equivalent to crates.io/crate/namehere. Any external dependency you can distribute and install is a package/crate
This is not how it works.

I think [stackoverflow](https://nickcraver.com/blog/2016/02/17/stack-overflow-the-architecture-2016-edition/) is one of them 
print just means display - to the terminal by default. try looking up the builtin print function e.g. print("my text") 
If you have a medium or long mustache straws will literally change your life. They're amazing. But don't use that plastic shit that destroys the planet. Buy some stainless straws off Amazon. They're DIRT cheap. 
I'm being rather pedantic, but I think in cases like this where you are making comparisons it is important. Anyway, `namehere` would be called a distribution more properly, it could ship many or zero packages (usually folders with `__init__.py`).
I would avoid it. Use ‘python -m venv’ with python3.3+ virtualenv copies python binaries, but does not handle linked libraries embedded in the files. So if you build python from source and install in non-system directories using relative library paths, then it chokes. 
The best part about this example is that, assuming you had a list called array, your psuedo code loop is 2 words longer than the actual python code would be. (Minus the 'do some stuff' part).
Learning Python now. Is that better practice than X, Y = 1,2 ?
No, my example is not good practice, just a trivial example of using a semicolon.

Any reason you choose to use `lambda`, the construct for defining anonymous functions, to define a named function? I know it's not considered idiomatic Python but I've seen people doing it lately, is it a trend?
No reason. It's not really production code.
neither are good practice for simply defining variables for readability unless (maybe) they are arguably related, however your example has legitimate uses when destructuring a variable that already exists or you're handling the results from a function/method call. For example instance, is_created = create_or_update(config) colors = ('red', 'blue') ... my_fav, your_fav = colors another scenario is acceptable when you want to swap the value of variables a, b = b, a

Learning how to read python... No mater what language I learn the begging is always the most difficult. Anyone have any tips/tricks to learn python faster?
You sound fun
All python code in the extracted directory seems to be either corrupted or obfuscated. pyiboot01_bootstrap for example should've been straight python code. Either the extractor is bugged, or whoever packaged it made it look corrupted to prevent tampering. Both pyinstxtractor and pyinstaller's archive_viewer output the same, so I'm guessing obfuscation.
My default is to do the the same as the REPL. eg: &gt;&gt;&gt; str(123) '123' &gt;&gt;&gt; "\"" '"' &gt;&gt;&gt; '\'' "'" &gt;&gt;&gt; "'\"" '\'"' 
Thanks for sharing. &lt;3 
You can’t just put up a picture of some code in Spanish with no information and expect us to somehow solve it for you.
Found the solution, add 03 F3 0D 0A 00 00 00 00 to the start of that main file and decompile it with uncompyle6. It's a pyc file with the magic number missing.
PyQt4 and 5 should work with the [v7 release](https://github.com/Almenon/AREPL/releases/tag/v1.0.0-alpha.7).
I've gone for 3.6 just for the so called [f-strings](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0498/) which are simply awesome.
hmu i can help u with that
If you have anything in a github/gitlab to show off, you could start freelancing with [upwork](https://www.upwork.com/).
Thanks for this.
Wow thanks for the in-depth answer. I guess I feel more drawn to research but it's way too early to decide yet. Definitely sounds very rewarding. I can't really say I have much else to say but digest what you've said :p thanks again
Why are you trying to serialize classes to a database?
Perhaps, if the intent is to avoid sugar, you should simply continue avoiding sugar?
How do i do that? (sorry i dont use github)
Since I'm not too familiar with JavaScript (and honestly I hate it), I'm trying to implement some ajax features to my WebPoster for Telegram using [Brython](http://brython.info) which translates Python code to JS.
It's not triviality that gives away that this is a homework problem, it's the specificity of the question and mention of details that are extraneous or obvious to the professional, and lack of connection to a real world problem. Or maybe it's that the SQL solution to this is elegant and likely faster than pure Python so you'd need an artificial reason for not being able to use it.
Working on repo where I try to implement popular deep learning methods and algorithms and write exhaustive documentation [here it is](https://github.com/MikhailKravets/Spytnik). As I learn neural networks I know that sometimes it is hard to find practical examples of NNs with eplanations; so, the reason of this is to help people understand deep learning :)

This. Why don't you make some factories that build classes for you and then simply save the data required to build these classes on the fly. 
And eating real sugar instead of fake sugar just means you already ate the sugar instead of just having a craving for it.

Great summary of the mental process, thanks. It is funny to see the differences in tooling between *old* and *modern* ecosystems ([here](https://github.com/rochacbruno/py2rs#environment-tools): Python needs 15 and no one has actually a vision about the direction it should evolve towards, Rust essentially just 1. Extremely tempting just for the sake of life quality. 
you don't really need an IDE for small Python scripts a smart text editor that can do syntax highlight and pep8-compliant indentation will do ps: dat nickname
unfortunately this site seems to be poisoned by CloudFlare
But it’s renamed prod.py.
I'm only happy when I'm bathing in the tears of fired incompetent developers who think that "your pseudo code can be production code in python because the syntax is so simple."
Continue eating fake sure then?
Extremely interested. I've wanted this for a long long time. Could you go more into who "we" are (either here or DM?). Curious to learn about your business/how you ended up in these talks.
ok i get the setting up part but how do i perform stuff like subtraction, multiplication etc on it? cause just doing p = numpy.mgrid[1:10] q = numpy.mgrid[2:10] p-q does not work
Mental illnesses aren't as bad as being fucking dumb and not being able to see sarcasm and taking something on internet seriously. Just like people who downvoted this one, LUL.
Ah cool thank you!
Then each instance still has limited throughput. Event loop based async solutions are the only architecture we currently have that allows you to fully utilize the CPU (assuming you have enough RAM) no matter what your I/O load is. Otherwise you have a lot of workers that are stuck waiting for I/O and unable to accept new connections.
The [cuda](http://numba.pydata.org/numba-doc/0.35.0/cuda/index.html) section of the official docs doesn't mention numpy support and explicitly lists all supported Python features. `@numba.cuda.jit` can't be used on all `@numba.jit`-able functions. You will have to rewrite it without numpy.
It's a joke. No one actually does this. 
Don't need it but it's more convenient
I wonder why my clients pay me so much money to clean up after their developers, then.
Ah I see, thanks! I'll look into this! I have mostly worked with numpy, do you know if there are similar functions to e.g. np.where etc?
Shhhh
Its not a difference since the code looks the exact same if you swap ' for "
Thanks. 
Student from uk, learning python as a hobby. I'd suggest making a discord for this :)
The evolution of my pseudocode in my first CS class was funny. At first it started out as pseudocode that didn't match any language but later on it was just code. This is probably even more true of python as it was for what was java at the time for me. 
I don't know much about numba, but you might be better off using one of the libraries that focus on providing a numpy(-inspired) API for GPU arrays, like [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/tensors.html) (relevant examples [here](http://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/blitz/tensor_tutorial.html#numpy-bridge) or [cupy](https://docs-cupy.chainer.org/en/stable/tutorial/basic.html).
You got it. I'm off to download it now.
Ah sweet! I didn't know that existed, I've only used the original @jit that just compiles before! Thanks! You think that is better than to rewrite it using vanilla python?
I built my own CNN classifier using Tensorflow. I parsed all the stock subreddits and twitter profiles to get a crap ton of comments (like 1.2 mil I think). I then categorized them (what a bitch that was) as to their sentiment, either BUY, SELL, or NEUT. From their it's just simply sticking a fan infront of my computer while it trains. I do have a git but I haven't uploaded my bot yet, it's not quite ready for other's to see. I'll definitely upload it when I feel it is.
It's a joke. Relax.
Just do it™?
Give it 25 years and see how many layers upon layers of workarounds for workarounds have accumulated in typical Rust dev environments :)
That's when 3.0 came out, but some people still refuse to update
TCP/IP? Isn't that what they are referring to?
I don't know, they have different approaches that both have its advantages and disadvantages. I only have experience with PyTorch, and in my experience it works great. It's less "magic" than numba - you explicitly write what and where (CPU or GPU) everything should be executed, while numba takes your Python code, optimizes and transpiles it at runtime, making those decisions for you. Numba can auto-optimize things like for-loops, while in PyTorch you will need to eliminate/vectorize them yourself.
I understand, thank you for the reply :)
Python has some issues, all of which I'd rather endure than static typing.
Have you tried raising exceptions for invalid entries?
Also a way to test how up-to-date your fonts are.
Everything I'm working on now seems boring. Thanks for the link.
LOL we will see :) It is interesting tho that all of the modern languages take into account the tooling as an essential component of the language *as a product*.

Find a project to code and start coding.
This would be really cool just to play with, is there a repo that one could leverage?
This code smells. Apart from all the style issues, that make code slow, ugly and unreadable, you should declare sum=0 in the last function, before accessing it. 
One tip that will go a long ways towards your goal: name things for what they *are*. `index1` is completely devoid of meaning, and as soon as I figure out what `index1` is, its meaning changes on the next line (`index1 = operation(index1)`). Initially calling it something like `positions_of_zeroes` makes things infinitely easier to read (because things will read like a sentence).
You've solved the world's obesity crisis. Good work!
Webscraping data with selenium and beautifulsoup; My train is always too late and I want to make a sheet with the amount of minutes I have waited for my train this school year.
You can put a column as the index.
I'm a long time Python/C++ developer who has been programming in Rust for the last year. The tooling is one of the major selling points to me. This is why I'm such a fan of [copying it in Python](https://github.com/sdispater/poet). Coming from Python, other major selling points - Supports multiple versions of dependencies, avoiding most forms of dependency hell - Easier distribution of programs (no PyInstaller, virtualenvs, etc) - Powerful type system to avoid common types of bugs (don't feel the need to unit test as much) - Language design and *community standardization* allows some powerful things like serde (automatic serialization of structs) On the other hand - Not as powerful for testing (e.g. can't `patch` things) - Slightly slower initial development (made up for in test writing, test maintenance, and general maintenance).
Jupiter notebook and is excellent for learning. 
I also thought the name came from being close to the metal but the wikipedia page says: &gt; &gt; The language grew out of a personal project started in 2006 by Mozilla employee Graydon Hoare,[11] who stated that the project was possibly named after the rust family of fungi.[27] Mozilla began sponsoring the project in 2009[11] and announced it in 2010.[28][29] The same year, work shifted from the initial compiler (written in OCaml) to the self-hosting compiler written in Rust.[30] Known as rustc, it successfully compiled itself in 2011.[31] rustc uses LLVM as its back end. Don't know what to believe.
Just look at hello world in python and Java...
Thanks, I keep smirking my eye on Rust for a long time but haven't had much time (eh... dedication) to actually try to write something in it and finally learn it. I hope that this will push me to finally try it. :)
Sack up, snowflake.
&gt; no one has actually a vision about the direction it should evolve towards That's a bit unfair. Many people have such a vision, and sometimes they even agree. There is progress on improving tools and standards, but evolving a massive existing ecosystem is a slow process.
Seriously, who actually thinks he's being serious? F5 obviously doesn't turn keyboard brightness down. It turns it up. 
Second each point. Anyway, *don't worry, type hints are coming to fix all of that crap* ^s 
I started with Thonny and moved onto Pycharm a little while later. Thonny is nice when you're still not sure what is and isn't important while coding. It can be frustrating when you just want to code but you're trying to get used to an IDE. Of course I now love Pycharm and would never go back!
TIL: run configuration can be committed to the repo. I normally ignore the .idea directory!
It's can be useful when everyone in your command using PyCharm.
I can't believe how wrong you are, it does neither! It simply makes it blink!
Usually referred to as strong/weak types so you can group them along two axes like so: ---- | Strong | Weak :---------|:----------|:---------- Static | Java | C Dynamic | Python | PHP 
Turns out we were both [wrong](https://i.imgur.com/cQX5JK5.jpg). It's actually a worthless media key that doesn't work in any media application I've ever tried it with.
I think I am suffering slightly from it. Part of that is because I came from QA (which is kind of part of the OPS/Production department? - don't ask why), and I was top dog over there. I know all of the devs really well, but I'm now a JDev and feel like I'm going really slow and I'm now at the bottom, which is weird. I'm super excited to learn and dig in, but the frame work (ERPNext) is a little overwhelming. I'm taking it one day at a time and continuously learning. 
Atom user here checking in.
The framework is ERPNext. I'm not allowed to change any of their code at this point, rightfully so since I'm so new. Mainly, however, it's because we want to continue to do pulls without having to merge all of our stuff all the time. So I'm kind of jumping between Python, JS (and ajax), and attempting to work on an unfinished application on my own. No one else here writes Python, and this project is to be my baby. I just have a LONG way to go. 
Why vim specifically? It sounds like you're trying to learn Python and vim at the same time, and not learning either.
Yeah that's true! I'll think about that when rewriting the code:) thx
I really like this idea. I found something called TiddlyWiki which is just an HTML file that you write to that uses a JAR file to do the work in the background. I'm gonna see if I can build on this - but just in case, do you have a personal wiki that you would recommend? 
I'll have to find a local guru :D. Everyone else at work writes in C#. I'm all by my lonesome.
Because i'm already using Vim, i know a little bit about it, and i will work on environment with vim too. 
Then I'd recommend starting with a prebuilt distribution like [SpaceVim](http://spacevim.org/) if you don't want to dig deep.

Jokes on you, I made my own application which utilizes F5!
You are welcome :)
In case you're not being sarcastic, some things that are still missing from python with mypy - moving/ownership. This makes it possible to write state machines in the type system that ensures you didn't accidentally keep a previous state around - borrow checker. You no longer have bugs from accidentally mutating something that is also being used somewhere else - variant/enum with pattern matching - Common vocabulary like Option (instead of None), From (generic form of type coercion), etc that are foundational to a lot the powerful uses to the type system. You can "write rust in python" by reinventing these but its severly hampered when your ecosystem is not built on these.
I mean, it's still getting on your teeth, it's just not going over them. You would have to put the straw half way down your throat to avoid it getting on your teeth because it mixes with your saliva.
This should work, more efficient and way more compact: import numpy as np def sync_vector(x, y): # where return the indexes where the condition is True. # | mean elementwise or, ~ elementwise not indexes = np.where(~(np.isnan(x) | np.isnan(y) | (x == 0) | (y == 0))) # We return the synces x, y and the indexes of not zero or nan values return x[indexes], y[indexes], indexes if __name__=="__main__": x = np.random.randn(100) y = np.random.randn(100) x[[3, 5, 8, 50, 30]] = np.nan y[[87, 30, 5, 12, 41]] = np.nan sync_vector(x, y) sync_vector(x, x) # should work too
You can also use [Brython](http://brython.info) to develop [Android applications](https://github.com/brython-dev/brython/wiki/Writing-an-Android-application)
Haha, good catch! It might also be closer to working VBA (barf) than Python.
There was [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/7e6pes/vim_python_ide/) post recently. Start with this setup. 
Dude that is really nice! I have looked the whole day for a cool solution, I finally came up with this def sync(x,y): index = np.where(np.logical_and(~np.isnan(x), ~np.isnan(y))) index = np.squeeze(index) x = x[index] y = y[index] return x, y, index But I could understand how to work with more than AND. So you can have as many logical statements in np.where as you want?
And as actual python: for entry in array: do_some_stuff()
Yeah, but you have to use &amp; (and), | (or), ~ (not) which refere to bitwise binary operation on python. With numpy, it allows elementwise operation (and that's what you need here).
Holy shit thank you so much. One more questions because I’ve never learned about this: I used a hex editor to add that to the first line of the file, but when I try to use uncompyle6 I get “&lt;class ‘struct.error’&gt;; unpack requires a buffer of 2 bytes” Any ideas? 
Yeah that was confusing because when you write an if-statement you use "and" but with numpy you use "&amp;"?
By the way, you can try using Pandas (for 1D timeseries) or even `xarray` (for multidimensionnal data) that allow smarter indexing and data manipulation. With a `xarray` Dataset for example, this is possible: synced_data = data.where((data.x != 0) &amp; (data.y != 0), drop=True) where x and y can be accessed as attribute or via dict-style api. 
Sure, I work for Netz0.com. We are going to open a lot of ccTLD (country level extensions) next year and that .py could be interesting for Python-related projects, sites, and developers.
That's not the same operation. You can think about the difference between a matrix product and an elementwise multiplication.
I think .idea in git repo fits perfectly in this type of projects.
I'll include it there! thanks
yes! I think the most important issue on Python is Package distribution and all the things around it! 
I just totally forgot Python. Now I happened to chance upon this reddit post. Wondering what is the difference between the Udemy and original website though?
I use neovim completion manager for autocomplete that works with Jedi. Ale for linting which can conform to the PEP8 style guide. I like NCM because it’s less of a headache to set up than YCM and it provides support for most languages so my autocomplete UI and key shortcuts are uniform.
Ah okay, yeah I thought that "&amp;" must be numpy's version of "and"... Thank you for all the help and the conversation. I work with this alone and have no one to talk to really, so reddit and other internet forums are a gift from above. Quite sad tbh.. :p
I welcome the improvements in the venv area. Something so small can be so annoying if you hit enough and dealing with a large number of projects, I do. 
I'm the PyCharm Dev Advocate, and I couldn't agree more. Very happy as a user to have this new UX. Kudos to @extra_short_girfaffes for the massive amount of formal UX testing he did on this.
I followed this blog post a while back, and it's pretty spot on for my needs. https://realpython.com/blog/python/vim-and-python-a-match-made-in-heaven/
thanks, mate.ya, symlinks were the problems and after passing followlinks =True to os.walk it worked fine.
So totally not what you are asking for, but I've found the various machine learning platforms really good for massively parallel calculations. They're good for more than just neural networks or general machine learning. You can also mix numpy and most frameworks which make code porting so trivial. 
Don't hate on static typing. I know Python fans like to hate on it, but it has its place. Python is adding more &amp; more static typing options... 
Me too. When I first noticed my venvs were shared across all projects, I thought I must be misunderstanding how the IDE works. But I was not. And, I was sad.
I like this release a lot. One thing i'd like is better jinja2 support, a lot of projects rely on jinja2 in one way on another.
I really don’t understand the draw to PyCharm. There is no way I’m paying $200/yr for any software. Especially not something where a text editor: vim, emacs, sublime, vs code, etc with a few plugins emulates. 
You may want to give an absolute path here, like C:\documents\myfile.xlsx, and not just the filename. Openpyxl works fine, it's just that it cannot guess where the file you are trying to open is, relative to the current working directory (which is the directory where you started your python interpreter). The traceback (the several lines long error message you pasted) gives you hints on what the error is, usually at the very bottom.
You and me both! I feel the exact same way.
No idea, I used hxd to add the extra bytes. Made a quick video of the whole process. https://gfycat.com/gifs/detail/OrnateSelfishGiantschnauzer 
Haha, well this is exactly what I'm looking for! I have recently dug into GPU acceleration, this was my first take on it. I've read that PyTorch has something like this? Which ML-packages do you use for GPU??
I have tried all of those over 20 years of work and none of them come close to the productivity boost I get from PyCharm and other Jetbrains IDEs. Work how you like, but don't doubt a lot of folks can get more done with it.
There is a community edition, which is both free and Open Source. What's there not to like?
Community edition is free...
A *lot* of plugins. Each of which adds (sometimes significant) maintenance overhead, slows it down, makes it less stable, and isn't laid out in a consistent, user-friendly manner. I'm a student, so Pro is free for me. If I were a dev in a company, that company should be happy to shell out a tiny fraction of my pay to increase my productivity, because PyCharm is far and away the best tool available for python development. If I was tooling around for fun, then sure, I'd probably stick with the free community edition... which is still one of the best python IDEs around.
Damn, scientific mode is absolutely going to be taking spyder's lunch money.
Be super careful with that, the reason it is switched off by default is because you can trap your program in an infinite loop or traversing the same directories until you run out of user allocated memory. 
I'm sorry but I was completely sarcastic. All of those wonderful perks are pure utopia, type hints are nothing more than a ugly hack hammered on top of the language. Don't expect something ground breaking nor widely adopted, imo.
Vim + a Python interpreter open next to it is my setup. I use iPython for its autocompletion and code inspection (anyobject?? in iPython will print at least a docstring, and source code for pure Python imports)
Are they? I thought we just had annotations but that they didnt force any specific types. I haven't kept up with some of the release notes though.
&gt; Not as powerful for testing (e.g. can't patch things) You can't **monkey patching** but it is easy to **mock** https://crates.io/crates/mockers
I've tried pycharm, and every time I touch it, it becomes a resource hog. And by that I mean even when a coworker handed me his laptop pycharm froze, then when he took it back pycharm unfroze. I like pycharm, but it doesn't like me :(
Here's a link to [all of our tickets marked Jinja2](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issues/PY?q=%23Jinja2) -- if you have any that are priorities, go vote for them (click the thumbs-up by voters).
If you are learning python, go with a jupyter notebook. Don't force yourself to learn multiple tools at the same time. You will be wasting days or even weeks learning VIM instead of actually writing code. 
I use Vim + an open Python interpreter; iPython has great autocomplete and code inspection (object?? will output the docstring, type and source code for pure Python imports)
&gt; PyCharm is far and away the best tool available for python development. Which is your opinion. The best tool for Python development is the one you use to be the most productive in. Nothing more. 
https://github.com/jarolrod/vim-python-ide This was posted a few weeks ago, might not have everything you need but its a start.
I recommend Tensorflow although I personally use it, and MXNet. 
Thanks for the kind words. As a note, the planning meeting for the 2018.1 cycle is next week. If there's anything you're really after, go to [our YouTrack](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issues/PY) and vote for them. 2017.3 was planned to be more incremental and refinement, so 2018.1 has some things in it that were pushed back.
I work at an ISP. We use Mattermost for group chats at work, so I have implemented a version of this bot: https://github.com/LPgenerator/mattermost_bot I have added a few plugins I wrote that fetches info from our delivery systems database and prints back into mattermost. Pretty handy and very customizable given that you have the time to write your code. I also use one plugin to generate MPLS configuration between two infra devices. without having to copy/paste from our delivery system. 
Start with Jupyter &amp; ipython to learn python. 
Why? How does it work?
Tried wb = openpyxl.load_workbook('"\\tai-fp-srv01\users\'myreal name here'\Documents\testexcelfile.xlsx"') and got SyntaxError: (unicode error) 'unicodeescape' codec can't decode bytes in position 15-16: truncated \uXXXX escape 
Agreed. Still useful for others who are used to dynamic typing who might not know what is missing with just mypy.
Thank you so much, I honestly cannot thank you enough for your help and that video! :)
Check out 1m08s in [our What's New video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHwh0c8UsW4).
Nope, you can do "proper" static typing with the typing module as per 3.6. Give it a read: https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html
It's true that you pay an indexing cost when first-time opening a project. 2017.3 has some improvements on that and we are working on more substantial ideas. Code analysis is our big thing, and that requires looking at all the code. But we understand that not everybody values it enough for the up-front time taken.
I've used tf with Keras for NNs but could I use this for these things as well??!
&gt; https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html You need to reread that section. Definitely NOT static typing. The interpreter completely ignores the types.
&gt; Work how you like, but don't doubt a lot of folks can get more done with it. I didn't say it was bad. I said I don't understand the draw to it. It's not for me. Am I not allowed to say that? I never said no one should use it.
So... I can be the best jackhammerer in the world with a screwdriver if I just channel my inner Jackie Chan improv skills?
I was aware of efforts with mocking which was why I mentioned monkey patching. Looking at mockers, it seems like its mostly limited to nightly (there are hacks otherwise) and requires the traits to be modified (annoying if the trait is coming from outside your crate), so still not on equal ground with Python.
So... I can be the best jackhammerer in the world with a screwdriver if I just channel my inner Jackie Chan improv skills?
But doesn't include Django, which is a good chunk of my job. Look if it was $90 for a perpetual license, I would have no complaints. I paid $70 for sublime. But **to me** the subscription costs are not worth it.
After I get passed the initial indexing cost it still uses way more resources than on my coworker's computers. I've tried it at home on linux, with the community and pro editions on windows, it just doesn't seem to want to work well, even with a completely clean install. Intellij works fine in my experience, but pycharm in particular just always hits snags. I still recommend pycharm to people, it's a great IDE and does everything most people need, I've just never been able to make it work for me. I've been a long time sublime user, so I'm mostly just using that or using emacs instead these days. They may have fewer features and aren't full-blown IDEs, but they're powerful enough for me and fit my workflow well.
It literally just switches PyCharm into the default matlab/spyder layout.
Not if I don't have money for Pro :p
Thanks man ! Appreciated!
How do you open the "Debug Probe" so you get a Python REPL at the stack location? I know there is a way and I have used it before, but I remember it being mixed with the output.
Here's the [help page](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/using-debug-console.html). Usually what happens is, your debug tool window is too short and this icon gets hidden behind a &gt;&gt;&gt; popup.
FWIW, you get a perpetual fallback license to the version at the time you started your subscription.
Did you ever write any pseudocode when planning a Java program? Congrats, you already know Python. But seriously, /r/learnpython has tons of resources in the sidebar, specifically the [wiki](/r/learnpython/wiki/index) will probably help.
 do_some_stuff_with = lambda x: print(x**2) # FIX THIS!!!!!!! the_array = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21] for each_entry in the_array: do_some_stuff_with(each_entry) 
He did say: &gt;Work how you like You came to a thread that supports Pycharm and made a comment about how you don't think it is worth the price. Did you not expect to recieve replies to your comment or something? Unpopular opinions are fine, but know your audience dude.
For clarification, is that a license for year 1, the first year I purchased? Or for year x, the most recent year? If it's the second, then I'll remove my comment, as you'd get to keep the most recent version you paid for. (note: I still don't like subscription software.)
I didn't expect to attacked for having an opinion. I don't like subscription models. I'm all for a discussion. But less than an hour after I've posted my comments I've been downvoted to double digits. People are downvoting from disagreement, not from the point of discussion.
True. Not proper static typing. I haven't messed with typing and conflated it with mypy since that is the inspiration. My bad. 
I have no experience with keras, but yeah, should be able to. Heck a basic perceptron network is just massive matrices. 
If you bought now, you'd gave a fall back for 2017.3 forever. Hope that helps.
and if I get charged in Nov of 2018, do I keep that version, or the 2017.3 version
Thanks! I'm glad my stuff is helpful to you. :)
Omg i need to look into this, I love tensorflow so this is cool! Thx!
:D
I don't think you should jump on the bandwagon if you don't want to, and I think you have a good point about annual subscriptions. However, the annual subscription cost is only $53, and that is very much worth it to me and other people because of the time we save. I have used other IDEs and I don't like them. People do jump on the Jetbrains bandwagon because they make useful tools. I choose to pay the subscription because I want them to continue to improve it and devs have to eat.
The original website has the book (which you can also get as a print book or ebook). The Udemy course follows the same material as the book, except the book goes into a bit more detail in some places than the course. Also I skipped the image manipulation chapter in the course, so technically the book goes over more stuff.
It's a bit contrived to say the least... You get a perpetual licence for each version X.Y that has been available for at least 12 months during which you were subscribed. When you have a licence for a X.Y version, you also have a licence for all X.Y.Z versions ever released (bugfix versions). Practical examples (source: [this page](https://sales.jetbrains.com/hc/en-gb/articles/207240845-What-is-perpetual-fallback-license-)): * Subscribe while version X.Y is available. Subscribe for less than 12 months: no perpetual licence whatsoever. * Subscribe while version X.Y is available. Subscribe for exactly 12 months or more: you now have a perpetual licence for X.Y. * Subscribe while version X.Y is available. Let's say four months later, version X.Y+1 is released. You can use any of the two versions. Subscribe for exactly 12 months: you have a perpetual licence for X.Y, but not for X.Y+1. If you had switched to X.Y+1, you have to go back to X.Y. * Subscribe while version X.Y is available. Four months later, version X.Y+1 is released. Subscribe for exactly 16 months: you have a perpetual licence for X.Y and for X.Y+1. Also, the subscription price drops down significantly over 3 years: €89, then €71, then €53, which then recurs indefinitely.
For what it's worth, Python will most likely ALWAYS be dynamically typed. However, Python has also introduced [Pep 523](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0523/) which essentially provides support for JITs to utilize things like type annotation to increase performance. This is still in its infancy (at least 5-10 years off), though. Additionally, this PEP can provide ways of interacting with a debugger. Also, mypy is pretty cool with the more recent release of [PyAnnotate](https://github.com/dropbox/pyannotate) which can provide (still a young project) auto-generation of annotations for use with mypy. At some point, the hope is that mypy combined with a JIT will provide some pretty interesting speed bumps. At the moment, though, Python's JITs are immature and are not optimizing in any intelligent way; they generally punt on optimizations within loops. As they mature, you'll see better performance.
You need to escape the \ slashes in your string, otherwise it thinks \t in \tai is tab-ai. Same for all the other slashes: '"\\tai-fp-srv01\\users\\'myreal name here'\\Documents\\testexcelfile.xlsx"' Or you can use a raw string, prefixed with r: r'"\tai-fp-srv01\users\'myreal name here'\Documents\testexcelfile.xlsx"'
You can use a relative file path, but check what your current working directory is with os.getcwd(). Usually it's set to the location of the Python script to begin with. You can change it by calling os.chdir('the new directory'). Or you can specify the full absolute path of the file.
Logged in to check, it only lists 1 fall back version(I've had pro for 2ish years).. So when you sub for another year, sounds like that version is your new fall back.
I'm using DataCamp. Not entirely impressed but it does seem to get easier the more I memorize the quirks and commands. How did codeacademy work for you?
So if I've subbed when v2 was out, and v3 comes out a month later, if cancel I go back to v2? Losing out on all the features I'd been using for 11 months? Yep, I'm still against this. You should get the version you were currently using
This is a lot of effort for not a lot of gain. class A: pass a = A() def foo(): print("Hello, World!") A.foo = staticmethod(foo) a.foo() &gt;&gt;&gt; "Hello, World!" If you're writing static methods use the static method decorator when you attach it to the class.
I liked it. Good place to start when you don't know jack about programming. The only thing I didn't like is when you went back to redo an exercise the finished code is still there from the time you did it before.

And flask support is lacking compared to Django :(
As a full time full stack dev paying for the all products jetbrains package. I cannot assert how much of a productivity boost the jetbrains ecosystem provides. I use all their products except phpstorm and rubymine. If you can get work done without it good for you but I make enough money that the productivity boost I get from jetbrains is more than satisfactory for the price I pay.
Who is jack? Lol I’ll give it a shot. It couldn’t be much worse than data amp. Thanks!
If it wasn't a subscription model, and was instead just the old "pay for the current version" model, then you wouldn't get v3 in that scenario anyway - you'd still end up with just v2.
SSD's are a game changer try em.
You use a screwdriver? Screw you, the real pros use their foreheads for maximum productivity. 
I don't know of a single app that releases a major upgrade that won't grandfather you in for at least the past 3 months. Usually 6 months.
In my work laptop I have one, along with some beefy hardware. As I've said many times before, I like pycharm, but every time I try to use it, it seems to choke. Other people don't have the problems I do. My coworker who is a big jetbrains fan can't figure out what's wrong and thinks I'm just haunted. Intellij doesn't have issues. Pycharm is the only jetbrains product I've had issues with, and I wish it weren't the case. 
Ask in /r/learnpython This is not an appropriate place to ask for homework help
That sucks man, try reinstalling pycharm and also try to get the java jdk that jetbrains provides when installing pycharm again. And use the 64bit version. 
I don't think that the Spyder devs have much lunch money to give..
Has anyone experience to share moving from Emacs to PyCharm? I've been considering trying PyCharm to understand what IDE components exactly that Emacs does not provide either at all or sufficiently. I'm too far integrated into Emacs to ever switch off - rather I'd like to bring some of the lessons PyCharm has to offer to the other side.
I noticed in one of the last few updates it auto loads your venv when you open the terminal now. Love that little addition!
When you set up a venv...it's an option "make venv available to all projects"
Okay, now every thing is clear thanks a lot
[Automate the Boring Stuff with Python] (http://buklijas.info/blog/2017/02/01/automate-the-boring-stuff-with-python-book-review/) is the best book for beginners. I recommend it to everybody.
One google search later: [Freelance sites](https://dynomapper.com/blog/266-top-25-freelance-websites-to-find-work-in-2017)
Have you looked at this? https://developers.arcgis.com/python/
I am new to it, but I believe it is super easy. You go over to github, register, and your registration is free for public and open profiles. You then create a "repository", drag and drop your python script into the 'file upload' section. Then post that link to wherever, like here. Then people can access the file. This is the 10,000 feet up view of it. It could be a little more specific or what not, but it's pretty simple. edit: after you have uploaded the python file, the url of that current page, is the link you will share on a place like reddit or in this thread. 
You don't need vim to be compiled with python to work with python. Press `i` and code. Focus on learning Python if that is what you want. As time goes on you will see what is lacking on your working flow and you can go for it, learn a bit more of vim to make it better. Remember to go through the vimtutor you should be fine. Vim outofbox offers a lot to help you with python... open a python script and press `}` or `{`, go to insert mode and press `CTRL-n` or `CTRL-P`... focus on learning python, pick another editor if you want a "cool IDE as soon as possible". Good lucky anyway
It's really nifty for application development as your projects get larger. There's really good autocompletion and code linting that makes it a lot easier.
Yep. [Anaconda just dropped Spyder sponsorship]( https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/spyderlib/kZk_VJhCsd4) 9 days ago: 
If you don't feel the need to learn Python, why are you using Python? The /r/learnpython board is for questions about it, while /r/python is more for Python news/tips. Regardless of the language, 1000 lines of code is not a debuggable amount. Make a copy of the code and delete as many lines as you can (remove function calls then the functions, only have one `else`, print only what you need, etc.) such that you keep getting the same bug. That approaches the so-called "short, self-contained, correct/compilable example" (SSCCE).
paging /u/george3d6
$90/year is pretty cheap as licenses go.
&gt; Losing out on all the features I'd been using for 11 months? Correct. You would need to pay one more month (approximately €9) to keep v3.
No, I don't fell it's a project worth. It's a personal thing, much like an email/message response toll, it's not complex enough to be worth analyzing and not useful enough to anyone else to be worth packaging. If you want a sort of "basic tutorial" for trading bots with python what I could recommend is this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlV_QO5B2eU (as an intro at least, and then playing around with qunatopian). Or if you are specifically interested in scripts that work with IG API's take a look at the samples + code here: https://github.com/ig-python/ig-markets-api-python-library (Or just at the samples if you are planning to use the library)
Is your code shareable?
Thank you ! Sorry I didnt know where to post but thanks man
Thanks, looking forward to seeing the git. In the meantime, feel free to share any resources you considered especially helpful ;)
I moved because things kept breaking and I didn't want to fiddle with 100 variables. PyCharm provided good defaults out of the box (at expense of some resource usage... EightHundred megabytes and constantly swapping). Extensive real time indication of code issues, great refactoring and jumping around, autocompletion (based on type hints or types it derives), VCS integration is what's great. Debugger with breakpoints is good to but I seldom use it. It's great that it can (via pydev) attach to processes running outside. Database integration is great too -- if I type cursor.execute("SELECT ...") PYcharm is going to tell me if I'm accessing bad fields or if my SQL is bad. Since JB released CLion I've started using that for C/C++ code within the project too and upgraded to their complete license. So I think good looking, good defaults out of the box are the most important to me which are kind of at odds with the configurable kitchen sink of emacs. 
In Rust, a crate is the compilation unit and a crate is exactly the unit of thing that is provided by crates.io. So if a distribution is something that contain multiple packages, then Rust's ecosystem has no analog. On the other hand, "compilation unit" isn't really a well defined concept on the Python end of things, so it might be hard to draw direct analogies here.
You can use projects like [Enforce](https://github.com/RussBaz/enforce) - that will enforce the annotations at runtime. There's a performance cost, and it isn't perfect. But I've used it in production successfully.
If anybody is interested I recently became a member of a Python study group on Slack. The group is quite active and I can send an invitation to anybody who sends me their email (in a private message ofc.)
Anaconda is annoying anyway. My experience from using it was that the conda installer is insanely slow, it lacks packages or is bad at keeping packages up to date, and it doesn't play very well with other python package managers (which you'll end up using anyway). It was a nice tool for a beginner though. How is it nowadays? 
Awesome, pep523 will be my reading material tonight. Thanks. I like that python is dynamic, but adding static magic to it offers some pretty insane speed up potential. That and jit etc could offer some awesome speed improvements whilst maintaining cross platform compatability and remaining dynamic when you want dynamic.
(https://github.com/ya-mouse/openopc) maybe
I'm just quoting the guy who said &gt; The only **difference** is 
You're right about that. Flask improvements were in line for 2017.3 but resources went into other refinements. Certainly on the list for 2018.1. Here's the [YouTrack list of Flask tickets](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issues/PY?q=%23Flask). Obviously the CLI is a big one. What else are big for you? (And please go vote for tickets that you'd like emphasized.)
Codecademy was one of the resources I used when I first learned: Absolutely the worst of the lot. It's great for getting a quick syntax overview, but nothing sticks if you don't immediately go build something else with it, and it doesn't give you enough context to do that.
Doesn't include much CUDA stuff, but this video is still a very good intro to Numba particularly for its newer features. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AwG0T4gaO0
Sorry, but can someone explain what does this do ? :/ (thanks in advance)
!Remindme 30 days
I made the switch from a pretty heavily extended Emacs setup. More mouse than I'd like, but not going back.
Anaconda is in my first 3 installs when I get a new computer. * I do mostly scientific computing so it already has most of the packages I need. * Any packages it doesn't have can be easily downloaded and managed with either conda or pip. * Package updates usually happen within a week of the original package release. * I've never had a speed problem, but have also never run into a use case where that was something I was considering. My only complaint is the size, and there's miniconda if it ever really became an issue.
conda install scikit-learn
you mentioned, you'd used it for your job. how long do you have to work to earn one year worth of pycharm? how much did your computer cost? you phone? divide that by the years you use them... is it less than 90$? is 90$ even worth mentioning for a tool for you job?
How long do I have to work for a coffee, a car, a meal at a good restaurant? It all adds up. 
Run it with the cookiecutter library and it will stand up a prebuilt django project for you. The repo (as is) is just scaffolding.
Good luck for this! We are few in my lab using python for that kind of work, so I had to learn by myself. Do not hesitate to ask if you have other questions! 
The easiest way I can think of is something like this. import time for x in range(5): print(x) sleep(1) This will print x, wait 1 second, then print x again. Sleep basically makes the program wait a specific amount of seconds before moving on, so you can utilize this at the end of a loop clause. 
it shows all packages already installed
Yeah that's not just their python course, that's every course on codecademy. It's garbage.
This is a shot in the dark but I have seen issues similar to this with some anti-virus seeing the running kernels as threats and killing them. There was even a while that Symantec End Point protection would quarantine any running notebooks and a good chunk of the virtual environment associated with it. 
No online interactive course will really teach you that well. It helps as a starter if you are going to immediately and continually dive into programming. That being said, codeacademy is much better than most ones I've tried because it is focused on fundamentals. Compare that to datacamp or udemy courses where it is "build deep learning models" and you are literally just retyping module imports and adding one liners for code that the user will not even understand, I have found it more effective. 
This is good question. It scaffolds a project structure. But if it is not clear from the docs, we must improve it! Thank you.
between Java and Python, gladly. Now if it were C or Rust, then you'd have an argument
Here is the list of Vi/NVim plugins that I use now: - supertab: Tab instead of Ctrl+N autocompletion - nerdcommenter: Commenting - vim-plug: (N)Vim Plugin Manger - vim-airline: Cool, but lightweight status bar - syntastic: Linter interface (flake8, pycodestyle,) - nerdtree: Browse files - vim-pydocstring: Docstring templates - vim-colors-solarized: Just the colorscheme I prefer To all Vim naysayers, does this convince why OP's need is justified?
I also mostly do scientific computing. It's been a while since I just moved over to using virtualenv and pip, sometimes with Docker, so I dunno if my problems are inherent from conda or caused by something in my setup. 
To my knowledge and experience, there really isn't one easily indexed and searchable geospatial database available, most are regional(or on state level) and require interacting with them on their own sites or downloading chunks of it. you could try to use QGIS with this to script some data analysis. My only other thought would be to use googlemaps/earth API to pull these. They return JSON objects for coordinates but unsure if there is elevation in there.
For books I'd maybe recommend Automate the boring stuff with Python or Python Crash Course.
Does it have the single kernel where all scripts are executed in like matlab/spyder or is it like regular pycharm with each script in its own process?
I did something a bit like that a while ago, [check it out](https://github.com/michaelcukier/autoquote)
Could you describe more hooking to the ECG. You can use the audio output and play it relatively easy. If you need to hook more ECG inputs you need to use gpio ports. If this needs to be done in parallel /several raspberry gpio hooked to ECG/ you need more advanced approach in terms of software development. In general you need to playback or generate -&gt; modify -&gt; output in parralel. You need to have a test setup. Some device ( orher rasspberry maybe) in order to test, debug or record the output from the simulator. I will be happy to help, because I'm involved in R&amp;D in medical field too.
What would be your ideal online learning experience for Python?
What was the last version of anaconda you used?
Are you saying udemy is good or bad? I lost what you were trying to say in your last sentence. Just curious because I bought a couple of their courses on sale
Reading the language primer on python.org
well udemy is a crap shoot because its like youtube, e.g. people create their own classes, it's not like coursera or edX with an actual institution. Their most popular courses, especially for python and machine learning, don't teach you any theory at all and just show you how to load a simple data set into a predefined model. That being said you can still find good fundamental courses on data structures on algorithms and other topics. 
You don't mention what version of Windows or what bit width. The last time I used py2exe that was all relevant. Did something change? 
the website isnt related at all to http://www.py2exe.org/
Anaconda is ok on windows. A lot of stuff in pypi is hard to use on windows, but the situation is improving.
I'm not sure, but I think last I used it was around the second half of 2016. I used the installed environment after that, but I gave up on anaconda itself. My computers back then weren't really fast, so that might have been a factor.
You called it py2exe but [you use pyinstaller](https://github.com/michaelcukier/py2exe.net/blob/master/__init__.py#L72)?? Anyway, same issue. Last time I used pyinstaller you could not use an exe made on a 64-bit machine on a 32-bit machine. And you can't use a exe made on Windows 10 on Windows 8. Did something change? If not you should make a note what versions of Windows this works with.

_you_ need to escape the escapes to the slashes C:\\\\somewhere\\\\something\\\\this.xlsx
When you're stressed (maybe because you think it will break), you tend to work differently, not waiting for things, hitting things you wouldn't normally, whatever. This disrupts the IDE, which increases your stress level, and a feedback loop arises. Or to put it less technically: "the computer can tell when you're stressed, and will respond in kind, just like a human would"
I guess with Reddit formatting it's easier than writing def function()

Udacity is good, but I think it's Python 2
They mean in previous versions, when creating a venv would make it visible to all projects.
I would curse this if I used this project then get prompts about git after making changes. Please don't do this :(
On the other hand, you could also make it more complicated (and cooler) with metaclasses: class FooAdder(type): def __new__(mcs, name, bases, attr, **kwargs): definition = super().__new__(mcs, name, bases, attr, **kwargs) def foo(): print("Hello, world!") definition.foo = staticmethod(foo) return definition class A(metaclass=FooAdder): pass def main(): a = A() a.foo() if __name__ == '__main__': main() [This](https://blog.ionelmc.ro/2015/02/09/understanding-python-metaclasses/) is a really really great article about metaclasses for anyone wanting to learn more.
I use both. PyCharm "understands" Python much better, has better navigation, and the generative/refactoring support is better and Rope, plus it just works out of the box for large-ish projects. On the other hand, magit. And Emacs has larger breadth and is much lighter for smaller projects or one-off/single-file programs.
It's really good for packaging projects and things that aren't actually Python. You can use it as a package manager for other projects (say, download a whole bunch of [precompiled bioinformatics](https://bioconda.github.io/) tools), so then all someone has to do is run the appropriate `conda` command to recreate your entire environment with like Python, R, and a bunch of other stuff. (Kind of a niche use though, I'll admit...)
Thanks for your feedback! The final .exe file works on Windows 10 (64-bit). I haven't tested yet on other Windows versions. I know the naming may be a bit confusing, but if you haven't looked into the subject, py2exe just means py2exe
&gt; py2exe just means py2exe No, I very much disagree. To anyone with python experience, py2exe means specifically the program published at http://www.py2exe.org/ 
This is going to sound like a very silly request, but could you bring up adding better support for color schemes? I really like having all of my editors share the same color scheme (makes me feel a little more "at home" while coding). Having an easier way of editing/creating color schemes would be very welcome. Alternatively, just bundling a few popular color schemes like [Gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox), [Monokai](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=monokai&amp;t=ffab&amp;iax=images&amp;ia=images), and [Solarized](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=solarized&amp;t=ffab&amp;iar=images&amp;iax=images&amp;ia=images) would be super awesome as well.
Mostly because they've had the opportunity to learn. On the other hand, 25 years from now who knows what things will be considered "essential" and will be provided from the start with new languages but built as piles of hacks in Rust? In the early 90s Python was conceived as a teaching tool and a Unix scripting language. Is it any wonder that it didn't start out with top-tier packaging tools? And even the things in the table right now may face that fate. For example, all it takes is a few people stumbling over creating a particularly complex Cargo.toml file, or the options for it getting a bit more complex, and there'll be a tool spreading around to simplify and automate creation of the file. That's what happened with Python, and certainly can happen with Rust.
m'lady
i like the format. sounds like you guys are disappointed it didn't make you an expert with pandas, or ready to contribute to open source repos. that's not at all the level it's trying to take you. it has the lowest barrier to entry of any programming tutorial i've seen. it's a fantastic starting point imo. after you spend the few hours the course takes, sure go find something that will take you further, like ATBS.
I use Nano
I don't have that problem across 3 different operating systems, and 8 different devices I've used it on
They've definitely been on a steady decline over the years since their premium features came out. Used to be all free and a lot more intuitive to use
First and foremost, this really belongs on /r/learnpython But anyway, you need to tell us more. What system are you using? How did you install sklearn and numpy? Are you using conda? When say you cannot import them, what happens? Basically, all your post says is "I have a problem" without *any* of the information needed to try to trouble shoot.
Great! PyPI needs some staff.
It's not that silly, we talked about it last week. We feel that it would be like the Python standard library, where "things go to die". It might be better for innovation if we let those things evolve outside of our control.
Had to downgrade back to the last edition. Was getting out of memory errors Everytime I indexed or searched. Even set my memory to 2500mb. Last version 1024 was fine.
Use [Xarray](http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/) to read and plot eg [this elevation data](http://research.jisao.washington.edu/data_sets/elevation/). Entire example code: import xarray as xr %matplotlib inline ds = xr.open_dataset('~/Desktop/elev.0.25-deg.nc') ds.data.isel(time=0).plot.imshow() # or just map Australia ds.data.isel(time=0)\ .sel(lon=slice(112, 155), lat=slice(-10, -45))\ .plot.imshow(vmin=0, robust=True) Super easy :-)
Codacademy if brilliant is a first introduction to syntax and types. &gt; All in all it's just a shallow learning experience. Correct. All your complaints but one are that it doesn't go deep enough. But that isn't what it is for. You're complaining that a toddler's pool isn't deep enough to teach them how to dive! &gt; Yes it's a good introduction and it is fun, but it's not enough for me. I am sick of this millennial social tic of trashing something that's not meant for them for not being meant for them.
:( Worst case scenario, can you guys bundle in some new color schemes using the existing tooling? The IntelliJ is a little too bright, and Darcula is very gray and low contrast. Some new colors would be awesome!
Thank you!:)
Al, what software did you use to make your videos for this course?
I use forward slashes for all my path string literals; Windows and/or Python happily translates them to backslashes when accessing the file system.
&gt; Mostly because they've had the opportunity to learn. Sure. 25 years are definitely a good amount of time to learn new things, otherwise I would be worried. &gt; with commenters like you making fun of it? As a Python developer I have to face myself those shortcomings every day (and produce my own pile of hacks to have everything up and running). That's why I feel like I have the right to have some fun on the internet. My apologies if I have cursed the gods.
I really like the new features in this release, however I really hate the fact that, with every new release new bugs appear for things that worked fine in previous releases. I really would take a working PyCharm with less features compared to a featured buggy Pycharm every time. Case in point: Out of nowhere, while docker-compose worked fine in PYcharm 2017.2, in 2017.3 i[t does not start the containers correctly](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/PY-27207) making the docker-compose integration more or less useless. I would really appreciate some feedback from the Jetbrains team on this.
Metaclasses are a lot of fun, you can end up reaching the edges of pythons class system once you start using them.
No, handwritten recognition is not a solved problem yet, it is beginning to be offered by companies but with expensive prices and not sure about the accuracy one gets. Typed or printed text is easier, Google vision api is probably the simpler solution. For open source go with tesseract. 
I used Camtasia to record and edit it. Helpful hint: If you go to their site and put it in your shopping cart but then wait a few days, they'll email you a small discount code for it.
Completely agree with you. It does what it intends to do, giving you the basics to use other sites and tools (and freeing you to spend time setting things up). 
That's some nice stuff. I really like the new data science mode.
Looks cool, thanks for the pointer! It still looks a bit unpolished, but it's nice to see PyCharm going in that direction. The only issue I see is that this is only available in the paid version.
Spyder can also evaluate each file in its own console.
Can you describe your emacs setup for python? 
You mean start up another program with python? Use the `subprocess` module. --- If you have more questions like this it's better to post them on /r/learnpython. Be sure to [format your code for reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/faq#wiki_how_do_i_format_code.3F) or use a site like pastebin. Also, include which version of python and what OS you are using. 
I loved it. Gets you the basics, no frills. In learning software, you're going to read a lot of stuff that you already know or doesn't go into enough detail. It's just collecting one little nugget that you didn't know before, and doing that thousands of times.
As the developer of IRkernel: yes, anaconda creates more problems than it solves. You'll have so many library version mismatches and other shit, it's just not worth bothering and subscribing to all the pain.
Because they will be pushing jupyterlab...
The move is towards jupyterlab though. 
"Rust type inference is inspired by Python and Ruby". No, its inspired from ML.
Nothing's moving towards jupyterlab yet. &gt; This is a very early preview, and is not suitable for general usage yet. It's not even mentioned in most scientific computing IDE discussions - they're normally between spyder, thonny, sometimes rodeo, the usual spunking over things which aren't actually IDEs, and pycharm.
It's for plotting networks. If you use network analysis when deciding on your stocks, then maybe, otherwise I wouldn't know how. 
thanks fixed it
Can I recommend you check out my online course, "Python Jumpstart by Building 10 Apps"? https://training.talkpython.fm I built it to address many of the frustrations you are having and it's Python 3 too.
Why does it capture matplotlib plots? I lose the controls for panning and zooming: https://puu.sh/yweKY/253a696ad2.png
Being able to interactively debug a python application running on a remote server is pretty damn useful.
Is this something that is a one-off or does it need to automatically do this and the analysis over and over?
Over and over. It's a link between a legacy system and a 3rd party API. The legacy system will continuously produce new records that must be transmitted. Sometimes just one record, sometimes thousands.
How frequently does it produce new records? Are there rate limits on the API?
Manually. So the user of the legacy system might update just one record or do a batch update that includes years worth of records. There is a rate limit, can't remember off the top of my head but I can easily code around it. The bigger issue is the size limit the API will accept. If the JSON is bigger than x amount, it fails. So currently, I'm just breaking up the data into smaller groups, waiting a second or two and transmitting the next bit. It works... Just bugs me that I can't find a neater solution. 
No I haven't but this looks cool. Is it paid or a free service ? 
I've been doing a lot of web dev lately, so I'm very happy with these changes. Gonna make writing that API way easier now. 
Xarray was what I planned on using :) I want to make some 3d graphs. Is plotly the best resource for doing topology plots in python? 
And the new system should reflect the old system as quickly as possible. gotcha. Just to clarify, when grouping data together for the API, you can use a range of dates (i.e. 1/1/17-1/7/17) and you can use days of the week? (i.e. MTW) 
Correct on all accounts.
ah okay. Yeah I wasn't sure about the quality but I figured I'd give it a shot for 10 bucks haha. I got the Data analysis with Numpy/Pandas one and another one on full stack web development with Django so we will see how those go
 raw = """1/1/17,a,a 1/2/17,a,a 1/3/17,b,a 1/4/17,a,a""" def add_entry(lst, begin, end, marker): entry = f"{begin},{marker}" if begin == end else f"{begin}-{end},{marker}" lst.append(entry) output = [] begin_date = end_date = current_marker = None for line in raw.split(): date, marker = line.split(',', 1) if marker != current_marker: if current_marker is not None: add_entry(output, begin_date, end_date, current_marker) begin_date = end_date = date current_marker = marker else: end_date = date add_entry(output, begin_date, end_date, current_marker) #### print(output)
Awesome! I didn't know I wanted an http client in IDE but now I'm wondering how I ever lived without it! This is why I'll always support Jetbrains. Really looking forward to playing with this!
No idea, I haven't done much 3D plotting - I tend to make grids of 2D images when my data goes high-dimensional (usually band/time/y/x images).
Paid - for a free alternative check out QGIS, or in pure Python libraries rasterio + fiona or shapely usually works :-)
I require a greater degree of gratitude, look you failed at utilizing words for that task, so let's not waste any more trying that mistake again, express the gratitude the world owes me monetarily... Yes, that should do it. BRB need cookies and sugar-free Red Bull.
I prefer textbooks and then working on real life projects with data I use at my job. I found that after completing 4 courses on datacamp, I knew very little and had no idea what to type when I started a project from scratch. Textbooks can be tedious but have helped me a ton and I often refer to sections Ive covered when working on projects. Also, youre typing everything out...not filling in the blanks like with an online site. I was a Textbook zombie for 4 months (95% textbooks for 4 months), then started slowly balancing it out. Now Im more like 40% textbook, 60% live projects. But I intend to get deep into plenty more textbooks in the near future. Google (stackoverflow usually) and textbooks are my best friends for coding.
Do you fucking work for code academy or something
$89 the first year, $71 the second year, $53 the third year onwards.
nah bro i reddit for free
Delphi. You're not even allowed to buy it without a subscription anymore. So for the lower SKU that's $1000 + $400 subscription fee upfront. You **don't even get bugfixes** without having a current subscription! And if you want bug fixes for releases older than current, you need the "platinum" subscription, which is almost double the price. I find it amusing as a former Delphi developer I felt the costs were obscene compared to Python, and you're here complaining about a one-time $90 charge. To even come close to replicating the standard data analysis stack of Python (Python, PyCharm, Pandas, SQLAlchemy, Numpy, SciPy, MatPlotLib, Scikit-learn, etc.) would cost almost $6000 with Delphi, vs. $89 with Python (as an individual). Matlab costs about $2100 plus most libraries cost $1000 apiece. 
Almost ready to drop the CLI for venv and pip work, and use it within PyCharm, but it looks like installing missing modules doesn't use the proxy settings I've got set, so I still need to drop into a command prompt to pip install via proxy. Any chance this could be looked at?
Pycharms probably the most on point editor for any language I’ve ever used. Second place is C# in visual studio, say what you want, but that’s an pretty wonderful dev experience. 
Sounds like they need better unit testing.
Anaconda would be roughly a million times better if they were just a killer multi platform pip and virtualenv setup. They almost are, but all this condaenv and conda stuff is little more than an annoying complication. 
What is missing? 
Eclipse CDT is still way better than CLION though it’s getting better. While no one was looking their indexer turned into the fastest most accurate thing on the block. I have both on my box right now and eclipse keeps winning. 
It’s way better on almost every feature point. It’s never going to open as fast as vim, but neither will emacs. It just does everything you need to develop fast, and does it without having to fuck around near as much as you have to with emacs. Everyone else does little more than color the code, so they aren’t even in the race really. 
Nah man. It’s clearly better in almost every measurable metric. It has a list of features most editors don’t even try to duplicate. There’s really no comparison. 
Yeah man. It’s dirt cheap. It’s like they’ve never seen a 100k eda tool license. I’m think my yearly right now is like 250k in tools alone. Honestly $100 is a joke. I just paid it and forgot about it. It’s trivial. 
I just wish they'd make the ipython console as functional as the standard terminal version of ipython. 
You should use a real IDE like Google Translate.
Pytest can do it. See the last example in this subsection of the docs: https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/assert.html#assertions-about-expected-exceptions
You can't use vectorization in the same way as on CPU: http://numba.pydata.org/numba-doc/0.35.0/cuda/kernels.html What you should be doing for GPU calcs is specifying something like: Gdim = 20 # Thread-blocks per grid Bdim = 64 # Threads per block The exact numbers depend on the GPU architecture you are using. Then call your `@cuda.jit` decorated functions as: numba_cuda_func[Gdim,Bdim]( arg ) Also be aware that for simple calculations the CPU may be faster due to various overhead issues with GPUs. E.g.: http://www.entropyreduction.al/python/numexpr/2017/10/16/accel-phase-corr.html I would try CPython `&lt;&gt; if &lt;conditional&gt; else &lt;&gt;` in-place of your `where` calls as a ternary replacement, but I don't know if the Numba folks have implemented it.
Ok, so whats in then? :P
You can lie with code, just like statistics
Django from the box supports project and application templates, cookiecutter not needed! 
There is probably an extra `,` in the heading, assuming that it's the separator of the *CSV* file.
not things you want to develop in, trust me. Unless you're the sort of person who honestly believes that using shitty 80s-throwback text editors instead of purpose built IDEs somehow proves they're a "real" programmer (or the sort of person childish enough to care about that sort of thing in the first place.)
yeah that's why. I just parsed it out. thanks
lol why the fuck would you recommend Vim or Emacs as a "very beginner friendly" IDE? You do realize it's far, far, far more likely that they're using Windows (or perhaps Mac OSX?) than Linux, right?
Common network share with venv or compiled executables for them to use in place.
Why not create more specific errors and raise those instead?
I would just put your scripts in a git repository and maybe write a how-to for people to pull updates and run scripts from their own machines. If you put a web front-end up there, then you’re hiding the magic from them. Plus it would allow them to contribute changes back that others can take advantage of. Depending on what kind of tasks you’re planning to automate, ansible might be a good candidate rather than home-grown scripts. It will also improve traceability and repeatability, especially if you store your playbooks in a git repository.
I love python, and I enjoy coding very much. So far I have made a really nice, sophisticated python bot called [Clarissa](https://github.com/Clarissa-Bot/Clarissa3.git). I can't really say I'm the second best python developer I know (second to my girlfriend). Feel free to email me @ bremo.lincolin101@gmail.com for interest or if you want to buy Clarissa.
Can you give us a bit more of an overview of what this does beyond get custom data
Not a Dev, but I guess you could try changing the matplotlib backend and see if that helps.
It's a work in progress but the idea is to bring IBM's Watson-like bot to the general consumer. And no, Google Assistant and Siri do not count, as those are just Q&amp;A bots, and use hardcoded input, no machine learning. This is actually what I want to add on to it next: supervised machine learning. Good thing is I love coding &amp; learning code, bad thing is my college has a lack of software classes :'(
If you have any ideas on what to add on, feel free to PM me or clone the code and add it on. After all, this is a community project. Just be warned: I keep several backups of the source code, I can easily remove malicious code.
Sweet! Thanks:)
I found the option in `Settings -&gt; Tools -&gt; Python Scientific` and clicking the checkbox.
Actually you need tmux.
During the EAP releases, didn't JetBrains advertise that the scientific mode would be included in the community edition? Unless I am mistaken about that, this is quite disappointing TBH. 
I prefer vscode. Jetbrains IDEs are bloated and buggy.
No need to guess - test it out! I already tested it with pandas and a neural net and it seemed fine ~ but I would love to make it even faster! As for the preview being bloated with data, it has a depth limit so anything deeper than [1,2] (ex: nested arrays [[]]) are collapsed by default.
lol
I’m working on my first ever Python project, a MATE applet for i3 (GUI environment for Linux) https://github.com/city41/mate-i3-applet
I use single quotes for strings that semantically represent something similar to keys and double quotes for strings that are semantically just text. So for example, string keys in a dictionary would have single quotes as well as keyword input arguments to a function but error messages or user output would have double strings. That way it's very simple to distinguish at a glance between "important" strings denoted by single quotes and "unimportant" strings denoted by double quotes.
And you can lie by [fucking lying too](https://tamino.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/warmcool.jpg).
Years ago TiddlyWiki scared me away. The idea behind it is great, but for best experience you have to be familiar with JavaScript (I wasn't at that time). I use the vimwiki plugin just because vim happens to be my text editor of choice. But there are really lots of wiki options. If I wasn't using vimwiki, I'd probably be using [fossil](https://fossil-scm.org) - it is a version control tool, like git, but with many bundled goodies: among them are the integrated ticket system and wiki (those are versioned as well) and a web GUI. A fossil binary is a single file that can be carried on a flash stick, or downloaded in a second. A fossil repository is just a single SQLite database file (fossil was created by the author of SQLite).
Hi I am interested.. PM me the details... 
&gt; Just be warned: I keep several backups of the source code, I can easily remove malicious code. Do people try such dirty tricks for real?
I'm trying to run it for first time and when type "python3 setup.py pwd" it shows me KeyError: 'USERPROFILE'
Although already solved, one can use the parameter "usecols" to select the columns to be loaded. Usecols accepts a dict with names or index numbers (0-indexed).
Are you able to post the last say 50 lines of command line output when the kernel is stopped? I guess there should be some lines that include error statements. 
I love Pycharm for local work but for some reason or other I just couldn't get it set up for working remotely. I've used the FTP plugin for Notepad++ for a rather clunky solution and more recently Wing, which is much better. What am I doing wrong in Pycharm? I've usually got an SSH session open to the server so it literally just needs to be development and nothing else.
Does Clion have multi step macro expansion? When i was doing c that was a lifesaver
The free as in beer and open source version has most of the features besides Web stuff, dB stuff, code coverage, and python debug over ssh
&gt; To all Vim naysayers, is OP's need justified now? Thanks god, someone kindly. I will take a look on yours plugings. Thx mate.
Thanks :)
Thanks :)
Too mouse oriented? Have you looked at the key mappings? Just about everything you can do can be assigned or has already been assigned to a keyboard shortcut and for shortcuts you don't remember and everything else, Ctrl-shift-a
The main selling points for me that differentiate it from editors are: 1. Navigation: Jump to definition, find usages, automatic forward/backward navigation to precious cursor point, Bookmarking, 2. Refactoring: renaming variables, classes, etc. Extracting variables, methods/functions. Moving things to different files/packages/namespaces. Promoting/moving class properties up or down the inheritance chain. There's more, but all of these things modify all references and usages accordingly 3. Inspection. View objection structure as you navigate Fuck. My plane is leaving. I can't wrote more in depth, but remote debugging id's also a killer feature. Svn integration adds features to hit that got doesn't have. I'll write more later
Watson isn't even a real product, so much as a collection of services IBM sales under a brand label. Also the claim that people have never combined python bots and machine learning is ludicrous. I wish you luck on your project, and happy to see you're interested in the ML space, but you're riding the hype-train a little much.
Something that I really like in pycharm is its fuzzy auto complete. I couldn't get that working in emacs.
Trump's answer will be https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRsPheErBj8
Just like al gore and the climate scientists' that wanted to edit out the medieval warming period from the historical data. 
You could try mounting the remote with **sshfs**, then you can work with it as if it was your own machine. When you are done, unmount it with **fusermount -u**
I hope 1$ will go to markdown support… it is not funny, that pypi does not support it.
Choose the right tool for the right job, the right resource for the right level of learning. A lot of the issues about Codeacademy are simply based on this millennial sickness where people want to learn something for 2 days and then start building the next Facebook or launch the next unicorn. When they discover that it doesn't work that way, they blame the resource.
You might want to look into Python Anywhere as they make Python hosting very convenient and I think you could host a Jupyter notebook there to act as a front end.
Irony being that ons of PyCharm's most vaunted features it's testing integration... 
This might be late but I started off with the codeacademy course, even though it was python 2, it was great because there were so many exercises, practice makes perfect. I've just finished an intro to python from coursera (Python Programming: A Concise Introduction Wesleyan University) with worked with python 3 (and spyder) and I didn't have any trouble adjusting. I'll probably move on to the datacamp course now, which is more data science focused. Basically, whatever works best for you.
It supports rst which is close enough and widely used in Python.
If you dig into the code base a bit you'll find an implementation for markdown that's been buried. But definitely sad that Markdown isn't fixed. I think the pypa group is more focused on building yet another packaging standard.
That would be https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi/issues/827. 
In the standard library. [assertRaisesRegex](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestCase.assertRaisesRegex)
I was thinking of doing this, I'm glad it isn't worth my time ;). 
&gt; work.r He said Python, not R!
I think that you have not checked the repository. There a lot of useful integrations with cool tools.
Companys are doing more than just python, even the python-only-shops. And PyCharm falls very short on all things which are not python. So for a company it hardly makes sense to buy multiple PyCharms with devs above a certain level.
Also, there is a pretty clear vision. It's even publicly readable and has public discussion. It's just most people don't get involved.
Many thanks!
There is a [proposed metadata field](https://packaging.python.org/specifications/core-metadata/#description-content-type-optional) to allow this, so I imagine that Markdown support will probably be part of Warehouse (the new PyPI code), if it's not already.
When you say "I've got set", do you mean the options you set in PyCharm's HTTP Proxy settings?
In the EAP blog post comments we tried to make it clear that it was for Professional. In hindsight, we should have marked that as "Professional" in the original EAP blog post section.
I work with data at my day job, but haven't really felt the need for Pandas on most other projects I've worked/am working on.
What do u use for large data sets then? Or you don’t use anything? 
A real database.
Depends on the job really. If they are doing any decent sized data extraction I wouldn't be surprised. Other than that though I wouldn't say they are using it. 
Thanks for taking the time to file that issue (if it isn't you, make sure to comment on it.) It's assigned and Docker is getting a lot of attention from us. Unfortunately it's been fiddly supporting Docker over the last couple of years, and you're right, doing something in one place has consequences in another.
Any chance you could file a ticket? We can then go through the standard dance to get a log file etc. uploaded an analyze what's misfiring. We're starting the process of several interesting approaches to speeding up indexing, but there are tons of edge cases that we can't predict.
If he is coming from emacs, any mouse movement at all is too much. While you can configure pycharm to be mostly keyboard, it doesn’t flow quite as well. On the other hand it does other things better 
If you install ipython in your project interpreter, we'll use it as the Python Console. Is there something we're not doing right when using it?
Did you take a look at our [docs for remote setup](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/creating-a-remote-server-configuration.html) ? If so, what issue did you run into? As a note, the premise in PyCharm is that the official code is *local*, then pushed remote (so we can index/refactor etc.)
My company just gets the full suite for anyone that wants any jetbrains ide.
(I'm the PyCharm Dev Advocate.) I do a lot of fullstack stuff in PyCharm Professional. It includes all of WebStorm and DataGrip, both of which are fantastic. I don't think "very short" applies for our JS/HTML/CSS/DB support. It's true though that PyCharm is for Python on the backend. If you are polyglot on the backend too, then we suggest IntelliJ Ultimate, which covers essentially everything.
How good is the fulll suite for regular text-jobs (confic-files, logs, xml, etc.), remote-work and shell-stuff? How powerful is the editor nowadays compared to vim, emacs, sublime, etc.?
How much experience do you have with other environments? Or how often did you make serious comparations with vim-gurus and other devs of that type?
They are all based on intellij so they are basically the same for those tasks across the board. I personally use vscode for one off file edits, but have no problem working with yaml and XML in pycharm or intellij as part of a project.
You lack imagination or exposure. Why do you assume every software development is as your personal projects? Why does a web app have to bring in something fat as pandas? There are months where I don't even touch export or sheet functionality, and even then tablib or some csvwriter is fine to spit some spreadsheets.
Hey yeah I fed lack exposure. I did teach everything on my own. But thanks. Could you tell me what do you use? I’m always looking for self improvements. 
Aha, that's something I never really considered. Docker seems much more convenient for that though, but I haven't thoroughly ruled out loss of performance as a dealbreaker yet. It's on my todo-list though.
It would be very hard for me not to find $53 I could save somewhere else to allow me to develop on hardware over SSH. 
There named funny for speed. See https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonSpeed/PerformanceTips
Serious question: as a software engineer how could I volunteer my time to helping out routinely and consistently with PyPI? I'd love to give back to PyPI.
Yes, Yes it is. 
You're right that I don't have daily usage with each other editors/IDEs. Thus I try to avoid making claims about other tools. In this case, you asserted that PyCharm "falls very short" on non-Python. I thought I'd mention our web and db support, which IMO is very good. But perhaps you weren't referring to web/db.
Set memory temporarily to 4096mb, wait for it to do an index and then revert. Fixed it for me
