I’ve been looking through your code to get me started (I’m new to both Python and API calls). Good work! Would you be willing to shed some light on how you got your API key integrated into the URL? I suspect it has to do with Session (which I think is the superclass MarvelClient inherits?). Sorry if the question is dumb literally first attempt at Python. 
you can take a look at what we had running [here](https://github.com/kevin-fang/Relief-Mesh). It looks quite messy as we rushed through it so I apologize in advance.
Have you tried Google (or better yet—DuckDuckGo) 
Been working on a relatively lightweight web crawling framework built on top of [Asyncio](https://github.com/EdmundMartin/Scrapio). It's still very early days with it and the API is still changing quite frequently but I'm relatively pleased so far. &amp;#x200B; Need to work on some of the less fun stuff such as testing and producing proper documentation and properly document the existing examples.
I'm working on a Flask App which is going to act like a blog sort of things with users, liking sytem etc. Still a work in progress 
is it on github?

yup, this. I haven't put much thought into it yet, but based on a video I was watching this [guy on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCu7_D0o48KbfhpEohoP7YSQ/featured) who did some range tests and was able to get some extremely long distance connections

Funny thing seeing face_recognition there. I've been using it for a couple of weeks now to do some "light hacking", and I'm seriously thinking of changing my code to be a direct wrapper around dlib instead of using face_recognition as a helper library for a few (and increasingly fewer) functions. I can't say it's bad per se, but I don't agree with a few of the decisions the developer has taken, the function interfaces aren't clear or evident (maybe that's just me) and I'm always struggling with/against it to get it to do what I expect it to do.

Hi /r/python, I'm the creator behind flashcards for developers. We just put together a collection for Python developers. We would love your feedback and suggestions. Cheers!
Sorry for the delayed response: I've had to put this project on the back burner for a few weeks. I'll download Master soon and see if the contact_list gives me timing concerns and also try it with my app. I shouldn't have to do anything special to make the included contact_list demo use the list from master and not the installed pip module, right?
Let me guess: numpy, scipy, matplotlib, pandas, scikit-learn, tensorflow, keras? There's an article like this posted here every other day with the same information.
Are you doing this in a browser? Try checking out the selenium python module. What you're doing now sounds pretty tiring and fragile if something changes

Hmm not really. Do you need sth like this? `for level_1_key, level_1_value in datadict.items(): for level_2_key, level_2_value in level_1_value.items(): ... ` Sorry for the formatting I'm on mobile. 
Take a screen of the text that you need to find. Then use pyautogui to find it. pyautogui.locateOnScreen(“your pic.png”) You can write a loop to keep scrolling down if the locateOnScreen returns false.

/r/learnpython I'm not sure exactly what it is you're looking for. My understanding is that you have a dict of string keys to dict values, and those value dicts have string keys to dict values, and so on, and at the bottom level there are some values which are not dicts, but something else. Calling `.keys()` or `.items()` on the top-level dict will not recurse (it doesn't care what's in the entries, it just yields them). You can absolutely do a nested loop: for key1, val1 in my_dict.items(): if key1 != "FL": continue for key2, val2 in val1.items(): if key2 != "Manatee": continue # ... etc Everything returns a reference, so you can edit (mutable) values in-place - however, you shouldn't mutate anything you are currently iterating over (just like in basically every other language). It sounds like you have a tree data structure (that's not guaranteed, though), and that you want to do a breadth-first search ("I would like to walk one level at a time."). Nested for loops will never be appropriate for a BFS in any language, only a breadth-first search. The only reason `.items()` might look like it's recursing if the dict itself is recursive (i.e. it contains itself). The only python gotcha I can think of which might be relevant is if you have a function with a default argument, where the default argument is a dict - you shouldn't use a mutable as a default argument because it's only interpreted once, and subsequent calls use references to the same object. 
Well, no. But I hadn't decided how to store the data yet. So what I'm doing is scraping search results, then send a notification for any new results. I'm wanting to store the data only for the purpose of not getting multiple notifications for the same result. So would it be best to hash each result and then store the hashes in order to know which result is a new one?
Wouldn't know how to price this. the list is roughly 250k people long but a lot of the entries are going to be junk. 
Well it depends. Imagine you have something like: update accounts set balance = balance + 100 where number = 10; and two processes wants to do both the above update. You have to ask yourself, you want the second one to add another 100 after the first? So if my balance = 100, and the two processes both tries to execute the above the final result is balance = 300? In that case you don't have to do anything, and I repeat myself, that's because of isolation level, which by default is read committed in Postgres and it means that the second process writing will see the effect of the first. If you don't want the above to happen, well, then it depends on your requirements. If you have writes which do not depend on current value (e.g. SET field = f( field ) where f is a generic function) and it doesn't matter which process writes last, you can probably ignore all of this.
I'm an idiot - I had a pprint() statement that was dumping the entire data structure after my debug data - and I thought that was part of the keys() output. It's been a long day and I should step away from the KB...
Ah! That'd do it.
Definitely going to revisit this when I have more time
Did you profile the code to and see any bottlenecks? &amp;#x200B; if j in shortestRegion.values(): nextLine = True outputFile.write(line) This may benefit from a reverse mapping. Also you can use enumerate to ditch all the index counting.
Once you discover the threading macro (-&gt;&gt;), you'd be very annoyed by Python lacking it. At least, that was my experience. 
pyautogui and the like will only ever have access to what the screen looks like, not words and so on inside it. You'd need an extra library which can OCR the text for you (I don't have any recommendations). If you're doing it in a browser, though, you can use selenium as another poster said.
Step 1 figure out how much you want to pay
Figure out a projection of how many hours you think it will take, and apply a reasonable pay rate against that assessment. You can negotiate from there, pay rate is also fairly tied to locale. As an example, a talented programmer/engineer based somewhere like NYC probably wouldn't really consider the task unless you were paying something to the tune 150-250 an hour if this is a "work for hire" situation. However, if your locale is somewhere more rural that rate could go down significantly. In addition to considering rate, you need to also consider the level of engineer they are, if you are ok with hackier code you can consider a novice, but expect call backs and rehire for bug fixes if you do this, because they will happen.
Maybe try posting to /r/scraping
Let me know if you develop a figure, I might be interested.

Profiling code uses a 'program' to look for function calls and adds time it takes for you computer to process that function call. Then you can identify 'hotspots' in the code that either have a lot of function calls or a function that takes a long time to return a value. Some IDEs (like spyder) have it built-in but other CLI also exist. &amp;#x200B; With regards to your code I am a little baffled as to what you are actually storing. The gene names are every other line and the length of that gene is in the uneven lines. However, you are not storing the gene length imo? &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
The gene length is held in the fields[3] of the line opposite of the geneName line. I am not storing it as I am printing it to the deduplicated line. I know the code is not as clean as it could be, but it gets the job done. Oh well. I looked up the profiling idea in my IDE (pycharm) and will start using it! This is a great way to speed up scripts in the future. I appreciate all the help. Have an excellent day!!
“Add this to your ~/.zshrc or ~/.fishrc (or ~/.bashrc if you're still stuck in the 90's)” Nothing like being an asshole to your readers to make them think you’re competent.
Sure no problemo &amp;#x200B; &gt;The gene length is held in the fields\[3\] of the line opposite of the geneName line. I am not storing it as I am printing it to the deduplicated line. I know the code is not as clean as it could be, but it gets the job done. Oh well. I am more concerned about this line &amp;#x200B; if regionLength &lt; shortestRegion[geneName]: # Change the shortestRegion to the current line shortestRegion[geneName] = i-1 Your comment states that it states the shortestRegion to the current line, but it only changes the key geneName of the dict to the line before. I dunno how the data is organized, but assumingly it doesn't go through the genes iteratively. &amp;#x200B; Additionally, 30k lines reading per file (14) should not take 1 hour. &amp;#x200B; print(timeit.timeit('{i for i in range(int(3 * 1e4)) }', number = 100)) takes \~ .09 sec on my machine (sure it is not the same as IO operations but still).
Oh. I forgot to tell you, that I added the following. revDict = {v: k for k, v in shortestRegion.items()} and changed the if statement to if j in revDict: nextLine = True outputFile.write(line) revDict.pop(j, None) so it loops through the keys of the dictionary instead of the values, and then deletes it once it has been passed. The function now takes around 7 seconds to deduplicate 14 files containing 30,000 lines each. I'm sure it could be optimized much better, but that isn't really what I am concerned with. The idea of reversing the keys and values of the dictionary sped up the function considerably. Popping the values helped slightly. Thanks again!
Sure no prob. I have seen people in R cry so much with this. Hashtables aren't a real thing there. But in python it purrs like a Ferrari.
Cloned and playing with it now. I'm on Linux so I'll see if there's any optimizing I can do.

Every language has its frustrations. I just came to python this year from a history of C#, Scala, Java, JavaScript, C++, VBA, T-SQL, PL-SQL, and more languages I'd care to just forget... On the one hand, experience with different languages will help you think about approaches to problems a little differently (functional, statically typed vs dynamically typed, etc). But at the end of the day, you're just pressing the keyboard to make a computer do things. The language you use rarely really matter. From a popularity standpoint, python is growing, and one of the most popular language around. I don't think that's changing in the next 5 years. Python can cover a lot of ground, but what about the challenges outside of your core language itself? 1) Do you ever need to hit data storage (SQL, noSQL engines)? Adding some breadth may help you more than a new language. 2) Or, maybe a better question might be the scale of problems you work on? You mention pyspark, which at least implies large-scale data manipulation and some level of distributed computing. Something to expand on? 3) What about environment? Serverless? Cloud computing?
Great! Let me know if you have any questions, you can either reach me here or on twitter [@ImSh4yy](https://twitter.com/ImSh4yy)
Learning another language is definitely helpful in more ways than one. If you spend a few hundred hours getting comfortable writing idiomatic code, then its philosophy gets into your head and your programmer’s tool box gets that much bigger. Scala is such a large language that it’s essentially possible to write it in two styles: either “Java without semicolons”, or functional. Having done a bit of the former, I wouldn’t recommend it and if I needed a JVM language I’d look into Kotlin instead; the latter style (functional, full Scala enlightenment) is hard to pick up unless you’re on a team that embraces it or contributing to a good open source project. But if you’re looking for a functional language, for front end I’d suggest Elm, and for back end I’d suggest Elixir. They both have active and helpful communities. TypeScript is probably the safest bet commercially because JS is everywhere these days. Personally I steer clear of JS because it’s not a great language and node’s async style angers me (its creator now prefers Go, if that says anything). Personally, most of my professional coding for the last two years has been in Go and I love it because the language is for the most part very well designed. I prefer static languages because of the reasons you mentioned (maybe it’s just because I got my start in C++, but I think even in Python if I don’t know what type 95% of my variables should be, I’m doing something wrong). And Go has implicit fulfillment of interfaces, which is kinda like duck typing with compile time checks.
So that you some passion for your work and can work with others. I.e. create a project on github and/or contribute in some way to other open source python projects.
Work on “softer” skills like finding and fixing bugs, working with other developers and writing good feature requests and defect reports. You might look for an open source project you use and start contributing there and working with the current team. Working and communicating with others is sadly lacking in our field and experience in that arrays will probably stand out.
Maybe look at it the other way around. Build programs that are focused on problems or cool concepts that you'd like to solve for yourself, then find jobs that fit your skillset. Take me for example. I am interested in using python to handle mass data problems (like handling super massive spreadsheets and such). After I had a couple of those projects under my belt, I looked for jobs that fitted my skillset. Now I work as a software engineer developing similar projects as the projects I had under my belt when I applied for this job.
Today I published my first package to PyPI :) https://pypi.org/project/python-fieldclimate/
1. /r/learnpython 2. 4 spaces in front of each line to format code. There's no point in anyone trying to help you right now because python has meaningful whitespace, so without whitespace being rendered properly, there could be any number of errors. 3. Functions should use `snake_case`, not `UpperCamel` 4. You may be interested in the modulo operator `%` , and the `divmod` function

hi guys so my question is, right now my RLE code makes it so that if you type a string in a file it will come out as \['the letter', amount of them\], so they are in a list. however apparently that is not good enough for my assignment (as this has the risk of making file; larger apparently) i need to make a RLE where i get eg. phrase hhheeeellooooo to code into h3e4l2o5. i am really new ot coding so if anyone could lead me down the right path that would be realy appreciated :)
Far to vague, but make a function that has your repeated code in it and just call that 12 times. Any differences in how you copied and pasted it, figure out how to use the data to make those decisions instead of manually specifying it. To your question for row in rows: if not row: break do_stuff_with_row (row) 
Yeah sorry i figured i wasnt providing enough context. I will give this a shot. Thanks for taking time to help me

I think another often-overlooked benefit of contributing to open source is proving that you can dive into a bunch of code and understand it. In my opinion that speaks volumes about determination and passion to a recruiter.

Is that the correct format i should use in python or when pasting it to reddit. Genuinely curious because i know my python formatting is shocking.
Thanks for your help! I didnt know about that subreddit ill definitely use that in the future.
You should try with the framework flask, it’s very easy for this case. Sorry, my English is not good.
Check out Anaconda, or miniconda for a lighter install. Pretty much a necessity on Windows.

Dear God. Well, first break your code up into functions that take just one or three parameters, like line1G and line1H. Take all that str(line1h)[:7] stuff and just do it once. Once you've condensed verbose repetition into concise repetition, then see how to condense it further, like in a for loop
see [Brython](https://brython.info/) for the *fun* of it.
Yes, but that's not going to happen.
Branch out, learn a second language. I rarely see a job opening for *just* python, there's typically multiple languages listed. I recommend C/C++ or Java. C/C++ allow you to understand most C-based languages and Java is trial by OOP. Do any sort of collaborative work. Open Source is good, but building something with someone else is too.

OP's code, but with formatting: quarter = 25 dime = 10 nickel = 5 penny = 1 change = input('How much change? ') def Quarters(remainderq): if change // quarter &gt;= 0: remainderq = change // quarter print(remainderq + "Quarter(s)") else: print("No Quarters") def Dimes(remainderd): if change - (remainderq * quarter) &gt;= 0: remainderd = (change - (remainderq * quarter)) // dime print(remainderd + "Dime(s)") else: print("No Dimes") def Nickels(remaindern): if change - (remainderd * dime) &gt;= 0: remaindern = (change - ((remaindq * quarter) +(remainderd * dime))) // nickel print(remaindern + "Nickel(s)") else: print("No Nickels") def Pennies(remainderp): if change - (remaindern * nickel) &gt;= 0: remainderp = (change - (((remainderq * quarter) + (remainderd * dime) + (remaindern * nickel)))) // penny print(remainderp + "Penny(s)") else: print("No Pennies")) 
&gt; line1A = excel.iloc[0, 0]; &gt; There are 12 sets of these declarations. One option is to change the temporary variables into a function call, ex: import string def get_cell(excel, label): """ Label is a two-character string from 0A to 9Z this will break with other things like 4AB or 99C """ (row, letter) = (label[0], label[1]) # Rows in excel are 1-indexed, but 0-indexed in API row -= 1 # If letter not already upper-cased, change it letter = letter.upper() # Find position of letter in alphabet, where 0 is first column = string.ascii_uppercase.index(letter) return excel.iloc[row, column]; 
You're using the remainder variables where they are not in scope. For instance, in dimes, you're using remainderq and the dimes function does not have any knowledge of that. Variable. And ,if I'm understanding your question right, you just need to call each function you've written, start with quarters, then dimes, then nickles, then pennies. You will either need to reduce the change variable in each function or return the amount of unused change from each function and pass that value to the next function. Pass the origin change value to quarters to start. 
I didn't think any Windows programs just looked for a Python.exe on the path and used it? I thought they all bundled their own Python for exactly this reason (and the fact that Python doesn't come with Windows standard).
Fiance came home and told me she needed a script to check to see if a specific vendor was adding/removing different fabrics from their site. She said she spent the better part of the day determining what was new vs discontinued then comparing that with inventory at her work. After a couple hours of work, I wrote a script that pulls the data from the vendor's page and compares it to a baseline file. It identifies what was added and removed, then emails her the results at the first of the month. Also, each time the script runs and after the email is sent, the baseline file is replaced by the most recent version of the list. Now she won't have to manually compare it again!
A quick point of clarification to help python newcomers: a few comments here recommend `virtualenv` which, while a great tool, wouldn't have helped OP. * Tools like `virtualenv`|`pipenv`|`venv` help with **application and library isolation**. * A tool like `pyenv` will help with **python version isolation**. This would have helped OP avoid messing up his OS installed python in this instance. On Windows I'm told that `pyenv` works very well under Windows Subsystem for Linux, assuming you have Windows 10 Anniversary edition or newer.
This great [stackoverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/41573588/2444267) goes into more detail on the current state of python packaging.
Thank you for sharing your knowledge!! This is very helpful. 
Sure. And there are a handful of other libraries that attempt to compile python to JS (transcrypt, jiphy, numscrypt, rapydscript). My (limited) experience trying them out though is the experience is lacking and frustrating compared to using JS or another language designed for transpiling to JS. Yes, it's nice being able to write python style, but any sort of issue or debugging in say javascript console becomes significantly more complicated.
open up a command prompt, go to a folder, and type `python -m venv venv` - this creates a clean virtual environment in a folder called venv. In PyCharm, you can press `ctrl + shift + a` to open the quick search and type "project interpreter". In that, add `venv\scripts\python*.exe` as the interpreter. 
I gave it a shot with in-place Numpy operations and even with parallel acceleration from Numba it was still over 30 times slower than my original code. That's using this fairly basic function though. I'm sure there are faster ways to go about it with Numpy but I can't see it making up the difference. @njit(parallel=True, fastmath=True) def generateMandelbrotSet( complexSet, iterations, result, temp): for i in range(1, iterations + 1): temp = temp ** 2 + complexSet result += (((np.abs(temp) &gt;= 2) &amp; (result == 0)) * i) #temp *= (np.abs(temp) &lt;= 2) #result += (result == 0) * iterations return result
Ya. I haven't made the attempt in a while, but attempting to install anything that requires compilation in Windows via pip is a huge pain in the ass unless you're extremely comfortable with Ms build tools and willing to download a whole bunch of unsupported versions for older versions of Python from random sites. You'll save hours or days by just using anaconda because of the prebuilt binaries.
If you set pycharm as the default handler, any time a .py file is activated, it uses pycharm (or tries to). It's like using Notepad to read .txt files, and then installing Notepad++ and setting it as the default. Whenever you, or anything else on the computer, tries to open a .txt, it'll open Notepad++.
For the curious, the Internet Archive has snapshots of what it used to be. Not going to link it directly since some people don't read before clicking, but it's at https://web.archive.org if you enter "python\.com".
Yeah this sounds incredibly bizarre and I assume OP is mistaken
I'm pretty sure it's not that. Launching it with an array containing fewer than 1000 elements can still cause it to crash.

Thank you, I’ll look and post there!
it says an indention error on line 5
Well, in python indentation is part of the language, everything written after the ':' must be indented four spaces to the right. 
Could you compare this to [PyFlame](https://github.com/uber/pyflame)? When would Austin be a better choice?
Disclaimer: I don't know your age, the country you live in and hiring practices there, YMMV. 1. Go try out a few interviews. Maybe you'll succeed. Regardless you will learn a lot. 2. The best way to be employable is to get relevant experience. Most of my advice below will be relevant to that. 3. Contribute to an existing open source project. 4. If you're doing a project - build a **useful** project to completion (something that other people would want). For example - build a website that does something cool, set it up with an actual domain, add analytics, etc. Make it into something that works and not just a toy project. Make it into something that other people use and provide you feedback on. 1. As a corollary - you may want to learn some JS skills and tag yourself as a "full stack developer". (e.g. build the front-end with react) 2. Alternatively, work on AWS and tag yourself as a "devops engineer". You would need a relevant project of course (e.g. scraping at scale is an easy example) 5. Learn general programming skills and knowledge - definitely learn how to use GIT, and something from networking, machine learning, etc. Joining an existing project and coding according to their standards will help. 6. If relevant for you (not for everyone, not for all financial situations and not for all ages) try to get an internship at a software development company. This might be the quickest way to get relevant experience. 7. Read Joel Spolsky's guide: [https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2006/10/25/the-guerrilla-guide-to-interviewing-version-30/](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2006/10/25/the-guerrilla-guide-to-interviewing-version-30/) This will help you understand what employers are looking for. &amp;#x200B;
as far as I know - yes somthing like: a = 0 b = 10 while a &lt;= b: print("no“) if a == b: print(”yes“) break 
Nothing wrong with your code (you could have used math.pi instead of 3.14) Editor name and error message could help ?
sorry, it’s not taking the indentation 😂
I do have WSL in Windows 10. Some people have recommended Anaconda which I have no clue about. Very confused now about how to keep my tools working and also get an IDE and Python for dev work using v3.

You need to ask in /r/RequestABot. The people in that sub write reddit bots as a hobby. The people of this sub, and learnpython as well, are in the subs because of their interest in the language. Although there is some overlap between the subreddits, it's still proper to keep things on topic. 
Yeah it never saw mine as well
&gt; +bonus question: do you regret voluntarily switching away from python? 100% regret going over to the node/js side of things. I have all these terms in my head, which are really flashy and all but hold no real value to me.
&gt; The language you use rarely fundamentally matters. I would argue otherwise. Yes, this is true upto some degree, even for python. But when your language is so good that you don't need patterns xD https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er5K_nR5lDQ
/r/learnpython
Switch to linux, jk, but just be a little more careful. If you want to use the newer python, I would just recommend separating your scripts by version and making sure you execute python or python3. If you want to debug and test what works and what not it sounds like you should run a VM.
Not a single program I know runs .py files as executables. Most just run `[venv]/bin/python.exe script.py`, or `C:\Python27\python.exe script.py`
I'm just restating what OP said. Crucify me.
I'm working on an integration server between GitHub and Jira. First goal was to automatically transition issues when labels are added/removed in GitHub. It's my first time really using python so I'm sure I make a lot of rookie mistakes but it's fun!
I recently used py-spy to great ends, so I'll have to check this one out too!
Right path at your current state would be a Python tutorial as you seem to get the basics wrong. (Semicolon, adding to variables, looping, context managers) You should read the documentation of the stuff you’re using. This would probably also help get a few things right. https://docs.python.org is your friend.
/r/learnpython 
Of course it's possible. 1: /r/learnpython 2: read the sidebar 3: google ffs.
PyFlame uses ptrace. Austin samples the state completely asynchronously. It does not affect the sampled process and can sample at much higher frequencies.
1) yes it depends on indentation only to decide what belongs to the if statement vs what comes after. Essentially international replace {} in defining code blocks 2) built in types are objects in pythons. So when you create a new variable of type string it inherits all the methods that comes with that. And then you can define your own methods to it 
&gt;anything else on the computer, tries to open a .txt, it'll open Notepad++. Clearly not true. Does python's open() use notepad?
Doing a lot of infrastructure programming on all sorts of flavors of Linux, I'd say that broken dependencies is not the most outstanding feature of programs written in Python. Poor code quality dominates that. I've ran into a lot of bugs in programs endowed with a lot of responsibility, like `fedup` or `yum` or `anaconda` (the installer, not the alternative Python build). But, to put the credit where it's due: Python's package management is a pile of steaming poop, so, it's not surprising that programs break once unrelated things get updated. Especially in the light of a lot of large projects cannot even get their own dependencies sorted out and knock themselves over without any external help from crafty users messing with them. For example, `azure-cli` as of today, is, in principle, not installable by `pip`, even though it's all on pypi.org. If you look at it from up close, it's a perfect example for case studies of everything that's wrong with Python packaging and distribution.
Not helpful, unless you are being sarcastic. I know Python. 
So how would "string" be treated in this case? What happens to our A variable?
I just tested this and I don't see any bundled python on my system. In any case as soon as I install a Python version it will get added to path and registered as handler for .py so it will break old scripts. Any OS (Windows or Linux) will lookup registered handler for a file ext to run it.
The heap is sorted from smallest to largest; if you fill it with just items from the stream that sort order will be determined by how the items themselves compare, rather than their length. Since you're using strings, you'll get lexicographic sort order ("ZZZ" sorts before "z") rather than length-first, then lexicographic, which is what the above example is creating. As for why **islice**, that appears to be intended to optimize for larger or indefinite length streams, rather than convert the entire thing into a list in memory, then heapify that. It seems fairly reasonable code for the problem being apparently addressed, not something trying to be excessively clever.
You know, I've read so much praise about pip and how its comparable to npm but in my experience npm is so much better and it just works all the time, for really big projects as well.
From the sidebar: &gt; News about the dynamic, interpreted, interactive, object-oriented, extensible programming language Python This is not the place to post code. That's what r/learnpython is for.
Won't that also mean that there's no guarantee that the leafs are actually sampled?
This is an encoding problem, you are mixing up Windows-1252 (ISO 8859-1) and UTF-8.
Good point, appreciate the correction :)
Thanks! It didn't work though, I'm afraid :-(
a clbuttic mistake happened
You don't necessarily need another programming language in your portfolio. I've been doing pure python 7+ years now professionally, no other language. Employers are often looking for expertise in a single language, and python is everywhere, but portfolio wise you want to spread out with related skills and technologies like django, flask, mysql, mongo, elasticsearch, aws, hadoop, whatever. They will want a python developer with expertise in *specific technologies*, or a specific skillset. I've been doing security related work for a while now, worked on a research team, and python+security is what gets me jobs. One language + other skillsets and domain knowledge. It's much easier to match on a specific language that they use heavily. You won't have trouble with python, especially if you open yourself up to web dev. Of course for web dev and fullstack positions you will often run into needing javascript as well, but that's obvious.
It is written as utf-8, hence the mojibake. I rather think the problem is that the program OP use to view the file tries to be smart about decoding file content, sometimes failing to detect the file as UTF-8.
* What happens if you write an æ at the biginning of the file. Do that change change the frequency of "sometimes"? * Which OS are you using? * What are you reading the output file with? * Kan du sige rødgrød med fløde?

Ack! Windows is outside my comfort zone. A final guess: What happens if you write a [BOM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_order_mark) at the beginning of the file?
Not entirely related to your question but I'm guessing you're 26/27... You're still very young so I wouldn't worry too much about it. You could change languages in 10 years and you would still be relatively young.
**Byte order mark** The byte order mark (BOM) is a Unicode character, U+FEFF BYTE ORDER MARK (BOM), whose appearance as a magic number at the start of a text stream can signal several things to a program consuming the text: The byte order, or endianness, of the text stream; The fact that the text stream's encoding is Unicode, to a high level of confidence; Which Unicode encoding the text stream is encoded as.BOM use is optional. Its presence interferes with the use of UTF-8 by software that does not expect non-ASCII bytes at the start of a file but that could otherwise handle the text stream. Unicode can be encoded in units of 8-bit, 16-bit, or 32-bit integers. For the 16- and 32-bit representations, a computer receiving text from arbitrary sources needs to know which byte order the integers are encoded in. *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Python/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28

Just read up on python virtual environments, you don’t have to use Anaconda if you don’t want to. There are a number of solutions. Virtual environments are exactly the solution to your problem, though.
Did you make this up? This shouldn’t be how it works. Windows does not come with a python interpreter so amongst other reasons under windows python utilities always bundle their own interpreter.
Thanks for the question. There are two points here. One is that Austin is written in C so is much faster than CPython. On average you can expect that Austin is quick enough to sample a valid frame stack. Things could get dramatic at high sampling rates, but on average the invalid samples should be a tiny portion of the overall samples. The other point is that, even if you halt CPython and then sample, there is no guarantee that you have paused at a point where the frame stack is in a valid state. You could have been so unlucky that the profiler decided to pause exactly when CPython is updating the frame stack data structures.
I guess I'm a single developer upto now, and I can understand django's magic pretty well. Which makes it awesome for me because I have really figured out how to make 10 lines of code do the work for 100 xD. Which might not be desirable in a corporate environment, but is quite extendable since I only have to make one little change, and get the effect throughout the codebase. &gt; with a heavy frontend I'm curious again! How was integration with js libraries like react? Talking about my experience, the js community is just so hostile to anything except node backends. Had to create a package to solve that myself :/ https://github.com/pycampers/react-pages
Austin doesn't stop CPython to sample the frame stack. This means that, with a reasonable sampling interval, there is no impact on the performance of the application being profiled. Hence is can be used live on production code.

The best language is always the one that works best for you. &gt; I'm curious again! How was integration with js libraries like react? Imo, the ideal structure has no "integration". I have a react frontend which will make API calls to the server, which responds with JSON. The frontend then works with the raw data. Alternatively, you can render the pages on the server (templated, react on the server, etc), but it often makes the server and frontend very coupled. I like having them completely seperate, so I can re-write my server or frontend very easily, if I ever need to.

Can you show us the full traceback?
Building a parser for converting and extracting data from legal documents (technically, I have a law degree and am self taught at programming). It has a custom pattern-building engine which allows to build HUGE regex via a templating system so you don’t cross your eyes and are able to fix single portion of patterns without headache . The templating system allows for “named” yet non-capturing groups (for stuff you want to be able to template in with ease, but don’t want in matches group, such as stop words or-ed together) and implements dynamic backreferences, so you don’t have to think about the group numbers. It has classes that wrap re.match() and re.group() to allow sub-group querying and serializing everything in a nice looking json. The engine is built to be reusable and general purpose. Just put in your pattern templates in the config directory. Hoping to be able to open source it as soon as the project is wrapped.

This is entirely not true at least on linux, all programs come packages with their own venv and python versions. Even if this was not the case and some poor sap codes to rely on the env python, pycharm works its interpreters in venv too without touching the env.
 Yeah not sure in what course this was, but sometimes these professors think it is clear whereas for people just starting out it may be very hard. To be fair the code above wasn't my preferred method of doing it also, but I thought it was insightful as to how one could go around doing it. In all honesty the matrix method, although elegant, gets you in a lot of problems when your network gets bigger. Just imagine 6k x 6x sparse matrix, then you would be storing mostly zeros 'just to have no for loops'. In my toolbox I convert the networkx graph to a internal adjacency list object, that has O(1) look-up. This benefits me as my graphs are sparse and I can't create the A matrix due to lack of memory ;-)

&gt; however apparently that is not good enough for my assignment (as this has the risk of making file; larger apparently) It's not actually possible for a compression algorithm to turn every possible file into one with a smaller size. The total number of possible files with N bytes is 256^(N), but the total number with fewer than N bytes is 256^(N)-1.
Yeah, who knows. We're just meant to be looking at the properties of sync and complex networks. But he seems far more focused on us learning to program than analysing the results. I honestly couldn't care about processor time, all I need is a result I can cut/paste in to my final report. Oh well, he gave us a 10 hour extension. that should at least give me enough time to write it up. I was quite happy with my 21*21 network. I'm not sure what more i'll see adding another 3500 nodes to it. Oh well, see how I go.

Then you should know that it's versatility, but also its complexity, exceeds that of windows.

I think the important stuff in OS X is tied to the system python which only uses in built packages.

Ok, I will make a guide for you.
I can see where I should work but do you actually have the rest API working... Can you post to it now and get responses?
OP is using Airflow given the graph at the top. So Anaconda makes a \_little\_ more sense. Personally I wouldn't use anaconda in production.
My guess you could express something similar to that with Altair. You could also get it to be interactive. However, the biggest hurdle I've found with altair is that it's quite complex, and there are many "unexplored areas" -- so whenever you steer a bit away form the examples, you're pretty much on your own. Once you figure things out, it's very good though.
I don't think it's intentional, but something's missing here. That should not normally happen, there's something funky with your system.

Why not? I'm building an android app that connects to the server, sends a request to run a file and launch it. That's it.
I honestly don't have much of an opinion of it either way, just making lewd jokes.
Use colorama [https://pypi.org/project/colorama/](https://pypi.org/project/colorama/) and basically do the following: from colorama import Fore, Back, Style, init init() print(Fore.RED + Back.RED + 'This is a red text with a red background') Enjoy :)
I never said I wrote it i'm just using it. I know there is a security issue but for now i'm just trying to see if this works or not. 
A kernel is an elementwise function. Ary can have any shape and dtype so long as it fits in memory. foo = ones(10,10) foo *= 2 foo += 1 foo /= 3 The above constitutes 3 kernels if you ignore the one used to initialize the array (ary). 
It's not about a security issue, it's about you not understanding what the code you're using even _does_. That code does not, ever, execute any external programs - there's simply nowhere in the code that says "run this program the user asked you to". Why are you expecting it to work?
Teach them to code in python or explain what a programming language is? Pythons usually pretty great for beginners because its syntax is very readable. 
fbs doesn't yet support automatic updates, esp. on Windows. (Linux and Mac will come soon.) So you'd still have to do that yourself. Other than that, it should be a lot easier than hand-crafting everything yourself. Regarding .spec files: You can invoke PyInstaller in any way you like - and thus also use your own spec file. But dependencies and data files can also (and more easily) be handled by fbs. Eg. data files work by you simply putting them in a certain directory (src/main/resources). For more info, please see the Manual at https://build-system.fman.io/manual/
I'm aware of what it does I just don't know how capable it is which is why i'm asking this in the first place. I was told that I can customize the rest api server to do it but I don't know how.
So, can you please explain to me what it does? 
Thanks!
LOL that's also what I thought. The funny thing is that I'm *already* using something else (mainly Atom, though I've tried out VS Code as well (and also VS Community because school)) so I really don't need IDLE. I am fully aware that IDLE is a bad editor for actual serious and/or large scale development (given the "L", I'd also assume it isn't and was never meant to be), but there's something about its simplicity that I find rather charming and attractive. I honestly enjoy using it slightly more (for Python stuff obviously) than I do Atom, which is sad because Atom is just a fancy-pants text editor without the necessary extensions.

Start with async/await.
It works but its not mine, i'm just using it. It just takes put,get,requests for a dictionary called records but i'm trying to see if it works with directories of the host machine
Yes, you can post single lines `with backticks` (\`) , and full blocks like this if maintains spacing That's site-wide.
So, why dont I ever tell my program to execute any external programs? I don't care if it's a bad thing just if it works or not.
You've assumed they haven't made any whitespace errors, which is not necessarily a safe assumption.

Cool I been down voted... So I am not going to tell u exactly how to get it to work then u wouldn't learn anything. But let's start with this. Forget about this code for a minute. Write a standalone script that will launch the program your trying to launch. Make sure it works by it's self. Now that it works in this API script add a post route. Import the script you just wrote that launches the program. Now have it so that when. You make a post to the route you added it calls the script that u wrote to launch the program. The. You can make the response whatever u want. Keep in mind you my have to run the script a thread with threading depending on how u write you launcher script.

I hope my post is helpful. All feedback is welcome.
He's either not being clear or a complete bullshit artist * he is talking about his own scripts. This makes sense-- he installed Python, he ran the files in some way that used windows file semantics to link against the interpreter instead of calling the interpreter and the script directly as a module. Now he imstalled PyCharm, windows defaulted to setting PyCharm as the default opener, his scripts won't open. * he's talking about other people's stuff, ex dropbox or mutorrent (or is it bittorrent? I forget?), in which case he's an utter bullshit artist because those programs bind to their own interpreter/subset of the runtime.
Any of you know the best way for beginner.

In my experience all blcok lists are poorly maintained (looking at you Trend Micro putting a PLC related website into the gaming category).
&gt; Any OS (Windows or Linux) will lookup registered handler for a file ext to run it. That's not true at all. My .py files are associated with VSCode and have int he past been associated with PyCharm. I've had 0 issues.
Not sure what you mean by what happen to it, the value stays the same unless you change it but you can use a method to return some modification if it for example a = “Hello” print(a) // prints Hello print(a.lower()) // prints hello But a never changed. 
Wasn't me though i'll upvote you for the helpful answer. I'm quite new to Python so it's difficult to ask the right questions about something I hardly know. But thanks for your response, i'll give it a try.
before any of that, i would look at SOLID and GRASP principles
I think git bash is just using mingw toolchain. Nothing wrong with that, but same as saying, just don't use Windows. Also for what it's worth you're probably better off using wsl these days.
after years of coding on a mac, going from total python noob to doing experimental shit and having a mess of native Python, Brew, Anaconda, Macports and everything active at the same time, I have never been able to damage/fault another program. It is messy, but it is pretty robust. 
Is that so, u/BuyChristianSlaves?
The random generator provided by the random module is not cryptographically secure. Using Secrets module we can produce random-numbers and tokens which are secure and useful in security-sensitive applications secrets module is added in Python 3.6 and onwards.
As a quick solution, you could use py.exe to open py files. You can then just add a shebang to your scripts specifying the python version to use. You can read more about it in the python documentation under python on windows. 
You didn't mention that in the original post. The raspberry pi has GPIO pins you could use to control stuff. In any case, whether necessary or not, you can definitely use both in the way you want, yes.
Thanks, this is very helpful.
&gt; how many programs use Python under the hood. on Windows: for example ?
Head over to /r/learnpython They may have resources there. I personally have no idea how to relate anything programming to people who don't have some foundation. It's a mind set I cannot comprehend.

First data pipeline, using a bunch of script and a DB for data. Can you suggest something light, but more advanced (Airflow or Luigi are too big for my task).

Thanks! Changing focus from: \- \`B is subclass of class A\` if \`B inherits from A\` to \- \`B is subtype of type A\` if \`B can be used whenever A is expected\` was helpful in my case. Plus, \`A\` and \`B\` could be \`Callable\`, which initially wasn't intuitive to me.
why not?
Not at all. The typing error is indicative of a logic error (trying to pass an object that isn’t what the function expects). My reaction to the article was “well, duh!” because I’m used to statically-types languages.
 import this is still relevant
Yeah, this is pretty obvious for Java or C# developers and we Pythonistas should learn from them. Sometimes ;)
So a.lower() is the same as lower(a) in other languages can we also not do lower(a)?
neat concept. going to have to try this.
I prefer to use pip using the python binary, instead of a separate pip, as I find it tough to know which one goes with which. &amp;#x200B; Try typing python3 -m pip install neovim
I have gone from PLSQL, to Java, to Python, to Go, to TypeScript and back (!), in 7 years. Languages are a toolkit; what fits a projects need best. Diversify as much as you can; you will become a useful engineer when design decisions are to be made. TypeScript is wonderful - I strongly encourage exposure to it. A lot of frameworks are looking at type safety as the new standard. The business case for JavaScript, actually, is becomming something far more considered as before; due to type safety and the maturity of web frameworks.. and, Node. JavaScript based architecture can still edge toward a tangled web of services but, less so. IMHO. 
What language are you coming from? 
Good work! I'm sure you've encountered most of what I'm going to mention here in the research for your post, but I'll go ahead and mention a few things anyway for people who stop by and want to dive deeper. &amp;#x200B; What you've encountered here is an example of the [Liskov Substitution Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liskov_substitution_principle). It states, quite simply, that if S is a subtype of T, then T may be replaced by S without changing anything . Without delving any further into the implications of that (co - and contravariance), it's clear that your original code violates this. Substituting Dog for Animal with the eat method overridden to be more specific very much changes the properties of the code. &amp;#x200B; Why is this so completely unintuitive? That's really because dynamically typed languages (especially Python and Ruby) *intentionally ignore* the LSP. This is what we call Duck Typing. You can override methods in your classes willy nilly in Python *by design.* It's easier and more flexible and faster to do this. But it's also less safe. Python was never intended to be type safe. It was intended to be flexible and easy and fast. In other languages , you would never have been allowed to do this in the the first place. It's also, just by the way, one of the reasons that programmers from other language backgrounds often really dislike Python. &amp;#x200B; This intuitive--yet theoretically wrong--approach to types is the reason that Type hinting in Python has taken so long to implement and has been so gradually introduced. Strong, safe type systems violate assumptions and expectations that Python developers have had ingrained in them for decades. &amp;#x200B; There's specific discussion about this involving GvR and other Python core developers [here](https://github.com/python/typing/issues/241). How do we have a strong type system and still allow the basic Pythonic lenience that developers expect and want? It's a hard question (not to mention, an issue that's still open). &amp;#x200B; [This](https://stitcher.io/blog/liskov-and-type-safety) is a really excellent exploration of LSP and type safety in general. Not specific to Python, but examples along similar lines as your blog post that express the ideas without reference to Python's theoretically wonky class inheritance mechanism and MRO. &amp;#x200B; And finally, this is a great lead-in to posts like [this](http://blog.thedigitalcatonline.com/blog/2014/05/19/method-overriding-in-python/). If you've ever read a python blog or Stack Overflow answer where the author says something along the lines of, "You *can* do things that way, but you really shouldn't. You should do things *this* way. And when you override a method in a subclass, you should always call the super class implementation first and then extend or limit it." and then you're like, "Why the fuck would I do that? That seems so pointless? I don't have to do that, and it's a lot of extra cognitive overhead. Not to mention extra code, and it feels gross because I don't really understand it." &amp;#x200B; Well, this is why. If you're going to take the step from writing one-off scripts and utility packages and glue code to actually developing applications and frameworks, this becomes important. It's not required by any means, but it will make your code better, safer, and easier to work on as it grows. It will make it easier to collaborate with other developers, it will make your code easier for future-you to understand, and it will be less likely to blow up in your face when you aren't expecting it.
Read Fluid Python, the best intermediate book IMO. Not all of it will make sense first time around, but as you get more experience the relevance of some of the more advanced concepts will become clear. 
I suppose this is a service, so it's not possible to download a collection of flashcard, import them into something like anki and use offline?
It's a good article but I wish people would try to use modified real code examples rather than creating "Animal" (or car) classes. It's difficult to link the example problem to real life problems when the examples are contrived.
&gt; It's a common acronym in the world of investing. And teens.
I believe the problems exist - but only when you choose to use types. And they can be avoided without losing anything of value by just not using types.
You must want to learn python to build something that python is good at building. Build that thing. Use the docs and stackoverflow to help you get past syntax. Become comfortable experimenting in the interpreter.
Wow, thanks, i will wait :) 
&gt;I wish people would try to use modified real code examples I think a simple example with types/classes that everyone understands is appropriate for this article. &amp;#x200B;
Yeah if Squirrel.Windows works well enough and is well supported that seems like a good path for updates. The Atom / Electron folks don't seem to have too much trouble making it work for them so it should work for python.
Thank you SOOO much! It works like a miracle! I almost thought I never would overcome this, you made my day!
Just gotta simplify. Most people understand logic just fine. Sometimes they just need help understanding how to break it down into a problem. It also helps if you don't take syntax shortcuts like -= Once they understand the problem IF barry has three apples THEN take an apple Then you throw in your language syntax. my_apples = 0 barrys_apples = 38374738 if barrys_apples &gt;= 3: barrys_apples = barrys_apples - 1 my_apples = my_apples + 1 After that then you get into readability, etc. 
+1 When you think you know some Python and Luciano Ramalho tells you otherwise. :)
One suggestion would be to take something you coded in Java and recode it in Python. There are great resource learning sites out there and in most of them you can skip past the fundamentals at the beginning.
And not just tkinter. I can't find a single python GUI library that works in Mojave. I seriously regret upgrading.
No, I installed PyCharm and it took over .py which broke other prgrams that used Python. Why would I make this up?
Nothing in Windows does. 3rd party utils do. And how is it my fault? You can install a program and it can break other stuff. The programs don't even mention they depend on Python.
There are no end-user facing third party utilities that automatically bind to a python executable unless they provide it itself in some kind of archival format. If you claim such, give examples and we can disprove in a heartbeat. You're bullshitting for karma.
Well, yeah, but that's sort of missing the point. Even giving them the benefit of the doubt with possible whitespace errors, I can count five or six non-idiomatic usages of Python and three other ways this code is broken entirely.
Start using is. Also, /r/learnpython and read the sidebar. Misc: If you use oracle products, they provide a ton of java code samples for most of their products. Increasingly, they've been providing equivalent python as well, for side-by-side comparison.
I’m not really referring to npm or pip breaking architectures- I’m referring to users making root/admin level changes and not understanding how their changes will affect the system. While I hope these big package handlers like npm or pip wouldn’t let me break my own system, it’s foolish to trust the programs and you should understand what changes you are making.
You tell me lmao 
are you looking for help or someone to make one for you? the API docs are really well done and there's a lot of examples out there of some good startup code if you google something like "discord python bot"
&gt; This is a really excellent exploration of LSP and type systems in general. Not specific to Python, but examples along similar lines as your blog post that express the ideas without reference to Python's theoretically wonky class inheritance mechanism and MRO. Not to rain op OP's parade, but that link actually explained it much clearer than what OP wrote :s Thank you for clarifying.
Did you mean Fluent Python? Fluid Python shows no search results for me 
 bro I do not have time, this answer tells you how to use nssm, with that program you run any python script as a service, it is very easy to use. luck. r/https://stackoverflow.com/a/32133851 
I accuse you of lying because it's beyond obvious that you are. To lie about the inner workings of basic development information on a fucking programming subreddit is an idiotic thing to do! Your post wasn't "detailed"-- it was a few paragraphs of utter fluff and "oh my god python is great look so many things use it". So either prove it or admit your falsehoods.
Yeah, that works for toy problems. A lot of the difficulty comes from the jump from there to real situations. Going from those sort of things you are describing to asynchronous event driven coding of a mobile app and they are just like 'huh?'. Just trying to explain this method is triggered when a user does this or when the screen renders or when the component object is created. I recognize a lot of it as me. I take a lot of knowledge I have as given when it isn't but it takes me a long time to cycle back through any explanation I am giving to try and find the actual common point between me and another person. It's frustrating and I lack the patience for it.
Saying anything good about Python has recently been easy karma. "Here's my first python script! I'm so proud!" &gt;&gt; got 200 pts in a few hours.

First off you can choose the Python interpreter in PyCharm. If you didn't uninstall the older version of Python you can fix this by going to Run &gt; Edit configuration &gt; Python interpreter (choose correct one). If you're running the Python scripts out of PyCharn you will have to set the Python environmental variable to the correct path. You should always using be environments and not only using the root Python version. I would pip freeze &gt; requirements.txt Download and install Anaconda Create an environment with the correct Python version Go into the environment pip install - r requirements.txt You can then use the instructions above to configure PyCharm or windows to reference the correct Python interpreter for the enviroment.

Know the basics, not need to dive too deep, just be sure you can interact with them 4. Play with a library. If you want web it can be either server side (flask/django etc.) or client side (some JS smething) 5. Work with people: try to contribute to open source project. Verify bug, submit a fix etc. This wil help you getting a job. Knowing how to design (craft) software will come in time

It's not foolish to trust programs. You trusted your browser to post your message to this thread, right? You didn't call Reddit developers and asked them to verify that your post was actually saved, replicated, archived etc. in all the required edge servers and caching servers, did you? You just assumed that the function of this text box is to let you type it, and that it doesn't distort your message and that the function of the "reply" button is to initiate the sending of your message and so on. Users have certain expectations of programs, and they should trust them to live up to those expectations, otherwise they wouldn't be able to do any work on a computer at all. What I'm saying is that Python users, generally, expect the packaging system to produce sane results... and that often times it doesn't live up to that expectation. I don't have any statistics at hand, but I'd imagine that the number of times anyone screwed up their system through a mistake (such as oversight, misunderstanding of functionality etc.) would be less than the number of times when desired and expected functionality wasn't there, when things that should be obvious to everyone ware somehow not obvious to the person writing the program. And example of that is how `pip` installs packages: for no real reason it only allows one version of a package, while also precluding Python programs from declaring which versions of installed packages they need. This is counter-intuitive because the need is so obvious nobody would really think that a sane programmer would have not done it this way, and yet...

The code on the external server would need to provide an API for you to do that. If its your external server you could make an API that launches a program and then call it as you want. Of course, anyone else could send requests and launch programs too.

I introduced 2 more issues which will need a good amount of time to complete, check the repository!
Anaconda is good for getting tooling and shit in place but on prod you should really only have the bare bones. Just your favourite python dependency manager pulling in the bits you need for your code to work. Less moving parts, less room for fuck ups.
I mean, there is kinda an entire field of math and compsci devoted to making new algorithms. That's why the idea that this is "all" algorithms is a non-starter.
What even is this? You should definitely get to know the foundations of a language before you attempt to teach it.
Ah, okay. Up until now I've been fairly ignorant of how CUDA works behind the scenes. Numba usually does a fairly good job of dispatching parallel code to a graphics card transparently so this is the first time I've come up against it. On further inspection it looks like it's a timeout in the graphics driver. If code running on a graphics card doesn't halt after two seconds Windows will interpret it as a system hang and reset the graphics driver to rectify what it thinks is a problem. You'd hope that Numba would be aware of that and dispatch code appropriately but c'est la vie. I guess I'm going to have to do some nitty gritty to dispatch things manually.
Write code functionally as much as possible. Global variables or class attributes in your functions should be exceptional situations. Also, learn virtualenv
better than what?

Also came here to say this. The abilities for slicing data and embedded plotting are wonderful.
HIGH DEF ASS FUCKING!
Pythonic is Pythonic, imo. Follow what the language is designed to do, keeping in mind that we are all consenting adults. This may mean documentation (which python facilitates with features like docstrings) plays a more crucial role. This is distinctly different from patterns such as "self-documenting code through very verbose code" (looking at you, Java people). Python is closer to Ruby than it is to Java. Ducktyping and monkeypatching are the name of the game. Developers can feel free to switch to another language (Go? Julia?) if they need more type safety. Not to mention the adoption of duck typing by other languages is making inroads (for example, dynamic objects with introspected methods in .NET CLR (basically calling a method on a dynamic object checks at runtime whether the object supports the method. It's still a bit clunky, as you have to manually throw the equivalent AssertionError)). Finally, from a performance perspective, if you are not using/exploiting duck typing in Python, you're completely paying the overhead of runtime type resolution without reaping any benefit from it.
Yes, it's a symptom I am seeing more of with gaps between CS, Math and "IT" education, IMO. But of course, as usual, the Orwell principle applies: once you master the rules you'll know how to properly break them.
I don't think that is what they meant. It's saying all the algorithms that will be discussed here will have accompanying python code python. It's not an uncommon colloquialism.
For others facing same problem I found this and it solved it: https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_core/issues/127 https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/issues/636

You could also go straight to the source and use the reference python Argon2 library, since it's widely becoming the recommended password hashing function https://pypi.org/project/argon2/

Take a look at an ongoing project on github or bitbucket and volunteer to help out? Always the best way to learn new things and build that CV.
English is probably not their first language. In the English-speaking world, the phrase "All Algorithms Implemented in python" directly means "every algorithm that currently exists is implemented in this python repository." To get the meaning you suggest, it would have been titled "Many Algorithms Implemented in Python"
Plotting library in Python that produces interactive, JavaScript, plots. Nice if you like to code in Python over JavaScript - and great for integration into online dashboards/websites.

Again, as a novice, what are they called? What's best in your opinion? How are they better than matplotlib etc. etc.?
I dabble in python here and there. Nothing serious. With all the Powerball/Mega Millions craziness going on, I decided to write a script that stores my yearly powerball numbers, check them against the latest numbers every release, and then send me an email when I've won something. I have this running on a raspberry pi and scheduled to run every wednesday and saturday after the numbers are drawn. I know this is a pretty simple little project, but it was an accomplishment for me.
That's awesome, thanks! 
I don't know - maybe someone else can chime in. I've actually used plot.ly and really enjoyed it but haven't tried bokeh since much earlier in it's development when it was much less mature. Might be time to check it out again myself.
Probably a stupid question to ask but does this mean I can utilize python directly to incorporate Microsoft's Cognitive services directly? Sorry for the noob question, I'm just getting into programming, beginning with Python, and we're a Microsoft shop and all of these items were shown to me the other day and I was kind of thinking I should be getting up to speed with C# or C++ if it's easier for us to integrate these items in an enterprise environment. (Side note: the reason I went with Python was due to it coming across as a fairly beginner friendly language and it also seemed to be the choice language when looking up ML/DL/AI walkthroughs) 
When you hear "deployment" and "python" in the same paragraph most people are already talking about Ansible. There are also some other tools like Ansible worth researching. &amp;#x200B; Doing this work home-built scripts is definitely the old, janky, sucky way to do this. (Not surprised that a school is going that route.)

Security related? pls, Goo ooon…. 
I mean you can just label yourself not and type the messages yourself done ez
What’s the tradeoff?
How does it compare to matplotlib? Would I ever prefer it other than when i want to render in JS? 
I don't know the answer to that specific question, but I can state that as of the time of this release, Bokeh has about 600K conda+pip package installs per month, 8300 stars on GitHub, and 321 total contributors to date. It is an active and widely used project.
Saving this...Thanks!
you can still use supervisor to manage a python 3 app.
I agree that duck typing is definitely still considered pythonic. Monkeypatching is not pythonic or recommended anymore. It hasn't been the name of the game since 2.6. &amp;#x200B; But languages evolve over time and what's idiomatic evolves with the language. Python 3 has already adopted type hinting, and there is no way in hell that the core team is going to introduce a formally broken typing system. That means that LSP is going to be a thing, and if people are checking types, mypy is \*always\* going to throw when it sees those violations. &amp;#x200B; No one says you have to use any of this. But if you are going to (sounds like you aren't), then the language will insist that you use it correctly. Duck typing isn't going anywhere in Python though. &amp;#x200B; As for performance, that was never the question, and duck typing was never a singularly important benefit. There's a whole host of things that dynamic type resolution gives you; that's just one. And language performance is generally a pointless thing to talk about. It mostly doesn't matter. What matters is developer performance. Saying that you give up language performance for no benefit is a really, really weird argument. &amp;#x200B; The point here is that with type hinting and analysis, Python gives you some of the safety it has been lacking and that is genuinely a good idea--maybe even necessary--in designing large applications and frameworks. That doesn't mean that \*you\* have any need for it. Probably 95% of professional python developers don't need it. Maybe more? Maybe 99%? I dunno. But it's most of them. So don't use them. But arguing that they are unpythonic is weird now that type hinting is a part of python core. &amp;#x200B; The thing I would reiterate is part of what I mentioned in my first post. Types != Classes. Nothing has changed about how classes work or how you can or should use them. The only thing that brings a change is invoking type hinting and the underlying type safety system, and if you're going to do that, it's obvious that you should do it correctly. You obviously have no obligation to do any of it though. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
Is this library more used than plotly? Is this library, that has just released version 1.0, more used than plotly? Is this library, which is not developed by a corporation with an incentive to spread understanding, knowledge, and technical expertise about their product, more used than plotly? Is this library, that has been around for far less than plotly, more used than plotly? no.
Looks like an awesome project! Something similar to [d3js](https://d3js.org/), but letting us do the coding in python, not javascript directly. Kudos to this team!
It's several years ago and I am not sure if I remember correctly, but I think that plotly was not always open source, and after the first month(s) / year, they added some annoying restrictions which caused a lot of people jumping ship -- probably the same time when bokeh came along and became popular. Now, it seems plotly is again the more popular lib for interactive viz (I am usually a matplotlib person, so I didn't follow it that closely)
Most of the sentences above are false. Bokeh and Plotly were started around exactly the same time. For almost all of that time Bokeh received the vast majority of its institutional support from Anaconda, Inc. (who created and provide the free Anaconda distribution which has millions of users) as well as from a multi-year DARPA XDATA Initiative grant early on. 
Is this homework? &amp;#x200B; [https://www.reddit.com/r/homework](https://www.reddit.com/r/homework)
No it’s not
Thanks, but one question : is there some sort of API of controlling our service? I mean, if you need to stop it, or restart it... Or it just runs python.exe when start is requested and kills process, when stop has been requested?
With a loop, recursion could also be used. 
Btw, i found it out, everything is written [here](https://nssm.cc/usage). 
I just think it's sort of sad that more and more of what developers hated about statically typed languages (again, Java, C++ and friends) is seeping into a language that was designed to break those paradigms. The price of "enterpriseyness" I suppose (but isn't the whole point of language development supposed to _reduce_ bureaucracy, not create more?). As much as I'd like to blame people who learned Java in CS 101 for this, it's the fundamental probably with CS 101 that's really caused this to happen (where CS 101-Python instructors were themselves former CS 101-Java instructors)...The last thing I need in my life are lazier developers. Traditionally, (C)Python has been regarded as slow (as compared to other bytecode interpreted languages), primarily because of runtime type checking. So my point is if you're not using duck typing/relying on runtime type resolution, then you're getting the slowdown for no benefit. The only thing I can see in terms of language evolution is perhaps in Python 3.8 or 4 or whatever, that statically typed code gets resolved to actual C or Java types for performance (which is why people started using NumPy, Jython, and PyPy to begin with). &gt; Types != Classes. Not sure what you mean by this. Pretty much everything typable in Python is a class or exposes a class-like interface by language definition. Type hinting just casts the return of a function to such a abstract-class-like (essentially explicitly asserting a morphism), as a sort of "eh I don't want to use a fullblown abc, but still establish a contract to the caller".
And add to that, a bit of caching. Although, for the list of given values, it doesn't help much.
Finally. 
Oooooooo, interesting!
My best advice to you, as a novice, is that you leanr how to search for things in your own. Seriously.
What should the bot do?
If you are looking for something to code, over in r/JustNoMIL there used to be a bot called Bitchbot that shared a users post history on that subreddit. Heres an example: https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/9hdvuy/witchbitch_thinks_its_appropriate_to_talk_to_her/e6b606p/ There was a bit of a fracas recently which involved several mods quitting and one being forced out, but one of the mods who left in protest created that bot so when they left they took their work with them. If you built a new bot there you'd probably get a few gildings out of it
ESTO ES BOKEEEEEE
Seconded. Acquiring appropriate Google-fu is a valuable endeavor.
Bokeh does not use D3; it uses BokehJS, which is its own independent JavasScript library that can be used from other languages like R (see hafen.github.io/rbokeh).
If you have a problem, describe it with details. If your post has tons of people bashing you about you are misleading and not provide enough information, or even lying, just edit and update some more information (how do you manage interpreter, PATH, env, etc.) The problem might be correct and devastating to you, but there is a reason why everybody in this thread is against you.
It's interesting...?
Pm me.
Looking through the history, my impression is that we've just got someone who likes Haskell a little too much trying to reproduce the Haskell solution in a bunch of languages. I could be wrong, but I don't think any automated tool was involved. It doesn't seem in the spirit of the site at all. Strange.
Try the /r/learnpython [learning resources](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/index?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=usertext&amp;utm_name=learnpython&amp;utm_content=t5_2r8ot).
The @ sign designates methods specific decorators. For example, lets say you wanted to make a static method class Math: # constructor def __init__(self, a, b): # sets the instance fields a and b to local a and b self.a = a self.b = b # decorator describes the the method type in this instance, a static method @staticmethod def add(a, b): return a + b def add(self): return self.a + self.b if __name__ == '__main__': math_object = Math(3,4) print(math_object.add()) print(Math.add(4,5)) which prints 7 9 decorators can be used in other instances. I for one use the package python-singleton-decorator all the time, as it provides a readable way to write singletons, by appending @singleton to the top of the class. &amp;#x200B; Hope that helped you.
OS? if Ubuntu, just run `sudo apt-get install python3-pygame python-pygame` else, `pip install pygame` &amp;#x200B;
I'm not sure where to begin. I need to write a script that starts and shuts down the engine and see if it runs correctly. When the engine starts up, it needs to read through our load what's in memory. I need to test that depending on fail over scenarios it responds correctly. Obviously, I would have to have these scenarios set up so I am debating how I should set them up. I guess I should set them up at random so the scripts aren't predictable. I need to build a series of data but make sure the quantity is short. I also would probably need a clean system every time so I'm thinking of cleaning out the DB before I do anything, or just leave it as is. 
I just go to w3schools really. Udemy also offers courses on python and that should give you an idea

You are a piece of work my friend, accusing people without any evidence.
I have added details in my OP.
by reading the sidebar
Wrong sub.
This is similar to fizzbuzz and the way you presented it make me think it is homework. So, no. Not going to do your homework for you.
don't have to be a self righteous bitch about it 
it was for a fucking job, it was time sensitive. fucking sorry. it was the one question i didnt know. 
you should be fine then if that was the only question you didn't know. your personality is a completely different monster though. good luck with the job
Thanks to all for your answers so far. I too had found the particular user who made the edits; reviewed some of his later python additions, and marked a few of the worst for improvement. My googling couldn't find the translation tool, but I still suspect that one may be in development as it looks like automatically converted code. Thanks for your interest ☺️

&gt; Monkeypatching is not pythonic or recommended anymore. It hasn't been the name of the game since 2.6. We call it "decorating" these days. The end effect is more or less the same.
Sure. I just figured there were other novices also reading this who are unaware, so asking in a public forum specifically about the topic is a bit more beginner friendly than trawling through stuff on Google that, in the eyes of a beginner, may or may not be useful. 
It is working, you got to an interpreter prompt. Apparently JDK 9 turned on the warnings by default, but continues to allow the access, with an eye on JDK 10 or later denying access by default. A quick search on the warning contents led to [this open issue](http://bugs.jython.org/issue2656), so it looks like it's being worked on.
Read the Python [library documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html) instead. 
I have read textbooks, cookbooks, guides and bibles. I have taken courses in programming. I have seen all sorts of videos, both free and paid, on the subject. And yes, I have read the documentation. In the end, I wasted a lot of my time and didn't really learn much of anything. Here's what I found truly works. Step 1, read the documentation. Step 2, download an open-source program in whichever language you want to learn. Step 3, pick apart the code and try to understand how it works. You will fail. Step 4, Google everything that you don't know, or are unsure about. Step 5, repeat steps 1-4 until proficient. Step 6, write your own code and have it peer reviewed. Step 7, repeat step 6 indefinitely. I've failed and will continue to fail. Honestly, programming makes me feel stupid. It also makes me feel smart and fills me with pride. And then I'll feel stupid again. Just remember this, failing makes us better. So, ask stupid questions. Write bad code. Get criticized by assholes and take it like a champ. In the end, you'll be better off for it.
PyInstaller' FAQ didn't have anything on that matter, that much is certain.
thanks!
Could bokeh be used with the free version of pythonanywhere? Tried it with 0.13 but failed misreably. 
Yes, you can do this with Python, but it's usually done by generating Shell/PowerShell scripts, that are then sent to machines and executed there. So, it's not that Python script is reconfiguring the system. It's only used to build scripts according to to rules and templates and supervise parallel, remote execution.
[Nuitka](https://nuitka.net/pages/overview.html) doesn't have this problem, but it doesn't produce a single binary executable.
I've been using bokeh for quite a while now and I'm quite happy with it. Especially for interactive data visualization for rapid prototyping inside jupyter notebook/lab. I get asked quite often "wow, those are beautiful plots/interactive graphs, which library do you use?". However, there are some drawbacks one should be aware of, e.g. lack of radial plots and no 3D plotting. Anyway, a big thank you to /u/bryanv_ and the other contributors for the huge amount of work you're putting into this.
watch the video /u/jhermann_ posted above and it will answer those questions. Even just the first 10 minutes should give you an idea.
I have no solution other than to get your executable signed (which seems really hard and costs money) – if anyone has an easier solution I am super interested.
Yeah, that isn't a solution for me, since I sometimes share my exe files with other people who aren't programmers.
You misunderstand me I think. Signing an executable means that you add a hash or something to your executable so that windows and the anti-viruses know who made it (and then hopefully let it through the virus checks. This still means you distribute your exe file. Seems like a real pain unless its part of a business though. See [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/252226/signing-a-windows-exe-file) for more info.
I'll check this one out later
I get it, it's just that my progs are so tiny that signing them that way just isn't worth it.
Yup, totally agree.
Startup time -- especially when measured using human observation -- has very little to do with the language, and almost everything to do with what actually needs to be accomplished to get your program from not-running to ready-to-work. And Python isn't necessarily _slow_, it's just necessarily _slower_.
Many applications use Python as a glue language (that's what it was intended for). The heavy stuff is written in C or C++ as modules and Python only does lightweight logic. Blender, Sublime Text and others, like GIMP for example, use Python the other way - as an extension language: most of the logic is in C/C++ and only few things are done with Python (plugins, extensions). You can speed up your Python programs by moving computation-heavy stuff to C modules. If you have lots of I/O, concurrency can also help significantly. Profiling should show you choke points and delays in code. Optimize wisely. There might be a point, where you cannot make it any faster. That's a sign you should switch to compiled language entirely. C and C++ are obvious choices, but if you don't like them, Go is also great (it's like C on steroids, but with modern syntax and somewhat influenced by Python... among others).
How do I put this? Get used to it. You're using an ad hoc backdoor that creates a from-the-AV-vendor-POV very sketchy "EXE" file that's actually just an arbitrary zip payload with a bootloader shim... it looks like a Trojan because it basically is one, just a purportedly non-nefarious one. Which anyone can use to build nefarious files that _should_ be flagged by an AV, and which would look practically identical to your safe coils that shouldn't. If you don't sign the resulting EXE then it's a tossup at best whether it gets past any given AV's current definitions, definitions which will change often multiple times per day. If you do sign it then you'll have to submit and resubmit any false positives, then wait. Then start the whole process again for every new version you release in which anything significant changes, including changes in the Python version or the PyInstaller bootloader. If the people you're distributing to don't have admin access and know how to whitelist your work, then prepare for Fun.
A little bit more overhead if you want to do really simple stuff. But for that you get interactive html plots which you can open without needing to re-run a script. There are also much nicer interactive features. For instance, using its box selection feature I was able to make a small tool to select regions in the plot and do some statistics on the points. It also makes it easier to share results with people who aren't familiar with matplotlib. You can save bokeh plots along with the raw data and people can just open the html. 
Hoo boy, sounds like fun, for sure! 😄
PMOTW! :) They even have Py3 now. https://pymotw.com/3/

Wow, thank you for this informative comment. The sources you mentioned are really interesting, I will be researching stuff further. Also, good point on Python intentionally ignoring LSP.
[Here you go.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)
Thanks. Duck typing and mypy's/typing's protocols are on my _blog post ideas_ list ;)
Which course are you doing please?
I’m super new to this; how hard would it be to write a programme that issued minor insults to a colleague when they double booked in an outlook work diary? 
Perhaps a solution (second message): [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43777106/program-made-with-pyinstaller-now-seen-as-a-trojan-horse-by-avg](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43777106/program-made-with-pyinstaller-now-seen-as-a-trojan-horse-by-avg) &amp;#x200B;
And to add I think bokeh is the Python plotting library with the more structured organization in terms of traditional hierarchical classes, close to classic Object Oriented P, which things like Matplotlib tend to evade and which I personally dislike. It breaks the order and I like order.
Yeah that pywin32 is what I'm looking for. It's just that resources to learn it as a complete beginner to shell extensions does not exist, at least when learning with Python.
Atom is a huge application, and slow as fuck, compared to ST because ST was written with performance and efficiency in mind, while Atom was written by developers who care about neither of those things. ST has its own high-performance, OpenGL-based, custom editor rendering engine. Atom has a copy of the Chromium web browser. Atom is layers and layers of libraries that only exist to make web stuff work more like desktop stuff, which is why it’s slow as all fuck. Same goes for Slack and very many other Electron-based apps.
I’d be getting data from sensors embedded in concrete pylons (they measure how much the pylons shift underground in this case). The data would be in .csv files in some cases, so file processing would be part of it. I’d then perform math operations on it to pull out information, and then return that to structural/civil engineers in the field using an app. 
You're right, function had to be called with if ___name___=='___main___' Thanks a bunch!

No idea why you're being downvoted for these comments. If you know nothing about packages and visualisation what are you meant to even be searching for? This is the one aspect of software development I've disliked ever since i started learning, even searching for solutions I'll end up on a forum or Reddit post from someone 2 years ago with the same problem being told to Google it. Unfortunately that's just how it is at times, /r/learnpython is more friendly though if you need some help. /r/learnprogramming too. Unfortunately I'm still in my first few months of learning so can't offer much help
Here's a sneak peek of /r/learnpython using the [top posts](https://np.reddit.com/r/learnpython/top/?sort=top&amp;t=year) of the year! \#1: [I made a python cheat sheet](https://np.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/82t191/i_made_a_python_cheat_sheet/) \#2: [2000+ free programming books on github](https://np.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/8ycc5j/2000_free_programming_books_on_github/) \#3: [When I'm coding, I don't feel stupid anymore](https://np.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/989qx7/when_im_coding_i_dont_feel_stupid_anymore/) ---- ^^I'm ^^a ^^bot, ^^beep ^^boop ^^| ^^Downvote ^^to ^^remove ^^| [^^Contact ^^me](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=sneakpeekbot) ^^| [^^Info](https://np.reddit.com/r/sneakpeekbot/) ^^| [^^Opt-out](https://np.reddit.com/r/sneakpeekbot/comments/8wfgsm/blacklist/)
Sounds to me like a problem with the TCL/Tk library rather than Python or Idle. Also try setting/changing language and locale settings (LC_ALL, LANG environment variables etc) in your terminal before launching idle?
&gt; I suppose the convenience is there? Well yeah, that's pretty much a motivation for the module: it's the One Obvious Way to do simple secrets for those who don't know how to do crypto. `secrets` wraps the bits you need, so you don't have to. See [the PEP for the motivation](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0506/).
For the sake of the comparison, how would you use PassLib to provide a secure URL? Say, for a password reset: url = 'https://mydomain.com/reset=' + secrets.token_urlsafe() 
I could try, though it probably would still detect the exe the moment it's installed and run
The evidence is everyone's experienfe in this thread. Whereas i will eat my hat if you can provide a counter, you're not.
I think Altair, Bokeh, Seaborn and Plotly are the best to get started with - Matplatlib is really important, and the basis of some others, but is unintuitive and complex.
Cool, cheers. Think it's worth having a rudimentary understanding of how matplotlib works considering that others are based off it?
What's up with all the scroll bars?
i knew that....but lets say we have 2 elements with the same class....i wanted to say if the tr in td contains EAN, then print me the 2nd td in this tr
This sounds like bullshit... but it’s really not. When I think of all the ‘executives’ I have encountered in the real would whose primary skill was navigating ‘bro-culture’... yea this is all win. Let’s look at it another way. If this were a prerequisite for all executive roles, public and private, we might not have a near illiterate tribal cult leader for a US President. Yea, ‘python’ might seem like a rather arbitrary choice, but it’s accessible enough to be a reasonable minimum standard, and we clearly have no current method to prevent the idiots from assuming control. Why the hell not.
I have gone over multiple projects before making the code look better smaller and overall more efficient. I think it’s great to do that!
I think it's supposed to be like a border style, sure makes it annoying as hell to read though.
I think you should welcome criticism of the question, as it just might tell you much more than a straight up answer, and not assume it arises from lack of understanding. That being said... &gt;on a complex project what is the best practice for laying out blocks of code? This sounds more like a question about software architecture in general than Python architecture. Laying out the high level components isn't really language specific and a reasonably complex project more often than not has parts written in different languages. As for visual representations of complex projects, is [this](https://anvaka.github.io/pm/) in the ballpark of what you're after?
I’m having a little trouble picturing exactly what it is you want - but since it sounds like you’re not looking for a book that has diagrams explaining what lists are vs dicts, I’d recommend Writing Idiomatic Python by Jeff Knupp - it’s pretty well organized and I think he does a good job of explaining why you should or shouldn’t do things the “normal” way. https://jeffknupp.com/writing-idiomatic-python-ebook/ In terms of books that would use a truly visual style to convey the information, the only one I could comment on would be Head First Python — I read HF Java a long time ago and it was very helpful to me. I haven’t used the python book from the series but I think their quality is generally pretty good. I’m not sure if it covers python3 tho, which at this point is a pretty big minus for a python book. 
I believe you could use Nuitka or Cython to compile into an executable or c/c++ source code. Should work for all platforms. 
I'm interested to see how [xray](https://github.com/atom/xray) works out - it's still kind of electron based but a lot of it is built in rust and electron handles none of the server interaction.
I write code to solve problems &amp; automate boring things at work. I improve these all the time when I have a reason or time to tweak them instead of just running/using them. 
The easiest way is to do SAAS software where the user never actually installs your program, they just interact with a server that runs it. Even compilable languages can to decompiled. There are lots of skilled programmers that can reverse engineer programs. You can always use an obfuscator before turning the application into an exe via Nuitka, py2exe, PyInstaller, etc. 
CX_Freeze is another good one to create standalone executables from Python scripts. I use it at work to make internal tools for other employees while only exposing source code to IT for security reviews.
Yes you should! As you learn new things you should go back to old problems and see if you can solve them in a new way. That way, in the future, you'll remember how to approach that problem more effectively
You should make it a site. After you finish the application, make it a Django project. Would love to see that, as I know of no aggregator sites for drm free books.
I think it depends on how much of this kind of work you're doing. If a ton, then yes.

thats the thing, no one here can do that! Most things we do as programmers, we dont know how to do. The job is figuring out how to do them! And then trial and error untill we build what we think we were supposed to build.

It depends on you and how you like to do things. Some folks regularly rebuild the same programs as they progress in their knowledge of the language or ecosystem or learn new languages; others keep building new/different stuff. You do you, literally. Not everybody is motivated by doing the same thing over and over, not everybody is motivated by always trying to find new stuff to do.
It's not expensive and it's fairly easy. 
wow took you what 20 mins ? LOL

Thanks for the double correction! Haven't used RE in a while but any time you reference the same variable twice in one line, something is probably wrong!
Packaging took me forever to figure out, but I just pushed my first package to PyPI. I'm not sure how I feel about wrapping only about 20 lines of code in a package to be honest, but so far I copied them into most of my projects, which isn't great either.
True, all those things would be unsuitable to python. How do you usually prove your software is works as intended?
I just pushed my first package to PyPI: [timethis](https://pypi.org/project/timethis/), a context manager for measuring execution times.
In any folder, but the [`py-trakt-letterboxd-import.py`](https://py-trakt-letterboxd-import.py) and `diary.csv` must be together. Have you installed python in your workstation?
Yeah. I just went to Python.org and installed 3.7.1 I opened it with IDLE and inserted the CLIEN_ID=, CLIEN_SECRECT =, and the CODE = in-between the '' marks. I'm just at a loss on how to execute the next two commands that work with my CSV files
There are systems that can prove the software quality, like SPARK in Ada's world. Ada itself is a language that wouldn't let you shoot yourself in the foot easily, and SPARK can prove it formally. There are some systems that are based on the languages with dependent types like Idris or Coq. But I'm not the one to ask about it, I only know they exists, but never used them.
This website is incredibly painful to read - those scrollbars and insanely small tidbits separated by miles of spaces.
With IDLE open and your file selected, press F5 to execute the entire script
What does that mean? If you are expecting e.g. "show" to open a browser with the HTML output, that can't happen because you are running code on a remote machine (generally true, nothing to do with Bokeh). Otherwise, the mailing list is a good place to ask support questions: [https://groups.google.com/a/continuum.io/forum/#!forum/bokeh](https://groups.google.com/a/continuum.io/forum/#!forum/bokeh)
Dammit...
Stop doing this. Stop making 20 lines of python packages. Have we learnt absolutely nothing from the javascript community?
Windows? Linux? Mac?
Is there a way to read these on mobile, not as json? 
Mac
It's worth taking a moment to evaluate whether it actually matters if users have access to the source code - what are you actually trying to protect against? If your concern is someone stealing your software and redistributing it. copyright is your best defense. This is true whether your code is compiled or not - compiled binaries can also be redistributed. Hiding the code doesn't really make much difference here. If your concern is security, it's pretty widely acknowledged that hiding your code is counterproductive. Publicly auditable code is much more secure than secret code. If your concern is individual users modifying the source code for their own personal use... why is that a concern? I mean for liability reasons you might want a license that forbids it, but at the end of the day, if your users find a way to make your product more useful to them, that's a win for you. I'm not going to say there are never situations where it actually makes sense to worry about hiding source code, but I do think people tend to worry about it far too much. For the most part, there are no secrets in there that anyone would care to steal. You do have an investment in labor to protect, but on that front, legal protections are much more effective and useful than technical protections.
Yeah, I use --onefile. Will check if default compilation works.
The commands you need are: * ls Used for listing directories and files in the current folder * cd (Change Directory) is used to travel around the directories &amp;#8203; cd .. To go back one directory cd Directory To enter a directory named Directory If you just type cd, the command is going to enter the home directory of your system, like C:\\Users\\UserName in windows, /home/username in Linux You can use the key TAB on your keyboard to autocomplete the names in case you are having troubles
&gt; Is it worth re-doing the same projects if you look close enough, you will often see room for improvement at least you may do some refactorings, maybe switch to using other libraries
Going by the solution to the very first question, I gather this is focused on Java only?
once you picked up the basics, whenever you want to start a project, reach the community and ask which libraries/tools you must use. you will get valuable feedback and save a lot of time by doing this
Why do the solutions (I only checked the first few) all link to Java code?
yep, ansible is great for this at least for unix-like systems
Who is upvoting this nonsense? Topicality aside, here's an interview tip: if someone asks you questions like these, _walk out_.
lmao in the header image there is a picture of standard data structures... and then a dataframe... this is idiotic.
Rewrite the code in C++. Really Python exist for clear readable code, if you don’t want somebody to read your code then Python is the wrong language. 
This deserves to be engraved in a stone somewhere.
ahh okies. :)
When using the requests library, you just do `response.json()`.

About an hour, but I noted the API was built with swagger so I took the json by inspecting the docs page in chrome then used it to generate the function prototypes. I added some regex magic to parse the urls and convert to the format string. The longest part was making the file pep8 which I started by running it through autopep8(pip install autopep8). Then I fixed the rest by hand. I tested a few calls in ipython and did a python setup.py bdist_wheel upload to push to pypi. Just when you thought no one was watching the timestamps ^this guy proves you wrong.
Refactoring old code is good, when it's reasonable to do so. Writing new code is good, when there's a need to do so. Using /r/learnpython is the best thing to do.
Hey Nate, just dropping in to say that portswigger/burpsuite is a godsend to the community. Many thanks for all the great work.
I've seen that picture before too. It doesn't even make sense in-context. It's just a bad diagram.
Alright, so I finally see what he's doing. He wants to convert the matrix we have in to one in which the main diagonal is zero. Then we add back in the Identity matrix .. so we are back where we started. The advantage of this is that then I can adjust the values for whichever nodes I want to make more important by simply changing the 1 in the Identity matrix to whatever we want (5, 10, or 20). I think the first code you gave me would do this - but you overwrote it. Any chance you can give this one quick look for me ... (I have to hand it in 2.5 hrs). If I can get the supernodes working how he likes I should be sweet. 
No I haven't learned, educate me. What happened to the javascript community?
Is anyone here being unhelpful? The other response linked to a full conference talk that largely answers your very general question. And when you asked it again, I replied trying to help you understand that when you ask such a general question, the answer is "it really depends". So you are setting up a situation where are asking another person to do all the work. i.e., for them to imagine all the different kinds of things you might \*really\* be trying to accomplish (but haven't stated), and to give one answer that covers all those different unknown possibilities into account. That's alot of work, a full conference talk amount of work, in fact! People with experience want to help novices (at least I do), and the best way to get them to, is to help them, by asking questions that are as focused or contextual as possible. Context and focus the things that actually allow them leverage their experience to help you as quickly and directly as possible. \[1\] &amp;#x200B; \[1\] And just in case it's not evident, because screens of text are often unclear in just this way, the intended tone of this post is "kind encouragement", not "admonishment"
If you need some help with beta testing I would be happy to run a testsuite through it and compare. P.S. I'm not using it for pentesting so it's not an automatic purchase.
Alongside with bots, people in general have the habit of voting (and commenting) entirely on the title and not check out the article itself. In this case, users see datastructres and think yes that subject is important and upvote for visibility. 
I can't remember exactly what code that was, and I stored in a temp which is gone now. However, given what I wrote above I can deduce one of two things # add one node and connect it with all orthers superNode = 100 superInfluence = 20 graph.add_node(superNode) [graph.add_edge(superNode, node, weight = superInfluence) for node in graph.nodes()] 
 if e.code == 401: print 'CODE maybe wrong / already used?' raise Exception("OAuth must be provided") The code you are working with is very old (from 2015), so the API that [Trakt.tv](https://Trakt.tv) provides must have changed. This means the code needs some tweaks
Confusing part for beginners I think is when you throw HoloViews / PyViz into the mix which are made by the same contributors IIRC as Bokeh or are all mentioned together in the documentation. For exploratory data analysis, PyViz provides a more efficient workflow. If you want total control and flexibility, then it's Bokeh which of course has a lower level, higher learning curve API as a result of that flexibility. I haven't checked out Bokeh version 1.0 so maybe they've incorporated higher level APIs, but this is my understanding so far. I've been using Plotly with cufflinks since I am a heavy pandas user. I'll have to revisit Bokeh again or PyViz.
Depending on how long you are waiting for data, the select method might work. It let's you listen for when a particular set of file descriptors have data ready to process, and then handle it. I'm not sure if it's available on all platforms, or only Unix based, but it will let you manage things in a single thread. Python has a GIL, so only one thread can actually run python code at a time. Multi processing may be too expensive. NodeJS performs fairly well using a single threaded model, so the select approach could work best. 
Nah, I can't add in a node. I have to change the value of one of the others. I just noticed the code you offered when you helped me with noise. I think that's what I'm after. Get the graph, create the matrix missing the main diagon, add in the Identity matrix, then change the value for the nodes I want to be influencers. Thanks again for looking though. Wish I save some of your earlier code, I have shitloads of scripts everywhere, mustn't have saved it. 
If you want to keep using the Bokeh "stack", there's HoloViews/PyViz for a higher level API.
Depends on what your use case is, really. For example, how long are each of your request jobs going to take? What is more important, system resource usage or overall execution time? With multiprocessing, you can limit the number of parallel processes by using a pool instead of spinning one up. The very first code example [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html) shows you how. There's not an explicit thread pooler in Python2, but you could maybe use the accepted answer [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3033952/threading-pool-similar-to-the-multiprocessing-pool) and [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46045956/whats-the-difference-between-threadpool-vs-pool-in-python-multiprocessing-modul). Python3 has a ThreadPool "built-in" [here](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/concurrent.futures.html?highlight=concurrent%20futures#threadpoolexecutor). You could also use `celery` or another task queue framework to do pretty much the same thing as all of the above, but involves more setup and knowledge of those tools. I would avoid Twisted and Tornado for the same reason. If *I* were to do it, I'd probably just do it with both a multiprocess pool and a thread pool, and then compare the performance based on some real-life-mimicking set of requests. 
Whoops
He went through the book mentioned in the article (Cracking the Coding interview, which I just recently bought and am working my way through) and literally ripped out questions almost verbatim and linked to solutions from wherever. It's some really serious garbage, and the mods should take it down. &amp;#x200B; The book, by the way, is really good interview prep if you need to review (or learn) these algorithms, in spite of it being in Java.
Oof...definitely don't know how to do that
I'd say if you touch the code and you don't like it refactor, if it's working and needs no maintenance your time is better spent learning new techniques and solving new problems. Example, I was added to a "fire fighting/tiger" team where I worked on several different products, every day was solving new problems I hadn't faced before. My growth during this time was phenomenal, I went from knowing some of core python to almost all of it and multiple different libraries UI/web browsing/scraping/API design/website design/cryptographic libs/ssh/queues/remote windows/many DBs etc. It's a huge world keep learning.
I feel like there's already some sort of timing module included with the default Python.
I kind of take your point, but it's also an indictment of the poor state of AV software and why most people should only be running Defender rather than third party stuff like Avast.
PSA - My words are not directed specifically towards you or your project. The JS ecosystem filled with packages that do this one little itty bitty thing because JS isn't exactly a batteries-included language (like python). This leads to npm having to literally download thousands of packages for a relatively simple project. (https://imgur.com/lrgCHVu) I find your package useful, sure. But the fact that I can just write 15-20 lines of code to do this job -- It would be arguably better for me to just write it myself than to use it from a (potentially) unreliable source. And then there's the fact that, profilers do this job of timing stuff a lot better -- You should probably just be using those if you're having to time your code repeatedly.
&gt; Packaging took me forever to figure out, Yes, this is very true. Had a similar experience when I was starting out.. You should check out [this](https://github.com/kennethreitz/setup.py) project that has made packaging a lot easier for me.
Ah wait I remember that you also need to include the nodes own state in the update? I was under the impression the node's own state is not included in the update. Then the identity matrix approach will produce erroneous results However you seem to be on the right track, any other bottlenecks that needs solving? &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
For start just get acquainted with establishing a db connection through Python, and then querying/storing results onto a data structure. The rest is just flow. It shouldn't be that much more different from that of a procedural SQL script; only that you are doing so through Python.
Not absolutely required but helpful to know, gotcha~ Thank you for your input! 
Yeah, there's a lot of moving parts there. The warnings started in 9, the bug for the illegal access warnings is only in regards to 9; if 10 changed default behavior to block instead of merely warn I would not expect Jython to keep up with that backwards-incompatible change until at least 2.7.2, but that's apparently been "about to drop" for more than two years. The only workaround any of the bugs seem to suggest is the obvious one, downgrade the JRE to 8.
Here's the code I've used to get answers for part one ... import networkx as nx import numpy as np from numpy import random, tanh, zeros from matplotlib.pyplot import subplots, colorbar from matplotlib import pyplot as plt #imports python plot s = 0.5 NOISE=0.05 np.random.seed(2) num_sims=1 t_init = 0 t_end = 4 N = 1000 ### Compute 1000 grid points dt = float(t_end - t_init) / N y_init = 0 def dW(D): """Sample a random number at each call.""" return np.random.normal(loc = 0.0, scale = np.sqrt (NOISE)) ts = np.arange(t_init, t_end, dt) ys = np.zeros(N) ys[0] = y_init for _ in range(num_sims): for i in range(1, ts.size): t = (i-1) * dt y = ys[i-1] ys[i] = NOISE*dW(dt) def update(graph, state, func): newState = {} for node in graph.nodes(): newState[node] = func(node, state) return newState # define some update function func = lambda x, state: \ tanh(state[x] + s*(sum(state[xi] for xi in graph.neighbors(x))) + ys[i]) # define graph init state graph = nx.grid_2d_graph(3,3, periodic=True) pos = dict( (n, n) for n in graph.nodes() ) labels = dict( ((i, j), i * 10 + j) for i, j in graph.nodes() ) state = {node : random.randn() for node in graph.nodes()} T = 250 # simulation steps results = zeros((T, graph.number_of_nodes())) for ti in range(T): state = update(graph, state, func) # update state results[ti] = list(state.values()) # append # plot results fig, ax = subplots() h = ax.imshow(results.T) plt.title("Additive Noise " + str(NOISE) + " Coupling 0.5") ax.set_ylabel('Node i'); ax.set_xlabel('Time [t]') colorbar(h, ax = ax, label = 'value') Is it possible to amend this so rather than state I have [A+I], where a = nx.adj_matrix(graph), and I=np.identity(9) ??? If I can do that I'm golden, if not I'm not sure how I rebuild. 
Can we get more details? "download its free" just isn't a very moving argument.
It Python 3 essential course which have 50+ videos to learn python basics 
I would recommend learning Apache Airflow which is an open source Python Framework for doing ETL. This framework is becoming popular in the data engineering community and familiarity with it can you teach you a lot about common tasks. &amp;#x200B; In my opinion it's much better to do a project than to take a course. A course will provide you with abstractions but ETL is all about trying to organize messy data in the real world. One idea from a project is to scrape a webpage store it in a database, then create aggregate and derived tables that convey some higher level reporting. The key to actually doing this is to pick something you find interesting. If you like sports then scrape a sports website. So using airflow you scrape a page, insert it to Postgres, make some roll up tables. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
So you mean to say, somebody with an industry experience of 15 years in C++ will not be able to understand code written in C++ ?
Yeah, that's certainly along the lines of what I was thinking. Let me have a go playing with it and see if I can smush it in to the code I'm using. Probably not, but i'll give it a go. 
&gt;1. Make sure you have Python3, Firefox and Xvfb installed on your system. This project is designed to run on Linux. =/
It's hard for me to tell what the end goal is but I think you should be nearly there :)!
Nope didn’t say that at all. Please read my post again. If you don’t want your CUSTOMER reading your code my point is that Python is the wrong language right from the start. There are good reasons for making it difficult for your customers to read your code. I’m not sure if the original poster has a good reason but that isn’t really what was asked. In any event C++ is just one language that can be used to create executables and keep the source code from your customers. By the way the. I’m on reasons for keeping the source from your customers doesn’t mean much for me. It is however a big problem if there is potential liability that you may take on if the customer modifies your code. Now this doesn’t mean that a customer couldn’t modify your executable in someway but in doing so he is far more liable than harm done due to scripting code being modified. 
No need for servers either, see www.zappa.io
Looking pretty good, now I just need to add in code I had before to change noise and coupling and I'm done. Thanks again. Hopefully I can smash all this out in the next hour. Fingers crossed. Thank you. 
*Which* Python 3 Essentials Course? Or is this something you cooked up yourself?
Maybe the bots are written in python? 
Wow, my respect boy!.
Shit, I need to add coupling back in ... Like we had here : tanh(state[x] + couples*(sum(state[xi] for xi in graph.neighbors(x))) + ys[i]) How do I do that? 
Reinstalled Python3 before running. Installing Firefox now. Xvfb is the only one I don't know how to install on MacOS
Get bit
Haha quite a selling point for Python

I fix the issue, thanks for reporting it
Hi, I add your game to my steam wishlist, probably I will buy it soon.
Sure. I can see that. However if ocr extracted text is something like this "as pictur plu5 ?hd cinma". And actual texts are: "zee cinema HD plus' and "star plus hd". Then in this case desired output is "zee cinema HD plus" because it should match three words "plu5" as "plus", "?hd" as "hd", "cinma" as "cinema". How can it be approached?

But, if there are efforts to make Atom faster and sleeker than they **do** care about performance and efficiency.
Just to be a party pooper ... I assume you are not aware that Python know the emojis by name: &gt;&gt;&gt; '\N{FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY}' '😂' The \N escape have been supported since python3.3 
So I tried PySpellChecker `for word in spell.unknown("as pictur plu5 ?hd cinma".split()): print word, spell.correction(word)` And the results: &gt;?hd phd &gt; &gt;cinma cinema &gt; &gt;plu5 plus &gt; &gt;pictur picture &amp;#x200B; Zee and HD aren't in the standard English corpus so they wouldn't be resolved correctly and that's expected. You can always add your custom words to the corpus and hopefully these words would be caught/corrected. &amp;#x200B;
Depends on the type of application. If it's a desktop app, I honestly don't know. For webapps, if I was the customer, I would expect to install via pip. If you target less technical customers, a Docker image would be easy. Don't worry to much about your customers having access to your code. Most will never look at it, and even fewer would try to modify or steal it. There's no reason to use an open source licens if it's a commercial product and it gives you a way to go after anyone who do steal your code, if it becomes an issue.
I would suggest compiling with Cython. It may require some slight changes to your build system but the C it generates is plenty obfuscated. 
I've had lots of trouble finding one that works too, I know PIL works for reading, but in terms of writing maybe try Pyxif if you haven't already done so. 
Have you tried [this approach](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44636152/how-to-modify-exif-data-in-python)?
Awesome. Thanks alot. 
Made a text application to interact with the NHL API. I'm learning Flask to upload it to the site
There is a brilliant series of blog posts I would recommend (3 total) that overview getting started with data engineering focusing on Airflow: https://medium.com/@rchang/a-beginners-guide-to-data-engineering-part-i-4227c5c457d7
Great Library! Thanks for the post!
Read this doc to understand the file formats used in the available structured data: https://www.sec.gov/files/aqfsn_1.pdf It will be much easier than attempting to scrape
Since further updated to include Python type annotations by me.
Hmm. Sounds like a combination of sensible ideas (use Rust, not JS) and the same old “I’m a web developer and have almost no idea about anything else” crap (they think HTML is the only worthwhile cross-platform GUI and that everybody knows JavaScript). 
As for what that coupling was, I haven't a clue. I know in earlier questions it was a way of coupling two systems together, so I think it was just a strange way of weighting the network, but it seemed to me that if everyone had the same weight then there was no point changing it ... who knows, given I never got it to work I guess I'll never know. 
If you're going to be mainly living in SQL-land, [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) is also an infinitely useful library, since it abstracts out data access across different DBs into two layers: a generic table object layer and a more full-blown [ORM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping). This lets you worry less about how to actually connect to a DB and more on Pythonizing the values returned from queries. Generally, ETL flows consist of a 3 main metadata structures: an Input configuration/schema, a mapping, and an Output schema/configuration. A loop or series of loops are executed that read data from the input side, transform it via the mapping, and write it to the output side. All flows are built from this basic pattern by chaining outputs as inputs to another mapping. More sophisticated flows might involve multiple inputs and/or multiple outputs. But the key here is reading some data, loop through that data, transforming and mapping it to the output structure, and writing it back out. The transformations themselves are usually implemented as user-defined functions that can be as simple as changing data types to text manipulation to opening another database connection and doing some other data interaction, before returning with the value that corresponds to the value's representation in the output schema.
&gt; Publicly auditable code is much more secure than secret code. I know what you mean, but this isn't logical. Publicly auditable code might be terribly insecure. You need the right people to look at it, inform the author, and for the author to know how to fix it, and fix it, a release a better version. Just making the code public doesn't make any of that happen.
I'm far from an expert, but it looks to me like any element of the set that is matched isn't used in a later match. &amp;#x200B; `&gt;&gt;&gt; x = 'ABCDEF'` `&gt;&gt;&gt; y = 'ABBCDEF'` `&gt;&gt;&gt; longestSubstring(x, y)` `[Match(a=0, b=0, size=1), Match(a=1, b=2, size=5), Match(a=6, b=7, size=0)]` `['BCDEF']` `['BCDEF']` &amp;#x200B; `&gt;&gt;&gt; x = 'ABCDEF'` `&gt;&gt;&gt; y = 'ABBCCDE'` `&gt;&gt;&gt; longestSubstring(x, y)` `[Match(a=0, b=0, size=2), Match(a=2, b=4, size=3), Match(a=6, b=7, size=0)]` `['AB', 'CDE']` `['AB', 'CDE']`
I second the whole project approach. ETL is about data integration: taking data from one source, munging it if necessary and writing it somewhere else so someone or some other system can read it. Some of the simplest ETLs are DB-to-DB or DB-to-file or file-to-DB and I'd probably start there, since the transformations are usually pretty straight forward (db-to-db the source db can do almost all the heavy lifting in the SQL query, for example). About 80% of my job consist of supporting people loading flat files like Excel into a data warehouse, they can then run SQL queries in the warehouse to do some analysis, then extract the results back to Excel.
yes, that is the doc I was reading from I wasn't able to understand it
Zappa is a tool to manage configuration of aws "serverless" services. It's aws that makes money by providing these services.
right, I understood it wrong, sorry
It is, but there's a couple of additional issuse: 1. You'll need to really follow the installation directions carefully. It's not going to be vanilla Python, you'll most likely be grabbing Ana/Mini/Conda and friends, which will install python and the required bits, instead of just jumping in with Python. 2. You do lose some of the benefit of learning data transformation/structures first principles, which is required for later productionalization. (i.e. where not everything needs the overhead of Pandas).
I use concurrent.futures
Write new code, refactoring takes a lot of time that you do not have to spend. You can be on one(or a few more) codebase and refactor to your hearts content(or disgust) when you make it your job :)
I worked with a guy in the past who managed to decompile Fortran code and make sense of it. I had written a parser for the output file that did the exact same thing as his code, but was written in Python and I was exactly able to reproduce the compiled code's answer. We were able to independently show that the technical support guy (who could give us his compiled code that proved some capability, but apparently not the source?) was just not aware of what his code did. In another case, I was trying to plug into some python code and had pycs. Running decompyle6 gave me a buggy version of the original code (mainly due to excessive globals and hacks to sys.path), but enough to write an interface.
OpenSSL heartbleed 
case in point: OpenSSL.
You missed a scenario: The code is ugly, buggy and barely covers the requirements, and if the customer would look at the actual mess he payed money for, he would demand a refund.
I want to ask the reverse question. I'm a python programmer and bioinformatician looking to get into a MSc of Data Engineering (my focus is to integrate omics data from public platforms). Could anyone recommend me any resources??
Just got "python crash course" for my Bday, I'm working on figuring out matplotlib and json. Just interested in data visualization, mainly for fun! :)
I love this idea! Actually want to implement something like this myself. Any good resources out there for beginners trying to build this?
Stones erode. Best bet is engraving onto a Nokia. 
I habe mainly been using Beautiful Soup and Matplotlib tbh. I have been mostly just experimenting with then and seeing what works as a sort of rough guide before I eventually create a full blown implementation with a GUI. As for resources for a beginner I reckon checking out some tutorials on Beautiful Soup would be a good place to start. Beautiful Soup allows you to retrieve the HTML code of a site and format it and similar stuff. Might be a good place to start :)
I love python, but I think something like [exiftool](https://sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/) might be better for this job. [Here are some tips.](https://arslan.io/2018/04/18/tips-tricks-to-batch-edit-exif-metadata-of-photos/)
Hey thanks a bunch! Best of luck on your project!
This isn't a freelance sub, and even if it was I wouldn't really expect people to be doing things for free very often.
No problem thank you! I hope your implementation goes well!
Hmm... Maybe you want something like this? for row in arrayOne: print (set(row).difference(set(arrayTwo)) &amp;#x200B; This will show you all the elements which are in your row but not in the arrayTwo
&gt;print (set(row).difference(set(arrayTwo)) Thank you u/VoidCap i tried that just now and got a `TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'`
Probably want to use the `any` operator. Either that, or I believe you'd have to iterate over every entry of your 2d list. a = [[4,5,6], [7,8,9]] b = [4,6] for i in b: if not any(i in row for row in a) # Do something print('Something')
Try looking for something like setdiff or anti_join in python. Both are common for this purpose 
&gt; than [sic] they do care about performance and efficiency Yeah, in the same way tractor manufacturers care about top speed.
https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex i'm aware of this to make executable. 
Few different possible ways I guess: &gt;&gt;&gt; r.xpath('//tr[td/strong[text() = "EAN:"]]') [&lt;Element tr at 0x1004d8c00&gt;] &gt;&gt;&gt; r.xpath('//tr[td/strong[text() = "EAN:"]]/td[2]/text()') [' 4048961089302'] &gt;&gt;&gt; r.xpath('//strong[text() = "EAN:"]/../../td[2]/text()') [' 4048961089302']
I'm not sure if this is what you are looking for and I couldn't find a python book that uses it but to me it sounds like [UML ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language) might be (part of) what you are looking for. UML is a unified modelling language used to lay out program structures during planning and there are a couple of books and other resources that could help you get a grasp of its usefulness for your purposes. I think they will cover the visualisation part of your question but I'm not sure if any of the books also cover good design practices. Those might be language or concept specific. 
Ah I see! Hahaha I didn’t realize , like how do I call the functions I defined at the top? Just write in “add()”?
At the end of the day, customer will press a button, see that it works in timely manner, and say, oh well fuck it it works
Yep
Thanks mate !
I would strongly suggest to _not use difflib_ if you are doing science. It has a lot of heuristic and is not made to give you the most correct answer, but if you look at the docs, the one that a human would come up with (from the doc): SequenceMatcher tries to compute a "human-friendly diff" between two sequences. Unlike e.g. UNIX(tm) diff, the fundamental notion is the longest *contiguous* &amp; junk-free matching subsequence See [all the crazyness about difflib](https://matthiasbussonnier.com/posts/08-Dear-DiffLib.html) Also it does not have optimal complexity with some sequences in O(n^3) with the length of the sequence and in some case you can easily get things that go [order of magnitude faster](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Carreau/difflib2.py/blob/master/examples/difflib2.ipynb) (Also contain example of crazy things it does and when it get wrong matches).
Cheers mate! This helps alot!
It works after you have given me advice , Reddit is truly the best!
This is interesting. The way that "blocks of code" are laid out ends up mattering in the sense that "blocks of responsibility" or services/packages are laid out. In the end it really matters what you want to do and most importantly how you want to interact with the code. A good way to start thinking about it is how are your unit tests going to interact with the code? How could you pull each bit in for testing separately. How would a web application call the code? How would you run it on a command line? It all tends to flow from use. Library code will look different still. 
You may also want to check out r/learnpython. As you come up with more questions, it may be that somebody else has already asked!
You guys are lifesavers!
Have you set your language settings, whitelists and all that for your ocr correctly? You might want to preprocess the image as well. That might reduce the garbage a bit.
I wrote a python app to modify EXIF data in a bunch of images. My approach was to use [subprocess.run()](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/subprocess.html#using-the-subprocess-module) to invoke the [exiftool utility](https://sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/) on each file in turn. It wasn't simple at all. Start with the exiftool documentation (above) and work out how to do **one** file from the command line. When you know how that command should look, barring only the filename, then work out a way to automate repeating that command for every file in a directory. You could automate using a shell script, if you were more comfortable with that. But with Python's subprocess module you can compose the command as a string and then execute it.
looking good, https://imgur.com/a/kL90XhK 
Sorry if there's a queue (we're running this on a tiny server). The algorithm certainly isn't perfect and it's a challenging problem to consistently find loops, but we are trying our best to improve it Let us know if you have any suggestions!
Regarding issue 1, you really should be something with something like conda anyway for package and environment management. In that case, the steps are 1) Install Anaconda (or miniconda) if not already installed, and 2) conda install pandas. I've found it to be almost bulletproof, provided your conda installation is fine.
If you want to have some more fun along this same line, check out Goldbach's Conjecture.
I'm deeply impressed by the idea. 
Until Heartbleed, wasn't openssl maintained by like one dude or something crazy? Imagine all the packages that use it...
I'm sure you're right. I'm also sure there's already a proof out there either confirming or denying what I said, but I like writing code in python, so I approached it with python.

Great project. Thanks!
Google is only referring back to these forums where pros answer such questions. So we are doing the groundwork here.
To be honest, I only tried matplotlib - never thought that there could be something better... ;)
I would generally prefer doing new projects. You tend to learn more in the same time - and it's more interesting.
I like this answer! (Premium Upvote)
There is no thing called YouTube-dl and Google keep looking the other way, Than You. 
One suggestion: Look for longer loops (or at least put some kind of filter in your page to filter loops _after_ they've been found.
I would also recommend Effbot and Tutorialspoint as a reference if you just need to know how something works
Why should I use it over `timeit`?
Sounds interesting. Where's the source code?
What do you currently use to find loops? Feature matching?

Oh, "many, many" unnamed frameworks recommend it? Well I'm sold! The competition that selected argon2 doesn't seem to be very well-run to my inexpert eyes. They couldn't even run their own mailing list, having to rely on gmane, which then pulled the plug. (Not just on them: the gmane archives disappeared when the person running it at the time got fed up with the expense and difficulty.) That's a minor sign of unprofessionalism and lack of resources, but if that were the only problem I'd forgive it, easily. But *far* more serious is that they **broke their own rules** of the competition to give argon an advantage: the rules stated that only minor tweaks and bug fixes were allowed between round 1 and round 2, but [argon was replaced with a manjor new implementation](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/48933/why-did-argon2-win-the-phc), argon2, which was then declared the winner. That casts a serious cloud over the result. As the Wikipedia article I already linked to states, there have already been two successful attacks on argon2, and the response of the developers seems to be denial in the second case, merely to say that "its not really a problem". (In fairness, I cannot judge whether they are right or not.) argon2 seems to me to be a classic case of bandwagon jumping. Its "cool" because it promotes resistance against a threat everyone can understand ("brute force attacks using lots and lots of cheap GPUs!") while possibly more important threats are ignored. E.g. it is not very resistant to side-channel attacks. It's not that I have anything specifically against argon2, it seems to be fit for purpose *for what it is* (i.e. no worse than other crypto hashing algorithms), but what I object to is the band-wagon jumping. I suppose that's the consequence of having a "competition" that chooses a single winner, people mistakenly jump to the conclusion that "everyone should use this" when the real lesson is: "The main result of the PHC was not a single new fancy password hashing function (i.e. Argon2), but a massive advancement in the research of password hashing. We understand password hashing and how to do it much better after the competition than we did before it. That's the most important and main result. Examples of this include new security reductions for time-memory trade-offs (Catena) and completely new ideas like workload delegation (Makwa)." [Source](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/39996/does-the-balloon-hashing-paper-deprecate-argon2). In other words, people should be making careful choices of which hash function they use, not just jumping onto the "everyone should use argon2" bandwagon. 
Not sure about your ranking, since some of the "96%" loops are realllly jumpy. Like maybe there are only a small overall percentage of pixels different between end and start, but they're all localized in one spot, making a huge discontinuity in that spot even though the rest of the frame has no discontinuity. I've only had a quick look, but I'd suggest some measure of locality, so that sharp discontinuities that are all grouped together will weigh more. Maybe some sort of summing / reducing convolution over the whole image and taking the max discontinuity metric out of all subregions as your total metric. This way, if the discontinuities are widely spread, you can have a bunch of them and it's ok, but if they're all in one subregion then it makes the whole thing bad. Good work so far, and good luck :)
I see your point, pragmatically. I can't imagine a case where people are thinking "eh i really only needed like &gt;50% of the substrings and I didn't really need all of them, so I'll use this low quality standard library thing where they cut corners in the most popular programming language." This is very icky.

Hmmm, since you have no programming experience, I would start off with learning to use pyodbc or query against a sqlite database. Then progress to ETL frameworks like petl, bonobo, Luigi, or Airflow (I listed them in order of minimalist to heavyweight framework). I think it would be too soon for you to jump into all these frameworks. I would start off basic first.
\[petl\]([https://petl.readthedocs.io/en/stable/](https://petl.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)) &amp;#x200B; But don't you want to learn the basics of Python first ?
I'm in a python class and I'm failing miserably at this week's project. 
Altair is close to a "gg" style API, I don't know what its output story outside the notebook looks like, however. Holoviews also has a very high level "data-exploration" style API, though it is fairly different. But it can output Bokeh output. Bokeh can generate standalone HTML output (e.g. that could be emailed) that can contain various interactive components (hover, linking, custom JS callbacks). I'm not familiar enough with Plotly to comment. 
Shameless plug, [this blog post](http://zulko.github.io/blog/2015/02/01/extracting-perfectly-looping-gifs-from-videos-with-python-and-moviepy/) describes how to find looping gifs in Python using MoviePy. It may or may not be slightly faster as it doesn't require to decompose the video into pictures.
Where do you host these? I would love to learn

already satisfied, Get it. 
So basically you want r/PersonalAutomation ?
You should probably look at Bokeh or Dash.
I suppose so, but more active. If people from this sub aren't interested, I don't think it will go anywhere. I have tried to find other active subs, but they don't seem to exist (or I am bad at finding them). Python automation seems to be the most popular, but I am guessing that many other languages would be on board.
Ok will do. I've used Bokeh just for plots and haven't really looked further into it before. 
A .pyo is a compiled python bytecode file just like a .pyc file. The .pyo file was compiled with optimizations, the .pyc wasn't. They are both python executable files, so what is your actual problem? /r/learnpython is a better place for *questions*, so when you post there you should ask "how do I convert a .pyo file to a .pyc file", which is better than asking if someone can do it for you.
it's because Pandas has a dependency on NumPy which is tightly coupled to C. Not only does it abstract and extend all of the ctypes, but a lot of functions are wrappers to C functions and rely on C libraries that are finnicky to the compiler such as [ATLAS](http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net/) and _its_ dependencies which are also finnicky to the C compiler: BLAS and LAPACK.
This probably won't be pertinent to other users, but I've been a music producer for almost a decade and what got me into programming with python was the ability to expand upon my music abilities and hardware(ie I'm starting to create music controllers with a Raspberry Pi). Using the Mido library, I can send and receive MIDI messages to and from hardware + software. As far as automation goes, it's not full on amation but I have a program I've been making on that makes creating and recording melodies and effects easier. Programming in the way I make melodies, with the click of a few buttons and a couple of parameters I can create an entire melody I have in mind. It can alsp take that melody, or *ANY* MIDI input from my keyboard and do various things with it then dump it in to a DAW. Things like quantization, adding arpeggios, adding aftertouch / velocity, humanization, etc. It saves me a couple of minutes, if I'm trying to do more advanced things it can actually save an hour or more. I know this probably doesn't fit the criteria that you're looking for since I would imagine you're talking about more complete automation, but for me my program does automate a lot of things and saves a ton of time.
I have never thought about this. I can only imagine it would come in handy for alerting. But Airflow integrates well with services like Datadog and Pagerduty. Then the task logs are easily found in the UI. I don't mean to invalidate your question but why do you feel like you need JSON logs?
Thanks for the references.

&gt; There are definitely applications sold to the military. Often times they are just normal applications, but in air-gapped environments w/o connection to the internet. Cloud services don't work. Do you *really* think that militaries don't have their own clouds in this time and age?
I know that you can add a handler and change some configuration of a module's logging instance, but I'm not quite positive with more complex sorts of configurations. Github is being slow but from what I can see there is a configuration module. It would probably be worth digging into that to see if you can just add a custom formatter that outputs valid json such as `logging.Formatter('{"time_stamp": "%(asctime)s", "message": "%(message)s"}')` This is of course a pretty naive example.
There is govcloud, yes. There are other projects that are highly classified. Those networks are air-gapped and in secure facilities. 
That's true, but you can achieve the same thing in fansi with a `:joy:` tag, and if you get your inline unicode name wrong, Python will throw a syntax error. &amp;#x200B; The idea (other than just wanting to understand regex better) was that putting things like Ansi formatting codes and emojis into strings makes them hard to read and quite fragile, and that I'd like to be able to wrap them in markdownesque syntax. &amp;#x200B; That said, I threw it all together in about a day and I'm not satisfied with how it handles emojis. You're right that it probably should insert a \\N character rather than the unicode directly.
You'll have more advices posting in the learnpython section. Then, showing your code will allow people to point out mistakes / best practices.

I don't understand how this happens with such a high profile library. After reading the article I still don't understand how some random person could just add their own files to PyPi's installation.
Dude, no offense, but you are really really far off about the history of Python and its emergence as a reaction against C++, Java, and friends. The fact that you put C++ in the same class as Java is revealing about how goofy your concept is. C++ and Java are two decades apart. Java and Python are 1 year apart. Python wasn't a reaction against "enterprise" garbage design patterns. Nor was it a reaction against statically typed languages. You're imputing intent where there never was any. &amp;#x200B; C++ is from the late 70s. Java's first baby was born in 1991. Python in 1992. &amp;#x200B; The whole concept of enterprise shit didn't even exist when Python was created. You're retconning stuff to suit your ideal purpose, which appears to sound like that totally incomprehensible dude from King of the Hill. "Those got-danged ole young kids just came up in here and told me to put a safety on my full-auto grenade launcher, and that kind of pisses me off because I just want to be able to shoot myself in my foot at 14 grenades per second if I want to." &amp;#x200B; Guess what! You can! No one is changing anything. You can keep doing things exactly as you have always done them, and the language won't stop you. &amp;#x200B; Python is emphatically NOT considered slow compared to other bytecode interpreted languages. It is considered slow compared to other compiled languages. You can't even get this right, but you still maintain the aura of an old sage. And in practice, most of the important parts of the python standard library are already implemented in C, and the libs that people really need to be fast are also implemented either in C or FORTRAN. &amp;#x200B; The singular issue that makes Python slow in CPU-bound ops is the GIL. And most ops are not CPU-bound. They are I/O bound, and the things that are theoretically slow about Python are not--in practice--actually slow. But even that was beside my point. The point is that no one cares about how fast a programming language executes. What people care about is how fast developers can write code that gets a job done. And I don't think there's another language that even comes close to competing with Python for that metric. &amp;#x200B; What do you think NumPy is? Why do you put it in the same category as alternative implementations of CPython? Because that's not what that is. What do you think happens for most of the CPython implementation? I am starting to think you really have no clue and are just throwing words out there that don't make any sense. &amp;#x200B; Yeah, confirmed. My CS101 class has ruined Python for you. I could tell when you don't understand the difference between a class and a type. Honestly, I've never set foot in any comp sci class. I have no idea what they teach in the beginner levels. I did start using Python a couple decades ago, and I've used other languages since then as well. Some of them have good ideas, and I'm glad Python is slowly adopting them. &amp;#x200B; You . . . just don't make any sense to me. Like you're hating the world for taking a class that you never were able to pass or something. I dunno. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
Would you be interested in cacoaster.com and gadgeteer.eu?
You lost all respect there, mate. 
As the article mentions, people register packages with names similar to popular packages in the hope people will mistype the names. pip install jango, etc.
They didn't change the code in the original packages (for example "django") , but instead they created new packages with similar names (for example "diango", "djanga", etc.), copied the code of django there and added the malicious code. So if you misspelled "django" when doing "pip install", you could end up with the malicious package (that worked almost like django but would also steal your passwords and stuff). 
This isn't really a Python question. I think you should find a infosec related subreddit. However, you fail to take into account that the process will be paged out to swap at some point. Mooching through a swap partition or page file is the first stop when trying to recover something interesting from a disk image. 
&gt; That's true, but you can achieve the same thing in fansi with a :joy: tag, and if you get your inline unicode name wrong, Python will throw a syntax error. That error is very explicit in comparison to passing on output with :ojy:, or whatever misspelling is possible for a short word like that. I know it's a matter of personal preference, so there are undoubtedly those that would prefer at mangled text, rather than an error. &gt; The idea (other than just wanting to understand regex better) was that putting things like Ansi formatting codes and emojis into strings makes them hard to read and quite fragile, and that I'd like to be able to wrap them in markdownesque syntax. It must be a generation thing. I'm a certified old fart^(TM) and as such I'm not a stranger to VT-100 escape codes. But why "markdownesque"? Why not use a markdownparser to get the complete experience, rather than rolling your own partial solution? &gt; That said, I threw it all together in about a day and I'm not satisfied with how it handles emojis. You're right that it probably should insert a \N character rather than the unicode directly. At least, that would make your unicode.json file easier to make sense of with a character set that doesn't support all of the emojis. After reading the above, I can see I might come off as a negative old fart. That's not my intention; your code looks nice, it's really just the \N escape that itches a bit. 
1. Please show us your code 2. Where are you trying to display the image? A GUI? Webpage? Terminal? Are you generating an image? Printing it?
So is there any pattern to the numbers that appear many times?
Dash was basically built for this 
A long time ago, dropbox used to ship some kind of pyinstaller thing, because dropbox was made in python. But they modified the original python sources to change the OPCODE numbers. Thus, a decompiler would just output garbage stuff. Check this : https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14997414/obfuscating-python-bytecode-through-interpreter-mutation 
&gt; https://altair-viz.github.io Thanks, this is really helpful as viz without a server component is helpful to me for portability across hosting environments. Is it possible to use bokeh similarly without the server calls? I checks the documentation and didn't see this. Which makes me guess that the server is required.
Try Pydroid
Chances are we won't help you with that. Sorry.
You can use glade + gtk for this stuff. I didn't use qt, but I but it's as powerful. 
Generate a really really large random base and loop it. You could BSOD if his hardware is shitty enough. Either way if you generate 2.6Billion numbers and he has less that 16 GB Ram it will end up taking like 20Gb of memory until crashing. 
You can install python inside termux, maybe that would work
Could you post this solution there? I don't want to register there. Obviously you can change it however you like. It's a mix of translations of the functional one and the one in Kotlin. from operator import itemgetter def unique(items, key): ''' Returns a set of items, where all entries with non-unique keys are removed. &gt;&gt;&gt; items = {'a0', 'a1', 'b1', 'c2'} &gt;&gt;&gt; assert unique(items, itemgetter(0)) == {'b1', 'c2'} &gt;&gt;&gt; assert unique(items, itemgetter(1)) == {'a0', 'c2'} ''' results = {} for item in items: k = key(item) results[k] = None if k in results else item return {v for v in results.values() if v is not None} def main(): month = itemgetter(0) day = itemgetter(1) dates = ( 'May 15, May 16, May 19, June 17, June 18, ' 'July 14, July 16, Aug 14, Aug 15, Aug 17' ) dates = {tuple(x.split()) for x in dates.split(', ')} # Albert knows the month but doesn't know the day. # So the month can't be unique within the choices. dates -= unique(dates, key=month) # Albert also knows that Bernard doesn't know the answer. # So the month can't have a unique day. months_with_unique_day = {m for m, _ in unique(dates, key=day)} dates = {(m, d) for m, d in dates if m not in months_with_unique_day} # Bernard now knows the answer. # So the day must be unique within the remaining choices. dates = unique(dates, key=day) # Albert now knows the answer too. # So the month must be unique within the remaining choices. dates = unique(dates, key=month) assert len(dates) == 1, 'Something went wrong!' print(' '.join(dates.pop())) if __name__ == '__main__': main()
thx i will try it
How would the people feel about registering packages with similar names proactively by the original developer, much like Google owns googl.com and so on?
You can spawn a thread connected to NATS and communicate with it from handlers. 
Flask-rq looks pretty cool. Anyone recommend using this over celery and rmq? 
Totally reasonable. The thing with pypi names and package names in general is that they are negotiable anyway. If someone were dumb enough to name his project djago and could give good reasons why the name should go to him, there is no problem with doing that, really. At worst it would produce errors that would be very to track down and very easy to fix.

&gt; efficiently in parallel You need a different language. There isn't a library in Python that can do that. Here's an anecdote of me trying to write a stress test for an HTTP server in Python. I used `tornado` with its asynchronous HTTP client to create multiple workloads for the server and to launch them all at once (or so I thought). I also had Apache's `ab` to check simpler workloads. After my code ran (i.e. was able to execute workloads correctly), at first, I've got an impression that I must have done something wrong, and that no parallel execution was actually happening. I asked on SO and wrote to `tornado` mailing list to make sure that my code did what I intended for it to do, and both times I've gotten an affirmative answer. The difference between `ab` performance and my code that was running an equivalent workload was several orders of magnitude, and the more simultaneous jobs (up to several thousands, depending on the system running the test code) there were, the relatively worse Python's performance was. To be clear, when I talk about orders of magnitude, I mean that at the time `ab` was able to execute 1000 requests in parallel, Python would do something like 10. Later, I also tried `aiohttp` - it's a laughing stock. It cannot even handle this many requests, so no performance really. Tried modified `requests` with `gevent` or similar combos. It's all toys, not the real stuff.
I believe this is the best solution!:)
&gt; I'm using Windows7 That is a major problem. Building LAPCK libraries on Windows is an involved process, and so much so for someone who'd never done anything like that. I'd suggest switching to Anaconda distribution of Python, they have their own ways to get you the libraries / install their toolchain to build the necessary glue code etc. With Python from python.org you are setting yourself up for a long and painful adventure.
I made a really simple text editor with pyqt in like an hour or less, for what it's worth. PyQt/PySide2 may seem harder, but IMHO if you learn basically how to use QtDesigner and study the examples, it's actually easier to make even moderately complex apps than with tkinter.
I used Qpython which works well
Pytoexe
That means when they " import djanga" in their code they'd have to misspell it exactly the same? 
The real question is, why did pypi accept those packages in the first place? A secure policy must begin with a "deny all" rule and from there, figure out how to write a balance between security and practicality. 
pip install pyinstaller pyinstaller --onefile my_script.py
Nope, the setup.py can install anywhere including packages with the right name.
Why you need `push_stack` at all? It makes your code broken in some cases of multithreaded app. Also, my opinion is that in production code no one will use `print` as output and empty string as message, so it is better to remove defaults and use it in form `with timethis(logger.debug, "processing task %r", task_id):` and the output will be `processing task 12345 took 1.234`, of course, with customizable with key-word argument suffix `took` by default.
Kind of like Don Quixote memoirs, about how he fought the windmills... You used `typing` which is a patently bad idea, and discovered something paradoxical about using it... and then you fought to understand the nature of the paradox. Well, good for you, but you stopped short of actually getting to conclusion... In real life dogs eat meat. And, if you want to model this aspect of real life, you have to have method `eat` which specializes on `dog` to accept `meat` only. Your intuition was right the first time, but the stupid type-system was wrong, but you made the same mistake lots and lots of programmers do: they trust the computer to be right about things it knows nothing about, but has an opinion for some bureaucratic reasons.
Vote up, we use exiftool as subprocess from python (exiftool support some nice json response and ready to be used from other code as subprocess), since it is most powerful exif lib we have found.
Good points. I'm using a stack to get more readable output when `with timethis()` statements are nested: &gt;&gt;&gt; with timethis('doing everything'): ... with timethis('task A'): ... time.sleep(1) ... with timethis('task B'): ... with timethis('task B1'): ... time.sleep(0.5) ... with timethis('task B2'): ... time.sleep(1) ... │ task A: 1.001 seconds │ │ task B1: 0.501 seconds │ │ task B2: 1.001 seconds │ task B: 1.502 seconds doing everything: 2.504 seconds This does indeed break when multiple threads are used. I'll either start using thread-local stacks or give up on that idea. I also agree that using an empty message by default doesn't make sense, but I still think that defaulting to `print` is reasonable.
While I agree with you, couldn't you also write a tool to check for similar package names? So you upload your package and it would check the name using the Levenshtein algorithm or something to the top 2500 packages? If something is very similar then it raise a flag.
That would help a bit. But it still requires someone to review the flagged packages reasonably fast. It's pretty easy to come up with a plausible¹ name that have a very low distance to e.g. django. 1. Both dingo and quango have a distance of 2, which is comparable to the typosquatted names.
Do you intend to use his computer system unauthorized, or not in accordance with his acceptable use policy? I'm calling the police.
&gt;adding a local Mqtt broker you need a mqtt broker on a e.g. raspberry pi/pc etc. and a subscriber that sends the data to GCP using e.g the Google python libs. MicroPython doesn't support JWT and/or Elliptic Curve Cryptography yet and that's the big problem :( .
I’ve thought about this, but since I’m already using asyncio, surely there’s got to be a way to just use concurrency rather than having to resort to multi threading?
I know this is the python sub, but I would look into Go. Syntax is easy to pick up if you're coming from python, and the language has tons of built in features for doing parallelism and concurrency. 
It's not about concurrency, but preserving state for short lived threads. Your NATS client has to live somewhere.
I used to toy with the idea of registering a package called "requirements.txt", hoping to catch folks who do `pip install requirements.txt` without the -r flag Pretty sure it wouldn't work, but still
Anyone can register and upload any package they want - I definitely did. Is this good or bad? Well, if you believe Python's strength lies in its vibrant ecosystem, then throwing up hindrances to uploading packages will be counterproductive.
Download a virtual machine, put windows iso image on there so you have windows, then download py2exe and do as stated above, then put exe onto SanDisk/usb/cloud/external storage, and you should be sorted.
There are so many soundalike packages that might be difficult. Heck there are event plenty of duplicate library names from different developers that are not malicious in intent.
 You deserve it! Atleast you took a personal stab at it. Feel great of the accomplishments. 
Nah, I feel only shame. As a classmate told me earlier in the week "never before have I worked so hard to achieve so little". I must admit, being thrown in the deep end made me actually investigate what was going on. I didn't make much headway but what I did learn I think I'll remember for a very long time. Where as when you're spoonfed you do well in the test then remember nothing. FYI, I've tagged you on Reddit as "Coding Legend" ... it's only ever been awarded once in my lifetime. You deserve it! 
&gt; you have to have method eat which specializes on dog to accepts meat only. But this is something I thought was going on in the first place. The type checker revealed a gap in my reasoning. Also, how do you suggest this method should look like? Should it have `isinstance(food, Meat)` check inside? I will kind of include this option in my second blog post. Thanks for your comment :)
I take it! Thanks!
For me, the decision about whether to swallow tag misspellings would go the other way if you were guaranteed to find any errors before users got hold of your code. As it is, things could break for them unnecessarily. I think second-best is just to treat a missing emoji in a status message like any other misspelling: if you don't notice, it probably isn't that important to you. &amp;#x200B; The library was largely written as a programming exercise and for my own use, rather than after careful consideration of its practicality, so I don't resent the grumpiness! I'll use it when I want to make some text purple and bold, and don't expect anyone else to. &amp;#x200B; Thanks for saying my code looks nice. :-) &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
Remove the conditions to your else statement. It should just be: Else: Execute code here
 if option == 1: print... elif option == 2: print... elif option == 3: print... else: print....
Something like this would have helped: https://github.com/mattsb42/pypi-parker
I guarantee that they could if they thought YouTube-dl was hurting them to much. It is just not worth it right now.
Is the source code for these still available to look at somewhere? I’d be interested in seeing how the exploits were implemented. 
haha well thanks! And actually a friend of mine will be moving there in the near future, so maybe I will climb that mountain of beer! I've had my fair share of impossible assignments that I wished somebody would save me from. It does teach you to consider anything possible but in the moment it's awful. 
Made in Processing.py
Thanks!
This seems more like a question for r/legaladvice than python. Depending on what you are doing, also remember that the contents of their site are likely covered by copyright as well as any other agreements.
I think I'd do this, (I've not used NATS before though), ``` from quart import Quart from nats.aio.client import Client app = Quart(__name__) @app.before_serving async def startup(): app.nats_client = await nc.connect("demo.nats.io:4222") @app.after_serving async def shutdown(): await app.nats_client.close() @app.route('/') async def index(): response = await app.nats_client.request("help", b'help me', 0.2) ... return something ```
People created packages with similar names to existing popular projects. Anyone can upload a new package as long as you get the name first. For examine one of the malicious packages was called colourama with the real one called colorama 
Is this for learning deep learning Keras? You recommend the docs etc is a good place to start yes? &amp;#x200B; thanks.
As commented above you could try outsourcing this work to the package maintainers. Alternatively, on pip pull you could check for similar names yourself and correlated this with download number. 
Hmm depressingly the same thing happened precisely a year ago: https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ten-malicious-libraries-found-on-pypi-python-package-index/ 
In case people are interested, this actually detected by [looking for malicious code using static analysis](https://medium.com/@bertusk/detecting-cyber-attacks-in-the-python-package-index-pypi-61ab2b585c67) This strikes me as hard. 
&gt; A while back some library in npm had to give up it's name and as vendetta the author removed it from npm. Meh. Seems entirely reasonable to me. 
Sorry this is my first time posting in this subredit, i will post again with images
Huh. It's almost as if companies around the world collectively pull in many billions of dollars in profit using Python, Pip, and the PyPA. Maybe they could, I don't know, help a bit?
You can't copyright ideas. So if a competitor reads your code and learns your secret sauce, they can do a clean-room implementation of the algorithm and you couldn't do a thing. Even if your license agreement explicitly prohibits looking at the source, how are you gonna prove they violated it? You'd have to patent your algorithm for protection.
Please don’t post images of your code.. Just copy paste it and make sure to format it correctly (indent everything with +4 spaces).
u/VoidCap i simply used the inline code button :)
There aren't that many devs who work on python packaging 
&gt; You can write code that handles 1000s of simultaneous Not in Python, sure, but in Python, at least as implemented in CPython today, that's a fairy-tale. The best you can do in CPython is to call to some code written in another language, but then you cannot execute any Python code in parallel anyways. I think that the rationalization once used to be that the speed of I/O will be so low that it will dominate everything in your data-path, and you can be reckless and sloppy because the other thing won't let you get any speed anyways. But, speeds of hardware and the OS had improved, and the userland programs, especially written in Python and similar languages only gotten slower. &gt; Take this from someone who has written commercial services in Tornado and aiohttp for many years. As someone who was testing this stuff, I know that this is an empty statement. Commercial services may differ in many orders of magnitude when it comes to performance. There's no guarantee that comes with the "commercial" tag. There are also a lot of tasks for which performance is not important, so that even things like Tornado or aiohttp would work well. But any non-trivial workload that will require parallel code execution will blow them out of the water.
Does this just bundle Python and all the package deps?
Thanks u/_theFaust \- tried this and built on this (and another solution by u/techcontraversy to acheive my result)
What about the pkgutil and timeit packages? Since those are included in the standard library.
Security is not a hindrance, it's a necessity. An ecosystem that ends up distributing malware to its consumers is not "vibrant", it's having serious trouble. In my eyes, the counterproductive thing is to make it easy to inject malware into the ecosystem.
Ok 
Thanks u/techcontroversy \- your solution along with others helped me figure out how to achieve this. I did have to amend it a bit because it was looping through 500000 records and the script was grinding to a halt (for want of a better expression). I do not know if you can chuck arrays in Py (maybe something to learn for me!! ) so what I did was run two for loops to extract the ids and then use your logic to loop through them. This seemed to have done the trick. &amp;#x200B; On a separate note I have no idea if there is a max execution time for a Py script or if it supports multithreading to help me reduce the time taken for the script to execute. At the moment it is taking about 1 minute to draw down the 500K records, extract the ids and compare them! More learning to be done my end... &amp;#x200B; Thanks once again for all your help (everybody) - all of you are amazing :)
Thanks u/CaptainLethargic 
I'm just trying to point out that there is a problem when a famous package repository accepts malware and cannot be proactive enough to prevent it. Having few devs working on packaging only compounds the problem, of course. It's a hard problem, and there are probably several ways to tackle it. I can think of a couple, but I'm sure the people more familiar with PyPI can think of other ways to tackle it. I would suggest having contributors who already own and maintain packages go on a pool of reviewers that should check proposed packages. A proposed package would only enter the official repository if it got enough upvotes from these reviewers. And also, enforce a big-enough manhattan distance between the names of packages to prevent typo squatting.
that's a very gray area, in any case I highly doubt that Walmart would persue legal action against a John Doe just for scraping their website using a script... wouldn't advise to anyway :p
No. Your reasoning was OK. Typechecker is dumb. &gt; Should it have `isinstance(food, Meat)` Well, this is asking for a lengthier answer than what I can currently write, but I'll try. Essentially, Python has three different poorly coordinated type systems. # The real type-system The one that actually matters and defines how your code behaves is the one that is coded into interpreter, it is based on the interaction between structs of type `PyObject*` and `PyTypeObject*`. The idea here is that `PyTypeObject*` structs have a fixed number of slots, whether these have values or NULL-pointer in them is what defines whether the object lives up to the expectations of the function operating on it, or whether your code will raise an error. For people who are not familiar with CPython's interpreter this would be related to what in proper Python is called "protocols". # The make-believe OO type-system This is based on `isinstance` and friends. This was patched on top of the actual type-system when for some reason Guido decided that there have to be objects and inheritance and other bells and whistles. At different stages of Python's history it produced different results, was harder or easier to fool or to manipulate into believing all sorts of wrong things. As it stands today, it is, basically, trying to copy from Java all the bad things that Java ran into in the course of its development. Your particular struggle was the reflection of the struggle between this type-system and the Hindley-Milner type-system, that was patched on top of the other two. # The Hindley-Milner wannabe type-system This entered Python due to the latest fashion and revival of "functional" approach. This type-system has very little insight and relevance to how Python actually works, so it imposes bizarre restrictions on the language only to appear more fashionable. It's where it is bordering with absurdity: instead of understanding how the language works (perhaps, not in the best way possible, but, hey, it already does something in the way some of us like!) it imposes a completely foreign rules on it, that don't make any sense. So, to sum it up: no, don't use `isinstance`. It is a useful tool for doing operations on your program's code, to maybe manipulate it, alter it, debug it, but it is not a good tool fro writing web servers or scrappers or data-mining and other practical tasks. Neither should anyone use `typing` package. That's a failed experiment, just a pointless fad.
I've seen it in practice. I've written such code. So I know you're mistaken. Python code can certainly run in parallel. Even with the GIL. Suggest looking up David Beazley's talks on the subject.
No. Why?
The application lives on Google Kubernetes engine, and reports logs to Stackdriver via standard output. GKE runs an OOTB version of fluentd that does not support timestamping with more than second level accuracy. I’ve opened a ticket with Google about this. We have a requirement to log at the millisecond level for obvious sys-admin related reasons. To get timestamping in Stackdriver to milli or nano seconds, you have to enable a JSON payload, which requires Logs to be formatted as such. If we were to move to a custom logging agent, we would lose the google administered support and updates that come with the OOTB config of fluentd. So yea, it’s a requirement but totally valid question. 
So this is actually similar to what I ended up doing, but it’s annoying because it’s a bit of a hack and does not get applied globally. I need to add a handler to the root logger but haven’t figured out how to do it in Airflow yet. Every time I pass a handler object with a formatter into the logging config it breaks logging.
Maybe not deny, but at least fire off an email to the similarly named package and have a process to delay the registration.
 🖨 = print 🖨("✋🌍")
He actually removed all of his packages (over 250 of them) from npm because of being forced to rename one of them (due to a trademark complaint). 
Not legal even in Python 3. The first character in an identifier (such as a variable name) is restricted to the underscore, characters with a Unicode General category of Lu, Ll, Lt, Lm, Lo, or Nl, or with the Other_ID_Start derived property. 🖨 has General category So, and does not have the Other_ID_Start derived property, so it's not legal as the start of an identifier. (it's also not legal in the rest of an identifier, since the added categories/properties allowed still don't include it)
&gt; Python code can certainly run in parallel. Even with the GIL. At a laughable speed, as in multiprocessing, yes. Or you wouldn't be able to allocate any memory at all, and you cannot write even arithmetic in Python without allocating memory. Anyways, show me a Python program that approaches the speed of `ab`, it has to be at least 10 times slower (but faster is, of course, better), that does the same thing as `ab` can do. Until then all your chest-beating is meaningless.
Yeah, you're right. It could've had some funny looking core if it was legal.
I don't understand why so many associate Pandas with ETL. Does it have APIs like petl's fromsomethin(), tosomething() ? 
if it is much easier to scrape using the given data, could you please give me an example of how to extract something? I just need a little bit of a reference to where I can understand and get started 
Yeah I had a similar issue with something in boto3 or requests for a flask app handler thing I wrote. Since the logs weren’t super important for what I was doing I ended up setting the module log level to exception or something. Basically I had a very similar and logging would randomly shit itself when I tried to futz with the formatter or anything outside of level. I’m guessing that we both are missing something with the logging module design =\
Use a dict! switch_dict = { '1': 'you picked 1', '2': 'you picked 2' } print(switch_dict[input]) 
As in, `djanga` could install something in `requests` that monitors all my traffic?
&gt; PyPI (fortunately) does not allow requirements.txt as a package name, so that case is handled already. All forbidden package names that are hardcoded in PyPI source code are: ... https://pypi.org/project/requirements-dev.txt/ So it wouldn't work, and some good guys are doing the work we all need. We just need a little expansion of the list.
I think what they're trying to say is you could install `djanga` and that package will still be imported as `django` but with malicious code
Thanks for your suggestions. I've at least dabbled Bokeh/holoview, and now (after reading this thread last night) I tried Altair. I like the Holoviews and Altair APIs and interactive user interfaces equally well. I've tried packaging up a HV file rendered via bokeh, but I have not been able to get the links between charts and drop downs to work. I don't know enough about altair yet to know how to do this. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
The package name is separate from module name and can be completely different. Also a one package can install multiple modules.
That's one thing another is to deprecate setup.py and just use declarative setup.cfg. Hopefully that's the plan.
Yes this is most helpful thank you. I shoved this into a widget that I made using Tkinter. Could you run me through your comprehension though? I’ve used “set” once before to make ordered lists (or something like that), but I’m having difficulty picking apart your arguments here. Could you maybe turn it into 2 for loops? Also, I get a couple of double values in the x list but with ‘/n’ besides them, what’s up with that? Not at the computer right now but I’ll paste my code soon.
This isn't even a question. You never stated what you are trying to do. More importantly, this isnt a help sub. Please check the rules before you post. 
It's just a button, with a graphic that I've included inside the source code. Take a PNG file, encode in base64 then it's possible to use with tkinter / PySimpleGUI. Seemed a lot more in line with a "desktop widget" than a traditional rectangular button. I did the same kind of thing to make a Mac-like window.

yes, I believe it's even worse than that... they may be able to install files anywhere pip has permission to do so. This is why we recommend people use venv/pip install --user so they don't need to use root to install packages.
Perhaps a little nuclear! Also kind of indiscriminate. I don't know what I think about this: * Sometimes measured retaliation is justified * Never respond and spend your life being a victim * If you aren't careful the whole world will make you responsible for their well being. Perhaps he should have reissued them with a (non-OSS compatible) license that specifically excluded this company, anyone who worked with them, and everyone who had ever worked for them....
Note if you licensed it foss you can't revoke peoples right to continue distribution so the proper thing is not to include anything people can remove in the store to avoid people breaking everyone's builds. Example clojars does not allow removal. 
Thank you for replying!
Good thing I only run my Python on my supermicro servers with Intel chips and Xorg installed.
Sounds like bottom line is Caveat emptor: Buyer beware. If you're looking for a specific python package, make damned sure you know who made it, when and double check its spelling. &amp;#x200B; Glad to see PyPI take this action.
While I'm glad these are removed, I don't like the idea of calling an impersonating package a malicious one-- usually when people think malicious package they think real packages with malicous code inside it, like what happened with the NPM webpack issue and what a guy warned about regarding micropackages.
Actually the plan is to deprecate setup.py and use pyproject.toml (see PEP 517 and 518)
Yes, I see both point, but I find it weird that standard lib have something that has 1) surprising behavior and 2) inconsistent complexity. The behavior make sens, but I believe not as a default.
It's just reading every line in from the file, then splitting each line on spaces. Then I take that list of lists and flatten it. Then do list(set(flattened_list)) to pull out all unique values. The reason there's elements with '/n' is because I didn't strip the line before splitting it, my mistake. 
Huh?

Really ?! 
The whole affair was stupid. The guy behind npm shouldn't have given away the name because of pressure by some third party, there should have been a discussion. Pulling the repos was petty and ineffective, because it was open source, lots of people had copies and all that happened was a short time of outage and confusion. And the group who claimed the name was stupid and petty for insisting they needed that package name.
Yep, [Emoji Code](https://www.emojicode.org/) 
That must be so cool ! 🏁 🍇 😃 🔤Thanks !🔤 ❗ 🍉
I continue to post `plumbum` examples in this subreddit because it's a vastly underappreciated library, and has been for a very long time. Here are the equivalents of all those `fansi` examples: #!/usr/bin/env python3 from plumbum.colors import blue, italics, bold, green, magenta, bg print("Here's a string", "formatted with Ansi characters!" | blue, "It's partly blue!") s = f"Here's a string {'formatted with Ansi characters!' | blue} It's partly blue!" print(s) print(f"This {'text will be italicised' | italics}. This text will be {'bolded' | bold}. {'This text will be both' | italics &amp; bold}.") print("This text will be normal.", "This text will be green, bold and italicised." | green &amp; bold &amp; italics, "This text will be back to normal.") print("This text will be magenta on a blue background." | magenta &amp; bg.blue) print("Here are some \N{pile of poo} emojis! \N{panda face}\N{tiger}\N{cat}") 
Thank you! I didn't know this.
If pypi started will security first it, sadly, would have not grown. Wed all be using whatever prioritised convienence. But now that is market dominate they can ease the slider from convienence towards security.
I don't know Pandas as well as many of the users on here, but I'd be happy to help if you have any specific questions
A familiar library for some of you that does this almost annoyingly is beautifulsoup4
Thanks ... basically the problem I'm having is that I'm trying to filter down a column to those that include the string "Canned" in them and then unique on the column directly to the right of it. This is as far as I've gotten but it errs out: ```sodas = ['Canned Soda', 'Canned Soft Drink'] unique_sodas = chipotle.loc[chipotle.item_name].isin(sodas).loc[:, ‘choice_description’].unique()```
Yes, the .exe should run on any windows machine. So the target machine does not need to have python.

Hello. I'm interested in developing artificial intelligence apps for daily use . I have recently learned how to code in python and I'm ready for any challenge that occurs. What are the best tools for making an AI based app? 
It's like everything would be possible, had the Pypa access to a modest funding for one or two full-time employees. However it more or less run on a shoestring, so all of the shouldve-couldve-wouldves are really just a pipe dream with no-one to actually execute them :(

What a wicked thing to make 😈
IANAL but I believe that the verdict of a 2017 lawsuit says that its OK. &gt;A judge has ruled that Microsoft’s LinkedIn network must allow a third-party company to scrape data publicly posted by LinkedIn users. The Wall Street Journal reports that the ruling is part of a lawsuit brought by hiQ Labs, a startup that analyzes LinkedIn data to estimate whether workers are likely to leave their jobs. LinkedIn previously ordered hiQ Labs to stop scraping its data, and the startup fired back with a lawsuit. [source](https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/15/16148250/microsoft-linkedin-third-party-data-access-judge-ruling) Basically LinkedIn wanted to stop people from scraping *public* data the courts said that they cant. The verdict is being [appealed by LinkedIn](https://www.courthousenews.com/linkedin-takes-data-scraping-fight-to-ninth-circuit/). So it may change. But for now I think that as long as your scraping *public* data, you should be fine. After all, thats exactly what Google does.

I mentioned two. The head first series was designed specifically as “visual learning” books, so.. in that respect those books are “visual” The Jeff Knupp book is not explicitly “visual” but it’s well organized and presented in bite-sized chunks, so I think it follows some of the same tenets of the HF series. More importantly, the OP’s request specifically mentioned being interested in learning about working on complex projects — in my opinion that translates largely into learning “pythonic” practices — I’m not clear that the HF series covers that, so I recommended the Knupp book because I found it to be an excellent guide to what “pythonic” practices are (and explaining the reasons for them).
Could parse through the table, look for a td with Cash and cash equivalents in its text, and grab the next td with a number in the same row. Similar approach could identify the row you need. 
Which job? I talked about two. I assume you mean the first. The first wasn't a particularly complicated code and what we were after was whether the output data was in 32 bit or 64 bit. The tech support's claim was that his code read the data using 64 bit and therefore the output was 64 bit. He was probably just not knowledgeable about their software vs. lying. I work for a 3rd company, but I'm aware of the internal workings of the file format, so I got asked. Once I realized the file format I had parsed without seeing the tech's code got the same answer as what the compiled code did, but I used 4 bit floats, which are 32-bit, it was pretty obvious he just told us what we wanted to hear. The guy I was working with then went and decompiled the source and looked at it and yep, 32-bit. He just told me the result of it, which we already knew.
I'm too old for this shit
Could you possibly give me an example of how to do that? I am new at this. So I didn't really understand what you said. 
This is very useful information, thanks!
As it became common for celebrities/politicians to edit or remove embarrassing twists and posts, you can save them that way...
Thank you for the details. I had the same idea, but recently noticed that Walmart has a terms and conditions page even for their public website so was concerned about it. Im fine with playing cat and mouse with their developers, but wary of playing with their legal team. 
1. r/learnpython 2. Is the `d` in the fourth function parse*d* is intent? 2. Use debugger to check it. (I once had a generator by mistake, and didn't understand why function hadn't called)
Cool I should check that out sometime
Hmm, maybe i could make a reverse gif bot and attach this functionality so people can call my bot to screenshot any website they'd like.. Would be interesting to see if it catches on. What other image uploading functionality could i attach to it? Could make my reddit bot basically be a jack of all trades bot for this kind of stuff
It was a thing until somewhat recently. It was a greyhat package that would publish your IP and username to a website. The description was very clear about what it would do, though.
TL;DR: If you typecheck an abstract Python object, you bring nothing to the table except for additional bureaucracy that already has a solution (it's called docstrings), which is anti-pythonic, so why promote it? The only benefit to introducing static typing today is that possibly in the future it allows for a runtime to skip runtime checking and the only tangible benefit of that is speed. I started writing code in 1988, in Fortran, C and C++, with a smattering of Pascal. Back when you had to worry about Real vs. Protected Mode addressing. So for how's that for anonymous epeen. Nobody used Python 1.x for enterprise, Python was a toy language back in 1992 just like Basic was and what many people consider Haskell to be today. I don't know what or who you code for today, but I can assure you, every data science person gives zero shit about GIL because that's not what affects them (since if you're going to do concurrency, do it right and use multiprocessing, but that's another argument for another time). The fact that a GIL-less runtime also happens to almost always be statically typed is pure coincidence. Almost nobody "important" uses GIL-less implementations for the reason being even more that it limits the language to the point that you might as well just do it all in native JVM or .NET CLR if you really need GIL-less (just look at the current state of all the alternative runtimes). However, the machine learning people _do_ care that run-time type checking of bound numerical and collection objects makes loops involved in functions like QR decomposition orders of magnitudes slower than without typechecking. That's why they use NumPy, precisely so they can use static types that are never checked. 
I'm helping training a bunch of beginning programmers at work and they keep asking me why pip won't install this or that standard library package. 
I suppose the problem with this is that a screenshot of a website doesn't really prove anything because you could trivially forge it.
But doesn’t that close / reopen a new connection on every request? Wouldn’t that slow things down due to the overhead?
!!!! Thanks for this.
Something weird is probably happening in the parse part of the function. I would guess you have an infinite loop that is getting started somewhere due to a global variable or something. Otherwise you should be getting an error or a result but python doesn't just give up on execution... Does the entire program finish? or do you have to quit the script when you run it? Is there a os._exit() hiding somewhere? Another idea would be memory issues, maybe. How big are the files you are opening. 
Thank you for the long explanation. &gt; The Real Type-System It's hidden on C level. And, as far as I know, it's not part of language's specification. So it's kind of irrelevant from my blog post's point of view. &gt; Your particular struggle was the reflection of the struggle between this type-system and the Hindley-Milner type-system, that was patched on top of the other two. I understand that you think that typing package (based on Hindley-Milner type-system) does not fit the Python language. I get it. I'm not saying you are wrong. But I wouldn't say my struggle was not something "real" (Don Quixote reference). You've seen my examples. Do you think the state of the code making it possible to feed a dog with chocolate was imaginary? (It would obviously be possible even without using typing package and mypy checker.) I must be missing the key element of your reasoning. In your previous comment: &gt; In real life dogs eat meat. And, if you want to model this aspect of real life, you have to have method eat which specializes on dog to accepts meat only. Your intuition was right the first time, but the stupid type-system was wrong, I'm still not getting how you propose to avoid the dog-chocolate issue. &gt; Neither should anyone use typing package. That's a failed experiment, just a pointless fad. In your posts, I really did not find any direct arguments for this claim. There are some hints and I will follow them, though. In practice, Python typing package and mypy make my code more reliable, it's a proven and battle-tested fact. Even "silly" things like `Optional` type are really helpful. Thanks again for your comment. I will definitely be researching typing and type systems further.
If you already haven’t running on sublime why do you need to get it running on Atom There’s not much else I can do unless you post your code here
I used atom in school and learned to code from there, since then I haven't been able to set up atom at home. Subline works but I dont know how to make it accept inputs. I figured out how to make atom print as well, but not take inputs.
What exactly can't you figure out? There is not much to go on here..
It's very useful in web development. Idea is that you often want to see how your website gets rendered across different browsers and screen sizes. A common way to do that is to generate screenshots across a variety of settings and present them to whoever's doing QA. 
I prefer to use a terminal for inputs. I don't think atom is designed for executing scripts. Not sure if you are on Windows though but try iterm or on linux the built-in commandline. Then there is [script-runner](https://atom.io/packages/script-runner) as a plugin. 
I recall input not working in Atom for some OS (can't recall which one). When using Atom, platform-ide-terminal is a very handy alternative. It does not let you run your code using F5, but it's still very useful (and it accepts input, too \^\^)
i will ask in that subreddit thanks,
I'm on vacation this week. Hope my scripts keep everything running smoothly at work until i get back!
Typo haha
Entire program finishes and there is no os._exit() The biggest file is about 300MB
The assumption would be they may have passed the scream test. No one called screaming, it should be ok.......maybe.
I thought they had a single full time employee working on the Python infrastructure? Also the exact same thing happened a year ago. Even with a shoestring budget why would this issue not have been prioritized?
The PyPa appears to not have unified voice, to me it looks like members trying to drag packaging in different directions, but in really setuptools/pip is the current standard and ultimately those packages decide. It doesn't look like there is anything that pyproject.toml provides that couldn't couldn't be done through setuptools. The argument about not reusing setup.cfg is not convincing it sounds like author just liked toml format and wanted to use it at any cost. setup.cfg is really sufficient for distributing applications for example: [metadata] name=my-awesome-app description=blah long_description=file:README.md author=Me author_email=me@example.com [options] setup_requires= setuptools_scm install_requires= pytz typing; python_version &lt; "3.5" PyJWT[crypto] tests_require= packages=find: [options.entry_points] console_scripts= myapp=myawesomeapp.cli:main setup.py: #! /usr/bin/env python from setuptools import setup setup(use_scm_version=True) You can then generate a wheel package which will install all dependencies. And creates myapp in bin directory that starts your app. setuptools_scm generates version from git tags. This is good starting point, there are more options available: https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setuptools.html#configuring-setup-using-setup-cfg-files For deployment in production you want package pinning so for example what you deploy in production is exactly what you tested. You can do that easily with pip-tools package which integrates easily with CMS. You of course don't need it if you use docker.
Again your comments are next to useless unless you’re going to post the code
loopOn = "Yes" Win = 0 Lose = 0 while loopOn == "Yes": ask = str(input("What happen: ")) if ask == "w": Win = Win + 1 elif ask == "l": Loss = Loss + 1 print(Win/Loss) 
I wrote a bot to repeatedly ask this question on r/Python 
Should be. Luckily i have a couple people that have my back in case something catastrophic happens. Plus our monitoring system would send me an email and i havent gotten any yet so good to go i think.
Facepalm Sublime doesn’t, uggh. Dude!!! It seems like the Atom that you were using as an integrated development environment or an IDE Sublime doesn’t do this
Has this question already become a member?
In python 3, you can use // to do integer division. It gives the result without the remainder.... So 14 // 5 is 2. So you would just do (x // 14) + 1
Thank you! I'll take a closer look when I get home 
Idk then. Use a debugger and see if there is anything you are missing. A few Gigs of data loaded into python could be causing your problem depending on your computer. I would expect a memory error but it still worth investigating. 
IF you're using anaconda, you should make use of conda environments. So create a fresh environment with just geopandas (e.g. conda create -n geo python = 3.6.6 geopandas) and use it. If you then need to test out other packages, clone that environment or create a fresh one - at least you'll have an unbroken geopandas to go back to. Also, I would modify their conda commands to include the version (e.g. conda install numpy=1.13.1). They seem to want specific versions but aren't enforcing that which could lead to issues. 
You need to post the code that you're actually having trouble with if you expect help. The function definitions in your post are missing the def keyword, so you obviously didn't get this code running.
Well, I actually managed to find a workaround for this problem. I found the dll files in a libspatialindex zip file through the pandas binary library link. I copied this files into rtee site package folder, then changed the core.py file to match the name “spatialindex_c-64.dll” and it works now. 
perfect, that's exactly what I was looking for. Thanks!
It's also a lesson in watching out for transitive dependencies. When a single library can break an entire ecosystem, you're walking on thin ice. Was it left-pad or something that broke the whole js world a year or so ago?

I don't want to live on this planet anymore. 
I use the same technique to implement restricted python sandbox. The requirements were nearly the same - VMs were not going to help and we wanted to be able to execute some user-submitted code if it was sane, and to throw an exception if it was not. We use AST parsing, substitution and recompilation to wrap callables and other object classes to special versions that also do further checking/management and to prevent things like deep inspection.
it seems like entrypoints is too easily exploitable?
I know this is for like... Complete projects but I want to tell you about my stuff! So... Please forgive! I decided about a week ago that I wanted to get into programming. After some deliberation, talking to my software engineer friend, and research, I picked python to learn the foundations of coding with. It generally seems to be a super superior language. It's modern, has a ton of libraries and IDEs, is extremely commonly used so it has a huge community surrounding it, and it's apparently really simple compared to many other comparable languages. And apparently it's super powerful. Soooo... I started writing down things I wanted to make. My initial list was the following, but I actually decided to condense a lot of it into a single program which I intend to add a GUI to, and expand. This program will be called my Suite. Inside of the Suite will be the following overarching functions, or at least these are my ideas. I'm sure things will be added and subtracted. Date and time display. This is in and functioning. Displays at the beginning without any user prompt because I don't know how to do user input yet, or at least I'm actively learning it tonight. Groceries. This function will basically ask me a series of objects, and if I say yes, the object is stored as "you need to buy these:". Basically, I buy a lot of the same things for groceries every week, including things like eggs and Oatmeal. So, first, it'll ask "need eggs?" if my input is yes, it saves that. If no, that isn't added to the final shopping list. It does this for every commonly bought object of mine. At the end, ideally, I'd like to add a function that asks if I have anything I want to add to the list for this week, and it would add that to the list, then display the whole list of things I need to buy. Aka my final shopping list. Next function is budget. This simply lists all of my monthly costs and tallies them up for me. There's basically no user input on this and I could add this tonight most likely, once I figure out how to make my suite ask me which function I want to launch. A dream for this function is also to ask me if I've paid all of these things this month yet, and if I HAVE, it doesn't take that number associated with that bill and add it to the cost tally. So it would be like, "paid rent yet?" and if I returned no, then rent's number would be added to the total cost of the month. If I returned yes, that number wouldn't be added to the cost of the month. Next function is goals. Goals would function similarly to budget, except I could add and remove goals at will. So, when I input Goals into my suite, it displays a bunch of my goals in a list, and then asks me if I want to add to or remove anything to or from the list, or do nothing (which by the way would return me to the base suite input for asking what function I want to launch). I have some ideas for this but I'm waiting on them for now. There are more functions planned but I don't want to blab on for too long. I have a lot of dreams for this program, such as integration with my phone (aka the program could send me alerts when a bill is due and how much its for), a full GUI with buttons that launch the different functions, a background in the GUI of the program, and the background is pulled from the /top/daily post in /r/Pics (so basically the background of the program would be different every day), and a ton of other stuff. Is this ambitious? I think so, yes, and is it probably way too much for my first project? Probably. But I want to have a direction to move toward, and I'd be happy if I could even get half of the functions of this program up and running properly in a GUI-less console. :) I'd absolutely love to hear your thoughts, opinions, and input on everything I've said if you'd be willing to share. :) 
Argparse is one of these "reread the docs every time" or copy from a running program, due to complexity and to, usually, infrequency.
The most secure and trustworthy approach would be to follow what linux distributions do and basically audit every package before it is accepted to pypi.
Uninstall and reinstall. I prefer to use Anaconda as you can create virtual environments with different versions of python.
There's really nothing special. Remove your old Python install from Windows' "Add or Remove Programs" utility, then install a new one. Realistically, you don't have to uninstall the old one. It's normal to have multiple Python instances on the same machine. (That's what virtualenvs are, in fact - just a new copy of Python in another directory.) If you're still unfamiliar with using Python or your OS from a developer's perspective, though, having only one version might save you some short-term headaches.
This question?
The first thing I would do is think about how to make your project modular. That way you can add one functionality at a time. I would strongly consider a web UI. Web is a huge pain, but worth getting into especially early on. There is a lot to learn no matter which direction you choose. Finally, maybe it’s because I deal with databases all day, I would encourage you to choose databases to persist your data. I like SQL, some people hate it with a passion. But again, like the web stuff, it’s something you add to your resume. Hope you have fun. It sounds like you have a lot of plans and that’s great. I don’t know how many posts I’ve seen about people wondering what kind of project to work on once they’ve learned the basics of python. Sounds like you’ve got ideas to spare. 
THANK YOU! IT WORKED!
Thanks!! I think I'd like to get a bit more familiar with programming fundamentals first, before I get into Web UI and web anything, really, just because at this point, I don't know most of the basics of this whole overarching field. I will definitely check out Web UI when I am able to though. I just put it on my to-do list breakdown for programming. When you say choose databases to persist my data, what do you mean? As in, run my website off of a server which I store locally? Because it's interesting you bring this up. One of the things I want to do in the next year is create a server which I can access from all of my devices; I think these servers are called SSH but I haven't done a ton of research on the topic yet because I'm still setting up the framework for it. Like I need better internet, I need to understand the fundamentals of a few more things SUCH AS servers and databases, and I need to cobble together a working computer that can run this server, and I'm not 100% done with that yet. I also intend to run it on a Linux distro, and I'm still working on making that switch on my main machine so like I said, the road is long before I reach that point. Anyway, yes, I have a ton of ideas! I didn't even share them all. One of the other ones is basically a weather feed that pops up on the top of my Suite and also comes up on my phone in the morning, and shows me the weather for the day. I know there are endless apps for this, but I think this is a good idea because it would teach me a bit about website scraping and relaying that information at a specific time of day. There's a lot to be learned in that project, I think. Another idea was a text editor. Another was a chat client that would require a login to access. Thanks for your reply! It was nice hearing your perspective and I'm really glad to hear you think I've sort of got my shit together with my ideas. :)
In my never ending quest to automate every mundane task at work to spite my boss’ idiocy, I have further embraced selenium. I was asked to help upload 600 files manually while our systems email notification function was off (so ppl didn’t get spammed). Normally this involves going through a web system, picking recipients based on crime criteria, and writing some stupid custom email msg because the systems developers were idiots who couldn’t properly template messages. I thought this would be easy because email posting notices were off, so no need to waste time writing emails. My Manager instead INSISTED i fucking write every posting email following our templates as “practice.” A FUCKING MONKEY MIGHT NEED PRACTICE WRITING AN EMAIL NOT A FUCKING HUMAN. The stupid system was built like Jitterbug for the web. So I used my favorite method of telling my stubbornly old fashioned and spiteful boss to fuck off; secretly automate the whole thing. I used selenium, pandas, and regex to find the custom urls to reach each documents uploading page, select recipients, write the email using .format() and dictionaries (after fighting with the stupid pop up iframe xpaths), and click through all needed pop ups and next buttons. Uploaded the first doc batch. Boss now has a pile of emails to QC because the system requires it. So I saved time and stuck it to my boss. I FUCKING love python. 
Weird flex

I tend to agree and may even continue to vendorize my module in most of my own projects that use it. On the other hand I still feel that it's useful to have a sort of reference copy.
There's also [docopt](http://docopt.org/); it lets you define your arguments by just typing out the help page for your program. 
Excuse me. Are you polish? 
What about PyCharm is better than Sublime? Or rather, why should I switch to it? 
neat! this could be great for debugging and stuff.
It does a really good job with parameter help, code completion, etc. I'll admit that I'm not a sublime user, but I have heard several people that have switched (or some that switch back and forth). It's the leader in the field and so it's klinda hard to go wrong by starting with the most popular tools. Later you can branch out when you want some specific advanced features that Sublime has that PyCharm may not. I added a plugin to PyCharm called CodeGlance that adds the really cool scrollbar that shows a miniature view of your code. I'm not sure what it's called specifically in Sublime. It's just an opinion is all. Everyone has their favorites.
Bad bot
I'll check it out right now. 
Ok... I’m kind of stoned right now... but I thought this said you wrote an “asparagus” recipe book and thought this was going to be on one of my cooking subreddits and was confused when I saw which sub this was in
Currently learning Python and need some ideas for beginners projects. Already learned the basics, database connection and pdf creation. Any ideas of really interesting projects, and of course, challenging ones?
[For example](https://i.imgur.com/d1CdGrO.png).
The simple, clear way: import math math.ceil(a/b) If they're all integers, then `(a + b - 1) // b` == a/b rounded up. That double-slash is the floor division operator, which divides and then rounds down.
My boss is the same. Thanks for this idea, I'll try it! 
Just use `np.einsum`.
**Automated Response:** This question?
I wish pip search could be better as currently I am not aware of how to make search efficient. For example if you do pip search django, it comes back lots of things which could be difficult to filter. 
use anaconda!
Ansible module: `rds_option_group_facts` Tenable/Nessus scanner deployment for AWS
Thank you! This works for the case of multiplication. Is there a case where this would work in the case of addition and subtraction? Perhaps I'm not seeing it. An example being, A[i,j] is 8x8 B[k,l] is 101x101 An element in A is subtracted from each value in B to give a 4D matrix - C[7,7,100,100]? instead of, [Ax,Ay] = meshgrid(linspace(0,100,1),linspace(0,100,1)); [Bx,By] = meshgrid(linspace(0,7,1),linspace(0,7,1)); for k in range(0,8): for l in range(0,8): C(k,l,:,:) = Ax - B[k,l] 
No, but atom-ide is in the works.

this world does not deserve that kind of things
The traditional package management systems in Linux distros don't have this problem. When was the last time you heard about something like this in debian? It's just the language package managers and the new snap/flatpack/docker stuff that are stuck in the wild west.
That's true ! 
So, to take an example, I maintain [this package](https://pypi.org/project/pwned-passwords-django/). Like the name implies, it's an integration of the Pwned Passwords password-checking service, for Django. [Here's another, legit, app doing a similar thing](https://pypi.org/project/django-pwned-passwords/). [And another](https://pypi.org/project/django-pwned-validator/). [And another](https://pypi.org/project/django-pwnedpasswords-validator/). And I'm sure there are more. Which maintainer gets to "own" any package name that would obviously be a Pwned Passwords integration for Django? How would you like to decide that now, and which ones would you kick off PyPI?
I'm so sorry! I was too hasty when I replied to you. I fixed the code to run. Ax has a shape of 101,101 Bx has a shape of 8,8 C has a shape of 8,8,101,101 I will have to test newaxis to see how it works. 
That *was* the left-pad thing. The guy who pulled all his modules off npm to protest a trademark complaint was the author of left-pad.
This is why Open Source software is so important, it limits the options of nefarious coders by subjecting them to the scrutiny of others.
Oh snap, I thought it was 2 separate events. I guess the other one I am thinking of where someone got a malicious upload on a legit library and npm had a bad time dealing with that.
These are the stories that really belong here hahaha. Way to go!
Thanks. Turns out this worked. Looks like I have a thing or two to learn about the app context. 
Thank you for not making yet another bad remake of 80% of the functionality. 
I have been looking for something just like this! Can't wait to try it out. You're a hero.
Any existing packages can be grandfathered. We don't have to be dumb about this. None of the names you suggest are typo-squatting, although it's still not a desirable situation to have four package names so similar. The place to start would be edit distance anyway, since that catches typos. We want to reject nimpy, scypy and panda5. We have already have a manual process to take over defunct packages that requires PyPI maintainer intervention. Requesting a name very similar to an existing package could have a similar approval process.
So now it's a land rush. Say a new online service opens up, the rush is on to claim package names relevant to it and, if possible, do bad things in those packages. Everybody else will be auto-banned from making a real package until bureaucracy runs its course.
&gt; It's hidden on C level. You cannot be more wrong. This is how this language is written, this is how it works on a conceptual level. It is not hidden, it is the *essential* part of the language, whereas the rest is an impostor. If you decide to treat Python while neglecting how it is written or how it actually works, your treatment will be superficial at best, but, most likely will be just irrelevant. Your *struggle* was real, your *problem* was made up. &gt; I'm still not getting how you propose to avoid the dog-chocolate issue. Don't use classes to solve your problem. Classes model hierarchies, but in your problem there isn't a hierarchy. You tried to use inadequate tools to solve your problem, and, in the end, you didn't solve it... so, I thought the conclusion should have been obvious. &gt; In practice, Python typing package and mypy make my code more reliable Yeah... because you measured reliability in some way, compared it to other approaches and so on... right? No, you didn't. You just follow the fashion trends.
Definitely not sure.
Thank you.
Thanks a bunch! Didnt really know how to use an else statement but that really helped
I'm not entirely sure what you mean by "Fractal compression", though if you just mean compressing the image file as much as possible your best bet might be to search for or make an PNG writer library that uses zopfli as its compression backend.
Adding to the other comments, you should probably use r/learnpython for such questions :)
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal_compression
This example doesn't use the app context, but rather just stores things on the app. As I understand the app context it is created if required on a request and will stay until there are no longer any active requests. This means that the app context would be more efficient using connections (would be closed when unused), however it would be more costly on the requests when the app context and connections are created. This solution keeps the connections constantly open but creates them when the app starts, before any requests are handled.
PyPI is already vulnerable to land rushes. But I think you just want to argue and naysay. I'm not interested.
To recall the connection, I use current_app.nats_connection though.
\&gt; This is how this language is written, this is how it works on a conceptual level. You are mixing implementation with specification. \&gt; Don't use classes to solve your problem. Classes model hierarchies... Food -&gt; Meat, Animal -&gt; Dog, both are hierarchies. Thus, I used classes. I made a mistake by mixing the two hierarchies. I wasn't aware of the mistake before I ran mypy in my code. Mypy made me fix my mistake. \&gt; Yeah... because you measured reliability in some way, compared it to other approaches and so on... right? I measure reliability by number of bugs. Mypy is reducing bugs in my code, ceteris paribus. It's doing it even in simple cases like "I forgot a variable may be None" (Optional type). It's a fact.

I wrote a script that will read my office365 email and when receiving a specific subject from specific contact (it happens very often) requesting a report, it will connect to an Oracle DB running some code then generating xlsx output report then replaying to that email with file attached. 
This is expected behaviour. Take a look at this: [https://docs.python-guide.org/writing/gotchas/#mutable-default-arguments](https://docs.python-guide.org/writing/gotchas/#mutable-default-arguments)
This exact case is covered in Reitz's Hitchhikers guide to Python: https://docs.python-guide.org/writing/gotchas/#mutable-default-arguments
Ah beat me to it
Why not try contributing to an open-source project? You’d see higher complexity without actually having to build everything yourself.
Maybe your indentation is wrong. Or try self. _x, and use the underscore for private vars in order to differentiate them from arguments. 
Space missing between `def` and `__init__`?
thank you! this was the issue
thank you, i just noticed this aswell. much appreciated
I'm primarily a linux admin so it's either cron to run a job on a schedule or start the script at boot and have it run itself
&gt; We tried to find the answer in the documentation without success so far. I remember when people would [read the FAQs](https://docs.python.org/3/faq/programming.html#why-are-default-values-shared-between-objects) before asking questions. By the way, a bit of experimentation at the interactive interpreter should reveal what is happening: py&gt; def test(): ... print("default argument is evaluated") ... return [] ... py&gt; def spam(arg=test()): ... pass ... default argument is evaluated py&gt; spam() # Is the test function called? No. py&gt; Default arguments are evaluated *once*, when the function is defined, not each time the function is called. So if the default argument is a list, it will always be the same list.
An editor with syntax highlighting would "detect" this error early. Try it. Helps a lot with code in any language.
Data persistence, as I would define it is, the ability to store and retrieve data independent of the lifetime of any application process? Something like that. So the idea is that you are going to have to application process, like a weather app, whose job it is to deliver content and react to user inputs like mouse clicks or keyboard presses. But the process will run for a certain time and exit. Generally speaking any data like global variables are trashed when the process ends. But you may want to store the data for next time or if you have multiple clients trying to get at the same data at the same time. So you could store the data in a file, which would solve the first problem, but not the second. Managing transactions like reading or writing or updating data can be made a little (or a lot) easier with databases. I don’t find the barrier of entry that high for DBs. I use Postgres. It free easy to install and has good documentation. Sounds like you’re in the middle of a computer build, but for $35 you can get a raspberry pi that runs Raspbian and in no time at all, boom, you have a DB server. Add Apache and now it’s a web server. In terms of UI, it’s hard no matter what direction you go. Where do you want the button? How do you want it to look? That part is not that bad on the web. The nice thing about web is that it gives you an interface with no installation of software (beyond the browser). It may be easier for your phone to navigate to a site rather than trying to push something from your computer to your phone. I am leaving out all the cons, the biggest one being that it’s all a big pain. 
Obviously, with Reddit growing in general. Don't see how this is interesting.
I was excepting a tutorial. 
You're right. Math.ceil is the way to go then
I pip installed timeit in a virtualenv by accident i'm pretty sure, inside a vm which i mainly use for messing around although i did have some projects with API keys. Should i assume they're compromised?
Python has grown massively too..at a higher rate than reddit most likely.

That was the first rule of r/Python now that I look to the sidebar. My apologies

If you're going to be operating as a contractor, have a product before you start any contracts. I'm in a sticky situation where I've been thinking about software I wanted to build for a while and I got a contract to build it for a university, but now they own all the IP for that software. If I had a version before I started with them with a license I had applied, I would own all the IP, but as it is, they get to decide what license to apply. So I can't reuse that code anywhere, and if I did, their lawyers could attack me.
Also a common Python interview question 😉
 sys.exit(69) Lol
I assume it's a selfbot then? ;o
Maybe Thonny? 
Could this work with your GPU as well? 
It was first released in July of 2018 so it's a newcomer to the field. &amp;#x200B;
`psutil` doesn't support GPUs, I don't think. You would need a package that gives you GPU loading data.
`current_app` is a proxy to the app, rather than to the app context so that is fine.
This is great. Thanks!
Huh, that sounds like something I'll definitely be doing in the future then. I intend to have a lot of things accessible and cross communicating between my phone and computer (s), as well as whatever other devices I own when I set this all up. 
If you want to scrap a certain text or image from the website, inspect the website source elements and highlight what ur looking for, you should see in which container its stored... You can start from there
Yes, you should assume that. From the table in article it looks like it was sending some kind of information to them whatever that is, so that information should also be considered compromised.
It's fairly advanced for being new. 
It's come a long ways in a short period of time. A lot of time and energy has been put into it. It has been users that have greatly helped the feature expansion. As new applications are tried, missing features are found and usually quickly implemented. Every day something new is being added or improved. &amp;#x200B;
Have you ever seen the credits for a triple-A game? It takes millions of dollars, hundreds of people years to design and make a game like that.
One class/function at a time. Seriously though. 
I recently joined a team who were using argparse for some decently-sized software. They wanted to add some (I thought) quite simple extra functionality so I offered to do it. Argparse ended up being such an obfuscating mess I just wrote it all myself using sys.argv. Ever since then I've just been happily implementing my own commands with a bit of custom code. Maybe I just struggle with their documentation but I don't really see what it adds. The functionality we wanted to add was to use the same commands for different things depending on context. For example, you would write "-r log -e 123" where -r is some function you want to run and -e is a particular engine you want to run it with. Ideally we would have been able to permit different "-e" (engine) commands depending on the "-r log" or whatever came before it. So "-r log" might have possible engines "123" or "321", but "-r get" might have possible engines "456" or "654". It just seemed utterly impossible in argparse but was a breeze with sys.argv, using enumerate to keep track of which command was which.
lots and lots of engineers, and they usually all work in some kind of a framework, so things have a logical order, and there is usually an architect or Senior Engineer to decide how it all goes.
this is what I got so far: \#from here downward we will work on the file itself \#we will take for example a random 10-q form url = "[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/315293/000162828018009710/q22018aonplc.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/315293/000162828018009710/q22018aonplc.htm)" &amp;#x200B; r= requests.get(url) soup = BeautifulSoup(r.text,'html.parser') a\_string = soup.find(text='Cash and cash equivalents') \#finding the immediate parent which is a tr above it \#then finding all columns of that row \#and printing the third print(a\_string.find\_parent('tr').find\_all('td')\[3\].text) &amp;#x200B; and it gives me the wanted result, except I can't do this for each and every one of the wanted values. does anyone have a better way of doing this? &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
And all those engineers working long hours for many years (5+), building the game piece by piece Plus debugging a lot
I have had this same question before especially as a beginner programmer myself. Something like that seems so ominous. But if you think about it hundreds of people contribute to the code. Probably whole teams that work on one single aspect of the game. I.e. 10 people work on the "horse mechanics" another team works on npc's, another on environmental stuff. Ect and so on
Apologies for this question that could easily be answered by looking at the repo, but I am being lazy... What framework are you using for the UI?
This is an absolutely brilliant suggestion. 
No worries. ClassificaIO has been developed using the standard Python interface Tkinter module. Hope this helps.

I've looked at the docs a bit and I'm impressed. When I need GUI I usually just need something simple and quick. This is exactly that. I'm assuming at this point that you're the author?
