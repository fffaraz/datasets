Even if it were true it only matters at the very end and you just round to the nearest nickel at that moment.
Great question! This is because when you take an input, it is a string. You need to convert it to integers if you would like to make comparisons. Add this line above your if statement and it should work. However, it might throw an error if the input is not an error. x,y,z=int(x),int(y),int(z)

Pretty much writing the one hit wonders, but I am looking to extend it with some rhythm simulation to make proper riffs and hooks and shit. Music theory has always interested me but I have never put in the time to actually practice an instrument so this was the next best thing. Plus, I needed the practice in writing classes :)
Ah shit. Thanks.
Same.
Really good point. E.g. how do you use int to represent an international number. As those would start with + or with 00.
Sounds great! Feel free to extend the code as you see fit, I have had a lot of fun with it but I am far too busy with my studies to continue at the moment. Hope to pick it back up again towards the end of the year. Next feature I want to add is some way to specify the rhythm so that it be used to write riffs and such, rather then just give the relationship between notes.
When did you deactivate it? After creating it the virtual env will be loaded automatically until you log out or close that shell. Next time you have to activate it first before you have access to the packages installed with in the env.

It really depends on what you want to do, personally I use matplotlib, but a lot of people use seaborn which takes less effort.
That's awesome! Pretty much the same idea I had. That would be very useful because I've noticed when creating music there is clear patterns how I would create melodies and harmonies based the scale and chords. Just need to turn that into code. Would help getting even better ideas.
input() returns whatever you type as text, so if you type 2 it views it as "2" - a character not a number. You need to convert it to an integer, one common way to do it is like this: x = int(input("Enter a number: ")) y = int(input("Enter a number: ")) z = int(input("Enter a third number: ")) However, if you type something invalid (anything other than a whole number) you'll get an error.
I highly encourage you to contribute to some xls read/write libraries :-) Recently i had to edit an xlsm file in backend and none of the existing solutions could do the trick, so i had to use cpp library with some tweaking.

I have seen people doing this, but I have often found the result complex. &gt; 1. doing the pattern matching compilation which is already implemented in the repo(check pattern_matching.py). there are implementations like this https://github.com/santinic/pampy, which IMO sucks because of lambda functions limitations and eager evaluation. I like your implementation using with, I think that most of the problems solved here are workarounds around eager evaluation. What I think can work better are some string based DSLs with suport in editors via plugins. like this ```Python,tabs=4 with match(expr) as m: if m('pattern'): pass ``` the pattern would be highlighted and checked in editor via plugins, which is maybe hard to implement, I don't have an experience with it. &gt; 3.inlining some operations, like in the Pipe project, | operator costs much, you can always transform a | f(*args) into f(a, *args) This can be useful, but not for performance reasons. The problem of the pipe operator is that it does not work with every function. &gt; 4. automate some tasks without runtime costs. Like generating getters and setters, make a default constructor by its fields' definitions You don't really need AST for this. Classes are introspect-able, and can be modified. Sometime you can generate a string from template and eval it, as collection's namedtupe does.

You have to use the command “python3”. Because with macOS you have python 2.7 preinstalled and you cannot update it so homebrew will created a new command called “python3”. Same as pip will be for python==2.7 and pip3== python3.7

I'm sorry but you're being too harsh. /u/lordmauve is incorrectly being downvoted. There are different use cases in (investment) banks. For _accounting_ purposes you are totally right. Amounts should be correct to the cent and one should use ints or decimals. But for simulations, projections and forecasting one uses floating point numbers. The model errors are already in the thousands so it makes absolutely no sense to be precise to the cent. In a numerical algorithm this costa _a lot_ of performance. There is a difference between storing actual cash flows for clients and performing simulations for pricing via numerical algorithms. Every bank will do the latter with floating point arithmetic (and possibly GPGPU and SIMD).

Good work
Yes
That is an abuse of **property**, and certainly a misuse of **global**. You would need to subclass **dict** and overload `__getitem__` to handle calling and returning a callable value, that’s awkward but not especially difficult. The harder part is JSON-serialization, because passing in either a custom object_hook or encoder _is_ the mechanism by which you get **json.dumps** to serialize your objects. Maybe take a big step back and explain _why_ you think this _unusual_ approach is the right one for the task at hand?

&gt; I like your implementation using with, I think that most of the problems solved here are workarounds around eager evaluation. Thank your for your appreciation. Resolving eager evaluation issues is a good part, however I don't totally agree with "most of the problems solved here are workarounds around eager evaluation". The static code generation promises us more space to analyze and transform our codes, like avoiding the redundant runtime checking. Many previous implementations did very well in code generation at least, we should salute for the long-term researching. As for the recent one, Pampy, I don't admit it is pattern matching, instead it's more of a **dynamic contract library**. You might have checked benchmark.py of Moshmosh project, and if so you must have seen what a big gap between Moshmosh and Pampy in terms of the time efficiency. &gt; What I think can work better are some string based DSLs with suport in editors via plugins. In fact, I think it feasible to have mypy support. Guido and other core devs are committing to Mypy very frequently, and the Mypy plugin system is sufficiently awesome to allow us customize the type checking. The author of [adt](https://github.com/jspahrsummers/adt) seems to be very familiar with making Mypy plugins, [and he is exactly the one who motivated me to write Moshmosh](https://github.com/jspahrsummers/adt/issues/18). &gt; the pattern would be highlighted and checked in editor via plugins, which is maybe hard to implement, I don't have an experience with it. Supporting checking can be very hard, but highlightling is trivial. &gt; &gt; 3.inlining some operations, like in the Pipe project, | operator costs much, you can always transform a | f(*args) into f(a, *args) &gt; This can be useful, but not for performance reasons. The problem of the pipe operator is that it does not work with every function. Yep, you're absolutely right! I remembered that about one year ago I was working with PyTorch, where a large number of APIs didn't get along well with the Pipe operator. &gt; You don't really need AST for this. Classes are introspect-able, and can be modified. Sometime you can generate a string from template and eval it, as collection's namedtupe does. Of course it's not necessary to use AST, but IMO doing this with ASTs is more reliable. When you said the introspect-able classes, my immediate impression was also the namedtuple, but I think it not that elegant. In the atmostphere around me, string concating is regarded as the most evil/unbelievable way to do code generation tasks. Although Python ASTs are a bit heavy and not that elegant as well, I think at least ASTs could be more maintainable and robust when a breakage(like Python major version bumping up) occurred in syntax level.
Pattern matching.
you can subclass dict ``` class MyDict(dict): def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs): self.update(*args, **kwargs) def __getitem__(self, key): val = dict.__getitem__(self, key) if callable(val): return val() else: return val &gt;&gt;&gt; d = MyDict(a=1, b=lambda: 2) &gt;&gt;&gt; d['b'] 2 &gt;&gt;&gt; d['a'] 1 &gt;&gt;&gt; # or create from normal dict &gt;&gt;&gt; d = MyDict(**{'a': 1, 'b': lambda: 2}) ```

Spyder. That's all I will ever need in my current role ( analytics).
Which server, which client, and how are you running them? Do you have a separate python environment just for your vim plugins, in which case how does it know which version you're working in? Or do you install the server in every virtual environment you work in and use that?
I tried this, but json.dumps() apparently doesn't use __getitem__. I can't figure out what it does use though.
Will pyautogui support second monitor? also, it would be very useful if it could ignore transparent pixels. very cool project, thanks for your work on it.
There are no alternatives with the power and flexibility which matplotlib has. &amp;#x200B; Most of matplotlib's problems stem from copying MATLAB's interface rather than choosing to make a sane API. Now people are used to it, so if you tried to impose a well-thought-out, consistent API they'd be like "why is this so verbose and unintuitive!?".
A few years back matplotlib would work in conda but not virtualenvs, so I switched to conda, and then it worked in virtualenvs but not conda, so I switched back. I haven't had any problems in either recently though.

I'm using an existing library which calls json.dumps() for me. Hence the reason I can't change the call there. The explanation as to why I would want this is the same as the reason property() exists in the first place. Sometimes a piece of data is static, other times, it needs to be computed. "Property" allows for, among other things, the ability to have a class attribute still accessed like a normal attribute but computed with a method call. There are alternate implementations I can explore, but, this seemed to be the cleanest if I could get it to work. An easy alternative would be to pass the dict (potentially full of callables) to a handler method that will invoke all the callables and return a dict of the actual values and then pass that to the library using json.dumps(). And that's what I'll do if this approach doesn't work out. It just seems that all the pieces are there, I just can wire them together correctly.

1. What I do is load environment variables into settings using os.getenv() like this: `SECRET_KEY = os.getenv('SECRET_KEY')` . How you get them into your environment depends on your server setup. 2. If your js needs are light, this is fine. 3. Typically you would use a real web server like Apache or Nginx which would route requests to Django. Just put your static files somewhere that makes sense in your web root and adjust your Django settings accordingly. You can use the colllectstatic management command to push changes. 4. When you're more familiar with the framework it doesn't take that long. However, if you're doing lots of small projects, boilerplate might be helpful. I have used Two Scoops in the past but nothing recently. &amp;#x200B; I'm afraid I'm not up-to-date on tutorials.
Thanks for all your hard work. I run into a lot of beginners in help channels asking for help who don't understand why keyboard input with pyautogui doesn't work for games using DirectInput/scancodes on Windows. Documenting this somewhere in the tutorial might help? Thanks again!
I just installed [Thonny](https://thonny.org/) at work because it has Python 3 bundled with it and a nice package manager.
properties*
Yeah, I’m aware of what **property** is for... what it’s not really for is dynamically running dict keys. def two(): return 2 def four(): return 4 def six(): return two() + four() def eight(): return two() * four() class Lazy(dict): def items(self): return [(k, v() if callable(v) else v) for k, v in super(Lazy, self).items()] data = Lazy( two = two, four = four, six = six, eight = eight, who_do = "we appreciate" ) import json print(json.dumps(data, indent=4)) Not _great_, because the object returned by **Lazy.items** won’t behave like a **dict.items**, but seems to be a quick and dirty solution where you leverage the thing holding the values rather than mess with the values directly.
Thanks a lot for sharing :). Only one question. I use pipenv in my development environment, does each pipenv environment have its own variables that I can set with os? Also, if in production I want to deploy more than one app, let's say on the same Digital Ocean droplet, will I simply create more pipenv environments such as in local?
NVIM plus a couple plugins.
Dealing with the pain of matplotlib is worth it. My biggest pain point was understanding animation but if you're doing some simple plotting it's a great tool. There's some alternatives but many (like Seaborn) are just wrapped utilities around matplotlib. It would mostly depend on your implementation though.
I like [bokeh](https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/) when I want some alternative. But as other have noted, depends on what you want to do. I use matplotlib when I want to generate lots of images and save them as png for example I think no other library does that so easily.?
Hey, I'm in the same position as you, OP. Looking around, I found this boilerplate: https://github.com/pydanny/cookiecutter-django. Have you tried it?
IDEA with the Python plugin (which is basically turning it into PyCharm). Because I use the same IDE for other languages as well (Kotlin). &amp;#x200B; Recently I started hobbying on a raspberri Pi and there I just use vim ! (remotely via ssh and tmux)
you can add a method that converts it to normal dict ``` import json class MyDict(dict): def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs): self.update(*args, **kwargs) def __getitem__(self, key): val = dict.__getitem__(self, key) if callable(val): return val() else: return val def as_dict(self): return {k:self[k] for k in self.keys()} &gt;&gt;&gt; d = MyDict(a=1, b=lambda: 2) &gt;&gt;&gt; d.as_dict() {'a': 1, 'b': 2} &gt;&gt;&gt; json.dumps(d.as_dict()) '{"a": 1, "b": 2}' ``` you can't use custom serializer of MyDict, when it is a subclass of dict, but you can use custom serializer of callable ``` def serialize(obj): if callable(obj): return obj() &gt;&gt;&gt; d = MyDict(a=1, b=lambda: 2) &gt;&gt;&gt; json.dumps(d, default=serialize) '{"a": 1, "b": 2}' ```
Sounds interesting. How come you're using both Django and DRF?
It doesn't make any sense because the API is not consistent and you'll see some method calls or objects that are seemingly contradictory. The way I use matplotlib nowadays goes like this : import matplotlib.pyplot as plt update_dict = {"some_param" : new_value} plt.rcParams.update(update_dict) Which I use to prettify matplotlib, adjust fonts, dpi, parameters, etc Next, I use subplot**s** : fig, axes = plt.subplots() # plot something plt.show() Maybe others here will have a take on it but I get most of what I want from this. I'll agree that digging into some parameters is particulary tedious and if you want prettier looking plots or an easier interface you'll want to look at [Bokeh](https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/) or [plotly](https://plot.ly/python/) which are designed to be more interactive from the get go. Of course, seaborn is a good wrapper around matplotlib but you'll need to deal with the same syntax to organize your plots anyway. In conclusion, matplotlib isn't bad but if you're starting out then you'll want to take notes of some StackOverflow issues and some guides in order to get back to something you know and debug the plots.

I haven't actually used pipenv but with old-school virtualenv there's an activate shell file that sets up the environment and you can append env variables to the end of it. If pipenv has something similar, that would work but I would do a little Googling to try to find the canonical way of doing it. &amp;#x200B; Again, I don't pipenv, but I'm sure you can use multiple environments to run different apps on the same server as that's more or less the whole point.
Well, u/aptwebapps gave a very complete answer. About #2, python in general is quite slow, so, for higher loads you would want to use some things for async taskin, like celery, and some faster languages, cpp for example, to generate those pdfs.

I did used your library + PIL and others for other purpose. It was actually for the design of distant asynchrone monitoring.(which I used to solve a short term personal/professional problem). And I didn't got into problems with mouse position back then (I think because mostly I used locate image then click directly ). Thank you for the efforts and in any case I use again your library and find some bug or anything I will report.
No problem. Re: Question #3: At my work, I use Pyramid framework, not Django. Not sure if this applies, but we basically just handle file uploads using custom logic. We have endpoints which accept multipart form data and handle the files as blobs. We store file locations in an Upload table. We also return the files via another endpoint. The pythonic way here may just be 'custom logic'.

I just started using that after using PyCharm. I was tired of the bloat and constant updating with a whole new download. So far I'm pleased with VSCode, but need to get more into the settings and plugins to fully flesh it out.

Hi DesertFish, thanks for your help. I'm going to delete my post, and repost in learnPython, phrased differently.
I have been so pleased with VS Code!
PyCharm CE

Altair is what we use at work, but we fallback to matplotlib when we need graphs it can't do, takes more time to develop but is more flexible. Seaborn was really promising but the lack of stacked bars was a big problem for us. Altair has let us down when generating multiple charts at once as it starts a new selenium instance each time, although a fix is in the works. They all have their unique obstacles..
How do you compile C++? Makefiles, CMake? Just curious.
You're not returning anything from getN() or fact() so main().
Haven't test it yet. Just an upvote for visibility and as a future remainder.
Do you work on larger projects or more one off things? I've tried switching over to VS Code a few times because I think that PyCharm just feels too heavy and I just like the look and feel of VS Code more... mostly. But on my larger Flask projects sometimes it feels a little disjointed, like I'm editing a bunch of different single files rather than working on a project as a whole. I'm not sure how else to describe it really. This is especially true when it comes to virtual environments.

This is SOO close. It fits my requirements exactly. Unfortunately, I didn't know ALL of my requirements until I was able to get this step out of the way: "items" being the method I needed to declare. The library I'm using is not using "json" directly, but, instead is using python's "request" package, which uses "json". Apparently, "request" uses a custom decoder that doesn't work with this solution. If I use json.dumps(), I get exactly what you suggested. However, the request package is actually calling "body = complexjson.dumps(json)", which must access the dict in another way, because I get: "TypeError: Object of type 'function' is not JSON serializable". So, now, to dig into "request" a bit and see what it might need to make this work. Thank you for your help.
Context?
Ah... so... From requests: ``` from .compat import json as complexjson ``` And from requests/compat ``` try: import simplejson as json except ImportError: import json ``` But, I tested and I don't have "simplejson" installed ("import simplejson #ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'simplejson'"). So, I should still be getting "json" through all of that, right? And requests doesn't seem to touch the json before it's used, so this should still work. More digging is needed.
IDLE 😅 I've configured it with cool colors and fonts... and I got used to it... It doesn't have the sidebar to jump to classes or defs but ctrl+f works for me. and it also has helpers for methods you write the dot and it pops up the vailable attributes/methods and It is really cool IMO... basides the color schemes I selected make it look so cyberbunk... I love it
I love VS Code. I’ve recently switched and installed plugins for Django and Pylint. It still has a few hiccups here and there but I’ve been continuing to fine tune the settings.
Let’s take this back a step, because you still haven’t established that what you want to do is a good idea, much less a sensible one. What precisely does our code look like at the moment you issue the request that serializes your data? Could you simply “concretize” your data before that request is sent? Like at the moment you do **request.get** or whatever?
There's a meme about people storming area 51 on September 20th. Under the idea "they can't shoot all of us." I found it funny, a little to funny, and got carried away by alcohol into making this uhhhhhh, thing.
It's cool, but personally (and i don't think, i'm the inly one) i hate microsoft ides for their insane keyboard shortcuts since visual studio (i know that they are remappable, but anyway)
Community is alright, if you go to school, chances are you get the pro version for free! Database GUI is built in and supports html/javascript editing which is a pain in community.
The simplejson module was the name of the json module before it became part of the standard lib. You’ll virtually always have json these days.
What call are you making with requests? Can't you make a simple GET request and dumps() the json yourself?
Especially these days
So I've modified your example to the following, but it's quite flickery. import math import tkinter class Gui(tkinter.Tk): def __init__(self): super().__init__() self.t = 0 self.canvas = tkinter.Canvas(self, width=1024, height=768) self.canvas.pack() self.oval = self.canvas.create_oval(0, 400, 30, 430) def step(self): x = 400 + 130 * math.sin(self.t) self.canvas.coords(self.oval, (x, 300,x+30, 300+30)) self.t += 0.01 def main(): gui = Gui() while True: gui.step() gui.update_idletasks() gui.update() if __name__ == "__main__": main() main()
Presumably they want this for cases where v() will give different results at access time than at storage time.
NeoVim (+dwm)
&gt; lsp What's that? I used to do the tmux/(n)vim setup a lot. I've mostly switched to VS code for the past two years, but some things are starting to wear on me a tad bit.
Repl.it
Emacs, for all of my text editing and organizational needs. [Elpy](https://github.com/jorgenschaefer/elpy) and a couple other packages include everything Python specific that I need, macros and other neat tools like [multiple cursors](https://github.com/magnars/multiple-cursors.el) helps me edit text efficiently and with great satisfaction. And I use [org-mode](https://orgmode.org/) to keep track of TODOs, code snippets, and various notes / ideas. [Emacs rocks](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkRmQ_G_NbdbCQMpALg6UPg)

vs code is good enough for me so i don't really need an IDE (i can make vs code an IDE with a few add-ons)
MacroPy works with AST transformations, and has pattern matching: https://macropy3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pattern.html birdseye (written by me) also provides a decorator which modifies the AST, compiles it, and returns a new function. The implementation is bit different, see https://github.com/alexmojaki/birdseye/blob/master/birdseye/tracer.py#L220 and https://birdseye.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing.html#when-a-function-is-decorated-birdseye-trace-function One thing I can see which needs to be fixed is that you don't account for the user's `__future__` flags, and you implicitly inject your own. Use `compile(..., flags=flags, dont_inherit=True)`.
VIM.
That's an editor, not an IDE.
I got the Pro for free, yet I still use community. It has too many features and I am under the impression that it hogs it down. It isn't a problem on my desktop, but it tends to burn my laptop batterybpretty fast (and I don't use Battery Saver because it turns off auto-completion and syntax correction).
Oh really? I guess I’m used to it. I code on a gaming laptop and it at least lasts me for all of 2 classes
~~Notepad.~~ I've heard great things about Atom and Sublime.
yeah, i don't get why people praise atom so much because it has the same functionality as vs code
[Wing Pro](https://www.wingware.com), but the free version is all most anybody needs. In the latest version there's an API and you can customize it by writing Python scripts!

I love Python; it’s my main programming language. But I wouldn’t recommend using it for Godot unless you have a specific reason for doing so. Instead, GDScript is similar in nature to Python and should be pretty easy for you to pick up, and has the advantage of having full support for Godot.

Does windows look for files in PATH? If so you could add C:\python\scripts to your PATH variable and then you could simply use the command `facebookAdmin.py`. Or you can make a small .bat file and put it in a folder already in your PATH.
I'm under the impression that Sublime is a light kind of editor. Is that true?
The issue appears to be recursion... I have: ``` a = CallableDict() a['level'] = CallableDict() a['level']['one'] = lambda: return "value" ``` json.dumps(a) works as expected (because I imagine it calls "items" for every "dict"-like object it sees?). However, json.dumps(a.get('level')) doesn't work. I implemented __getitem__ in CallableDict, but, I'm missing something there: ``` def __getitem__(self, key): val = super(CallableDict, self).__getitem__(key) if callable(val): return val() return val ``` I think, perhaps, because it's using "dict"'s "__getitem__" it's returning that dict directly? More digging into dict is needed.
yes i remember setting up something to do with windows path variable i will look into that now thanks
VS Code. I'm very pleased with it.
Cool, I was wondering if that was just an output preview. SocketIO looks interesting. I have used the google libraries for my local projects to create or upload files to my drive account. But my flask project is published on Google App Engine (and public), so I ended up using flask-oauth just for authentication to company Google accounts. Actually getting flask-oauth (which is no longer maintained) to work on GAE was an ordeal. I need to revamp the process while adding some integration to each user's Drive account. Sticking with requests may be the way to go.
Now I need to create my own language called Khan

While Django and Vue js can be directly used, i don't like the idea of front-end and back-end code mixed together, so i am using Django +DRF to serve api only. And use vue.js in front-end to consume that api.

Pycharm ultimate
Sublime Text + Anaconda Plugin
I think this is probably the solution I'll end up going with. I can "concretize" the data before I call "request". The issue is that I've got requests in several places that all use a similar data structure so I'll have to add concreting statements to all of them, and when I use this again in the future, I'll also have to make those concrete before sending them on. For the broader picture, I have a configuration that basically says, when this set of things happens, then do this set of things (which includes a call to request). So, the configuration of things to do might look like this: ``` thingstodo = { "post": { "url": "http://something.com", "data": { "name": "me", "time": getcurrenttimestamp } } } ``` If getcurrenttimestamp is invoked when the configuration is loaded (i.e. if I used "time": getcurrenttimestamp()) then the time will be set to the time the configuration is loaded. But I want it to be the time that thingstodo['post']['data']['time'] was requested from the "dict". Making it "concrete" right before I send it would certainly do the job; recurse through the dict (in this case "data"), call all the callables, and send that to request. The trouble is that I have multiple "post" type things. And, I'm now realizing the usefulness of being able to generate data at the time of the call, as opposed to something static in the configuration (like "name": "me"), and how many of these "post" type things could benefit from this functionality. I can make a code change in all of the "post" type things to make it "concrete" before doing whatever it does with it. And with the amount of time I've spent trying to do it this OTHER way, that would certainly be the more pragmatic approach. But I like digging deep into "how things work", and, as I said, all of the pieces seem to be there, so it feels like it *should* be possible. I'm just not quite there.

Pycharm pro.... Never looked back. Couple that with Datagrip and I've never needed anything else.
Hi guys, I need ideas to suffice python project requirements that is simple but yet interesting to the Professor. I'm not very creative but I thought about a hash cracker which shouldn't be difficult. Anything that can use 10 functions that I can import from a module would be helpful thanks!
emacs &gt; vim
Do you want to start a war!!?!? COME ON MAN
I don't actually need to dumps() the json. Request does it as part of its handling of a request (when you make a application/json POST to an endpoint with data, it JSON serializes the data for you before sending it). I can repackage the data ("concretize" it, as discussed in other comments on this thread) before sending, but would like to avoid that if I can for simplicity's sake and as a learning exercise.
Same. Switched to it because PyCharm was hella heavy on my potato PC

It's a super fast code editor. It works out of the box but you can install some useful plugins for your convenience. For example, SublimeREPL lets you run your (Python) code inside Sublime Text.
You know what? I don't think this is gonna work.

Great. I'll check it out.
There are a couple things here. You’re specifying an input for getN, yet creating the input from within the function. You’re specifying an input for the fact function, but later on you’re not calling it as a function but perhaps a variable name. The function itself is also constructed incorrectly in that it is built based on expecting an argument, but no arguments are referenced in the function definition. Also, you’re calling the getN function two times - once in the print statement and once in the fact function. That would cause the user to be promoted for an input twice, and would also be generally inefficient. Take a look at the differences in my pass at it below. I’m no expert, so there may be opportunities to improve on my own recommendation. def main(): def getN(): n = int(input("Enter a positive integer: ")) while n &lt;= 0: n = int(input("Enter a positive integer: ")) return n def fact(): f1 = f = getN() for x in range(1, f): f*=x return str(f1), str(f) print("The factorial of {0} is {1}".format(*fact())) main()
I suggest you to use the API from your favourite website/social network, in order to grab data, and « kind of » analyse it (sort, draw, whatever...). For example: try to connect to the Twitter (or Reddit) API, then download data (pictures? hashtags? groups?) and try to display or analyse them.
Depend on where you draw the line for yourself. I don't think there's a hard rule. For me personally the diff is and idea has builtin tooling for debugging and intellisense.
I use PyCharm pro to do all production work. I use PyCharm community edition to work on fun open source projects. I also use an editor I've build myself called expressPython to smaller tasks (It loads very fast even in a GPD Win 1) and coding challenges. For quick edits I use vim too. I also use PyDroid if I'm too lazy to get the laptop out.
Your post is so profoundly low effort you’ll probably drop out no matter what you do.
been also wondering how do you make c++ work with vs code?
So here's what I found upon searching google... &amp;#x200B; from stackoverflow answer &amp;#x200B; Create a file named open\_dos\_here.cmd with the following lines: %~d1 cd "%~p1" call cmd Put this file at any folder. Then, go to your Send To folder (Win+E; Alt+D;shell:sendto ;Enter). Create a shortcut to point to this open\_dos\_here.cmd Then, in any folder, select any file or sub-folder. Right-click and select "Send To" and then select open\_dos\_here.cmd to open the DOS in that folder.
&gt; vim This. Fast, lightweight, does the job, ctags is great. [Long live vim](https://realpython.com/vim-and-python-a-match-made-in-heaven/).
Well, I have a non-Apple Desktop, but my laptop is a MacBook Pro 2015, and while it is pretty good, it just can't handle Pycharm for some reason. It also lags on Visual Studio and I _think_ it is because macOS is throttling them to preserve battery life. VS Code is fine, but I don't like it. That is why I switched to VIM on my Mac when I am on the go. PyCharm is fine on my desktop though and I really like it, but please give us options to remove integration like source control and other features. I can use the terminal for git, it is much easier. Maybe it's because of its simplicity that VS Code runs better on my Mac.
+1 for SublimeText. -1 for needing Cmder
What does the boy help you accomplish in a game?
Yes! As soon as I figure that out. :P Generally, I try not to add features until I have them working for Windows, macOS, and Linux.
Here is a project that my school is having me do. I've created it to where the admin can add, edit and remove users. The zookeepers have a calendar with task that are to be done that day with a way to mark them as completed. Same with the vet. Authentication System For security-minded professionals, it is important that only the appropriate people gain access to data in a computer system. This is called authentication. Once users gain entry, it is also important that they only see data related to their role in a computer system. This is called authorization. For the zoo, you will develop an authentication system that manages both authentication and authorization. You have been given a credentials file that contains credential information for authorized users. You have also been given three files, one for each role: zookeeper, veterinarian, and admin. Each role file describes the data the particular role should be authorized to access. Create an authentication system that does all of the following:  Asks the user for a username  Asks the user for a password  Converts the password using a message digest five (MD5) hash o It is not required that you write the MD5 from scratch. Use the code located in this document and follow the comments in it to perform this operation.  Checks the credentials against the valid credentials provided in the credentialsfile o Use the hashed passwordsin the second column; the third column contains the actual passwords for testing and the fourth row contains the role of each user.  Limits failed attempts to three before notifying the user and exiting theprogram  Gives authenticated users access to the correct role file after successfulauthentication o The system information stored in the role file should be displayed. For example, if a zookeeper’s credentials is successfully authenticated, then the contents from the zookeeper file will be displayed. If an admin’s credentials is successfully authenticated, then the contents from the admin file will be displayed.  Allows a user to log out  Stays on the credential screen until either a successful attempt has been made, three unsuccessful attempts have been made, or a user chooses to exit You are allowed to add extra roles if you would like to see another type of user added to the system, but you may not remove any of the existing roles.
Could probably do this up properly with something like Gurps Mass Combat rules and a bunch of effort, but this is pretty solid for something thrown together in a hurry!
How are you able to read process memory without the OS shutting me down worse than my tinder matches?
It runs around a map and kills certain monsters that it encounters to farm some loot
Relax I was just asking for suggestions since this is a beginners python course lol
By having root privileges and going through the os apis :)
I might look into that. This was a hack job as I was bored and just really into the meme. Thank you though. I know is not a great program but knowing people enjoy the concept makes me happy.
Hmm now I know why there are few games with Linux support! Devs don't want cheaters 🥴

Cmder is certainly not a requirement. It's just for the looks. I can directly use the command prompt or power shell but I don't like their looks and I don't bother to customise them.
Yup I use Sublime too. Works great.
He can just reuse that one-liner at each access
Can you use something like pastebin or dpaste or github to post the code?
I just use a text editor.
You’re on Windows?
I like the thought of using this problem as an excuse to learn more about how Python works, but in end the implementing a simple solution. To avoid adding concretizing statements everywhere, I would wrap the library request function in a function that also concretizes the data.
I remember when I first started programming those stupid student/employee/car examples further confused me because I was like how in the hell could this ever be useful? I love these examples, concise and clearly shows how OOP can be useful
It _is_ possible... you’re just going about it a little off. It appears you want a Post class that has a few methods / properties that give you back lazily evaluated datapoints, and then the whole thing has a Post.payload or some other method that returns a standard dict with the hardened data. If you’re able to use 3.7+ this could fairly cleanly be done with a **dataclass.dataclass**.

You could have done the same thing (over 10 years ago) in windows with AutoIT and nomadmemory... So it's not a linux issue
CMake (I was using that before in any case) - and the CMake Tools extension for VS Code is quite helpful with a number of things - https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-cmake-tools.
Interesting. It seems my cyber security proff doesn't know shit
By default regex works line by line. To work on a multiline input you need to add the `M` flag: pattern = re.findall(r'^-\s.*\[\s\](.*?)$', readed, flags=re.M) Note the "gm" on the end of the regex101 input. Use /r/learnpython for any other questions.
How does one go about using this? Do I need to be on a computer or could I use it on mobile.
Put your scripts in your home folder?
I suggest you build your factorial function first, then test it, and lastly make the other methods
thanks for the reply I see that flags but I try to use them like `pattern = re.findall(r'^-\s.*\[\s\](.*?)$'flags, readed)` thank you for fast reply and sorry for not using r/learnpython

Honestly, at first sight, I thought this WOULD be the simple solution. It seems so easy. If "dict" had keys as attributes (instead of in an iterator or whatever that's called in Python) it'd be done already. I even tried to implement the iterator part of it, but also failed at that. Haha. Every new language is this way. The easy stuff is easy. It's when you dig deep that the true nature of a language rears its head. I'm loving Python, though. My last "deep dive" had me learning all about how "import" actually works and it was a great experience once I dug it all out and put it back together again. "Dicts" are extra "weird" because they are native. Even a dict object has (or at least appears to have) dicts inside it. So extending it gets interesting. Before this I wrote a proxy class the overloads tons of internals that probably shouldn't be overloaded so that the class appears to look like the object it holds. It was a fun exercise. My stance come from the idea that "everything is a first class object". With that, if there's some way that a class instance attribute can be made into a property() (with a getter and a setter that still looks like an attribute), then whatever magic is happening there can be used in other places. But, it seems a "dict" doesn't work the way I think it does internally. I'll get there.
Same. I use IDLE bc I like its better integration with Python. I also made a dark theme if anyone is interested: https://github.com/Randomness74/Dark-IDLE-Theme.
I am using 3.7 so, I will look into that, thank you!
Yes, for now. And I am not a professional programmer. I might become one in the future if my mind starts to work properly. It's a fifty-fifty chance, unfortunately. I lost it to depression in case you wanted to know.
Why the hell did i get 5 nazi related stuff in a row
There's a reason they're called six-shooters.
I have been using CMake for a while so as long the editor allows me to quickly open a console, all is fine! The CMake Tools extension helps with some things as well!
All you have to do if you want to use plain ol' `json.dumps()` is `r = requests.post(url, data=json.dumps(payload))` Not sure what the problem is with that.
Seems a bit inefficient, even for Python, to call every callable in the dict each time you might want to call one of them.
&gt;Ps: Only glaring hole that remains and I gave up on is a section about asyncio module. Maybe it will be added in the future. That about sums up my experience with asyncio too. I can do multithreading, multiprocessing, coordinate worker processes across multiple containers. However, I cannot internalize the ideas behind how to use websockets properly/intelligently.

There is one from [Microsoft](https://github.com/microsoft/python-language-server). The [coc.nvim python extension] (https://github.com/neoclide/coc-python/blob/master/Readme.md) can use both and I think the Microsoft one is recommended because the author had long-standing problems with pyls before.

Ooh, that's actually pretty cool. Though, one minor point: you can use ♯pragma once for your include guards instead of the old ♯ifdef style. (Obviously using the pound sign and not the sharp symbol; had to use it to get around Reddit's weird usage of that particular symbol.) It also reminds me that I need to get around to finishing my somewhat similar thing involving a spiking net, a car, and some reinforcement learning.

Then let’s correct your comment to reflect that. I respectfully prefer emacs over vim, but I also respect your right to disagree. There we go, war averted.
IDE's existed before intellisense. 'Member Turbo C++ and Turbo Pascal? 'Member Borland?
this is a python script. You would need to have python3 installed on whatever device you wanted to run it on. It's not an app or website.
Language server protocol. VS code is using this and vim and other editors can as well. This basically let's a background server application do code completion, linting and refactoring task independently of the editor in use. It's kinda cool because you can get top notch IDE features in vim but it makes the setup somewhat bloaty.
Next step, have a CNN classify the image and take the most likely and least likely classifications it gives, then post it to r/FiftyFifty
shit... that was the one I was talking about 😅 IdleX I will remember the X next time.
You probably got some threads from /pol/ lol.
Why. I use CMDer. I love it. It’s configured to work how I’m used to. It has better support for navigating between terminals, splitting terminals and managing processes then any imbedded plugin I’ve encountered in any IDE. The fact it lives outside of your IDE doesn’t make too much of a difference and frankly I prefer it does that so I don’t have to clutter my view of the source code with process outputs or what not.
I have a lot of python teaching experience. I highly recommend you get a few face to face real live person sessions in before you rely solely on internet help. It's very hard to help someone over the internet before they know the proper terms for things. Python is one of the most popular programming languages in the world, I am sure there is someone close to you that can show you the initial steps. After that, pick a personal project and ask us on /r/learnpython if you get stuck.
Yeah, I'm JetBrains everything these days.
Especially these days
Off-topic but I've been teaching basic python to kids afterschool for a non-profit recently. I've mostly developed my own material but it's definitely getting revised as I go. Do you know of any good ready-to-go resources for that?
Both hold data and are somewhat interchangeable, but there is a conceptual difference between the key value pairs of mappings (like `dict`) and the attributes of objects in general. A mapping's keys can be arbitrary, but an object's attributes should be well defined by its type. If you need a custom mapping, look at `collections.UserDict`, `collections.abc.Mapping`, and `collections.abc.MutableMapping` rather than subclassing `dict`. If you need a class, look at `dataclass`.
Honestly you probably got one of the better images from the site.
I have been using Pydev with Liclipse for a long time. Was happy with it, and use that together with Atom now. Also use Jupyter for some things. I guess these are not popular options? What's the problem with Eclipse baed platform for Python? I have had no problems with these. Could someone tell me what i am missing out on?

Nope. Only been coding since 2014 so that was before my time.

While the first guy is kinda being an ass, he does have a point. The purpose of this assignment isn’t only the coding. It’s about the planning and effort you’re going to put into figuring out what a reasonable program actually is. This is your course and your assignment. Own it. Figure out something that you want to do and go after it. Coding can be a fun activity, especially when you’re doing it for the right reasons. Make an easy game. Make a script that does your math homework for you for the entire semester. Own it. This is your project.

I guess technically it's marketed as an editor, but with extensions, you can have most of the features of a full blown IDE. There are some pretty amazing extensions too that allow for great language specific functionality.

Yeah I agree, vscode has a great look and feel. Plus it loads up much faster. I'll usually use vscode for single file edits and pycharm to work on an entire project, which it definitely has a bit more fluidity between the project. That's not to say vscode doesn't have any, especially with the right extensions. I generally use both daily.
Exactly, one shoot for each of the 5 bullets, and a final "oh shoot!" when you realize your magazine is empty.
Ever since I started using editors and ides that use ctrl + / shortcut for comment and uncomment, I've gotten real upset with Microsoft's standard multi key, separate comment and uncomment shortcuts. However, vscode uses the ctrl + / method I was referring to. I'm sure they've adopted several of the other newer style keybindings as well. Plus, as you mentioned, they are remappable and heavily customizable. Vs code isn't typical of Microsoft software habbits, so I would check it out if you haven't already.
There's nothing wrong with coding on windows, you do your thing. I'd recommend getting into docker one day tho...helps avoid a lot of environment issues.
For 1. You could use the same .env file and use python-decouple package that reads directly from the .enc file. Typically you would not commit the actual production env file but am example file that has same keys but dummy values.
In the upper left corner is a visual representation of the bots data. The green line is the path it is following. Red circles are enemies and the green circle is the bot. There are also circles for npcs and other players. The bot randomly picks two points in different zones on the map and calculates a route to walk from point to point using an A* algorithm that I had to implement in c++ for performance reasons (my initial implementation was in python but even after optimization it took way too long to find a path). It kills certain monsters that it encounters on its path. Upon reaching the endpoint a new path is calculated.

The pip project [pyls](https://pypi.org/project/pyls/) is not a python language server. The pip package [python-language-server](https://github.com/palantir/python-language-server), from Palantir (who are basically a company contracted by the NSA and GCHQ to help spy on vast numbers of people) has a package called pyls in it; this implementation is in python and relies on a bunch of other python libraries (like jedi and rope) for its features, and so is pretty slow. Microsoft has an implementation called python-language-server which is primarily written in C\#: that's what's used in VScode, I think. Sourcegraph also wrote [an implementation](https://github.com/sourcegraph/python-langserver), but have since archived it, but now have [their own fork](https://github.com/sourcegraph/python-language-server) of the Microsoft python-language-server.
Ok, well, here's a link to a video where someone uses [Turbo C](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVdi1fa3LRs). I used this back in the early 1990's, before the Y2K hype. As an IDE, that was about as good as it got. Given that vim can bind just about anything to keystrokes, I don't see much difference, in some ways vim is more extensible than software that claims to be an IDE, but doesn't allow you to execute an external program. Another nice thing about vim is that since everything is executed outside of vim's process space, there isn't much to clog its memory up.
What makes atom better for copying?

Not in the same way though. I just prefer atom for that kind of text manipulation.

I don’t really know what you mean by “Python commands.” Python is a programming language. There are plenty of utilities for computational linguistics, but they will require some knowledge of Python to use. NLTK, the natural language toolkit, is a good place to start. But again, I would recommend you gain some basic familiarity with Python before attempting to do anything.
I see. Thanks for the input.

Well, the source is 4chan, so... statistical likelihood.
the executable name is pyls
No worries! In Python 3 (the current major version--Python 2 is still supported, but it will not be supported starting in 2020), `print` is a function. There are no Python functions that will do what you want with that level of simplicity (as far as I'm aware). If you want something which is that simple to use, you would want to use software that someone else has developed. But if you need to do your own natural language processing using Python, then it will take more work, but it will allow you to create software that is specific to your needs. I personally like the [official Python tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html). However, given the language's popularity, there are many tutorials out there. A simple Google search for "python tutorial" should get you started. Or, googling "python for computational linguistics" might get you more specific results for your situation.
hmm
Then, once you have a basic familiarity with the language (or whatever level of proficiency you wanted to gain), then you should take a look at [the NLTK Book](https://www.nltk.org/book/). It has a lot of utilities for processing text corpora and building useful solutions.
spaCy is better than NLTK. Check it out here: [https://spacy.io/](https://spacy.io/)

I used VSCode for a while and then jumped to spacemacs because I wanted a VIM like IDE that didn’t make me have to learn vimscript ~~it was also a good chance to learn lisp, which my professor can’t stop praising~~. I have to say, I quite like it, I’d describe emacs as VSCode on steroids. It was the first truly main stream macro editor, and it shows. The best thing about VSCode is that it’s ~~relatively~~ easy to write plugins and extensions which can improve your editing experience. VSCode is a JavaScript sandbox used as an editor. Emacs is a lisp sandbox used as an editor. The difference is that in emacs, u can create functions and run them immeadiately, bind them to whatever keybindings u want, and use them to manipulate the text of what your editing effortlessly. Take for example, the other day I wanted to insert a certain number of spaces after my current cursor position so that the current line is at least a certain width. I wrote a single function, added it to my setup script and set a binding for it. For illustrative purposes I’ll show all u need to get this working: ```elisp (defun pad-line-with-char-to-length (desired-length char) "appends char as many times as required from cursor position" (interactive "Nline length: \nccharacter: \n") (barf-if-buffer-read-only) ; can't pad read only buffer (save-excursion (let ((line-char-count (- (line-end-position) (line-beginning-position) 1))) (if (&gt;= line-char-count desired-length) (error (format "line of length %03d is already larger than desired: %03d" line-char-count desired-length)) (insert (make-string (- desired-length line-char-count) char)))))) (defun pad-line-with-space-to-length (desired-length) "invokes pad-line-with-char-to-length with char as space" (interactive "Nline length: \n") (pad-line-with-char-to-length desired-length ?\s)) (spacemacs/set-leader-keys “ofp” ‘pad-line-with-space-to-length) ``` Now, whenever I want that functionality to run I’ve got a few ways to do it. I can hit SPC ofp (my leader bindings) and emacs will prompt me for the desired length and run the function. I can press a number, like 120 and then SPC ofp and emacs will use that number instead of prompting me. I can hit ALT-x (M-x for emacs pros) and from there I can run any valid elisp code, so I can write (pad-line-with-space-to-length 120). I can hit SPC SPC and a list of all the functions I can use appear and I can fuzzy search to what I want to run. You can use a shorter binding if u want, like Ctrl-p if u really wanted to, but the point is u can create methods and bind keys to them effortlessly. I’ve never looked into developing VSCode extensions but they always seemed to require a certain degree of dedication to accomplish even simple things. In emacs when you’re bothered by something or continually have a need for something. U can just write a function, in 5-10 mins and then u can use it forever... that’s amazing to me. You program how to manipulate text... isn’t that the most programmer-esque way to program imaginable. There’s also a few other things I really like about emacs, but I’ll mention just ① of them because I doubt anybodies still reading at this point. **It’s designed so u can do everything from the keyboard**. Vim is as well. And once u get used to editors like that, u’ll be amazed at the performance boost you’ll reach. For example, in emacs u can have a bookmarks file (managed complete within emacs mind u, u don’t even need to see it). When I open emacs, if I want to navigate to my projects directory I can type SPC fb and all my bookmarks show up for fuzzy searching. If I want to go to the file I was editing last time (before closing emacs) I can type SPC fr. If I want to see all the projects I’ve been working on, SPC pP. if I want to quickly jump to another buffer (basically a file I’ve been working on) SPC jb is bound to frog-jump-buffer which shows u a little menu containing your recent buffers and lets u use the keys on your home row to choose ①. If u want to quickly jump to a file and then jump back, SPC tab (in my case also C-TAB) will take u right back. If you have a bunch of windows split up (like 3 different horizontal ones) and u want to focus on the ① your in, SPC wm maximises your current buffer (basically hiding the other ② windows). You can do whatever u want in the current window, jump to another buffer even. But if u run SPC wm again you’ll return to the exact same state u we’re in including the same buffer.

No one seems to be using Liclipse which I always seek to go back to. Never really liked PyCharm and VS Code can be quite slow.
thank you
You're welcome! If you can dive right into NLTK without learning much Python, more power to you. It all depends on what you need to do.
(As the person who recommended NLTK above) I've heard of that, but haven't had time to mess around with it. Looks useful, though!
THIS IS AMAZING!
Yea it basically works the same as the JSON module

Alright, you sold it. I'm in.
Is 55% good in stock prediction? As you have only two possible labels, this looks rather random...
I have tried NLTK but I prefer spaCy because it is faster and more robust and modern. NLTK is older and more popular, though.

/r/learnpython &gt; the error keeps rejecting strings for integers. Of course, why would you post the actual error, which is all of one sentence. Much better to make some meaningless ambiguous statement. It's not like error messages and logs are *literally designed to help people debug code*. One possible issue is that the default value of the dict is a dict, *not* a defaultdict. So you can only use the default behaviour one layer deep. If you want someone to `input` a number, you need to tell python to turn whatever they entered into a number. Like `float(input("your number here: "))`. The logical OR operator in python is `or`, not `|`. The pipe is for bitwise OR. Don't use bitwise operators unless you know you need them. They work in some simple cases but there's just no need to add the complexity most of the time. `x == y or z` evaluates to `(x == y) or (z)`. If `z` is truthy, that statement will always evaluate to `True`. You want `x == y or x == z`, or `x in (y, z)`. Or if you're checking a string in a case-insensitive way: `my_string.lower() == "expected string"`.
I'd think so. The stock market is meant to be considered close to completely unpredictable for technical analysis from what I understand. So anything better than 50% is an advantage. I'm not an expert though so don't quote me lol.
Awesome! I'm was actually looking for up to date resources. It's sometimes confusing with C++ if you look up stuff online. A lot of the information seems to be outdated. Thanks again
That's pretty cool! Nothing more satisfying than creating a project of real value to you.
Most of my streaming is on Youtube. Twitch, as a general rule, isn't the most accessible way of doing it, and Youtube works just fine. Any way to do it from Youtube? Thank you are very much for your suggestions.

This worked thanks! Follow up question, now that I have 10 surveys/ answers, is there a way to put the answers into lists?
There will be one in the next month
It definitely works like a charm if you use it correctly, but it's just a bit odd I think with `ConfigParser`, `RawConfigParser`, `SafeConfigParser`, which to use and why. It definitely works, just I think it could be a lot more obvious how to use for a pretty simple problem. &gt;class configparser.SafeConfigParser(defaults=None, dict_type=collections.OrderedDict) &gt;Derived class of ConfigParser that implements a more-sane variant of the magical interpolation feature. This implementation is more predictable as well. New applications should prefer this version if they don’t need to be compatible with older versions of Python. It's not obvious what the difference in behavior is and which to use for what reason. In the wording of that, it's saying this one is "more sane" and "more predictable", and it suggests using this over other ones that provide pretty much the same functionality. You have three classes to solve the same problem. I've used configparser a ton of times and honestly, I couldn't say from memory what the exact differences are. I just think configobj is a lot more straight-forward. That said, in general I prefer yaml as a config format to brick configs. It's extremely human readable and writeable, and about as easy to read and write programmatically as json. And if it came to reviewing a coworker's code and they used configparser, I certainly wouldn't complain or suggest otherwise. It works fine and it's standard library and I'm happy to keep to standard library functions. I just think it could've been a bit easier to use. If it was the best brick config parser, I don't think other people would be releasing third party libraries that solve the same problem. There wouldn't be a point.
Yeah, initialize your list before the `for` loop, then after you finish the survey add the result to your list with `append`. output=[] for survey_counter range(10): Your code output.append(survey)
There's no way I'm clicking that with a ten-foot mouse.

&gt;Majority of them are shit or edge posting Then you probably haven't talked to any. Where do you think the rejects of society go to talk about their messed up beliefs? The answer is forums with anonymity and no strict rules.
(note: I don't know a lot about python or programming in general, I might be making some mistakes here). I use pyautogui to locate particular buttons on screen. I found out (I think?) that if I have openCV installed, the logic behind locating images changes which should make the whole deal a bit faster ("faster but more memory-intensive than pure python"). However, it looks like I don't get any significant decrease in the time it takes to locate an image. Is it because the openCV implementation returns the results in a generator? Locating the image seems to be taking place quite fast but getting all the relevant information of the match from the generator slows everything down. In my use case, locating the image takes less than 40ms but retrieving the data from the generator takes a bit more than 100ms (I understand these numbers don't mean much in the grand scheme of thing). I don't know if I am wrong here but from my understanding, the generator puts the openCV implementation on par with the python implementation time-wise. Is this a "problem" that can be fixed or is the use of the generator more important for something else I am missing? If the latter is true, do you have any suggestions on how I could move on from here if decreasing the time needed is what I seek? (I know about `region`, which helps significantly, but it's not something I can use 100% of the time) Thanks for reading and sorry if I made any mistakes, please feel free to correct me.

Yeah, I didn't think they'd overcomplicate the task. I just didn't realize how "little" PRAW actually does to communicate with reddit. Or, rather, how trivial it was.
Thanks! It felt great to finally have it in a usable, useful state.
Not a problem, homes. I'm quite fond of C++, myself, but I know there's a pretty noticeable barrier to entry for a lot of people when it comes to the various iterations of the STL. Another good resource is [cppreference.com](https://en.cppreference.com/w/); prolly one of the best online quick references I've found in any language.
If you want to run it in the terminal with an argument to choose how many images you want you can add `import sys` and change the main function call to `main(int(sys.argv[1]))`
Oh, possibly NSFW btw.
Been on there for over a decade. Grow a spine
You could try using assert for positive and integer and then use return on your functions so they have an output.
Seriously, most of 4chan are surprisingly normal. At least on blue boards anyway. I frequent /g/ and /a/ so most of the content can be pretty lighthearted. There aren't many full on Nazis that you can't find anywhere else on the internet that's for sure.
it suck that i cannot copy on clipboard on my redit mobile app and past it in QPython, i will try on my pc
Not my library. its [\u\AlSweigart](https://www.reddit.com/user/AlSweigart)
Second this. Haven't had any issues with VS Code and the plethora of extensions allows you to customize it any way you'd like.
I know you're trying to conform to the "no more than 1 request per second" rule, but your calls to \`time.sleep\` are .5 seconds too long. You already have to deal with the time it takes for the code to actually run, sleeping exactly 1 second will make things slightly faster and still obey the API's limits.
If you model the success probability as a binomial distribution with n=250 (trading days approx) and p=0.5, then you have something like a 7% chance of getting 55% or better due to random chance. So who knows! However, I could easily imagine some simple bias in the training vs. test data to cause the model to look predictive when it actually isn't. For example, if the stock is more likely to go up than down during the training period and this is also true during the test period, then the model could just learn to select 'up' a little more than 'down' and it would do well. This doesn't mean it would be predictive going forward, though. Also, there's the difference between selecting up vs. down days and ROI. If the true positives (when the model predicts 'up' and it goes 'up') involve larger increases than the false positives (model predicts 'up' and it goes down) then you would expect the ROI to possibly be negative even with a model that predicts up vs. down better than chance. Anyways, I'd always be wary of anything that claims to predict the stock market, but I think this is a good tutorial none-the-less on how to use the tools and approach the problem for beginners.
Why am I not surprised that the person downplaying the 4chan nazi users is throwing insults and also into GamerGate ? It's been 5 years. Stop harassing people over video games.
Because 4chan.
Ooo right I didn't know that!
4chan is a cesspool, sorry.
Topkek Mainstream media propagandist bullshit.
But at the same time it is a beautiful and freeing place to talk to people. Better than Reddit, for sure.
Thanks, this is some interesting insight!
Did you do the work on reverse engineering the game yourself or did you follow someone else’s work?

The phase response curve (PRC) measures the change in oscillator spike-timing as a function of perturbations applied at different phase angles of the oscillation. Panels A and C show the change in timing when perturbations are applied to the 1st and 2nd variables in the neuron model (voltage and spike-frequency adaptation, respectively). Panel B is a precursor to generating panel D, which shows the right-hand side of how weakly-coupled phase oscillators will synchronize based on initial conditions.
Nah. Just people like to call anyone a Nazi and have no spine for confrontation. PC culture is cancer
Pure cognitive dissonance. I will admit that I was part of GamerGate and was on 8chan at the time. /pol/ actively tried injecting themselves into it and feeding alt-right ideas before it was called alt-right, many members of the GG boards ate that shit right up, including myself (because I was already watching IA before he started the whole 5 Guys thing). I remember the memes people made where they would say that GG should've listened to "papa /pol/" and that this was actually a war against (((cultural Marxism))), and the (((big nosed fellows))) were involved. I pulled myself out of it. You should, too. They're fucking video games.
Same, though I abandoned Elpy after a few weeks in favor of vanilla python-mode. I just didn't need the opinionated "help" and I'm so used to the plain jane. That said Elpy has some great features and I recommend it. And yes, Emacs does indeed rock. I love it for Python dev.
Lol what are you even on about. Probably a good thing you pulled yourself out if that is what you were roped into. It's just a computer, turn off the screen lmao
It's like you turned blind the moment I showed that there were actual Nazis on chan boards.
Host it on pythonanywhere and you have a party drinking game!
I did it myself. Was tougher than i originally thought. In the beginning i couldn't get a debugger attached to the game because of the anti-cheat protection but managed to get around it with scyllahide. Also cheat engine was a huge help with scanning memory regions.
I never said there weren't, but they're not the majority lmao. look at any Nazi meet in modern times. And the look at unique visitors to the chans. Further, Nazis can go to any site on the internet. Christianmingle, tinder, Reddit, YouTube, twitch. The Chans aren't different or special.
Honestly. At least 4chan has actual discourse and isn't a complete circle jerk. That being said 4chan is pretty fucking pozzed by now. Alt Chans even if they're dead are better for actual discussion
Careful now you'll be called a Nazi like I've been!

Yeah, it is Reddit after all. Honestly this site is only good for the few dissident subs left and shit like this sub and a few others Either way, a Redditor calling me a Nazi is pretty much a daily activity, but when your politically illiterate what else is to be expected?
&gt;The Chans aren't different or special. The chans *are* special. Specifically because of the reasons I mentioned before. &gt;but they're not the majority Quite the opposite. Might have been true 10 years ago, but pretend to allow Nazis and you eventually will be swarmed by them. For fuck's sake open your eyes and see the idiots posting "studies" and "sources" and finding ways to harass people like Anita Sarkeesian.
I don't know how PC culture has anything to do with this. Nazis are the scum of the Earth. I would hope that that would be universally agreed upon, regardless of what they think about PC culture. Besides, is it to so odd to call someone because they post things that are sympathetic to Nazis? I mean, what's the alternative? To just *assume* that they're posting something sympathetic to Nazis just to be edgy? Where does it stop? Do we just *assume* that someone's not a Nazi even if they say "all Jews must die," or "Hitler was right?" Besides all that, I don't see how calling someone a Nazi is avoiding confrontation. Calling someone a Nazi is probably one of the most vile things someone can say about someone else.
God you're delusional. If you look at ants with a microscope they look bigger and worse than they are. Stop drowning yourself in this shit and making it a center part in your life. It only seems that bad to you because you're entrenched in looking for it and calling people Nazis
What does GG have to do with any of this?
Hey, how do you feel about Anita, by the way? Or Zoe Quinn? I'd like to know that.
And yet you are prepared to do it so freely. Has no meaning anymore with how little it takes to be deemed a nazi
Meh. Mostly irrelevant. Both have done harm to the gaming industry and gaming journalism. Both are dishonest. But pretty much "literally who"s now a days. Most of what they have done is irrelevant except some of the harassment shit that Zoe has done
The user I replied to is into GG, making it quite clear that they have a reason to downplay/cover up the alt-right shit and literal rampant nazism in chans. That's been GGs schtick since day 1.
Calling someone a Nazi for expressing a few Nazi ideals is politically illiterate. End of discussion. I do not say that because someone is a Bolshevik that they're concerned with social justice in the broad sense Because there are Marxist who completely denounce the ideals of the mainstream left that seeks to destroy bigotry-- there are leftist bigots. And in the same vain there are people like me who completely disagree with the fascist use of government but I'm called a Nazi for daring to give a shit about white interest. I'm put in the ever expanding definition of Nazi for caring about my own people. But BLM is exempt from such a double standard. See why your a political illiterate? The Nazi ideology encompassed a lot of ideals, to call someone who shares those ideals a Nazi is outright stupid and diminishes the punch that the accusation has
&gt;Both have done harm to the gaming industry and gaming journalism Such terrible sins. Punishable by harassment. &gt;"literally who"s Oh god I completely forgot about this shit. I remember people using it exclusively for Brianna Wu. &gt;the harassment shit that Zoe has done Jeez the projection.
&gt; muh hairassment &gt; jeeze the projection I mean. You can look into it yourself.
anybody done this for reddit?
I agree with you on most of those points, except for the comment on caring about white interests (that's a pandora's box that I'm not going to open). But I think you misunderstood me. I'm not talking about calling someone a Nazi just because they agree with certain broad and far reaching Nazi ideals. I'm talking about those who explicitly identify with the Nazi party. Swastikas, Hitler, Jews, the whole shebang. If you identify *explicitly* with the Nazi party of Nazi Germany and the Holocaust then there's not really two ways about it. That group carried out a number of atrocities and held certain beliefs that, if you identify (again) *explicitly* with that group, I think it's fair to assume that you also support.
I'm developing a Reddit-like forum in Flask, still very barebones, I'm implementing voting now :)
&gt;And yet you are prepared to do it so freely. I mean, yes? If someone says "I support Nazis" or performs an action that's the equivalent (posting Swastikas for example) then I will assume that they're a Nazi. Just like if someone says "I'm an account" I'll assume that they're an account, or if someone says "I like cars" I'll assume that they like cars. &gt;Has no meaning anymore with how little it takes to be deemed a nazi I don't agree with that necessarily. Supporting certain ideals or associating with a group doesn't take a whole lot of work. I think you may be overcomplicating it.
And you're willing ignoring the blatant contradictions you've stated just so you can get a moral superiority complex/ego boost over calling people nazis to shut them up.
Currently learning the basics of pandas and matplotlib for data analysis.
I'm being completely honest right now: that's not what I'm trying to do. I'm not calling you a Nazi, nor am I discussing *you* at all, since I don't know anything about you. I *can't* because the only thing I know about you is the several comments we've exchanged. I would love to know how you were able to know what you're saying about *me* from the couple of comments we've exchanged. I'm discussing the points you made. Going with that, can you please describe the "blatant contradictions" I've made? Because (again) being totally honest right now: I don't know what you're talking about.
Neat. Commenting so I can come back and check it out
I’m trying to get some tutorials posted on growthtesttube.com. Project based stuff. Let me know if it’s too complicated/obtuse/whatever if you decide to check it out
/r/learnpython sidebar probably. If you have ideas for projects you’d want to try let me know and maybe I could walk you through one
This entire thread started because I had the audacity to say "Most people on 4chan are shitposting or edgeposting. Not many are actually nazis. Grow a spine". And here we are in this comment chain with you justifying calling a broad range of people nazis. Callin people who aren't nazis nazis removes the edge that calling someone a nazi should have. Can't just slap it on everyone who browses one of the top sites of the internet because you don't agree with the fact they make FUN of people who call them nazis and post more of it to trigger everyone. It isn't being "apologetic" and if you can't get that, then get your head out of your ass. this comment chain is fucking retarded. Thanks reddit.

Hello there
I mean, I've already addressed most of the points you've made. Maybe it's not apologetic. Maybe most aren't actually Nazis. But the thing isn't you can't *tell*. And if you're pissing people just to piss people off, then that's something else entirely. Besides that, I never called everyone on 4chan Nazis. I only said that if you post something that could be reasonably construed as supporting Nazis (regardless of the intent), it's perfectly reasonable to think that they're Nazis. That's it. Your point about "removing the edge of calling someone a Nazi," is beside the point entirely. Granted the assumption I'm making here is that most people don't consciously perform actions that could be construed as supporting Nazis - that you have to make a conscious effort to do so.
No you're just delusional and twist shit to being construed as nazis. Standard PC culture cancerous internet bullshit. nothing special here
.... This doesn't sound like this is asked with good intentions... why do you need 10000 accounts?
Would you like to get arrested? Oh really well just run this script..
In bash from your venv you can run `pip freeze &gt; requirements.txt` then give that with your code and when setting everything up run `pip install -r requirements.txt`. That install all dependencies for your project.
Thank you very much! Really saved me.

I don’t know about “often,” one of the most common import statements is “from matplotlib import pyplot as plt”.
Matplotlib was pretty daunting to me at first, but once I figured out the crazy syntax I'm able to make a lot of pretty cool charts. You can also use Seaborn to set up some stuff and then access the low level Matplotlib APIs.
I just want to see if it actually works. People always say in the comments of famous people "I can get you 10k followers if you DM me" and stuff like that but I dont think its real. If I can code it then I will believe it. Thats what I say about most stuff that requires coding.
&gt; Calling someone a Nazi for expressing Nazi ideals is politically illiterate. So calling someone a Nazi, for being a Nazi, is politically illiterate? Wut? do you even hear yourself when you speak?

Pretty good mindset to have
Irrelevant, OP is the consumer of the dict
&gt; Yeah, I’m aware of what property is for... what it’s not really for is dynamically running dict keys. That is *precisely* what `property` is for, the only catch is that the dict has to be `class.__dict__` (or a superclass). How do you think attributes work in the first place? Class attributes are key:value pairs in a dict. So are properties. Why does your class called "Lazy" *eagerly* return items? Are you using Python 2? If your aim is to match the behaviour of Python 3 as close as possible, `items()` should return a view. I'm be honest, I don't know how to return a customized view, but we can get at least part way and return an iterator instead of a concrete list like Python 2: def items(self): return ((k, v() if callable(v) else v) for k, v in super().items()) If your aim is to match the behaviour of `property`, you ought to try matching the descriptor protocol, not just blindly test for callables. CC. u/swiftlyfalling
&gt; Honestly, at first sight, I thought this WOULD be the simple solution. And I'm pretty sure that while your first attempt at a solution was horrible (using a global variable! ouch!) your instinct is correct: &gt; But, it seems a "dict" doesn't work the way I think it does internally. Hard to say, since I don't know how you think dicts work internally. But I'm 99.999% sure that what you are asking for is completely doable, and probably not that hard. I haven't read the entire thread in your post, but the parts I have read suggest to me that most of the objections to your approach boil down to knee-jerk negativity to anything they haven't done before. "Not Invented Here" syndrome is **huge** in the Python community. They would have made the same objections against `property` back in Python 2.2. "Computed attributes? We don't need no stinkin' computed attributes, this is Python, not Java!" and then write a two hundred line work-around for something that was a three-liner using property. The idea of a dict which obeys the descriptor protocol^1 on key access intrigues me... I think I will add it to my To Do list. Private message me if you're still interested in taking this idea further. ^1 That's how `property` does its magic.
OP is not the consumer of the dict. They pass it to third party code that uses it.
Revolvers don't have magazines.
JFYI, Python bytecode is not standardized, unlike Java, for example. In fact, there are normally changes between versions. For example, [3.6](https://docs.python.org/3.8/whatsnew/3.6.html#cpython-bytecode-changes), [3.7](https://docs.python.org/3.8/whatsnew/3.7.html#cpython-bytecode-changes) and the upcoming [3.8](https://docs.python.org/3.8/whatsnew/3.8.html#cpython-bytecode-changes) all had changes So you should keep track of what version your compiler creates.
What OS are you using? If it's any linux distro just use your package manager through the integrated terminal. For example (Ubuntu): &gt; sudo apt-get install python-pip
I'm using windows
Well, there's your problem! Haha

I've been using Python for something like 20 years. I recently got a new computer at work. I am a GIS specialist, and the current main program still uses Python 2.7. Rather than mess around with Windows' environment variables and stuff, I just installed Thonny to get Python 3. Ran the Package Manager and installed the packages I needed and I was good to go.
It's funny that the other guy understood what I said but you don't. I said sharing ideals with Nazis doesn't make you a Nazi it makes you someone who has political ideals similar to Nazis.

I like that I can google anything I want to do with matplot. The docs on their website though are so obtuse it's hard to make heads or tails without a lot of experience already working with it, in my opinion. For example, let's search the examples on how to make a bar chart. [Woa, wtf?](https://matplotlib.org/gallery/statistics/barchart_demo.html) I love the essence of Altair, but it's not as well documented and I can't google stuff as easily since it's new (literally the only tutorial I've found is a video from pycon from the guy who developed Altair). It also doesn't handle large amounts of data well. I just bounce from seaborn and matplot. They all kind of suck in their own way.

Atom is bloated too, given its use of electron. You're basically running a web browser to edit your code instead of running a plain old code editor. That said, Atom is still my favorite
PyCharm takes up about 700MB - Atom is somewhere around 200MB I think. I might give VS Code a try, I saw the grid layout and that's awesome. (You can resize and everything) and it's pretty light as well.
Try thinking of factorial as a math equation.. n! = n * (n-1) * (n-2) * ... *1 Given n all you have to do is subtract from n til you get to one and mult the results together. However, a simple rewriting of n! makes for a great example of how you can solve the problem using recursion.. fact(n) = n * fact(n-1) Relating to your code, though, you will need to define N in your main method, as well as define fact(n) both as variables to print them. Your code currently does not know what you're doing because variables like N and factorial are not defined in main. You fix this by assigning variables to the output of your functions, which must use "return" to pass their output back to main
Matplotlib is cancerous, but depending on your application libraries like Pillow, rasterio, seaborn, or plotly can help by abstracting away from some of plt's insanity

Like the /r/TheBoldTide said, there's Docker integration, plus there's DB visualization, good debugging (with a built in python console with the same namespace as your pause point) and many many more.

Now that the weekend has rolled around I spent some time reading the bytecode compiler source to figure out when this behavior changed, since I was seeing it in Python 2 but not in Python 3.7. And got a bit lost in the code and recruited help from `#python`, where a couple luminaries (runciter and nedbat) humored me as we dug into it. Turns out the change that makes this not work anymore is very new -- it works in Python 3.6! It just doesn't work in 3.7. The reason, if anyone's curious, is the addition of [this code](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/3.7/Python/ast_opt.c#L312-L334) in the AST optimizer. In both 3.6 and 3.7, the statement `a, b = 1000, 1000` will produce this abstract syntax tree: In [1]: import ast, pprint In [2]: node = ast.parse("a, b = 1000, 1000", mode="exec") In [3]: pprint.pprint(ast.dump(node)) ("Module(body=[Assign(targets=[Tuple(elts=[Name(id='a', ctx=Store()), " "Name(id='b', ctx=Store())], ctx=Store())], value=Tuple(elts=[Num(n=1000), " 'Num(n=1000)], ctx=Load()))])') But when we compile all the way to a Python code object and inspect the `co_consts` of that code object (this is where the bytecode compiler stashes any constants from a unit of code it compiled, in a tuple so that the bytecode can refer to them by index), we see the difference. Here's Python 3.6: In [1]: code_obj = compile("a, b = 1000, 1000", filename="whatever", mode="single") In [2]: code_obj.co_consts Out[2]: (1000, None, (1000, 1000)) And here's 3.7: In [1]: code_obj = compile("a, b = 1000, 1000", filename="whatever", mode="single") In [2]: code_obj.co_consts Out[2]: ((1000, 1000), None) In Python 3.6, the compiler built up `co_consts` by going over all the literal constants, inserting each one. Which meant duplicate entries for the members of that `(1000, 1000)` tuple: the first entry in `co_consts` is a standalone `1000`, while the last entry is the tuple of `(1000, 1000)`. If you'd had `a = (1000, 2000, 3000)`, you'd have gotten a `co_consts` of `(1000, 2000, 3000, None, (1000, 2000, 3000))`, for the same reason. Python 3.6 was smart enough^1 not to need to store three `int` instances of value `1000` to do this, but it still increased the number of entries in `co_consts`. In Python 3.7 the optimizer recognizes that it's going to compile a tuple containing all constant values, and that `make_consts_tuple` function just builds the whole thing in-place, resulting in a single entry in `co_consts` instead of one entry for the tuple and one for each of its members. For this specific example -- a tuple of constants which all have the same value -- it's a slight regression because the way `make_consts_tuple` works means it can't guarantee it will re-use the same `int` object twice when creating the `(1000, 1000)` tuple. But for most cases it'll be an improvement because `co_consts` will need fewer entries to do the same job. This is also why it worked for other types -- `a, b = 5.0, 5.0; a is b` would work in 3.6, for example -- in older versions of Python, but doesn't anymore. --- ^1 I say Python was smart enough to know this, but I suspect it wasn't a deliberate optimization; under the hood, the co_consts tuple is actually built up using a `dict`, which means it should always only end up with one entry whenever multiple consts hash equal, and there do appear to be some manual checks in the compiler to work around possible edge cases that come from that.
Great!

It would be more of a challenge! Because reddit's split into a ton more 'boards' than 4chan is. But it could probably be done if you have a substantial enough catalog of subreddits that exist r/all couldn't really be utilized, because subreddits can opt not to be in r/all
Building an NBA prediction analysis model. Main idea is to webscrape data from NBA.com/stats and use my custom algorithm to analyze how each player’s major stats differ from night to night compared against their season average. I then plan to take that data and use it to create the prediction model by using the earlier computed data which shows the player’s statistical fluctuation to accurately(hopefully) predict any given player’s stats for any given night. Once I am able to judge the efficiency of the model and adjust the prediction algorithms for more realistic results I will then have it predict the winning team for every match up by adding up each player’s predicted Points for that game.

Out of curiosity, what is your project? I started doing programming professionally 1.5 year ago after a career as a scientist. The thing I've taken to me more than anything, is writing classes. It's just so useful to have an object with your data and a few methods to work with it. And remember that one class can take another class you've built as an argument. I highly recommend Dan Bader. I'm following his email subscription. I also saw a clean code for python on github which was quite good. I think many of the things you mention are important. Start by learning git and create an account on e.g. github.
next step is pytorch or tensorflow

No, it’s not what **property** is for. OP is setting values in the dict that are functions. They’re _not_ attributes of that dict and the aim is _not_ to mimic the behavior of a **property** and act like a concrete value, removing any cause to use descriptors. They’re meant to behave precisely like the first class functions they are, only they’re supposed to be called at the last moment before consumption. Now, conceptually, these lazy-evaluated callables can be thought of as properties of the class the dict is a proxy for, but it’s abusing **property** to make unbound attributes of that non-existent class in what is really just an intermediate representation of the concrete JSON data OP is after. So I used a list as an admittedly quick and dirty way of shoe-horning callable values in a dict into lazily -evaluated values in JSON, which is OP’s ultimate goal. And I did mention that it wasn’t ideal to do this precisely because it no longer behaves like **dict.items**. The **dict_items** object _is not_ an _iterator_ however (it doesn’t export `dict_items.__next__`), and it is inexhaustible and has a length, meaning that it’s very list-like and returning anything not list-like is inappropriate. I’m not entirely certain a custom view even can be created in pure Python, I’ve certainly never tried, nor seen anyone else try it. But chasing that is a red herring, as OP doesn’t actually _need_ what they’re asking for... OP just wants a class that can be made concrete for JSON-encode at the last second, and OP controls that last second (they want to capture the moment the request is made with a payload, not the precise moment the request gets around to JSON serializing that payload), so this whole discussion is somewhat moot.
Thanks for your rec re github. My project is a stock trading model. I download data from a provider, process it, then send trades to a brokerage through an API. I do make use of classes already but I wonder if I'm making full of them hence the want to read more about using classes than what's in a typical intro to Python. You saw the book Clean Code for Python on github? I don't follow.
Suggestion: use the bytecode library for code gen instead. It's cross-version, battle-tested and maintained by some core devs. I used to write python bytecode generation on my own, but the jump instructions got problematic sometimes(about the label offset calculating). Too many boring tasks you have to do if you do want to it yourself.
The clean code is just a long readme file.
If it smells like shit everywhere you go, you better check your own shoe
I did a similar thing except in bash. But after it got the image it would apply ten random effects from image magic. Resulting images were .... interesting to say the least.
I had the idea of coupling something like this with a Facebook or Reddit post, asking the question "what do you think about this?" and for every visitor, the link shows a different image (but always the same for each visitor, so they don't notice too fast). ... and then watch the confusion unfold when someone really loves his image of a sunset over a mountain range, and someone else gets to see a burning pidgeon instead.

So give me a reason to downvote mine but upvote Pampy. Could the latter match 1/5 of mine in performance, or allow extensibilities? Why?
you could just do '120 i SPC' in vim and it will put 120 or whatever number you want, Instead of this huge function.
Probably a matter of taste but Seaborn is basically the same thing but provides useful wrapper functions around matplotlib code to implement certain types of plots. I find the syntax or interface annoying though if you are switching between matplotlib and seaborn so at some point I decided to just stick to matplotlib, which is actually a pretty good library — not sure why some people dislike it so much

\+1 for Think Python. That was my first python book. All I knew before that was QBasic and a bit of Matlab. &amp;#x200B; I know you said videos seemed slow, but I like watching python talks, especially by core devs. &amp;#x200B; One of my favs is "Stop Writing Classes" [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9pEzgHorH0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9pEzgHorH0) &amp;#x200B; Another good one: "Transforming Code into Beautiful, Idiomatic Python" [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSGv2VnC0go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSGv2VnC0go) &amp;#x200B; Probably just follow RaymondH on twitter. [https://twitter.com/raymondh](https://twitter.com/raymondh). He tweets out interesting python tips pretty often. &amp;#x200B; Of your todo items, version control is the biggest game changer, followed by unit testing. &amp;#x200B; In my opinion "clean code" is a very subjective thing, and comes a distant third to version control and testing... especially if you're just working for yourself. Once you're working with a team, the pressure for clean code increases, but you also get great feedback from code reviews.

Came here to say this
&gt; give me your constructive criticism. (1) The title of the post is too generic and boring and doesn't tell the reader anything. On reading the title, my first thought was to answer "okay: you suck." Learn to write *meaningful* subjects: "NASA image search using Django" would have worked better. (2) With no source code, this could be written in Ruby on Rails, or Perl, or C or Brainfuck for all we know. That makes it literally irrelevant to this subreddit. If you're not asking a Python question, or giving news or information about Python, then its off-topic. "Here's something I'm going to say I wrote in Python, whether I actually did or didn't, and you'll never know which" is just self-promotion. (3) Your thumbnails are *at least* ten times bigger than they should be, which is partially why the page takes so long to load. Typically, you have a 640x640 thumb scaled to 200x200. 200x200 is not exactly what I call a thumbnail but we'll go with it anyway: you force the user to download a 409600-pixel image into their browser (about 60K each), and then scale it to 40000-pixels. 90% of that download is just wasted. With about 100 thumbnails, that's about 5.4 MB downloaded *literally* for nothing. Your mobile phone users are paying for that, and your desktop users are probably wondering why in 2019 [the web is still slower](https://idlewords.com/talks/website_obesity.htm) than [back in the 1990s when we were on dialup]((http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2008/05/why_your_internet_experience_i.html). (4) Not only are you wasting your user's bandwidth, but unless you have permission to hotlink, [you're stealing NASA's.](https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/216363197-How-do-I-prevent-image-hotlinking-) NASA is probably too polite to complain about it but [many people respond to hotlinking in ways that you won't enjoy](https://rudd-o.com/site-news/im-goatseing-myspace). So hotlinking is a bad habit to get into. Unless NASA's explicitly allows you to hotlink using their thumbs, just don't. And even if they do, you may not want to serve up NASA's enormous fat thumbnails when you could serve up nice lean 150x150 pixel thumbs and stop wasting your user's bandwidth.

This was an interesting coincedence from the initial conditions. It would properly be ripped apart as I think it gets closer than the roche-limit allows for, but to incorporate that is beyond my skill level... for now ;)
Think of it as just breaking down a for loop into one line. For example: myList = [] for i in range(10): myList.append(i) #simple for loop that makes a list [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9] could be broken down to myList = [i for i in range(100)] # ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ # your for loop myList = [i for i in range(100)] # ^ # myList.append(i) in a more complex situation you my want to add an if statement myList = [] for i in range(100): if i % 2 == 0: myList.append(i) #for loop that makes a list of even numbers from 0 to 100 is the same as myList = [i for i in range(100) if i % 2 == 0] # ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ # again you have your normal for loop from above myList = [i for i in range(100) if 1 % 2 == 0] # ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ # conditional statment that decides whether i is append to list or not this can obviously be increased in complexity very fast. Take a few examples of code I've made recently [path for sub in [[os.path.join(w[0], file) for file in w[2]] for w in os.walk(dir)] for path in sub] #takes a directory and gives you ALL files with full directory and [elem.find('div', {'class':'url'}).text for elem in [master.find('div', {'class':'properties-box'}, recursive=False) for master in BeautifulSoup(open('C:\\Users\\%s\\Downloads\\Inspect with Chrome Developer Tools.html' % getpass.getuser(), 'r').read(), 'html.parser').find('div', {'id':'pages-list'}).find_all('div', {'class':'row'}, recursive=False)] if elem] #kinda just a joke honestly but it works. It takes an html file from chrome and gives you a list of all open tabs using BeautifulSoup and getpass &amp;#x200B; Conclusion: List comprehension is pretty easy once it clicks in your brain but can still be a bit of a learning curve. If you need any more help or I didnt explain well enough, feel free to ask.
Impressive. Must impressive. #pipinstallnow
The difference is not only aesthetic. `print` as a function can take some extra arguments, in a consistent fashion. Probably it also got rid of some unnecessary internal code, which isn't obvious to the user but is generally a maintenance win. &gt; So, why was it so urgent or necessary It wasn't urgent or necessary, just decided to on balance be a better choice. Python 3 was breaking backwards compatibility anyway, this isn't the issue that led to the split.
For the consistency. More the special case and more the headaches.

How about doing it based on real planets and stars? Maybe not our own solar system as that is probably done hundreds of times before, but you can find datasets of other solar systems and turn them into physical models. Eventually you can create your own playground. Another thing you can possibly add is other space objects such as comets and astreoids. This looks like a very interesting project.

You can't I tried it.

This is answered before on countless posts in this subreddit and others. Python is a general-purpose programming language. It has an excellent community and that brings in amazing open source projects and packages. This is to say that you can do nearly anything with it, perhaps in less time than you would do with other programming languages. The place I suggest you start is looking at your own life &amp; hobbies. What is something you find interesting? (This could be anything.) Also go to GitHub and search for things like “Python Beginner Projects” etc. and build up gradually.
🤔But a solution can be implemented right
The Python devs explained their reasoning for this change in PEP 3105: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3105/ When you want to replace `print` calls with something else, like a proper logging framework, it's a simple find-and-replace. You don't have to deal with adding parentheses and commas or the special `&gt;&gt;` syntax. If that's too much, you can even override `print` within a module by writing `def print():`. Second, from a language design point, statements should only be invented when something can't be done any other way. (e.g. `def` and `del` can't be implemented as functions.) `print` should have been a function from the beginning - so, since Python 3 was breaking backwards-compatibility anyway, they might as well do it then.
Try cx\_freeze or wine.
I started working on a library of shell scripts for converting Python projects to pip packages. Funny enough, I think I'm going to turn this into a pip package itself, but it originated from my own struggles (lol) in understanding the package structure. https://github.com/caseyjohnsonwv/pip-package-generator
Pyinstaller works just fine on Linux, however if you want a windows compatible version you need to do this on windows. I just use a Windows VM to do it.

Hi man! Toy projects its the best way to learn quickly. Cause u will find applicability to your ideas .
This seems to work... what did I miss? class PropertyDict(dict): def __getitem__(self, key): return self.convert(super().__getitem__(key)) def __repr__(self): return "{}({})".format(__class__.__name__, super().__repr__()) def items(self): return [(k, self.convert(v)) for k, v in super().items()] def convert(self, v): if isinstance(v, dict): return __class__(v) elif isinstance(v, property): return v.__get__(v) else: return v cc: u/yawpitch, u/stevenjd
U misunderstand the purpose. It isn’t to insert 120 spaces. It’s to ensure the lines width is at least 120 spaces, so what u need to insert is (120 - line-width - 1) spaces, of course accounting for negative use cases. Which of course if u can tell at a glance what the width of the line is u could do in regular vim, but I can’t do that very well (mentally)
Ugh, technicalities. "Clip" then.

If modules and underlying libraries weren't such a clusterf then the question wouldn't be so common. It's perfectly reasonable for an end user to expect one file to be 100% self-contained and self-sufficient. If not one file, then one folder. (Thus, the Apple .app system.)

That `image = random.choice` bit is too expensive. If you get back a million results, then you’re constructing a million strings and then throwing all but one away. Choose a post and random and then render it.
I made a script a little while back that streams all images coming from reddit in real time. It uses tkinter and changes the image in real time as well. Then I messed around with it a little bit and made it only listen to a bunch of photography subreddits and save any image over 4mb large to my computer. But yeah originally, I got a ton of NSFW images lol. Too many dick pics. Even if you filter out NSFW results using praw, they still come through fairly often. Only way to stop most of it was to make a big list of NSFW subreddits to exclude.
ohh, Got it. Sorry for misunderstanding. I wonder how can we do that in vim
Hi! What do you mean?
It tends, but not always, to be the people who are newer to a language or programming in general. I definitely was one of these people. It's until you realise that you need to base the language you use on the project your doing. If you want a program that can be distributed and used as an exe, you go for a compiled language and if you want something that you can easily tweak and change on the fly, you go for an interpreted languages such as python. At least that's my view of it.
I had a ton of issues with Pyinstaller. One of these was "Hidden imports" that and I think my env had modules which didn't exist in my base install(?) or the other way around. It's been a while since I used it, though. If you're not importing matplotlib directly e.g using Bokeh/ggplot/plotly or something similar then you might need to open up the .spec file and change the hiddenimports =\[\] to hiddenimports=\['matplotlib'\] I had to use hiddenimports=\['xlrd','openpyxl'\] for something I was using Pandas for. &amp;#x200B; Then at the command prompt instead of typing pyinstaller myfile.py Type pyinstaller myfile.spec I'd recommend using the -F flag too for portability. You'll end up with one bigger .exe file at the end but it'll be just one file rather than the .exe &amp; umpteen dependencies in a folder. pyinstaller -F myfile.spec
Is there any way to create executable for MacOS?
It comes too close to FUMIO, så the gravitational force from FUMIO is stronger than that from the sun. That's how the moon is in orbit around the Earth. But I don't think FUMIO-Gormgantua constellation is stable.
This process is pretty cool and usually reliable, but it also fails every now and then. I'm currently contracting for a friend to make a Reddit posting bot using the PRAW library, and after compiling it into an exe file, I realized it didn't work. I checked all over stack overflow, and other people who worked with PRAW and PyInstaller had similar problems, and their diagnosis was that they are simply incompatible and it's best to find an alternative (I've turned to simply running the Python script directly on my friend's computer). :(
I think you'd be entertained by https://github.com/alexmojaki/sorcery
Thank you. This project was just so to learn some Python, so I never really had any plans with it beyond this. I think in order to you have to incorporate the planets own rotation.

Well, there’s the bit where like me you’re returning a **list** rather than a **dict_items** _view_ in PropertyDict.items. But also see that part where you have to do `v.__get__(v)`? That’s where the use of **property** seems to gain you nothing while costing you complexity. In your original post you seemed to want to write your custom dict with just a callable in the key position, then you drifted off towards the idea that a property would work here. i swear that’s a rabbit hole you don’t really want to go down in the practical use cases you’ve described, but okay, here’s the same thing but it handles either form: class PropertyDict(dict): [...] def convert(self, v): if isinstance(v, dict): return __class__(v) if isinstance(v, property): return v.fget() if callable(v): return v() return v def a(): return "a" test = PropertyDict({ 1: "a", 2: property(a), 3: a, }) assert test[1] == test[2] == test[3] ... what exactly is the _gain_ of having to decorate your callable value with **property** (or a function that returns a property)? Since it’s not bound to anything it makes for an awfully strange interface, as the whole descriptor mechanism will never be invoked “naturally”, since there’s no attribute style “dot” access to the unbound value. But what you’ve got will work for the — seemingly weird and brittle — comparison and JSON encode, it just isn’t a “proper” subclass of **dict**, since you’re not getting back a view into the `PropertyDict.items()` when you would still do so with `PropertyDict.keys()` and `PropertyDict.values()`.

This uses windows .net libraries so probably impossible. Why are you trying to compile it on Linux when it runs on Windows? You wouldn't even be able to test properly.
I've been a bit hesitant to share because I'm not done, but I've been working on a book of Python programming exercises to teach test-driven development and introduce (what I think are) interesting ideas and algorithms. This material is drawn from the classes I've taught and I'm trying to publish this material. I'm happy to share with you if you'd care to give me feedback or if you simply find it useful. There are currently 38 or so chapters, about 9 of which are incomplete. If a chapter has a "discussion" section, it's mostly complete. Good luck! https://github.com/kyclark/playful_python

It just iterates over and over again while trying to perfect the value of the synaptic weights, then it uses those to do something with sigmoid to effect the outputs, however i cant think of what exactly it does since im not at my computer atm
why would anyone want to do this?
I meant the computational power of the pi. The os is raspian. But the pi is very slow and has low poer in general, so how will you train more complex networks?
An alternative to this could be [PyOxidizer](https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) - it is a quite young project, with first release just three weeks ago.
Is it possible to make .exe for Windows in Linux? Because I tried a conversion in Linux and I saw .so file instead of .dll file.
I can explain why I want to use this program. I wrote an algorithm for my colleagues; however, they can't use python interpreter. I think that they can use my program without python thanks to py to exe.
Cylinder. 😁
There’s probably a way. But I never took the effort to really master vimscript so I can’t say. If your using neovim u can write a plugin in python, I haven’t looked into that either, but I’d assume it shouldn’t be much harder than on emacs.

Both PyTorch and Tensorflow are deep learning frameworks that ease the process of building models and training them. For example, a simple one layer neural net with a sigmoid is written in PyTorch as `hidden = torch.nn.Linear(input_dim, output_dim)` `outputs = hidden(input_vector).sigmoid()` It's extremely useful! I would recommend PyTorch but I've heard great things about Tensorflow 2.0.

If you make a python application and want to distribute it to other people, it's a lot easier to hand them one self contained file that they're familiar with than trying to explain how to go download not only your program, but the interpreter and any extra modules you might have used.
Cool,I will try it.
The If statement should be: if letter == “O” or letter == “Q”: ...
It's because that statement isn't being evaluated the way you think. ``` if letter=="O"or"Q": ``` when you really want ``` if letter=="O"or letter == "Q": ```
Looks awesome.
What's this have to do with Python?
What you wrote actually translates to: if (letter == “O”) or (“Q”) In other words, it evaluates “Q” as a Boolean expression, and since “Q” is a non-empty string, it evaluates to True. Thanks to Boolean logic, the logical statement “some-statement or True” is always true.
I'm so confused on a few levels. Why here? Why post this in general? It seems like you're baiting someone to link you something.
It works if you do: if letter == 'a' or letter == 'b' : It's because otherwise you ask whether 'b' is true or false. And it should return true if the string is nonempty AFAIK.
aha so the 'if' statement always evaluates "Q" by itself as True because it's a string?
Aha okay thank you!
Thanks! I like this one a lot. For some reason I thought it was ctrl + space + space though.

Is pyoxidizer any better than this?
That is because Python is now used for various purposes than just doing automation. I recently saw some POS written in Python. If I developed that I don't want my clients to install Python themselves, who knows what they will even install. Bundling to an .exe or a setup is a good idea.
You might be a bit late...
OK. Nod. (Pretending to understand it 😂)
Single file mode is also useful for PyInstaller, or just do multi file and put all in an installer :)
Very nice indeed. Reminded me of Snoop Dogg hehe.
Hey, this is actually a pretty nice take on the moving ML into production. I would say that it's a bit too low level for the title (figured it would be more around the ops, but it's posted on /r/python so I guess it's my bad). Having had to move ML into prod quite a few times, it can be a real mess.
Nothing good, yet seaborn literally uses matplotlib to make it’s plots. It all comes down to the API you like. A lot of the complaints about matplotlib come down to the default plot style from 5 years ago that took too much work to look good. It’s not like that anymore.
I'm not using matplotlib. But I'm importing nltk and it's giving me some errors regarding the nltk\_data which I haven't figured out yet.
That’s sounds like a package incompatibly on your machine. I never had that issue. If you really want to make matplotlib inconvenient, install PySide2 and not tkinter.
They didn’t really copy the Interface. They gave Matlab users an API that is familiar that is not the real API. There is a much better API.
if blown is a type, you have to use "is". &gt; Mind is blown
I can only train this one up to 90 thousand times, so honestly idk lol, i might consider getting a pi 4 but im not even sure if that would help to much tbh
That sounds great! I might get it someday, thanks!
What's your age?
Thanks to that link, I learned that there are LOTS of tools to convert a Python script into executables. And the PyOxidizer maker is not claiming that his solution is the best for every situation, helpfully pointing out the strength of other methods.
&gt;defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(dict)) OP's goes 1 layer deep; yours only goes 2 layers. You need ```python from collections import defaultdict def nested_defaultdict(*args, **kwargs): return defaultdict(nested_defaultdict, *args, **kwargs) ```
PyCharm has a built-in tutor! Just use that.
No you wouldn't, you'd use isinstance(). 'is' is a direct alternative to '=='.
tkinter is in the standard library, isn't it? You can't avoid installing it with standard CPython.
The better API is better, but not good. It still has some very MATLAB-esque and other questionable choices which I hope would not be repeated if the library were to start from scratch.
Hey, yeah I tried start with some concepts and then give a bit of Python code to exemplify what I meant. It's a hard balance to strike!
Thanks, I'm glad you liked it! If you set the animation speed to zero and hold click the mouse on the wavefunction, you'll see that this basically just reshapes it. For a non-zero animation speed, any reshaping that you do to the wavefunction immediately gets evolved in time. Note that reshaping the wavefunction may violate the conservation of probability, but I think that this is still a nice feature to have. Also good luck with your endeavours!
You can easily avoid installing it. Just unclick the box on Windows. It doesn’t install by default on Linux.
You're right, it is a silly question. &gt; the difference between these two is merely aesthetic for all practical purposes Why would you say this? What could possibly possess you to make a statement like that, when you very clearly haven't bothered to any sort of documentation? Everyone is entitled to educated opinions, which means you are not entitled to this one. If I said "the difference between the list and the set is merely aesthetic for all practical purposes - one uses parentheses and one uses braces, that's it", I would be wrong, because they do different things. In exactly the same way way, you are wrong to say that the print statement and function do the same thing. I am all for helping people who come to the appropriate place for genuine, good-faith questions, but that's not what this is. What you've done is made a stupid, arrogant statement based on a willful ignorance of the facts; you couldn't even be bothered to look at the documentation for the print function before forming and sharing this opinion as if you know better than the developers.
You'll need a GPU for serious training.

&gt;It doesn’t install by default on Linux. Is that true? I just spun up a clean environment from pyenv and could `import tkinter` fine.
&gt; 'is' is a direct alternative to '=='. I'm pretty sure this is wrong. `==` checks for equality of values, while `is` checks for equality of *reference*. Basically, you can have two identical objects and `==` will say they're the same while `is` won't IIRC. In a lot of situations they may function the same, but they still have different behavior.
Word it any way you want, what’s the answer? Why so sassy
Well.... That escalated quickly.
I think it’s fine. It’s Matlab-esque because they’re trying to make a plotter. It comes down to what you think is intuitive. If you’re comfortable with SQL coming to R (a programming language) makes way more sense and is more expressive and efficient. If you’re not, it’s weird. So is it better to be weird for most people starting out or is it better to make an API for the power user?
Wow. OP asked an interesting question that elicited some interesting answers. No need for the condescension.
You have the package installed. I believe it comes with python-tkinter. It’s not something you can pip install.

Each run the 'Feed Forward' section has to do some recalculations. I haven't worked with tensorflow before -- but looking at the documentation it appears the results can be saved. I can do that using the save/restore -- but not sure how to pull back out the information to enumerate over the Harvard Sentences. It takes my laptop about 10 minutes to do that part -- so caching it to disk and loading it if the model hasn't changed would be good :). For those who looked at the code -- does this sound reasonable? Its around line 45 that the expensive calc starts.

0. Great appreciation to your works, it's wesome. 1. You used sys._getframe(1), it's evil. 2. the way you get source is similar to inspect.getsource, which is evil as well and relies on the existence of source file. I want to make things working when only .pyc files are available.

I do it with wine - no VM needed
I didn't know that library, thanks! I read the docs and another really useful thing is that you can directly do things like `Instr("LOAD_CONST", 'msg')` without having to deal with the consts tuple indexing, in my code this is hardcoded in an ugly way. Also the labeling is really useful, in my code I had to put a sequence of `NOP` instructions recording the address of the first in a stack, and then I had to come back at that addresses to modify the instructions. With a label it would have been easier. However I like the fact that my code doesn't use any external library and I'm not interested into rewriting my code to use this library since it would be a boring task with no conceptual difficulties. &amp;#x200B; Moreover, I'm curious about your use of this library (and generally into python bytecode compiling), my purpose was halfway between the joke and the didactic. Have you done something "real" with that library?
&gt;OP asked an interesting question No, they didn't. They made a number of factually incorrect statements betraying a failure to make any attempt to find the answer to the (boring, simple) question themselves. &amp;#x200B; "Dicts and defaultdicts are exactly the same; defaultdicts just have a longer name, so why did the idiot developers decide to include them, just so they could write longer words?" is not an interesting question, is predicated on ignorance which can only come from intentionally avoiding the documentation of defaultdicts, and is a waste of everyone's time. That is exactly the kind of "question" OP asked.
Yes, using wine

Looks to be based on 2.7 but [this](https://www.andreafortuna.org/2017/12/27/how-to-cross-compile-a-python-script-into-a-windows-executable-on-linux/) should get you on the right path
If you're using IDLE, hit F5. Otherwise if you want to run from a terminal you go "python3 &lt;myCoolFileName&gt;.py". Believe that works on windows as well.
(On Mac) cmd+p shows the function signature too (at least if you're inside parentheses)
Adding to this, `print()` has additional arguments that have been extremely useful to me.
The terminal...? Type " python name_of_program.py " &gt; Enter Or use an IDE like PyCharm or Spyder

You can use an online interpreter. Just type "run python 3 online" in google. Or try repl.it.
Yes, I know. I think my code, as written, should work with python &gt;= 3.6 Actually I only tested with 3.7 and I think I'll stop here, another user in a comment suggested [this](https://pypi.org/project/bytecode/) library, it allows to write cross-version bytecode.
Open the "structure" view of you haven't already. The commands I use the most while navigating a large code base are: - Go to definition - Find usages - Find symbol/class/file - Search everywhere - Open recent file - Rename Customize hot keys for your favorite functions to be easily and comfortably accessible. Things like "delete line", "next/previous tab", and all your most common editing operations. Think about what you do the most and fund a way to bind that to a key. That will save you time and fatigue. Other useful things include VCS integration (e.g. Git), the interactive debugger, running unit tests and doc tests automatically when you save a file, attaching to a remote process, local changes / local history, the excellent diff tool (including smart merge of imports!). My only caution is: don't get overwhelmed with all the things you could do. Take stock of them, pick one or two you think would be most beneficial, learn to use them, and then follow your normal routine while incorporating those new elements. Wait until they become second nature before adding something else. If you change everything all at once, it will be difficult to learn any of them and it will get in the way of actually doing your work.
To be fair, the problem is not really people who do know what they mean.

Okay, I understand your concerns. Adding NOP is indeed a way to resolve label offset calculating, interesting... &gt; Have you done something "real" with that library?

Sorry, but that’s how tkinter works. You can’t delete the os module, but you can just delete tkinter. Your virtualenv assumes you have python. I think thinner is technically part of the standard library, but it’s not always included. That’s part of the basic install.

Bundling whole installer is not necessary. Things we don't need just make the package larger.

Ah ha! fget() is what I was trying to figure out. Thank you for that. And you're right, I think I have diverged quite a bit from having callables to having properties, and probably needlessly. The nice thing about a "property" is you CAN, if needed, still pass a function through (instead of functions always being called), but that's a feature I don't think I'll need. And, for clarification, I wanted a callable the the "value" position of the dict, not the key.

Yep, python's a pretty solid choice for a first language to learn. As for resources, you've got lots of them on the sidebar, both online and offline.

Python all the way!

It depends. If you want to learn programming for data science or Machine Learning then Python is a good option. If you want it for Competitive Programming, C++ is quite handy. For app devlopment, go for Java... Anyways, if you don't have such specifications, then I guess Python is one of the best. The syntax is quite easy and it has a huge community. I started with C (as part of university curriculum) and then moved to Python (by spending a month). There are several courses in Udemy like the Python Bootcamp by Jose Portilla. I did that one. And it was nice. Covered almost every topic. However, you can also search for Python tutorial. Resources are in abudance. After getting used to the syntax, go for practicing in in sites like HackerRank. They have a lot of practice problems on Python. And try to stick to one particular language and keep learning using that. Once you become good at programming it's very easy to shift to another language. And no one prefer an average programmer who knows 5-6 languages over one who is an expert in one particular language. Hope that helps!
Thanks, I recall that one from when I was looking for something that would work in VB6. Now that I'm programming in Python it makes more sense than before. Problem has been there being more than one way, and I was unsure whether there was a single one almost everyone uses. Now that you and m3wolf got me past that hurdle, I'm back to modeling a cortical sheet where it's now best to (as in small brains or cortical folds) have some roundness to it. There are then irregularities that make 5 and 7 sided network places. These may be useful for rounding out the hexagonal shaped traveling waves I'm currently getting. It's a good thing I already have the Lennard-Jones potential all tested and ready to go. That was easier. Next step is to somehow form a cell membrane over all or part of a sphere. Any ides? epsilon = 1 # Energy minimum sigma = 1 # Distance to zero crossing point print("Lennard-Jones potential at radius of 0.01 to 5") print(" i r E_LJ") print("------------------------------------") for i in range(1,501): r=i/100 E_LJ = 4*epsilon*((sigma/r)**12-(sigma/r)**6) # Lennard-Jones potential print("{:3}{:6} {}".format(i,r,E_LJ))

I just push and pull. Not like it's a huge deal. Plus my code is in SCM. I'll have a gander though.
You can run pip from anywhere and it will install in to the currently activated virtual environment. You should have the name of your venv in parentheses in front of your prompt eg: `(tmp_project) PS C:\Projects\tmp_project` With the virtual environment activated you don't need to supply the path to `python`, the venv python will get used. Or you can supply the path eg: `PS C:\virtualenvs\tmp_project\bin\python \path\to\program` and it will use the virtual environment that Python is installed in.

Questions like these are better asked in r/learnpython. What is it exactly that you wanna do? Do you maybe have code that should work but doesn't?
What libraries did you use for this? I would love to see the source.
Because it's true.
Hey! Well, I've also recently invested more time in learning Python and I'm currently using a platform called DataCamp. It's not free, however, it has been working wonders for me. I know you can learn for free but I feel like having an organised course and learning path (plus really good exercises) really cuts off a lot of time spent learning solo, so yea, so far it has definitely been worth the money.
Just cross the threshold and get started. Python is an excellent choice. Once started, the rabbit hole goes pretty deep as you realize the differences between languages and paradigms. Python is batteries included and really popular. Simple and powerful.
Python is great to start. Go in with the mindset that there are many ways to solve a problem, and down the road maybe you'll need to know a different language, but Python can do a lot right "out of the box." For example, maybe you want to get into Arduino. Those are programmed in C, but your foundation of Python will let you quickly learn this new language, as the general principles will be the same.
Yes it’s a good first language because it’s not super syntax heavy and very easy to concept. I recommend looking at documentation and don’t get caught up in the tutorial world. I struggled to learn from tutorials because I never actually put forth effort in solving a problem because the instructor did it for me.
Hey I just used it today. It triggers avast antivirus, I am gonna assume somebody else used it to package a virus and it has the same binaries and such.
just do this a = 5*[[]] a.insert(0, "item) print(a)
&gt;You can look into it yourself. Are you honestly telling me to look into something I was deeply involved with? Are you that dumb?
Hi there. I recently used PyAutoGUI but ran into an issue where .typewrite would send the wrong characters when using keyboard layouts it didn't expect. So typewriting an email adress, the @ could become ? etc. Not sure if it's tough to fix but it would be very helpful :) Thanks for your excellent book on automation as well!
yeah no, can't stand that accent
I disagree vehemently. There is nothing innate about compiled vs interpreted when it comes to distribution - C# and Java are effectively interpreted like Python is, but they have good distribution stories (or even excellent, for C#). The current clusterfuck in Python is just the result of accidents of history, a chaotic ecosystem, and the lack of strong commercial demand. Players in the OS market all have their own horses to back (MS/C#, Apple/ObjC+Swift, Google/"javadroid"+go), they are just not interested in steering a good story for Python; and the community as a whole is just too varied to ever agree on a single way to do it. JS had a similar problem before GitHub put their hands in their pockets to produce Electron.
[Complete Python Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/share/100YEeBkAaclZRRXw=/) is a fantastic resource. I used to avoid paying for anything learning programming related, but found that that course is the best. Never pay anything over $10/11 for the course though.
Yeah fair enough, I do see where you're coming from as the community is very varied and fragmented and that can make it hard to decide on what the best course of action is that pleases the most people.
Does Wine run on Mac too? My windows VMs invariably end up a mess...
Imagine trying to get a parent to install it - would you be able to instruct them to 1) download and install python 2) set up venv (as the may have more projects depending on different versions of packages) 3) install the package from pypi, or worse (if you don't distribute open source) have them install from an index requiring authentication set up 4) have them create a desktop shortcut to execute the script... Or just have them download an exe that can be run. Now, this video describes how to create an exe, along with dlls and other library files - this must then be made installable/distributable - which is not something this video covers.
thanks
Nice. As a fellow recovering Matlab addict and user of matplotlib can I recommend to you the EngineeringFormatter? https://matplotlib.org/3.1.1/gallery/text_labels_and_annotations/engineering_formatter.html You can even use it to format values you a passing to strings so it’s very handy.
PyToApp I believe is a thing
works for me
Pyinstaller can do it no problem
It depends on what your end-goal is. "Programming" is a huge area, it's like saying "I want to learn computers". Once you have a focused goal, it will be easier to determine the best path to reach that goal.
prove it ;)

Yes, OP's statement that the differences are merely aesthetic should've been preceded by an "in my opinion", but nonetheless I found the question interesting. Discussing the reasons behind the design of the python language seems a pretty good use of this sub, imo. Sorry you feel it's a waste of your time. You might find your time better spent by moving on, rather than spending more of it telling OP how wrong they are. 🙂
I find it quite useful by the way.
I don't think so
That’s exactly what pyinstaller does. It bundles python and all the modules into an exe.
yeah, you're not doing what op asked. You're doing `a.insert` instead of `a[0].insert`
I create all kinds of programs for clients. Handing them an exe that just works is important. I’m not going to bust out some c++ books just spend 3 days writing a compiled program that I can code and distribute in python over lunch.
yup seems like you weren't familiar, considering your response. And given everything else you've said, sounds like most of what you followed came from gamerghazi lmao
PyOxidiser doesn’t seem ready for prime time yet. Maybe once they have some doc that show how to compile a reasonably complex program it will be a step ahead of pyinstaller, but not yet.
Yea .exe is so overrated, a.out is the way to go.
Go to [edx.org](https://edx.org), you can take free classes there. &amp;#x200B; Harvard has one [https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x) that includes Python and a couple other languages. Thie one starts...today. I have not taken this one. &amp;#x200B; MIT has one [https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-using-python-2](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-using-python-2) that I have taken. It's already been running a month, so you'll want to wait for the next time it comes up. I \*have\* taken this one, and it's a good class. It uses python to explore computer science, so you learn the language AND get a survey of CS. There is a follow on class it it as well. &amp;#x200B; There are other python classes there, but they seem to focus more on python than on learning to program. Ultimately, as nice as python is for a lot of things, understanding \*programming\* will help you both with python and with knowing when another language might do a better job.
Clearly, you know me better than myself.
Seems that way. 👌
I know its annoying sometimes but its also optional. If a sub doesn't want their posts to be cross-posted (or other posts to be cross-posted on their sub) they can do it through preferences. Its up to the mods of /r/python to decide whether to do it or not. So yes, they can indeed "ban" it if they really want to.
Yes, but it has to be done on Mac. You can’t compile a Mac app from windows.
oh oops i misread, my b.
What do you mean by "control cygwin"? &amp;#x200B; Are you trying to run shell programs from python?
I don’t think pyOxidizer is at the pyinstaller level yet. Once they work out some issues ( or maybe just improve the documentation) it will surpass pyinstaller.
Please also tell me what I'm supposed to like
Well that would depend on whether or not the method is related to the aforementioned class. If the class is called 'Player' and the method does something related to the player, it would make sense to have it within the 'Player' class.

I've never tried it on Mac, but here's the first sentence on the [Wine website](https://www.winehq.org/): &gt; Wine (originally an acronym for "Wine Is Not an Emulator") is a compatibility layer capable of running Windows applications on several POSIX-compliant operating systems, such as Linux, **macOS**, &amp; BSD. Sounds like it's worth a shot
&gt; Can this crosspost bot be banned? My sources say no ;-)
noe avast is just shit and comes up with false positives
&gt; Bundling whole installer is not necessary. Well, that used to be the case until now. In the age of i7 processors and 32 gig RAMs, a 30MB interpreter doesn't sound like a big deal, does it? Besides, there is the chance that your user may install other module developed by you which depends on a new python built-in module. In that circumstance, it becomes much easier to distribute your own single module rather than build a new installer again with your single module plus the new built-in.
OP maybe you are mixing micropython and zerynth... in zerynth you do not need to import machine. I successfully used both with esp32 ( slightly prefer zerynth for lightness and more Cloud/protocol libraries)

As a beginner, I've been watching a Corey schafer tutorial on YouTube on how to set vs code up nicely, and after going through it and then using it for a day, I found I just preferred spyder, which I'd started learning with. I tried to use vs code because the intellisense seems much better than the spyder one. If I could have spyder, with the vs code style intellisens stuff that'd be perfect for me. Also I only do personal little scripts currently so all the git stuff is way over my head and I'm ignoring it for now until I'm actually good at python.

Developing something like that is best left for C# WPF or C++ QT or maybe a Web app. Using python to create complex GUI programs is not the best bet because first of all its extremely difficult to manually position elements and whatnot besides in something like POS, python does nothing special from other programming languages. It only hinders in terms of performance and interfacing with obscure bar code scanning API's. On the other hand I've seen small scientific applications which have been given a GUI with python and that makes excellent sense because in this context python is super useful since they can easily interface scientific python libs and can create simple GUI's swiftly.
Haha, sounds good. &amp;#x200B; When I find more free time, I plan one making mine a full featured IMDB scraping module that will go up on pypi, for now it's just a toy project that I though was just cool enough to show off here.
Pretty cool. Does it have tags search, like Parents Guide or Reviews ?
Yeah good point, I hadn't considered that. I really generalised my statement and didn't consider things like this.
I'm currently working on a little text based game for a friend of mine. It's going great, however I cannot seem to get the following working: I want to transfer a value from one file to another. As seen in the image above my code reads the value of "b" in one file, and also prints it correctly in the shell of another file. The problem which I do not know how to fix: I want to give "valb" the same function as "b" in the other file... can anyone help me with this? I'm not very advanced in this coding language so any help would be highly appreciated! Thanks in advance :)

This version doesn't, but I'm working on building it into a full featured module in my free time. The goal is to have functions to retrieve any piece of information needed from a given page. I'm also planning on adding cast and crew search options so you can look up an actor, see all the information about them, and then navigate through their filmography.
I tried that a while ago, couldn't get it to work, python installer crashed if I remember correctly
Looking forward to it.
Thank you so much. You explained that very nice and clear. Thank you all, understood now.
Thought you guys might be interested. Needed to find away to search for open source projects embedded within others. It generates SHA256 digests and inserts them into the Tinkerpop (Neo4J backend) graph database using gremlin. This adds the file/directory vertices and adds a parent edge for all files in a directory. It then searches through another directory looking for hashes within the original. Using the directed graph it finds candidate parents and presents an average score of how similar the project is to a particularly subtree in the database. The only requirement is docker and I'd suggest using a virtual environment. Builds the Linux kernel in about 2 minutes and takes less than 10 seconds to do a comprehensive search. Not looking for kudos, just people to test it and see if it's useful.

looks good, what about now working on the cli output itself? maybe add some colours and icons. this will improve the user experience. think like vue or npm cli's.
The lack of a reasonably unified way to create an exe with all dependencies is a problem that Python has not solved. PyInstaller is nice but with warts. This is a practical problem for many of my students(adults). They work in a corporate enviroment where they make something useful with Python but are unable to pass it to users who are unfamiliar with Python. It is easy for us to say, just install Python, pip freeze, virtualenv and so on, this is not really an option for end users.
It doesn't need to be better. It's not a competition.

For anyone who was around in the 2.7 to 3.0 move, was the `assert` keyword considered for transition to a function as well?
Amazing work... Thanks for sharing!

I like this one too. It also sets up a new profile for running the code and tries to be intelligent about it. For example it sets a pytest profile if the file looks like a test file. The only thing I wish was default was four shortcuts. One for terminal, one for python console and two more for debug in both. Also, if you ran it one way (i.e. terminal vs console) and it wasn't the saved profile option it didn't modify the profile.
Pretty sure `==` is faster since it'll be done at a lower level.
&gt;Btw new design has it hidden under a menu or something? Probably. I don't know where, though.
The auto import shortcut will be useful for you then. Also, the debugger and DB gui will be nice. As well as deployment options.
I think that is the wrong point of reference. You should be thinking about why you want to learn and what solutions you want to implement or design. You can literally use any programming language as a starting point as they all have similar foundations in terms of decision making, iterations and data structures.
Nice! You could probably forego all of those if statements by making small functions for each conversion then passing the units to those functions. Though I don't think it would fix how many conversions you have to do/add lol, metric to imperial and vice versa is always an annoying case by case thing

Anyone heard of Delphi Object Pascal? Its your geanddads coding platform from 20 years ago and allows aingle exe file on Winsows, mac ,ios Android and Linux. The GUI design is better than any including C# The vendor Embarcadero charges $5000 for it but to be cross platform from a single code base its probably worth it for comercial projects.

I got it working! Your code was helpful, I appreciate it.
This is the main reason I prefer the new \`print\`. The arguments have been very useful.
Udemy is shady AF in my books. They allegedly stole a bunch of content and are reselling it under their brand.
Like with any programming language, you must be willing to put in the time and be consistent. Programming is a fluid art, as there are new features and technologies coming out almost daily. For me, after 3 years, I am still learning and find that I still need to reference documentation. For simple programs, it won't take long, however, for complex intuitive projects it could take much longer. It all depends on the student.
I started learning python last month and it is my first language. After 2 weeks learning automatetheboringstuff.com I was able to: - automate composing .docx reports in a corporate template for my office job using the data from Trello API - make simple Telegram bot - right now working of the script for an automated vertical farm As far as I know, Python is the best candidate for the first language to learn because of combination of simplicity and capabilities

Does Youtube allow the use of youtube-dl?
You're either confusing familiarity with fluency, or Guido calls you daddy.

Python is a brilliant starting language as it lets you learn some programming fundamentals easily, it's very powerful and widely used.
Python is probably the best choice as of today. As a first language, that is. Easy to learn (relatively), it'll give you a working prototype in record times. An insane amount of resources on the web, be it tutorial or packages on pypi (a bunch of code other people wrote to do stuff, that you can re-use in your own program for free 99% of the time). It'll get you started with a lot of more advanced concepts that you'll likely want to use later on. There are few things python can't do, and in still using it after 15 years. If you want to "skip the tutorial" (which I strongly recommend against), Rust is another very interesting language in the current landscape IMO, but it won't be as forgiving to get onboard.
You can read a set number of bytes or a one line at a time in Python. What are looking for?
What part of not backwards compatible is confusing? The part where it means old code may not work?
Any reason you couldn’t do this? import re mdstr = """ &lt;!-- Comment with stuff --&gt; # Markdown title Markdown text """ nocomments = re.sub(r"\&lt;\!\-\-.*\-\-\&gt;", "", mdstr) print(nocomments) This should print: '\n \n # Markdown title\n Markdown text\n ' After which you could use `str.strip()` to handle the extra newlines, or something else fancier.
Then don’t try it out..
OP defined it in their post as &gt; Basically, writing multiple successful instructions, with very little errors. Which should be easy to reach in a day or two if you are skilled in another language.
Make sure you are using the cygwin version of Python. That will give you a lot less grief that trying to use the Windows version of Python. Install the latest Python2 or Python3 package using cygwin setup.
We need to handle multi-line comments and things like fenced code blocks, where a plain regex wouldn't work. I'm not sure anything exists to parse Markdown into a CST, in any language.
Wow, no reason to make it contentious. Asking for a little promotional blurb about what makes this unique wasn’t adversarial. If it’s just a hobby project with no expectations, that’s fine too, just say that.
is good idea start with python as first programming language ? Short answer : Definitely YES, here is not reason why not
That looks like what I was looking for thank you
Which is a pretty reasonable problem to have if you're targeting Windows. You wont get anyone to adopt your product if you tell them that you first have to install python, then open a cmd/powershell, activate the python environment and then use python to run the arbitrarily name entry point script of your program. Source: am python developer with a windows-targeting project. &amp;#x200B; Now that windows will have python built-in maybe distributing these kinds of projects will be easier, but people will probably still prefer having an exe file around.

pyinstaller works. That's saying a lot, since every other tool I tried didn't. It could be better, though. It likes to bundle up a bunch of shit (specially if your project imports large frameworks, such as qt), making your supposedly-50mb project around 600mb. Also, it takes quite a while to build the executable, but maybe that's part of the price you pay for trying to make an exe from a python script. Still, at the end of the day, it solves my problem, so I'd definitely recommend it.

Have you tried google? Literally the first hit for "python wolframalpha error invalid appid" [https://github.com/ironman5366/W.I.L.L/issues/20](https://github.com/ironman5366/W.I.L.L/issues/20)
Interesting and inspiring. Wish you good luck on monetizing the channel!
This is a really cool concept and looks like a nice execution. Thanks for sharing. As a side note, I'd never heard of nightcore before and now that I've heard it, my god it's awful. But that's just like my opinion man ...
No. Unless a video creator specifically states and provides a download link, YouTube-dL is against their Terms of Service. Screw up bad enough, and your Google account will be permanently banned.
Pretty dope babygirl
Can you tell me the exact version of OS, and any language or regional setting you have? Was this a non-qwerty physical keyboard, or did you change some settings in the OS?
Poetry
Awesome
Yea, as someone who likes electronic music, EDM, trance, techno, etc... nightcore is really annoying. Because it's so popular, it ranks highly in searches.
Well it sure is a lot more simple to use ==
You could create a "deck" = list of dicts , the dictionaries beeing your cards like so: dict(number=7, suit=spades) then order your list randomly (shuffling) later you could pop a card inside a cycle and compare you counter against the number in the card and reacting accordingly.
pip-tools
wow that IntagramAPI looks great. thanks for accidentally making me stumble upon that. gj on ur script but try to name your file with something more specific than my_api.py and implement oop concepts and multithreading so you can track multiple accounts at once.
&gt; then using a seq2seq GAN trained on the most watched nightcore videos,it derives a "template image" from the lyrics Could you explained more about this? You run the audio on a computer vision program algorithm and it creates an image of an audio ? Cool project man! Really creative.
 import timeit stmt1 = """ a1 = [1, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21] a2 = [1, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21] a1 == a2 """ stmt2 = """ a1 = [1, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21] a2 = [1, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21] for i in range(len(a1)): if a1[i] != a2[i]: break """ print(timeit.timeit(stmt=stmt1, number=1000000)) print(timeit.timeit(stmt=stmt2, number=1000000)) I gave it a shot with timeit, and it looks like using == takes about 206ms vs 856ms when you run the snippets a million times. The loops version also assumes that the lists are the same length, so if you factor in having to check for length mismatches as well, the == version comes out even further ahead. Like /u/\[zzmmrmn\] mentioned, the speed difference is all about doing things at a lower level. The more you can lean on the C code under the hood of Python, the faster your program will be.
You confused AI with ML, but still very impressive and a cool concept.
umm, just use `pip`? Pip handles dependency resolution: python3 -mvenv venv source venv/bin/activate pip install whatever

Most of the problems I've encountered with PyInstaller are due to inaccuracies in its dependency checker. It mostly does a good job of deciding which files to pull in (DLLs etc.) but it will sometimes (a) miss things, and (b) include things it doesn't need to making the exe unnecessarily large. The solution is to create your own .spec file, which (among other things) you can use to tailor exactly what gets included in the exe. It takes a bit of effort but once the .spec file is set up it's easy to re-package the app if needed. I wrote a somewhat complicated Python app that uses Qt, OpenCV, and FFmpeg. PyInstaller is the most reliable way I found to distribute it.
ML is a subset of AI.
https://docs.python.org/3/ Imho. Start from either Setup and Usage or the Tutorial
Carbon is a "subset" of all organic compounds, but people don't go around calling all organic compounds carbon, do they? The media and tech startups are the biggest perpetrator of misusing the term AI to try and boost sales of a product or due to common ignorance on the topic. Can we all agree that it is important to not call every little thing AI when it is still most likely another decade or two away from reality?
TL;DR. ML is still subset of AI.
Are you using Matplotlib? Couldn’t you plot each of the 54 series on the same axis? I.e. Import matplotlib.pyplot as plt Fig = plt.figure() Ax = Fig.subplots() For I in experiments: Ax.plot(i[Date], i[Val], label=“test”) Ax.legend() Plt.show()
Your response is a good example of ML compared to AI since you don't seem capable of coming up with a competent response on your own (ML) whereas AI would be able to hold an intelligent conversation.
I think OP is referring to the bot in the comments below (the one with a lot of downvotes)
It's okay if not every single little sysadmin has a clue about AI. But ML is still a part of it. That's a fact.
Just being a part of something greater or more complex doesn't make it the same as what it is a part of. You probably think a bunch of "if" and "else" statements strung together signifies AI too, don't you? Since I work as a SysAdmin, which involves computers, by your logic I can call myself an Electrical Engineer, Software Engineer, Security Analyst, etc. Hang on while I go update my business cards and resume now that I'm *awakened* to my apparently inherited abilities and knowledge. /s
I’m still tranced out on Montgomery’s card—the classy coloring, the thickness, the lettering, the print—and I suddenly raise a fist as if to strike out at Craig and scream, my voice booming, “No one wants the fucking *red snapper pizza*! A pizza should be *yeasty* and slightly *bready* and have a *cheesy crust*! The crusts here are too fucking thin because the shithead chef who cooks here overbakes everything! The pizza is dried out and brittle!” ___ ^(*Bot.
