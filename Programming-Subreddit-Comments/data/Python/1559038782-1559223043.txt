Where is the script running? on the router? How did you log the data?
More info please
Can it run jupyterlab?
Multi-threading in python is like building a Jacuzzi with a toy excavator. As soon as you dig out the hole you understand that you need the pipes. when you are finished with pipes you understand that you need the tiles, when you are done with tiles and pipes and every other fucking thing you understand that it can fit only one guy at a time because the toy excavator can only dig so much.
You could just add[a few more lines of code](https://github.com/prometheus/client_python) and have an exporter for Prometheus. From there it’s easy to display it in Grafana.
it runs jupyter fine, so I reckon it can :D
Oooh I’ll try it tonight, then.
Can you expand on that?

According to the (sparse) documentation that is available, it's simply the gtk3+ webview widget, which equates to native webkit on apple, gtk webkit on linux, and Trident/IE on winders for dos. The example code I'm using is bloody simple, here it is: [https://pastebin.com/PtcsQUmb](https://pastebin.com/PtcsQUmb) (It was a few chrs over the reddit limit)
Many people make a living from Python, but I'm going to be honest here: it'll be hard to get hired in the software industry as a homeless guy, and learning up to a level where you're hireable is going to take a while. Maybe look for a different job that can pay the bills while you learn? That should be more sustainable...
So the handler is fast, it receives notifications every second, if that’s what you were referring to. I want to run a function every time I receive notifications but that function could be slower than one second.
Why don't you just buy a home bro
Seriously? Is that your comment? \*uck this world. These people can make "jokes" out of everything.
These graphics are created using Python and Pillow https://www.twitter.com/marswxreport
np.vectorize is essentially the same as a for loop. (According to the docs)
What's the problem with making jokes? You've got a problem with fun?
exactly.. a way u can get away with this if u override the __build_class__ function in the builtins module and make a special case for yourself. or a more simple solution is to pass *args to sigmoid.
Yes, but why is it slow
Basically a lot of math
Your stuff is awesome — very inspiring!
Sometimes you should have enough decency to understand that joking is inappropriate.

I recently took Poetry for a spin when releasing [Flake 8 Markdown](https://github.com/johnfraney/flake8-markdown), and I thought it might be helpful to walk through the process of making a package using Poetry, from start to finish. I found it more straightforward than using `setup.py` and `twine`, which I'd used for other packages. How are you publishing to PyPI these days?
Are the drops drops in usage or service? I want to chart the speeds I receive like this vs the amount of data downloaded.
Maybe Bokeh?
github is having a seizure for some reason. Am I the only one seeing an error?
I am scraping sites that don't have a rss feed and generating the feeds myself using beautifulsoup and request, also saving the complete HTML of websites i visit because python generates far smaller sizes than if I use a chrome extension.
&gt; I recently took Poetry for a spin when releasing Flake8 Markdown, and I thought it might be helpful to walk through the process of making a package using Poetry, from start to finish. What's with all these code of conducts. Are you all scared that some nazi will join your project? I find it a bit funny to be honest. &gt; I found it more straightforward than using setup.py and twine, which I'd used for other packages. I am not sure. They made a mess and I am trying to understand what's the best way going forward, but I am investing more into poetry. &gt; How are you publishing to PyPI these days? I'd go for poetry. I wrote some kind of guide on this topic, but it's in a sort of "temporary state". [I need more study to know if I am saying reasonable stuff or a bunch of bollocks](https://stefanoborini.com/python/2019/04/26/current-status-of-python-packaging.html), but you are welcome to give some feedback, I'd love it.
Eh don't think it's beautiful yet. Utilitarian at this point.
Definitely not. * Labels are too small * Unclear what units the Y-axis is in (probably should be chosen to reduce zeros) * There is a line who's function is unclear (may be regression) * The line should be another color Data is interesting, but not beautiful.
That's what I was setting out to accomplish, but they only allow 500 calls per day :(
Is this cumulative data? Do you have a bandwidth limit on your internet account?
&gt;What's with all these code of conducts. Are you all scared that some nazi will join your project? I find it a bit funny to be honest. I imagine that in 99.9% of cases, people's interactions in a project are going to be professional, even without a code of conduct. Still, I think a code of conduct is useful in at least two cases. It provides some assurance to new contributors that interactions in a repository are going to be respectful and reminds everyone interacting with the project what the boundaries are. Most online communities have them in some shape or form ([Hacker News Guidelines](https://news.ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html), [Reddiquette](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette)). I'll give your post a read when I get a chance later today.
Probably because it's deallocating everything in the list, and that takes time.
Makes sense, thanks.
Ok, but have you (or anyone) ever considered that by prominently adding a code of conduct you are preemptively telling people "you are very likely going to be a prick, so here is the rulebook". As far as I am concerned, it feels like being considered guilty unless proven innocent. You slap the rulebook in the face of those who misbehave, once they misbehave. But sorry, I am taking a tangent. It's just that I've seen this pattern more and more often, and I personally find it a bit unpleasant.
Could you try and borrow a python book from a library or somewhere? I’m assuming you are using library computers to post? You could take random jobs on websites like fiverr while teaching yourself something like Django or flask, even some machine learning if you are up to it. Once you have earned enough through those pages and got enough real world experience, I’d email a bunch of businesses, as I understand many businesses are looking for python devs. Good luck, know that we are all happy to help!
My main problem with modern python is that it has been impossible to code stuff that is future proof. Everything is in such shaky and mutable grounds that you have to change (and relearn) the same stuff every 6 months. Take packaging. First it was distutils, then distribute, then setuptools and eggs, but wait now they are wheels, then a bunch of new stuff came out to handle virtualenvs and then tox and invoke and stop, throw everything away because now it's pipenv time but no don't use pipenv use poetry and what are you doing are you still using setup.py you should use pyproject.toml. I honestly don't know how to create python code anymore.
Nice. I’m not too familiar with Pillow, I know it’s an image manipulation library, but not too much beyond that. I would think the process is pretty similar to how I make mine. I like the Mars weather idea.
is that math being done in python?
Thanks!
The prices of popularity :/
what's with the monthly drops in usage? do you have a data cap?
Will trade upvotes for repo
So you are saying that this is how java programmers felt in the 2000s?
I've not written a significant amount of java code, so I'm utterly unable to give a qualified answer to that. But if there was a huge influx of eager beavers that wanted to put their mark on the language at that time, then probably yes.

I’ve been at python for 13 years. Take packaging. Pick one thing and use it until you have to switch. I’m still using the first packaging tool I learned because it works, which is setuptools. Stop trying to use the new hotness that tries to solve a problem that you can do by hand and understand. What happens when the fancy new thing fails? Can you fix it? Having seen the history of packaging, I’m very happy with the current state. Wheels are incredible. I’m an aerospace engineer, so software isn’t even my field. Keeping up on programming aspects is an extra thing on top of learning how to do say finite elements, which I’ve spent years learning. I manage just fine to stay current.
As it’s only WiFi traffic I’d assume it’s just a packet sniffer.
They specifically pointed out cgi.escape as actually being used and said they would keep it. Never mind that it’s a one liner.
You’re going to need to overwrite the interactivity call. I have a fancy matplotlib tool that when I box select an area, it finds the data inside it and makes sure to use the y range appropriately instead of seeing a flat line. It lets me zoom less accurately.
I think you're being dramatic. It's not necessary to adopt bleeding edge tools and methodologies for everyday coding. What's more, almost no code is "future proof". Sure, Java lasts a long time, but java feature developing is glacial. And "a long time" is relative anyway. I have .net code I wrote ten years ago that flat out does not work today. This is the price of doing business in our profession. You use the tools and patterns you know well until they stop working or you encounter a problem that can be solved better with a different tool. Anecdotally, I have never used poetry and I don't even know what ".toml" files are. That hasn't stopped any of my work.
Does it correlate with pornhub usage?
So did you get a new job, girl, or a hobby that didn’t involve the internet?
Could you please share the code ?
There is no way in a million years that this was not written by the person himself.
Using scrapy to create a labeled dataset. Having fun writing the spiders.
Do not package, use docker images.
I'm working on a few things. I have a flask app that displays metrics gathered from a computer in a modded minecraft world. Decided to do it to learn python some more and get some experience with flask. I'm also researching a way to monitor my servers using psutil. I plan on having all my servers send metrics to a central one. This will let me learn config files as I want to monitor different things on different servers. Ultimately, I want to push both these things with some other metrics to grafana as those dashboards look just beautiful.
Ah dev done strikes again
Looks like they are plotting cumulative usage per month, and then count resets on month end.
ah, that would make sense.
Unfortunately I am rarely the person who chooses the tools. Depending on the team I am put into, I have to relearn things again and again and again, because every team has its own preference.
While that is technically true, it really undersells how powerful it can be. Namely, that it's neat and MUCH faster. Up to 100x faster than a Python for loop and 25x faster than df.apply, depending on what you're doing. There are ways to take it to the n'th degree to achieve speed but the neatness and level of speed advantages are usually suffice for my needs. https://stackoverflow.com/q/52673285
ok thanks i will look into it :D!
By the way, I just read your post and it's beautiful. Thank you.
you are myyyy hero! thank you!
Looks like you got into a relationship, congratulations. Hrhr
Probably just me, but I'd rather have the date format be YYYYMMDD.
Wow this entire mod-sponsored thread flies directly in the face of the policy just quoted to me as the reason for discarding my recent thread.
Hi there, from the /r/Python mods. We have removed this post as it is not suited to the /r/Python subreddit proper, however it should be very appropriate for our sister subreddit /r/LearnPython or for the r/Python discord: https://discord.gg/3Abzge7. The reason for the removal is that /r/Python is dedicated to discussion of Python news, projects, uses and debates. It is not designed to act as Q&amp;A or FAQ board. The regular community is not a fan of "how do I..." questions, so you will not get the best responses over here. On /r/LearnPython the community and the r/Python discord are actively expecting questions and are looking to help. You can expect far more understanding, encouraging and insightful responses over there. **No matter what level of question you have, if you are looking for help with Python, you should get good answers**. Make sure to check out the rules for both places. Warm regards, and best of luck with your Pythoneering!
1: stop listening to whoever is telling you all this. 2: Using setup.py is probably just fine. 3: definitely don't use poetry. It's great but version 1 isn't even out yet. Don't even look at tools for which version 1 isn't out. Now you can use python without any of these problems. If your team doesn't want to follow these steps, well everyone works with frustrating teams.
To chart speed vs total data downloaded, you would need something logging the bitrate for every action you performed. The bitrate would vary wildly depending who’s server you were currently downloading anything from. Your purchased speed is merely a guideline, if your connected to a website / web service with a throttled server, it won’t matter that you paid for 150mb/sec from your isp, because the actual received speed to whom you were connected to called you at 5mb/sec, and this will vary for every new connection you make to any given website.

Thanks very much! I'm glad to hear that you enjoyed it.
I think this is ultimately the technological secret. Now that we have things like Snaps and Docker, etc. You can just take that technology and mothball it and it'll keep working, almost forever. I think some people think that because 3.7 python exists, that their 3.4 installation or even 2.7 needs upgrading. Sure, if you're google and whatever it is is front facing security chasm, but I think risk assessment is pretty understandly lax in many circumstances.
relevant xkcd, is still relevant: https://xkcd.com/927/ You're not going to solve the human side of the equation by telling technology to stop evolving.
1. /r/learnpython 2. Reading memory in an online game is likely to get detected and banned. You might want to screenshot the game instead and use OCR to parse the log.
Ah damn sorry about that, I completely forgot about /r/learnpython. I tried using OCR to parse the log but the text color messes it up.
I got gitlab running on my own server at home. I decided I'd just turn it into an amorphous blob of a "open stack" It's got some nginx front end, and everything sits behind it. If I want to update the nginx config, there's a watchdog running looking at jinja2 templates. It's an ugly thing. But now I can run CI/CD with gitlab and actually stop spending time doing "production" things. But this isn't a production machine, so YMMV.
Is the color fixed? If it is, you could use it to mask out the background first.
I don't see codes of conduct being quite so top-down or adversarial. A pretty big chunk of the [PyPA code of conduct](https://www.pypa.io/en/latest/code-of-conduct/) is how maintainers should comport themselves: &gt;By adopting this Code of Conduct, project maintainers commit themselves to fairly and consistently applying these principles to every aspect of managing this project. Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct may be permanently removed from the project team. I think it's better to present the expectations up front so that there are no surprises, but different project maintainers may feel differently. I hope that a code of conduct would encourage more interaction with a project than it would discourage.
There are only 3 fixed text color that I need to extract from the screenshot, so I can probably do that 3 times to extract all the info I need. That's said, I'm not sure about how to mask out the background first like you said.
What’re you scraping? Do you recommend scrapy for small projects?
In my opinion, you're doing the right thing to have a code of conduct. The fact that stebox describes them as "funny" shows he's too uninformed about the issue for his opinion to have any right to have his opinion taken seriously, five minutes of googling could show him why they're important to many people, especially those already marginalized from contributing to projects. He's free to have whatever opinion he wants, but should have no expectation to be taken seriously when he uses mocking language for an issue that many people take seriously.
Load the image into a Numpy array or something like that, then make all the pixels that are not your target colors white, and make the pixels that _are_ your target colors black.
Alright thanks I'll try that.

One thing that I've been stumping on for a while. It needs to be mentioned in more places that if your 'source' folder is not a snake-case version of your package name (my-package -&gt; my\_package), then you need to have a 'packages' entry to tell poetry where your packages live: [https://poetry.eustace.io/docs/pyproject/#packages](https://poetry.eustace.io/docs/pyproject/#packages) &amp;#x200B; Great article, and I have also found poetry to be an elegant solution to the python packaging problem

That's a good note. I'm a little surprised Poetry doesn't include that section by default. Explicit is better than implicit, after all.
Shouldn't we use pandas or scikit-learn then? Version 1.0 does not mean anything by itself
Neat little project, I'm going to take a closer look. We abuse decorators to do basically the same thing, but the code doesn't grok with most linters/analysers because it's doing things it shouldn't. I like this approach better. Good job!
The graphic is built to emulate what you'd see on TV during the weathercast. Its used by a number of broadcast meteorologists. Even had a student put it in their demo reel.
I should have added that I am using Oracle Is this DB agnostict?
[removed]
Thanks! I actually started this with decorators but moved to descriptors for the reason you mentioned.
I was speaking coarsely, there are exceptions. Version 1.0 means the people that wrote it believes it to be feature-complete and no major changes are coming soon. And conversely if it isn't on version one that means major changes are coming soon. If you are prepared to deal with major breaking changes coming soon, you can use it. If not then you can't. Many teams can't, but use these anyways. It's not even a matter of what you should do. It's a matter of what you can do. You will end up pinned to outdated versions. Essentially having a package that's less than version 1 is a lot more work. If you really believe the gains are worth it, use it. They probably aren't. pandas might be an exception.

Especially when you develop desktop applications like I do, most of which run on a secure network without internet. I build an exe with pyInstaller, which is how I keep my code working 10 years into the future. If I need a VM, I'll make a VM. I'll still haven't figured out docker.
What's the unit of the numbers in the y-axis?
This week I'll be resuming work as the only developer on my company's web app. We use monitoring services to return data on devices that we manage (network infrastructure, user devices, etc.) and lack a good way to display the data together. It can be a pain auditing devices across clients and type, so I'm building a full stack tool to collect and display the data. Using Django for the web front end and Postgres for the backend. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; Similarly, I'll be working on a computational linguistics project in my spare time. I use an IRC backend to collect Twitch Chat data and use some sentiment analysis tools (some mine, some libraries) to vectorize each message. Working through some graph math now but hopefully it'll result in a pretty nice visualization of stream-audience engagement. No web-app yet, but I've got more data than I know what to do with.
Thanks for mentioning [shields.io](https://shields.io)! I hadn't come across it before. In some part of my brain I'd filed the GitHub badges as "fancy magic" and it's immensely satisfying to have that mystery resolved in passing. Great post!
A bit disappointing that nobody was interested in discussing a fundamental problem with scientific software, when so many cookiecutter posts about IDE preferences and people who can't read the sidebar generate so much interest. Anyway, here's an implementation for option 1. It works for rust's crates.io as well. https://pypi.org/project/citepy/
Welcome to PHP 5-7, where changing the returned type of everyday functions breaks everyone's code. The only way to future proof your code is the human mind's ability to adapt to changes and putting forth the work required to update your code to work on new versions.
Use the Twitter api and schedule your script to run from what ever task manger you have on your pc or Mac.
Do you watch a lot of football?
I may be confused on what you are asking, but couldn’t you just use time.sleep() and have it sleep for 5 minutes in an infinite while loop?
would that give you data on other devices on the network, like if he switched to his phone.
I wrote [citepy](https://pypi.org/project/citepy/), which makes it much easier to cite python libraries. Most software involving citations uses the Citation Style Language to abstract over the citation metadata and convert between citation styles. CSL is primarily XML-based, but there is a JSON variant of increasing popularity. Citepy has some classes which are basically just thin wrappers around the CSL-data JSON schema. They're type hinted and fully fleshed out (rather than dynamically generated from the schema, which prevents introspection by your editor), so they're easy to use. The more interesting bit of citepy is a command line tool which generates CSL-data JSON from package metadata on PyPI. So with a single call, you can generate style-independent citation data for every library in your virtual environment, which can then be ingested by a tool like citation-js and converted into bibtex, bibtxt, CSL XML, plaintext or HTML bibliographies. This is only available for python, but for fetching information about specific packages (and specific versions), it's very easy to add additional backends (not just pypi). I've already added rust's crates.io.
It depends how small. If you want to do a big job once, or a little job frequently, it's pretty nice once you get your head round the structure (there's a little too much magic for my taste). However, scrapy is a standalone application, which just happens to be written in and be configured by python. You can't use it as part of script which does other things to the information - you have to run the scraper (which dumps out the data as JSON), then run another script to do something to that data.
I could, but I'd like for the script to be able to run on a server, fully independent of my server. I don't really know how to do that at the moment.
I'd like to be able to run the script on a server, independent of my computer. I'm just unsure how to set that up.
Guess I'll stop writing libraries, then.
/r/learnpython and read the sidebar
Can you give us a clue which files you will be working on, so we can review them ahead of time? (That repository has a ton of files and no readme.)
Thanks for the recommendation! I'm interested, but hesitant. i don't know anything about those tools. Is this a popular, reliable monitoring workflow? How ubiquitous are Prometheus and Grafana? How many users?
Nice. There isn't much out there? I had the same feeling but created an online course and also did this 1-hour webcast on it. Hope it helps someone out there: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F19R\_M4Nay4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F19R_M4Nay4)
What's happened to this subreddit?
Good idea.
Prometheus was originally written by SoundCloud as nothing suited their needs. Integration in Grafana is seamless, you just add prometheus as data source and are done. After that you can add queries in the PromQL language to query the metrics, it’s not hard as it sounds. I use it since some months, but it seems like it is a really common workflow, especially grafana is a standard for displaying monitoring dashboards. There are a lot of videos about Prometheus on YouTube, which let you easily understand how it works.
I'm doing the [tensorflow keras](https://www.tensorflow.org/alpha/tutorials/keras/basic_classification) tutorial to integrate ML-capabilities to [Pythonic](https://github.com/hANSIc99/Pythonic) in the future.
&gt; Because you don't declare the object you can't see it's properties like in Visual Studio with intellisense. You can use type hints for that, and PyCharm will infer types for you to the best of its ability. &gt; It's not obvious for me what are the input arguments in a function, since I can't see what is expected to be passed. is it a class, a string, a integer? You can use type hints for this, too. &gt; PyQT5 seems to have some missing features that exist on the WinForms in VB.net. It seems that it doesn't exist an event that handles when the user clicks on a treewidget checkbox. There's also missing the tag object, which allows for you to add anything inside. [QTreeWidget::itemChanged](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtreewidget.html#itemChanged) is the signal you want. There is no tag field because there is no need for one - Python classes already allow you to add arbitrary attributes, and honestly, doing something like this is a code smell anyway.
It's maybe a good start when you haven't done the traditional [setup.py](https://setup.py) yet. The maintenance of [setup.py](https://setup.py) for existing projects is no hard work.
Positively
Depends on how long you want it running. Look into AWS. They have a free tier for a few months. I don’t know if Twitter has Webhooks, but if it does you can use it to trigger scripts with AWS lambda. Up to 1m calls for free a month... 🤷‍♀️ I used [this](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/dynamic-github-actions-with-aws-lambda/) to do that with github webhooks.
As soon as you can write a script that does something useful, maybe just converting a csv file to a txt, you can put Python experience/knowledge on your resume. You may not be very experience, but even writing one simple script can save a company tons of work hours, and should be recognized. A good way to keep all your projects and scripts together is using a code version control system, like Github. You could make a single repository for all your individual scripts, or save each one as a gist.
I'm working on a text based game, but my spin is that I'm giving the player stats, and enemies. I'm also recording user input so that the AI can predict what you'll do and make the game harder. I also work at a bar near a baseball stadium, so I'm trying to predict which days are gonna have better turnouts. I'm fairly beginner but you have to start somewhere.
I would assume so
Thanks for the pointer to YouTube, I'll take a look.
I work in GIS and i'm hoping that I can automate a few generic tasks like: 1. Get into our SDE and auto-load layers we use daily or on each new project. 2. Create geodatabases with coded domains and what not for projects where doing them manually is time consuming and annoying at best. I'm sure there are far better projects, but at my current employer this seems to be what I can do to help myself and my coworker. I'm finally grasping this stuff, albeit the very very basics of it, so I want to continue learning past the bit of online education by actually doing something with it.
If you've run out of ideas of traits, take a look at the Rust language: it has lots of traits!
This seems like a cool project, i am trying to learn python in my own time, i don't want to copy this but does anyone know of a tutorial to something similar?
That's true about maintaining an existing `setup.py` file. If it ain't broke. Poetry does make it easier to manage package dependencies, too. I'm planning to migrate my existing Python packages to Poetry during each of their next releases partly because of that. I also appreciate the simplicity of a `pyproject.toml` file. I should note that it is possible to have a simple `setup.py` file. [Channels `setup.py` file](https://github.com/django/channels/blob/master/setup.py) is easy to reason about. [Flake8's `setup.py` file](https://gitlab.com/pycqa/flake8/blob/master/setup.py) is a bit more intimidating because of the custom logic it contains.
Hey, I'm happy to help. I found [shields.io](https://shields.io) after I was told I needed a fancier README the first package I published, and those shields add a few pieces of flair.
That blog post is just a link to a YouTube video. What’s the point?
Imporving my simulation of gravity. It is verry slow when simulationg a lot of particles. I think parallel processing is the way to go but I just don't get it yet.
Source or it didn't happen.
It's not about stopping evolution. I have no problem with that. I do have however a bit of a problem if the community tends to promote a feeling of uncertainty. It has already been the case for numpy, numeric, and the other one I never remember. Imagine if we had this level of uncertainty today with numeric libraries. Some APIs, behaviors, and fundamental services need a standard. I see that decent effort is under way, but the climate of "VHS vs BetaMax" that is currently present is not positive for anybody.
That is all great advice! Thank you!
pandas is known to break backward compatibility all the time. Our proficiency as developers is about being fluent in the APIs we use. It's like learning a language. It doesn't do anybody any favour if, say, English were to change all the time in grammar, words, and figure of speech.
Do the weights of the particles add up? Can you end up having a solar system that doesn't collapse?
I had the same question in mind, coming from Ruby, I switched to Python recently. I'm playing now with Flask, etc. But I don't know when I will dare really applying for a position as a Python developer and putting the skill on my resume (especially when most of them where I'm living ask for 2 to 3 years of experience in the language). Anyway, I'm build two projects for my portfolio and I'll see...
Yes, I still need to tweak the way Size gets represented. The second part I dont know. I will have to improve efficiency and find the right parameters to see if I can get a stable solar system
I personally have the opposite reaction. If someone is preemptively slapping my face with a code of conduct I am less willing to work with them. It's like you meet a guy, and he introduces himself and then says "hey it's a pleasure to meet you but if you are a homophobe or nazi you can walk away right now", I don't think I'd appreciate such approach to social interaction, because it means that he preemptively thinks I am.
&gt;at what point is it "ethical" to say you're knowledgeable in python? Ethics has nothing to do with it. You can't pretend to know something you don't know and hope to get away with it. When you think you can get a job that assigns you a python task and gives you a deadline, then you can say you know python.
I mean that's pretty much ethics. The question is when would it be "right" to apply to a job that requires some python knowledge, or at minimum, has it as a admirable skill.
Why a couple hours? Source?
very pretty. is it in 2d or 3d?
Oh, are you specifically talking about stepwise simulations?
Convert them to csv files and use any diff util. Like k3diff for example
2D for now
Looks neat. What do you use for visualising it, Tkinter?
May be it is generating each frame on disk and all those sync() are killing it
oh, no. https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/embedded/vasiliev-python-concurrency-087536.html
I believe he used pyglet based on his other posts
Naive algorithm is O( n^2 ) You have 1000 points. Every point exerts gravity on every other point. To approximate the position of every particle at t+dt, you need to do - n^2 loop (every particle exerting force on every other particle), to calculate the individual forces exerted. - sum up all the forces on each particle. - use equations of motion to calculate the new location and velocity of each particle. Then you need to do the same thing over over the length of the simulation. So if you're generating at 30 frames a second, you gotta do 30 of those n^2 loops for a single second. For a 10 second animation, that's 300 of those n^2 loops. The complex nature of the computation isn't what causes it to be slow. The fact that it "grows" quadratically with the number of particles is what makes it slow. Particles | Number of computations (c is some constant) ---|--- 10 | 100*c 100 | 10,000 * c 1000 | 1,000,000 * c 10000 | 100,000,000 * c Basically, if the OP was to increase the number of particles in his simulation from 1000 to say 100,000, it would take him several years. -- -- Can it be done any faster? Apparently, yes - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-body_simulation#Calculation_optimizations
Git?
&gt; how long would it take to build a couple of command-line exe's to increase the accessibility of the project. I know you mean well, but this is a real classic mistake. Maintaining packages takes a *lot* more time and effort than you think.
I save png's every couple of hundred timesteps and combine them into a GIF in GIMP. Better visualisation is a thing I will work on pretty soon.
Updated to loop, smooth the transitions, and add a second color. These colors are sampled from the classic [Harold Fisk maps](http://www.radicalcartography.net/index.html?fisk) of the Mississipi River.

In terms of gravity size is not the issue, weight is.
On the upside v1 is approximately a month away. Woo.

Unless png's are saved in a separate thread i guess IO slows down the calculation pretty noticeably too.
If I recall correctly, the FTP protocol just does not provide a way to show free space. [There are non-standard extensions, but not all FTP servers nor clients implement them](https://stackoverflow.com/a/56061636/). It seems that `ftplib` won't do that either.
Can you post the code?
I'm not familiar with that term. It's just integration. There's a lot of ways to do that, with some methods having much better accuracy, sometimes with a tradeoff on computation time and sometimes not. When they're not, they're generally harder to code. Just because you have a time step doesn't mean you can't use substepping to improve convergence. A method where you use 3 intermediate steps sounds the same as using 3 extra points per time step, but it's not. You weight the steps differently. Doing methods like an RK4 is exact for up to a 4th order polynomial. That's different than a method where you assume acceleration is constant, which is what V*dt is. If you think about orbits, you actually have sinusoidally varying acceleration. From the Taylor series expansion of sine, you need infinite terms to match a sinusoid. As such, to even approach the quality of the RK4, you need an order of magnitude finer time step. The RK4 isn't exact though for that type of problem.

Finished automating Instagram engagement pods (Telegram ones) with Python. Long story why I ended up doing it, but currently it boosts like amount from 500-800ish to minimum of 1k, usually 2-3k depending on usage amount and on rare occasions when it hits trending it goes over 10k. Yes, it is not the right thing to do and devalues Instagram, but nevertheless, good learning experience. Combines 'off-the-shelf' packages for Instagram boting and Telegram API. You can find it on [GitHub](https://github.com/Ewlbo/Instagagement), has small 'meh' readme, and missing some features.
Looks good! How does poetry handle supporting multiple python versions? Say I want to support &gt;=2.7 and &gt;=3.4?
If you just to just replace the numbers, make a [regular expression](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html) and [replace them](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.sub). &gt;&gt;&gt; line = "Oh man, my Apples: 1234.5678 are almost ripe!" &gt;&gt;&gt; number_re = re.compile("Apples: ([\d]+\.[\d]+)") &gt;&gt;&gt; new_line = re.sub(number_re, "999.999", line) &gt;&gt;&gt; print(new_line) Oh man, my 999.999 are almost ripe!
The path of the large one at the end doesn't seem to be affected enough by the one orbiting it. Are they still being acted upon by particles that are "off-screen"?
You should check if the Shops provides a sitemap. Some shop systems also have RSS feeds
Honestly, for my masters thesis that I applied to and was accepted, I just wrote that in my spare time I like to script with Python and that I could imagine using it during my thesis. I wouldn't say at all that I'm experienced with it, but I can learn fast and I'm sure that it can at least be of help. And they basically accepted me for my Python "knowledge", because they kind of need it for a little side-project. I think it shouldn't be a matter of "is it ethical", it should be a matter of how you can convince them. Obviously, this is nothing in comparison to a real job application, but if at all, they should be ethical to you. Employers have the power (at least in bigger companies), you don't. So they should give you the opportunities rather than the other way around. Good luck!
I hear ya, and a lot of ArcPy stuff I actually shared heavily so it’s potentially a matter of just piecing things together.
Awesome, thank you. I will read this tonight when I get home but the gist I am getting is that it's a multi process solution not an asynchronous one.
The size of the particles appears to be capped at some (arbitrary?) max. Does the "mass" of these particles continue to grow with each collision even after the size hits its max value?
Yes. I didn't think they'd reach those sizes, thats why they stop. But in the calculatioks they get heavier
why would you use REST? go GRAPHQL!
No. It's just verry massive. The size scaling stops at some point
Is there anyway to just use it in a string, so I’m using .replace like this: .replace(“Apples: “ + This is where I to find the numbers, “Apple’s: “ + AppleAmount) Where AppleAmount is a pre defined variable of 183632.32 or something along those lines?
Next step, make them round :)
How are you storing the coords and masses during the simulation? What do you do when 2 merge?
I work with both Python and C# / wpf/UWP. For standalone GUI apps stick with C# . maybe move on from old school winforms to at least WPF.
have you tried connecting the cams to a normal laptop and see what comes up on the UVC app? just to see that there's no physical issue with the cams.
Ahhh, I see. That also explains it's movement when the last two or three objects slam into it without radically altering it's trajectory.
There was an interesting talk about this exact topic at Pycon.de 2017. You can check the video.out [here.](https://youtu.be/E1nx4ReTgps)
Nope, [str.replace()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.replace) does not recognize regular expressions. You'd have to do some crazy splitting and parsing logic, you're better off using `re.sub()`. Now keep in mind you can specify a *count* with `re.sub()`... so you could do an occurrence-by-occurrence find and replace or something like that.
Ok I’ll look into re.sub(), thank you!
I read your comment again. You could do something like this if you know your AppleAmount beforehand: &gt;&gt;&gt; line = "Oh man, my Apples: 1234.5678 are almost ripe!" &gt;&gt;&gt; AppleAmount = 678.90 &gt;&gt;&gt; number_re = re.compile("Apples: ([\d]+\.[\d]+)") &gt;&gt;&gt; new_line = re.sub(number_re, "Apples: {}".format(AppleAmount), line) &gt;&gt;&gt; print(new_line) Oh man, my Apples: 678.9 are almost ripe!
&gt; Can you end up having a solar system that doesn't collapse? Yes, and no. You can have two particles orbit each other forever, or some particle getting slingshotted off at a speed so high that it never falls back into the rest of the masses. However, for that to happen, the particles must have some initial velocity. Consider a universe with 2 particles. They will orbit each other if they have an initial velocity perpendicular to the line connecting the two particles. The larger that initial velocity, the larger the orbiting radius would be. However, since OP is starting off with all masses at rest, the universe is very likely to collapse. Although, it is still totally possible that infinite orbitals or slingshotting happen, because neither of them violate the conservation of energy. Also, since OP has inelastic collisions, his universe is actually losing energy whenever two particles collide and merge, which makes it all the more likely for all the particles to collapse into one massive blob.
If it's pure python, `pypy` will likely make it faster. If you're already using something like `numpy` then it's not likely to see a big speedup.
Needs more dark matter.
Yeah I was just thinking that OP should even go so far as to do the calculation in one script, and then mess around with the viz in a separate script. This assumes OP can handle saving that much data in memory before dumping. I'm not sure how big a sim like this is.
Man I use repl.it and I dont even know how to get a new screen up there
&gt;Can you end up having a solar system that doesn't collapse? You don't get stable orbits outside of [3D space](https://old.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/q8fmo/what_would_orbits_look_like_in_a_2d_universe/). The particles are destined to either go to infinity or collide with another particle.
Consider saving (x,y) data instead of images, that way you can swap out your visualization without recalculating everything.
I don't think that's a restriction of 2d vs 3d spaces. Solar systems are mostly on a plane, as well as galaxies - although there are obviously objects extending from the primary plane, I don't think that's necessary for a solar system to exist in a virtual environment.
I agree with you. 1000 tuples of x value, y value, and mass (I think that's what the thickness repesents) should be very easy to store in ram and then save to disk before loading it into a viz script.
Even more, can we accelerate this with GPU?
I'm all over the place this week. I have too many projects I want to touch on, and I'll end up not making any meaningful progress on any of them, but I need to ride out this distracted phase until I focus again. Reorganizing my twitter bot so in a while I can update it more easily and then I plan to go back to word embeddings experimentation. I'm looking for a way to have an interactive 3D plots: some for protein modeling, modeling for finite element analysis, 3D scatter plots that updates locations and can handle 10k+ points, and if the option is selected I'd like it to connect the points to become a network graph. I'm also working on a web scraper to get NCAA baseball scores before the cws. I'm just not sure how much info I want to scrape, and that's tying me up some.
You can declare [multiple version requirements](https://poetry.eustace.io/docs/versions/#multiple-requirements). Yours might be: ``` python = "~2.7, &gt;=3.4" ``` Take a look Poetry's [version constraints documentation](https://poetry.eustace.io/docs/versions/#version-constraints) for more information.
I think any system with three bodies interacting gravitationally is inherently unstable in the long-term, at least in three dimensions.
What's your diffeq solving algorithm?
Yes. I'm just googling you know. If oracle is putting that forth as a solution, there's probably not a package that does async.
Enjoy your videos /u/dataschool . Your pycon 2019 seminar posted on youtube is excellent. I am just getting started with data analysis and its been extremely helpful.

Why does the center of mass of the system move? Doesn't the system start at rest and have no external forces?
If you're interested in using an approximation, you could try to implement ["Barnes-Hut Simulations'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnes%E2%80%93Hut_simulation). It's a really good way to speed up particle simulations
Source you whore!
&gt; What's with all these code of conducts. Are you all scared that some nazi will join your project? I find it a bit funny to be honest. &gt; It's just that I've seen this pattern more and more often, and I personally find it both funny and a bit unpleasant. Maybe we need a better code of conduct. One with this principle: "You are considered innocent unless proven guilty. Please note we don't want you to feel uncomfortable for no reason."
Github? :D
For fast plotting I would suggest you look at the pyqtgraph library.
That's pretty awesome. Now do the big bang!

I don't think there's anything that's completely automatic. If you want that level of automation, you should probably be using django and django-rest-framework. That being said, there is an integration with flask that automates away a lot of the boilerplate: https://flask-sqlalchemy.palletsprojects.com/en/2.x/
I was wondering the same thing, but notice that a bunch of particles get flung off screen before you get to the part where the remaining system appears to be drifting down and left. It’s still possible the overall COM is stationary if you accounted for all the escaped particles but you’re just looking at what’s left behind.
Would've been shorter if you'd used C++ ;)

I think this is really great @Wolfram. This could be used to calculate initial conditions to create, say, spiral galaxies.
There is a distinct difference between using Python as \*part\* of your job--like I do as a SA, and \*doing\* Python AS your job.
&gt;You can't pretend to know something you don't know and hope to get away with it. Done much interviewing? I mean from the hiring side?
Yeah that's probably the case
I did stuff like this on a 20MHz 386 so it should possible to speed it up. You could calculate the field created by each star, then figure out the affect on each star. Maybe that's the mesh method above? My go-to on the 386 was lookup tables, lookup tables for everything. I recall LUTs for cosine and sine made a huge effect (in speed and .exe size) on stuff I did, maybe you could do the same and/or make one for r^(2)? I also wrote inline assembly and staggered the registers used to account for pipe-lining, but I think that would be tough and/or pointless today... I also recall FPGA boards outperforming entire supercomputers on this task.
You can make it linear by just finding the center of mass, and calculating a single vector for each mass.

Yeah this seems ripe for parralelization
I love seeing you post your progress!! It motivates me to code!
I guess I'm not following why you couldn't just integrate analytically for a 2 body system. Why would acceleration vary sinusoidally? Even if it does vary sinusoidally, what does that preclude you from integrating analytically?
You can. My point was you can dramatically improve the accuracy of the answer, as well as speed up the code with a good integration method. As I said, acceleration isn't constant for an orbit. You're need infinite terms to represent a sinusoid exactly (so not gonna happen), so without a very tiny time step, the error grows rapidly. My point was that even for a better method like RK4, you still don't get good results after a small number of orbits.
Brand new to all of this and taking an intro to data science class. It's really piqued my interest. My assignment this week is to perform a Twitter query and export the results to MongoDB. I figured out the query part but exporting it to MongoDB is slowing me down though. I enjoy the challenge of troubleshooting though and piecing it all together.... the journey is just as rewarding as the destination or something like that?
Each particle interacts why every other particle? There are some tricks physicists use in simulations to improve performance. You can limit it to, say, the nearest 10 neighbours and get a good approximation. Also, as it reaches the end you can ignore the effects of the small particles into the heavier ones.
source?
I.. umm.. what!? That won't work, but I have absolutely no clue why it doesn't. Proof that it doesn't work - consider 4 particles in 2 pairs. (a, b) are close together, (c, d) are close together, but these pairs are separated by an infinite distance. The center of mass is at infinite distance from any of the particles, so each particle should experience no force whatsoever, but that's certainly not the case since (a, b) pull each other and so do (c, d). I only know high school physics, and we were taught that center of mass calculations are correct, so I don't know why that doesn't work here. Can someone explain!?
Hmm, that's a good counterexample.
But why doesn't it work? Please, someone?
Do you have a source? Thanks!
The center of mass idea must be an approximation (I never realized that until now). You can simplify your counterexample to three collinear points (A, B, C). The force on A by B and C is not the same as that from combining B and C to their center of mass.
Another trick is to break it into a grid. Calculate the mass in each grid, then loop: Sum the total of forces on each particle in the current grid like OP is doing now for everything within 1 grid square of the current. Beyond that, assume it’s far enough away and treat each other grid square as a point mass at the center of the that square and use that to propagate the force from all other squares. It reduces the number of calculations by approximately 1 over the average number of masses in each grid. Then you can get fancy with resizing grid squares as things change if you like.
Hum, I've heard about WPF but haven't tried it before. Maybe I should give it a shot. Is it must better than the winforms? Do you think it's better to stick with C# then pyQT? Why&gt;
Oh, I get it. the center of mass needs to be calculated after excluding the current point. To calculate net force on A, compute the center of mass of (B, C), and compute the force b/w A and center of mass of (B, C). Ofcourse, you can't include yourself in the center of mass, because by gravity, you would be exerting an infinite force on yourself (0 distance to yourself) which would make the results meaningless. Unfortunately, to exclude center of mass for each particle is again an O( n^2 ) calculation :( Cool, I learned something today :D
 [QTreeWidget::itemChanged](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtreewidget.html#itemChanged) yes but this would fire for every event. Should I create an if statement to only run when it's the user checkbox action? &amp;#x200B; Ok, I'll check how I can add the attributes. Thank you!
Can you explain this sentence: &gt;no closed-form solutionexists for all sets of initial conditions, and numerical methods are generally required
Ah.. wait, no. That doesn't work either. In my 4 point example, the center of mass even after excluding yourself would remain at infinite distance. wtf?
&gt;Oh, I get it. the center of mass needs to be calculated after excluding the current point. No, that's not enough. I was already assuming we would exclude the current point when I suggested using the center of mass, which by the way can be done in linear time. If you actually do the calculation, you'll find that using the center of mass is just an approximation: 1/x\^2 + 1/y\^2 is not equal to 2(2/(x+y))\^2 in general.
It's the a worse case than the [three body problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-body_problem). It's interesting because only in a universe with three spatial dimensions are stable orbits (think Earth around the Sun in an ellipse) possible.
From your question I feel that you are confusing things. Droplets are mostly for web app deployment. They provide a VM that is running 24h/7d as long as you don't stop it. Think about it as a host for your website. There is no need to use them with jupyter, you don't need a jupyter being open 24h. If you need computational power like multi cpus and gpus you can look into AWS EC2 or GCP. But unless you are doing Deep Learning or some other advanced computations you don't need to use it. Your PC is perfectly fine and free.
Yes, you're correct. Damn, I need to go back and read my high school texts. Thanks :)
Lack of closed form solution is not "instability".
&gt; which by the way can be done in linear time Oh, yes. We can just calculate the overall center and for each point subtract the effect of the current point. Thanks again.
So I think what you are asking is: Where can I run something free in the cloud that has a built in cron scheduler? I'd say your best bet is AWS, Azure, or Google cloud. All three of them offer a free tier and serverless functions (or lambdas as aws calls them). Also, you might look in to heroku. They are slightly easier to deploy, have a free tier, and a cron scheduler that runs every ten minutes: https://elements.heroku.com/addons/scheduler Good luck!
Why?
They don't mean chaotic. They literally mean unstable. Ofcourse, if you use the same formula for Newtonian gravity (inverse square), then stable orbits are definitely possible in 2D. I think what they're referring to is well explained by this - https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/50142/gravity-in-other-than-3-spatial-dimensions-and-stable-orbits &gt; Well, it turns out that in a more accurate description of gravity (in particular, general relativity) the exponent of the power-law ends up being one-less than the dimension of the space. For example, if space were 2-dimensional, then the force would look like 𝐹∝1/𝑑, and there would be no closed orbits.
&gt; It's interesting because only in a universe with three spatial dimensions are stable orbits (think Earth around the Sun in an ellipse) possible. If you continue to use the same formula of inverse square, the orbits will definitely be stable.
Your link directly contradicts his statement: &gt; It's interesting because only in a universe with three spatial dimensions are stable orbits (think Earth around the Sun in an ellipse) possible. Stable orbits are possible for any d&gt;2 provided that the force is gravity-like or spring-like.
This claims that for d&gt;3, it is unstable. https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/q8fmo/what_would_orbits_look_like_in_a_2d_universe/c3vqva1/ &gt; gravity-like or spring-like springs are inherently stable, since their force can be both attractive or repulsive depending on the distance.
&gt; springs are inherently stable, since their force can be both attractive or repulsive depending on the distance. What I meant by spring-like is force linearly proportional to distance, and what I meant by gravity-like is force inverse-quadratically proportional to distance. Your link has nothing to do with either of these cases.
have you tried pyopencl?
Hey OP, If you're looking to optimize your simulation check out the [Barnes-Hut Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnes%E2%80%93Hut_simulation). It uses octrees to run an n-body gravity simulation in O(n log n) time. There is a slight reduction in accuracy, but its pretty negligible (its actually used in computational astrophysics). I did something similar for a physics engine of a game I'm working on. Since your simulation is only 2D you could get away with using [quadtrees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadtree) instead of octrees. Good Luck!
Yeah, for example in the beginning, the top left star and the bottom right star can affect each other by mass, yes, but for a simulation that isn't going for a nobel prize? It's negligible. The 200 or so stars in the top left corner vs 1 star in the bottom right is 99.95% vs 0.5% influence.

You need a queuing system. If you're dealing with massive scale, choose from any of the industry grade "message queuing" systems available. If the data isn't that much, and your average rate of notifications isn't larger than your rate of consumption, you can use a simple [collections.deque](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/collections.html#collections.deque) Let's call the time-taking function that needs to do something with each notification as - `foo` Have two threads. One that receives notifications, and pushes them into the deque. Another that pops out from deque and calls `foo(notification)` Python deques are thread safe, so no worries there. Note that if you're receiving 1 notification per second, but `foo` takes 10 seconds per notification, you essentially have too much data to consume, and your deque will keep getting larger and larger. If `foo` is IO bound (waits for slow db/network/file), then you can just create 10 threads for `foo` and one for receiving the notifications. If `foo` is CPU bound (maxes out CPU usage and does heavy computations), it will be significantly more difficult, because you need to do multi-core processing and not just multithreading, and python isn't the best thing around for multi-core processing.

What’s the sort of part? They didn’t add Python to Windows. They added it to the store. That’s on slashdpt for the bad title.
Taylor series aren't really an approximation. They converge to the function in some neighborhood. The center of mass approximation can be completely wrong.
All that stuff except 'reduce' you mean. https://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=98196
The Taylor series _as a whole_ converges. But you don't have to take the entire series. As with the example regarding the pendulum it provides a reasonable approximation in a limited scope that breaks down completely outside of it.
Fair enough.

if you are trying to make your simulation faster, you should look into running the numerical stuff in C instead of python. my job is to do brain simulations, and this is a thing that i do for performance for my numerical integration. i organize my simulations and handle visualization in python, but C does the heavy lifting. you should look into numpy, which is a python module for numerical arrays. if you are interested in extending your simulations with C, you should look into ctypes, which is the python module to interact with compiled C code. the idea would be to define your state variables in a numpy array. you can get a C pointer for a numpy array which allows you to operate on that array in C. I usually do my whole simulation in C, but i have way fewer state variables than you. you could do your simulations like 100 steps at a time in C and then save an image in python.
If I’m on the hiring committee and see a language on your resume, I expect you to be fluent in it enough for me to ask you to write any/all of the coding exercises in that language.

Do you have the source for your rant simulator? I just wanna learn how to build my own.
Completely disagree: if it’s on your resume I would expect you to be fully productive in that language from the get-go. Just throwing together a simple script in a language isn’t even close to that.
You inspired me to make my own "game engine" using Python and Pygame. I wanted to make a program like this, but after taking physics and seeing this video, I've finally decided to do it! Thanks :)

Working on a weather app that grabs JSON data via API with a small SQLite3 DB of geographic coordinates (130 stadiums). I'm a beginner, but this is a good way to get some practice. Everything has gone really smoothly with the exception of my conundrum of how much data I really want to output. The raw JSON dump is insane with current, minute-by-minute for the next hour, hourly for the next 72-hours, and daily for the next 7-days forecasts including any bit of information one might possibly want (or not want). I'm using Pandas to make the output a bit cleaner. And, I'm not using an IDE currently (just nano on the command line). It keeps me honest!
Great advice!
How has this thread gone on for so long without the source code having been posted? Post the source code, please.

Or Julia, which is syntactically a lot closer to Python.
There is a closed form solution and there are unstable orbits and there are stable orbits. The L4 and L5 points are stable for satellites in the Earth-moon system. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian\_point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_point) &amp;#x200B; The other Lagrange points are conditionally stable. They won't diverge unless there is a perturbation, but what that really means is with very little propellant, you can stay stable. The James Webb telescope is going to be put at L2 for the Earth-Sun system, so it's not all that bad. It will need 2-4 m/s of delta V per year to stay stable out of it's 150 m/s budget. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James\_Webb\_Space\_Telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Webb_Space_Telescope)

This is a topic for r/learnpython. However, take a look at the docs, there is a perfect example of the differences for both to boto3. https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/migrations3.html The first few examples should be of help to convert your snippet. Good luck!
It’s probably easier to use a tree and store intermediate results. The Barnes-Hut algorithm makes use of octrees to do the calculations and can be even faster than the naive gpu approach. You can do a bottom up approach of calculating the gravitational forces since a group of objects will have a single center of mass and a combined total mass to do the calculations with.

What a complete non sequitur.
"No closed-form solution" means there is no formula that you can write using known functions for the positions of the particles which will give the motion for all possible starting positions. E.g., in high school physics you learn that under constant acceleration, the position can be gotten from this formula: x(t) = x0 + v0 t + 1/2 a t^2. That is a closed-form solution to the differential equation x''(t) = a with initial conditions x0 and v0. The differential equation for the n-body problem has solutions, but they look very different depending on n and the initial conditions. There is no closed-form solution. You could perhaps *define* a function as "the solution to the n-body problem under given initial conditions (if a solution exists in this case)" -- and many functions used in physics are in fact defined as solutions to differential equations -- but that doesn't count here. So for the n-body problem (and really most problems where you solve differential equations), you have to approximate the effect of the equation on the initial conditions at discrete steps of time instead of trying to "get the solution" and plug your conditions into that.
What? I'm an aerospace engineer. I know what I'm talking about.
You should look up non sequitur in the dictionary. You keep doing it!
Yes definitely, I know, the requirements aren't the same. :)
I’m part way though Brad Traversy’s django course on Udemy. You build a realtor site. He also uses postgres. It’s kind of tough for a first timer (like me) as it’s a code along of a fairly substantial site. There’s another one on Udemy by Jose Padilla but it uses and older version of django. Otherwise for free you can try the django girls blog site project. Or the django docs. They have a blog site project too (I think).
I have already looked django girls. I felt that they are telling me what to do step by step, but without explaining the steps. Didn't work for me. Django docs had polls app, but I wanted to make something different and complex.
Even though I am a huge fan of Python, the first step of making this simulation faster would be writing it in something faster - like C/C++, Fortran (bleh), Rust, Go or at least Julia (if you want something more pythonic).
You can filter by the `column` argument to get what you want. Also, for the love of god, don't assign random shit to your attributes - it will make your code unreadable. You have MVC tools in the framework, use them.
Hey this is cool, the source?
Another comment mentioned the pixel sized were capped so I don't think the relative sizes are accurate at that stage.
What happened at the end you stupid son of a bitch? You left us in suspense, I need to know what happened to big planet and other big planet before it fell off the edge of your flat world.
Oh yeah polls. I didn’t finish that one. Hmm...well the realtor one isn’t bad. It’s a code along though. He does a good job of explaining. Other than that I’m not much help. :)
Haha. I haven't tracked domain level usage..
The ISP offers the total usage data every month. I just scrape that info off their website and send it to a Google Form and then make this chart..
The ISP offers monthly usage data in bytes. So every month, the total resets and I am able to track how much data used everyday.
Reminded me of this vid by PBS Space time, computing a universe simulation. https://youtu.be/0GLgZvTCbaA

Here's the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/navchandar/Wifi_Usage_Tracker?files=1) It's basically logging in to the ISP website and scrape their site that has my usage. I run this on schedule every day and the data is logged in to a Google Form and then sheets. From there I made this chart.
Here's the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/navchandar/Wifi_Usage_Tracker?files=1) I basically started with Automate the boring stuff with python.
Yeah true.
Switching languages would gain you less performance than writing a better algorithm, and using c instead of a modern programming language comes with its own development time cost. Also, using this kind of performance thinking would mean doing it in Assembler rather than C.
For the past couple of days I’ve been trying to use twitters api to get tweets by date and hashtags/key words. Haven’t succeeded yet, though I don’t think it should be hard. I want to gather data myself and use it to learn some basic NLP
I just checked the scripts. It is in MBs. So the max would be near 300GBs
I am really enjoying seeing you post every so often with new animations. Thanks and keep up the good work. A couple ideas you might consider for future versions: * Periodic boundary conditions - when a particle moves off one edge, it comes back on the opposite edge. For this to work properly, you also want the particle to exhibit gravitational pull on another particle based on the closest version, even if requires looping back. * Random initial velocity (net zero) - Give every particle a random velocity to start. After every particle has a velocity, generate a sum and then add -sum(v) / n to all particles so that the new sum equals zero.
It's cool but maybe post the code to the actual python code you used

Thanks for the share sir!
It would still give you significant increase of performance. Modern compilers can write more efficient assembler code than an average programmer, therefore it's not a good idea to use assembler for this, unless you are a genius. With your kind of thinking we should be using C for string manipulation, Fortran for input/output heavy applications and yes, Python for computationally intensive programs... Every language has a purpose and for every task we should use a language that is most well suited. In this case it's not Python.

Cool. Student of mine did something similar few years ago. Take a look at the video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B52XsO17iGQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B52XsO17iGQ) If you want to optimize the algorithm check out Bernes-Hut algorithm. It will reduce complexity but it can be quite complex to implement.
Here's the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/navchandar/Wifi_Usage_Tracker?files=1)
You see those specs he quoting? 20MHz 386? That's going back a-ways. Bet there weren't many libraries around back then :P Surprised he not suggesting using fixed point math ;P
I love the fact that we live in a time that these kind of simulations are an everyday occurrence. Not too long ago, only supercomputer people laid their eyes on such beauty.
Change language - optimize instructions etc etc. Maybe you get a slight performance increase. Maybe even big 50% (It takes half the time). For me, I like to see improvements of at least an order of magnitude if trying to make something better. At least one order of magnitude (10 times faster.... at least). The real trick there is to find a different algorithm... a different approach. (albeit, changing some bone-head's procedural code into a single monster SQL query did take a job from 90 minutes down to 11 seconds... so ya, sometimes the right tool for the right job is a factor too :)
As a beginner I wanted to write a simple bruteforce program, but when I added multiprocessing I want to cry everytime I touch the code. The pool of workers basically finishes instantaneously and I have no idea what cause the issue. Even StackOverflow did not help me :,D. Guys Help. Please.
Also depending on integration method and timestep used the simulation might not be accurate enough to support long term stable systems. (As well as losing or gaining energy from that inaccuracy)
Something I've been wondering about for ages, is there a module for extra simple C integration around? Like without need to setup a C dev environment? I've lately been using Windows and it's such a huge PITA to set any development for anything up that half the time I don't even bother x.x
I want to learn python (for fun) and I have started working on simple implementation of Infinite monkey theorem (which I have not seen anywhere). [https://github.com/wenta/greenape](https://github.com/wenta/greenape)
Last week I dove into django - I feel like I'm taking information from a firehose (only have a basic knowledge of web dev from past work with API requests) but it has been an absolute blast so far! The larger project I'm working on is machine learning based, but first I need a bunch of labeled image data which I unfortunately have to compile by hand. This might have been a dumb idea, but I thought it'd be cool to build a site to serve myself unlabeled images to classify and save into my training set (and maybe convince friends to help too?). So far I have a base template design with styling, a user authentication/registration system, and working pages for file uploads. It's definitely drawn out the process of the overall project, but I'm not regretting it yet! &amp;#x200B; I'm also pretty sure there are products out there to manage image/data labeling, but I assume use this as a learning opportunity.

Total momentum does not appear to be conserved properly
Unless OP has extensively more frames than they showed in the post, I wouldn't worry about this at all. Images can be written fairly quickly, far faster than standard frame rates for video. OP isn't writing a million images here, they're writing a couple hundred, which you could save in like 2 seconds.
Wolfram?
If you've never done any programming, then I'd recommend starting with basic python first as the other comment says. Its tedious to learn two things to learn at once but if you still insist, I'd prefer you go with `Flask` instead of `Django` as its much easier to learn.
You might be happy with cython
/r/learnpython and read the sidebar Show your code We won't do your homework for you.
ISP specific. Thanks
I'm thinking of two different solutions to keep the overall activities in the center of the frame. \* Track the highest amount of mass and consider that as a defaulted center. ...or... \* Enlarge the window to keep track of ALL masses.
source code, please?
Actually if you *really* cared about making it fast you'd use one of the existing n-body codes that have been optimized to death by the scientific community. Because unless you're prepared to dedicate years of your life to the problem, you won't improve on those. I suspect OP just wanted to play around with a simple model. For this Python is great because it's so easy to get an idea up and running. Your point about language choice is valid though: C is roughly [100x faster](https://benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net/benchmarksgame/performance/nbody.html) than Python for this task. A simulation like this really hits Python at its weakest, performance-wise, since it doesn't reduce to one of the common problem types (linear algebra, sorting, etc.) that can be fed to a library routine.
I have done simulation similar to this (gravity and planets). I did it in Python first because I didn't know any better. Then I tried it in Fortran (because I needed to learn some basics of it for school) and even though I didn't really know much about that language (so the code probably wasn't optimal), it was much much faster. And I'm not talking about 100% increase of speed, I'm talking about 1000% increase of speed, maybe even more. Language is important. You may deny that but there is a reason nothing computationally intensive is written in Python. Python is great for learning, perfect for data analysis, brilliant for data visualisation, pretty good for scripting and many other things. But not for this.
You are absolutely right.
While this is generally true, there is a reason why python is extensively used in science. By using math libraries like numpy and matrix calculations rather than loops you could probably get a similar speed improvement in python for the parts that count. It is a little more complicated to implement it that way, but so is writing it in c.
Python is used in science for data analysis, not for computationally intensive calculations - for these kinds of calculations people use mostly programs in Fortran (scientists change slowly) or C/C++. You could use numpy (or rather should) but it will still be slower than native C. And about matrices... I'm not really sure how do you want to transform this problem so it can be calculated with matrices in a way it's simpler than using C or other compiled language. But if OP wants to play with Python, it's completely fine. He will just have to deal with the fact that no matter what algorithm he uses, it will never be as fast as it could be if he used different language.
I think that just means you were not using the right python tools such as numpy.
Link showing adhoc C matrix computation is faster than numpy, or didn't happen.
Python has compute libs I can bet on to be faster than adhoc Fortran.
That's possible. And Fortran has optimized code that is faster than those Python libraries.
Yeah, that's why every new computationally intensive program is written in Python instead of anything compiled... That makes perfect sense...
numpy and it's cousins, particularly for GPUs were not good?
Python is just a wrapper for c code, so you are writing c when you write python, you just have to know how to do it right and you can get native performance if you use packages with precompiled routines.
Are you able to provide source code? :)
Yes
Wh... What? Python is just wrapper for C? That's not correct at all. You are claiming optimized Python can be as fast as optimized C. Then explain to me why isn't every new computationally intensive program e.g. for quantum physics calculations or molecular simulations or some economical simulations written in Python? It's easier to write and just as fast, if what you claim is right... Except... There are no computationally intensive programs written in Python (that are actually used). Because no matter what, Python will be slower.
I personally write state of the art molecular design software in python and python bindings to c++ code. It is totally possible to get near compiled speeds when you piece together precompiled packages
To all who downvote https://benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net/benchmarksgame/performance/nbody.html Python is 2 orders of magnitude slower in this type of task than fastest (which happens to be Rust And the difference remains with improved algorithms. Whether or not to rewrite depends on use case. For one time animation oython is perfect
So you are using Python even for those computationally heavy parts? If yes, have you tried not using Python for that? And are you sure it's just as fast? I'm sorry but I would very much like to see that...
I've just started myself, and I started at the very beginning and brought myself a Raspberry pi 3b+, shoved it in a Pi-top and away I went. It's got all the software your gonna need plus loads of free PDFs from magpi. Good projects to get stuck into too.
just because for windows only GUIs the .NET stuff is easier and better. QT would be useful if you were looking to deploy a consistent GUI over different devices (windows/linux/max/embedded).
Yes. I work with numpy arrays, and either use them with standard matrix operations or if needed I write precompiled c++/numba code that can do more complicated operations like for looping on the numpy data. It is possible to write near native c++ performance when the routines are precompiled.
This is seriously impressive
[removed]
Interesting. So you are not using some standardized C++ libraries, you are writing your own C++ code? That might work and it's not that far from what I recommended to OP - using different language. But using just numpy won't help that much in this case. You still have to write your own code in C, not just Python.
Pybind11 makes it simple to bind c++ code generally as well as interface with numpy and eigen. I think that I end up getting better performance this way because it kinda keeps you from using any data structure besides arrays, so I always have data locality, which is not always true once you start getting the enormous but “fast” molecular software packages. They always assume the compiler will figure it out, but in reality they are always waiting on data to load into the cache instead of computing because their data is not localized. They make tree like data structures because it’s “smarter”.
Translating a Ising model I did in python to C. Having problems with the random numbers generation :(
If you want to see an example of code that is open source and generally useful to the public, here is the github: GitHub.com/atom-moyer/getpy
Yes, check out [Automate the Boring Stuff](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/chapter13/). This specific chapter shows how to do what you want in the word document section. You just need to put it all together. You can refer to the previous chapters for more general knowledge about python. Particularly the first 10 or so chapters. Essentially your code will look something like this: Read docx file and create Document object Loop through all paragraphs Check each paragraph's text for your keyword (Or list of keywords), copy to a list Output list to a file
What import did you use for that?
Now do the same on a plane that is the surface of a sphere so they won't collapse that much.
This is like the perfect sort of problem for writing in C/C++, it's very self contained and the math is not that complex.
You clearly have never written something in C++ that used to be in python. The performance increase will be *at least* 10x.
Don't use ctypes if you value your sanity. Use pybind11.

Nice！ can you share your github?
&gt; five minutes of googling could show him why they're important to many people, especially those already marginalized from contributing to projects. So you are telling me that people are marginalised in committing to code because they are gay? &gt; He's free to have whatever opinion he wants, but should have no expectation to be taken seriously when he uses mocking language for an issue that many people take seriously. I think you are overreacting and bringing in a topic that is completely unrelated to the issue. We are here to write code. I don't care if you are gay. I don't care if you are a trans. I don't care if your skin is white, black or yellow. All I care is that you write code and we can code together. Why would a gay person feel marginalised online, where your identity can be as secret as you want it to be? Are we being PC for the sake of being PC at all costs, even when it makes no sense because it's not relevant?
I will need to optimize my code for that. It gets quadraticly more hard for my PC for each new particle.
Switching languages doesn't solve the core problem of using a bad algorithm in the first place, it moves the problem to a different platform and adds dependencies. You could switch language and use a more optimal algorithm, in which case we should argue for optimizing EVERYTHING by using a 3rd party solution altogether, or even just some software previously written. And then the whole thought process and problem that the op was solving is likely discarded, as the original problem he was solving was likely: "I wanna do something cool while learning python".
You don’t need to switch language. Checkout Cython, https://cython.org
Maybe we just need to chill out with this PC at all costs. If someone is a racist bigot, you can slap him in the face with a CoC. Until then, I don't feel it's a pleasant interaction to think that as soon as I step into a new club I have to be considered first and foremost a potential threat to the social stability of the club.
You defined a variable pin. You defined a function with pin attribute. Where did you call the function?
The moment I read that it clicked, I removed the variable and added; print(validate\_pin(input("Enter a number: "))) and it worked.
Yeah. Decent subreddits are suppose to purge this abysmal garbage
I am absolutly ok with you on the main point but just for saying: it is not a BAD algorithm, it is the most exact one, so it has a bad complexity. All other algorithm work by using approximations so you deal speed against precision.
Some of those Python libraries \*are\* the optimized Fortran libs.
I assume that time complexity is O(n^2)? Have you considered using some heuristic to filter out forces under a certain threshold? Also: Does the implementation use numpy or Numba?
super opiniated and no arguments... I quite sure someone could say exactly the inverse with the same conviction. Would you consider giving us some reasons ?
Not necessarily. I do electromagnetics calculations that are very, very reminiscent of n-body problems, and we use incredibly sophisticated math to drive the calculations down from O(n^(2)) to O(n ln n). The thing about the approximations that do that is that the error is fully controlled, meaning you can choose an approximation error _below the numerical precision of the machine you're working on_. Essentially you get the speedup (or at least scaling behavior) for free.
N-body/potential-evaluation problems are straight linear algebra.
Looks awesome!
The validate\_pin() function is defined but never called.
Can you do one where large masses shoot off smaller masses upon collision?
https://docs.python-guide.org/
To me exact indeed mean that you control the error and can make it arbitrarily low. I work on an electronic density computation code, so it is a kind of n-body problem with electrons and quantum mechanics, and the main approach is a big approximation in a early stage of the theory that is then gradually fixed with refinement. Even if this is not the approach used in your case, it is likely that the improvements are really specific to the physics of your problem and use symmetries and other physical properties that does not exist in the n-body gravitational problem. In fact there are solutions that may improve the scaling with the cost of different approximations that can be controlled: - compute the total potential field on a given grid (the size of the grid is the convergence parameter) and then compute the forces for each particle (O(n/d^2) with d the size of the grid) - use some kind of Monte-Carlo methods. It is a lot heavier in computation but you can virtually parallelize infinitely, with few communications. However, the formulation may be quite hard to obtain, and probably require good math and physics understanding - Probably a lot of other methods, it is an old problem, there are loads of scientific papers But I think if you use only one CPU the naive O(n^2) algorithm is still the best in term of resolution*precision/cost because there is no initial cost and no intrinsic limitation to the precision that need additional steps to be controlled.
For reduce testing time you just need to reduce the number of particles to a few. Instead of fully switching language, numba must be perfect to have c speed
Thats cool! Good work. Willing to share source code?
You can get dramatic improvements by using cython or multiprocessing. As important as algorithmic efficiency is, its a bit silly to not take full advantage of hardware, and the skills you develop in the hardware approach are more portable.
Seasonally
 Unless I mistake center of mass approximation of the field of gravity of a distribution of mass only stand for a sphere (more precisely spheric symetry) when you are outside of the sphere (if you are inside of a sphere with a spheric hole with same center, all forces compensate so the resulting gravity field is of zero)
Thank you for your answer. :)
then threads won't help you. Try multiprocessing.
If you aren't developing websites, you don't need a VPS like Digital Ocean. If you want to develop websites, you'll want to deploy on a server of some kind, and Digital Ocean rents a decent VPS. You can develop web apps on your local computer, but when you want to go 'live' you still need to test on a remote server so you can debug ports forwarding, DNS assignment, and server configs. Instead of renting a VPS, I recommend buying a Raspberry Pi and setting up your server there. For a nominal fee, you can buy a domain name from Google and update the name address resolution whenever you are testing.

That’s my goal is to automate small things. I may go deeper in the end, but that’s my current goal.
Now do it in 3D xD
Correct. It's a local ISP available in my area.
Recommendation: play around with the exponent of the gravity. Set 1 / r^x where x is anything you want. Especially fun if you do it real time, and switch between positive and negative exponents.
Thank you for the explanation. Now it makes sense.
GitHub?
Maybe because the simulation combines particles without accounting for the conserved momentum from those collisions
Also to add, If your computer can take it then implementing some conservation of momentum with the collisions of particles would be interesting
Hey, this was a project where I used neuroevolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroevolution) to create small neural networks that learn to approximate classic logic gates like NAND, OR, AND, etc. The components are added in a classic evolutionary algorithm way, but the built networks are then trained via gradient descent. Later, finished logic gates can be inserted into other NN's as discrete modules, to try and build more complicated structures!
Awesome, thank you!

There was actually a discussion about matrix computation in different languages on /r/programming earlier this week. NumPy was about half the speed of hand-optimised matrix computation in C, but it was about the same speed as standard C, and a lot faster than other implementations. https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/bsuurg/making_the_obvious_code_fast/eoseft9/
Do you know why the center of mass of your system moves? If your initial conditions have a truly random distribution I would expect a minimal drift. Alternatively you could compute a delta at every frame and re center the frame so that the center of mass remains in the middle.

The easiest way to speed up these kind of simple simulations is to use numba to compile slow functions to fast. Tldr: import numba and add the @njit decorator before slow functions
#Viewing Properties To view the properties of an argument, use the dir() function. I usually set the debugger to pause at that part of the code, then type dir(object) into the shell. # Setting Types The input arguments to a function are dynamically typed, so my `add()` function can add both integers and strings. If you want to set a static type, there is a syntax for that. `def function(arg1:str, arg2:class) -&gt; str` The `-&gt;` at the end sets the return type.
I laughed (☞ﾟヮﾟ)☞
Automate the boring stuff with python is fun.
Python is overkill unless you need to do this often. Like another user said, use excel to export the files to .csv, then use a diff program to find the differences. I use `sdiff -s`, but everyone has a favorite.
Did you just confine everything to a plane (with zero initial velocity relative to the plane and nothing to cause acceleration out of the plane) and use 1/r^2 gravitational force like in 3d? Or did you do it [accounting for 2-d gravitational force should be a 1/r force](https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/78975/newtonian-gravity-equation-in-a-2-dimensional-world)?
This functionality isn't built into ftp in general. I recommend telling the server to write a file to the ftp folder which has information about hard drive space and who is using it.

what does initial rest have to do with orbiting? particles start to move instantly and apart from 2 particles simulation where particles crash into each other, there would be very likely some orbiting...the reason why most simulations dont have stable orbits is invalid calculations or rounding
Thanks! :D
Fluent Python
I have a similar thing running in Processing and it runs in real time for 1000 particles easily. Something isn't right.
is it easy to get numba working? when i first tried it out, i had to build llvm from source. also if i recall, you had to know which operations numba was good at accelerating.
so i'm looking at the pybind11 github page, and it looks like it is for C++ rather than C. so it isn't a replacement if you are working with code already written in C.
cool. if you aren't interested in trying out C at this stage, i would still highly recommend checking out numpy.
you should investigate what is scipy doing for integrators. they might have something built on top of C or fortran now.
I would say.if you can do this your not a beginner and c or a low level language wouldn't be that difficult to learn for you
Out of curiosity why do you want to learn Django specifically? Reading your comment it seems you are looking to get more familiar with coding concepts as opposed to delivering an web based project. If that is the case Django will be extremely frustrating for you as it is a (relatively) sophisticated web framework written in python. Start with basic python concepts in Google Collaboratory.

Coming from the C++ world, and having loved the "Effective C++" series by Scott Meyers, I cannot prevent myself from recommending "Effective Python" (by Brett Slatkin). It is always there on my desk :)
I am using numpy already
Because squares are easier then circles xD

What did you build it with? Tkinter?
Fluent Python is the book that really took my python coding from "good" to "great" a few years ago, and I highly recommend it as well. It covers a lot of stuff that you will find useful everyday as well as things that you may never use but are good to know about and understand (such as protocols and metaclasses.) While you can do a front to back read through, it's not necessary to go in any order. It has enough content it's basically like a bible, read the sections that you find interesting or need to know more about.

Self learning data analysis with Pandas. Tornado data specifically. https://www.linuxnorth.org/pandas/
Fluent Python, or pick a O'Reilly book about a project that you're interested in (Web Scraping, Natural Language Processing, etc.) and do that.
Cool. Someday, if you're really feeling masochistic, look for python bindings to NVIDIA CUDA processing. You can use a video card to chew through applications like this at stupid fast speeds. Fair warning though, it isn't easy, and there is a lot of room for optimization that depends on understanding the video card architecture.
This is awesome, nicely done! I wrote a similar gravity sim in Python myself ages ago, and improved performance in later revisions tremendously using a [Barnes-Hut simulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnes%E2%80%93Hut_simulation). Definitely dig around for technical discussion around it, but the gist is that you can mitigate the O(N^2) problem by grouping nearby particles into a single logical particle for the purpose of determining gravity force on other particles which are far away. For example, you have particle A off somewhere, and then particles B, C, D elsewhere. B, C, D are "close" to each other, so you can calculate their center of mass position and combined mass, and use that to determine their cumulative force of gravity on particle A, rather than individually doing calculations with particles B, C, D against A. Other feature ideas if you want to keep playing with this: - Starting point save mechanism: if you have a starting arrangement of particles that yields an interesting result (stable-ish orbits or whatever), press a hotkey to save some representation of the initial set of particles' starting positions and mass to disk, so you can read from that file and replay the scenario later - a "camera" mechanism to follow the center of mass, so you can continue to watch a set of bodies that are orbiting each other even after they would have moved off-screen - a flag to enable/disable combining particles when they collide. This, in combination with randomly assigning colors to each particle, leading to a sort of "swarm" effect which makes an interesting screensaver.
Basically you are driving the rest of the system with an external force, opposite to what pull the disappeared particle was exerting on the system. So it's not a closed system and many of the conservation principles are not applicable.
Which library did you use for graphics?
If the particles are spread radially from the center of mass, and have 0 rest velocity, they will always move to the center and merge. It is a simple invariant. If all initial forces point to the center of mass, all particles move to the center of mass, and the center remains stable.
PIL. I used the position of particles and made a 2D array with them, then saved it
But why
I like to think of it as follows: In the beginning momentum is 0, but when a particle gets slingshot out of the field, then it will leave the rest of the system with some momentum != 0
I know, when it's your job, you may distract yourself with other things than coding in the subway. But when you're a passionate developer or an amator you can enjoy programming in python on your go.
Well, looks like I've got tonnes to learn
I don't know man. Isn't this numpy territory? Why not use a proper library? Nobody uses python for plain python but for their libraries. Wouldn't this make python end up close to c++?
Fair point, personally I'd rather use my laptop/hotspot if coding on the subway.
Gooduck with that!

Yeah I want to play with it too!
I don't know what's out there anymore, but a few years ago I automated a document using https://python-docx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ It worked well for my particular use case.
Is Cython fully compatible with standard Python?
Oh no I don't particularly need anything fancy like that, just ideally would like to be able to simply edit C code as a part of the Python project, and have it compiled for me when I launch the program/script.
I discovered [Makie](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Makie.jl) today when [Chris Rackauckas](http://chrisrackauckas.com/) posted it [in this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Julia/comments/bu7lkm/where_can_i_find_some_cool_visualizations_done/) on r/Julia. Makie does "high level plotting on the GPU."
what did u use for drawing ? i never met library that does not have circle drawing function
I concede this article is great. F# SIMD looks beautiful!
ye but unless they hit each other they can still find some low scale orbits ...i understand that it is less likely but with 100 particles it would happen ...maybe in real life we would have some rocks orbiting each other but it happens...what prevents simulations from achieving this is mostly errors in computation ...that is what im trying to say, i find it really obvious fact that it is less likely for stuff to orbit if it aims to hit itself in the center
1: use the search function 2: /r/learnpython 3: read the sidebar
Thanks
It's...its own thing, a python-like language that you can embed in python and that compiles to C. Basically it's a way to speed up certain parts of your program by lowering them to C without having to define a C extension module.
&gt; You can have two particles orbit each other forever, or some particle getting slingshotted off at a speed so high that it never falls back into the rest of the masses. forever? wouldn’t they gravitate into each other given infinite time?

I'm sorry, why did it take a couple of hours to process? Could you share your code? There has to be some improvement to be made. I did the same thing almost 2 decades ago on a 75MHz CPU and it worked at minimum 1 FPS (got fast with fewer particles). Not on Python, but still. I'll be glad to give you any hints on how to make it faster and to explain why.
This sounds like you looking for help with your coursework. Here are some hints. * work out how to do the unpack manually * think about how to automate your manual steps and then search to find out how to do in Python * work out how to detect that you have unpacked the last file

Of the two main modules mentioned, I previously used one (imp) for a few of my toy projects, and also for a more serious one. It was reasonably easy to use to do what I wanted to. However, it was bugging that it was deprecated and the recommendation was to use importlib instead ... but I couldn't figure out how to do it. I mentioned that on my blog, asking if anyone could give me some pointers, without anyone rising to the challenge. It was only after I asked a question on stackoverflow that I got the information I needed [1]. This suggests to me that either I do not know how to read and understand the documentation or that at least some additional examples for using importlib to replace all the functionalities of imp are needed before it could be considered for removal. https://stackoverflow.com/a/43573798/558799
Thank you.
Thanks but now it's showing 50 and that is the x at start. How do I update it
In the second code `make_widget` where `some_entry` is assigned is called from `startPage.__init__` thus `some_entry` exists when `print_it` is called. In the first code `make_widget` is only called when the button is pressed thus `entry1` does not exist before that and the error occurs if `print_it` is called before `make_widget` is.
Well, reason is: I: My code is probably as inefficient as it could be II: I have no idea what I'm doing III: Please help. https://github.com/Mittwochmensch/Gravity/blob/master/Gravity_simulation.ipynb I'm already looking into multiprocessing to speed things up but that stuff is so confusing

Can you give an example scenario? Im still new to programming too but I have made tools and scripts to make my life easier. Say I have a program that opens a 400MB CSV and analyses it seven different ways looking for various details and then spitting out a report. I have already optimized the code by utilizing proper data types, i.e. Dicts vs lists, but I am wondering if I can speed up the procedure even more if I use Cython. I use the CSV library and I arbitrarily define values I am looking for through a combination of RegEx and string literals. It takes up to several minutes for computation to complete and it used to take 30 minutes. Is this an opportunity to utilize Cython?
I use properties as my pointers. A good idea for actual pointers in Python would be use the @ symbol in front of variables names. Ex: a = 1 b = @a
Correct, but you can minimize C, so even in a naive algorithm like this, the difference can be 100-fold. For example, given that x, y are distances on 2 axes between 2 given objects, attraction force is basically r^2 * m. r = (x^2 + y^2)^0.5. A common mistake is to compute them separately which means an extra square root operation. Another one is to just compute this sum then normalize it or somehow transform it into vector components. Instead, simply doing F = (x^2 * m, y^2 * m) should suffice. Then, since the force is reciprocal, you can re-use this value to apply the same amount for both objects. In fact, exclude m initially, and only multiply it, for each object, to the mass of the opposite object. This last trick will halve execution time. Not doing extra math will reduce it further. And in Python you can vectorize the whole thing, making it even faster. The whole thing shouldn't take more than 1 second per frame at its most, unless performed on a Raspberry Pi or something. And that's before even optimizing it with islands or trees.
If the conditions are perfect they can orbit each other forever. It's not impossible just incredibly rare.
Well, thats the thing. I just save the particle position to an numpy array and then print it. And the simplest way of indicating Size I thought was to just draw a box. Here is a github link: https://github.com/Mittwochmensch/Gravity/blob/master/Gravity_simulation.ipynb

Been a while since I used pygame but you could try putting the text = myfont.render(tx, True, red) line into the while run: loop.
Thanks. That looks interesting. I’m really surprised this isn’t something that flask would do. I know i can do it with Spring Boot, which is why i thought i was just overlooking it.
As a roll-your-own solution, you could use the Python logging module to a common file, that you then parse with another script. I'd think you're going to have to update what you output no matter what, however.
It should be a .py file not a batch file. If it happened to be a py file and its closing really fast its because the script finished running. Import the time module and add time.sleep(10) to the end of your script to see if its working. If no error appears you're fine. Also to run any script from CMD, navigate to the directory and type python nameOfFile.py and press enter.
now it makes sense, but more importantly this will also mean that i wont be able to use this method to get the values of the entry field into anther class. :( Can you suggest any method for doing so...?
Yes. I figure this out but thanks for helping me
So first thing's first: You're losing a lot of performance by just using OOP. You have very little data about any particle, and every particle has that data. PosX, PosY, Vx, Vy, M, D. 6 in total. You can represent that as 6 long arrays, which means you'll actually write shorter code for the whole thing. When you update the acceleration for particle P1, because of the influence of particle P2, you can already also update particle P2 because every action has an equal and opposite reaction. Don't compute the same thing twice. Same thing for collision detection. I'm not going to repeat my previous answer to the guy that explained that this is O(n**2). I made the same points there, look it up. Further hacks: computing the distance is expensive. And you're doing it 2000000 times every round (once for collision detection, another time for updating the force). Instead, you don't need the position (which is the square root of the sum of the squares of its components), but the square of the position, which is much cheaper to compute, and you can compare it to the square of the minimum distance. If a&lt;b and both are positive, then a**2 &lt; b**2. The idea is to KISS. Keep it simple. Simple is good. You created classes, compartmentalized functionality, made redundant computations as a result because the results became inaccessible. The best simple thing is to write this as a single piece of code, have a single nested loop that looks at every pair only once, and computes the interactions with as little redundancy as possible. Then try to tidy up the code if it doesn't lead to performance degradation. And you're also generating png images :). That's expensive. I didn't know how you rendered it. I thought you used something like cocos2d. But a thing you can do even now to make it faster, is to do a @numba.jit on the functions that compute acceleration and collision. Maybe `@numba.jit(nopython=True, cache=True)` if you don't use any Python data structures and stick to numpy. It's an easy stupid way to make things faster. I'll try to get you an optimized example to show you what I mean
I agree with you, it's difficult and really slow to code on mobile especially with keyboard autocorection. Also we can't compare a laptop IDE with a mobile one. Currently I'm looking for solution like code server (VScode on web page) or jupyter server.
The author is awesome and worth following
I found the part on "simulating pointers" to be utterly bizarre, not so much in concept but in the concrete approach. I know I've seen "pointer" classes for Python on the interwebs before. At a minimum, it just needs an attribute called "value" or something. Instantiate the pointer object, and initialize the value. Now you can pass around the "pointer", change the value from inside a function, swap the values of function parameters, and whatever other C-isms you so desire. This doesn't really do anything that a list with one element can't, but at least it's obvious in its intent. Returning to the approach in the article, the example of "keeping track of every time an interesting event happened" does not in any way necessitate the use of pointers, in C, C++, or Python. You just need a record or class (or maybe a table or dictionary). In C you might use a pointer to avoid pass-by-value in function arguments, but in C++ and Python that's simply not relevant. Second, what's the point of packing a predefined dictionary into a class and then using properties for access when objects **are** dictionaries already? Just make an attribute, wrapped in a property or not. The extra dictionary does nothing. Third, under the assumption that we are "simulating a pointer", there is no purpose in arbitrary putting methods on said class. As written, this is just an ordinary class with superfluous internals. I'm not a pro though. Someone who is, please tell me whether I'm missing something here. Last, a more basic criticism. Although the factual content of the article seems to be basically accurate, on the whole it's incoherent. The useful parts have nothing to do with pointers, the pointer parts have nothing to Python, and the parts about "doing pointers in Python" are misleading and useless. At the same time, the real question -- under what circumstances would you ever want to simulate a pointer in Python -- is not addressed.

Umm.. you do realize that with the initial conditions I mentioned, it is mathematics that makes any other result impossible. Let us simplify it. Consider just 2 particles, initially at rest. After some time, they will collide. There's no escape. They will move in a straight line towards each other.

Questions on how to use a framework would probably be better answered in a "help" subreddit. That said... I'm familiar with web2py. The code you posted is a bit confusing to me, but I'll see if I can help. **Questions** What does *Ship()* return? Is it a dal.Row, the integer representing the *id* of the row in the database, a dict, or something else? In the first *if* block, you're first storing whatever *Ship()* returns, and then overwriting it with an integer (the *id* of the row you create with the *insert()* statement [cited](http://web2py.com/books/default/chapter/29/06/the-database-abstraction-layer#insert)). Is there a particular reason for this? **Attempt At Support** If you're trying to select() ships out of the table and put them in *myShips*, up to a count of *numberOfShips*, then try the builtin *dal.Rows.as_list()* [cited](http://web2py.com/books/default/chapter/29/06/the-database-abstraction-layer#as_dict-and-as_list): if counter != 0: myShips = db.playerShipData.select(limitby=(0, numberOfShips)).as_list() However, this is going to give you a list of dictionaries that represent the database entries. This is different from the way myShips is being populated when counter==0, which causes myShips to be a list of integers.
I thought so at first too, but once I got the hang of "Grokking" things I discovered a dozen other things ELK is good for. Now I use it in some manner in most of my projects.
The game is called Tower of Hanoi. You're absolutely right, it's not a difficult game when you have very few "blocks" (I have three in my example) and there are actually algorithms created to solve the game. The objective is to create the original tower from the left stack on either the middle or the right one by moving the blocks. However, you can't place any larger block on top of a smaller block, so you have to be clever with your block placements. It will become more difficult the more blocks you add and it will also double the minimal time needed to solve it for every single block added. Needless to say it will get really difficult really quickly.
Functions don't have a concept of state (or, at least usually, they shouldn't have). Classes do. This means that you can store variables in a class, so that you can retrieve and manipulate them.
Oh, I see where the challenge lies now. Keep us updated with the further levels. :)
You are actually able to select the number of blocks you want to pick (from 1 to 10) at the beginning of the game. I just picked 3 because it doesn't take long to solve and doesn't look crappy in the video. Thank you for the interest 😄
Add music to it, pimp up the design, turn it into a mobile game, make money! :)
Haha I don't want to make money, it's just for fun and it's a fairly simple game. That's why I published it and everyone can use and sell it if they want to. I will keep you ideas in mind, thank you for the feedback👍
it's not that rare at all, especially not incredibly so, as that would make the planet we live on incredible. &amp;#x200B; any two particle interaction that doesn't sling off to infinity creates a stable orbit, this should become obvious if you imagine the planets to have no diameter. however some of these orbits get closer than the radius of the planets, so they crash into each other, this doesn't make them unstable. for a planet's orbit to start spiraling into the center something needs to slow down it's orbital velocity. Imagine space debris acting like a sort of air resistance, so as it slows down it goes into the center.
Cool thanks, i never used windows for programming.
When it creates better abstraction. Some time ago I developed a python library for simulating an interacting set of bacteria. The problem therefore contained a natural unit, the bacteria. Each bacteria has certain properties, say like their genetic code, the composition of internal molecules and so on. Furthermore, the bacteria had functions or abilities, like splitting, eating, attacking a neighbour etc. By making a Bacteria class, and to this class adding a set of properties (basically float, integer and string variables in the initialization) and a bunch of abilities or methods (basically “public” class methods (yes, they are all formally public in python)), I had created a useful abstraction of the system my library was representing. Furthermore, I had to define a cell, beaker or other container in which the bacteria existed. That unit itself was neatly abstracted by containing certain properties, like size, geometry, as well as a collection of instances of the Bacteria class, plus a few methods. Although one can create this without classes, the ability to group properties and methods that corresponds well with the system I model in code, the abstraction becomes very nice and that way as I continue to expand the library, things are just easier and more intuitive. For example, some of the methods of the bacteria proved to have a great deal in common, and therefore it made sense to abstract that and make a general class of BacteriaOrgan that then was the template of a specific type of ability of the bacteria. The appropriate abstraction of the problem is a major key to building scalable and sustainable software, and classes are great for that.
Well, here's the thing. There are around 99 gazillion mah-jong games for mobile. But I found one that is really nice, has all kinds of scores, rewards throughout many boards, etc, and a really nice melody (looped but not boring) with a very attractive design, and I paid every extra I could get for that game. Forgive my way of putting this but most games have a design like yours, which is bad. If you can make a cool design for it, something that resembles the game's historical background and whatnot (I couldn't find an example suddenly in google because apparently there is also a tower in a city called Hanoi and I get a ton of pics from that :D) then you're already 100 steps ahead of others. Youtube has a ton of royalty free music, you might find something among them that matches the design style. If not, [audiojungle.net](https://audiojungle.net) offers music for small prices (although I'm not sure about their licenses). Once you've published the game you have nothing to do with it if you don't want to get into it deeper. Still, it's a chance to make something out of it, plus a learning experience for turning Python code into mobile app and publishing it on the app stores. I'm not much for game design but if I'd have all the mechanics done with a basic design, I wouldn't miss the rest of the journey.
Nice work! You will never forget your first one. :)
Classes are used in situations where it is important to preserve state in memory, and furthermore where the code consuming the class has no knowledge of the object's internal state. It allows for a useful separation of concerns in complex situations. I know that's vague, so lets look at an example. Lets say we have a program called eat_a_meal. It has a bunch of food dishes and a bunch of hungry people as a starting state. It has multiple functions for what the people can do like, 'nibble_at, chow_down_on, and sniff_and_put_back. These functions change the state of the people. They go from more hungry to more full, and what they currently are craving changes. There are multiple functions that run on each food dish, like take a big scoop, take a small scoop, put some back, etc. These change the state of the dishes. They go from having a large quantity to a small quantity, and from looking appealing to looking less appealing. The key here is the functions representing the high level actions that involve both a food and a person. ex nibble_at(person1, food1) If those functions are passed objects, they can call the corresponding method functions on each object, make sure that the response is adequate, and then move on. They don't need any more knowledge about the internal state of the objects than that. If you don't use objects, then you are going to have to pass around some representation of the state to all these functions. On a large project, you might have people start to modify the state directly in these high level functions and not use the lower level dish or person specific functions. It's also just another set of variables that need to be accounted for, passed around, etc. As a project gets bigger, and gains more contributors, the number of these data stores that need to be passed around grows. Some of the might be poorly understood by some of the other contributors. They might modify them in ways that were not intended, that cause breakages somewhere else. Objects(and classes) prevent this from happening.

This puzzle always gives me flashbacks to my time in CS. One of our projects was to build a Towers of Hanoi solver using assembly language using recursion. I got it to work, but still don't remember how or why it worked.

&gt;For many Python users (myself included), this is a completely foreign syntax that changes how easy it was to previously read Python code Bullshit! This walrus operator nonsense is absolutely ridiculous. It is *not* mandatory, it is *not* hard to understand, and it was *not hard to implement*. If you don't like it then there's absolutely *nothing* preventing you from... not using it! Grow the fuck up. I use Twisted every single day, our entire application suite/ecosystem is built on top of it. We finished moving to Python3 last spring. And unless you're using some of the more sneaky/hidden functionality then there's nothing missing in Twisted for Python3 that is preventing you from upgrading! It's on *you* at this point, not on Amber or Guido or anyone else. &gt;new developers have been flocking to it, and adopting it for use in building large production systems that might have been better off written in different languages that are much less suited to exploring but more suited to long-term, stable systems. This is a failure of the developers and the system engineers to know what the fuck they're doing.
I just recently figured out a beginner-friendly answer for this, so I’ll share. When you start passing the same data and/or variables to/from the same set of functions, it makes it much simpler to create a class for that data and those functions. This allows you to encapsulate it all in one object and avoids the cumbersome passing of data around. You don’t HAVE to use classes, just like you don’t HAVE to use functions. It just makes it easier and simpler in that use case. I’m sharing this because when I was searching for an answer to this exact question, I kept getting the same answers about using classes to model a physical object, which I was never trying to do. So I felt their answers meant that I didn’t ever need classes. It was only when I was using functions heavily and realized that I was awkwardly passing data around to the same set of functions over and over that I realized that this could be MUCH more easily handled in a class.

I don't know if that will work particularly well. Software with keys is pretty easy to crack. Especially python, where the code isn't even compiled. Plus, creating a GUI and an executable is system dependent. You'd need to compile versions for a bunch of different systems and make sure the user downloads the right one. All and all it sound hard. An easier idea might be to run the script somewhere in the cloud, and have users access it through a website. That way you are controlling when &amp; where it runs, and they just pass their info to the script through the website. That's generally the model used these days by most people trying to monetize a script.
By state you mean in reference to what the function/class is acting on? So a class method can intrinsically apply to its state but you would have to redefine a variable to change it with a function?
Interesting stuff! I'm a bioscience engineer who got into machine learning, so here's my view of your point regarding the apparent inability of this evolutionary strategy to wire up blocks into more complex assemblies. One aspect of evolution that's often used as an argument against it by the intelligent design crowd, is that there's no useful intermediate stages, of e.g. an eye. They then say that this is proof of an intelligent designer. However, there are many intermediate stages that are useful to an organism. What starts out as a light sensitive protein can over thousands of generations evolve into full fledged eyes. What seems to be a problem here is the lack of functional-but-suboptimal assemblies of 'atoms' that it can iterate upon: i.e., there's only one (or a small fraction of the search space) way to wire up the atoms into a functional assembly.
I didn't realize turtle could do this!
It is rarely necessary to code anything in C. Using numpy arrays an operations on the entire array often gives as much speed-up (or more if you are not good at optimizing c code). Edit: replied to wrong comment!
I don't know if it would be popular, but one of the most useful skills for any programmer is the ability to be thrown into a terrible code base and figure out how to make sense of it and hopefully fix it. You could potentially have some sort of channel where people submit terrible code (you should probably limit it to code that is actually in production somewhere) and you try and make sense of it and then fix it. That being said, i would never do this myself. It sounds horrible. But i would definitely watch someone else.
here is the popup: [https://imgur.com/a/2vzcGjS](https://imgur.com/a/2vzcGjS)
Are you using numpy arrays and operations on the entire array? Also, a good algorithm for integrating Newton’s second law allows for a larger timestep, although gravitation could be a bit ill-conditioned. Velocity Verlet is good since it preserves the energy over long time, unlike many other algorithms tha systematically over- or underestimate the energy, leading to a two-particle system slowly spiralling inwards or outward.
Vispy is the closest to what you want probably, if you care about plotting on the GPU. It has a mostly functional matplotlib backend too.
With modern floating point cpus, lookup tables typically give a slowdown.

Numpy arrays in python usually gives a performance within a few percent og a good c implementations (except for problems when it doesn’t :-)
Feel free to! I didn't open-source it for nothing😉. You can message me at any time with any question.
Very insightful, thanks! So it makes sense to use classes when you have multiple large objects that share a similar set of parameters. It seems like an enhanced dictionary, almost.
Hey, Maybe this is what you are looking for? [In Selenium, how to log in website on the popup window with python?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44993540/in-selenium-how-to-log-in-website-on-the-popup-window-with-python)
Ah thanks this explains the concept of state! So classes are generally not only more organized, they can help track and protect the state better, if I understand correctly.
They gave you the source code. Knock yourself out!
Now you can get a job at Bioware!
Recursive depth first search, most probably.
Yes, I believe so. In stateless execution, the output only depends on the input. In stateful, the output depends on the state of the object. My zen is to always prefer functions unless it’s very inconvenient or impossible.
Sorry, I was wrong. The actual difference is that in the second code the assignment is to \`self.some\_entry\` which is a field in self, while in the first one the assignment is just to \`entry1\` which is a local variable. make that \`self.entry1\` and you're good.

Yes, mostly. They are a way of separating state into domain specific "boxes", and limiting the way that the data in each "box" can be modified.
I'm not going to sell someone else's work as my own, I gave my opinion on the subject, he can do whatever he wants.
it doesn't work either way. in the book It said I need batch file to open the program directly from run so that's why I used batch file. I tried opening with cmd like you said and it gives me error: python: can't open file 'r': \[Errno 2\] No such file or directory 'r' is in the name of the .py file im trying to open. also is .py file supposed to be just a text file? it has notepad icon and I can open it like any other text file.
&gt; It is not mandatory. The author didn't say that is is. &gt; it is not hard to understand. The author didn't say that is is. &gt; it was not hard to implement. The author didn't say that is is.
&gt; It is not mandatory &gt; If you don't like it then there's absolutely nothing preventing you from... not using it! it becomes "mandatory" when people you cooperate with start sprinkling their code with it to their heart's content. I envy you being a self-sufficient island.
I was addressing the general controversy over that operator. Also, the author said it was harder to read which is one measure of being able to understand it.
Are you sure you're in the right directory on the cmd? Type dir if you're on windows and see if the file is there (ls on linux). If python is installed the file should usually have a pyrhon icon instead of txt file on windows
If you don't establish and maintain coding conventions on your team, then you are just as much to blame as them.
Even with "the general controversy", I don't think I have seen anyone claiming that you MUST use the assignment operator, or that it is hard to understand. The concern I have expressed, and have seen others express, is that it allows novice programmers to write code that could be confusing, and for a very marginal gain. If you are ever working with a novice programmer, or think that you might in the future work with a novice programmer, it seems the better decision to just not use the assignment operator, and make the assignment explicit in the line above. Legibility is far more important in my mind than a slightly inflated line count.
You're probably more right than you think about the enhanced dictionary. When you learn advanced python you'll learn about "namespace" and how python organizes stuff as an association between name and object. Classes provide nice ways to use this for custom abstraction. [This blog post](http://code.activestate.com/recipes/577887-a-simple-namespace-class/) gets into some of this a lot better than I can. But of course, a great deal can be done with python without getting this fanciful abstract stuff, which makes python such a nice language imho.
Hmm.. thx! Any ideas how to do that? I have experience with wordpress but that would require some custom work

Hey, thanks! I'd love to hear the perspective of someone who actually does bio. Ah yeah, I've heard the "complexity of the eye" argument before. Like you said, it's not like it goes from light sensitive protein to full eye in one step, there were definitely steps like the formation of a sensing grid, then a crude lens, etc. Hmmm, I'm not sure it's a lack of functional atoms, unless I'm misunderstanding you. I agree that it's a pretty small subset of the search space (given basic nodes and a few functional atoms) that's actually a solution to a more complex problem. But to take the MUX example (in the blog post), that should only need NAND gates, which it had, and it still couldn't get it. I don't understand the analogous problem with gene expression: there are a ton of gene/codon combos that give rise to a million proteins, and those proteins trigger the creation of others, etc. But how does evolution "figure out" the sparse solutions in this huge search space? from my really limited understanding, I suspect that evolution (because it's a *really* incremental process with a really large number of individuals that get to "try" small adjustments) really gets to "go over" all the combinations before getting more complex. i.e., the "franken-network" in the post had a ton of NAND gates, when it really only needs 4 to create a MUX. I think that's because it kept adding them when it hadn't even searched all the ways 2 or 3 NAND gates could be wired up. Something that kinda confirms these suspicions is that when I decreased the "add node" rate, it took longer, but produced much simpler NNs. I might try a few patches to this. A really simple one could just be where every individual is limited to a certain number of nodes/connections, and after a long time of trying to evolve with that limit, the limit is raised slightly, and repeat. Similarly, I was thinking of adding some form of regularization, like a cost for adding nodes and weights. I like this because it has some biological basis (additions typically have some energy cost, so their benefits have to outweigh those costs to be accepted).
im using powershell because Idk how to open cmd in specific directory.

Idk why it looks like text file, when I look at file type it says 'PY file'. should this file be opening just like text file?

&gt;Brad Traversy’s django are you referring to this one? [https://www.udemy.com/python-django-dev-to-deployment/](https://www.udemy.com/python-django-dev-to-deployment/)
Yes. I think most people do. No Turing complete language can ever be idiot proof, and will always allow for some terrible code, but it should be obvious what not to write. Multi-line lambda has always been treated as "too complex for python", I'm not sure why assignment expressions were treated differently.
Yep. That’s the one.
hey, it strongly depends on where exactly your program is spending time. if it's in computing some quantities of interest, that can easily be lowered to C. if it's regex matching, not so much (make sure you are using [compiled](https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html#re.compile) regular expressions though. &amp;#x200B; anyway, when doing performance optimization, you should always measure first: where is your program spending most of its time? you can use cProfile to find which functions are hot, and line\_profiler to check which lines within those functions are the hottest.
I'll be starting it. I'll definitely let you know my reviews. Thank you!

If you have 1 particle, there are 0 interactions, if there are 2 particles there is only 1 interaction... 3 particles = 3 interactions 4 particles = 6 interactions ... the amount of Interactions grow quadraticaly.

Interestingly enough, I'm working on a service right now that allows you to run scripts like that and takes care of all the billing &amp; UI. Unfortunately we're only hosting our own stuff right now, and don't allow third party developers yet. You could potentially do it with wordpress, but it'd be a little tricky. There are two relatively easy ways i can think of: 1)You'd have to host it somewhere that has python installed (so probably not shared hosting) and write a custom module to call the python script from the php. 2) You put the script in the cloud somewhere like AWS lambda. You write a small custom php script to trigger the lambda function when someone uses your site. Both require a little bit of php, but hopefully not too much. Wish we were further along with our product and could help you out. Good luck.

I have ran out of Ideas this week so I am just expanding my library of CLI based games. Anyone got any ideas for anything else I could do?
I think you put it better than I did – the point I was trying to make is that yes, the 'size of the increment' that biological evolution gets to make is much smaller, and the population size is much larger. To me it seems like that's quite a large difference with what you're doing. I feel like the 'increment size' here is much larger. Additionally, in biology, there's a cost to having too many 'parts' (atoms), and so there is selective pressure to lose vestigial/underperforming 'parts'. Maybe you could try adding an option to lose atoms from one generation to the next? (If you're already doing this I missed it).
Yeah for sure. I’m about 70% done. I just have user logins and hosting to do. I’m curious what you think of it too.
&gt; Is 3,600 broken packages enough to block adoption of the PEP? I don't know. I just wanted to make sure that the impact the PEP was known before a final decision. A really important question. The other is how many of those broken packages will break other packages that depend on them? And so on in to infinity! Are any of those package actively being developed? If so is there a tool that will help them?
I dont try to be smartass, if i m wrong, prove me wrong, i d like to know ... As i said two particles are trivial case where all 2 vectors point straight to another particle, but as person who already coded newtonian gravity in at least 2 programming languages, i ve noticed that with more particles different stuff happens ..mostly when variable masses are used ...intuitively i understand that any number of particles have common center of mass and all the vectors should point straight into it but, maybe its just rounding errors, some planets orbits in unstable orbits ...it doesnt just all rush into the common center of mass and i always thought that reason is that gravitational force increases exponentially with smaller distances and when something randomly flies near another planet, it curves its path and gives it this sideway push that ultimately leads to some orbits. If I then imagine simulation with very high precision with smaller and smaller particles, i can easily see how this would at least occasionally lead to some orbits ...my point was that this is very unlikely to remain orbiting because we are rounding stuff and small difference can accumulate very quickly
&gt;it should be obvious what not to write. What is obvious to one person may not be obvious to another. And is that not what code reviews and mentoring is for? General coding standards like PEP8? Team-defined conventions? etc. The general way to use assignment expressions are easy enough to understand, just like the more basic list comprehensions.
All because Twisted devs are butthurt
Yes people do have different opinions about code complexity. That is the heart of the issue. What I don't understand is why this view prevented so many other additions (like multi-line lambda), but not assignment expressions. It seems a fundamental shift in the approach the language developers are taking.

&gt; Software with keys is pretty easy to crack. Only if you implement it poorly. For example, use RSA keys and sign any client key to confirm it is valid.
Personally, I find it much harder to justify multi-line lambdas than I do assignment expressions. The use cases are much more niche.

The use case of assignment operator seemed pretty niche to me. The main use being regex matching where it is common to use the C idiom of returning `None` for no match. But whatever you feel about multi-line lambda, surely you must think that `continue if...` and `break if...` are reasonable additions in light of the assignment operator.
Deprecations, not removals. So realistically, they will be removed in 3.10/4.0, meaning 3-4 years before removals. That's a lot of time.
I was really unhappy with the backwards incompatible changes they put in to 3.7. It caused all kinds of problems for me and my peers (and still does). Every day I get a new question from someone 'I'm getting this error about async...' Now they want to introduce more breaking changes that either mean staying on an older version or rewriting more code. I think they forgot what versioning is supposed to be like. The major version number, 3, means that there are no backwards incompatible changes. If they want to introduce changes that actually break other python3 code, they should actually start calling it Python 4. That's not what I want, but this idea of breaking and removing things from Python3 is really annoying. It's so confusing to people when they try to run something with 3.7 and then they have to downgrade to 3.6 because of the async issues. We're going to have to deal with crap this like in the future then: * My app isn't working any more that I upgraded Python! Oh, the new version breaks things? Ok I'll downgrade to 3.7 * My app still isn't working! It's complaining about async problems. Oh, 3.7 introduced backwards incompatible changes? Ok I'll downgrade to 3.6. * My app still doesn't work! Oh, half of my libraries I depend on only work with the newest version of Python now? Great! Half my libraries only work up to 3.6 and the other half only work &gt; 3.8. Python 3 rocks! They shouldn't call them dead batteries. They should call them load-bearing pillars. They aren't swapping out dead batteries with new ones so we can carry on happily, they are removing things that will cause other pieces to collapse. We are about to finally retire Python 2. Have we already forgotten about the pain of having a fractured set of libraries and trying to upgrade them through a backwards incompatible version? They are just inviting it all over again and it's going to be even more confusing because it's not as clear cut as "2 vs 3". It's going to be "3.0-3.6 vs 3.7 vs 3.8" or something. 'Has x been upgraded yet?' 'Dang, when is Y going to be upgraded?' 'I can't upgrade this until Q is fixed' Plus, don't get me started on the renaming of variables because they became 'offensive'. I wish Python would take a stance more like Linux. YOU DON'T BREAK USERSPACE! YOU DON'T BREAK USERSPACE! YOU DON'T BREAK USERSPACE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Yes, I agree those are similar. However, both of those examples change the way you use *already-existing* statements. There was no assignment expression before this PEP, it is an introduction as opposed to a change.
There is a type of statefull functions called closures. See also the nonlocal statement in python.
`break if COND` doesn't change anything. Its just sugar around: `if COND: break`. Yet despite the apparent simplicity of the proposal it was rejected, because: "It's another way to do the same thing." I cant fathom why a change that requires * no semantic change * no new keywords or operators * and only a modest change to the parser gets rejected like that, but assignment operators which are much more intrusive, are accepted.
&gt;Is 3,600 broken packages enough to block adoption of the PEP? IMHO, any change that introduces a backwards incompatibility should require a major version number change. When Python 3.7 code fails to work with Python 3.6, they are no longer part of the same major version number. The idea with versioning is that if you upgrade a MINOR version, it should have new features, but be backwards incompatible. The only time backwards incompatible changes should be introduced is if it is clearly labeled by a MAJOR version change.

Why do you need a exe file? There sre some solutions. But every one will come with a cost. If it is python3, you can easily use the portable official zip. But with a bat launcher made by you. Solutions like py2exe or pyinstaller are not so easy.
Ah sorry mate, I spoke some bullshit before. I was from my phone and wrote some stupid formulas there. Anyway, take a look at this: https://pastebin.com/adsm19Fe Not a Jupyter Notebook, but: 1. Is very simple. 150 lines of code 2. Uses OpenGL rendering (Pyglet) which eliminates the need for png generation 3. Uses some optimized arithmetic to make it possible to have 1-2 FPS in the first few frames with all 1000 objects in. 4. Uses numba.jit to take it to 30fps once it compiles and runs that function. Subsequent runs are super fast and smooth. The code is stupidly simple. I haven't even touched on linear algebra. You can do that if you want.

No, this game is actually finished...
Does the cpython project claim to follow semantic versioning?
&gt;Deprecations, not removals They are deprecation AND removals. Every single one of them has an entry under 'to be removed'. &gt;meaning 3-4 years before removals. Well, I guess you admit they **are** removals after all. &gt;That's a lot of time. It sounds like it, but just look how quickly we were able to move from Python 2 to Python 3. It only took about 3 years, right? To do some math, at 3,604 packages at 3 years time, that comes out to about *3.3 packages per day, every day for three years straight*, that will need to be fixed. Does that still sound like a lot of time?

Your variable names are fantastic
I'm glad at least one person enjoyed it.
It's already evident in 3.7 that they do not. I'm saying I wish they did.
hi, i need a .exe because i'm not even able to run python itself. i downloaded it and i was confused how to use it, as i said already, i'm a total noob and dont think i'm able to learn python ever, because its totally overwhelming me, with all these files and commands, and i dont even have a gui/window. i wasnt even able to compile it or whatever how its going to be started &amp;#x200B; i was searching for a very simple online converter, but even this doesnt exist &amp;#x200B; but well, i see how this will goes nvm, seems i have found the end of the road with such small task for you guys its problably a 5 seconds job, for me it would take 1-2 weeks or even longer &amp;#x200B; whatever, hf bye thread can be closed/deleted :/
Please follow the official tutorial
Will i get help there, without having to learn python by myself? If so thanks, otherwise i'm stuck with my problem and dont need to ask there, sadly.

Why does the notebook have JavaScript code? Shouldn't it be Python?
I'm out of the loop here, can you elaborate?
https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2019/05/amber-brown-batteries-included-but.html &gt;Brown’s most controversial opinion, in her own estimation, is that adding modules to the standard library stifles innovation, by discouraging programmers from using or contributing to competing PyPI packages. Ever since asyncio was announced she has had to explain why Twisted is still worthwhile, and now that data classes are in the standard library Hynek Schlawack must defend his attrs package. Though I don't disagree here: &gt;“We should embrace PyPI,” she exhorted. Some ecosystems such as Javascript rely too much on packages, she conceded, but there are others like Rust that have small standard libraries and high-quality package repositories. She thinks that Python should move farther in that direction. But it goes back to should we start removing things or just stop adding more to stdlib and work on bringing quality up in the "leaky batteries".
ahhh haha yeah, I see, sorry I didn't understand what you meant. Yeahhh... in papers I've read, they often use much bigger populations, but even these take a while to run on my dinky laptop. I do remove weights, but not atoms at the moment... I might add that next time. Thanks for the feedback and stuff!
Interesting, so instead of contributing to the standard library for their relevant module, their response is to not contribute and then complain that it doesn't get enough contributions. Your quote is relevant, but the quote that stood out to me was, &gt; Guido van Rossum, sitting at the back of the room, interrupted at this moment, “Can you keep to one topic? I'm sorry but this is just one long winding rant. What is your point?” I kinda LOLed.
I think it's Kotlin since that's made by JetBrains. Well that and the "*Powered by Kotlin" text ;)

No one actually does. My teacher gave us the solution and told us to figure it out ourselves.
Nice! Looks great. Any plans to support &gt;3 discs?
theres a tool called pyinstaller, install it via pip &amp;#x200B; [https://www.pyinstaller.org/](https://www.pyinstaller.org/) &amp;#x200B; it will convert ur python script to a .exe, i've used it before. &amp;#x200B; cheers
If it doesn't then why did we make such a big deal about python3?
Could I suggest http://gist.github.com to post code? And there is good response to web2py questions on Stack Overflow as well as their Google Group.
Whether or not the standard library does in fact stifle innovation, the fact that a package author refused to be included in the standard library (I'm thinking of attrs), is a sign of a serious disconnect between the core language devs, and the library authors. Inclusion into the standard library should be an honor to be welcomed, not a burden to be refused. Clearly the relationship between these communities is not healthy.
"On Windows systems, there is no notion of an “executable mode”. The Python installer automatically associates .py files with python.exe so that a double-click on a Python file will run it as a script. The extension can also be .pyw, in that case, the console window that normally appears is suppressed." &amp;#x200B; Found that in the Help Files - Python 2.7 &amp;#x200B; So actually it tells me, that i dont need to start anything else other than the [extract.py](https://extract.py) to start the process. but if i do this, nothing happens - cmd pops on and out - thats it &amp;#x200B; if i do it manually over cmd with python extract.py, it says "Der Befehl "python" ist entweder falsch geschrieben oder konnte nicht gefunden werden." &amp;#x200B; thanks for trying to help me, but thats what i was saying before.. this python stuff is a book with seven seals to me - i tried it a lot times over the last years sometimes, and i never got python working for me &amp;#x200B; so all i actually do, is wasting my time again for many hours, learning things i dont want to learn, learning things i cant use or have any progress so far.. &amp;#x200B; i tried it again, but nah.. done here this was the last time i downloaded python, if i ever found python as only solution again for any tool problem like converting/unpacking whatever, then I will stop the experiment immediately and accept that there is no real solution for casual users &amp;#x200B; thx for nothing

There are some good answers here, but I really like [this blog post](https://eev.ee/blog/2013/03/03/the-controller-pattern-is-awful-and-other-oo-heresy/) by Eevee. It really cuts to the heart of the matter: write classes if and only if they produce sensible objects, which are bundles of meaningful state and behavior. Otherwise, don't.
What library did you use for the gui?
Big overstatement; I'm pretty sure many of the package I maintain are importing \`imp\` and are thus considered "to be broken", though I have conditional imports for them to work across version. Turn Warnings into errors in your test suite and you usually have about 3 years (2x18 month between Python version) between deprecation and removal, more if you test on nightly/alpha/beta. Keeping up to date with latest Python has always been a breeze if you don't wait until the last minute. They removed the packages and you need them ? So what: copy past them in a repository and publish them on PyPI . You are in a closed environment ? Vendor them. You are running an app and control the deployment ? You are free to stay on older python version. Python dev are working for free, and diligently documenting every deprecated and potential removal. If you catch that too late that's kind of your fault. You want the core libraries to be better maintain ? Give the the PSF or contribute back.

Some of the shit yall do makes me so jealous. Can't wait to get to that level.
Your code is correct but where you put your files isn’t, I don’t use windows but I assume you will have to keep your files all in one thing and don’t rename it and don’t move it!
What exactly is "end of life" like programs will no longer work or is it just not receiving any kind of updates?
Maybe it will no longer work
No update.
I’m learning the requests lib and how to interact with websites via python to put together a content aggregator. I’ll need to dive into Django or Flask to get a website out together but that will have to be learnt in the future 😁
Functions are objects and you can add all sorts of weird stuff to them.
Not true. Existing programs will continue to work. How can they stop working?

I've started to learn python this week. What I've could achieve, it's a bot that scrape data of stock prices from a web, then edit a text layer of a psd base pic with that data, export it as PNG, and finally tweet the pics. I'm looking forward to learn and to improve my skill. Sorry for my English, I'm from Argentina
I mean it will no longer working if you write python2 code in 2020 and thats just my opinion.
The turtle library uses Tk I believe.
Maaaaaybe something like Y2K. But, i think it is clearly not the case in this context.
Does the format support "sync points" like corners on QR codes so you could point a camera at a BitGlitter feed and read the data in real time, in the real world?
It would be nice to have some stats on how widely used the packages that would be broken are. Uploading a package to PyPI is super-easy and I would guess that the large majority of PyPI packages are unmaintained and unused. If the deprecation breaks a bunch of unmaintained packages that no one depends on, then that's completely fine. Number of packages isn't a very meaningful metric without more information/context.
The toaster grows an arm and stabs you.
It can mean a variety of things typically it means that there will be very little to no more updates on python 2 libraries, which most importantly means there are no security updates, and thus certain online programs will become unsafe.

Not 100% related I think, but is there any better API for spreadsheet formatting than xlsxwriter's? I wish I could just do it as if I were using Excel... For example, in Excel if you want to make crossing borders you paint an horizontal border on selected cells (say A1:M1) and a vertical border on other selected cells (say A1:A20) - these borders do not override themselves. In xlsxwriter I have to do something like this: formats = { 'border_right': {'right': 2}, 'border_bottom': {'bottom': 2}, 'border_right_bottom': {'bottom': 2, 'right': 2}, } formats = { key: workbook.add_format(value) for key, value in formats.items() } cell_formats = { 'A1:A1': 'border_right', 'A2:A2': 'border_right_bottom', 'A3:A38': 'border_right', 'B2:C2': 'border_bottom', 'D1:D1': 'border_right', 'D2:D2': 'border_right_bottom', 'D3:D38': 'border_right', } for key, value in cell_formats.items(): cond_format = {'type': 'no_errors', 'format': formats[value]} worksheet.conditional_format(key, cond_format) Looks like a really big chuck of code for something fairly simple
OK, where the person here who keeps telling me that the PSF is definitely going to extend the deadline again?
In particular, when you have a collection of functions with shared state, that's probably a good time to use a class. In an RPG, perhaps a character can be healed by `heal(x)` and be damaged by `take_damage(x)`. The shared state operated on by both functions is their current health. That signifies that a class for characters is a good idea, and the alternatives all more or less amount to re-implementing classes.
Done.

I killed my libraries support for python 2 last Friday. It feels good to get rid of six, future, scans it, and pathlib2 and really start doing type annotations properly. People are already trying to get me to change my mind. But my company uses Anaconda...use a virtual environment; Anaconda lets you have multiple versions of python. It’s coming like a train and all my dependencies have moved on. Time for me to as well.
I dunno. Every new version of python and half of the time numpy or scipy release a new version my code stops working. So I typically fix it in an hour or so because I have good tests. What’s one more minor update? I try to fix those warnings anyways. If you want you can ignore them for years, but you probably shouldn’t.
Dropping support for python 2.7 in a release doesn’t require a major version bump. Assuming you follow semver, as long as your package works with your supported version with no changes, you can make it part of a bug fix release. Most packages ignore semver though.
Throw it in the bathtub...
They don’t and they break things. I have to make updates to my tests nearly every version. They’re not huge changes, but why the fuck do you expect the to follow it? They have said very clearly that they don’t.
It means that very soon after some security vulnerability will be published, and applications like Calibre or Deluge will become malware hosts if they don't switch to Py3 by then.

hey, I sure do! What aspect are you interested in? If you're into the evolutionary algorithm aspect, the Wikipedia article on it gives a good overview: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_algorithm If you're interested in neuroevolution, Kenneth Stanley's NEAT paper is old but really cool: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroevolution_of_augmenting_topologies (and he's done a ton since then, like HyperNEAT and a million cool variants) Google "neural architecture search" to find papers on building NN's at a higher level (like sticking CNN layers together to form the best NN).
You can't really End of Life open source software like python. GPL compatible means irrevocability of copy-lefts. Business and end users who still use python 2 will support it without resources from the PSF. Large projects that never left python2 will switch to that repository/code base. An entire desktop environment was created around gnome 2's deprecation. Python 2.7 is going to live on forever, a monument to poor project management decisions regarding backwards compatibility.
Nice! Congratulations! Keep it up!

My problem with this is that lots of distros are shipping python 2 still.....
That's a bit of an over-simplification. If there's an unpatched security vulnerability in Python, someone needs to somehow access your computer to exploit the Python code running Caliber, for example.
Or have it load a specially crafted file - depends on the exploit. Imagine developing a hostile epub that when loaded in calibre downloads and installs a trojan. Then you publish this epub (or more likely thousands of them) to warez sites.
Python 3 has been in development over 11 years (since 2008). It's perfectly fine to cut the cord after a decade. &amp;nbsp; If CentOS and other distributions can't be bothered to update, that's not really Python's fault.
Add another one. Excellent tutorials.
dude, why randomly use Vietnamese here? You do realise that tower of Hanoi is actually not popular at all in Hà Nội right?
I agree, but I’m just saying that’s a serious concern.
Oh, i see a "Ha Noi Tower" and think this is a topic of Vietnam human, So why i can't comment by Vietnamese dude? About " Hanoi is actually not popular at all in Hà Nội ",I think everyone students used learn IT in Viet Nam had know it
&gt; I think everyone students used learn IT ~~in Viet Nam~~ had know it I thought that OP was Vietnamese too and this was an inside joke. BTW tower of Hanoi is not Hà Nội tower in any sense. Jusk ask any of your friend who has not formally or informally studied algorithm about the game, they would give you the *dude, that's new* face I promise.
Where can i get the goodybag?
I feel like python 2 has been around for ever and now that we're on 3, 4 is right around the corner
The code: import numpy as np from matplotlib import pyplot as plt from scipy.signal import convolve2d f = np.zeros((100, 100)) for t in range(10000): f[40:60, 40:60] = abs(np.sin(np.pi * t / 1000)) f += convolve2d(f, [[0, 1, 0], [1, -4, 1], [0, 1, 0]], mode='same') * .1 plt.imsave(f'/out/h{t}.png', f, cmap='hot', vmin=0, vmax=1)
But a necessary pain. If we keep pushing it for that fear we'll never get rid of Python 2 lol.
Shipping or using it as the default? It makes sense that they would still ship it while it's supported.
A recent data analysis example for me: * I have a bunch of simulations of "thrusters" and "robots." Each robot has multiple thrusters. * Each individual simulation corresponds to ***one*** data point in a bigger-picture comparison study. Each simulation's data (input parameters and output results) are spread across multiple files on disk. * Overall, I want to combine data from many simulations into an "analysis" that makes up a parametric study (thruster performance vs. frequency) or other comparison (performance of very different robot designs) * Several analyses will be discussed in a report in a Jupyter notebook. Each analysis needs to load, transform, and summarize the data in a very similar way, and then I'm going to plot results comparing them. * Most of the required data processing is done for the thrusters, even in a robot simulation. * The robot has a few extra data processing tasks that don't apply to thruster simulations, like summarizing the robot's center-of-mass motion. So I've got a module I import into my Jupyter notebook that contains: * A base `Analysis` class that loads, stores, and organizes the common raw data for either a thruster or a robot analysis. * A `ThrusterAnalysis` class that inherits the from the `Analysis` class to get the common data loading methods and defines all the methods for processing thruster data. * A `RobotAnalysis` class that inherits from the `ThrusterAnalysis` class to get the data loading and thruster processing methods. It also defines some extra methods needed to finish the robot analysis. Robots always have thrusters, so the inheritance here makes a ton of sense. &amp;#x200B; I prefer a module full of functions in many cases, after writing a few useless classes that have that "awkward collection of methods for no reason" flavor. But here I want to start by gathering a lot of related, small pieces of data from a bunch of sources. I want to organize the data from all those sources into one place. And I want to transform and summarize that re-organized data using some common, fairly complex processing code. There's a hierarchy that makes inheritance useful. So classes made sense to me. They also give nice namespaces to organize results of extra analysis conducted in the report itself... loop over all the analyses computing a curve fit to power vs. frequency: for thr in [thrA, thrB]:

Red Hat will support py2 for a few more years. With those patches then going to centos, that's all people will need to keep using it.
It doesn't claim to AFAIK, but very roughly it does.
Now that you have heard of Python 3, now get ready for Python 4! \[/s\] But seriously, we need to start moving on from Py2. It's a dead horse meat now.
Using as default, `which python` yields path to python 2 binary on most distros. That being said, after 1/1/20 this will slowly change for better
I'm having an issue with running some code on a high-performance cluster. The cluster only has 3.4, and my code is all written for 3.6. The sysadmin is out at the moment, and I'd really like to run my code. Is there a way I can do any kind of install without any sort of privileged user status? The virtualenv install on the cluster only goes to 2.6, and ipython is configured for 2.7.

I didn't really like the walrus operator; couldn't see a great need for it. But I know what it is now and, while I personally won't use it all that much, it is easy to identify when it shows up in code and even easier to follow the logic. (Unless you're doing something stupid like writing *if* blocks that are a hundred lines long and indented five or six times. This wailing I see about it, about the much greater impediment it creates for people learning the language, is massively overblown. It is **one extra thing** to **possibly** learn among several dozen basic things, several hundred more advanced things and about a thousand gotchas. I don't see it as being any different to the *finally* statement in *try/except* blocks. You don't have to use it, but when you do see it, it certainly stands out as something you will need to learn about if you want to understand the code.

 &gt;Python is used in science for data analysis, not for computationally intensive calculations - for these kinds of calculations people use mostly programs in Fortran (scientists change slowly) or C/C++. I'm sorry but this is a very outdated viewpoint. Yes of course tons of research stuff is Fortran bc legacy and old professors, but plenty of new profs use Python for many reasons. For example, have you heard of Dask? Or Numba? Both of these tools allow for extremely performant Python code and both are relatively easy to add to a codebase. Further not every single thing written needs to be as perfectly fast as possible---with the right tools in Python you can get to basically just as fast as C/Fortran for many classes of problems, because all Python does is wrap a C or Fortran library for that, and that overhead is very minimal. But then you can scale it out with Dask to 100 worker nodes without even changing your code except an import statement. Sure as hell beats trying to teach a grad math student Fortran, compilers, MPI, etc in a single semester and expecting them to write code that can be read, installed, or used by anyone after.
I've read the first few page of tutorial. I'm still a Django developer.
Well unfortunately until the DCC's (Maya, Nuke, Houdini) and our project management system (shotgun) change the interpreters to py3 we'll be such with it. Has anyone seen much about what Autodesk, Foundry, etc have said about support for py3?
 &gt;Wh... What? Python is just wrapper for C? That's not correct at all. What exactly do you think happens when you call `a * b` when `a` and `b` are numpy arrays?
*Really* depends on what you're doing.
You should probably look at using Pandas for a first step.
To everyone who could not be arsed to look at the Python 2 to 3 update guides for the past however many years: Stop it. Get some help.
It is not so much a question of how to change a variable, but where this value can be found. It makes it easier to keep track of the different values your program uses.
Good bot
Okay so looking at this code, you say you're using numpy, but you really aren't. Like I mean it's there but you're not using numpy functions; you're iterating through the pixels manually (which you should basically never do, because it's extremely slow in Python). Proper vectorizing of this code would probably make it hundreds of times faster.
This should help, does use another module but it is a baked in one in python 3. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28259301/how-to-convert-an-xml-file-to-nice-pandas-dataframe
Just started using python. Learned python 2 because of the systems and frameworks I’m using at work. This last week I started moving all things possible to python 3 in anticipation for it becoming the default on coming OSs. Holy hell does it make a lot of things easier. Basic threading in 3 makes me wish I could rewrite the frameworks my work uses so I could make the full jump over and never look back.
No worries my man, good luck!
Lol, I'm not saying that. But OP was acting like pure Python is compiled into C which is not true.

Man your attitude is going to help you learn shit. The internet doesn't owe you anything. Setting your windows os to English and googling your problem would turn up an answer in seconds. The reason your windows cmd doesn't recognize the Python command is because you haven't added it to your Windows paths. So do that.

Right now, this is entirely digital-digital compression. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrY4deFrOoA Pause the video, and drag the position button to the first frame. You'll see a checkerboard pattern along the top and left edges. That is what the reader uses to lock on to the first frame, as well as subsequent ones. Once the reader knows the scan geometry of the frame, those values persist throughout the read, so calibration stuff after the first frame is no longer necessary. That's one example of something you can do with digital transmission only barcodes that you can't do in the physical world (where you need constant reference points as the object or the scanner itself is moving around). The project is a unique hybrid of the barcode concept.
I‘m not sure I’d use **str.format** =&gt; _f-string_ as an example, since f-strings _cannot_ replace **str.format** fully, at least not unless/until lazily-evaluated [i-strings](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0501/) drop. There already is a mechanism for this, really, at least for anything that has been officially marked with DeprecationWarning/FutureWarning or PendingDeprecationWarning. Getting everybody to move to new features that are _preferred_, but are unlikely to ever be actually deprecated is a different, organizational policy issue. For that I’d tend to use `pylint` as it’s got pretty good opinions, and you can even go further and write [custom checkers](http://pylint.pycqa.org/en/latest/how_tos/custom_checkers.html) to address anything it isn’t opinionated _enough_ about.
I don't have MacOS, but if it's anything like popular Linux distros, a lot will depend on python2. I have 2 guesses on what could work: 1. Copy the files back. If your file manager won't work and you've never used terminal, this can be a bit dangerous. 2. There were more dependencies needed than only python2. Like python2-requests or anything like that. I'd search on how to list installed packages and reinstall all that start with python.
You want to disable classes?! Hope no one needs custom loggers or needs to abstract API calls. I'm sure you can write a tool that navigates a UI without any classes. 10000 line files is fine

&gt; Basic threading You mean asyncio, I guess? It's not really "threading"...
I don't think 4 is anywhere in sight, really. The BDFL succession is still very fresh and nobody quite agrees on what 4 should bring. By all accounts, we will get a 3.10, 3.11 and so on, before 4.0 is even planned.
It's already there! Just download and run my code on GitHub
I did. However, I do not recommend Turtle for anything. It's a pretty outdated module. It originally came from Python 2 and some development made it able to be ran in Python 3, but it's still built for Python 2 and will not receive updates anymore.
Thank you😉
The lack of inheritance is actually what's holding back UI frameworks in rust
I don't understand why it takes so long. For ages python 2 comes with tools that help you to migrate to python 3 smoothly. Python code isn't even that hard to port in most cases. It's it because of C libraries?
Guido has said previously they don't plan on that. It'll go straight from 3.9 to 4.0 and it'll be treated no differently than 3.6 to 3.7
I know lots of scientists who use python 2 because it's faster than python 3. I haven't used python for my code for about three years but last time I checked py2 was about 20% - 30% faster than py3, and that's when using things like numpy and another library which was an interface to some fortran code. So when you're running things that take a week, that's a day and a half's difference. Is python 3 faster now?
Whoa, it's retarded `format` still has it's uses The walrus operator is GREAT, since it allows for things like if let and while let from languages like rust (seems like a dumb/niche concept at first but is so damn useful) and also more efficient comprehensions. I don't agree with the `:=` Symbol though but that's another Story. And as for disable class... Yeah, No If you don't like it, don't use it
You might not have noticed Guido is not BDFL anymore. Yes, 4.0 will not be a big break like 3.0 was, but it won't necessarily follow 3.9 - there are PEPs already mentioning 3.10+, and it was agreed on python-dev that it's much more likely that 3.10 will happen than 4.0.
In total agreement with you except for the type annotations. I see those as an abomination. Python is so beautiful as a syntax without those horrible glyphs. Quote the PEP: ```While these annotations are available at runtime through the usual __annotations__ attribute, no type checking happens at runtime . Instead, the proposal assumes the existence of a separate off-line type checker which users can run over their source code voluntarily``` See? An abomination. I'll never introduce those in my personal projects.
Just started learning python 3 today all thanks to you. Keep up the good work, we appreciate it!
What is tower of hanoi?
Things that needs to run for weeks or even days to finish, shouldn't be written in python. (Not speaking of periodic jobs). And if your answer is that the runtime is mainly executing lower level code, then switching between python 2 and 3 shouldn't make a lot of difference.
Part of following semantic versioning is declaring that you do in the first place. So I guess they don't then.
ahh, the Python Safety Federation...../s
Learner here, does this mean I should uninstall any/all version of python2 on my laptop along with libraries??? (I'm already using python 3.6 for all my projects, just wondering if I should keep python2)
Modules `xml` or `re` are what you want
As I understand, Maya can be run using Python 3. One of my workmates told me there’s a sneaky configuration setting.
You can always use the fork from the guy who made Calibre, whatever it is.
If it's a version of python 2 you installed yourself, then yeah, sure. However, if it's a version of python 2 that came installed with the system, it's best not to touch it - your OS is probably using that for some internal stuff and you don't know what you might break if you try to remove it.
Or access a port, maybe? Both Calibre and Deluge have server capabilities.
Thanks for the source code I've been trying to learn Tk and turtle so that i could move along to the other libraries, this will help a lot
The whole point is that you can, optionally, do static type checking. And it works very well in practice.

does your VNC viewer accept command line arguments?
Some corporation may provide paid support for a custom python distro (Anaconda?) and that's okay. Psf may as well, but not the official repo. That's it. I can still install python 1.6 and it works and until some years ago, some companies supported their embedded py 1.6 setups.
Use programs that provide API. Like this https://cf.realvnc.com/fr/developer/docs/latest/api/python/index.html
It's hard, and depend on so many factors that it's impossible to say.
I’m not sure, how would I find that out?
Ok I’ll look into this! Thanks for the response!
Fine, I will do it!
I love these forms of graphical programming, but they don't scale very well. They are great for basic programming and teaching, but past that, it's better to move to text files.
One thing I particularly hate about Pandas is the agg() method. Back in the day you could name the output columns using the dictionary syntax it is already using, but somebody removed it without adding a replacement way. They also didn't have a good reason to remove it either. Now you end up with a column name which is pretty damn useless and you have to type a couple lines of code to format your stuff nicely. It's just plain stupid. There is a massive thread on it in the Pandas bug tracker with 99% of people just agreeing the removal of naming the output columns was asinine and that they want the feature back.
The switch isn't as bad as you are probably thinking.
Nice try. If you really don't know (since this is /r/learnpython), see the attached video of this post.
Why do people want this? It would be a huge time sink and source of compatibility problems, akin to the Python 3 "debacle" x100; a monumental decrease in usability and simplicity; the death of Python for small scripts. For what?
Alternatively you can use something like [pywinauto](https://pywinauto.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) ([examples](https://github.com/pywinauto/pywinauto/tree/master/examples)) or [similar](https://pywinauto.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#some-similar-tools-for-comparison).
Maybe they aren't as useful as they could be, but how else could you write typed code without a performance penalty? If you checked type at runtime everything would slow to a glacial crawl...
There's no evidence of that at all. We aren't ever going to do a non-backwards compatible version of Python ever again. The 2-&gt;3 change was _so_ painful, and more, got rid of nearly every glaring problem extant!
I started to learn with a pi-top (raspberry pi). Its got all the resources you need on there plus a game which helps you learn python. Currently learning how to code a game on pygame. Book from magpi worth £3.99 gets you from programming shapes to applying physics to a game.
Or if you go on the site, it's free to download plus loads of there mags on there pdf.
&gt; It'll go straight from 3.9 to 4.0 What?! Where did he say this?! What sense does that make? The world uses [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/), where a move from 3.9 to 4.0 is a major breaking change. More, I'll bet there is a ton of code that says, `if python_version_tuple()[0] == 3:` which would simply break overnight for no reason.
I don't see that a 4.0 is necessary or desirable. What new features do we have that are worth a breaking change? I can't name one. If it isn't a breaking change, then what point is there updating the major version number? I'd be really happy to see Python v3.32.23 someday. It would indicate decades of steady progress with no disruptions. It would mean that code I am writing today will still run with no changes.
I dont have a background on computer science, I studied and work in business. Since the recent growth of data, I started to learn data analytics via python. As I use reddit very often, I subscribe to both python and dataisbeautiful sub reddit so I can lurk around and occasionally learn a thing or two. So yeah, i really dont know what it is, and since Hanoi is my hometown, lol, so I was curious when i read this post today. But I genuinely do not know what it is.
If done right it will be no difference for "small scripts". It is possible to have a snapshot of selected modules optionally shipped with full Python package for instance.
&gt; I haven't used python for my code for about three years but last time I checked py2 was about 20% - 30% faster than py3 That hasn't been true since Python 3.6 or before. Python 3.7 should be faster in every way than Python 2. The `numpy` interface was never different in performance. All the heavy lifting in `numpy` is done by the underlying binary library. If your Python version is affecting your performance, you should rewrite your application so Python itself isn't on the critical path, and get an order of magnitude improvement and not just a few percent. Plain Python is slow. If your scientists are waiting for pure Python operations to grind through, they are a few equations short of a theorem. The tiny speed changes between Python 2 and 3 wouldn't change anyone's life in the slightest, either way.
I fail to see what you "see" in this quote. I personally don't use type annotation in my current python project, but it's only due to the nature of what I'm doing. It's probably your case too and that's why you fail to see why it can be useful to have static type checking. But in many cases, adding types is fast and simple, it serves as a documentation, helps autocompletion and saves you a lot of debugging time (because you will obviously have less typing errors). The best part is: it's optional, so you can very well add types to sensitives part of your code (low level, widely used code) and leave high level functions signatures untyped and documented them using docstrings. Have a look at the javascript ([ECMAScript](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/ECMAScript)) community and you'll see that many people are using flow or typescript annotations, even tho it's not as [clean](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3107/) as mypy+python because it requires transpilation (in order to remove annotations and get the javascript code back to standard).
&gt; Python 2.7 is going to live on forever, a monument to poor project management decisions regarding backwards compatibility. Probably true, but probably uninteresting to most of us, since we won't see them.
I have been working in 3.x exclusively now for some years, but I recently took out support for 2.x from a couple of old libraries and it was like getting a little stone out of my shoe. Interestingly 3.4 is now a slight pain point - there are a couple of CI tools like `mypy` that are only available for Python 3.5 onwards. In new development, I don't support 3.4, but I haven't yet removed it from old libraries that have existing users because why make their lives miserable?

Well as u/toyg said, its not up to him anymore and there will be a 3.10 But for what it's worth, he said it here: http://www.curiousefficiency.org/posts/2014/08/python-4000.html
If you believe that one guy who wanted to write his GUI in exactly the same way he did it in C++.
Functional reactive/actor model/MVU type stuff is a healthy alternative to OOP class hierarchies for GUI stuff. Not saying it's a panacea, but it's what I'd do. I'm also not arguing to remove the class keyword, lol!
So what's the point?
Finally
No idea what you're talking about; I can totally see the difficulty in UI stuff coming from Python and knowing a bit of C#
This, pretty much.

It isn't bad, but it does scale with the size of your code base. 2to3 only covers some basics, many behavioural differences are more subtle. And python being interpreted you'll discover errors at run time, so will need good test coverage or do a lot of testing.
Still a simple yet interesting use for it in my opinion.
Chech out the books by Al Sweigart for more ideas such as https://inventwithpython.com
No, python2 does not come with tools that help you migrate to python 3, 2to3 is *not* something you want to use outside of very small projects. You need to use six and python-future, and it’s helping but not perfect at all. Python code is hard to port if you don’t have very good test coverage because you h
You done goofed. Never mess with the system install of Python 2 on macOS, a lot of stuff depends on it. If you're unable to put the files back where you found them, you might have to reinstall macOS. This is usually non-destructive (if you don't erase the disk that is). You can safely install Python 3.7(.3 at the moment) without interfering with the system Python. You will just need to refer to it as python3 when calling it, likewise pip3 for packages. One method to install Python 3 is to download it from python.org and manually install it. This is the way I used to do it, but I rather install it via homebrew now. You can install homebrew by going to http://brew.sh and following the instructions there. Then to install python3 is just a matter of typing `brew install python3` in a terminal. Updating it is much the same too.
1. /r/learnpython, or even /r/learnmachinelearning 2. Your "train" score is the result on your training dataset, i.e. the data you trained the model on. Your "valid" score is the result on your validation dataset, i.e. the part of the data that you initially put aside to _not_ use in training. The reason it's done is because this way you can be somewhat sure that your model is actually functional on data it hasn't seen before - if you train the model on the entire dataset, it's possible you'll overfit it so much it will only respond correctly to inputs from your original dataset.
I find classes useful for representing distinct data types. Similar to where you would use data types or structs in eg Haskell or F#. &amp;#x200B; eg, you can represent a UUID read from the command-line, as a 'str' object, or as a UUID object. &amp;#x200B; The UUID object's construction would always fail a lot closer to the source, for invalid data. Later functions which take an UUID object don't need to check that the object contains a valid UUID-formatted string. UUIDs passed along as raw strings need to be constantly re-validated as being in a "valid" format, just in case hey haven't been validated as valid UUIDs sometime earlier on. &amp;#x200B; Also, as types, they act both as documentation of programmer intent, and allow better static checks (eg mypy) to help validate that your logic makes sense (eg: error if a string with arbitrary contents (which might be a UUID now, but which could be something invalid sometime in the future, eg user typos) is passed to a function where a UUID is meant to be passed in).
&gt; Python 2.7 will not get security updates after Jan 1st, 2020. Depends.
Thanks for the prompt reply. So the score result for my train and valid(test) should be close to one another? If a score is like 0.9 vs 0.7, does it mean that my trained model is not good enough?
Your score on the validation dataset will generally be lower than the score on the training dataset - that's normal.

Like what? Looking at what's new in 3.7 it doesn't suggest that there would be any compatibility issue with 3.6 unless you happened to have a variable named `async` or the like. I've certainly moved from one point release of python to another without issues from the core.
You're telling me there is money to be made maintaining a safe version of Python 2.

&gt; If your scientists are waiting for pure Python operations to grind through, they are a few equations short of a theorem. No need for insults. As I said, the python acts as an interface to some low level fortran solvers. And as I said, when it was looked at before, the difference was about 20%, which is significant.
I was taking about this guy: https://hackernoon.com/why-im-dropping-rust-fd1c32986c88
The solvers are written in fortran but they're called from python. It did make a difference, but as I mentioned it's been a few years.
Flask can handle big websites just fine.
lol thanks :)
thanks :)
it implies that I am singlehandedly controlling the coding conventions for the team, or that my team would speak with one voice (because that shit went so smooth among the core python devs, amirite?), and that there are no other teams who merge their stuff into the same codebase out of sight. in practice the language features are viral.
People usually prefer Django because of all the plugins. I actually find it a downside because it makes the base framework bulkier then needed. I have built complete backends in flask and it works well
Eventually all those products will have to switch to Python 3 so I wouldn't worry about it that much. I know they are thinking about it.
It really doesn't.
I prefer flask since you add what you want rather than have a bunch of excess stuff.
Any specific quide how to deal with the transition of the the Python C API as apparently this will be different in Python3? Mayb it will be a good opportunity to switch to PyBind11.
I'm pretty sure CentOS is going to Python 3 with RHEL in version 8.

You joke, but there’s talk on the python-dev mailing list about what’s going to happen after 3.9: 3.10 or 4.0? I can’t believe it’s even a discussion, going to 4.0 would be a catastrophe, even without significant breaking changes like 2-&gt;3.

This question gets asked all the time and the general consensus is if you use Flask for an extended project, you eventually end up building your own sub-par version of Django. If you build a giant Django project, eventually you will wish you split out various functionality across a bunch of micro-services. One is not superior to the other, as they serve entirely different needs. For me the answer to the question depends on which kind of data model best supports your application requirements. If a strong relational model makes sense use Django. If a document store/NoSQL model makes sense, use Flask.
Why I’m the world are you getting downvoted? I’m interested in seeing this transition as well.
The Doomsday clock is ticking.
So, you're saying that Python 3 is the default for `python3`, without a mention for `python`. Thanks Jeff.
Try the `pyupgrade` and `future` libraries - they do a lot more than `2to3` :-)
3.4 reached end of life in March, so there are no more security updates for it and many libraries have already dropped support.

program --help or documentation
How much would a one-time project like that usually cost?
I compile my interpreter through a GUI on a proxy. Those scrubswill never find me.
Before type annotations, I used to have a lot of comments explaining the types of various parameters and variables.
You might want to work on your attitude problem. The operator clearly has legitimate use cases. You may not find them useful to you, but enough people found it reasonable that it made it into the language. If you want to prevent people from using it within a codebase (which can make sense) you can make a linting rule for it. It should be very straight forward. Coupled with type inference you should be able to restrict almost any function/method/syntax.
Looks cool, keep it up!
There probably is, however I would expect RedHat etc. will be on it since they anyway need to support RHEL distros which depend on having safe Python2 for quite a few more years.
This is true. The version in RedHat will get updates until 2024, and the version in Ubuntu 18.04 will get updates until April 2023.
That's great for the Linux users who are already on RHEL, or can switch distro easily...
Which isn’t even close to being released yet. Maaaaybe around December if it takes the same amount of time after rhel7.
Ew. Why would someone spend that much effort on a broken version of Python?
Futurize did more harm than good when we tried out. It tries to paper over the genuinely different string semantics, and left us with something broken that we understood even less than what we started with. Modernize is more conservative, and in our experience, gives a better starting point. If you've got a big codebase, you've still got an uphill battle ahead of you. Also, use mypy type hints. In general, I hate them, but they're really helpful for clarifying type usage in legacy codebases.
Yes. Several vendors (RedHat and ActiveState being the best known) are already offering this.
I wouldn’t mind if the video was actually interesting, but it’s not :(
But DO install python3 alongside the system python and use 3 for everything!
I think you missed the point - just like other people who downvoted my comment above. It's a 1 character difference. Just start your python program with python3 instead of python. Python 2.x has been around for a long time (couple decades actually). It's difficult for any OS to switch the default for "python" to 3 instead of 2, because too many scripts, tools, etc might misinterpret that for python2 (some distros have tried for years and keep postponing for that reason). Or you can put python3 in the shebang and let the shell call take care of it. "python3" has been around in parallel for years and probably will be there for the foreseeable future for similar reasons. And it will always be interpreted as python 3.x. How difficult do you think it is to write 1 more character?
Tbh I don't have anything against Py2 being present on my system, just rebind `python` to py3 and rebind existing scripts to use python2 binary
No, but python breaks less frequently than other things and they release less often. Python is really good about not breaking things, but when they do, they tend to rip the bandaid off. Yes, they break things when they screwed up or find an optimization in something like dictionaries m....zither switch in 3.5 broke my code. It’s not going to hit until python 4 anyways (the version after 3.9), so what’s the big deal?
All you downvoting hating mf'ers are really coding in the wrong language. Y'all need to grasp the concept of `duck typing`. "Oh BuT iT hElPs Me FiGuRe OuT ThE TyPeS" `without any enforcement or guarantee that that's what's passed at runtime`. Y'all need to switch to a statically typed language.
I did have an async variable I used as a rotor parameter. They also totally broke numpy, which broke my package. I forget exactly how.
My company is moving from 2.6 to 2.7! Yay!
no more updates. and you better download your dependencies, just in case pypi “pledges” to stop hosting py2 packages
You have some unnecessary parentheses there pal
RHEL 8 was [officially released a few weeks ago. ](https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2019/05/07/red-hat-enterprise-linux-8-now-generally-available/) CentOS 8 will not be far behind.
It really depends what a “breaking change” is. If it’s something that might require a simple one-off step, like recompiling all C-based extensions, then I don’t think it would be much of a burden. It doesn’t even have to be “breaking” to earn a major number, it just has to be a “major change”, that may or may not impact backward-compatibility. One big change I think would be worth the major-release bump, is the GILectomy, should it ever come to pass. Most large orgs would gladly suffer a bit of pain if it meant a massive performance gain. Or something crazy like swallowing numpy/scipy in stdlib. Or it might be something symbolic like overcoming the bin/python vs bin/python3 split, mandating that python4 should finally be aliased to bin/python. Important change for ops people, not necessarily for developers. Py3 was a painful move, py4 doesn’t need to be; I think there is value in keeping things simple and bump the version reasonably often, rather than forcing developers to remember the differences between 3.38 and 3.32...
Are you sure about that? I just did the exact same thing and ended up with both `a` and `b` being `[[], [1, 2, 3], [], []]`.

Hmm, thanks for the tip! I've use `futurize --stage1` a fair bit but never really liked the second stage... though just getting syntax-compatible with Python 3 allows many more tools to work. I'll try modernize :-)
It's because `list.__iadd__` is basically implemented as def __iadd__(self, other): self.extend(other) return self
I never really use python but was writing some simple script in it to automate some task and found that changing from one of these to the other made something go from not working to working. I wish I could remember what it was. Really weirded me out and I wanted to know why but I had better things to do.
It’s fine, we will all have 14 days (during the holidays) to update our code base.
I mean splitting up a list of 700+ items to 10 workers using threadpoolexecutor
Python 4 is already mentioned in the timelines for many of the changes. But not to worry, it will be much less of an issue migrating from 3-&gt;4 than it was from 2-&gt;3.
Numpy isn't a core library.
Being that there were 0 dull or unnecessary moments in your video, I completely disagree with u/desertfish_. That person clearly did not even watch the video, else they would have known what a zonk is.
print “yay!”
Ah, good point, I forgot concurrent.futures is 3-only...
do you know about magic wormhole? [https://magic-wormhole.readthedocs.io/](https://magic-wormhole.readthedocs.io/)
😂 fair enough thank you
What dictionary change in 3.5 are you taking about? The only dictionary change I am aware of was ordering which came in 3.6 or 3.7, and wasn't a defined behavior previously. As for these removals being delayed until 4.0, I think most people would accept that, but I'm not aware of any discussions of when 4.0 might be released.
Oh right okay, but can’t flask use like standard SQL as well? Since that’s more robust compared to sqlite for example? Thank you much
Ah cheers, good to hear!
I was surprised to learn that CentOS 7 still uses Python 2.7 as its default.
That’s what I was thinking
Yeah I was thinking this could be a down sight to high activity count but hopefully not
Ah great thank you man
I was testing under Python 3.7.2, maybe it is different for Python 2?
Look into using something like pyinstaller to make a release as a standalone executable. Then you don't have to worry about which folder the script is run from.
