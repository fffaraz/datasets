And make sure the project is actually maintained. May be disappointing when there's no one around to review and merge pull request.
Always check the official documentation, specially for a subject like this. [This](https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#using-python-on-windows) is the main Python on Windows chapter. And [this](https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#python-launcher-for-windows) is the part you need to read. So, if you are using a relatively current Python 3.6 installer, you'll get the Python Launcher bundled. Good luck.
I'd like to push it to Github and make a nice Jupyter notebook out of it! The dataset itself was quite large (and took about 45m to tokenize and filter for stopwords on my machine), so I already posted a [pickled set of tokenized tweets](https://github.com/mcataford/DataAnalysis/tree/master/NBCTweets) produced from the raw data! It clocks in at about 3M tokens, although I'm sure some more processing could be done.

Predicting what? How? What sort of help are you looking for? Is your project open source? If it's proprietary, are you expecting to make money off it?
Sadly, I focused primary on finishing this Windows version, since I found notify. On the other hand, multiplatform library would be amazing to have. I will think about it.

Please help us to help you. What "code isn't implemented in the package"? What error is raised? Please show your code and the complete traceback that you get.
It is just a university project.
Okay, cool. Thanks for sharing.
Check out CodeTriage:)
Yep, it also is easiest to find an area to improve in something you use frequently.
Thanks! Do they work well in development? ie, save a jsx file and changes appear after a reload?
That sounds positively crazy dude, I like it.
Why reverse engineer it instead of using SWIG?
I've run an open source project for 6.5 years. Just offer to help with something. Offer to fix some bugs, ask if they'd want some cool new feature that you're interested in. What you need to find out is what are you interested in? Do you want to work on it for 2+ years?
Yeah this is exactly what the problem was. Under the hood the multiprocessing library spins up multiple versions of the same script so it has access to the same functions, then pickles arguments and return values back and forth. Since this wasn't ensuring that it was executing the main logic only once it was essentially choking and dying. 
Hettinger has suggested adding `__doc__` strings to a project you're already familiar with. It _requires_ the contributor have an understanding the module's history and functionality; often a harder exercise than writing the module the first time around was.

This question is coming up more and more in developer forums - and *really* means "I'm unemployed and hoping to gain an Internet reputation by having a public record of contributions so I can add this to my CV". The motivation is terrible; but perhaps in *this* case you genuinely appreciate work others have done and want to give back to the world in some way. Well - here's some ways you can contribute: * recycle * do some volunteering of your time in your local community * start a free blog somewhere and document problems *you've* solved * download the source code to a project you actually use - study the code - and if you have something meaningful to add then consider submitting a patch to the developer e-mail list * visit sites like sourceforge or github - create an account - watch some projects you enjoy - and view the bug reports - see if there are any bugs you can solve Whatever you do - don't spray and pray - submit code changes you don't fully understand that could potentially *introduce* new bugs or make the program worse in some way (additional unrelated features, for example). Start by checking your motivation, and then ask yourself - am I helping or hindering with what I'm about to do?

IronPython allows you to write Python 2.7 code that can use .NET libraries.
Instead of messing with `sys.path` in https://github.com/2legal2/.scripts/blob/dev/src/pactools create a package and use relative import for the other module. Or just embed the dict within your script.

Ironpython is a completely different implementation of the python language specification. Written on top of the .net CLR. It can, therefore, run any place that .net can, and can take advantage of the .net forms libraries, security libraries etc etc. It also has no GIL iirc. Python3: the official cpython implementation of python spec. I don't think ironpython implements the version 3 language spec yet, hence the version number, but happy to be proven wrong, not used ironpython in years. 
Thanks!

I already knew of windows 10 toast, but this seems better, and if you can make this cross-platform, this will definitely be the goto notification library. I'd change the name though, it isn't very intuitive, thus hard to find on pypi.

Microsoft produces a platform they call ".NET". It consists of a language-agnostic virtual machine and a set of base libraries. Microsoft's own programming languages, like C#, compile to bytecode which runs on that virtual machine. The Python implementation you're used to working with is called CPython, which includes its own virtual machine that runs its own bytecode; CPython compiles Python source code to bytecode for the CPython virtual machine. IronPython is an implementation of Python which compiles to bytecode for the .NET Common Language Runtime (its virtual machine), allowing Python to execute on that virtual machine, and access all the libraries available on the .NET platform. A similar effort, Jython, exists to provide an implementation of Python running on the Java Virtual Machine.
Python absolutely spoils us. I can't stand any other language now.

The scope of seq would be better, but I would argue that it would be *better* because your "static variables" live in a well defined, normal, pythonic scope. Outside of seq, everything is exactly the same.
From my experience with Linux OS's, installing Python 3 doesn't screw up the OS you just have to use commands like python3 or pip3.6 as python and pip will be registered for Python 2. Unless there's something weird with Ubuntu (which is entirely likely) I don't see why installing 3 would screw up the OS.
Add [this PPA](https://launchpad.net/~deadsnakes/+archive/ubuntu/ppa) and install `python3.6`. Then you'll be able to run it with `python3.6` - it doesn't replace the system Python 2 (or Python 3, for that matter) install.
You cannot use a single global multiple times, you can create as many class instances or functions as you like without having a problem.
I'm learning python now so I can do something like this, how is your project going?
Hey there tell more about it. Maybe we can help out. Particularly I am interested in helping 
Wouldn’t the projects in need of contributors be the ones that are *not* trending?
Hey! Well the code does need some tidying up, Take a look it at on Github and see how you think you could improve it. I have tried to comment as much of the code as I can.
Ok, i am all set and i made a small guide to this: https://github.com/seospace/HTTP200-ASAP
for scientific work you need "random" numbers so that your simulations aren't biased. but you don't care if they're unpredictable to others (in fact, you'd often publish the random seed so others can reproduce your results exactly).
If I remember, Kenneth Reitz recently asked for more contributors to the amazing [Pipenv](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv) project.
You could run py3 in a container (like Docker).
Or jump into the deep end and fork an abandoned project. You might learn something from understanding the existing code and get applause from people who still use it and would like to contribute but don't have the time to fully maintain it.
You can install python 3.6 without issues. This a guide I wrote for myself, check it out: http://blog.sentyaev.net/2017/05/30/install-python-in-ubuntu.html

can this be modified to support 'infinite' sequence?
The iterate generates an infinite sequence, the take just returns the first 35 numbers.
Wow that looks awesome, I was worried cause I heard the pipfile progress had slowed
Multi platform could wrap the platform-specific with a simple facade, assuming it had a reliable way to discern which of the underlying implementations was appropriate / functional.
Ive pushed small guide to help others: https://github.com/seospace/HTTP200-ASAP Thank you a lot for your recommendation.
If a global variable is used how do I get multiple counters?
OP's method doesn't allow multiple counters.
As long as it's good code I don't care.
This is just a 1,000 line function. I would not expect many contributors.
It's annoying when people don't do the bare minimum googling when they come up against a term they don't recognise.
It's too hard to find the git homepage for some people that they have to downvote this.
Would something like https://novemberfive.co/blog/opensource-pypi-package-repository-tutorial/ work?
I think the point is that its probably _not_ going to be good or even well thought out code.
You want to use Anaconda. I personally use Miniconda for all my Python endeavors. You can install whatever version of Python you want on any machine you want, and it doesn't mess with your operating system at all. You don't even need root access. You can create separate environments just like with virtualenv, and move between environments using `conda activate my_env`. I'll emphasize again that you really, really don't want to use your system Python. Virtualenv isn't compartmentalized enough, i.e I've had a `virtualenv`die when `apt upgrade` upgraded Python 2.7.x to 2.7.x+1.
Hmm... I'm afraid we all still need more info. A start would be telling us what part you need help in so we can at least point you in the right direction. What's the current progress in the project? Has it even been started? Best to break down the tasks and tackle them one at a time. I highly doubt anyone would be willing to just write your whole project for you. To start with, trawl through github and find something similar you can at least learn of from.
git clone -&gt; pull request
and what scientific work id that that can't just work with a number generated by a deterministic random generator? 
I agree. This seems like something worth filing a bug for.
none that I know of, but PRNGs vary in quality and there are definitely some which are too poor to be used, see for example https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2992609/
[Pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas) can always use help. They’ve over 2,200 open issues and there’s plenty to learn from. 
Documentation -- almost all projects could use some documentation love. Be it writing better tutorials in sphinx, or just going through and cleaning up and expanding docstrings, or just going through and making sure any error messages are informative and useful to new users, it is all *incredibly* useful. What is more in a lot of cases it is hard for core maintainers to do some of this: they are so deep in the package that existing terse documentation can look fine to them. I know I have a terrible time writing good new-user-friendly docs for my projects. So pick a project you like and use a bit and go through the documentation and find things you can make clearer, or explain better. I *love* getting documentation pull requests. They are usually easy to review and incredibly helpful.
I'm just learning python which is a lot of work. I'm coming from java and lisp so this will be fun

That appears to largely perform the same tasks as our current tool but solves the credential issue in a way I think we wouldn’t want to go for. Our builds are done through CircleCI and so we’d need to whitelist AWS IPs for the whitelist option - far too broad - or we’d need to trust our URLs are secret - which if we could then we could trust our credentials are secret. Alternatively, am I going about this from an entirely wrong direction? Are others building Docker images with private packages in some wildly different way?

I think it's more common place to put scraper identification information into the User-Agent string of the GET request itself.
Ok fine I'll do a thing. Here goes, taking inspiration from the imported function random.sample. ``` from random import sample def threeplacement_sample(choices, k): last_three = [None, None, None] i = 0 while i &lt; k: [current] = sample(set(choices) - set(last_three), 1) yield current last_three = last_three[1:] + [current] i += 1 print(' '.join(str(item) for item in threeplacement_sample(range(1,11), 35))) ``` Looking at it now you'd be right if you didn't think it should be given to a beginner, but neither would I tell a beginner to make a function with static variables. It's simply a surprising pattern for python and goes back to my original point that the tutorial isn't very pythonic, despite being well executed. Choosing to do this with a function specifically is an arbitrary constraint in python as its just another callable, and you have all kinds of paradigms at your disposal to manage state.
I thought that User-Agent strings had to be pretty specifically formatted and have pretty specific content.
I'm the author of [migra](migra, a schema comparison/diff tool for postgres). It's been a one man effort so far and I'd love some other contributors. If you're interested, get in touch. Lots of easy little bugfixes/enhancements to get started with, or new features to work on if you're looking for something weightier. Documentation could be a lot better, if you're into that. I'm going to add a contributor guide to make this a bit easier. But in the meantime, don't be afraid to just find an issue on the github page and jump in! Happy to answer any questions and talk you through the process.
If you are still of that opinion when you've read the snippet, please get back to me. The last thing I want to do is have something that's intended as a courtesy end up causing problems.
Reddit posts
Sqlite3 offers an actual diff of rows. Does postgres have any potential for that?
Functionality for diffing the table contents too would be great, but I'm focussed on schema comparison only, at least at the moment, as it's a tool primarily built for generating migration scripts. I would love to build this functionality also, but simply don't have the time to work on this and the schema features too.

When you've assisted in the development effort.
Head over there if you like if you don't mind advice that is sometimes poor or even plain downright wrong. There are plenty of vastly superior resources available, including the main python mailing list or the tutor mailing list. You can find both of them at [python mailing lists](https://www.python.org/community/lists/).
&gt; I really should file a bug report for it. It should be trivial to fix, and I don't think Python is particularly obsessed with "optimizing for the common case" to the extent of removing those kinds of safeguards I'd have though a bug report well worth while. I don't completely understand the second sentence so could you clarify it please, thanks.
&gt; but a six.compat.range would act just like python3s range in python2 and 3. I'm not aware of a `six.compat`, help for `six` states that it's only submodule is `moves`. Anyhow I think `six` just plays with the names `range` and `xrange`, it doesn't provide any code, whereas it actually provides code for (say) the `itertools module` to cover differences between 2 and 3.

Because I believe that alembic's approach to database migrations isn't the right one. Instead of keeping a long sequence of migration files with version numbers, it's better to just directly compare your current schema with your intended schema. This is also a more generalized tool than alembic. Alembic is a migration tool for webapps, migra is just a diff tool, rather than a tool that imposes a particular workflow on you. I did a talk about this in more detail at the most recent PostgresOpen, if you're interested: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xr498W8oMRo

This is a cool idea for a project. Would the approach be to compare image hashes for uniqueness?
[http://up-for-grabs.net/](http://up-for-grabs.net/) is a container of opens source projects with open issues. Everything listed here have at least one easy issue you can grab and contribute to. Many of them have more challenging issues to solve. Biggest help in every project is writing examples/documentation/docstrings.. Those are the most overlooked parts of a project and writing those is the best/fastest way to get familiar with the project so you can write good code later.. 
So you defined the function (and yes, you’re right - it’s missing the ‘:’ ) but where is the body of the function that actually calculates the average? 
Not wildly different, but what we did was using multi-stage build, first installing the necessary built tools, then `pip` or `pipenv install git+https://private/repo.git`, then run `setup.py`. CI would then need to be able to authenticate to Git server, but, that's mandatory anyways.

Now some of that stuff is written in the documentation making it even easier to contribute.

Raymond Hettinger has a lot of really good videos, some of which are about code style: - [Beyond PEP8](https://youtu.be/wf-BqAjZb8M) - [Transforming Code into Beautiful, Idiomatic Python](https://youtu.be/OSGv2VnC0go) In addition, try reading standard library code- you can easily find it by clicking the "Source" link at the top of most of the official modules' documentation. 
sounds something similar to this :https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43184887/dll-load-failed-error-when-importing-cv2 I recommend googling things before posting, since odds are you are not the first person to come across a problem. if you do not find the solution, r/learnpython or /r/learnprogramming would probably be more helpful. Keep on trying!

That's a problem every project has, whether it's a fork or not. And it's mostly solved by search engines and social websites like reddit.
That looks pretty badass! Will keep my eyes on that one 
https://github.com/multani/sonata - Sonata is written using the Python programming language and uses the GTK 3 toolkit. Sonata started as a fork of the Pygmy project and is licensed under the GPLv3 or later. Thanks to Andrew Conkling et al, for all their hard work on Pygmy! The maintainer says: "I (@multani) don't use Sonata much anymore and as a consequence, I've been very slow to answer even to the few bugs reported and pull requests from external contributors. If you are still interested in Sonata and would like to see it alive again, please contact me by email to see what we can do!" It's a great little mpd player, I've used it for a long time. My python skills are nowhere near good enough to contribute, but bugs and ui are more my thing.
Yes, next step would be store all the metadata you collect in a DB for saved images and check against the dB instead of rehashing everything all the time, sqlite and a orm. Third step turn into a website and accept uploads over the network

I think your next step is to set a break point at this line: &gt; fetch_as_csv(max_length) then single step until the program hangs. That will tell you where it's hanging and give you some idea of what's going on.

You removed it? That is a bad idea, OSXhas lots of things that use python 2 that won’t work with 3 (which is why they haven’t upgraded) The best way to use it is in a virtual environment in your user folder using something like Anaconda so you don’t disturb the system install/packages 
Can't believe no one has mentioned beeware: https://pybee.org/ Here's a talk they did on getting native apps for iOS and Android written in pure Python in a PyCon 2016 talk: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqdpK9KjGgQ I believe they have a 2018 talk coming up as well.
Thank you. Very user-friendly software.
Thanks. Unfortunately all I got were error messages like this: WARNING: failed to copy flags of /System/Library/Frameworks/Tcl.framework/Versions/8.5/Resources/Scripts/msgs/ in other words I have problems with all the files on this path
&gt; I think the point is that its probably not going to be good or even well thought out code. Why exactly? I always code the same, no matter if it's a project work work I don't enjoy, or a personal project that I'm having fun with. Do you write crap code sometimes?
Installed it, thank you. Now how do I use it?
The thing is i want to use python only.
&gt; Python.NET I think this refers to an entirely different thing: https://pythonnet.github.io/ It's not related to or usable by IronPython. So if you have to use IronPython it's unfortunately of no use to you. I think this is how you would install numpy with IronPython: `ipy -m ensurepip`, `ipy -m pip install numpy` but it fails.

If you don't want to add things to the system don't add PPAs or install packages. I would highly recommend pyenv and pyenv-virtualenv. It's one of the best ways to run system level interpreter selection without breaking existing dependencies and have pyenv available as a wrapper as well. https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-virtualenv
Thank you all for the suggestions !!!

That's a function you've written. You need to single step into it and see which library call is hanging.

Excellent thank you. 
You should have bumped the major version number since there are backwards incompatible changes.
I love this module! Great work! Beware of a Unicode-related regression in numpy 1.14 - Deep in the code for einsum functions, a type error will be raised. Was tripping up conversions to xyz colorspace. Reverting to numpy 1.13 seemed to fix the problem. 
Remove the bare `except:` from `is_occupied` as they are a complete no-go in Python, see e.g. [No exception type(s) specified](https://docs.quantifiedcode.com/python-anti-patterns/correctness/no_exception_type_specified.html). Run the code again and with any luck you'll get a lovely traceback telling you exactly what the problem is.

I just contributed to my first open source project a few weeks ago. It was Microsoft's VS Code (not python I know). But I didn't really know how to start either. But quickly this is what I did. 1. Find a project you like or know about. Doesn't have to be big. 2. Make sure you can build and run from source. 3. look at their open issues and find one that is "easy". A simple bug fix. Most projects will organize these with labels like "need help" or "good first issue" 4. Figure out where in the code base to make the changes, running a debugger with a couple of breakpoints helped me pinpoint were to make the changes 5. make sure the current tests setup in the project still pass and send your PR. 
Well at least I know others are in the same situation. Thanks!
Why?
What OS and what version of python are you using? 
I guess that's mainly relevant for time critical code, right? For 99% of my code I don't think an extra string interpolation would hurt me.
Hitting ctrl-c within a hanging process doesn't trace back to the error causing that process, it only gives a KeyboardInterrupt error. Sorry.
Please don't.
That is not executable as-is -- it does not reproduce the error you claimed to get. It doesn't import any `discord` module, let alone specify what version of that module you're using. Fix that first. You should always reduce an example to the smallest piece of code which reproduces the problem. Sometimes that exercise makes the problem reveal itself to you. If not, then share that _smallest piece of code that reproduces the problem_ along with _your expectations_ compared to _your observations_. For example; $ python3.6 -m venv discordenv $ source discordenv/bin/activate $ python -m pip install discord $ python &gt;&gt;&gt; import discord &gt;&gt;&gt; discord.Embed() Expected: &lt;discord.embeds.Embed object at 0x104199828&gt; Observed: Traceback (most recent call last): File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt; AttributeError: module 'discord' has no attribute 'Embed' And then you would be in a position to express _why_ you have those expectations. Eg, is `discord` is a module? &gt;&gt;&gt; type(discord) &lt;class 'module'&gt; .. and does it have an attribute `Embed`? &gt;&gt;&gt; 'Embed' in dir(discord) True 
You're very right in this, bare excepts are non-pythonic... but I need it because I think it's the only way of getting the unreported status code.

That rule (and it's more of a guideline) doesn't apply on pre v1.x releases. 
So take a look at the python file mentioned with: ``` cat /Users/ethan/Documents/text\ analytics.py ``` I'm guessing that it has something about getting input. Then for your python path, take a look at the contents of these files ``` ~/.bashrc ~/.bash_profile ``` For your python path check it with this ``` printing | grep PYTHONPATH ``` Somewhere that file is getting called, it should be spelled out somewhere there.
How are you launching IDLE (what you're running in your screenshot) Also these questions belong in /r/LearnPython for future reference.
Is 3.5 the system python? If so you need to install pip from the repos. The package is probably called `python3-pip`. Once pip is installed you can install nltk with this command: sudo pip3 install nltk Note that when using python3, you have to use the command `pip3`, not `pip`.
Is this a 3D drawing/visual graphic library? I've been looking for something a bit easier to use than PyOpenGL, but also a bit more complex than turtle...
I HIGHLY recomend using a virtualenv. Once i did it once, it made my life easier. virtualenv &lt;nameofenv&gt; source &lt;nameofenv&gt;/bin/activate pip3 install nltk
First of all, the post is very hard to read, please check out this formatting: sorted(num_friends_by_id, key = lambda (user_id, num_friends): num_friends, reverse = True) Second, `key` should be a function that takes one argument, a single element from your iterable, not two. I have no clue what num_friends_by_id is ("num" makes me think it's an integer but since you're sorting it I guess it's an iterable), but I'm guessing what you want is something like `key=lambda friend: friend.num_friends`.

But pandas is not for bigdata :) 
hey! i found a quick intro https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sea2K4AuPOk but i haven't found a good tutorial series or something since it's very new. So you'll have to stick to the documentation only :(
&gt; Note that when using python3, you have to use the command pip3, not pip. Thanks, I realized that was my problem. So I have pip, but I'm not connected to the internet. Do I need to download nltk from somewhere and put it on a disk?
Don't install external things to the system python with pip. That can break your os. Don't run pip as root. Use `pip3 install nltk` inside a virtual environment, or `pip3 install --user nltk` to at least quarantine any side-effects to your own user.
I use it to strip data sources to the relevent parts before importing it to my databases
I'm not familiar with installing NLTK this way, but, you'll also need to download the corpus' and some other parts of NLTK by running the downloader from within NLTK.
I recommend dash because this is the python sub and we'll, im partial with python. And dash imo is a very good solution to run python on web.
[virtualenvwrapper](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is even better (in my opinion). For Python 3: $ mkvirtualenv -p `which python3` &lt;envname&gt; $ pip install nltk and when you want to use this virtualenv again: $ workon &lt;envname&gt;
https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Rendered_Spectrum.pn This image demonstrates a great method to visualize colors beyond the gamut of the display. The brain seems to compensate for the added grey and makes the colors of the entire spectrum seem vibrant and with correct hue. I would really like to see a rendering mode in the colour.plotting subpackage that implements this. Perhaps it should even be the default. Another interesting mode would be to apply this only to colors outside the sRGB triangle and keep any color that can be represented on the screen as-is. 
Would it be possible to do all of this on a computer that has internet and somehow identify all of the new files and copy them to the other computer?

Maybe, but it could turn into a lot of trips to the place with the internet. I'm not a Python expert by any stretch, but it looks like you'd have to copy files from /usr/local/lib/pythonX.Y/dist-packges from one machine to another (Assuming your environment is set up the same way mine is, and replace X.Y with the version number) Both your internet-connected computer and your development computer will need the same versions of Python, and similar environments... but, with any kind of development, you'll end up needing "just one more" module every few weeks when you're working on something. It's not going to be painless to do what you're trying to do. Lots of little frustrations will crop up along the way.
We are still in pre-stable mode and this is discussed as per this issue: https://github.com/colour-science/colour/issues/133
Yes, we had many issues with 1.14, even the array printing changed: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/10369 And the Einsum issue you described affected Colour indeed: https://github.com/colour-science/colour/issues/380
We had an interesting discussion going about that a few years ago: https://github.com/colour-science/colour/issues/191
[pylint](https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint) is used by so many people, but it has surprisingly few contributors. It is in dire need of the code being cleaned up as well. For a linter, it's code quality is surprisingly poor... It also has an AST parsing backend, [astroid](https://github.com/PyCQA/astroid), that only a subset of the pylint developers work on regularly. The user base is not huge but [sphinx-autoapi](https://github.com/rtfd/sphinx-autoapi) is a project that is aiming to provide autodoc style documentation generation, but by using static analysis instead of loading the Python modules.

I tested a proper User-Agent string in the requests.get() request on a website whose contact person I'm in communication with, and he should be able to get the devs to tell him if there were any issues. I'm also looking into setting up my own local server for testing as suggested by someone else here, but I need to finid out whether the software will work on my Win 10 Home, which does not have server hosting capability.
I do whenever I think I can write something helpful. I've also forked, upgraded, and pull requested a few things here and there. Unfortunately I'm not much of a programmer and even less of a writer so while I can supply helpful stuff for smaller projects large ones are well beyond the scope of what I have the skills to accurately contribute to.

Are you looking to build an actual storage engine (like MySQL/PostgreSQL/etc) or a website that users can access a database through? If it's the former, you probably want C++. If it's the latter, Python is great, and you might want to look into Django if your database is complicated.

Tried that and it didn't work. 
And Anaconda is now included in the latest update to VS 2017. Be careful with that; when the VS 2017 update was installed where I work, it uninstalled the standalone Python 3.6 we had been using. (The guy installing it says he just used the default options, so there's hopefully a way to avoid this. He also didn't tell anyone he was installing it.) To reduce exposure to directory attacks, the reporting was called using the full path to python.exe, so this broke all our python-based reporting. Fortunately for us our production reports use no custom libraries and everything we need was included in the Anaconda version, so getting the reporting back up simply involved mapping in the new path. Still, that was a lively half hour on a Friday afternoon.

You tried what, exactly? Then what, exactly, happened? You've provided none of the code you wrote nor any description of the outcome. You need to provide a lot more detail.
Sorry if I reply too late. There is still no any traceback... Apparently the code is logically right but very very very costly and needs serious optimization... So much so, I had to remove the whole class and am rewriting at the moment. :)
It's pretty good in my opinion. The editor is smooth, and autocomplete works out of the box. I would still use PyCharm for large programs though.
Please read [How To Ask Questions The Smart Way](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html) and [The SSCCE - Short, Self Contained, Correct (Compilable), Example](http://sscce.org/) and try again, thank you in anticipation.
Ok. here's the code I used to read particular rows from a file... import csv with open('import.csv', 'r') as csv_file: reader = csv.DictReader(csv_file) for row in reader: print(row['Decision'], row['EMAIL_ADDR'], row['ACAD_PLAN']) Now I would like to write these rows and data in the columns to a new csv. I'm a little confused. btw: Thank you for your reply.
In that case please write some tests for your code as I get the impression that you currently have nothing. You might like to take a look at [Getting Started with Mocking in Python](https://semaphoreci.com/community/tutorials/getting-started-with-mocking-in-python) as this could help with your http connection testing.

Yup. Been my default editor / IDE for over a year. The speed of improvement is phenomenal. There used to be a lot of rough edges, but it was always useable. Now I can count the number of things that need fixing on one hand, and they keep adding cool extras. Then I remember that it’s an Electron/TypeScript app and mind melts into a puddle on the floor.
Has Spyder improved in the last year or so? I always wanted to like it, but it never quite worked well enough in my opinion. Then I found VSCode and I haven’t wanted to try anything else.
The documentation has been entirely re-written! https://github.com/colour-science/colour/blob/v0.3.11/colour.readthedocs.io Or not...
Unfortunately, we had a very tight deadline (matter of fact, it ends in 4 days) and I am the only one involved in the project, writing a test suite didn't seem to be an option to me. Thank you million times, friend! BTW, it was a good read!

Woot!
Does it have the ability to run code interactively like jupyter notebooks?
Also it’s included by reference not by value. Isn’t installed until you ask for it. 
In that case I'd look for another job as I can't stand the clink of the spurs as I'm trying to concentrate, YMMV.
Wasn't a dig really, just frustration at my own governments sly tactics on unemployment figures lol.
No
I have already found another job... Starting early the next month.
If you have a computer with the same os and version of python as the target machine, then you should be able to run `pip3 wheel nltk` and it will produce some wheel files (.whl). You should then be able to copy these wheels to your target machine and use pip to install them. In case you didn't see my other post, don't use `sudo` with pip.
No probably not, helping with docs makes sure I better understand a piece of software. If I'm reasonable confidant my understanding is right and it gets the job done it's better than no documentation at all.
I imagine there was some deal done with microsoft. PyCharm's new scientific mode is pretty sweet, though, maybe better for matlab refugees than VS code would be.
Vscode, no. But anacondas packaging is basically the corner stone of scientific computing python.
The pycharm feature set can't be beat. But it's So. Damn. Slow. I actually end up using Visual Studio Code most of the time. 
Assuming you already have it in a pandas dataframe, you could use the above suggestion of plotting and looking at it visually with dataframe_name.data_of_interest.hist() for a histogram, and if you want to look at the pdf then dataframe_name.data_of_interest.plot.density(). 
But does it have buns, son? Other wise I don't want it.
https://github.com/python-mode/python-mode This library is amazing.. but we need more contributors so we can make if flourish and update with the latest improvements
PyCharm is pretty awesome.
Yikes, didn't notice you were still pre release actually. So many users, and around for years. 
do you have your code on nfs or something? I have a pretty big code base and PyCharm spins like a top for me.
Yes - there is a [juypter extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=donjayamanne.jupyter) :) You can also try out [my extension](https://github.com/almenon/arepl-vscode) which has a real-time python scratchpad. [Demo gif](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Almenon/AREPL-vscode/master/example.gif)
Can vs code do remote interpreters such as vagrant?
I use pycharm with remote interpreters (vagrant) and its “ok.”
I'm pretty pissed off. I spent my weekend doing this!
That's sad. I hope you find a better opportunity soon :)
This is the internet, not the smartphone net. Seriously tho my smartphone is shite, it's calendar is worse, I dont use a data tariff, and I dont take it everywhere. So theres' that.
Anaconda has stopped supporting the development of Spyder a while back.. :( https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/wiki/Anaconda-stopped-funding-Spyder I would have preferred neovim/vim
A very good tutorial on the topic: https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world
In the first example, did you mean to append to res? Because you've re-assigned to it instead. /r/learnpython would be a more appropriate place.
PyCharm gives me less creeps than potential triple E. But, in terms of quality, to me they are equally bad: a kind of programming based on sales/marketing, driven by the desire to capture more noobs and by doing so to disallow good editors for more experienced users.
Nah. I use spyder pretty frequently, and I don't know why.
Thanks for the quick reply. Still not explained why generator assignment to `for` loop variable produces different result then inside of list comprehension, ie. why for p in [e1(), e2(), e3()]: res = [x+[y] for x in res for y in p] is not equivalent to for p in [e1, e2, e3]: res = [x+[y] for x in res for y in p()] 
if by competitor you mean a million miles ahead.
What?
It's simple, it's all about when you are calling the functions (with `()`). In your version, you are only calling the functions `e1(), e2(), e3()` a total of once each. My bigger question is always, why not use the standard library? I would understand if it's just homework but otherwise, using `itertools.product` seems like a better idea. Also, if you aren't stuck to the idea of returning a list of lists, you could just use `list(product(range(1, 4), 'abc', (False, True)))` which would return a list of tuples. 
Your username really suits you. I served up an opportunity for you to back up your request and help your cause, but your response was so bitter! Why are you so angry?
What the hell are you talking about?
Huh, my apologies. I did forgot, in python generators become exhausted once for all. Unlike ruby enumerators. *shame* 
I had always used Pycharm, but decided to give VSCode a try for a while. Unfortunately, I couldn’t figure out how to set up an interactive console (select code in the editor then cmd-enter to run). I think at best I managed to run specific lines, but it broke for multiline selections. Also, the linter couldn’t understand f strings. It’s a shame, because it’s really an amazing editor, but Pycharm is a very solid IDE with tons of features out of the box. But if anyone can point out how to fix the above, I’d gladly go back to VSCode, for small projects at least. 
That's a fairly inefficient way to get the python path unfortunately. Many things can modify it. Best way is `print(sys.path)` to know what it is at a given point in time. 
PyCharm os awesome! I have used it a long time. Last week I give a try to neovim + deoplete + pudb and I AM loving it. PyCharm was consuming so much memory =[
What does the word “steady” mean in this context?
I move between Sublime, Atom and VSCode for a mix of language (mostly Ruby, Python, JS and C#) and VSCode is my preferred editor. My reasons: - cross-platform - open-source and aggressively maintained - no single language bias (not Python or Ruby or JS centric - Solid VC integration - All the modern editor must-haves (multi-cursor, syntax highlighting, persistent editor, debug support, fast start-up, large extension library, etc.) - Solid UI defaults that work for me Biggest con is it can’t handle 400MB files as easily as Sublime.
Every time I try VS, it just feels clunky
Can I ask what you use for your code?
Nope. Locally. Thing's okay if I'm just doing simple editing. Soon as I'm doing anything interesting it craps itself completely. I love their stuff. I subscribe to their full product suite. But holy crap is it slow as a dog.
That's only in the professional edition, though, right? I don't think community has scientific mode. 
I think pygame might be the right way to control the display and render yout text. Maybe some adaptation applied to this "Pygame Slideshow" program would work? https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/144024/pygame-slideshow
You didn't ask them for anything upfront?
 #!/usr/bin/env python import getpass import copy if __name__ == "__main__": x = getpass.getpass("Password: ") y = copy.copy(x) assert x == y assert x is not y
Thanks! I'm glad you like it :)
Yes, I always do this. But this was a toy project to measure my skills. 
This was a toy project they made me do to measure my skills. 
This "weekend project" to get hired bullshit is basically how I got started writing open source. After an experience similar to yours I figured if I was going to work for free in order to score an interview it should at least on a project that belonged to me, it should be something interesting and should be something I could show to lots of companies. It was actually pretty effective at skipping this type of thing. Moreover, it provided a useful filter: "no, we didn't read your code now do our project if you want a job" were basically advertising themselves as a combination of incompetent and entitled.
Look to the sidebar for information on properly formatting your code so that it's readable. Also check your parenthesis.
I love it. It also doesn’t take ages to open (looking at you atom)
I’d break it down a bit, you really have two independent tasks: 1. Get a webpage as a string (you can use requests to do this, if you want the easy way) 2. Check if the desired string is *in* the downloaded string (a standard python problem, I gave you a hint here for the quick and easy way to do the check, though there are others).
this free chapter might help https://automatetheboringstuff.com/chapter11/
Awesome, thanks for the advice! I'm going to try start fixing bugs in open source projects.
The company had bad reputation on Glassdoor. Should I leave a bad review? 
It's harder if you're going for a job, which OP was. My solution is to host it myself, and I don't hand over git/ssh/ftp access until the deal goes through. If they want to see the source, I send them watermarked images - takes about a minute or so with some imagemagick scripts I have lying around.
need a quant as well for risk models
Absolutely
Every time.
Thank you. That sounds like exactly what I'm looking for.
we did quant analysis system for stock trend predictions, back in 2014 for an internal project for a New York based client, a grp of traders. we did social network analysis plus stock trend predictions algorithm to determine downtrend and uptrend of each symbol and alert user accordingly . 
Where did you get that link? This is the documentation location: http://colour.readthedocs.io/en/develop/
Because nothing else in life gives them a thrill?
If you indent with four spaces, this will format: def caesar(s, k): upcased = s.upper() alphabet = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ' n = 26 newstring = '' for i in range(len(s)): if upcased[i] in alphabet: newstring += alphabet[(alphabet.find(upcased[i]) + k) % n] else: newstring += upcased[i] return newstring def vigenere(s, key): alphabet = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ' n = 26 answer = "" for i in range(len(s)): answer += (caesar(s[i], alphabet.find(key[i % len(s)])) return answer Also /r/learnpython
Of course.
I would look at pyqt5
Please do.
VSCode is open source? No? Maybe because it's simpler. Not a bad choice , i love using VSCode. 
Apparently there is a Python 3 branch of IronPython that I was unaware of. Either you're using that or there's a "from __future__ import print_function" up top.
Someone please put ween into this model
This comes with LTS I presume. 
Note for /u/tractortractor - this, and similar suggestions, fall under "Other reasons that may stand out as reason for contributing to a project": Mentoring! The experience of contributing to a project can be wildly different depending on the attitude and availability of project maintainers, and whether they're invested in *you improving as a person &amp; programmer* or just *getting a patch for that thing*. The former is way more rewarding - and much easier! - and lists like up-for-grabs will try to ensure you get that option.
Gearing up for another large patch to my first Python app. Y'all have helped with this a lot in the past so please do leave any feedback you have! (check out the readme below) :) https://github.com/pmaji/crypto-whale-whatching-app
You sure? I would love to start using it again if it was, but https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/features/editions_comparison_matrix.html
you give them the whole source and not just code snippets? 
Sent you PM.
In your README you link to non-existing page Please take a look at the link below for more information: https://channels.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started.html#running-with-channels
A poll application where you have a poll object containing option objects won't be as straight forward to make as Django will let you know that it doesn't provide a default create method in the serializer for nested objects, so you'll have to write it yourself. Perhaps not a big deal after you've done it a few times but i'm a bit surprised there's no batteries included on that front when they provide a whole admin interface for example. :)
Do you think it would be possible to bridge channels (ws) and views (api) so that data does not go through the database?
One thing we have done when hiring is paying for weekend projects like this, if we are asking you to do real work, you deserve real pay, even if we don't hire you. 
Yup. I'd recommend an upgrade to Linux or windows. SCNR
What about words like *body*, *script*, etc? Ideally you should identify the mime type and use something like BeautifulSoup or lxml to parse. Then walk the DOM looking for nodes you care about with the matching text.
I won't write code for anything bigger than a "toy" without being paid, that's just silly. And it doesn't really help to send snippets of a toy - they want to see how it's designed, not whether I prefer `[_ for _ in iterable if ..]` over `filter(lambda _:.., iterable)`.
Couldn't be more wrong. Not writing `for(int i=0;i&lt;10;i++){console.log(":(")}` is good enough. Happily python enforces it with it's syntax and there's always spaces in a for declaration :)
Yes, as long as the server can handle two requests concurrently (`xmlrpclib.server` can't, or at least not by default).
How can I make it possible? Any idea ?
What's your end goal here? Are you building an XML-RPC server?
nice! thanks.
I don't want to give my source code when deploying. Thus I want to produce "software as a service". The final project will be run in a virtual machine, and clients will just call it.
I never spend more than 2 hours on take-home assignment or coding tests and am very honest about it. If they want to see more of what I'm capable of doing, they should spend time on me just as I spend time on them. A small company that was salty as fuck that I didn't do their project and accepted another offer inbetween (because I had the perfect resume for the post) actually changed their policy because of me.
So you want to give someone a VM that they will run and not give them your source code? You do realise that the source code, or at least the bytecode, will be available in the VM image, right?
You will give them the disk image, and the disk image will contain your code. You don't need a password to pull data from an offline VM's disk image.
What is your suggestion then ?
What is your suggestions then?
Ok. Then forget about code sharing. But I again in need of VM, I will fine-tune it. First question still active. How can I call remote python service concurrently from more than one clients? 
The sensible answer is probably still "use HTTP". Also, as I said, it's basically impossible to "fine-tune" a VM.
Suggestions for what?
How can I concurrently call remote python from clients without interfering each other?
Use any web framework + gunicorn + nginx. Send your data over HTTP.
Looks like a paid feature. Correct me if I'm wrong.
Ah okay, that explains a lot :D Thank you!
Note they're talking about VS Code, which is wholly separate from and unrelated to the main Visual Studio suite. 
Okay, the fog is lifting more and more :D Those things kept annoying me. Now the only thing left that bugs me is ducktype but I guess I just have to adept to that.
It makes perfect sense to have some kind of code test. Especially if you're small, hiring a dud who has awful coding practices could be an expensive mistake. I think it's ok to ask for a SMALL sample of your work. Provided it IS small. I understand how you feel though, I've had my time wasted on some BS code tests. It's very frustrating. Particularly when they can't even do you the service of looking at your work in a reasonable time frame!!!
To the untrained eye, perhaps. But not for those who stick to the recommended way to install it. Until two days ago, I too was a pip junkie. I installed everything using pip but it wasn't until pipenv hit version 9.03 that I took the big leap forward with pipenv. And while the site does say that you can install pipenv using pip, it also says the following; To install pipenv in a fancy way, we recommend using pipsi. Pipsi is a powerful tool which allows you to install Python scripts into isolated virtual environments. To install pipsi, first run this: $ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mitsuhiko/pipsi/master/get-pipsi.py | python Follow the instructions, you’ll have to update your PATH. Then, simply run: $ pipsi install pew $ pipsi install pipenv 
There's a very solid Vim plugin for VS Code, so maybe try that.
Do you perceive the dress as gold or blue?
Why are you writing in a dynamic language, wanting to give the code to a customer but also want to keep the code top secret? These 3 things don't go together, no matter what roundabout solution you try to hack together...
Maybe host it at heroku or something? 
JetBrains IDEs are heisen-IDES; everyone but you has a problem with them being horribly slow somehow.
A magnetized needle over the hard drive.
what's done is no longer to be done :)
I gave a subjective answer based on what worked for me in this situation. So I'm neither right or wrong. And if you think not writing JavaScript is "good enough" for writing neat python, you need more practice. You can have ugly code that follows python syntax.
Downvoting for failing to read the side-bar. Please reformat your code so it is readable. Also, how do you expect us to magically guess what the problem is? Python prints you a nice error message with a pointer to the problem (or to just after the problem). Unless you copy and past that error message, how can we tell what's going on?
No company should make you do anything without prior payment. Your labour is YOURS, you have every right to withhold it. Font let others fuck you over, friends.
Love how you missed my point completely and ignored the fact that there was no proper identation, spaces where it would be appropriate and that it was all in a single line. Language has nothing to do with this. If you ever have to assume such things then you are the one who needs more practise because I was just poking fun out of people who actually write for loops like this.
Thanks, I'd better brush up on my Javascript and CSS then!
Really? Myself and other High schoolers (including Sophomores) have all done it fairly comfortably. While we didn’t do the bonus optional lessons which involved more complex math, overall I found it reasonably okay. 
Is this type of feedback and poking fun why you got banned from r/learnpython?
Ok, can you explain what about this syllabus is specific to high school students? How is it different to every other AI/ML self study guide? Is it equally useful for college undergrads? Might be limiting your reach by only marketing it to HS students.
Photoshop has a JavaScript API that could run a script that loops a folder, opens files and writes the info to some text file? You can probably manage the JS actions with COM as well.
Just one Tip: You may want to add a License, even if it's just the WTFPL or CC0 to give it into the Public Domain
Yes
Another alternative to your extension: https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/7vzb3f/wolf_a_vscode_extension_that_enables_live/ or: https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/7vzb3f/wolf_a_vscode_extension_that_enables_live/dtwmidw/ as VS Code has built-in debug setting for this already.
Even better, build a bot that tweets their Glassdoor reviews to their social media recruitment posts!
Sorry.
Yup
I was given a project similar to this. I'm curious if it's the same company. Would you mind naming them or linking to their GlassDoor?
Why not...rather than axing the take home assignments...we axe the stupid whiteboard interview part. Having someone complete a project is what they actually need to be able to do, including when under a lot of pressure. 
I mean it has the ability to store many big size data without having any problem.
Define “many” and “big”. MySQL is a terrible blob store but otherwise it’s decent. 
How about rather than trying to hit every single applicant with the attempt at recruitment silver bullet you do this: 1) Review their resume and any relevant background material 2) Talk to them face to face for two hours or so 3) If you have doubts about something follow up on THAT SPECIFICALLY Do not ask a senior developer with hundreds of public github commits to implement quicksort on a whiteboard. Do not ask an obvious introvert who just finished his/her degree to make some kind of ad hoc presentation in front of a room of people unless that is something they will be required to do from day one. And for the love of all that is holy, get rid of the programming tests with problems so insidious that even the creator of the language would get them wrong. They exist because someone was asked to create a test and they decided to, instead of creating something useful, show how clever they are.
That is absurd. Even over a weekend, people are likely have other commitments. What if the candidate has kids they need to spend time with? It's borderline discrimination. I hope you walked away from this "challenge", this shouldn't be considered acceptable.
https://github.com/kriadmin/30-seconds-of-python-code This really need contributors. Please 
It would have been fine if they had given a week ideas of 48 hours. Alternatively if the data worked with models better that would have been acceptable but they gave such raw data that the manipulation would take hours by itself. Possibly worse was that they refused to answer questions regarding the data. I asked them to explain the way Lyft calculates fares and applies surges and they told me "we can't answer data questions, use your best intuition" so I had to find it on their site and make some assumptions.
When I had sway over interview processes I lobbied hard to make it 5 minute up front test -&gt; ~25-30 minute phone screening -&gt; &lt; 2 hour face to face, which included 1hr - 1hr 15 test *realistically depicting actual work required* followed by a chat. I think that's the right balance. I also tried to give preferential treatment to people with code on their github profiles (e.g. if i liked what i saw, I asked that we skip straight to face to face, and I probably had a bias towards them even then). That didn't always work though. HR couldn't always follow instructions and would give out insultingly easy filter tasks to people who had published proof that they could code. 
SCAM EMAIL HARVESTER!!!!!
This is how they filter out people who are not going to fit into their culture.
&gt; Set is a collection of things or to be more precise it is a set of numbers. NEXT
Not this week but it has become presentable now https://github.com/kriadmin/30-seconds-of-python-code 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1a4Jbjc-vU might be interesting to you. She talks about some things that might be useful to grow Python/the Python community itself and not necessarily individual specific projects (but she always mentions some specific Python projects to aid with that goal).
Recent versions have Scientific Mode which does that. I'm not sure if that's just Pro, though. You can select it from the View menu, I think, or if you import numpy it asks if you want to switch to it.
Yes...I've noticed several of the worst companies are also the ones who put up their own positive fake reviews. 
Public domain wold be nice! 
What do you do when they give you a project to do for the interview process? 
Rest api with low cost. 
How good should someone be before they can start contributing? I dont know a lot of stuff but I've done a semester of python, got the basics down and am learning stuff like web scraping atm.
I'll wait a month and then do that, but here are the **emails** they sent me: https://pastebin.com/Tggt5Uq9
Awesome, I'll add one right now!
&gt; * 275 commits &gt; &gt; * 4080 added lines &gt; &gt; * 3432 deleted lines &gt; &gt; I found 109 jira issues related to this project. That doesn't sound terrible for 240 kloc... 
Most of that is fairly trivial stuff of course, but the problem is always that the trivial and the broken look so similar :P
Now I learned my lesson. Will ask for this next time! thanks
Same here. The fact that one editor/ide cant do multiple languages is a showstopper for me.
&gt; adthe fixed :)
Yes, could be done by just using Websockets. I this case they needed logs. 
Done!
That's absolutely fine. Nonetheless I'm still gonna give preference the guy who spent two half weekends working on a hobby project 3 months ago that clearly exhibited their skill and put it on github and I don't feel like that's especially unreasonable. Do you?
mmmm does the company name starts with W?
If cost is your concern a more flexible environment that’s equally inexpensive would be Heroku. My understanding of Lambda is that it’s on-demand computing. There is a boot-up cost. It’s designed to offer functions that respond to events. How does a web application fit in here??
Yes, I have some. I admit that I vary my method a lot and I work maybe too much on gut feelings but I'm not hiring for big businesses so I get a lot of leeway. Plus i'm a big believer that the probation period is a real thing. Sometime I'm good with a solid technical conversation. I remember telling one guy who was running circle around me technically in his domain that I would save us both the time if he could tell me he understood I would fire him on day two without an ounce of remorse if he couldn't actually write code. I've also noticed that devs are shit at respecting NDAs. I had quite a few guy join the web meeting from their work PC; shared their screen and gave me a rundown of all the core functions of various financial institutions that I will not name. One was genuinely surprised and spooked when I asked him if it wouldn't get fired for sharing internal code. I think he just realized he fucked up at that moment. What I would recommend is that if you've done something that is not core to your employer but still interesting ask them if you can use it for a presentation / blog / competition. 
 def factorial(num): if not ((num &gt;= 0) &amp; (num % 1 == 0)): raise Exception( f"Number( {num} ) can't be floating point or negative ") return 1 if num == 0 else num * factorial(num - 1) Okay, it took me less than 30 seconds, yeah. But this is written in most obnoxious and unreadable way, this is the first time I see this monstrocity, good job.
So they've basically followed [Porting Python 2 Code to Python 3](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/pyporting.html) and everything is okay. Would you believe it?
Actually, you shouldn't be too mad. You now have an awesome portfolio piece that has a lot of popularity. They were definitely dicks, but they indirectly helped you out and you made literally the best outcome of a shitty situation. This might be a good thing after all.
https://github.com/gco/xee/blob/master/XeePhotoshopLoader.m#L108 Unless you've already read this one. I haven't had to deal with Adobe products in a long time. Some of them weren't so bad, but the majority are overwhelmingly bad. So bad that you'd just sit in front of your screen giving it a blank stare for few minutes, contemplating living on a farm, never to touch a computer again.
I haven't ever played around with Heroku, but from a cost perspective, if you are using a low traffic site like a personal blog, this would all fall in the free tier for a new AWS account. With that said, for at least the first year, this would all be free on AWS and beyond the free tier I would expect less than $4 a month for the same small site (I have done this personally for a small app). Lambda does have a cold boot time, but many frameworks like Zappa make keep alive functions so the lambda stays warm. With a Flask app deployed with API Gateway, the HTTP call from API gateway is the event that gets passed to the lambda for processing.
We have plenty of issues that just require a bit of knowledge about Python. https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22+label%3A%22Effort+Low%22 We can walk you through using git if you aren't familiar with it.
That would actually be better in my opinion. Nonetheless that's usually a breach of contract. I've never known anybody to offer or ask.
The easy stuff is covered in that guide yes. But not the hard stuff. 
limit = 100 table = [True] * limit for n in range(2, limit): for k in range(2 * n, limit, n): table[k] = False for n in range(2, limit): if table[n]: print(n) 
Thanks for the feedback! Can you tell me how this can be improved? 
Most of them are utilities
Thanks for the clarity. 
There is a lot of code under the `if __name__ == '__main__':` line. Why not put that stuff into a function to avoid mucking up the global namespace? def main(): ... if __name__ == '__main__': main()
I have seen that most of the users at codereview.stachexchange recommend keeping lines shorter than 60 characters
Good point! Thanks!
Not naming the company is doing nothing but ensuring that someone else will soon fall victim to the same type of abuse. Don’t “wait a month” then right a bad review on a website where there are already tons of bad reviews. Don’t beat around the bush. You owe them nothing, they owe you money for labor. Don’t stir the pot, don’t embellish, just name them.
If they are, they'll probably be watermarked :)
Try putting it side by side by cutting that line weirdly like that and in the another one, keeping it intact in a single line. As to which one looks better and is more readable, your opinion.
What the hell? Isn't this illegal? What they did I mean
It is Open Source, under the MIT license. [Repo](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode)
WAAAAAAAA SOMEBODY CHANGE MAI DIAPER WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
I was thinking more about having a view get some data that arrived to websocket, without pushing that data to database. Any ideas about that?
&gt; do you think it would be more readable if I split every call to two separate lines just so they are under 60/80 char limit? No, but I think you should still do something about the long line length and code duplication. For example: def add_vertex(a, b, c): # parameter and variable names could be improved, just a quick example vx = x * cube_width + cube_width * 0.5 * a vy = y * cube_height + cube_height * 0.5 * b vz = cube_depth * 0.5 * c vertices.add((vx, vy, vz)) if direction == Normal.N.value: add_vertex(1, 1, -1) add_vertex(1, -1, -1) add_vertex(-1, -1, -1) add_vertex(-1, 1, -1) elif direction == Normal.S.value: add_vertex(-1, 1, 1) add_vertex(-1, -1, 1) add_vertex(1, -1, 1) add_vertex(-, 1, 1) # and so on for E, W, T, B In fact since it's possible to generalise much further, since it's about mathematical objects.
I tried hosting it on Heroku and it kept failing to due to dependencies that weren't installed for some reason (problem in the virtual environment). I know the requirements.txt I was using was correct, so I submitted a question to the support line but I haven't been having luckwith Heroku.
For the average, what happens with an empty list?
which means to work overtime at last moment notice, 3 days per week?
Good point. Yes, that's a good idea. 
Hello v3ssOn, thanks for your interest. But we're currently not hiring remote devs.
I just interviewed this past Valentine's day. I was given a two-part interview assignment with 24 hours to complete it. The misses was pretty pissed off. 
MickeyLater, I'm founder of the school. Could you please elaborate on what do you mean by your statement?
You're wrong. 1) "ipython notebook" is listed in the "free" column. Two, I'm running PyCharm Community with an ipython notebook in it right now. :-)
I can do most of the things that VS code provides in VIM using this https://github.com/amix/vimrc vimrc combined with tmux/zsh/git/ipython/ipdb The major painpoint for me right now is autocomplete, refactoring. Because the above vimrc doesnt provide that by default, and for some reason vim doesnt provide that by default. Autocomplete can be solved by something like `Neocomplete` and refactoring by `ropevim`. I am guessing even for VS code, its `rope` which provdes the refactoring engine. Do you have any good youtube videos on VS Code so I can check whether there is any compelling reason to switch to VS code, espcially with the wide adoption of VIM/Vim plugin ecosystem and its capability to automate things?
My intuition is telling me that means they half ass their requirements and expect you to be telepathic.
I'm finding it's commonplace for tech jobs of any kind at startups. I've had three separate all-day "code days" where they give you all day to pretty much make the impossible happen, meanwhile they randomly grab you to interview with folks. It's a large effort to do this for the job seeker, especially if they are a contract worker and don't have PTO to take for this. I won't even apply to start-ups anymore.
Curious to know how much did it cost (in terms of man hours or $) to move from Python 2 to Python 3?
A creator, contributor, PR reviewer, and Issue blaster of open source repositories is not working for free. They have chosen to sacrifice the trickle of income meeting the needs of single customers who demand non-open solutions for their right to be free in negotiating their worth and terms when entertaining salaried positions.
Nah, it'd need a lot of cleaning before I'd put my actual name to it.

That could be done, but the message that came from the web-socket should be stored somewhere temporarily. Could be RAM, could be Redis, could be a MySQL using the MEMORY engine, could be Cassandra. There are plenty of choices :)
Just a note, extensive use of `map()` isn't considered idiomatic Python - you should use list comprehensions to apply a function over a collection of elements. Also, in `count_by()`, `map(lambda x: x, a_list)` doesn't do anything! That lambda is just: ``` def f(x): return x ``` 
I know theres `PIL`, `openCV` and `imagemagick`. What do you see is the difference between these libraries? Why did you chose `openCV` and not `PIL` or `imagemajick?
A similar thing happened to me. I spent all weekend on a project where I had to learn a Javascript library I had never used. I submitted it and they went silent for 2 weeks. I couldn't reach them for followup. They finally emailed me to say, "Sorry, we forgot to tell you, we are reorganizing and that position doesn't exist anymore". I should have trusted my gut when the guy forgot to call me for the initial phone screen. Now as a rule I won't do an interview project unless I actually want it for my portfolio. 
The thing is that I use my notebook to prototype. It is a notebook with 8Gb RAM. So, 1GB is a lot of resource!
That sounds reasonable. A solid technical conversation is a really good indicator I think. &gt; I've also noticed that devs are shit at respecting NDAs. Have not had that happen yet, but that would certainly stop the interview immediately for me. My first job was as a software developer working on government software. Not really in a high security environment, but certainly elevated so I am a little bit more paranoid about this kind of stuff then some. Even if it is no longer strictly necessary for the kind of work I do now. I still close my notebook and blank my screen when someone comes in to the office. &gt; What I would recommend is that if you've done something that is not core to your employer but still interesting ask them if you can use it for a presentation / blog / competition. That isn't really possible for me since the things we do are either only useful for us (for example automated software updates/container deployment on servers that are not connected to the internet most of the time) or require special hardware to try out (like a ARINC429 avionics bus adapter/simulator or Iridium Satellite antenna). I was thinking about asking to open source our simulation of a A320 avionics bus that does not require special hardware, but then again: Who would this actually be useful for? I am also not really qualified enough to do meaningful presentations about this stuff to the kind of audience that would actually listen to such a presentation. 
I'd say `mydict.keys()[0]` fits into that. THe bigger issue is that supporting Python 3 has been a moving target. What you do to support 2.7 &amp; 3.0 is different than 3.2, is different than 3.3 is different than 3.4, is thankfully the same through 3.6.
You are correct. There are some bugs. I was really annoyed with those pyenv bugs. And I don't have projects as complex as Django servers for example. (I am wrestling with stuff like kivy, however) Regarding Armin's comment, it's probably a misread on my part. I'm just saying how I took it. There are a lot more direct ways of saying 'thanks, I'll get right on it'. I honestly believe that he has no intention to change things. When Armin wants something his way, Armin does it. Same thing with Kenneth Reitz. Like you, I did a lot of reading into the various issues and how they were respondingto them. I'd be a lot more wary of using pipenv in a production environment until I was absolutely certain of how we were going to get around or avoid its rough edges. I've got some 'notes to self' to remind me of them so that 3 months from now, I don't trip on them. With regard to pipsi, it just works for me. And it solves some previous headaches for me. I've these python bash like scripts that I've hated doing the 'sim link to bin' dance which pipsi handles quite nicely so I'm sticking with it. Love that pipsi list command too. Don't know why it doesn't work for you. I've come to python from the windows world were I was once a windows bigot. If it didn't say Microsoft, I wasn't using it. But my business partner insisted on a predominantly linux infrastructure. And python was to be the lingua franca in his domain. Took a while for me to adjust but I'm here now. And lovin it. Except for one small thing. When it comes to programming in python, I don't often run with the big dogs. I'm just not programmically savy enough to work around some edge cases nor do I want to spend the time to master the next flavour of the month concept. But these two tools intrigue me. And so I'm on board.
Curious to know why you decided to start your own open-source project, rather than join a similar one and improve on it? The reason I ask is because I see so much fragmentation in open-source, with everybody starting their own projects, rather than refining on a established project. For example, I use vim, but there are literally 10s of very good editors (vim, neovim, emacs, atom, vscode….). Why is there a need for 10 different projects and workflows? Even in vim, there is a huge fragmentation in the plugin ecosystem, and leads to doing the same thing over and over again in different projects. Some amount of fragmentation is good, because it leads to competition and leads to innovation. But if there is too much fragmentation, people just start avoiding the ecosystem due to the “paradox of choice”. Wonder what are your thoughts on this?
a strategy i find more fair for all parties involved and more effective for the developer is to set milestone payments. For example, a multiplatform app might look like this: 1. Build the administration GUI. Let the user see how they will be managing their application. It is fairly simple to implement and confirms you understand their product and their needs. it's an easy way to build trust 2. Build a version for one of the platforms: web, mobile, desktop, etc 3. Iterate over the other platforms 4. Fine tune 5. release Require payment at each milestone to proceed. If they are not happy, they can bailout at any juncture. You still get paid for partial work, and they don't have to go all-in. And it doesn't have to be a full platform. that was just an example. You could do it by feature or whatever
right, the problem is that I work remotely mostly. Maybe I should move away form startups and start working to corporations.
I spotted that as well but carried on reading as I enjoy a good laugh. I was disappointed, it was just another list comprehension tutorial like 100s of others that have previously been written.
IDE are scurry
Thanks for sharing!
there is dude called sentdex on youtube and he made self driving gta5 car...and he gets data via screenshoting of your own screen...look him up, he made it to go like 50fps if i remember correctly
Hey, I'm not a developer, I'm more on the ops side of things, so my usage patterns are probably a bit different. However that also means, that I have very strong preference to use Vi/Vim simply because it's usually the editor installed by default on Linux machines, so for me even desktop editor needs to be very vim-like before I consider using it. I've used gVim before. It's definitely usable, but not great desktop experience and on a scale between notepad and IDE it's more on the notepad end. Obviously being Vim, that's still very good. But I wanted something more.. So first I tried Atom and honestly, it wasn't that great. Working with tabs and windows was perfect, but the Vim plugin was atrocious. I think it boils down to the way Atom plugins work, where it's really hard to do things, that you need to do to emulate Vim properly. I mean it didn't even have command mode, that's like half of the emulation not implemented. For someone hitting ":wq" using muscle memory, getting used to press ctrl+s instead is just pain. Especially if you still end up using vim over ssh like I do, where pressing ctrl+s isn't doing the same.. The rest of the implementation was spotty as well. It's enough Vim to confuse you thinking you might use it just like Vim, but not enough to really do that once you move beyond **i**nsert, **a**ppend and escape.. Besides Atom was quite slow on my PC. That's why I tried VS Code. And holy shit, the Vim plugin is perfect. Obviously it's not complete Vim, but definitely good enough to use it daily. Most of the stuff I use daily works there just like it does in vim. Some things don't, but that's rare to see and usually VS Code itself provides usable alternative. I recommend checking plugin roadmap to get some idea, what's already in there. On top of that Code itself is noticeably faster. The only thing I really miss from Atom is ability to split windows both horizontally and vertically at the same time - code can only do one or the other plus tabs.
`compact(seq)` is the same as builtin `filter(None, seq)`
&gt; anybody who makes excuses for why this isn't meritocratic for some bullshit reason is wrong. You are filtering by sycophancy not merit. I guess it depends what you want in a dev. 
i filled the survey and didn't get any invite. Should I receive it on mail or what?
Where is x and y coming from? Sounds like waste of time. It's perfectly readable and lines aren't even long, they barely take up half of my screen which is only `1366`.
Please send me your bank account info and I'll respond back with it. 
Yes I have seen that and it is good but that's not what I am looking for. I want something that can constantly fetch data from an url were the live stream is running without actually looking at it. 
&gt; You're wrong. One of those times I'm glad to be wrong. :)
"scientific tools" is listed in the first area, left hand side. My understanding was it was much more than just an interactive ipython notebook, but a complete reorganization of the GUI to facilitate data science and engineering. 
There's no way to do it right now but we of course considering this option. It's still just a beta, there's a lot of thing to improve, that's for sure.
The premise of this video sounds interesting but I really wish some of these youtube videos would be tutorials instead. I can skim a tutorial much faster and decide if it is worth my time. I guess they are slightly harder to produce though.
We haven’t made any attempt to calculate it quite frankly. I’d estimate it’s clearly a lot lower than one full time developer for those 1.5 years, but for some stretches of time it was almost one full time dev...
We never even thought of anything before 3.5, that helped. 
Appreciate your detailed response. I will check out VS code and the plugin you mentioned.
Ah thanks!
Good to know. That really sucks, friend.
Thanks for the response. I was half just making sure I wasn’t being an idiot. I really enjoy using the platform and got pretty good responses from the couple of people I showed it to.
As per ralph's comment, the datetime module is all you need: https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html
I like the readme, good job! the chunking is a bit unreadable.. try this: def chunk(l, size): c = size return [l[i:i+c] for i in range(0, len(l), c)]
No, mine started with an I.
I want to learn vim and this seems helpful but I have no clue how to install it. Should I just try the vim thing in pycharm and maybe move over later?
Made me chuckle
That sounds hellish. I've had all day interviews where they ask questions or have you work on a project, but not both. It's pretty ridiculous considering they don't even pay you for a full day of work.
That's awful, usually it seems like they give you a few days to start. Sounds like a shitty place you don't want to work at.
I hope you refused to do it. That sort of time investment for free just to get a job is garbage. Someone at Lyft clearly has some sort of high and mighty complex going on, 10 hours is absolutely insane.
If you want to pay me for your bullshit code test then sure, but most of them are at least 4 hours and they want them done relatively quickly. That is not small to me. If it was small then their goal should be 30 minutes or something, not half a day of work.
There is no reason to assign size to c. Keep it as it is.
4 space indent for code formatting: limit = 10000000 table = [True] * limit for n in range(2, limit): if table[n]: print(n) for k in range(n + n, limit, n): table[k] = False 
How in the hell is writing code and publishing it online sycophantic?
Raises a ZeroDivsionError Would be better to have something like: def average(*args): if args: return sum(args, 0.0)/len(args) else: raise RuntimeError("Average of Empty List") 
It should work on any iterable containing objects that can be added together. Im not sure if “if args” would work properly on all iterables.
Amazingly better
You can even remove the last "else".
If you mean that the page needs to run some JavaScript function in order to get the time via an AJAX call or equivalent, you need to use a scraping framework with JavaScript support. If you don't mind using a web driver, you can use selenium. If you don't mind using Python 2.7 you can use dryscape (or port it to Python 3) https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8049520/web-scraping-javascript-page-with-python If the data is there, but in the wrong format, use datetime like previously mentioned.
I generally agree with you 100 % , but he said he's worried about line width of 60 characters (?) and assigning it to c prevents him from having to type it twice in full in the list comprehension.. 
In your chunk function, there's a few things that can be sped up/increase readability/be more pythonic. instead of from math import ceil def chunk(arr, size): return list( map(lambda x: arr[x * size:x * size + size], list(range(0, ceil(len(arr) / size))))) You want to 1. avoid using map, use list comprehension instead. This way you avoid the clunky looking lambda functions and return a list without having to call `list` 2. iterate over `range` instead of `list(range(...))`, it's necessary to allocate a whole list that you only ever iterate over once and it's just more code to look at. 3. just use `range(N)` instead of `range(0,N)` since that's the default behavior. So something like this would be a little more understandable from math import ceil def chunk(arr, size): return [arr[i * size:(i + 1) * size] \ for i in range(ceil(len(arr)/size))] 
if using `*args`, then `args` will be a python list
I think JavaScript is the right way to go with this. There are opening bindings for JavaScript. You could spawn a node.js process for reading the frames in js and pipe them to Python using the Subprocess module if you really want to stick with Python and use the minimal is required.
You could split that up into multiple lines. This isn't code golf.
I (badly) learned Qt's QPainter API's in C++ a zillion years ago, so I tend to use that for all sorts of stuff. Using it from PyQt means you can hack on half baked ideas from the REPL, tinkering with stuff happening on an already open window. I think it's worth checking out. Dunno if anybody would argue that it's "best" but since I have experience with Qt from previous projects, it fits my own mental model extremely well.
Sure I will take my entire weekend and for no money spend it making your widget for your company as an exercise. Yes, Sir! They are testing for sycophancy. They could discern your programming talents in 100 other ways.
You can get an EC2 instance on the free tier too. This just seems like a silly idea. Interesting, but silly.
I do not get it. Is it illegal? Recently we have changed our interview flow. After the resume is approved, we pass a simple programming challenge, a small web app, with simple business logic. Our review for the test is made in pair, and we look for tests, UX and architecture. We do not even set any language, the candidate can choose. This help us a lot! 30% of the candidates send the tests, and 2 in 10 pass by our criteria. So we sent a lot of emails saying the test was rejected. I really do not see any problem here. I would love to see why this is somewhat odd. Here in Brazil this stuff seems to be normal, if you want to join a good startup, we filter well. Does the candidate hope to join the team only by sending the challenge?
I was saying reversing the array might be a little more readable to a non-python user or new programmer than arr[-n:]
Might as well just cast the absolute value to int and avoid the exception handling.
The answer you got about the server starting threads does not apply to SimpleXMLRPCServer.
r/iamverysmart wants its leader back!
I concur with you that it’s good that you don’t work. 
Is not ilegal, but is a waste of time and effort. I think they already knew they didn't have the money to add more staff, but they did it anyway "just in case".
It's wasteful to check the error condition each time you recurse. A helper function or desmoulinmichel's iterative solution below would fix that
Nice summary, thanks. Regarding "'{}'.format(b'asd') is 'asd' in Python 2, but "b'asd'" in Python 3"... I recommend running everything with [python3 -bb](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#cmdoption-b). It makes Python raise an exception is such cases.
Thanx. I plan to use flick framework and gunicorn for parameter passing from clients to the server and vice versa.
Do you mean Flask?
Of course, sorry about the bad typo :)
Can you guide me to a basic example of it. I am not well versed in JS, sorry. But thanks. 
Ah. Great tip, didn’t know about that. 
That's a good option. Just keep in mind that Flask/gunicorn will block if you try to do expensive computations in your request handlers, so if you're doing something complicated, you'll probably want a work queue like Celery.
My concern with processing.py was differences in syntax. I'm really using this as a way to learn python, and it seems like there are a number of processing commands included that I'm going to grow used to, like all the various ways to draw shapes. I suppose this isn't a bad thing, and I could relearn the way to do it in native python if need be. But more concerning is that I won't be able to use all the python libraries (right?). I need to familiarize myself with numpy and scipy, and there's other various libraries that will be useful for specific projects. So ideally I would like an all-in-one python solution, but maybe processing.py is a good place to start if you recommend it.
What about Apache instead of gunicorn? 
Any HTTP server will block on long-running requests. If you can't respond within a few seconds (and preferably within under a second), you should use a work queue.
I got it. Thanx again.
What is overtime?
You can fuck off and all!!!
I honestly have a hard time believing that you are a 40x engineer...

My monitor is small. And I can open two files with 80+ char lines. If you have widescreen monitor I'm pretty sure you can open more. By the way, what happened to 30 screens all of you seem to have and use at once?
Not sure I agree. There's been a lot of discussion already about taking return out of the 'else'. I would say, 'explicit is better than implicit'. For the iterative version, you don't need the clause for `num == 0`: def factorial(num): if num &lt; 0 or num % 1 != 0: raise ValueError(f"Number ({num}) can't be floating point or negative") result = 1 for x in range(1, num + 1): result *= x return result
 reduce(operator.mul, range(1, num + 1), 1)
`x`, `y` and `vertices` already exist in your code, they are created inside `add_quad`. My proposal for `add_vertex` could be a nested function. I guess we just disagree on what we call 'readable'. To me the structure of the data (the negative and positive values) is lost between all the repeated elements. If there is ever maintenance to the code that would make it difficult, I think. I didn't mean that `add_vertex` could be used in other shapes, I meant that the whole creation of the cube can be reduced to a few repeating parts. Right now they are explicitly repeated in the code, but that repetition could be expressed through the logic of the code instead.
this calls for a ValueError, not a RuntimeError
this is generally really unpythonic code. noobs, please don't follow the examples here. 
Simply put, I've used `PIL` and I've never, or rarely, heard of `imagemagik`. `OpenCV` was something new to learn and it looks powerful. `OpenCV` is something I've never used and I'd like to know how to use it that way I will already have the learning curve dealt when a future project comes up that CV would be nice to have. `PIL` is good for simple projects. I used it when I needed to take an image from a file, resize and recolor it, then bring it into a numpy matrix. It was very limited and at the time and `Pillow` was more of a means to port it, rather than expanding its abilities. I think (though I'm not an expert) that `openCV` is better at parsing the elements of an image, and has the infrastructure to parse video feeds. So while both libraries can take an image, adjust sizes and colors, and do a few other things, I think openCV can has a lot more built in functionality that is focused on object detection and facial recognition. There are also a lot of tutorials and blog posts I've seen that use openCV so it would be nice to have a better understanding of the limits and abilities of the library. 
A single EC2 instance doesn't offer any auto-scaling, whereas if there's a sudden peak in demand, Lambda will automatically run your function on more instances. You may not have a use case for running WSGI apps on Lambda, but others do. It's far from a silly idea.
Nice idea. For lists, a good addition would be unique values in original order: ``` &gt;&gt;&gt; lst = [1,3,2,3,1] &gt;&gt;&gt; list({}.fromkeys(lst)) [1,3,2] ``` Above only works for python 3.6+. For lower versions it's a bit more involved.
I couldn't resist a one-liner with the gcd function: numbers = [8, 34] next(num for num in range(max(numbers), 0, -1) if all(n % num == 0 for n in numbers))
I would recommend ignoring 3.3 and 3.4 as well. I do support Python 2.7 and will be dropping 3.5 (and probably 3.6) before I drop 2.7. It's still used in my industry more than any version of Python 3. &gt; I wouldn't write new 3.6 code today that supported 2.7. It's literally no effort though. I will not handicap a package I write like that and I encourage other people to not either. It's the Python 2.7 Intel speedup that people wanted to reject because it was a new feature argument all over again. My packages have dependencies and I only support versions of packages from within 1 year of release. That with my 1 year release cycle gives you 2 years to be stuck on the same version. Numpy has their own deprecation strategy, so that can be mine.
I suppose that *java* supports the same thing now, and they’re usually paragons of restraint. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 
/r/learnpython 
I’d say put some focus into machine learning and AI. Along the way, you’ll need to have some study in Calculus 1,2, and 3. Then discreet math. People who have that can go freelance. Start showing off your super powers at hackathons and online coding competitions and soon you have clients coming for you.

And where can I get started in learning Python for machine learning and AI? 
This is literally a talk from a conference, recorded live. It's focus isn't even on "do this in python," it's about the database.
I appreciate all your effort. But buying a book isn't really an option in my case for monetary issues. What is the best free resource to start learning python.
I’m having luck with solearn.
Automate with python. YouTube channel. The author also has his pdf book online for free. Google it:
I'll give you the benefit of the doubt, but after I completed the questionnaire I was immediately taken back to the start of the questionnaire. That led me to believe that nothing had happened except your site gathering my personal information.
Thanks so much! 
I'm not familiar with Trio, but after a look at their tutorial it appears they have a solution for `async_to_sync` that seems quite robust (though it comes with a lot of extra stuff because they have more detailed features), but I can't see a `sync_to_async` equivalent. I might be missing it though.

I wasn't saying that anybody should make a widget for *my company* as an exercise. I hate that idea. I was saying that you should be able to complete some sort of hobby project that interests you in a weekend. It's not the only way to discern programming talent but it's probably the most efficient one.
None of the other commenters have touched on it, but Python is quite popular in the GIS realm. Probably ten years ago or so, ArcGIS (most prevalent GIS software) chose to integrate Python as a scripting language. There are other language options for scripting (incl Perl and VB Script) but Python is far and away the most popular.

Yeah, the no-source-code-until-paid-in-full policy needs updating anyway, because with many things these days, the source and executable are usually one-and-the-same (e.g. Python). I made that rule as a penniless 20-something, after getting stiffed by various clients (one even had the balls to indignantly suggest "Well, I HOPE you're at least going to give me the source code", after refusing to pay me).
Hey. Good job on collecting so many examples. I'm going to comment on the `gcd` function, but most of what I am saying can be transferred to your other examples. In this function you are taking a variable amount of arguments and finding the greatest common divisor. That is great. Don't do anything else. The spread operation should be performed outside the function. Try to keep each function as small and simple as possible. Moving on to the code itself: numbers = [] numbers.extend(spread(list(args))) is pointless as the function you are calling is making a new list anyways (this is a good _pure_ idea). Just say `numbers = spread(args)` instead. The final return contains a lambda that is pointless, and just screws up the readability. It is much cleaner as `return reduce(_gcd, numbers)`. Try thinking about the function signatures for a second, how is `lambda x, y : _gcd(x,y)` any different from `_gcd`? Whenever you are wrapping a single function in a lambda, and adding nothing to it, you could just use the reference to the original function. Finally, looking over some of the other examples here, it seems like you are coming from some other language with common functional constructs (javascript) and trying to apply those same ideas in python. Look up [list, set, dict, tuple, genereator] comprehensions. They are powerful bastards, that can accomplish most of what you would normally do with a map or a filter. Most of what you find in the `functools` package used to be reserved keywords, but they were demoted there to force people into comprehensions and loops. From "the zen of python": &gt;There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it. Try `import this` in a python interpreter :) 
&gt;And lastly, why aren't you using `max() and min()`? FTFY 
Images as in bitmaps? That's pretty great. I like the idea of "here, you can see it, but you can't easily _use_ it until I get paid"
This post made me doubt that `filter(None, seq)` removed all falsey, for a second I thought it might have just removed `None`.
Surely the best you can do is just loop through the numbers comparing and replacing the n largest numbers (in a list) after each iteration. Sorting would just make the worst case scenario even worse.
Also, what is the best way to cycle through these and compare the appropriate columns, given that each dataframe has a different number of columns but the same column names?
Much more than half the applicants that get to me (let alone all the people that recruiters or phone screens that are filtered out) are people we pass on due to (apparently) poor technical skills. My intuition for us if that that's equally regardless of their previous seniority or anything their resume says. If you have significant, or impressive work available for review on github, that's worth more to me than any take home or most in person technical questions. But most people don't list github profiles on their resume or have any work worth looking at.
You should fetch the stream with ffmpeg and send that to openCV
That code does not follow PEP. You should do try: return sth/len(sth) except ZeroDivisionError(e): raise ...
List comprehensions aren't more readable simply because you split them into 2 lines. 
What is this?? 
So to do a migration you'd use your orm to read all the data you need, modify it, transform the db, then use your orm to write the modified data back in?
Lol
Qutebrowser is a really awesome vim like web browser written in Python. The developer is an approachable person, and the project has a list of bugs and feature requests sorted by difficulty for people to work on. I've been meaning to contribute myself, but am still struggling with some programming fundamentals.
Ah damn, that's a shame about the icon, I half integrated it but it still has the same issue even though the "window" already exists. If I set `notification_id` to match the actual tray icon (as it's made in almost the same way), it can spawn multiple notifications, but the callbacks no longer trigger. I made a post earlier on SO, no luck yet though :p [The code I have](https://github.com/Peter92/MouseTracks/blob/master/core/os/windows/pywin32/tray.py) is pretty much cleaned up from someone else's work with some quality of life features added, but it's still a bit confusing. It's a mess as I was only testing, but [here](https://pastebin.com/eHXj2zwf) was my quick attempt at combining them. One of the parts I'd suggest copy over if possible is `win32gui.PumpMessages()`, it avoids the need for while loops, but it still processes the callbacks as they happen. You could also pass the class instance into each function so they can call the quit function, instead of having to use global variables :) Keep up the good work though lol, nice you've done some of the major improvements so fast. I've still yet to fully figure out how I'm actually going to get it working in the project, but I'm a sucker for feature creep so I definitely want to use it :D

A more specific question actually. I recently realized it's not trivial to export what I make in native processing. What is a good way to export mp4 or gifs with processing.py? I've been using [Video Export](https://www.funprogramming.org/VideoExport-for-Processing/), but after loading it into a python test sketch [with add_library('VideoExport')], I can't get the rest of the videoexport commands to work. Any alternatives or suggestions?
&gt; generally agree with you 100 % , but he said he's worried about line width of 60 characters Just because someone is doing something silly, doesn't mean you have to copy them ;)
As a noob, I really like the idea of this. It seems like a good way to learn various techniques, formatting and syntax. I'll check it out, but I'd prefer examples that are implemented well. Are there any similar alternatives you'd suggest?

Heh, I was going to mention [Trio](http://trio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing.html) and [async-ifying urllib3/requests](https://github.com/njsmith/urllib3/issues/1), but I see others have already beat me to it! If anyone wants to know more about these lmk, I'm definitely interested in helping you get up to speed. Since those were already mentioned, let me also point out that [Warehouse](https://github.com/pypa/warehouse/) is seeking contributors, and has done a lot of work lately to make it easier to get started. This is the project that will become PyPI in the next few months, and your code could help ship petabytes of Python packages (say that three times fast...). The rest of the Python package ecosystem is also super starved for contributions (e.g. pip needs lots of work), but that's probably harder to get started on because there's more legacy code and fewer mentors with time to help.

[This one](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DVn6FjuW4AA5VqE.jpg) is amazing
Thanks for the explanation.. The reason, I started the current project I am working on is every similar to how you started your project, though I dont know as much about python as you did. That makes a lot of sense. I used to work on FEM some time back, but mostly used COMSOL during my PhD..Its amazing that you have been building it for 6.5 years. It must have been a great learning experience. If its in public domain, would you mind sharing the link to the repo? Also you mentioned you dont want to create a package. Do you mean build a `.exe` with something like `pyinstaller`? If so, are there any challenges of doing that? The reason I ask is because, for the package I am working on, I am thinking of creating a small `.exe` for the end user, while most of the application runs on a central server. Wondering if there is something I am not thinking of. 
Depends on the list comprehension.
I do agree that 80 seems unnecessarily restrictive sometimes (I don't usually worry till I get to about 100), but maybe [something like this](https://hastebin.com/nipewosute.py) for your example?
the fact that the fn is a parameter allows for the user to pass in _how_ they want to count_by. like, maybe the user wants to bucket the data (using //) or something. by default, however, this lambda says just count by the actual element.
y u no comprehensions? `count_occurences` for example, assuming we can't use `list.count` because we want to check the occurrences of items based on the output of function `foo`. Yours: def count_occurences(arr, foo): return reduce( (lambda x, y: x + 1 if foo(val) else x + 0), arr) With comprehensions (bonus: no imports) def count_occurences(arr, foo): return sum(foo(x) for x in arr)
Wow some of these are either outright bad or already implemented better in the language or stdlib. def compact(arr): return list(filter(lambda x: bool(x), arr)) Assuming this is Python 2, you are iterating `arr` twice. If it's Python 3, you're throwing away laziness. In either case, `filter(None, arr)` is better or if you want to be explicit just use `filter(bool, arr)`. Protip: if you find yourself doing `lambda x: some_func(x)` just pass `some_func` def count_occurences(arr, val): return reduce( (lambda x, y: x + 1 if y == val and type(y) == type(val) else x + 0), arr) wut.jpg First, don't use `type` like this, you're throwing away subclasses because of the strict comparison. class Parent: pass class Child(Parent): pass type(Parent()) == type(Child()) # False, equal to Parent == Child If you *really* need to be sure you're dealing with the correct type, you should instead do: `isinstance(y, type(val))`. instance(Child(), Parent) # True issubclass(Child, Parent) # True I see a whole bunch of your examples abuse `type` like this. However, it'd be better to just use `==` and let `__eq__` sort out what it means to be equal. Here's a better, more readable and more compact version: `lambda arr, x: sum(x == y for y in arr)` def spread(arg): ret = [] for i in arg: if isinstance(i, list): ret.extend(i) else: ret.append(i) return ret def deep_flatten(arr): result = [] result.extend( spread(list(map(lambda x: deep(x) if type(x) == list else x, arr)))) return result Hoooo boy. Ignoring that this doesn't run (I'll assume that `deep(x)` was suppose to be `deep_flatten(x)`) you're again abusing `type`. But more importantly, you can implement this in a purely recursive way in less line by taking advantage of `itertools.chain`: from itertools import chain from collections.abc import Iterable def flatten(it): for item in it: if not isinstance(item, Iterable): yield item else: yield from flatten(item) Pros: 1. Operates on any iterable not just lists -- tuples, sets, dicts, strs, generators, etc 2. It's lazy if you need it, otherwise you can eagerly evaluate it with `list` or similar. 3. Use the very awesome `yield from` Cons: 1. Only runs on 3.3+ (Is this really a con though?) def difference(a, b): b = set(b) return [item for item in a if item not in b] Why not `set(a) - set(b)`? def capitalize(string, lower_rest=False): return string[:1].upper() + (string[1:].lower() if lower_rest else string[1:]) Just use `str.capitalize` instead. def is_lower_case(str): return str == str.lower() Again, this is an operation on str: `str.islower`. Ditto for the uppercase. def count_by(arr, fn=lambda x: x): key = {} for el in map(fn, arr): key[el] = 0 if not el in key else key[el] key[el] += 1 return key If you're going to ignore collections.Counter, you can at least use either `dict.setdefault` or `collections.defaultdict`: def count_by(arr, fn=lambda x: x): counted = {} for elm in map(fn, arr): counted[elm] = counted.setdefault(elm, 0) + 1 return counted Or def count_by(arr, fn=lambda x: x): counted = defaultdict(int) for elm in map(fn, arr): counted[elm] += 1 return counted
This is awesome.. I work mainly with `vim` with `tmux`, `ipython` and a lot of plugins using this `vimrc`: https://github.com/amix/vimrc. I know there is `eclim`, which allows you to run `Ecllipse` and use `vim` for editing. Does that `pydev` also integrate well with `eclim`? How long would you expect, I would need to configure it to work well with VIM?
I think `map` is fine, especially if you'd just be doing `[f(x) for x in xs]`
Hot dog? Or not hot dog?!?

Structure looks fine. Make sure you have all your build cruft in the root directory. Data used for unit tests are generally called fixtures. I would recommend not having duplicates of files - maybe have a common directory. Pytest lets you compose fixtures together, which might be helpful. I, personally, would fight tooth and nail to avoid having anything to do with XLSX format. If it's small, use a CSV (potentially with pandas). If you don't need it to be human-readable, use SQLite. Maybe I misinterpreted what you're saying, but you shouldn't be shipping your actual data with your code. That's hell on your version control system. If the data gets big, it'll probably be going into a relational database anyway, in which case you'd want to be talking to postgres or something over HTTP.
Use two functions - one to check the input is a positive integer, the second to do the recursive bit. Otherwise you're checking the Type for every single recursion which is inefficient and unnecessary. You can define one of them inside the other if you want to keep it as "one function".
&gt; If its in public domain, would you mind sharing the link to the repo? It's not public domain. It's BSD-3. Public domain means that nobody has a copyright to it, which at least in the US is not something you can give up, even if you say it is. Public domain means your copyright period is over and is from pre-1972. Sorry, license rant... I run [pyNastran](http://pynastran-git.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). &gt; Also you mentioned you dont want to create a package. Do you mean build a .exe with something like pyinstaller? By build, I mean compile. pyInstaller isn't actually making an exe. It looks and sounds like an exe, but is not an exe. As I'm sure you know about the FEA community, they're not very good at working with C++ and neither am I. Pure Python=easy to install from source.
If you do, ping me!
I'll be 40 in June :) So, you shouldn't believe I'm a 40x. I wrote my first code in QBasic on a ПЛДИНГ computer (well, terminal, back at the days, in schools they had something like 284 and a dozen of terminals), this particular system was a Bulgarian knock-off of a similar IBM product.
Every vertex is explicitly defined for every face, not sure what's wrong with it. I wanted to make it readable, not low LOC.
This only fails when conda is not activated. And that's kinda the point. The environment should _not_ be on your path if it is not activated. The older way of adding conda was actually pretty sketch because you would have the root environment on your path by default, but the environment was not guaranteed to be properly activated. Now with the recommended setup for 4.4, if conda is on your path you can be sure that some environment is active.

This should be on the top. It's fantastic news for VSCode users like myself. I'm using the extension right now and loving the results.
Regarding cost: the free tier allows 1,000,000 requests per month - and the Lambda free tier does *not* expire after the first year, but lasts indefinitely. For a low traffic site (if 1M total requests can be considered low) you could conceivably run the application server for free. 
I have to say, /u/breamoreboy, your comments in this post make you look like a total arrogant asshat. I'd say you have attitude problems, and I have to agree with /u/kankyo that it's good that you aren't working.
No-one is going to be able to help you if you don't link to the video or the script you're running. What you've posted so far isn't very helpful.
Don't use YouTube as a platform to learn programming. Pick up a book.
Hi, This is literally my area. So I have found that Quandl has a great data set. If it is stocks you are interested in I have knocked together a basic script. Feel free to have a look at the code. https://github.com/tg12/quandl_py_stock_bot 
This is flipping awesome!
Excellent article! However, I would have used a picture to better explain this passage: *In the asynchronous world, things change around a bit. Everything runs on a central event loop, which is a bit of core code that lets you run several coroutines at once. Coroutines run synchronously until they hit an await and then they pause, give up control to the event loop, and something else can happen.*, I've found it's hard for people to understand coroutines suspension only with words and maybe a picture that shows the various calls in a serialized fashion might help. But definitely one of the best introduction I've read!

`REAL_OR_NO_REAL` haha ... I'm wondering why you didn't just call this variable `gateway` or something. Guess you're a fan of game shows :p 
I must say I haven't ever used `eclim`, so, I can't really say... What I've done is create a language server protocol which exposes PyDev to be used on VSCode along with an extension in VSCode in javascript to bootstrap it... so, it'd need something as https://github.com/prabirshrestha/vim-lsp or https://github.com/natebosch/vim-lsc to work (although there are things needed for the setup in the client to startup the communication, which are done in javascript, so, I don't think it'd work out of the box). I'll take a look at what would be needed to add it to vim (although I already know I won't be able to do it within the next month, but if it's possible I'll post details on how to do it).

"Why" would you want to learn django - well. If you want to work on web applications, django is a sensational tool. There are many django projects in active development out there, so you will not have a hard time finding a job in the area. Also it is writting in and develoed on in python, which is simply amazing. That being said, if you don't want to be a web developer, learning django has little benefit for you unless you want to learn about good code design, python or frameworks in general.
Thanks bro, I will learn it soon
&gt; I think there many things left for me to still learn That's okay, but that's also why you shouldn't put together a "currated" list of examples that does itself seem knowledgeable when it isn't. It's also for that reason that I won't submit a PR and I'd actually encourage you to take down that repo. I don't mean to come off as a hardass or rude, but the samples in the are largely a disservice to newcomers who won't be able to tell the difference between actual handy pieces and things that are poorly implemented at best. 
&gt; fundamental stock analyses fundamentals usually refer to the quality of the business itself - revenue, expenses, cashflows, management, strategy, competition, economic conditions, supplier/client relationships. there's not much here that python can help you with. 
Let me assume you want to do *technical* analysis rather than *fundamental* as you have thanked this other answer: https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/7yupmz/learning_how_to_do_fundamental_stock_analyses/dujb8uv/ My guess would point you in the direction of https://www.reddit.com/r/algotrading/ where you would find more resources about the topic. There are some posts right now quoting some Python platforms to use (or learn form). I could requote it here ...
Unfortunately, with that change my problem persists. However, if I, for example, change **processes = None** to **processes = 4**, then the program will terminate normally. This seems to be an issue with the number of cores involved. Perhaps there is a hardcoded and undocumented limit to the number of processes that are actually supported. 
Do you usually get a feeling about the actual skill of the applicant before you do some kind of test or assignment or is it always 50/50 at that point?

I haven't had a chance to look at the code yet. My goal is to start with the basics ... Revenue, expenses, etc., as you mentioned. I could do this on paper, Excel, or Python....I just figured I'd mention Excel and Python in case someone has a spreadsheet and/or code that I could follow along with while I learn.
Do you judge the technical skill mainly by testing or by talking? Is this a separate step in your interview process or is it worked into the interview?
I haven't had a chance to look at the code yet. I'm interested in using python to efficiently do fundamental stock analysis....not technical analyses. Thank you though!
I'm just starting out with Python (I'm quite comfortable with Excel). I'd like to use this as an opportunity to learn how to do fundamental stock analyses and give me more practice with Python. 
Can you perhaps help me out? I have bought a Chromebox i7 to run Linux on. But I am scared to delete Chromeos if I install Linux. How can I make sure I don't delete the Chromeos when installing Linux? Also I wanted to first install Ubunto and then use virtualbox to get used to Arch to be able to install Arch on it when I am ready. Do you have any experience with Ubunto vs. Arch? I'm going to study Computing Science after the Summer, that's why I wanted to eventually install Arch as I have a lot of spare time to play around with it. The only thing is I am afraid I might damage the Chromebox or as a accident delete Chromeos or something like that. It's a chromebox i7 HP with 4 GB Ram. Hope you might know what I should do. There is a lot of info on the internet, but sometimes it is only specifically for a certain device right? That's why I am a bit scared I might damage the chromebox. But on the other hand I did read most issues are from devices not being intel but rockship or something else, mine has an i7 so that won't be a problem I think... Or do you think I should firstly use the Chrome to use codecademy and get familiar with Computer Science first and then install Ubunto or Arch? Hope you might have some advice for me : ) 
I am in the same boat and faced the same dilemma, why use python for DCF when excel can handle it? To help myself practice I would build the model in excel first to learn the fundamentals of the analysis you are doing then reprogram in python to get the python experience. 
Not limited to image hash though! What about visually similar images? Could be a way to get introduced to computer vision.
A bit of a misunderstanding here it seems. Python can definitely help you with fundamental analysis, as many fundamentals either are scalar values, or can be converted to scalar values. Quandl, as someone else suggested, contains a decent amount of company fundamentals. From there, either you can hard-code various ratios and relationships that you want to look for in companies, or you can just something like machine learning to find them. One option is to do clustering, and let the machine just find certain groups, then use this for your own research. Another is to hand-label buys/sells, and then train a classifier. Lots of options to work with here. Since there are lots of companies to sift through, Python is definitely going to help you a ton with fundamental analysis.
I'm kind of mind-boggled right now. If you're a self-noted noob then why do you create a learning resource for noobs? Wouldn't you need a bit more experience and confidence? 
Crouton is installed as a chroot so you won't risk deleting the underlying OS. What is the exact model? Is it this one? https://www.amazon.co.uk/ASUS-Chromebox-Desktop-2-1GHz-Chrome/dp/B00M0M8760
Is it though? `map(str, items)` is a lot less noisy then `(str(x) for x in item)`
Hi! It's a Chromebox HP i7 with 4 GB ram and product number: J4C98AA. Do you perhaps have a link of the website I should use with the steps I should follow to properly install it without risking losing the Chrome OS? There are so many out there, I have no clue which one to use right now.

both and both unfortunately, but (and much of this is out of my control) a lot of this is due to not everyone being the same and there needing to exist a candidate funnel. If every (or most) candidate had a useful github profile with actual work on it, I'd love to have my interviews only be conversational and technical only insofar as we talk about technical topics. But (made-up/gauged percentages follow) 70% of people don't have any github profile on their resume, 90% of people dont have anything useful to review on their profile even if it exists. What's the next best substitute for those people? A take home assignment! Ignoring anything about how long we expect them to work on it, they can actually write something that works, test it without someone breathing down their neck, make it nice and as idiomatic as they like/are able. If the assignment isn't stupid and formulaic, then submissions will be varied, there will be design decisions and I can actually use it to gauge their tech skill; and again...the interview *conversation* to follow. What's the next best thing when you don't have anything like actual working code to review? inevitably bad whiteboarding questions that are skewed by people that aren't necessarily confident in interviews/live "coding" Imo, the problem is twofold: * people who legitimately (meaning they're not completely clueless) complain about interviews/take home assignments fall into the first step above, where they have proof of their ability publicly available * companies try to create a candidate funnel, but don't dynamically react to those candidates by allowing them to bypass the mechanisms that filter out poor candidates

I can continue to increase the number assigned to **processes** and have it continue to work until I reach a value of 20 or 21. &gt; 20, it fails all of the time. With a value == 20 it fails some of the time. With a value of &lt; 20, it always succeeds. When I set **processes = None**, I get 27 entered messages immediately.

How do you judge whether a snippet is a good snippet? What part of the community engages on a thing like this with PR? Because the JS version degraded into a "show-off your most clever arcane oneliners" kinda place, not something to look at for good, readable code.
According to the [Github page](https://github.com/seatgeek/fuzzywuzzy), it uses [Levenshtein distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance), which is O(n^2 ).
I've been working on a toy programming language. The front end is written in Python, with the actual compiler guts implemented in LLVM by way of the llvmlite library. Features so far include: - Strong typing - Minimal string handling (basically, printing, and that's about it) - Function calls (but no function pointers or function-as-object handling) - Multidimensional arrays - Various logic constructs: if/then/else, switch/case, etc. Toy that it might be so far, I've been able to implement Conway's Game of Life in it, in a console version. And I've also been able to get it to generate standalone binaries with no dependencies save for the platform libraries: Life compiles to a single 13K executable on 64-bit Windows. I'm hoping someday it'll be more than a toy!
I think ultimately, I need to implement a queue system. Where each object has to wait a certain amount of time, before its request can be completed. I guess that is also an ASYNC io problem, cus we don't wanna let the application hang. ![queu](https://i.stack.imgur.com/phzXA.jpg)
But implementing scrapy into your existing project can be fooking difficult. Thanks though, you are right it is technically feasible. Perhaps it's more scalable and bug-proof long-term.
You're a legend mate.
Right. I've only been able to login, and read a single range of data. Haven't tried any manipulation, but I have seen some bug reports for gspread, though.
&gt; pygsheets Cool, thanks for the help! I didn't run across that one in my research.
well i don't want to argue and will just say everybody has their own opinions and I won't argue with someone to change theirs 
Look into data analysis packages like numpy and pandas. They allow you to quickly perform functions on huge datasets and dataframes without having to loop through them. (I just read the second paragraph of your post half way through writing this comment, this is for technical analysis....im not deleting it, i have come to far) https://www.scipy.org/
Wondering, how did you learn it? Are there any books, or did you learn through working? I'm beginning to write some basic algorithms, but they aren't very successful on backrests.
Hi, Trial and error and investing for years helps. My goal last year was to learn Python or Powershell. I chose Python. 1st class degree in Software engineering didnt help one bit however. So I just got my head stuck in. Stackoverflow and Github was literally it. You can seriously find anything on there. I read No books or watched No YouTube videos. Hope that helps! 
Im still trying to build a bot based on a self learning net to beat me in my variant of a connect4 game. If you would like to help or contribute, let me know. 
Probably, but if you are doing processing of frames of video and performance is a major concern, it's not guaranteed that Python is the right thing to be using. As always, "measure twice, cut once." Start by profiling to see if decoding frames is a significant part of your run time. If OpenCV is doing it fast, it may not matter if ffmpeg does it faster. If you depend of some functionality in OpenCV for your processing, you would also need to get a frame from ffmpeg, then turn it into an OpenCV mat structure for processing in OpenCV, which might obliterate any performance benefit from ffmpeg. FFMPEG's fastest performance will obviously be if it can take advantage of some hardware for decoding the video. Often time that hardware lives on the GPU and the fastest path is to decode it directly to an OpenGL texture rather than bringing it back to CPU memory. If your processing needs to happen on the CPU, that might also obliterate any theoretical advantage of ffmpeg.
Didn't expect the second link, thank you.
If you are on Linux, OpenCV uses ffmpeg (assuming you had it installed when you built OpenCV) to do a lot of the encoding and decoding of the video. So in theory the convenience of OpenCV would probably be worth the little bit of overhead. 
Try sentdex's tutorials: https://pythonprogramming.net/getting-stock-prices-python-programming-for-finance/ He has tutorials for many things in Python and he explains really well.
Building an app with Kivy for my wife to use in Kid’s Church. Right now kids get points for attendance, bringing their Bible, knowing their memory verse etc... This is all recorded by hand currently. The app will allow someone to search for a child’s name in our church directory and select “stars” to accrue the points each week and store in a database. Just learning Kivy and have been finding projects like this to help the learning process. Also finishing a program for work that allows us to take a CNC program from one machine and convert it to run on another machine.
I don't think I can contribute but I am interesting in reading the code you have so far.
your idea's not a bad one, it's just these examples are not pythonic. which isn't surprising since you're a self-declared noob. i'll give you an example and how i'd clean it up. here's what you have: def max_n(arr, n=1): numbers = deepcopy(arr) numbers.sort() numbers.reverse() return numbers[:n] instead, i'd do something like: def _n_extremes(arr, n, *, find_max): return sorted(arr, reverse=find_max)[:n] then i could just do: def min_n(arr, n=1): return _n_extremes(arr, n, find_max=False) def max_n(arr, n=1): return _n_extremes(arr, n, find_max=True) if i wanted to avoid copying the list and be a little faster in the case of `n = 1`, i might do: def _n_extremes(arr, n, *, find_max): if n == 1: return (max if find_max else min)(arr) return sorted(arr, reverse=find_max)[:n] 
i made a comment below with some cleanup if you want to check it out.

[Keepmenu](https://github.com/firecat53/keepmenu)...a dmenu powered frontend for Keepass. The only upside of being sick at home for a couple of weeks! The last big feature I need to add is adding an entry. Otherwise it's very usable already. Feedback welcome!
I've dabbled in `gspread`. I can't say much for the others. If you do use `gspread` though, know that one of the slowest steps is connecting to and then writing a row of data. So if you have a tall and skinny spreadsheet you want to upload, you might want to consider dumping it as a short and wide spreadsheet and then transposing it afterwards.
Flask, Django etc...
Which one do you recommend??
I know Flask but I'd like to look at Django. I hear it's cool.
Flask first, then Django later
I'd love to see this, very interesting idea, hopefully will get kids more involved and excited about church 
Why?? But I hear that Django is better than flask
Thank you!
Thanks everyone for your suggestions. I just finished watching [this one by Microsoft](https://youtu.be/TV9tSHFAFjg)and it made a lot of things click for me. Can’t wait to check out all the suggestions here. 
Oh! Which book do u suggest me?
Thank you for your help. My goal is to start with fundamental analyses, and eventually move on to technical analyses. 
I would start with Django. It is more opinionated, and dives you a lot more out of the box. Start with the official documentation/tutorial. Flask is good to know once you have a decent understanding of the various concepts that go into making a backend web server. 
Django+channels is hot right now. Async webapps are all the rage. 
Would it be possible to flash micropython on those HP chips instead?
Mathematica is wonderful in terms of sheer computational power, but the notebook interface it presents is hopelessly outclassed nowadays by initiatives such as these. I keep hoping Wolfram will spring some impressive new interface on us that will enhance usability for power users (rather than their weird attempts at bringing ‘computation’ to random casual users), but... I'm giving up hope. This looks very impressive.
Its not very clean and there are not a lot of comments, but you can play the game vs yourself if you run main.py and you can see the net at neuralnet.py. The rest is just training, validation or other tries to make the net better. I store nets in pickles. Do not open these as they can be a security risk. https://github.com/tweakimp/twisted-four-python I would like to hear your opinion :)
LOL I've never ever seen James in anything other than suits
I bought this course on udemy for $10. Haven’t started it but it looks good https://www.udemy.com/python-for-finance-and-trading-algorithms/
Why does it need to be OOP?
What the fuck kind of casual user can afford Mathematica anyway?
Best of luck! I did some latlong georeferencing of tagged images that involved an affine transformation. Let me know if I can be helpful! One thing that helped me out was having a library that can convert between latlong and utm. Utm is nice because it is a square grid as opposed to degrees of an oval.
Use Excel not python for fundamental analysis. Making it way more difficult on yourself.
I have to be honest: The only thing I like so far about JupyterLab is the new tab-completion. I've already uninstalled JupyterLab from my Anaconda distribution.
Whatever you want to call it, It works. 
Raspberry pi comes with Mathematica. So, among other things, $35US gets you Mathematica.
He is asking about fundamental stock analysis and you've posted some regression code on stock prices which is not what he is asking for - that's my point. I certainly would recommend nobody actually trades on the code you have written as it's a sure fire way to lose money.
Curious to know what is the advantage of making webapps using django/flask? Aren't most webapps made in javascript?
Whats the point of JupterLab when there is Jupyter, Pycharm, WING IDE, Spyder, VS Code, VIM etc..
I've been using Alpha for several months now and I can't really imagine going back. JupyterLab outdoes Jupyter Notebook on the strength of its interface alone, and I'm excited to see how its extensions ecosystem will push it further.
Perhaps you can create a kernel for mathematica and connect the mathematica kernel through jupyter, like people do for `R` and other languages..
Thank you for your honesty. I'm deliberately trying to use Python, but if you have any recommendations for tutorials or step-by-step using Excel, please let me know. Thanks again.
Not sure if this will help but I found this repository off a blog post I couldn’t rediscover a week or two ago. It’s an AI based off of alpha go zero that plays connect four. This might help you. https://github.com/Zeta36/connect4-alpha-zero/blob/master/readme.md

Try changing: `if profanity_list in comment.body and comment.id not in comments_replied_to and comment.author != r.user.me():` To a loop going over your profanity_list, the error is telling you that the "in" is expecting a string not a list. 
Eyyy i used your videos to get started in the Halite game! Although later on in the competition i got banned... (probably deservedly) 
Thanks for the heads up!
Worth pointing out that Microsoft might add Python as a scripting language for Excel (like VBA). No ETA or anything, though.
The only advantage I could see to writing it in python would be having the ability to extend the type of analytics in the same application if OP decides later on they would like to explore regressions or machine learning algorithms. 
You shouldn't use filter or map in general. List comprehensions are far superior and map/filter is only there for legacy.

Thanks! I'm not going to add one into the article at this point, but I will likely use a diagram when I give a talk about this at some point.
For technical analysis, you can just use from random import random And save a bunch of time.
JIAN YANG!
Pretty useless
My first setup of xlWings with anaconda took me 15 minuts.
&gt; return numbers[:n] Thanks! I will update the snippets as soon as possible
I disagree. They're useful for when you just need to map or filter an iterable. They're also curryable with functool.partial which is also very useful.
Thank you!
I hope your mortgage issuer doesn't base your rate on TA.
It's not matter of agreeing or disagreeing, map/filter is objectively unpythonic. Everything you said you can do with list/generator/dictionary comprehension.
Great nowadays applications taking on micro services paradigm so Flask and connexion should be your next step. Django is great but it’s everything together. If you want to get a whole website up and running fast then Django is the way to go. 
came here to recommend sentdex. top quality!
&gt; Maybe mention that min_n and max_n are implemented in the standard library as heapq.nsmallest and heapq.nlargest. I already know it(I think you are the fifth person to point this out). I just wanted to show users how it can be done without any imports. And yeah I will add information that this can be done with an inbuilt function
still funny nonetheless
&gt; for the difference between 2 lists a and b, why not just do: Thanks for the feedback. I will try my best to update it as soon as possible but a PR from your side will be much appreciated
I've seen him at a conference before, and he only wore suits the entire time, in Austin in July. Dude knows how to dress sharp.
Get better notebook if you value what you do profesionally.
Have you tried https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi-vim or was it not good enough?
Store it at in a local sqlite database, flag unsynchronized items and create a synch process.
Kivy and python-for-android (also developed under the Kivy organization) should work well for this. You can build the sqlite3 module for a local database; of course, the functionality you want with syncing to server etc must be written. As for UI, it's pretty easy to get started with Kivy if you have Python knowledge. But if you want HTML/JS to reuse code or for other reasons, there is a webview bootstrap for python-for-android and a flask recipe. As far as I know that lets you build an app that is a flask server (running locally on android device) and a web frontend to communicate with it. I didn't try it, so no idea how complicated it is to use..
honestly Mathematica is just straight chaining of functions. I program in a 100% functional style with it (outside of some plotting stuff) and it seems to work pretty well. Plus you almost never have to write your own code if its anything related to mathematics (or some of the other hard sciences). I dont think i'd use it if it wasnt free for me though.
well the new tab completion is technically IPython, and is available in the classic notebook if you update it. 
What does it take to write click-bate titles like an expert!
I've tried it. It's not good enough.
is broken? Binder: ``` Found built image, launching... Launching server... Failed to create temporary user for gcr.io/binder-prod/r2d-fd74043jupyterlab-jupyterlab-demo:18a9793b58ba86660b5ab964e1aeaf7324d667c8 ```
Pythonic is a malleable thing. Some things are less malleable than others, but there are use cases for map and filter. Even if it's not considered pythonic, I still believe they're too useful in the situations that they're applicable in to ignore just because guido doesn't care for them. 
py-fortress RBAC using LDAP https://github.com/shawnmckinney/py-fortress
It's okay, and only for certain types of development. jedi-vim seems to autocomplete well for some modules (basically the standard library + simple stuff), and then choke on more advanced stuff like Django and Pandas. I found this a little frustrating, because Jedi autocompletes very well with the ipython3 shell (I think because it actually knows what each reference is from a live interpreter). For doing stuff with vim (basically remote server work where I can't start up an IDE), I pretty much have an ipython3 shell and vim going side by side, but it feels kind of hacky and I have to spend tons of time copy-and-pasting between windows (yes, I suck at vim, there's probably a better way of doing this).
and the things you didn't like?
Try that approach with numbers = [565656677463278, 4326473264867624] lol
This would be very cool! Thanks for the heads up!
That's wonderful! Thank you.
Really hoping to see JupyterLab support a variable explorer soon, a la Spyder, or Matlab
Science/engineering in the US. Unicode just isn't needed 99.9% of the time and when it is, it breaks everything. People learn to just avoid it. I'm the only one at my company that knows Python 3. I've been in two meetings with customers so far where the Python 3 question has come up. Everyone freaks out until I interrupt and say it's a non-issue and that it'll take me no more than a day to make the whole thing 2/3 compatible. It's pretty easy when it's 95% numpy and ASCII text. All I needed to do was use six for iteritems/itervalues/iterkeys, put parentheses around print, and a unicode to ASCII conversation to write a file for a Fortran program. Check out the graphs for downloads on numpy, scipy, matplotlib, pandas, sklearn. Jupyter and tensorflow don't show the same trend, but I think that somewhat makes sense given the packages focus on Python 3. &gt; https://rushter.com/blog/python-3-adoption/ The late adopters will switch when numpy/scipy drop support and not a day before. At least at my company, it's not even the fear of unicode (which it should be), it's the fear of print and division.
That all seems fair - could you feed that back to the Jupyter team? I mean, it's a beta, right? So this is the community's big opportunity to suggest usability tweaks before v1.
I watched 1 hour video on JupyterLab recently and was fascinated by the whole interface making me thinking about Mathematica which I could not afford and all the languages I have learned yet not mastering so far. I often wonder if at some point JupyterLab can also add node based interface. JupyterLab seems to be a great way to bridge all codes and it feels almost like an interface for browsing, coding, visualizing thing in realtime. Maybe it would even be a tool live in AR or VR. Maybe.
Sounds like you should see a doctor about your glucose levels. It's not normal to need food in order to concentrate. 
Why post [this same comment](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16420340) twice?
Again. No one here apparently understands what a fundamental equity valuation looks like if you think regression or machine learning will do anything. Everything is assumption based on an equity analyst or investment banking MD’s macro views relative to the closest compa. A fundamental model is building out the three financial statements and projecting what they will look like going forward. [An example of that is shown here with an operating model](http://macabacus.com/excel/templates/operating-model). You’re not going to build this out in python unless you plan on coding all the specific relationships that are specific to the company. Not every line item is used by each company and doing this in python would make you re-write the code every new company you wanted to model. Doing this in python makes literally no sense when there is a better specifically design tool (excel). If you want to aggregate different models for whatever quant analysis you want to do, you can always use xlwings to pull specific excel cells of data out into a python object. 
This is awesome! Going to make use of your site tonight - I've been working a bit in tkinter and I've been thinking about branching out to PyQt
Thanks for the post, hopefully folks will find it useful around here! Just out of curiosity, do you have a plan on distributing pyqt educational material that dives into more advanced aspects of the qt library, such as QML; QtTest (or pytest-qt), QtDeply, QMultimedia, drag-and-drop? I ask as I'm one of the two main devs for [TimeView](https://github.com/lxkain/timeview) and would love to take advantage of some of the more advanced features, but I often don't see qt/pyqt code outside of of the basics. Thanks again for posting/sharing!
Mathematica doesn't have casual users, just like Matlab doesn't have casual users. The target university students to learn their software and then industry that knows their software. Throw in a few amazing packages and you have a sale. Matlab does Simulink. Mathematica does integrals very, very well. We are a Python shop and bought Mathematica just for some nasty integrals.

I don't think anyone needs to be a Python expert. I think programmers should be really good at engineering solutions to problems, and they should be able to use whatever libraries and frameworks they need to. If that means learning how to write a few lines of some obscure programming language to use a certain library, so be it
The mental reward is the feeling you get when you figure out a solution to a problem.
I am not working directly with it. I am a professor, my research is done on super computers with lots of RAM and GPUs. But for prototype, I use my notebook. No need to buy another just to prototype =]
I'm new to Python so I started collecting interesting solutions and algorithms I learn solving problems at coding challenge sites. It has definitely sped up the learning process. One such is the following novelty that adds two integers using bitwise operators: def bitwise_add(a, b): while b: carry = a &amp; b a, b = a ^ b, carry &lt;&lt; 1 return a

Did you save python code into a Windows bat file? If yes, that's not going to work out. What you need to do is save that code in a Python file, something like passwordkeeper.py, you can then run the Python code through command line with python passwordkeeper.py email If you want to use a bat file, you can save this in a bat file then maybe add windows pause command after so the console does not immediately close.
We solve problems 1 and 3 with documentation or ducktyping. For documentation, you may enjoy [type hinting](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html). By ducktyping I mean we often write code that does not care if the value given is an int, long, or float. We asked for a duck, what we got quacks (has a numeric value), good enough. Problem 2 is not true, you can use the `help()` or `dir()` functions to find the attributes of an object. 
well, first of all, you stopped. second, it's just the word `IN` that you have to read. reading the other words will cancel the effect.
I would suspect some sort of karma-farming script that looks up Reddit posts in hacker news and copies the top comment. That or just manually copying comments. 
Learn the standard library inside out. There are some suprisingly usefull features in there waiting to be discovered, why re-invent the wheel. I would definitely recomend perusing functools, itertools, and operator.
You have to inform the file server about what you'll be doing next, get a response that server will actually accept it, etc, and doing it 5 times instead of 1 will always be slower. Also zipped files take up less space, that automatically means that it will take less time. 20KB means nothing, try downloading 100 images that are 1 MB each vs one zip file with 100 same images.
Nice meme.
Well I’m not calling the API 5 times, it’s once with 5 files. My very limited understanding was that when making an http request it would zip and unzip the data for you, though I’m not sure how accurate that is. Also, for the zip approach, I need to take jntk account the time it takes to zip the files on the client and unzip on the server. I’m looking at round trip performance.

That's a pretty helpful .vimrc you got [there](https://github.com/Rikorose/dotfiles/blob/master/vimrc), many a tasty wee snippet. Thanks
firstly, you need to have installed python 3 properly, which includes having it in the %PATH%. As far as I know, python scripts can't be run in the windows command line directly. A proper work around would be to save the contents of your code into a python file (ex. email.py) and let it be run by a batch file. 
flask if you like to make an easy to understand and minimalistic approach. Django if you want more possibilities included vanilla style. both can do very well in production and are fast. personally I'd like to recommend flask, if your project is a simple website, blog, restful api or something similar. Django for everything more.
Like @kazi1, I found python support to be fine in Vim until things got more complex. It got confused with Django, and that's 90% of what I'm messing with. Have you tried your set-up with Django, and if so, have you also tried PyCharm? I thought Vim was just a little bit from being great, and then I tried PyCharm, and I basically gave up hope of Vim ever catching up in the first hour of using it. No way I'm going to go spend another 8-hour day screwing around with Vim to try and get it tolerable again - if somebody has a .vimrc I can just load and try, though, I'd give it a shot.
isn't using python instead of javascript an advantage on itself? :D
&gt; Spyder has also been defunded I believe. Apparently so. That's unfortunate. It's still active though.
This is a great section from the article. &gt; you learn that the very logic on which (classical) computation is based, however intuitive it may seem, is nothing to be taken for granted: it is purely a man-made artifact, and nature needs not---in fact, does not---obey its rules. In this sense, quantum foundations tells us that classical computation is a model of computation that is artificially limited, just because we were not able to see beyond what is "obvious" to us.
How did SymPy compare? I know its results are often not pretty, but if all you're doing is putting it back into the code, then pretty doesn't matter. Or, did it just not solve it? 
I have a book for Java not Python sorry I was trying to run my first Python program I'll go get a book I guess...
Depends on a lot of things - primarily the hardware you're using (for how quickly you can zip your files), the compression ratios acheivable with your files and the details of your connection. Obviously if you have a terrible CPU but a magical 1tbps connection it'd be far faster to upload a few gigabytes rather than try to compress them first since the CPU would take much longer to compress the files than it'd take to upload them without compression. Inversely: if the connection is awful and slow with lots of dropped packets and your CPU is at least decent it'd be far better to upload with compression since you'd anticipate the network to be the bottleneck, therefore you optimize for performance there. If you have an all-around decent machine and connection, but your data only gets low compression ratios then it's likely better to upload sans compression - for apractical example: jpegs are already very compressed, don't compress them more, it's a waste of time. Alternately: very compressable files would quite likely benefit more from the compression. There isn't a general answer to this question, depends on factors.
Not necessarily trying to have people know exactly what M doing on my computer either so...
I wonder how RSudio makes money to sustain their operation...
I just want the graphics and cells, but with an emacs interface. Is that so wrong? Why am I left out in the cold?
So this has a lot to do with the size and the bandwidth. You would zip it, if the file is significantly big and the speed low or the cost of each call is high and cannot drop with concurrency. Rule of thumb, use multiprocesses, if the files are too many zip. If a file size goes above a theshold zip this file. 
&gt;[Make each program do one thing well. To do a new job, build afresh rather than complicate old programs by adding new "features".](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy) I don't think JupyterLab does that... Doesn't mean it has to be bad idea, but I certainly think it seems like one at first glance. 
Holy fucking shit 365 lines in one file without any classes or functions? That's just so bad.
OK I'm not sure why you posted here then if you don't want help?
Not sure why you thing I didint want help I posted a question lol...your telling me a simple command can't be fixed if a question is asked about it... Weird
It's not a simple command, it looks to be auto generated by something so the problem is likely to do with how it was auto generated rather than this code itself. What it is doing is opening a setup.py Python file from that `/private/var/.../fake-useragent/` location, reading the contents into variable `code`, closing the file, compiling and executing the contents of `code` with the parameters `install --record /var/folders/1z/1p1hp8116nsb7rw4dkgmhlqm0000gn/T/pip-UwkPaQ-record/install-record.txt --single-version-externally-managed --compile` This command fails with error code 1 which is "Operation not permitted". This could mean you need to run the command as superuser (`sudo ...`), or it could mean you don't have the right Python dependencies installed so `pip install --upgrade setuptools` may fix the problem. Without any context your question is the equivalent of driving into a mechanic shop in your car and telling him "something's wrong with it". He would need to know a lot more information before he could even begin looking for the problem.
I'm not an expert on micropython so don't know. The converter simply converts Python to RPN language, so the calculator (or emulator like Free42) is just running its native language. Check out Numworks https://www.numworks.com/ for a true MicroPython based calculator.
that would be really nice to have
I need to make some final alterations on this python script to use for a brute force attack
that'll be the day I completely migrate over!
I am... still waiting... will report back to you when complete. 
OK, [done](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/3911).
I think you have these issues because you try to force the java way onto python. You really need to embrace duck typing. Look into python iterators, for example. It will help you understand why we almost never need to check for the type. About the second point, python has deep introspection capabilities, I suggest you look into it, and come back to us if there's something you need help with.
&gt; This should scare Mathworks. It should, but there is a lot of inertia for Matlab. It is slowly changing though. I hear about other companies in my industry largely laughing off Python for being too slow. It's just as fast as Matlab... We largely switched off Matlab 10+ years ago, but we still pay for 2 licenses. We even developed a better (though more limited) signal processing library to replace the signal processing library to avoid the $15k or whatever their license cost is up to these days. Still, that's better than 20 seats. I'm curious to see if there's a variable explorer like Matlab like there was in Spyder. In my mind is Matlab's "killer feature" outside of Simulink, is that it's not a really a "real" programming language. It's more of a shell in that respect.
Sympy just doesn't solve a lot of integrals. I'm talking some of the nastiest integrals I've ever seen, where a transformation of variables can change the answer (it's some weird property of `tan(u+v)=(tan(u)+tan(v))/(1-tan(u)tan(v))`). That's independent of whether you're doing it in sympy or by hand. You see these nasty integrals in potential flow analysis. They're much worse when you're doing unsteady potential flow analysis. It might be related to sympy not understanding limits, but presumably they understand pi. And yeah, while it's nice for results to be pretty, I just want the answer. I should get those equations at some point, obfuscate them, and report a bug to sympy. One less reason...
Is there a question here? It looks like it already does bruteforcing
What about [SageMath](http://www.sagemath.org/)?
Yeah, I just loved that a person actually came up with a reasonable solution to the expert design meeting.
They don't mention it here, but there's some videos floating around. One of the bigger goals are support for multi-user installations and collaborative projects. It's been doable in a somewhat hacky way through Jupyterhub, but it's had a lot of problems. 
All sound like good points, and I suspect that some of these may get addressed in coming updates. 
yes, it needs some additional tweaks and i'm unsure of what needs adding or changing
I'm following [this](http://ageof.info/setting-up-twitter-bot-with-python-and-tweepy) to help me make my bot :D
You missed my point. Most people don't use Matlab proper as a programming language, not that it isn't or not that you can't pay a ton of money and buy a toolbox that can convert your Matlab code to C++ or that you can link into C++ without paying a dime just like Python. Most people don't write functions; they just use premade ones. They're writing 100 line scripts and then saving their history to solve a very specific problem. The fact that capability is so built into the IDE is a feature.
@/u/tunisia, Thanks for your reply.. I do use `pytest` but didnt know about _fixtures_. Thanks for pointing this out. I just read the fixtures page on `pytest`. This is really cool way to access data. Most of the time needed to access the data for the unittests right now goes to opening up the `.rrf` and `.xlsx` file using `xlwings`. If I can use the same `test` data, this will speed up the tests a lot. I will use this as I add more unit-tests. To your point about using `.csv` files: I actually simplified the above description a bit. The source file say `file1.xlsx` is actually a `.rrf` file which is generated by a pretty old software. This is similar to a `.csv` file with comma separated text based data. But I do access it using Excel using `xlwings` library, mainly to reduce how many libraries I need to learn and use. But `pandas` is probably a better way to read this file, but it will require some refactoring. I have added this to my `todo` list. The database to which I enter the data say `file2.xlsx` is a Excel file. After the data analysis, the data has be formatted so that people can pretty much copy paste into `Powerpoint`. I do this using `xlwings` in a automated fashion, which is a significant part of the automation. If I use a `csv` file, I will probably lose the formatting. My fear was mainly based on the common assumption that `xlsx` files get corrupted, even though I personally haven't had this issue in the last year or so. _I am curious to know why do you think `xlsx` format is bad?_ SQLite is a great suggestion. I will use it going forward. One way to acheive a preformatted and analyzed data while using a database to store most of the data would be split the data into 2 parts. After extracting the data from the `.rrf` file, I can clean the data and then put it into a SQLite database. I can then analyze the cleaned up data, and create the final parameters and format them using xlwings and only put the formatted data into the `.xlsx` file. _Do you think thats a reasonable compromise, or is there a better solution?_
I think the case for Mathematica was a lot stronger (say) 10 years ago. There were fewer competitors for visualisation, sophisticated maths libraries and the notebook experience. Nowadays ... well, Wolfram somehow stays in business, I'm not sure how. 
As I said before. &gt; In my mind is Matlab's "killer feature" **outside of Simulink**, is that it's not a really a "real" programming language. 
Give pipsi a try. It's a wrapper around virtualenv and pip which installs scripts provided by python packages into separate virtualenvs and then symlinks all new scripts into ~/local/bin. Now before someone repeats the oft quoted assertion that Windows doesn't support symlinks, have a look at issue 107 where pfmoore developed a work around which resulted in the use of json files. There was some back and forth acceptance of various pull requests so I don't know where it stands. I'm a Nix user so I can't test it for you at present. Have a go at it and if you don't mind letting me know if it works, I'd appreciate this. Saves me from having to fire up a vm to try it myself. Your script, however, must be rolled up into a pypi compatable package,
I would like to contribute! Im also learning and no expert by any means, but interested in RL :) 
Ok, so u r trying to run code from automate the boring stuff book. And I think you have missed a paragraph or appendix B. Let’s see how it is mentioned there . So now u have saved ur pw. py. Lets assume u saved it at C:\mypythonscript folder. Step1:- add this path to the environment folder Step2:- create a .bat file at this location and Dave following in it @py.exe C:\mypythonscript\pw.py /* @pause Save this file as py.bat Step 3 :- WIN-R and type py email You will be able to get the info
And it has collapsible cells!!!
Probably there were 0 results. You're doing the number of search results - 1. You can't call randint with (0, -1).
these are the helpers i like to keep around in my big python-testing project i have in pycharm: https://gist.github.com/sharkbound/07979c90e161388c09c2f7848e550c7f
Interesting. I haven't really thought about potential flow since the first year of grad school, but I thought it always assumed steady state. Now I need to go back to my notes...
It's an IDE, so naturally if you're philosophically opposed to IDEs then it's not for you. Unix philosophy is a guideline, not a religion. 
Does this have any new features geared towards more collaborative notebooks? It's a bit of a pain where I'm at, with no central jupyter server, to share and collaborate on notebooks. 
Sorry, I don't think I was clear in my initial post. I was asking if a python library existed that could do something similar to: http://www.jsonschema2pojo.org Except for kotlin data object instead of pojos. I know there are libraries that do it for java, I was just wondering if there was a similar python one. 
Sage (now called SageMath) utilizes over 100 open source libraries, including SymPy. Here is a SageMath page on symbolic integration: http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/calculus/sage/symbolic/integration/integral.html As documented, there are several libraries that can be used to do integration - symPy, Maxima (the default), FriCAS, Giac and - you're going to love this - MATHEMATICA! &gt;... just use algorithm=’mathematica_free’ to integrate via Mathematica &gt;over the internet (does NOT require a Mathematica license!) Nice, eh? :-) 
I should at some point. I need to clean up my vim setup before anything like that though. 
Agreed. I’d rather see more portability and less lock in. Why are we reinventing the text editor? I’ve been trying the VSCode + Jupyter extension lately. Decent vim bindings and rendering. I don’t see myself leaving that one any time soon.
If I change it to len(searchResults) + 1 it gives me an IndexError: list index out of range
Consider `random.choice()` for choosing an element from a list. And handle the case where the list is empty.
It's because they go against philosophy of there should be one and only one thing to do it. There's nothing map/filter can do that comprehension can't but there are things comprehension can do but map/filter can't. Also you shouldn't teach people unpythonic code no matter what personal opinions you have. 
Simply add time.sleep() inside your scraping method?? 
&gt;What the fuck kind of casual user can afford Mathematica anyway? The sort who sails upon the high seas?
So how does this compare to JetBrains PyCharm? That is the only IDE I have used.
I'm just going to save everyone the click (and take a hit away from the OP), since the OP literally made their account only to post the link. I'll add in some commentary along the way. &gt;1. Dynamically Typed Language Who goes out and learns a language just because it's dynamically-typed? &gt;2. Simple Syntax I'll give you this one. Python literally reads like pseudocode. And there are [variations](http://jon.how/likepython/) out there that make it even more like verbal pseudocode. &gt;3. English-like commands Just like literally every other language out there with an English localization &gt;4. One-liners Just like every other language out there. &gt;5. Used in web development Java, PHP, and SQL are much better languages to learn if you want to do webdev. &gt;6. Used in artificial intelligence So is literally every other lanugage &gt;7. Used in scientific computing, data mining, and machine learning. Can confirm, do scientific computing. The issue here is that most scientists and engineers aren't trained in best practices, so if you want to re-use code someone else in your field has used, be prepared for uncommented spaghetti. &gt;8. Big Data R &gt;9. Large standard library So does Java and .NET. &gt;10. Large community Like most languages
Again, `searchResults` is empty. You **can't** randomly select an entry from an empty list. Where is `searchResults` getting it's values? Your code doesn't show that. 
Puzzle @ https://app.finxter.com/learn/computer/science/402
Tab indentation too. That script is terrifying.
I learnt to use Github, and create README.md There are some issue with it, though; mostly things like large files, and forgetting to add .gitignore For an easier one, maybe just share a Dropbox folder -- no problems like file size limit... https://github.com/patarapolw
This appears to be for a very specific usage/subset of JSON someone came up with called "jsonschema". I doubt there's going to be anything well-maintained that can target Kotlin, but you can [try searching with that keyword](https://pypi.python.org/pypi?%3Aaction=search&amp;term=json+schema&amp;submit=search).
Of now, I am more interested in how to distribute an app, like py2app or PyInstaller. This is more of a problem when I try to turn [QtWebEngine/Web-app into a desktop app](https://polvcode.wordpress.com/2018/02/14/python-web-py-turning-website-into-a-desktop-app/). (TBH, I even try to deviate from Python to Electron.js)
If anyone still interested in doing FA (not TA) with Python, here are some directions: (1) Getting basic Company Info, from some free online data provider (2) Downloading earning report each quarter, and extract useful data (revenue, cost, opex, etc) (3) Extracting any public alternative data related to the company, if available (4) Automate finance model building with help of Python (5) Generate reports for fundemental analyst
Also look at the nvim configuration: https://github.com/Rikorose/dotfiles//master/config/nvim/init.vim
A simpler solution would be to stop at 3:47, agree with the lady, document the exact request of the company and recreate it to a T.
The best advice I ever got, was start practising at codewars.com. It also makes you quickly realize that you're not that smart really. https://www.codewars.com/
&gt; i'm unsure of what needs adding or changing so even if we *could* somehow magically read your mind, that still wouldn't be enough?
It searches for a specific string within any (theoretically) public tweet. It turns out, I had a multitude of things not lined up correctly: I had my account private, the string I was searching was specific to my account so no results were showing, and more. Thank you for your time! I got the bot working to my specifications for this current version.
The other app to consider using is 'click' by Armin Ronacher. It will setup your python scripts to run from the command line without having to type python3 my_script.py. Works on Windows as well.

Except generators are much more powerful and you end up with code that uses both. The philosphy of "one and only way" is a good philosphy and is there for a reason. &gt; It's also easier to explain to coworkers that aren't as familiar with Python Really? It's good because people who don't know python can understand it? Lets get rid of all python idioms then! Also you can argue that comprehensions have much cleaner glance value as they are explicit and don't require any mental gymnastics. They are literally just for loops which is core of any programming language. I think you are wrong and not only that you are convinced on teaching other people bad python.
It’s not homework and I haven’t asked anyone to do it or I would have wrote a transcript of it.
Mate, whether you're right or wrong doesn't matter. What matters is that you're being a complete twat about it.
Been contributing on github for ages and this is really the first time I have ever heard of Github Projects. I've encountered some custom disccusion boards on youtrack, redmine or trello but 99% of the time people just stick to discussing things under issues, pull requests or irc.
Darn it! I wish I had heard about that a few days ago! Well... At least with this you get a few other things like type conversions and an autogenerated usage string (the first line).
I tried to use the project boards a few times and mostly got annoyed at how manual the flow to use them feels. However GitHub has added [more automation](https://help.github.com/articles/about-automation-for-project-boards/) to them, so it may be time to try again.
USB lock for my computer. Python locks the system until a USB is inserted with a specific key. Still trying to decide the best way to do it, though. Is the key going to pass through a checksum evaluater? Will the key decrypt a pickled function and break a while-loop? Is the key really just a function that sends a socket packet to a specific port? The world may never know!
What a *darn* shame.. *** ^^Darn ^^Counter: ^^451977
&gt; Except generators are much more powerful and you end up with code that uses both. Show me how to partial a generator expression without reinventing map. &gt; The philosphy of "one and only way" is a good philosphy and is there for a reason. There are four ways to do string formatting, six if you count the + and join methods on string. &gt; Really? It's good because people who don't know python can understand it? Lets get rid of all python idioms then! That's a heck of a strawman you built there. &gt; Also you can argue that comprehensions have much cleaner glance value as they are explicit and don't require any mental gymnastics. They are literally just for loops which is core of any programming language. They are clearer in *most but not all* situations. I'm not saying comprehensions are bad and should be avoided. &gt; I think you are wrong and not only that but you are convinced on teaching other people bad python. Clearly you've never worked with me or known my coworkers or any of the people I collaborate with. I'm not perfect by any means and there are things in codebases that I'm ashamed of, but I'd like to think that I've never purposefully taught someone a bad practice. At any rate, https://github.com/justanr I await your PRs to fix my unpythonic code. 
Keep your feelings in your asshole, no pun intended :)
You could store your data in an HTML5 local WebSQL database - some client libraries already exist to sync these to server side databases: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1744522/best-way-to-synchronize-local-html5-db-websql-storage-sqlite-with-a-server-2
I'm particularly excited about real-time collaboration. The feature is currently under development.
Yes?
 spaceship = [ " |###|\n" " | |\n" " |###|\n" " /| | |\ \n" "|----|----|\n" ] for part in spaceship: print(part) To align vertically, you need to add spaces so that it prints some whitespace before characters, to stack them on top of eachother, you use newline character `\n`.
Same for me 
&gt;Django-hotsauce 0.9.0 is out. Have fun! Yup, that's all that there is when you click the link.

I hear that about packaging a lot. I've packaged a few apps up cross-platform, including ones using complicated python libraries. Once it's working it's pretty easy, by it takes a while to get there. Will do a write-up of this soon.
If it's just me working on a project I just use a text file of ordered tasks to decide what to work on next. I usually keep it checked into the repo. I still use github issues but that's just for communication with other people - raising bugs, discussions, etc.
One thing I'm eagerly awaiting is [raise_for_status will finally be chainable / expressive](https://github.com/requests/requests/pull/3868). Currently, if you want to assert the status is in range(200, 400) you need a local variable and three *statements* (assign response to variable, call `raise_for_status()`, actually get relevant data from response) so you can't just work with it in e.g. a lambda, etc… In 3.0, `raise_for_status` *finally* returns `self`.
One thing I've wanted to do is subclass the standard library's Exceptions class to print a random line of poetry instead of the standard error message when an exception is raised. I don't know if that counts.
I deal with this by dropping an import IPython ; IPython.embed() wherever I want to take a look around and see what's up. You can use that to dynamically (while the code is running) inspect return types, find available methods using tabbed autocomplete, get variable types and run code on the fly. This is my IDE equivalent. This is a bit of a paradigm change from a lot of statically typed languages where people have sophisticated IDEs that tell them things about their code and the idea of experimenting with a REPL is not common. You don't strictly *need* tests to do this (fire up django runserver and clicking about a bit works too) but it helps a lot. I tend to find that statically typed languages are a bit easier to work with if you have code without tests but once you have a decent level of test coverage dynamically typed languages are just as easy to work with.
I expect my users to have the capacity to use Google to seek out more informations about django-hotsauce. :) Anyways, thanks for your input! 
Thanks! This is exactly what I'm looking to do. Are you aware of any tutorials or guides that could walk me through steps 1-5? Thanks again!
Why not using pickle?
I used to use issues, currently I don't use them at all (they are there in case someone spots a bug, though). For managing the project, I use notepad-todo apps (CherryTree on PC and Orgzly on mobile).
You are doing the right thing in testing your options as there could be many things that affect the transfer. You could try no-zip vs normal zip vs most compressed zip on the minimum-sized data, maximum sized data; minimum number of individual files vs maximum number; ... Tabulate it all and go with the data ... 
I dont think there is any single tutorial can provide all the guidance of Step 1-5. (1) Need to understand webscraping. https://blog.hartleybrody.com/guide-to-web-scraping/ (2) Need to operate with docx/pdf/excel, as well as basic NLP for information extraction. Python with Docs: https://automatetheboringstuff.com/chapter13/ NLP: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfoudtpBV68&amp;list=PL4LJlvG_SDpxQAwZYtwfXcQr7kGnl9W93 (3) This one is very tricky, but typically a combination of webscraping/data extraction if you are not working in institution and not buying data from vendor (4) Financial Modeling and Valuation, here are two introductory texts: https://www.amazon.co.uk/Investment-Banking-University-Second-Acquisitions/dp/1118472209 https://www.bookdepository.com/Investment-Valuation-Aswath-Damodaran/9781118130735 (5) Well, if you know how to do (1) to (4), (5) should be now a piece of cake 
Try to use a linter in your code, it gives useful hints 
Yeah. That's one of the reasons I made it simply return an ArgumentParser instance. It's a really mature and powerful tool, so it's best to work alongside it. Of course, there's still the overhead of adding another dependency for something as trivial as argument parsing, but in this case, it's an extremely small overhead.
Multiple reasons here but mainly because the company I work for asked me to use msgpack. 
It's called "code golfing" as u/fiddle_n pointed out. It's fun to do, especially with the challenges on DailyProgrammer (subreddit, don't know the exact name).
Check out github.com/pyviz/labmode it's very early in development but it's exactly that. 
Is it production ready? 
Just a minor little thing I spotted: &gt; range(0, self.b_size) That's the same as range(self.b_size)
Not exactly clear why this is on /r/python, except maybe you saw the `"""` marks and thought it would be useful?
To quote The Zen of Python: &gt; Simple is better than complex. &gt; Complex is better than complicated. It's super fun to try to express yourself as briefly as possible, but it's not always good practice. If I saw your example in my codebase, you'd be very, very banned.
Sorry, should have been /r/programming, so I'll post it there instead.
It's in the [tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#class-objects) Seriously, read it from start to finish. It is well written. And BTW, you are looking for r/learnpython
Thanks, I’ll have a further look into it.
Thanks for this great collection. I'll definetely give it a closer look asap.
Until you have no access to the internet. Thank God for git.
Sorry I do not feel comfortable uploading my code online, is there another way?
Well, I found a solution (see [here](http://ix.io/NpI/py)) The trick is to encode the contained type in the container encoded dict. There might be a better looking approach (if so, I'd love to know about it) but it works for me as long as the user (me) does not insert elements of other (incompatible) types.
Tkinter is a module for GUI applications. Django is a web framework. So, no, you don't have to know Tkinter to learn django.
 if cert_obj_json == "": return # non-empty certificate. Let’s continue! ... if not status_change_to: return # no status change. Bye! # let’s change status: ... This type of if is sometimes referrred to as a guard - ensure that a certain condition is valid for any code beyond that point. This kind of code is easy to follow because the current execution position is a context where certain things are known to be valid. Putting if/returns in deeply nested loops and ifs can be confusing, but keeping them at the top level this way is good. - 
Knowing how to use Tkinter will not benefit you in Django land, at all.
Thank you man
Thanks bro
This is a funny question, the answer is technically, no. Practically, kind of. Django itself is a web framework, it's for building websites. Generally (but not always) Django is used to produce HTML which can be viewed in a web browser. So Django accepts HTTP requests, and responds with HTML. So, technically speaking, Django doesn't give you any ability to create a GUI. Practically, you can use Django to create a website, and view that website in a web browser (the web browser is the GUI) and have your users interact with your application through that. It's up to you to decide if your project would be better if your application would be better suited as a web app, than as a local desktop app.
&gt; Sure, existing users would care to know that the new version is out. But they'd also probably care about what changed, to know if they care about upgrading, and with no changelog the post is still useless to even your existing users. And that's to say nothing about people who aren't currently users of your software, but could be if you provided more information in your post about what your software does. Dude, i really don't care if you dont know anything yet about advanced web programming in Python. It is not my job to educate you about modern django programming and why you should already know this. I'm only announcing the availability of django-hotsauce to my users. If you want a tutorial check out: https://www.isotopesoftware.ca/documentation/django-hotsauce/handbook/getting-started.html 
&gt; I am an old-school dev Not really an excuse bro... Forget thinking of GIT as decentrelized, and use it with GitLab/GitHub the same way you would use Subersion.
This article does a number of, um, questionable things. The ones that stood out to me: * Python doesn't really have constants. By convention, names in `ALL_CAPS` are probably not meant to change, but they're still just variables. * Python style ([PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)) generally uses `snake_case` names rather than `camelCase` for variables. * Python 'character literals' are still string literals. Just, with only one character. **Edit**: more, why not? * The first two examples use curly quotes for string literals. Python won't like that. * The second example uses C++-style `//` comments (??) * It claims Python is a type-inferred language, which is (at best!) extremely misleading. Oh man every time I look at it I see something new.
Thanks bro :)
I can create a private repo if needs be also.
Very bad code. First of all, a generator expression would have been better than using list comprehension, but, more importantly, the algorithm doesn’t properly handle wrap around: what is `decrypt(‘A’)`?
Ah yes.... thats the next step. Or rather what I am actually doing with the data. I need to save the files for archival purposes. The other idea I had was to just throw them in a directory and then use cron to gz them.
Just some silly Twitter stuff again. People are obsessed!
I'd definitely recommend adding `type(thing)` before you output the repr.
Yes, it is, including simple minification of units, as of version 3.6.101
&gt;Exception handling is not error handling, you will not use exception for something you can check for example if you divide x/y , check that y is not zero using if statement and not using exceptions This is straight-up advocating [Look Before You Leap](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-lbyl). A bad idea when the condition might be changed between the time of check and the time of use. https://docs.quantifiedcode.com/python-anti-patterns/readability/asking_for_permission_instead_of_forgiveness_when_working_with_files.html 
Will you use exception handling while divide x by y???
Browsers are good tech. Just abuse them instead of making a custom GUI yourself. Plus python with ajax very much rocks.
cron+compression is almost what logrotate is built for. Might be worth a look. 
read through the tutorial and use that as a guide.
Very true. Something you can drop-in as one or two python modules is nice. Good benefit for the cost.
Are you ok?
maybe, divide by 0 is an **exceptional** circumstance, and what you want to happen in that case is probably different from all your other divisions
You can pick up Python very quickly by doing the Django tutorials. However, it'll definitely help if you have programming background. I picked up Python by starting Django. Takes time. Read through all the topics after the tutorial and you'll master Python in no time.
Ten obscure open source projects
A post named "Python for the Web" introduced me to "Fire" and I'm converting all my argparse, docopt, etc. to Fire. Check it out and you may not want to use these anymore. https://github.com/google/python-fire 
In the above paragraph I mean that if you can easily check something do it instead of try - except. I didnt mean files handling or databases etc. 
Yes, absolutely.
Thanks for confirming. Can you point me to the correct python term for this? I’ve been googling but I don’t quite get the results I need to read about how to do this. Thanks again.
To the correct term for what exactly? Parsing command line arguments?
Sure. Many python packages have command line entry-points. `pip` is one of these! There are two key components to a command line tool written in Python: the `setup.py` file which defines the entry point and the function(s) which is invoked when the tool is used from the command line. For example with `pip`, [these lines in the setup.py](https://github.com/pypa/pip/blob/master/setup.py#L77-L82) and the [function those lines point to](https://github.com/pypa/pip/blob/master/src/pip/_internal/__init__.py#L219) which can parse command line arguments are what essentially gives `pip` its ability to be called from the command line like pip install &lt;package name&gt; You can also call the same code from python directly like import pip args = ['install', 'requests'] pip.main(args) So, in a similar way, you can write a `main` function that can accept arguments from the command line. You can use tools like `argparse`, `click`, `fire`, and others to help you parse arguments, provide usage help options, and more. There are a few guides out there on this, I'm sure you can find them with a quick google search on 'Python command line entry points'
Why not use the built-in support for custom/extended types? https://pypi.python.org/pypi/msgpack#packing-unpacking-of-custom-data-type
I guess including what the project does in the readme is purely optional

You don't need much. I'd recommend going through the Django tutorial - if you know a little Python, you'll be able to follow along.
Really? I found dozens of projects after 2 minutes of checking github to validate what you've just said. 
Variables, functions, classes, conditionals, loops, modules and packages.
