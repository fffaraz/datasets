It's great that you are creating and learning but it would be preferable if you shared some images and/or source code as well instead of a rar file with an exe in it. Not all people would trust and run some random file off the internet like this.
1. /r/learnpython 2. Nothing is ever "compiled" in Python, everything is created at runtime. You can declare lists or other variables at any point in your code, including inside conditionals.

I really like projects like this and me myself did plenty of those...but after a while i always ask myself...why did i do that? xD
 [https://github.com/Fengax/Handwritten-Number-Classifier](https://github.com/Fengax/Handwritten-Number-Classifier)
I consider myself as an intermidiate programmer. The way I found to improve myself was to find a useful project ("Useful" is the keyword here) that will keep you motivated. I'm currently working on a Python project where I wanted to implement SQL and Tkinter (Module to create GUIs, by default in Python) to store a large amount of data for a game I play and display them. That way, I wont need to refer to the website for the data, Ill have them in my application, displayed the way I want. The point is: Find something that motivates you (Games, website development, GUI development, artificial intelligence, medical, etc) and create something useful FOR YOU.
okay, i want to do auto clicker, how do i start? if i look in youtube ill end up just copying it do you have any advice on how to start without just copying? because right now i have no idea how to do it
The lack of libraries is key for me. Not just regarding Julia but another language I like is Nim but once again you have no depth of libraries.
Oh I can upload it to GitHub or smth of you wanna see, it's not anywhere atm :p
Yeah I have this problem too. You can call just use “python3 -m pip install packagenamehere”
I got some projects of my own with a fair number of stargazers; you might want to check out * [quadpy](https://github.com/nschloe/quadpy) (numerical integration) * [orthopy](https://github.com/nschloe/orthopy) (orthogonal polynomials) * [meshio](https://github.com/nschloe/meshio) (mesh format conversion) * [betterbib](https://github.com/nschloe/betterbib) (BibTeX improvements)
Wow! Congrats on the hard work. It looks like magic to me 😀. How long did it take you?
Poor javascript
In my experience, most of the slow Python codes can be fixed by using numpy methods (which use BLAS at the core). Especially in the scientific context, it often comes down to properly vectorizing your code. Saying that here because I feel this is often underappreciated.
You do realise that mnist in jpegs is in no way better then the "compressed" data that you can get from keras.datasets? It's just extra space for something that is already there really
It does do it, you just have to give black some indication that it's Python 3.6+. Use an f-string in the code somewhere, for example, or just provide the `--py36` command-line option.
If your code bottleneck is in your own Python code, you're probably doing something wrong. The slowest parts of your scientific code should be where the number crunching happens, i.e., dot-products, matrix-vector products etc. Obviously no change in Python 2-vs-3 performance since the computation happens in the backend (BLAS or so).
how did you achieve this year 2000 laggy application window line style while drawing ?
Great start but there are alot of things you could do to make your code faster smaller cleaner and therefore better The first thing is just using the "compressed" dataset rather then your jpeg solution as there is literally no difference apart from the extra processing time to convert the images into numpy arrays and the raw size of the file Try using keras.datasets.mnist The way you make your model is also a bit weird, why are you using for loops to put layers into your network. You aren't using an insane ammount of layers so it is only logical to just manually put them into your model. This would allow for other people to see the structure of your model without having to download and run your code. A side note, I often see people using the following code: ``` model = keras.models.Sequential() model.add(a) model.add(b) model.add(c) ``` When there is a much more readable and simpler way of doing it ``` model = keras.models.Sequential([ a, b, c ]) ``` It just kind of triggers me when I see the first option even though it's industry standard essentially but it's totally fine to do it that way It does seem like your code is very bloated for what it does so there is some room to improve but this is an amazing start If you want to further your ml skills I'd reccomend trying the Titanic prediction challenge on kaggle
I am not OP, but if I would guess, a few hours for learning and writing the 150 lines of code. 5 hours for finding /classifying the training data, 1 hour to let it train, 20 min to write the read me
Sublime Text 3 https://www.sublimetext.com/
I'm working on a school management system that's made from python. But I have some help on the gui. What's language should I include for the gui?
I actually already use quadpy, although I haven’t looked a whole lot at the source code. It’s been super useful for me for generating quadrature rules so I really appreciate it! I will probably need to have orthogonal polynomials on the triangle at some point - I assume orthopy will be good for that, seeing as SciPy seems to only deal with Legendre polynomials in one dimension.
Do a video capture tool next so you don't have to use your phone to record... 🤦‍♂️
"Viola" is the simple past (~preterit), "violé" is the past participle.
`list = []`
&gt; Nothing is ever "compiled" in Python Everything(?) is compiled in Python. It's just compiled into byte-code, not native machine instructions. That's why there's a built-in function called "compile", and .pyc files which contain compiled byte-code. Even when you pass a text string directly to `exec` or `eval`, it gets compiled to byte-code before execution.
That's so specific 😂😂
Thank you for sharing
Yeah, i can write a code, but i can't capture a video.
&gt; It takes some effort to understand what the code is doing. Some day I hope to see code that takes no effort to understand. &gt; This will make the code less readable. Less readable to who?
Very cool! Thanks for sharing
Is it a deadlock or has it just not been flushed?
I get the feeling OCR is the equivalent to hello world in neural nets.
Agreed. People compare python to MATLAB and R, but it's not a good comparison. MATLAB is a linear algebra package, with general scripting tagged on as an afterthought. R is a statistics package, with general scripting tagged on as an afterthought. Python is a general purpose language, which can do both linear algebra and statistics very nicely, among practically everything else, with libraries.
&gt; During runtime, if some conditions are satisfied, it creates a list of a particular name, as how I want it, and then I can work with it. if condition: particular_name = [] # an empty list particular_name = [1, 2, 3, 4] # a list of four numbers particular_name = ["hello", "world"] # a list of two strings
It won't work as well, but try SVM on the dataset. See how it performs versus your simple NN. try other techniques... There are plenty with different performances based on the dataset given. I think learning them all (and the math behind it) is a good way to truly get into ML. disclaimer: I just started studying ML, and the my comment is not an expert one however if you're diving into ML I recommend the following: https://elitedatascience.com/learn-machine-learning Skip the python introduction as it seems you have a good grasp on that.
I don’t have an direct answer to your question but I thought you should know that google maps have an API access that can be used directly. So you don’t have to scrap it from the web. You would have to pay a fee for heavy commercial access but it will likely be cheaper and much easier than scraping all the info you need. Web scraping can be very resource intensive. https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/?&amp;sign=0
MNIST digit recognition, perhaps, but OCR as a whole is not an entirely solved problem.
:o
Very nice
This is great, how about adding memory usage information as well?, That would be neat.
Geeze, meanwhile I'm having trouble with just radio buttons
Docopt really needs to fix some bugs though. It’s unfortunately dead. After years of fighting docopt bugs, I switched to argparse. I also hacked the argparse print method to dump my docopt message.
I was expecting 69 or 420 by the end, to be honest Awesome job, good work :)
How does it cope with habdwritten letters? Does it try to guess a most similar number or fail?
Does `rq` not use `redis`' persistence modes?
Masterchief
Every expert was once a novice. We all have to learn radio buttons at some point. Keep at it!
This is pretty cool OP, how long did it take you?
[removed]
Not Hello World, but definitely an early exercise. It's a nice problem; it's real work and not just a toy, it's a good scale, and the MNIST data set is a standard we can all easily use.
A software than visually shows how multiple documents are linked to one another. My initial focus will be excel spreadsheets, then other document formats as well. The idea is to assist people who use tons of documents all self referencing each other by showing them a visual depiction of their relationships. Like a "social map", but replacing people with docs.
...and vastly more fun than Link's crossbow training.
But it sure does give a good morale boost to new learners.
Yup. Nintendo has a certain history of protecting their IP (not w/out reason) to insane degrees. It's a shame, but understandable.

Do you have a Windows port available?
Great feedback!
/r/learnpython Make sure that your python and ipython binaries are both associated with that virtual environment. It might be that there is no ipython in your virtualenv, so it reaches out to somewhere else on your path to get an ipython associated with some other environment (like the system environment). Check this with `which python` and `which ipython`.
I think this is mostly from the generic function names I used in the example. In context, the values and names are fairly clear. Also, there is no need for a container. The output from the previous function is the input for the next. Normally I would use simple composition, but in this case the function list isn't known until runtime.
I really like this! Even in my op I was saying it was a reverse reduce(), it just didn't occur to me to use a lambda to switch the order!
General OCR can get quite hard, but what OP has done is in fact EXACTLY equivalent to Hello World in neural networks, but with lots of extra steps. Using MNIST to classify handwritten digits is so unbelievably easy I cannot understand how this can get 97% upvoted. Have only 3% of Python programmers ever touched neural networks?
That is not a Decimal type, it's an int. &gt;&gt;&gt; import math &gt;&gt;&gt; n = math.factorial(10000) &gt;&gt;&gt; type(n) &lt;class 'int'&gt; &gt; Since the maximum integer that can be stored on a 64 bit architecture it's about 20 digits of length That is true from a hardware perspective, and many programming languages copy that truth into the language, but it's not true in python. A python int can be any size, and has perfect precision.

Every week? More like 10 times in 5 years - from experience.
Thanks. This is what i was looking for. I didn't knew from shere start.
A super simple command-line app to manage projects (tasks, deadlines etc.).
Ridiculous. Awesome.
Ahh yes, me any my co-authors who never read a word of the paper.
This is great, good job.
do u mean a windows version of that program ? if that is your question im gonna make the windows version soon
Yes. All good points and all the first things I checked. I’m OS X if it might make a difference
Scraping Google Maps would be pretty challenging, as they take numerous measures to prevent it. They instead provide a (pretty costly) API for you to query these results. Help your manager understand that this is not a one time job, since every time Google adds a new prevention measure, your code must be updated. In just a couple months, any script that isn't constantly updated would be close to useless.
Not sure what you want. Do you want to crop the images to 600x600? Do you want to shrink the image so their larger dimension is 600px, then add a letterbox? Do you want to shrink the image so their smaller dimension is 600px, then crop the rest? Do you want to squash the image so that it fits into 600x600? &amp;#x200B; Obviously you can't convert a non-square image into a square without doing one of the above.
That's not even a course. It's a 4.5 hour long video, and covers only the absolute basics. It's a good start, but you need to learn much more. I would say that your next step should be learning from this tutorial: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html
Not that I'm aware of!
Probably close to correct actually. All my coworkers and friends know at least some python if not use it professionally. None have touched NN. It's not only used for data science ;)
This is great! Did you follow a tutorial, or figure this out on your own? I would love to dive into this!
Thank you!!! That worked splendidly :D
Datacamp. a bit expansive but worth it.
I am glad it helped, good luck in your future projects!
Thank you.... Yea, that's what "port" means.
Start creating real programs. That's where the actual learning happens.
ok next week the windows version will be done and shared here
Counter point. Reading in the data from a JPEG is a great way to start out. It enforces the understanding of what the data set really is. Sure, in production, it's better to use more efficient methods. When learning, understanding should be the goal, not efficiency. On that note, if /r/RedManBrasil is interested in a next step, coding the algorithms could be interesting. No libraries other than Numpy. That would reinforce the knowledge of the forward pass, activate functions, loss, back propagation, etc....
You never forget your first time
Would it really be that hard ? A guy that used to work at my company made a list with all the restaurants in Germany - names, address, coordinates using the Google Places API. I took a look at it recently since I will have to do the same and the guy didn't leave his code. It looked like it would take a few days to figure out, but not that hard in general.
Everyone starts somewhere.
If its larger squash to 600 and if its smaller then stretch while keeping aspect ratio
If you go to edX there's two part class from MIT that uses python to teach computer science. This will get you to understand programming in python a little better as well as expose you to computer science concepts.
/r/redmanbrasil doesn't seem to exist.
I did something similar the other day with pygame. https://gist.github.com/JonnoFTW/5f0a7e5f5f7f0b7b939702b4230a2d6d
I didn't know there is framework called CherryPy. Where is Flask, which is the most popular for light weight microservice development, lambda functions, etc? Are Django that popular today when we have dedicated front-end SPAs (React/vue/Angular) and dedicated backend (micro/monolithic services)? In Python based services I see more Flask, or async based frameworks and less on Django DRF.
What about double digits? If you put 13 would it print out "one" "three" or "thirteen"? Nonetheless, great work.
&gt; using the Google Places API Using the API isn't what OP is talking about.
Did you use the MNIST dataset for training?
If the original image isn't square you're either going to have to change the aspect ratio or crop the image. &amp;#x200B; So: 1. Determine wether the image is smaller than 600x600 or larger. 2. If larger: 1. Determine which direction is \*smaller\* of the two (L,W) 1. Shrink that to 600px. 2. Then determine where to crop. 3. If smaller: 1. Determine which direction is the smaller of the two (L,W) 1. Upscale that to 600px 2. Determine where to crop. &amp;#x200B; The determine where to crop is the hard part.
I'm just starting learning Python so I will give a try with your videos 👌ty
Of course for professionals this post is uninteresting, but remember it's a personal achievement that we once had as well. He just decided to make it public. For newcomers however, this post sparks interest in ML/CNNs, so that's a good thing.
&gt; crop the image Or letterbox it!
I think he meant /u/fengax but saw someone else comment and thought it was op, and then used /r/ instead of /u/
I gave you 4 very clear options and you couldn't just pick one?
How is that neither a crop nor a aspect ratio change? &amp;#x200B; He's got to get it to 600x600 (roughly) for a sticker, remember.
Not everyone in the sub have years of Python or ML experience.
yes i wanted to want to shrink the image so their larger dimension is 600px, then add a letterbox.
You keep the aspect ratio of the actual image the same, so it's not an aspect ratio change. You don't delete any of the actual image, so it's not a crop. I suppose you could argue that it's a negative crop, if you wanted to be pedantic. A 600x600 sticker which has 100px of whitespace at the top and bottom (i.e. the image in it takes up 600x400) may well be what they want.
"real time" has a specific meaning in some circles-- [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time\_computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing). Is this what you mean? &amp;#x200B; In that case the answer is "it depends on your constraints, and the underlying hardware and operating system". &amp;#x200B; However if you mean "is it possible to write a script that does this really quickly as I scan things", yeah, it's a really simple operation: &amp;#x200B; `#!/usr/bin/python3` `long_sn='abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz01234567890'` `print(long_sn[-10:])` &amp;#x200B; Gives: 1234567890 &amp;#x200B; The much harder problem is building all the scaffolding around doing that with your barcode scanner.
Name?
Ok. &amp;#x200B; I had sort of assumed that the OP had discarded that option.
I don't remember. Go to the edx site and search for "python". there's lots of classes there that might be interesting, and the MIT one will say "MIT".
Fantastic, that's much more clear. It looks like you're already getting very close. Where are you coming unstuck? Your scripts seem to be doing everything they need to: rescale the original image, then paste the result into an empty square image, choosing its top left corner based on its dimensions. You just need to pick which dimension to scale to 600 based on which dimension is bigger, rather than always picking the width as you've done in your first code block.
First of all it is important to have a clear goal and if you ultimate goal is to become a software developer that is great and totally possible if you are dedicated. &amp;#x200B; I would say set small and interesting goals and work on them by creating new programs. 1. Maybe you can automate some boring stuff that you have to do on a weekly basis at your job or at home. 2. Create a small game? 3. Do some physics simulation in pygame? 4. Follow a data science tutorial and work on some of the easier problems from kaggle. 5. Make up a fake company and create a small program that could help them. example: import and export company that has a warehouse and they need something to track their inventory. You could implement your own adt's. &amp;#x200B; Data visualization skills could come in handy even in your job now, however I feel it is pretty limited in terms of how big and complex a program can be and the analysis of data is more important. &amp;#x200B; One of the most important skills to have is to learn how to break big problems down into very small ones. That is why it is nice to work on some bigger projects so you learn how to design your program. You get to think about classes, inheritance etc. &amp;#x200B; edit: Since your hobby is photography how about using django or flask to create a website on which you can display your pictures.

ohh, Thanks will try it!
Since (it seems like) you've never done this before, let me offer some advice: &amp;#x200B; 1) Make it clear in the contract this this is "Work for Hire": [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work\_for\_hire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_for_hire) and follow your side of those rules. 2) Specify EXACTLY what you expect the code to do. "Scrape Google Maps For Restaurants" isn't a good requirement (and since the API is available that's really going to be a better option). Something like "Using the Google API, get the name, the street address (define format) including zipcode, the phone number, and the website (if any) and populate a sqlite3 database with this information" would be better. The more specific you can be, the less likelyhood there is for recriminations, and bad feelings. HOWEVER, accept that what you start off wanting may not be what you really want, so make arrangements for working with the developer to change this on the fly. 3) Along with #2, break the work up into a series of deliverable over time. Sort of like the notion of "agile" programming where you can track progress and adjust expectations and future deliverables based on what the developer runs into or finds.
Did he do it in python? If so you should get in touch with the guy and have him get in touch with the OP--he already knows the problem space.
y tho 🤔
Now also made a blog post about it: [https://evennia.blogspot.com/2019/07/evennia-09-released.html](https://evennia.blogspot.com/2019/07/evennia-09-released.html)
Thank you for your ideas. I will try to do something that could automate things that i do pretty much every day. Thats a nice idea , as far as it goes with flask and django. My first interaction with any sort of code was HTML back in 2000s and creating some simple web sites with notepad , then i got into dreamviewer , but jet again i am afraid that i am too dumb , plus i lost all that drive toward web dev that i had as a kid. It seems like i just have to pick up something and start working on it instead of wasting time being worried about my intellectual capability...
the best thing about python is its readability which makes the skill ceiling a lot lower to begin coding in then say languages such as c/c++. when i was learning coming from c++ the main way i learned was converting past projects i did in c++ to python. you'll learn fast that things are a lot simpler to achieve in python but just as powerful. so that would be my advice starting out, since u have some development experience already try re-creating those past projects in the context of python.
Yes, either Github or if you have a zoom video, Youtube is cool
Does it work for different ways of writing stuff like 2s 0s and 7s?
Excellent. New Video coming out today on List Comprehension s.
Launch the python contained in your venv and check to see if the modules in your venv load: ```&lt;path to venv&gt;/bin/python -i import xxx ```
decimals for a tendency to not be precise in python
despite the way i got answer, i got it and that matters. I m a teacher and have not studied math for like 20 years. I taught c++ for 19years and that too the basic stuff. Good to get home work though :) what is stack overflow I kind of remember it is related to memory management or something
Nice trick! So. I assume that means the interactive python I launch from my cli is pointing to the wrong place? And. YES! It’s because I added an alias in my bash profile to have python by python3. I’d have thought the venv bin would take precedent.
It does come in handy. You can launch (in at least) two different ways, directly: &lt;path to venv&gt;/bin/&lt;executable&gt; or by activating the venv: &lt;path to venv&gt;/bin/activate
just fyi, this doesn't work with the most recent python version (3.7.2). &amp;#x200B; some of the modules have been depreciated
We need more info about your current skillsets before we can give any advice that is relevant to you. I've tried going through your old Reddit posts to get a sense of where you are, but the info I'm is very inconsistent. In a post two months ago, you stated you had been working at your company for almost a year. In this post, you said you've only been there for 3 months? Which is it? Being at a job for a year and not being able to understand the code you're supposed to work on is very different from someone who has 3 months of experience and is still getting used to the codebase. To be improve yourself, you'll have to be honest with yourself and those who are trying to help you so we can give you proper advice.
If you don't get over that hump yourself then you will be feeling that way forever, have a look at automate the boring stuff with python you can get it for free online but that's just programming you figure stuff out how to put logic into code The same way you put thoughts to english you have a word a variable and now you make a function so a sentence into a paragraph so a class into an application so an essay. The better structured the better the essay right?
it was super confusing because `which python` showed the correct one but the alias from my profile was taking precedent when I'd launch it. I wish there was a way around that. It's all good for now.

1. Can you give us an example of when you have gotten stuck at work? What was the task you were trying to complete? 2. How familiar are you with reading the Django and Django Rest documentations? 3. What do you understand about REST API? 4. Outside of Django and Django Rest, how comfortable are you coding in Python. Again, these questions weren't meant to mock you, but we need to know where you stand. We're here to help you improve as a programmer, not to give you approval so ypu can feel good.
I'm also building a very similar app. Django + some custom modules I've made. Right now the repo is private, but would love to collaborate with others doing similar stuff, and share knowledge. As far as scraping data, I have a working, asynchronous data scraping module I made, that uses a combination or Tor + Privoxy to mask the local IP of the server running the scraper. In the case that a Tor IP is blocked, it has about 5 backup proxy services it uses. It also rotates IP's every 20 seconds. It randomizes the scrape order too, so pattern detection isn't possible. In the event that a browser is needed to run a script for data, it can open a headless browser with some JS manipulation to try preventing being detected as a "bot". I scrape a few different sites/apps to aggregate successful crowd picks, which gives me a subset of stocks to monitor. Once I have a filtered set of stocks to monitor, the application does fundamental, technical, sentiment, and trend analysis to rank the stocks I'm monitoring in terms of long-term buy-hold potential. It also uses some regression analysis to try and help with short-term timing of buy/sells. Once I have a portfolio of stocks, it does active re-balancing of the portfolio and also mitigates exposure and risk through other allocation algorithms. Etc... I keep adding more and more ideas to it, so would be good to see what others have done so we don't all re-invent the wheel.
I know keras, and I think the second option is more readable. However, the first option is much easier to interpret for people getting into deep learning.

[https://github.com/CrownsDE/PyMinMon](https://github.com/CrownsDE/PyMinMon) [Picture](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CrownsDE/PyMinMon/master/bin/MiniTool.png) Actually I'm working on Lidar odometry, mapping and localization for my Masterthesis but sometimes you need a small break.
&gt;Some day I hope to see code that takes no effort to understand. 'Some effort' compared to alternatives &gt;Less readable to who? To the reader
I'd specify that this is for natural languages and not tokenization in regards to programming languages or something like that
Oh, that's a really good point... let this be one of the top comments :-)
If one can get a func list at run time, one can also get their results as well. The code part that handles adding func to list could call the function get the result. May be what you have is a very specific case.
This reminds me of a project I made where it had a transparent window that could "read" the computer screen behind it. Then an AI could see your screen and interact with it.
I'll be there the whole week (have been there a couple of times now) and, if you're coming for the first time, I can recommend volunteering! It's fun and you will get to know a lot of people that way. [https://twitter.com/europython/status/1146460395995041793](https://twitter.com/europython/status/1146460395995041793) If you're in town earlier, you can volunteer for the training days and the Monday bag stuffing event is legendary. It makes sense to volunteer early in the week so you get to know people early on. &amp;#x200B; If this is not for you, you should still get the Telegram App for your phone and join the telegram group for Europython. This let's you find out, in which pubs and restaurants everybody is after the day - and will help you locate the board gamers as well (if that's your sort of thing). &amp;#x200B; There's a social event you can book for thursday - this has the disadvantage of being near the end of the conference, so it's a bit late to get to know new people by then. &amp;#x200B; For keynotes &amp; talks, pick a few in advance that you care about, but don't get stressed, if you can't make them because something more interesting has detracted you. Selecting what you would like to see in advance helps you, so that you do not need to search the schedule on the day. &amp;#x200B; Another thing that's useful: Assuming you have something you want to achieve with Python, think about what you want to learn and then be prepared to talk about that with anyone who wants to listen to you: You're at a place where over 1000 people like to talk about Python and are exited to help you, if you ask the right questions. This includes speakers. And at the same time, help others getting started with things you're good at in Python. &amp;#x200B; If you bring a laptop, make sure you have a current Python3.7, Jupyter lab and your favorite packages installed. If you're on Windows, you may want to install a virtual machine with Linux on your laptop (which also needs a current Python &amp; jupyter lab). I went to my first Europython with a Windows only laptop which was a mistake. &amp;#x200B; Finally, learn about the PacMan Rule ([https://conference.accu.org/pacman\_rule.html](https://conference.accu.org/pacman_rule.html)) and don't be shy to talk to people standing next to you.
this gets top of r python? This is literally the hello world of neural networks, what the hell you guys lmao, this will be easy karma to cash in on
Precisely, I'm about to start an MS (eventually PhD), and am heavily interested in bringing ML into my field (it's only in it's infancy as it is). Every time I see any posy regarding ML, I save it for future reference because of all the feedback that they usually have. Feedback that I will use once I've learned enough Python to get into ML.
Because reddit karma is so much more important than giving someone praise and motivation for their achievement (it may seem trivial to you, but at some point this was a challenge to everybody).
You can use `textwrap.dedent` so that you don't have strings like your `find_next_prime` verbose message messing with indentation levels.
Wow, amazing info! Thank you so much for the advises! Yes, it is my first time on such event. Unfortunately, I got to go through the company I work currently for and will not be able to take part of the first two days. However, I hear what you say and will definitely take part in the one next year. All the topics and talks available on the site have been scanned and picked what I find interesting and what might bring some company value. Thank you for reminding me to check out the rusty(on my phone) Telegram app! Will try to make most of it, again, thanks for the advises!
We get it, you leant “neural networks” by following one of 1000 easy to follow tutorials. Can we now discuss something interesting
why lump these together? And I would probably consider contributing to existing libraries instead
Missed 420 opportunity
https://github.com/alexmojaki/snoop
https://github.com/alexmojaki/snoop https://github.com/alexmojaki/birdseye
I think there's a pretty large need, especially in environmental social science fields, to be able to link qualitative data to specific locations. Of course there are existing ways to do this by munging together data types from a bunch of different existing libraries, but there isn't a single useful library for working intentionally with textual location data. I'd definitely like to contribute to existing libraries as well.
And you recorded it with your phone?
No-one ever completely learns anything. Instead people discover that there's a lot more stuff they don't know, and so the percentage-believed-known _drops_ when experience increases. I know more than I did yesterday, but less than I _thought_ I knew yesterday by a greater margin. That said, around 2 years of daily use before _dreaming in python_ instead of java or php or perl. _Doing_ is a solid route toward experience. And reading the [whole manual cover-to-cover](https://docs.python.org/) is helpful. So is reading someone else's code (eg the standard library) and writing comments/docstrings.
Will you please comment your code to describe the thought process / structure of the system? That is quite honestly the best way for someone to learn completely foreign libraries. In fact, I think that should be required for code that is less than 200 lines. You don't have to comment everything, even a few general concepts would help give a core to start unwrapping these lines from. It would be a huge benefit to both the students and the critics in this forum.

I don't think they meant to hamper the archivement but it really is the one project pretty much everybody does during their first machine learning course. The dataset is readily available and the problem and the resulting network is simple enough that it can be comfortably trained on a CPU. That makes it an excellent beginners project.
There's no such thing. What does happen is that you become knowledgeable enough to know how to find the answer.
I dont really care about karma TBH, just wanted to share.
Most of my work doesn't allow me to take advantage of the abstraction of keras, so I'm not fluent in it, but the following https://github.com/Fengax/Handwritten-Number-Classifier/blob/master/Keras_CNN_HandNumbers.py#L83 looks like this should be outside your graph construction loops? You are basically repetitively training on smaller versions of your network and throwing the results away?
This is good advice, but I just wanted to point out that some (a lot?) of the standard library is not great code to learn from.
https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/c6rzfp/python_now_beating_java_on_google_trends_worldwide/escq1vb/?context=3
20 years and I am still not done.
Try `sys.stdin.readline()`.
True though. A lot of it remains gross for backwards compatibility reasons. But hey; identifying which is which is a great exercise for the reader.
Usually you put in an image and get back a float value for each class, classes being the digits 0-9. The float values are called confidence and basically represent how sure the network is that an input belongs to that class. For example for a nicely drawn 3 you would expect a high output (close to 1) for the class 3 and very low outputs (close to 0) for the other classes. If the input doesn't resemble any digits and the network is trained that way you still have some classes getting higher results and other but with a much lower confidence (higher than the rest but not very close to 1). It's now up to you what you do with those confidence values. Sometimes it's important to always have results, sometimes it's more important to only work with results of which you are very sure. This video shows quite nicely how those classification systems can be tricked. https://youtu.be/mSFHKAvTGNk

Yep. `alias python=/usr/bin/python3` in OS X. I get it now. A lot of Mac users set that alias though because apple doesn’t ship with python3
You're _so close_! Just give it another 20 years.
Perfectly balanced, as all things should be.
Nice! Printing each password on a new line would probably make copying them easier. New problem for you is retrieving each value from the array.
Just to elaborate - Python 2 has reached end of the line, and will stop being maintained soon. While Python 2 and 3 are very similar, they differ in some certain quirks. It would be wise to move to Python 3 now that you are learning! Most notable difference you'll find: print "string" # py 2 print("string") # py 3
R/unexpectedthanos
That project has sort of an unusual setup, so I understand your confusion. To me, it looks like they want you to run `python main.py`.

Yeah...
Sure! I will update it.
Hmm. I just tried with my typical handwriting and it worked 9/10. I'm not too sure how else you can write 2 0 or 7.
Yes. However I imported the whole thing as jpg so the machine can learn better. I tried it directly importing mnist from tensorflow but when I actually tested it, it couldn't predict anything.

I have not trained it on double digits yet. I'd imagine you have to use some sort of object detection

About 5-6 hours in total. However keep in mind my computer is running on CPU not GPU so most of the time it is just training the model. Took like 2 hours alone just analysing and optimising the model.
Ha! Follow one fail with another. That's how I do it.
About 5-6 hours. However if u have a GPU computer can probably cut this time into 2-3 hours.

do i just cd the directory then do "main.py"?
so try it with python 3.6
_[Explanation below is for Unix operating system. Windows works a tiny bit different, but it has no impact on the code and you can imagine things happening the same way there]_ When you start a program, operating system connects it to the console with three descriptors: _stdin_ (standard input), _stdout_ (standard output) and _stderr_ (standard error output). Standard input yields a stream of characters typed in the console or coming from the pipe. Standard output is where everything you print goes. Standard error output is where you should write error messages to, so they don't interfere with standard output when you redirect it (you don't want error messages and diagnostic information in the output file or fed to a program through a pipe). Module `sys` provides these three descriptors as File objects: `sys.stdin`, `sys.stdout` and `sys.stderr`. You can read from the first one and write to the others. In your case, you want to read from standard input and that's what `sys.stdin.read()` and `sys.stdin.readline()` methods do. See documentation for more information. Example (in IPython): In [1]: import sys In [2]: what_i_typed = sys.stdin.readline() I am typing this in the console :) In [3]: print("My input was: " + what_i_typed) My input was: I am typing this in the console :)
2 has a small loop to it's bottom portion 0 would have a line through it diagonally 7 would have a straight horizontal line through it
Python 3 has the secrets module too
`diff file1.csv file2.csv &gt; differences.txt` Oh, right, you wanted Python. Okay - `import os; os.system('diff file1.csv file2.csv &gt; differences.txt')`
On GNU/Linux: `cat /dev/urandom | tr -dc [:graph:] | fold -n 8 | head -n 3`
Cool man, good stuff. Did you do much tweaking with the precision/recall threshold?
I haven't tried it, but I'm doubtful that it would remain as accurate, mainly because the dataset I'm training from (MNIST dataset) doesn't have digits written like the way you did. But in theory, yes you can, if you have the dataset of digits written like that. If I have the time, I might even construct some additional images to the MNIST dataset.
 I edited the code to run it on my machine. Like said, it’s an FYI - if you decide to update it it’s up to you :)
Hmm, I don't know how you started neural networks, but I didn't jump straight to geometric deep learning.

Thanks! Never knew I could do that.
make one thats random AND easy to remember
Essentially, the network converts the image's pixels to a number, so each image is represented as a numpy array. In this case, I have normalized the number, so the numbers are between 0 and 1. Then the network uses convolutions to train using these "arrays" used to represent each image. Convolutions basically mimic how mammals see images, using "kernels" to scan through a designated are and then jumps to a new area (with a designated stride size). The details are quite complicated. There are several great tutorials online that explains the process. After the network is trained. The testing images (the images that I draw) again gets converted into numpy arrays and the network predicts it.
Sorry I just realized I replied to the wrong person! Ignore the last comment. Anyways, yes I guess it predicts the most look-alike number, as I haven't trained it on handwritten letters yet.
You don't completely learn Python, this is simply impossible with math or any type of programming language. But if you mean *comfortable*, about 2 or 3 years maybe?
Yea thank you dude ! i just Download Python3.7 in my linux machine and i didn't find PyQt5 module When i try to pip install it . i can't find the module ! i guess that the problem
Web scraping can often be illegal - make sure the potential employee knows legal aspects of the job as well.
I set my `PATH` to include a python3 `bin/` directory. Then it also includes any script entry points for things I `pip install` there.
I think you need to run 'python file.py'
i don't even see that one
Sure but there's probably nothing that you can't code in python. You could be tasked with creating any kind of app and you'd be able to do it I assume, at least with some Googling.
Good luck to you! I really miss working with LPMuds. Do you have anything you feel confident enough about to show off yet?

Ask in /r/learnpython
There's plenty I can't code in python. Python is nothing. It's the environment surrounding it that makes you proficient. Heck, even in the standard library there's stuff that it's there since years, and I discovered something new (for me) all the time. It's like vim. You never learn vim. There's always something you don't know. Also, there are a few things that I know but I never use in practice. If you ask me to implement something with metaclasses, yeah, I can do it. I understand what's going on, but it's not something I do every day, so I'll fuck up here and there.
Completely learning something is a myth. Just start learning and keep learning. I have been studying and using Python since 2009, yet just the other day a colleague reviewed some piece of code i wrote for a project we are both working on and made improvements that i had not even noticed. Two things happened: i learned something new and unlearned something old. You may learn the syntax and have it down completely but you'll never learn python completely.
I have been at it part time, on and off for over 5 years and I still don't now jack (relatively speaking)
&gt; 'Some effort' compared to alternatives That's a good thing, right? Some effort is better than lots of effort. &gt; &gt; Less readable to who? &gt; &gt; To the reader Well obviously the reader, but *which* reader? How experienced are they? What is their programming background? Do they have a maths background or experience in functional programming languages like Haskell? Are they comfortable with functions as first class values, or perhaps their only programming experience has been in 1970s BASIC? The point (which you seem to have completely missed) is that generalising what is "readable" is not justified. Reading code is like reading text (hardly surprising since code is text) and just as there people differ in their reading skills (starting with "See Spot run." and going up from there), people differ in what code is readable to them. I think what you mean is that reading functional programming style code is *harder for you*, rather than objectively harder for everyone. In which case you should say so and not overgeneralise.
[confused exasperation in the distance]
To get to comfortable level being able to write my programs without constantly Googling, 6 attempts and roughly year and half.

They are running it from IDLE or command line. When you are running via the IDE it runs as a script versus immediately
You have a link to the source code? Is it on Github? What random number generator are you using?
A neural network is somewhat of an AI, is that right?
So if I am running through Sublime what should I do? I am new to all this and don't know what to do.
Find an open source program on Github that you find worthy of spending your time on. Mozilla has a number of projects that are supported by mentors [https://codetribute.mozilla.org/](https://codetribute.mozilla.org/)
File.py represents the file you want to run in the project...I am on my phone. I can't look right now. There should be a readme file that tells you what file launches it.
You are already doing it. Just use print(variable). If you want an interactive command line inside of sublime, follow this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIl0mmYSPIc to setup and interactive mode

Should I pay to read article ? #not
I started using python maybe 5-6 years ago. I started getting paid to use python 1.5 years ago. I work with a lot of brilliant developers and a few python core contributors. I still wouldn't say I am anywhere near to having completely learned the language, that's not really an obtainable level. Every day I'm learning more and more about the language by using it, asking questions, breaking things and then picking up the pieces. &amp;#x200B; If you are interested in learning "about the python language" rather than just learning to write a bit of python (edit: I don't mean to suggest you shouldn't do both!) then check out [https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html) and the book [http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920032519.do](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920032519.do) &amp;#x200B; These are resources that will help you greatly learn about the language at a very low (fundamental) level. They aren't meant as an Intro to Python or Python 101 type resource. I think the description of Fluent python says it better than I can: \&gt; Python’s simplicity lets you become productive quickly, but this often means you aren’t using everything it has to offer. With this hands-on guide, you’ll learn how to write effective, idiomatic Python code by leveraging its best—and possibly most neglected—features
It's not bad I just like splash over selenium and tend to use scrapy more that beautifulsoup
Yeah, most people call it AI. However, I feel like AI is too general of a term to be used here.
It's definitely some kind of Machine Learning. I haven't done anything related to Machine Learning, so I can't give much input. I do have an idea on what neural networks are however.
I took zero coding or programming classes in high school, college or beyond. Everything I know is from teaching myself, trial and error, YouTube videos and thousands of Stack Overflow searches. Just today, I had to search old code just to find something I did years ago because I couldn’t remember how to do it. I’d love to know what life would be like with more formal coding or programming training but alas, it’ll never be.
&gt;Using MNIST to classify handwritten digits is so unbelievably easy If you understand what Neural Networks are, have read about how to use them for that task, understand calculus, can implement gradient descent, back prop.. yeah, pretty much ez. I don't understand the hype around it /s
You can do a swirly two, a seven with a bar through it and a zero with a line diagonally across the middle
Oh damn, I forgot it got put behind a paywall. Sorry m8
Your network has got softmax activation on the output layer, that means it gives you "probabilities" of what it thinks inputs are. My bet is your weird 2 still gets the highest score despite of looking "weird", but probably lower score than a "normal" 2.
I just had to rewrite a bunch of code because I learned a better way to do something. And I mean a bunch! I'm not a beginner either.
You both should look into using anaconda, it manages environments and packages really well. Basically it installs python3 and you run vs code or juypter notebook thru that, as a semi noob i definitely recommend. [Anaconda Download Link](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/)
Passwords should be printed as all stars..... I'm just kidding :p
About 3 years or so I'd say. Also depends on what kind of projects you're working on and how much you're coding. I started with almost no experience and began with building small scripts to assist me with daily work related tasks. Finally just finished a large data validation/web proxy tool with a Pyside2 UI for my coworkers and I feel fairly confident in my coding capabilities now. Wouldn't say I completely know Python but I understand a large portion of it which allows me to tackle a lot of different problems.
True.

To improve readability you should work on your coding style. In just a few minutes, I've seen some things like : mixing code and functions, not using __main__, bad import sorting, not using docstrings, etc... You should start by using PEP8 and pylint on your project. Good work though
Try https://github.com/encode/requests-async

That's my guess. `cd /path/to/omeglebot` `python main.py`
Why would they make that change? I don't use python like ever but one thing I always liked about the language that made it fun was it's essentially like writing in psuedo code. This feels like a small departure away from that
Out of curiosity, after you posted, did you look at your post to see how it looks to the reader? Because to me, it's really hard to read. You have a single enormously wide line which starts "1. Your program must accept...", it is nearly three times as wide as my monitor. The "following three input commands" aren't given. To answer your questions: &gt; Is my implementation of condition # 2 correct? Dunno, I don't know what commands you are supposed to accept. But as given, your program requires **all three** commands, and it doesn't seem to care what the user gives: myprogram foo spaghetti lunchtime will be accepted. That's probably wrong. I expect they're probably intended to be optional. &gt; How do I implement condition # 1? Ignoring the part about the three commands, you probably should do something like this: * Check if a file name is given; if so, you read from that file. * If no file name is given, read from stdin instead. Doing no error recovery at all, something like this might work: # Untested! import sys if len(sys.argv) == 2: filename = sys.argv[1] with open(filename, 'r') as f: text = f.read() else: text = sys.stdin.read() Note that I've made no attempt to recover from errors (what if the file name doesn't exist? what if you don't have read permission?), nor have I tried to read from standard input in blocks. But this is probably a good start.
Funnily enough I can't upload to GitHub until I'm home again today, but will do :)
Print is just another function, it should be treated that way

Call me old school but I still like pen and paper but obviously not for day to day use lol Mainly for planning or design or teaching someone
It's known that writing things on paper (instead of computer) improves learning. Helps with recollection. So that's one.
I do this constantly. I guess a program is never really ready, hah!

Easier readability imo if you know it is a function. Space also can be confusing when reading a lot of code as a student.
Python just keeps getting better and better. Props to all contributers!
Back in the day, if windows had problems or was loading you could move the window and get a [bug](https://media1.giphy.com/media/mq5y2jHRCAqMo/giphy.gif?cid=790b76115d1ee9bc562e366259a03b44&amp;rid=giphy.gif) in the graphical rendering of the window. His "line" drawing made me remeber this. Since I have never seen this I was courious if it was an intentional line drawing style or if something is not working properly.

Try writing it in c++ instead of python. It's rather easy in python. I'm more the fan of writing everything myself.
In Python 2 print was a keyword. In Python 3 it's a function. It's more consistent.
&gt; Don’t wait just get Advanced Course certification from the Industry certified professionals today. This sums up the article pretty well. 0/10 would not read again.
So it's not a IDE toolset exam, sometimes you just have basic stuff and you need to be able to do something. (In France we say "seul avec ta bite et ton couteau") With IDE knowing where getter and setter, create function... Also students tend to want the program working so could be blocked for a little error forgiven by teacher. Also it force you to make a code readable and avoid the "it just works". Also often it's because there will be a mix between code and class questions. There a lot of good reasons. In my university if there code asked we would have "unlimited" time at home to do it. I think it's because they only care about academic achievements and practice can be learn on our own.
Literally its only purpose was to allow you to go, "Wow, Python is so easy! Printing hello world is literally `print "Hello world"`!", but it was so inconvenient otherwise that it wasn't even worth that upside. If you ever find yourself asking, "Huh, why did Python do that?", remember that **every** major change in Python is accompanied by a PEP, or Python Enhancement Proposal. This one's no exception, and the Rationale section of [PEP 3105 -- Make print a function](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3105/) should clear everything up.
 import os, sys, argparse, base64 parser = argparse.ArgumentParser() parser.add_argument("length", type=int, nargs="?", default=8) parser.add_argument("count", type=int, nargs="?", default=3) args = parser.parse_args() print("\n".join( base64.b64encode(os.urandom(args.length)).decode("utf-8")[:args.length] for _ in range(args.count) ))
Much better
I'm still waiting for Flask to work with py3.8 ..
Sooo... A Swedish lexicon?
&gt; Why would they make that change? Jumping on this bandwagon, `print()` supports features that `print_stmt` doesn't (without unintuitive hacks); This is with the print function; import sys, os print('Hello', 'World', file=sys.stderr, sep=os.linesep, end='') And this is the same with `print_stmt` import sys, os print &gt;&gt;sys.stderr, os.linesep.join(('Hello', 'World')), (Also note that the only alternative end character to "newline" in `print_stmt` is "nothing", where Python3 lets you use any string. Oh, and `print_stmt` doesn't have a forcible flush option, either).
It used to be Swedish words now they're easy to remember gibberish.

I would use your interest to make commits to geopy. No need for a whole new library.
Assignment expressions make me uneasy
One of the key features of Babel (and other gettext derivations) is message extraction. In this way, you write UI code like this (suppose the templating engine is Jinja2): &lt;td&gt;{% trans -%} Customer Name {%- endtrans %}&lt;/td&gt; And then the message extractor makes a catalog template (*.pot*) file like this: msgid "Customer Name.\n" msgstr "" If you want to add a new language to support for your software, copy this catalog template, name it like *LC_MESSAGES/zh/messages.po*, and fill the appropriate contents into the file. Every time you add a new UI message to your software, you will run the message extractor, and then merge the new catalog template with the existing translated catalogs. And then translators fill these added empty messages. (Already translated messages won't go anywhere but just be left there.) This way is easier to divide the works between front-end engineers and professional translators, because: - it prevents to miss out messages that should be translated, - engineers are easier to have a good grasp of concrete meaning of messages to be translated, because messages in code are written as a complete sentence in a natural language (it's usually English in F/OSS projects), and - there are a lot of softwares to work on *.pot*/*.po* message catalogs, from simple GUI editors to Web-based real-time collaborative editors. Besides above, there are much more good features like: - You can distinguish singular and plural nouns. And it doesn't bother in East Asian languages, which don't have grammatical singular–plural distinction. - HTML templating engines tend to have a special syntax for gettext/Babel. - Babel's message extractor leave comments that give some context of messages, by showing the code where a message appears.
Stack overflow is when you push too much data into stack (more than it can hold). So it "overflows" and corrupts nearby data. Modern IDEs don't allow for it and just throw an exception Second meaning the one i meant): Stackoverflow is a webite for programmers that contains thousands of answerd programming questions (you can ask and answer questions there too but be prepared: people there are quite full of themselves, and for a good reason: they are often great programmers).
My advice: set up a linting rule to ban their use.
1. Post an example of your code. 2. Don't use images because we can't cut-and-paste, so we need to type it all our. 3. Rather post beginner questions to /r/learnpython

20 minutes to write the applications name and a bitcoin address into a Readme sounds quite long.
They are actually what I'm most excited about in this release. I like writing one-liners if they are simple enough. Cases like this happen frequently on my code: &gt;match = re.match(data) &gt; &gt;group = match.group(1) if match else None And I think they look better with the new feature: &gt; group = match.group(1) if (match := re.match(data)) else None But I do agree that it is an easily-misused feature that people will likely abuse...
there isn't and there is a dozen .py files in there
One thing I haven't been liking in latest python releases is that they are favoring symbols over words. This is pretty evident in this release, both in assignment expressions and positional only arguments. I really like that python tries to present itself more like English text than math expressions, so seeing the language losing this trait is a bit sad.

I got your confusion. Basically I have experience (after graduating) for almost a year. I did a R&amp;D based remote job where I had to work with Machine Learning ( Kaggle and others). Later I got into this job as a developer. I got this job with my problem solving skills in different OJ, knowledge of data structures and algorithms. 1. Yeah sure. The user books a trip by assigning to and from destination, date and time. The price is calculated. I have to send this price and it's breakdown to the backend admin system. 2. I tried to start, but my senior colleagues said to get the basics and jump into work. I will learn in the fly. I got the basic architecture idea from a crash course. 3. It does crud operations. 4. I solved problems in python and wrote scrapers in my pervious job. I am very comfortable writing code in python.

I've seen the code. And nope, they haven't used CUDA. As far as I know, CASA which is the principal framework that astronomers use to deconvolve or reconstruct their images does not support GPU or CUDA yet. Nevertheless, there are research groups (as one where I belong to) working with CUDA. We have also created a similar framework as the one used in the black hole image paper in C++ and CUDA. [https://github.com/miguelcarcamov/gpuvmem](https://github.com/miguelcarcamov/gpuvmem) :)
That's awful...
Yeah, that looks weird. The formatting isn't helping though. Do me a favor. Copy your code into pastebin.com, set syntax highlighting for Python, and click Create New Paste. Then post that link. I just want to eliminate any issues caused by Reddit formatting.
You know what, nvm, I caught it. You misspelled strength, and you switched a = sign for a + at the bottom.
Deal.
Cool. I will hit you up once the app goes public.
 def get(pkg_name , cfgpath=None): if cfgpath == None: cfgpath = os.path.expanduser("~/.config/%s" % pkg_name) if not os.path.isdir(cfgpath): os.makedirs(cfgpath) return None cfgpath = os.path.join(cfgpath, "cfg.json") if not os.path.isfile(cfgpath): &gt; def save(pkg_name, cfgobject, cfgpath=None): if cfgpath == None: cfgpath = os.path.expanduser("~/.config/%s" % pkg_name) if not os.path.isdir(cfgpath): os.makedirs(cfgpath) cfgpath = os.path.join(cfgpath, "cfg.json") In 10 lines of code, 5 are duplicated. How about you follow your own advice then?
That sounds interesting. The "cloak" part is completely missing in my app as long as I havent had any issues with banning or restricting my server IP address. On the other hand it would be nice to have such functionality in case I will have to face that. Also the analysis part you write about sounds interesting. Is your repo public?

I read passwords like these are secure against humans but easy for computers to crack, whereas 4 random words are a lot harder to crack. We trained ourselves to think complicated passwords == secure. https://xkcd.com/936/ https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/936:_Password_Strength
Take a look at pwgen for a bit more inspiration and stop using python 2
Why?
Great, good effort keep going on.
I would say kaggle.com
 I really prefer the 2 lined version here. But maybe there is a case for while loop initialisation. := takes a lot away from the readability :(
Yes, I will do this. But it won’t stop others and I have to read others’ code...

You are talking non-sense. Invoking functions directly is far easier to read than putting them in a list and then applying them over a loop. People write code for results. Not for activity and hype. If you work in any serious project with above half a million lines of code and a dozen developers, you will know why simplicity is utmost important.
Thats what i did when i tried to make a clothing brand.. "Svoon", "Wadi", it didnt work out.
I've moved to [starlette](https://www.starlette.io/). It's async, not that it was the reason for me to move to it, but it's a leaner and cleaner project these days.
To be sincere I don't know what you want to look for, there isn't much to evaluate but **simple syntax**. One thing I believe will stand out will be the students which will use **regex** to parse the passwords and those that won't really know how to see if there are upper or lower-case characters. Maybe some of them will use better programming patterns than **nested if-else** statements, like a dictionary for the flow of options.
Passwords are globally the weakest link when it comes to security. They are often guessed and reused. Random passwords will help the guessing part, but passwords that you can remember encourage reuse. The issue with reuse is that even a good password can fall into the hands of an attacker via phishing or stealing a website's database that isn't well protected (which is to say: most of them). To limit that risk it is important to have non-guessable, long, unique passwords on all accounts. Most people can't remember more than a few random passwords so they'll just reuse them. The solution exists: use a password manager. It'll generate strong passwords that you don't need to remember and completely avoid that entire issue. Password manager are the way to go and the only good solution if you fear not to remember your passwords or are concerned with your online security (which is what passwords are all about). (Well, I'm lying a bit there, not using passwords at all is another good solution to that problem, but not every service allows it).
Thank you, I am checking it out :)
Thanks for the links
Thank you :) Content looks nice..

No, it's not. Being used in import statements, it would create a lot of confusion
It was discussed but they were worried it would confuse the use of `as` in the `with` statement, which is different. I'm not sure I agree. As for positional args, `/` is definitely the right choice because it's already used that way in the docs and acts oppositely to how a solitary `*` is used.
What’s a supply teacher? That like subbing?
It's more direct then usual anyway.
They are expecting code to be delivered to you I believe, along with other things outside of your picture.
It's British English and means the same as substitute teacher.
I don't think a "lot of confusion", in one instance you have an import. but I'm not one of the devs. I think the other comment is on point, it's getting less verbal and more symbolic.
Yep they are [thread locals](https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug/blob/master/src/werkzeug/local.py) or green-thread locals under the hood. The latter (green-thread) matters if you wish to have concurrency using Gevent/Eventlet or similar. The concurrency choice is typically made by the WSGI server, see the [Gunicorn workers](http://docs.gunicorn.org/en/stable/design.html#choosing-a-worker-type) for an example. It shouldn't affect you; it has only affected me when I've wanted my own context related variables, typically a `current_user`. In this case I want the variable to be local to the request, which translates to local to the thread or green-thread. It is quite interesting to learn how these work, (basically [this](https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug/blob/master/src/werkzeug/local.py#L18) bit). It is useful to know about how they affect writing tests, as you have to use the Flask machinery to setup the context in order for tests that use them to work.
Probably DataCamp.com
You have to start thinking about it in a different manner. If it's a single operation in your head, it should be a single operation in your code. Which is why list comprehension and other functional paradigms like `map`, `filter` are good. **I want to create a list of squares from 1 to 100** Bad: nums = [] for i in range(1, 101): nums.append(i * i) Good: nums = [i * i for i in range(1, 101)] # note: you could as well make a lazy generator expression too **I want to remove all positive numbers from a list of numbers** Bad: new_nums = [] for n in nums: if n &gt; 0: new_nums.append(n) Good: new_nums = list(filter(lambda n: n &gt; 0, nums)) **I want to get `f(.)` of all numbers, unless the `f(.)` is less than 50** Bad: items = [f(n) for n in nums] items = [n for n in nums if n &gt;= 50] Good: items = [item for n in nums if item:= f(n) &gt;= 50]
I was expecting that you could save the cfg files in all sorts of different formats for other programs to read in. Just saving to json is basically a python default.
After watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6sGWTCMz2k) by 3blue1brown i decided to write a small script to replicate hand drawn shapes ([gitlab repo](https://gitlab.com/giacomogallina/fourier))
Replacing "completely" with competently or comfortable with the language, I'd say 2-3 months for basic syntax and navigation, then about 6 months for a specific type of project. Python isn't hard. It's all the other things around it, like integration with company source control, working in virtual environments (servers and python), figuring out project requirements first, then learning the python to get the job done. As a language, it's quick to pick up and even become job ready with. The trick is understanding the job first, and applying the language to the job. That's where a lot of people struggle in the beginning.
You're also using a one liner if/else here. I'd rather write it as : match = re.match(data) if match is not None: # do stuff becoming : if (match := re.match(data)) is not None: # do stuff Here you do save one line, and I think the newer version is indeed more readable.
Awesome, I been thinking about these, seeing them lately and wanted to learn more, very cool.
Regex is a possible approach, but an easy way to confirm would be to check whether `string.lower()` is the same as the original string, and then do the same for `string.upper()`. If neither are the same, then the string must contain both upper and lowercase letters.
Pretty cool stuff, i'm not gonna lie. Are there practical application for such replication? Because even though that looks pretty cool, i really don't know how this can be used. So hopefully someone will tell me. Something that looks so cool has got to have a practical application.
Yeah, Fourier Transforms are incredibly useful! They can decompose pretty much any random function into a sum of sine waves. For example, they let you distinguish the different frequencies that compose a sound.
Snek
I could be misunderstanding you but I think it's enough for you to run the code and evaluate it manually that it lives up the requirements listed on that paper. In other words, if you don't know Python you can't be expected to evaluate their coding. Instead evaluate the results of their code. In this case the Login form and the resulting menu.
Two snakes. I can see your point though, it is not obvious because they are styled so heavily.
I'm familiar with comprehensions, and also somewhat with the discussions/pep on walrus operator, my issue was the example assigning 2 variables in the same line and inside a ternary. This makes code unreadable and hard to see where match comes from. Sometimes compacting is good, but both walrus and comprehensions can be taken too far, and walrus inside a ternary is IMO a case of this. It's a balancing act of how much to compact code to keep it succinct while keeping it able to be quickly understood. I *could* write all my code in. 10% of the lines using a bunch of clever oneloners compacting algorithms as much as possible, but this would hurt readability. In regards to walrus, I'm fine with e.g. if x := ... Instead of x = ... if x: Which I believe is more in line with the intention, but I'm apprehensive of overuse of walrus (such as the example given) and of people making things *too* compact. Also AFAIK python tends to recommend always using comprehensions over filter/map for readability.
I think Mr. Toms should reconsider his password. Terrible lesson being taught here!

&gt; I have to send this price and it's breakdown to the backend admin system. Do you mean save it to the database or is it something else?
As soon as I committed the answer I thought someone would know a better way than regex, I just didn't remember how exactly was it. Thanks, I had forgotten about string lower and upper!
I only knew that they were used to draw curves. Particularly used in video games and software like photoshop and such. I didn't know that you could use it to approximate functions Cool stuff. Thanks for sharing.
I would never ever install such a dependency, wtf xD

Rather than a drawing, can we use an image and replicate it?
I edited it, my bad. I just thought it was funny that this guy can create a password generator with python but can't screenshot and send it to Dropbox or something
thank you
👶
the code examples have really funky indenting which obviously is a problem in python
That's not the best explanation of a problem i've ever seen. "Please god help me it doesn't work"... What doesn' work? What's wrong? What's the error? You've gotta put a minimum of effort in explaining your problem to people. Anyway, with that position, your player is presumably out of the bounds of your screen, seeing how the Y axis is negative. That negative value might be causing a problem in some math that you are using on the player position, and that are expecting a positive value.
Looks interesting, thanks a lot.
The issue is that i want to change to a different level (which is stored in a list) when i get to those coordinates. Now it does work if you ignore the fact that the level you change to is absolutely corrupted. That, is my issue

Nice work! &amp;#x200B; 3Blue1Brown is incredible. I could only wish to be able to speak about Math the way he does, and then to be able to illustrate it!? C'mon...
No problemo! :)

&gt; We abuse decorators to do basically the same thing, you mean, as in [traitlets](https://github.com/ipython/traitlets)?
"forgot" or just expect people can identify sarcasm.
The walrus operator now exists because people weren’t defining x and using the if like you should do. They were doing inefficient one liners.
i3-wm by any chance? Looks like a nice workflow, you should post on r/unixporn or r/workflow (I think that's the one?).
Hope you don’t use libraries. After list comprehensions came out, we banned those for a while.

Sway, a i3-wm clone for wayland!
You are a genius! I'm pissed I didn't think of this first!
I only copied what 3blue1brown did, you should see his video if you haven't already, the underlying math is really elegant and well explained!
WHOA
Honestly I think you should do the assignment yourself before grading the papers. That will give you some familiarity with Python and the challenges the students will face. You can't expect all the students' code to compile and run successfully. You should know enough to tell if they're just missing a few crucial pieces or if their entire solution is way off the mark.
Yeah, I've seen it, I was actually thinking about making one of these, but using mouse tracking that automatically generates it is really a stroke of genius, he didn't even think of that
I actually did it this way just because it way easier to write!
You're going to pay me €22 a month?

the JPEG compression algorithm works with a similar algorithm. Basically the image is represented by frequencies and then the higher frequencies are cut off
I’m gathering money from sources like nazi crap from my Jewish girlfriend, tracking down stolen art and cars &amp; bringing the goods and values back to the owner, getting little provisions bending global laws and rules for good, to act where others don’t...- then: collecting the money in the fund, currently hedging the fund manually to leverage our finances (the company's hard-cap) to finance various projects and presenting the projects to certain governmental committees to get subsidies for our projects like green and renewable energy, decarb, electrolytic hydrogen, providing water purification and desalination plants in regions where it’s necessary, bringing education to regions where it’s been said to be "impossible", having a 0% Carbon footprint is a goal of mine. But I urgently need a team to work with on these things. I’m disabled (got my spine broken in several places) and won’t be able to stem all of these things in time ever...
Oh, OK, the teflon thrusters. Will your master thesis lead to a paper ? Isn't there quite some activity on the subject going on at the moment ?

It's possible that it will, though not sure. To be honest, I don't know if the findings are worth a paper, and I'm not really interested in publishing anyways. It was an interesting learning experience, but I don't think it really was a big contribution to the actual knowledge about pulsed plasma thrusters in general.
I agree, this does seem possible.

&gt;I want to remove all positive numbers from a list of numbers Why not new_nums = [n for n in nums if n &gt; 0] It seems to me a lot more uncluttered and readable
You're going to pay me €22 a month? Would that be PayPal? Bitcoin? I don’t use crypto currencies. We’re using PayPal if necessary, but usually wire transfer via this nice credit card, issued by TransferWise https://transferwise.com/u/svenk170 - if you insist on payment in crypto, isn’t etherc a better option? Btw, developing some future blockchain technology for certain purposes is a state-of-the-business for issuing crypto compatible Visa or MasterCard credit cards. I’m having a lot of stuff worked out which are waiting to become realized now.
Holy shit! That's freaking cool man &lt;3
Wooow! Great project Bru!
WTF. It's bad enough that students come here for homework help. Now the teacher needs it too?
Than what? How would you do that with the walrus operator? You don’t have a single thing in there that requires anything complex.
Hey this is cool. Not really related but I am looking for a colour palette library that allows me to specify start and end colours and number of values and it gives me the palette in hex or specified format. I wrote s simple linear way of doing this but the colours look bad. I can find artist made palettes online. Do you know of any palette generators i could use or ideas to build one which isn't linear?
If "free" isn't an absolute requirement, then I'd like to put in a strong recommendation for Coursera. $50/month with no limit on number of courses, free one-week trial, discounts and subsidies available. Coursera has something 12 different specializations involving data science and machine learning, where each specialization is about four classes. Each specialization has a different target audience in terms of background knowledge and area of interest. The sequence that I just completed was taught by Andrew Ng, a Stanford CS adjunct and former head of Baidu's machine learning group. I had a background in machine learning from grad school several years ago, but wanted to update my skill set - since the field has been moving *really damn fast* for the last six years. The classes were perfect for me. They didn't gloss over the underlying math but also didn't get mired in it. They struck a good balance between depth (covering CNNs in detail) and breadth (also covering RNNs and GANs and some variations). They had some nice applied exercises, which were pretty cookbook but also informative. I really enjoyed the sequence and I am planning to continue with several others.

Hi there, from the /r/Python mods. We have removed this post as it is not suited to the /r/Python subreddit proper, however it should be very appropriate for our sister subreddit /r/LearnPython or for the r/Python discord: https://discord.gg/python. The reason for the removal is that /r/Python is dedicated to discussion of Python news, projects, uses and debates. It is not designed to act as Q&amp;A or FAQ board. The regular community is not a fan of "how do I..." questions, so you will not get the best responses over here. On /r/LearnPython the community and the r/Python discord are actively expecting questions and are looking to help. You can expect far more understanding, encouraging and insightful responses over there. **No matter what level of question you have, if you are looking for help with Python, you should get good answers**. Make sure to check out the rules for both places. Warm regards, and best of luck with your Pythoneering!
I think they were trying to reply to my comment.
I agree, I was just trying to make an example.
I've heard of Sway, what is Wayland?
The "most notable difference" example really undersells python 3
Currently building a virtual pet for my girlfriend. My first project and super overwhelmed but having fun learning. Have some java experience from school but just made the switch to python
This looks cool but I get a syntax error when I run it for this line: `color = [*(int(color[j] * (1 - decay*((t - i + tl) % tl) / tl)) for j in range(3))]+[255]` &amp;#x200B; Is there something missing before that first asterisk?
I just used an example provided by the PEP without thinking too much about it. I do think your example shows a better usage of the assignment expression, and is probably the case in which I'll be using it the most.
I was thinking from a beginner's perspective: what is the one single difference that confuses beginners? I wasn't talking about the features of Python 3.
I think it's mostly a case of getting used to it. When I started learning python, list comprehensions seemed to make readability worse (they still do, if abused), but nowadays I think that, used well, they improve readability. Assignment expressions are a bit more controversial, but I think people will warm up to them eventually.
Yes, and also about "positional only functions" being defined as a / at the end of the argument list. Usually, you can somewhat tell what things do in python by reading the code, but something like / doesn't tell you at all what it's supposed to do. The best you can guess is that it's something related to parameters, since it's on the parameter list. I'm not part of the dev team so I don't what kind of challenges they faced to implement the "positional only" stuff, but if it were up to me, I'd probably try to implement it using a decorator: &gt;from whatever import positional\_function &gt; &gt;@positional\_function &gt; &gt;def foo(a, b): &gt; &gt;\#... The := is another example of this situation, but I find it less of a problem because it's similar to the common = operator, so it's more acceptable to me. This situation is not unprecedented in python. The unpacking of lists and dicts using stars, for example, is also too symbolic for my tastes, but it's already deeply ingrained into the language, so better just leave it...
You can use a Fourier transform to turn a discrete function into continuous also. Useful for interpolation
Was thinking about doing the same thing, thought the animation was cool. Nice job!
Works for me. &gt;&gt;&gt; import csv &gt;&gt;&gt; data = ['ham, ham|toast,eggs|spam'] &gt;&gt;&gt; list(csv.reader(data, delimiter='|')) [['ham, ham', 'toast,eggs', 'spam']] Get some example code with example data that demonstrates your problem and show it to /r/learnpython for help.
lol .. 49 .. yeah, right ... more than 3 should not be essential to learn something, or the resources are not worth it. you might need more later on, to deepen your understanding, but for learning that number is just crazy
thanks, will do
Fascinating. This is a quality post
Thank you for the feedback! It is definitely related! And it can be done in one line with `colp`: ``` &gt; red.interpolate(blue, 10) [HEX('#ff0000'), HEX('#e50019'), HEX('#cc0033'), HEX('#b2004c'), HEX('#990066'), HEX('#7f007f'), HEX('#660099'), HEX('#4c00b2'), HEX('#3300cc'), HEX('#1900e5'), HEX('#0000ff')] ``` I intend to implement the use case for many and not just one color argument in the future.

Go to this link. https://github.com/sukeesh/Jarvis . Maybe this repo will shed some light on your queries.
You need a python version higher than 3.5 I think. Or you can remove it an replace the brackets by `list`
A more modern alternative to X11. It solves some serious design warts, but hasn't fully standardized certain features yet (screenshots, network transparency, and mouse repositioning in particular). One of the earliest adopters of Wayland was actually auto manufacturers, who have been using it as an efficient UI for smart displays. Probably the most mature and production-ready Wayland compositor currently is GNOME-Wayland, which is indistinguishable from running on X for most people.

Try a basic `pd.read_csv` and `plot`, and show /r/learnpython your code and example data if you have questions.
If Fourier Transforms are universal function approximator why doesn't any machine learning algorithm exists which uses them? Or does it? This might be a good field to look into.
Thanks =)
I’ll give it a look, thanks!
The error is that that's invalid syntax. You meant to do this: from pygame.key import get_pressed But looking at your code that's not what you used. What you really need is this: import pygame Try /r/learnpython next time.
Agreed. The `pandas` module is your friend here.
I have from pygame.key import get_pressed and import pygame
My first program, a simple GUI using tkinter with loads of input boxes. Im going to use it when I'm checking fire alarms (battery measurements, detector testing, external equipment etc.) It is just a GUI notepad of sorts that will print all measurements and such in a txt file, so it gets easier to write the report afterwards.. When I started I thought it would be a page long, I'm now at 250 lines and counting.. adding checkboxes, text and explanations along the way makes it longer than expected.
ok. So it works, right?
ugh, figured it out. When I open the file straight to excel, it decides to use commas to delimit, on open. It's fine if I open it in text editor :/
As much as I love to shit on Excel, I can't really fault them for that. The "C" in "CSV" means "comma", after all.

No, I mean that is what I already have, if you look at the code I posted first.
pandas can read and write excel files as far as I remember
I think you need to look at it more carefully. Those lines are not there. `from pygame.key import get_pressed` is not the same as `from pygame import key.get_pressed`. `from pygame import *` is not the same as `import pygame`.
&gt;from pygame import key.get\_pressed But in deleting that I get a lot of errors due to not having the pygame module for key input
I tested the code you posted, and I don't. Show /r/learnpython those new errors and the code that causes them and we'll work on that.

If you asked your computer to rename a file to the name of an existing file then the existing file is wiped out of the FAT. In your program that may have happend if you already had some files in the pattern "cap_002.xcf" when you started. If it's super important you can try a program like photorec which tries to recover files without the FAT.
This is really cool! I will try it out. Thank you! If my little project comes to something I will let you know.

Ah, thanks for the info! So what are the reasons one would switch from x11 to Wayland (aside from just giving it a go like a lot of people would do)?

Smoother performance and improved security are the main potential benefits for end users right now.
Years ago, a friend and I wrote a program that generated random names, based on the probabilities of certain letter combinations. Probabilities were computed from source texts we found online (King James Bible, Beowulf, etc.). You could feed it texts in any language (in the ASCII character set), and it would then generate random words that sounded like that language (to someone not familiar with the language.) It worked pretty well if you used two-letter combinations. Some of the words were hilarious. More than two letters, it got weird.
could you give me an idea of how you wrote that, it sounds really interesting and id like to see how it would work

/u/GIGI_Klowen sorry for the delayed reply, but /u/tunisia3507 is correct. There are quite a few syntax changes and some differences in functionality.
This kid needs to get a life.
Fourier transformations approximate a function on a specific domain, but outside that domain the result is completely meaningless. They're good for approximately a large number of data points with a smaller number of amplitudes. It could be useful for certain kinds of machine learning, but more often you to want to learn a function that had reasonable values outside the domain defined by the training data.

This is is similar to going to a physics subreddit and saying "hey I don't know any physics or engineering, but could you tell me how to build a particle accelerator so I can prove my theory of everything?" What you want to do is doable, but you need to start out with smaller ambitions. I'd start out with /r/learnpython

Basically I just need to install uncompyle6 from the "uncompyle6-3.3.5-py2.6.egg" file on my desktop. what is a step by step way to do that?
Well no, I’m just asking what Python modules I would need to produce such an AI, I wasn’t asking for the code itself.
Neat. I'll try it out when I get home

That means you did not install python from the python.org . You have some other bundle, and you should not use pip, use whatever that bundle provides. For example is you installed anaconda, use the conda package manager. Or install the official python.
For this type of drawing, you need a single continuous path---so it's possible to do with any image but not trivial to skeletonize the edges of the image properly so they're all on one path.
python is ok for desktop but performance wise it can be slow
Hahaha did he expect me to code something

Sorry for the late response. Same as me with my project. I have no idea on how to do what I want to do. I just google stuff: any error messages I get, if I have an idea I google it to see if it was done before. If so, I try to understand the logic of it and I do it on my own without copy-pasting. Much better to learn that way. I end up sometimes copy-pasting stuff but I generally don't keep the code. What I do with it is put random variables or data inside what I pasted and play around it, try to understand how it works. For example: the "requests" Python module is used to grab the HTML pages of a website. I checked online, tried some codes, understood how it worked. Then, erased the whole thing and rely only on the documentation if I have any questions (Whats this function? What does it return? A tuple? A list?) I was completly lost when I first started Python. I took it as a game. It doesnt matter if I break my code or get stuck for a week on something. Patience and determination is key and I always find the solution to my problem in the end.
To ground Fourier transforms, I think the easiest examples to discuss are sound. OP already mentioned that they let you distinguish the different frequencies that compose a sound, but I'll give a few examples that make that even more specific. When you use an equalizer and "turn the bass up," the stereo system is doing something like taking the Fourier transform, turning up the amplitude of the bass frequencies, and then doing an inverse transform back to normal sound domain to play through your speakers. Autotune works by taking the Fourier transform to find the main frequencies that someone is singing, and then you can *shift* those pitches to the correct pitch, and again inverse transform back. MP3s are able to have lower file sizes than WAV by taking the Fourier transform and removing some redundant information in frequency-land. When it's played back you just do the inverse transform again. JPEG works exactly the same way, but now "high frequency" means "edges/corners" instead of "treble" and "low frequency" means "smoothness" instead of "bass."
Correct, see [PEP 448](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0448/).
If you have that anywhere, I'd love to try it.

I had the same thought except I did nothing with it! How high does n go for this example? Or how many n are there? I don't know how to ask this
I can try help but you havent given any details about the program. What's it meant to do?
It’s meant to be a character in a 9x9 room who can only move north south east and west. To the east is a locked door that can only be unlocked after the pie is retrieved from the orc. North of him on the wall is a painting and west is a mirror while south of him is a table with pie and an orc standing next to it
So a game?
So a game?
Indeed. Now would someone mind pointing me towards the royal road to number theory?
It is but I’m not using pygame or anything like that
[The French should be able to help you with that. ](https://youtu.be/BRn6ZhpIwZI)

Whats that?
My repo is private but happy to share with you if you want to trade info
This is a very broad question, how familiar are you with neural networks and machine learning? Look into Markov Chains (not a nn) and Recurrent Neural Networks.
i watched youtube videos so i get why it works and how it functions, just no idea where to start, i installed tensorflow on a venv but idk where to go from there
I would look at the tensorflow tutorials and really understand them. https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/
The app that removes clothes from images of women.
And some people are still using python2.7
We wrote that code on Amiga computers. That may give you some idea how long ago it was. The code is long gone. Maybe I'll whip up something in Python, if I can find the time.
- Even into the 1970s and 1980s, many people caught the Lisp bug -- and became devoted fans and evangelists. ----- there's a bit of that in this GIF file. - and today i sense some of the same excitement in people who love Python.
For one thing, that's not what you're "just asking". &gt; But I’m just posting here to find out what PyPI modules I will need to start producing it *and how to pull data from the internet and insert it into the agents code, as well as it being automatically(if possible) updated daily to give live results when asked.* But even if you were just asking which modules you would need, you can't just plug together some modules and voilà, you have your AI. You don't even know enough yet to know that you're asking for the moon. That's fine, everyone is there at some point. But you've got to walk before you can run here.
It's a programming language that can write files, so yes of course it can generate images. There's even all sorts of packages to help you along the way. They're just a short google away!
Can i ask why u r not using pygame. Is it graphical. Or do u want like a text based game?
I want it to be text based
I’m working on learning python. It’s a difficult task.
Oh, easy stuff. So if u want it to go through the computer's built in terminal u can do it all through the basic python libraries. Depending on how complex u want the user interaction to be you could do a majority of it with if-else functions. I recommend u make objects an classes with data that changes based on the actions of the game. If u want the user to save their game you could just use text document writing for a basic saving system but if its a short enough game i wouldnt worry about it.

That would be really helpful! I've been trying to port to PySide2 without any luck I'm afraid.
 From the earlier post ( and discussion ) https://old.reddit.com/r/pygame/comments/c3bpjq/what_are_some_of_the_best_or_most_popular_games/ i'm getting the feeling that it's impossible using Pygame to produce PNG files of similar resolution . . .
Or you could require `any(str.isupper, string) and any(str.islower, string)`
Kinda disappointed you didn't do dickbutt if I'm honest...
thank you! this worked
Is it only women? We need to start a gofundme to get it working for both sexes.
This is a odd question because I parse it to mean you are looking for an IDE of sorts to learn data science libraries on. To that end Jupyter may be a good bet. It will allow you to work with the referenced libraries and many more. As far as data science it’s self you probably will want to initially investigate all the potential solutions to see what fits your specific needs best. I’d start with the home sites for the various libraries and look for tutorial links.
A good starting place would be looking up some web scraping tutorials, and familiarize yourself with the BeautifulSoup4 Library. If you're looking to do something more complex, such as rendering html from an AJAX application, I believe the easiest way to do that is to build a simple rendering engine/browser with the pyQt library.

Jesus christ... reddit video sucks. It shows as just a blurry mess for me until I went back and checked it again later.
I understand the basic functions and so on but I am at a loss on what it should look like. I’ve got nothing to go off except a book I don’t really understand
Haven't tested that but syntactically it seems rather odd. You're correct in saying that `islower()` and `isupper()` are the better approach (I was unaware of those methods' existence) but they're string methods, and so calling `string.isupper()` for example returns a Boolean. The correct syntax for that would (I believe) be: if any([string.isupper(), string.islower(), not 1 &lt;= len(string) &lt;= 10]): print("Some kind of error") However, in this case there is little need to use an `any()` function at all. Using `any()` requires the creation of a list, which adds unnecessary overhead. `any()` is extremely useful for prexisting lists with a changing number of conditions, but almost useless (and a performance detriment) for known numbers of unchanging conditions like in this example. Hence, you'd be far better off with this: if string.isupper() or string.islower() or not 1 &lt;= len(string) &lt;= 10: print("Some kind of error")

Honestly ik this sounds cheesy but really its all about how u want to make it. Ig this now falls to a writing or gamemaking question. I guess you should figure out how the player is going to interact. What commands will be used, what the orc and pie do, etc. Im posting a link to the zork website. Idk if you have played zork before but its an old DOS text based rpg game. I think its pretty fun and it could give you an idea of how these text based games play. Heads up you will need to run this on the DOS box emulator. But i did a similar project to urs and the zork ganes helped me get and idea for the functionality atleast. http://www.infocom-if.org/downloads/downloads.html
What about the training data?
Hey how is the tool hunt going? Did you manage to take a look at my project?
My bad, I meant `any(map(string.isupper, my_string))` etc. I'm getting my languages mixed up. You can't just do `my_string.isupper()` though, because it requires all the letters to be uppercase.
Why do you want to use PyGame to make an animated GIF or PNG? Why not something made for the purpose?
you can easily find the encrypted models online but they'll release the unencrypted ones soon
What do they mean by maskdet and maskfin?
Awesome!
I have python installed and I have anaconda navigator and some different idle's I'm working with. Which is why I'm posting here. Maybe you guys can help me out since pythons big with automation.

Thanks, and don't forget to give suggestions!
&gt; I have a class A that imports objects periodically from class B. You can't **import** from a class, only from modules.^1 Best practice is not to perform imports "periodically", but once and once only at the top of your module. &gt; Class A and Class B are in separately modules. Why? Python is not Java and we don't follow the (silly) rule "one class per module". Unless the two classes are HUGE (like tens of thousands of lines each) you can put them in the same module. &gt; Now class B needs to import the Spacy module which takes a long time to load. Can you fix Spacy so that it isn't so slow? &gt; Can I import the Spacy module in class A just once and have class B use Class A’s Spacy import every time it needs to deliver objects to class A? This sounds like you're doing things in a really confusing way. But to answer your literal question, yes. At the top of class A's module, put: # moduleA.py import Spacy Then at the top of class B's module, put: from moduleA import Spacy but that's not going to make Spacy any faster. And it is a shockingly bad design: why on earth does moduleA import Spacy if it doesn't use it? Why does class A need class B to provide it Spacy? Your description suggests to me that your code is a tangle of confused and confusing interdependencies that will be a nightmare to debug. &gt; That way I can save load time of the Spacy module significantly by doing it only once. That's not how importing works in Python. Modules only load the once, however and wherever you import them. If it is taking a long time to load Spacy the second time, you must be doing something really, really weird, like deleting it from the module cache. I suspect that the load time for Spacy is not the bottleneck you think, but something else is slow, and you just think it is Spacy. Try this: - start the interactive interpreter - run `import Spacy` - run `import Spacy` again. The second time should be nearly instantaneous, no matter how long the first time takes. ^1 Actually that's not quite true, but if you're advanced enough to know how to create a fake module using a class, you probably wouldn't be asking these questions.
thanks for the comment. - i'm seeing this page : How to Make Gifs Using Python == superfluoussextant.com/making-gifs-with-python.html _________________ - i feel compelled to put a lot of text into the TITLE because Reddit GUI doesn't let me affix caption-text to an image post anywhere else.
This might be easier if you set up a server outside your restricted network. You could update your image in the website assets, and password protect access to the page that displays it. That way, you could update the image locally and not have to contend with whatever firewall/NAT layer your company has set up.
Single words don't have anything to do with [grammar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammar). I think what you are trying to do is generate words that sound somewhat English-like. You don't need a neural net for this. There's a million versions of [Markov Chains](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Markov_chain_text_generator) out there on the internet, to generate random words instead of sentences use individual characters instead of whole words. You can start here: https://duckduckgo.com/?q=markov+chain+name+generator+python Good luck!
THANK YOU FOR THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Send it over Telegram instead of email.
Using neural networks for this is like using a nuclear-powered bulldozer to crack a peanut.
I know but you learn best with projects
This is really cool! I like the video editing skills as well. Keep doing good things my friend!
No problem
~~JFC WTF is this crap~~ well at least it's not yet another one of those "How do I start learning Python...."
This episode is a story about packaging, and flit, tox, pytest, and coverage. And an alternate solution to "using the src". Python makes it easy to build simple tools for all kinds of tasks. And it's great to be able to share small projects with others on your team, in your company, or with the world. When you want to take a script from "just a script" to maintainable package, there are a few steps, but none of it's hard. Also, the structure of the code layout changes to help with the growth and support. Instead of just talking about this from memory, I thought it'd be fun to create a new project and walk through the steps, and report back in a kind of time lapse episode. It should be fun. Here are the steps we walk through: * 0.1 Initial script and tests * 0.2 build wheel with flit * 0.3 build and test with tox * 0.4 move source module into a package directory * 0.5 move tests into tests directory
&gt; You are talking non-sense. Spoken like [a true Blub programmer.](http://wiki.c2.com/?BlubParadox) &gt; Invoking functions directly is far easier to read than putting them in a list and then applying them over a loop. Wow, I just had a flashback to the 1990s, when one of my colleagues *insisted* that it was "far easier to read" initialisation code like this: # Translated from the original to Python-like pseudocode window.add_button(1) window.add_button(2) window.add_button(3) window.add_button(4) window.add_button(5) # skip dozens of lines... window.add_button(199) window.add_button(200) # and yes, there were this many buttons on the window compared to falling for the "hype" of using "unreadable" `for` loops like this: for i in range(1, 201): root.add_button(i) Your name's not Paul is it? Did you ever get paid by that client who owed you a year's worth of consulting fees? If you find it hard to understand a pipeline of function calls like this: result = initial_value for func in [unzip, strip, touch, finger, grep, mount, fsck, more, yes, umount, sleep]: result = func(result) I really don't know what to say. Do you unroll all your other loops too? result = unzip(strip(touch(finger(grep(mount(fsck(more(yes(umount(sleep(initial_value))))))) Oh wait, that's completely wrong. We have to write the functions in the opposite order that they are called: result = sleep(umount(yes(more(fsck(mount(grep(finger(touch(strip(unzip(initial_value))))))) and to understand the code, we have to read it backwards, from right-to-left. Yay for "more readable"!!!
Currently working on my first ever professional script! I convinced my department to allow myself and two others to use python to extract, transform, and load data files received from the field. What would take a team member several hours to weeks is now taking minutes to hours to produce, depending on complexity. Looks like we may finish the project on schedule instead of several months late! Couldn’t be happier to use the skills I’ve learned over the past 6 months.

So I'm currently putting my effort in writing in Country-cum-Place fetcher, parser, cleaner. That cleaned **20M+** detailed record of places will be cleaned up for generating a fresh **6.36M+** place record along with their corresponding URL, from which weather forecast of 9 days can be fetched . So also includes a weather fetcher and converter( from xml to JSON ). GitHub: https://github.com/itzmeanjan/countryAndWeather Would like to get some feedback :)
do you know some place where i could learn a bit more about it, it'd be an added benefit if they start from ground up, as i'm fairly new in programming
IIRC it didn't work on men because there just wasn't enough data. Not to say there will be. As horrible as it may sound I feel like taking it up a notch to be real-time and AR to light a fire under researchers' asses. I'm not smart enough to solve the problem, but I'm smart enough to get that kick started.

Praise the Lord.
When considering whether to use python for a project, your first question must be: "Is this performance critical?" If yes, don't use python. If no, the answer is usually yes, you can use python.
I just noticed that it adds a watermark, yeah, that won't help.
And this thread by association.
Impressive, i thought for sure there would be more code to the core of something of this complexity.
Cool! :)

The simplest PNG file format is so simple you can write a PNG output class in a dozen or so lines of code. Generating the data to output is also simple. Only the format itself limits the resolution of the image.
Real-time AR versions of this would quickly be made illegal i'd hope.
I got that problem. The solution was: -------------- python -m pip install pip==18.1 -------------- then just: -------------- python -m pip install -U pyinstaller It should work.
That’s horrible.
That's the point - check if they're all uppercase or lowercase, and if they're not, then they must be a mix of upper and lowercase, fulfilling the requirements :)
This.
Do you think, someone with malicious intentions could try to abuse my openhearted invitation? Many different folks meet up to work on projects, without knowing each other. I would make sure this would be a publicly available project, it has some potential to become subsidized
Am I the only person that think they should remove the watermark, and now from this day forwards anyone who fucked up and uploaded nude can now deny it? Like their are no real nude anyone just say it's fake like everyone else's.

Well I'm kinda a beginner in python(although I know most functions and stuff, I'm still new) and I have no experience in js , so I might not be the best person to answer this question, but here it goes. So I have been trying out this socket programming and I have made some progress, from what I can tell python can be used and is pretty efficient with those. Although I haven't tried it with a webcam, I think it would work very smoothly. It could also be added multiple other useful functions as well, which is kinda expected. If js functions better than python, you should ask yourself "Do I want it to function PERFECTLY?" If yes, use js. If not, use python, as python , from what I can tell, is a pretty lazy language; meaning you can write a code that has multiple dozen functions and it won't be that long. Sorry for the essay, especially since I'm not that experienced so I might have made huge mistakes.

Thanks for this, still haven't gotten around to stepping off python 2.7...
Not related to your question, but the `'cap_' + ... ` expression can be rewritten to `'cap_{:03}.{}'.format(count, exten)'`, eliminating the need for the `count` function in the process. In newer Python 3 versions, you could also use "f-strings" to make it even a bit more compact: `f'cap_{count:03}.{exten}'`.
Send me a photo of your mom
I cant believe people downvoted your comment, its awful.
Maybe that’s the (small) the silver lining here. Photos are still being treated as if they show some incorruptible truth, when in reality they never have. For as long as there were photographs there were means to alter them. The fact that this fakery now takes no more than the push of a button should make the last of us wake up to that. And maybe, maybe some day we'll no longer have to constantly worry that anything we do might end up on the internet, stripped of context. If you can’t tell if it’s real nobody will care.
I also saw this project on Coding Train (youtube)! It was written with p5.js
That's a completely different animal. If it ever appears, it will be another tool, not perfplot.
The folder structure that holds your css or config files is referenced somewhere in the docs. You can do: jupyter --paths at the command line and one of these folders will contain the location.
That's... Wonderful.

Currently for each element in the output list you sum all the values needed for it. This means for the first element you perform n additions (n being the length of the list), for the second element n-1 additions and so on. By thinking about how each output element is calculated and how they relate to each other, you can find a more efficient way how to calculate the next element from the previous one.

Hola, For your first `not_a_toy.py`, this looks like money! I wish you all the success in a sector that should reward you for your efforts in this thing. After having been there, I can imagine some 'tenders thinking themselves too good for such a thing, but it's only a matter of time before your app is given some mechanical hoses/arms... &gt;:D
Duh. That's not how it works. The person has to wear clothes in the first place for it to work.
my first solution was nested while-for loop and that makes complexity O(n\^2), I thought the solution above is more efficient but it also does not work
Impressive

Here's a real-world example of a single page. The functions called here are annotated with `@fragment` or `@component` (in the case of `admin_base`). `request` here is a Django Request object. @document def view_admin_post_overview(h, request): with admin_base(h, request, title='Blog posts', scripts=['post-overview'], events=True): with h.section(class_='action-bar'): yield h.a("New blog post", class_="action-button", href="new") yield searchbar() with h.section(): with filter_box(h, 'group'): yield "Group " with h.select(class_="filter-action", id="filter--group--input"): for group in get_relevant_groups(request.user, show_retired=True): yield h.option(group.name, value=group.id) yield created_filter() with filter_box(h, 'status'): with h.select(class_="filter-action", id="filter--status--input"): yield h.option('Published', value='published') yield h.option('Draft', value='not published') yield deleted_filter() yield add_filter(['Group', 'Date', 'Status', 'Deleted']) yield main_listing(Post, request.user) `@fragment` functions are equivalent to `@document` functions, except they don't add `&lt;!doctype html&gt;` to the top and can thus be inserted easily into other fragments or documents. `@component` functions are similar to fragments except you can put content inside them, and call them in a `with` or `for` header.

If you can do stuff like this, why would you look for a job in programming ?!? Go straight to the mechanical sector and make valuable machines!
Complexity is still O(n^2). The builtin sum function still needs to iterate over the (partial) list. Think about the iterations: First sum is over n elements, then n-1, then n-2, ... which according to Gauß is (n^2+n)/2. So still O(n^2). But if you've already summed up all input numbers for the first number you can just subtract the second input number from the first output number to get the second output number. Which means in each iteration you would only need to subtract once =&gt; O(n). You can optimise a bit further by starting at the back of the input list and keeping a running total.
I recommend asking stackoverflow for things like that. Most probably there is a nice solution already.
Plt.xlim([x1,x2]) and plt.ylim([y1,y2])
What the actual fuck. This is brilliant.
Wouldn't it have been better to notify that the photo is a deepfake by writing that in the image's header, or metadata?
That's amazing. How can you transfer Python code into Machine code? I'm curious to know how does your machine understand the Python code.
Illegal open source software. Yeah, that’ll work..:

Solid! I think this is the best way to learn it, see what else you could improve for yourself and then learn how to fix it with Python. Then you could open-source it to help others with the same problem!
They're using a Raspberry Pi (see the 'sideview' image), which has controller I/O that interfaces with the -- presumably -- motor thingies extruding the liquids.
I'm no legal expert but the question is why or how would this be illegal? I guess maybe if there's a law existing against watching nudity in public e.g. Porn on your phone, then you could argue on that. If it's a fake then it's not an actual picture of a person's nudity. I'm just trying to see how one would argue for or against this if it came to a real application. Just to be clear I would definitely not want anyone to look at me through "nude-enabled Google goggles" and wouldn't want to use it either. BTW these phone apps have existed in the European market for some time as a gimmick, maybe not as sophisticated.
Post?
Well the issue with the real time ar ones is you could do it to anyone and then save it as an image. High schoolers are bound to use it on eachother for bullying purposes which will raise child pornography concerns. Then there will also probably be actual pedophiles using them on kids. So even if they didnt completely ban the software it'd definitely be in a legal gray area from the get-go. I imagine it could also fall under sexual harassment laws.
That's a fucking awful reality we and the justice system will have to deal with very quickly.
I tried it on pornstar "Aria Nina". If this breaks rules, feel free to delete my comment mods. NSFW: https://i.redd.it/hebwzqhfio831.png
It might be possible to wear clothes that give off some sort of light outside the visible spectrum that cameras would pick up so anyone trying to take an image of you would have that to deal with.
This has just made me lose all faith in humanity....
Finally something worthy to try on my new gpu
Exactly, since the pumps need higher voltage than the pi provides, the pi controls different relays which switch to a second power circuit to power the pumps. The raspberry pi supports many program language so that's not big problem.
White-Hat AI vs Black-Hat AI incoming. Anyway, we need awareness and defenses.
I am currently working in such a sector (have been for some time) but there are many topics which I don't like and I'd actually love to spend more time coding and less time doing other things. But I will see, thanks anyway for the heads up!
I wouldn't call it brilliant, but it's a good start. Still many things which I want to add or improve.

Hi, ich bin ein Master Student in angewandter Informatik. An deiner Stelle würde ich versuchen, einen Job zu finden der beides kombiniert. Denn was reine Entwicklung angeht programmiert man (leider) oft das selbe. CRUD Apps, die nur minimal andere Dinge tun. So isses zumindest meiner Erfahrung nach. Besonders spannend ist das nicht wenn ich ehrlich bin.
Nope... Let's wait for web assembly.
yep - a wealth of libraries to solve almost any problem. Guido has stepped down as BDFL, correct?

The article has code for both PyQt5 and PySide2 (Qt for Python)... if you're interested to see what else you can create, I've also got a little [library of custom widgets](https://www.learnpyqt.com/widgets/).
It's not bad for being automated. Also I'm sure if I used better pictures, it could have been a better example. I just wanted to test it out real quick and those were the first 2 pictures I tried.
Cant you just sum all list entries for the first sum and then subtract the first entry from that sum for the second result, then the second entry for the third result and so on. That way you wouldnt need to iterate over the whole list for every entry
There’s probably a good case to be made that this is against github’s TOS. They should remove it

Have been working a lot with Google Vision AI API recently and found the need to build something to quickly download images from the web to my Google Photo album. Eventually I will share the source code once they are ready.
Or, if you’re using the Object Oriented interface (which I think is a better way to work) it’s `ax.set_xlim([a,b])` Also, to OP, this was a very easily searched solution. Part of becoming “good” at any computer language is to learn how to search first
Ah, good point, I didn't think about doing it that way. However, a password with no letters would pass your test too.

A refrigerator for the input beverages?
Would this even be possible? Adapting is basically the defining thing that Generative Adversarial Networks are good at.
No because that isnt as obvious to people looking at it.
For a fixed model most definitely. These deepnude models are not changed after training although you may have many pretrained models in the wild.
But the model wont actually be fixed. It surely takes longer to develop hostile clothing than it does to retrain the network.
Once you calibrated the pumps (they may differ by 10%, even they are the same model) the calculated volumes are quite accurate, so the program calculates the volume by time = volumeflow/volume. This works surprisingly well, at the end, when you should have used all volume (the Programm knows the size of the bottles), the bottle is usually empty as well. Only fluids with soda like cola, may differ a little bit, you may end with 10% remaining Cola when the program indicates the bottle is empty.
Who says we can't find attacks against whole families of neural networks, regardless of the weights?
I joked about that topic yesterday, to include some cooling method to the bottles, may happen some day

I'm writing some Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence code for my school, it's a little repository written entirely in Spanish so students at my school can learn about this algorithms in their own pace. I try to use as little dependencies as possible except for the Artificial Intelligence methods, I need to use TensorFlow for that part.
It's to test if you actually understand the material without an IDE or Google
It's not Python, but [SICP (Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs)](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-4.html#%_toc_start) dedicates the whole first chapter to recursion and iteration. Note while the examples and exercises in that chapter could be done in Python, there is a fundamental difference between Scheme, the language SICP uses, and Python: Scheme guarantees tailcall elimination, also referred to as "tail call optimization" or "having proper tail calls". This means loop constructs on the syntactic level are not necessary as a core part of the language, as they can be expressed using tail(-call) recursion, giving the same space complexity as loop constructs built into the language would give (i.e., without blowing up the stack).
In a way, recursion is not the best approach in python, given its stack frame limit, and lack of tail call optimisation. Not to say there's no point doing recursion at any point, especially if you know it's not going to go too deep. Converting recursive algorithms in to iterative ones will yield (pun intended) better results. If you want to learn recursion, a functional language like Haskell, where recursion is absolutely fundamental, could be a good place to start. Haskell's recursion works so much like it would in a mathematical inductive proof, and is such a pure way of expressing that kind of logic that once you understand it there, you'll be able to apply your knowledge to your python, but converting it in to iteration.
Misleading title: the download is manual, poking around in it is done with Python, and it's only the location data.

That is pretty fucking cool
I’ve used pyWavelets: https://pywavelets.readthedocs.io/en/latest It seems to work pretty well.
VoIP softswitch (with 15-year history). Continuing to make it work with Python3.6. Stumbled on some tests extensively using unittest.mock. Methods like `assert_not_called` were used despite they were not included into the service method set and mocked instead, so they used to give silent false positives. With 3.6 they are finally imported into the `mock` module and so tests get broken. Iʼm cursing `mock` developers that havenʼt provided a guaranteedly separated naming policy for service methods. Trapped into a problem with cyclic imports appeared from combination of three bad decisions - 1) move a whole implementation of a class into packageʼs `__init__.py`, 2) explicit using of upper levelʼs definitions at this class, 3) using of submodule of package from (1) in that upper level. The appearance of error with this cyclic import depends on import order over all the project and its diagnosing exposed a heisenbug. So, the localʼs council decided to untangle this by moving the main package class to an own file and explicit importing of it. Unfortunately, the bigger problem with logical layering inverse will remain for a while. Successfully removed a great hack from some modules. The hack had been invented to generate some identifiers from random byte source. The `os.urandom` method is present since Python 2.4 but nobody of previous contributors had been able to read the entire `os` module documentation page where this method is at the very end. So Iʼve removed reading /dev/urandom, calling openssl rnd, and so on.
Okay so after 70 hours of rendering only 800 decent looking 1920x1080 images for my mandelbrot zoom I have come to realize the need for numpy and numba. How long did it take you to get comfortable with those two libraries? Are there any good resource in particular you recommend?
Grand. Thanks.

On our transition experience, I'd strictly suggest using an intermediate stage - code that works identically for 2.7 and 3.x. The `six` module is good for providing most of auxiliary definitions and functions for maintaining such compatibility. When you fix all related issues with packaging, server infrastructure and so on, you will be able to drop support for 2.7 and move on to only-3.x. The problem with this is that there is no automated sixizer (or, I donʼt know it). `2to3` is good for detecting large part of issues but not for converting itself. For example, `print` mode converts print operators, but you will have to add import of `print_function` to each affected file. `dict` replaces `iteritems` to `items`, but you would need `six.iteritems` in some cases... and so on. Many issues aren't detected by (widespread) converters at all: this includes socket I/O and hashlib (byte strings are required), removal of cmp(), stricter comparisons (e.g. `1 &lt; None` is just False in Py2 but raises exception in Py3), style of Exception arguments, bad mocking of open()... The most weird case I've faced was passing `pickle` output through environment variables without text-safe encoding (like base64). In general, you should be ready to keep dual-version-ready code for at least one major code release (or deployment-and-feedback cycle, if this is more appropriate for your company's policy) and regularly run full test set against Python3.
Congrats on your work. Yea, it would be really nice to post your GitHub or a portion of your code along with your movie. Maybe the downvoting has been because you didn't share the code (you're posting in r/Python). If it's good enough to show off, should be good enough to show?
Thanks for the detailed reply! Started porting a few of the scripts yesterday and it all works well. The scripts are part of a tool that my company has partly customised for themselves and the devs of the original tool had provided good backwards support for 2.7 and overviews over changed plugins, so it was much more straight forward than I thought

You can have the longest and most random password ever if you reuse it and it leaks once then you're done for. Making passwords not easy to remember doesn't try to fight cracking, it fights reuse.

I don't get it, is that supposed to be a joke, I love python, but surely javascript is more standard right?
That's a clever way it worked thanks a lot! Do you know some way to write code more efficient other than practicing such problems?
&gt; oh, I use python and think it's great actually. It's still a shit language in the sense that there is a lot that could be improved however! That's a shit comment.
I misthought about the complexity issue, thanks for clarifying !
my guess is they are like recruiters and they really meant java instead of javascript.
sorry sweetheart
Amazing
Glorious!!!
"Standard for what?" Is the correct question.
That makes far more sense, it really pisses me off when people confuse java and javascript
Thats dope man! Keep up the good work
Thanks!
Before spending a lot of money on a bootcamp just buy python crash course by Eric Matthews on amazon You don't need a bootcamp to learn python but if after that book you still don't understand python then go to it but highly doubt that you wont understand python after going through the book I did and now i have been creating my django project for the last 2 weeks the book took me about 3 weeks to finish 2hours a day.
&gt;"Standard for what?" Technology, of course... Keep up!
Cool! So why not Mayavi?
Thanks, I wanted to do everything myself, because as a beginner, I'm trying learn more about programming
In general: get to know the standard library and use builtin functions. And when you go over your code to optimize it, check if what you do in each step is necessary and if what you are calculating has not been done before (lilke it was here) or is not even needed at all.
I don't quite understand (and currently on mobile so can't fire it up to mess with it) what this does, it creates animated renders from scratch? Or you can also use a render made previously and make a video animation with it?
Yeah, it creates animated renders from scratch (It doesn't make the gif, too, it only saves the frames)
I posted this as a joke yes, because I always think it's fun when someone says that Python is better than something else (even in cases when it's not), that's just my type of humor. But in the show, they were talking about an app for a smartphone, and to my knowledge, those aren't the preferred languages for app development. I've seen it's possible to make apps with both, but I've never heard that any of those were the standard. So either they messed up between the languages as u/39_fc mentioned, or they just googled most popular programming languages and went with that, without further research.
Yes that is very funny how when you Google "most popular programming languages" it shows a list with 1:javascript, and 2:python
Yes it is a bit dissapointing that they didn't look any further into it... But then again, it was just for that scene, the rest of the show hasn't got much to do with programming and such anyways.
They're not the same?? :P
In fact they're talking about a mobile app, so it would most probably be in Objective-C/Swift or Kotlin/Java. Not sure it's even possible to have a mobile app in python...
!remindme 1 day
I've read that it is possible, but I don't think it is as effective as e.g. Java
"BUT IT HAS JAVA IN THE NAME, OF COURSE THEY'RE RELATED", etc.
I strongly disagree but I'll still upvote purely out of pity
Embarrassingly getting those two confused has got to be a right of programming passage.

Of course it is: Kivy and BeeWare being the two of which I can think off the top of my head.
That's not the python way. The python way is to use python for something that it's not meant to be used for, implementing a bunch of janky workarounds, nested in exceptions, effectively creating a beautiful ticking time bomb of awful code that will instantly break if you update any dependencies. At least that's how I do it.
With os.system() probably not. The standard library subprocess module, however, is more powerful and allows you to write to the standard input of the created subprocess.

&gt;You can't have something that's shit and still great. Certainly, you can. OP's first claim was an attempt at an objective statement. The second claim was an opinion ("think it's great").
One way to reverse engineer a web session is by using a browser with the developer tools installed. Go to the network tab, listed there will be the requests, headers and contents that your browser sent and using that info you can recreate those requests in a program. In particular the session elements will be in the headers.
I interpreted it as the guy desperately wanting to use Python instead of JavaScript so he's trying to persuade everyone that Python is the standard even if that's not actually true.
The problem with that is anything evaluated by javascript execution when the page is rendered will simply be unavailable. Front-end security like cloudflare is easier to bypass loading the page with a webdriver than manually evaluating protected javascript when downloading page data via requests. Simple requests are fine 80% of the time but this code is to help with the sites that have more security.

If you are not joking than, java is kinda like python, and javascript is really an advancement to html
Hahaha it totally is, when I was learning how to code I picked java, because I thought it'd be like js.processing
Are you upvoting him or me?
I mean...they got to be the same, both have 'java' in the name.
which part?
Goodbye to magic scopes, let me define where my variable comes into existence and goes out thanks.
Can confirm. I asked my friend "what is the standard for technology?" And he said "Java!" So I think /u/3nigma42 is correct.

Maybe just to simplify things Groovy and Javascript can just switch names and it'll put an end to all of this.
Amen.
Or the joke is they are trying to be hip and with it and all the youngins are talking about python

Go fucking look at it for god's sake. There's an entire section called LEARNING RESOURCES. Don't be lazy.
That's not an improvement, that's just static programming. If you want that, change languages. Your preferences are not improvements, they're preferences

Car is to carpet as Java is to Javascript
You should just not answer questions at all.
Lol, this is why you don't let business people make technical decisions.
Exactly. ;-) Apparently, the story is that Brendan Eich wanted to call it "LiveScript" but Java was so popular at the time that he was overruled and it became the scripting language for Java applets and components, aka "JavaScript".
Reinstall python. Make sure you check the box to install for all users on the very first page of the installer. I have no idea why the Python installer refuses to add binaries to the path unless that's checked.

Where is python installed and what is your current PATH set to?
I see how it could be read that way, that is not what I meant to say
You have to remember that for 99% of people it doesn't matter at all. They literally don't know or care to know the difference anyway.
_NONE_ of that compares to the atrocity of seeing a female nipple.
What are the colors? Do you simulate both the E field and the H field? Or is this just the scalar wave equation? What are the boundary conditions?
Thank you very much!! it worked , i was wondering for solution for 3 days , even on stackoverflow no one answered a valid solution. Thanks!! you saved my time .
they mention actual programming in a show and not a guy mashing a green screen? Damn
When attempting to reinstall, it won't allow me to check the install for all users box. it says that it requires elevation.
Or you can just be happy for him and not spew hate on a wholesome post.
Looks like all stars to me?
Thanks so much!!!! I mised that on my first install. I never thought to reinstall for some reason. You are a life saver!!!
I feel personally attacked.
it would be nice if they made a type of pythonscript for browsers that didnt suck like javascript
Yes
Really? Instead of getting pissed off by the fact that they have such a confusing names instead? Honestly I don't get it. The fault is not on the side of people that casually confuse the two (I am talking about the people that are not professionals of course) but on the side of Javascript creator. From Wikipedia on Javascript : &gt; The final choice of name caused confusion, giving the impression that the language was a spin-off of the Java programming language, and the choice has been characterized as a marketing ploy by Netscape to give JavaScript the cachet of what was then the hot new Web programming language.
Wa? It's great!
Wat? https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat
Not from a programming perspective, no. TBH most of these programs that you see won't actually automatically create the path, people will typically take artistic license and create the path manually. The path is in 2-D, but has to be parameterized by a time variable---in other words, this just means the edges that get drawn have a beginning and an end and doesn't jump anywhere in the path. So most people will find some way to define this path, i.e. a list of points that go in order, or similar. You *can* automatically do this but it's hard. For an example why, suppose you have two lines that are disconnected. Well, you can't have disconnected lines so you have to find some way to connect them. If the lines are AB and CD, well you can connect AC or AD or BC or BD...which one is "correct"? Now you've entered the land of cost functions and optimization.
Definitely possible, but not really the right tool for the job... JS makes sense at least in that context, see: React Native.
Python on WASM might be a thing soon. That would be nice at least.
I'll be using Trinket.io I think. Either that or get it running on my website. Haven't done that yet. Need to learn flask.
java&gt;Python&gt;javascript standard wise is how I get it, its not how good each one compared to the other. It is its more of how they are used, correct me if I am wrong.
Due to electron, I much rather sublime text...
On Reddit, if you have text to go with your image, you make a regular post and include a link to the image.
PyCharm and VS Code are my preferred editors. I like PyCharm slightly better.
I am really enjoying vs code, everything that I needed worked right out of the box and with a few easily installed plugins. I work with a lot of Jupiter notebooks and do a lot of analysis/data science stuff so the built in interactive python feature is great. I’ve also tried pycharm and found it was really good with exception of the scientific projects. It would always freeze on me or something would crash.

Sublime
So we're pretending people aren't doing end to end js these days? Because I'm cool living in that world and all, but it's not this one.
Aren't all phone apps in JavaScript?
Thank you for the suggestion :)
Thanks pal :)
not ide :( Just want to learn those libraries from the best platform :)
Or NodeJS
I’d say start in PyCharm then after you get the hang of things and more understanding of what you are doing, loom at moving to VScode
Fetuchiniboard?
Depends. If it's embedded in a website, then it's JavaScript. If it's more backend scripting, Python. If it's important backend stuff, it's Go.
Pycharm, Sublime Text or Vim.
Sorry I took so long. Here's the code: [https://github.com/jrmiranda/fdtd](https://github.com/jrmiranda/fdtd) :)
The colors represent the intensity of the E-field in a TE mode.
Great idea haha
No. JavaScript is not for apps. Perhaps you mean java for Android. Java is not JavaScript.
That title makes no sense. If the http client is a browser driven by Selenium, then the http client is not Requests.
Thanks for all your answers ^^
that's the point of the article. using a browser driven by selenium to perform some tasks that establish session data and then deriving a requests instance from that browser, retaining session information
Cool, TIL What's the difference? Or is it something rather complicated to explain?
You should start with python IDLE because it let you understand how things works (specifically talking about indentation).
i can't understand, is sublime text free? there is a paid version but at the same i there is not "trial version".
It is fine you can run 32 bit into the 64 bit system.
Java = JSON = JavaScript
different languages. not related at all.
i know but the 64-bit versions are allways run faster.
Checkout the file section in this link: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-373/
I think there is no 64bit version
I heard Kivy is the most popular solution for developing mobile apps with Python. My research on it has not been extensive, so you will have to conduct you own inquiries
what is the difference between: Windows x86-64 embeddable zip file Windows x86-64 executable installer and Windows x86-64 web-based installer?
Different installation methods. I always use Windows x86-64 executable installer.
thank you :)
Cross platform apps can be made with JavaScript. Facebook &amp; Instagram apps were made using React Native ( a JavaScript framework for cross platform apps).
Not really no. Native apps are in decline for a while now.
Cars can have carpet in them, so JavaScript is in Java?
Think of it like Wii and Wii-u.
It's not free. Sublime Text has an unlimited free trial with nagware every 15 saves asking you to purchase a license, but you can just click ignore or cancel.
Thank you so much

Maybe you should educate them so that when they do answer questions you find them more accurate/helpful.
I personally use Pycharm for all python programs and automation. Then i switch to VSCode for Django projects due to a better html/css editoe
Yes! But I’ll try: The phrase that first comes to mind is “_Java_ and _JavaScript_ are similar in the way that _Car_ and _Carpet_ are alike”. JavaScript is most well known for powering web pages. It’s runs “front end” code on your browser (form verification, number formatting, animations, streaming media, etc). Odds are that every web page you visit runs JavaScript. Java is the language for code that gets compiled to run on the JVM (Java Virtual Machine), which can itself be “run anywhere” such as servers, desktops, mobile (Android), and embedded systems. Windows, Mac, and Linux all have an implementation of the JVM and can run java applications. Java can power web applications on the backend to _serve_ web pages, but Java code itself does not run _within_ web pages. Minecraft is written in Java, as are lots of enterprise desktop software suites and web applications (think of a large bank or government website). All native Android applications are coded in Java. This is changing. There’s a sort of _Rule 34_ joke about anything and everything software eventually being rewritten in JavaScript. Node.js is a good example of JavaScript being implemented as a backend language and there are even multiple browser-based Minecraft implementations!
I feel seen
Asbestos was really an advancement to home construction.
Java is to Javascript as car is to carpet
Not nice
What effectiveness do you mean? Because for the 7 years i've programmed in java i have found to be very ineffective in terms of pure development speed, bloated and also legacy by now. Java had it's time in the 90's and 2000's. There are so many better options now...
Actually, [yes: Mozilla Rhino](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/Rhino)
This isn't really what you want but Pyshell ( https://www.npmjs.com/package/python-shell ) is what I use if I want to run python script in my web applications.
That probably gave him faith.
This is very inspiring! I really want to do something with a raspberry pi. Do you mind sharing some of the failures you had in the beginning? :)
I've done it with python and kivy.
Yeah you keep saying that but I take “platform” to mean something other than the libraries themselves. An IDE or an environment like Jupyter are types of platforms. By the way Jupyter is hard to classify as it isn’t an IDE persay, I’m not sure what you would call it. However what is important is that a lot of people in the sciences are using Jupyter and the libraries that interest you. Search around and you will find tutorials and example code.
Thanks for the explanation. I'm guessing by "TE mode", you mean you set the z (propagation direction) derivatives in Maxwell's equations to 0, and assume Ez = 0. The only reason I mention this is that I'm curious what the propagating, time-harmonic solutions look like. But I realize frequency-domain would be better for that.
The word you're looking for is pythonic :p
As someone who loves Flutter, I like hearing this...
I think this will give you the product data without needing to scrape: https://pypi.org/project/python-amazon-simple-product-api/
No problem. Actually the E field is zero in the xy plane since in transverse electric mode there's no electric field in the direction of propagation. The value plotted is the z component.
I haven't used auto-py-to-exe, but I see that it is a wrapper for pyinstaller. I would recommend as your needs get more complex to just use pyinstaller directly. Lots of people use pyinstaller and it supports everything you've mentioned without too much difficulty. You can ask for help in the pyinstaller issue tracker on GitHub, on Stack Overflow, or on r/learnpython. Sorry if this isn't directly helpful - I just wanted to give some encouragement and point to some other places that may be better suited to provide help.
For the first 10 or so years, it was a monolithic python app with a custom ORM (called EZ; later rewritten on top of SQLalchemy and renamed EZAlchemy), the Cheetah HTML templating engine, and a several thousand line utility file named yelpy.py. Several thousand stateless HTTP workers running under Apache (originally mod_python, later mod_wsgi), backed by a bunch of MySQL databases. Batch processing jobs ran under an in-house distributed job executor named Tron. Search was a custom Lucene-based thing but I think it’s just ES now. I’m sure it’s gotten much more complex in the last 7 years since I worked on it, though. Gotta justify 10x headcount increase somehow.
r/dataisugly ...
No mention of the mainframe or a firewall either.
&gt; What's the difference? One is a cool scripting language. The other would be an unused joke except that some idiot browser developers decided to bake it into all our shit and never look back.

Did you miss CSI's "I'll create a GUI interface (sic) using Visual BASIC; see if I can track an IP address"? For your sake, I hope you did....
Come onnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn WebASM!
This guy knows how to Python
I love and code both JavaScript and Python. Writing parallel programming in Python is a bit difficult for me, whereas callbacks, promises in JavaScript does the trick for me.
Thanks for your advice man , however now I am okay with this application too ,as i messed up more with this . But I have an issue directly from pyinstaller , my python script contains import for vlc(i.e python-vlc) And , whenever I make the exe of my script , the console returns bunch of error ,mainly for import error. I don't how to fix it , so do you have any idea about this?

Except the fact that Javascript was christened with the express intention of piggy backing on Java popularity at the time. The intention was that devs would get confused with the name and feel confident about being able to code in Javascript - even if they have no idea what javascript really was.
You could write it in C if you really wanted to: [https://expertise.jetruby.com/android-ndk-using-c-c-native-libraries-to-write-android-apps-21550cdd86a](https://expertise.jetruby.com/android-ndk-using-c-c-native-libraries-to-write-android-apps-21550cdd86a)
To be fair you could technically just use sys.exec to do the same thing, hardly a need for even more node packages.
Could it be referring to a server back end?
Not strictly true. Sure, you get access to memory beyond the 4GB limit, but that doesn't mean faster. In fact, 64 bit programs can often be slower, as many of the stored variables are now twice the size. This means it takes more time to copy them from ram to cache to CPU, and the cache can hold fewer variables (it really depends on how the program is coded). Many games will see no increase whatsoever. Some applications will get faster because their variable size is hard coded, but they can exploit the fact that there's twice as many available CPU registers (so fewer cache hits). You see this with things like video encoders and compression software. That mostly relies on a well optimized compiler :)
God gave you vim, why would you spit in his face?
nor Visual Basic
Isn't that Javascript?
Yes possible, there have been javascript interpreters in the core lib for quite a while. Rhino used to be the one, but I think it is replaced with V13 with something else.
/r/learnpython and read the sidebar. goddamn.
This is very cool. The wavelength of the EM fiels seems quite large (of the order of magnitude f the size of the lens and chamber): it seems more in the radiowave range rather than visible-light.
&gt;the guy desperately wanting to use Python instead of JavaScript so he's trying to persuade everyone that Python is the standard even if that Actually there are a number of languages which are nice, Typescript for instance and that one compiles straight to javascript. Kotlin also which compiles straight to Javascript but kotlin has the downside that you will need a runtime lib which does a lot of things js can do anyway (like inheritance) In the end the future probably will be on the Webassembly side with High level languages 2 Web Assembly compilers. But the quirkyness of javascript is one thing the other problems are dom and CSS in the browsers which add an additional layer of problems. I dont think replacing one quirky untyped language with another quirky untyped language with other problems really solves the issues of modern day web development. For instance I have moved literally all my web based projects to typescript to get the additional typed safety layer and better syntax I would not even remotely think of going back to an untyped language once a project hits a certain size. Also pythons block intentation becomes more and more of a burden once projects become bigger and add a certain number of developers, the same goes for the lack of multiline comments. Python however has its merits in being more structured than Javascript in many other things and many of its libs are outright excellent. But if I really would want a different language for the web I would definitely look into non python options and maybe would go full WASM once the compilers are in place instead of going for an interpreted language.
I was like “Well...” until the last paragraph. I had a recruiter ask me the difference between Java and JavaScript a few years ago as a screening question but I forget what my answer was. I’m not sure what I would say today. I don’t know if I know enough about Java to answer that question. Maybe that JavaScript’s OOP is just syntactic sugar while OOP is the very foundation of Java? And maybe mention the JVM? idk
Re-usable notebooks usually start with a headline, a "by ..." line, and a markdown description of what they do and how to use them. That said, it is very unlikely that during a job interview someone will look at some old Jupyter notebooks you wrote as a student, especially if they were a group effort. Employers are interested in what you can do, not what you have done. Your name on a piece of software (without history or context) does not prove anything.
Instagram and Spotify have their backends built in Python, if that counts.
We already lost GVR over this pointless debate. Let’s put it to bed.
&gt; What I'm noticing is many of my books/classes start with things like "this is a variable." and all of a sudden move to "now create a program that remotely connects to a computer and pulls data from a folder". I feel there's this massive leap that I just haven't been able to make. Hah, yes, that's the curse of techies who think they can write but can't get past the [Curse of Knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_knowledge). I like to describe this as ["And now you have muffins!"](https://northernplanets.blogspot.com/2007/11/internet-tutorials.html) syndrome. You have my sympathy, but I don't have much in the way of recommendations. I can recommend [Learning Python](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-python-5th/9781449355722/). (P.S. if you care about authors, please don't buy from Amazon if you can avoid it.)
**Curse of knowledge** The curse of knowledge is a cognitive bias that occurs when an individual, communicating with other individuals, unknowingly assumes that the others have the background to understand. For example, in a classroom setting, teachers have difficulty teaching novices because they cannot put themselves in the position of the student. A brilliant professor might no longer remember the difficulties that a young student encounters when learning a new subject. This curse of knowledge also explains the danger behind thinking about student learning based on what appears best to faculty members, as opposed to what has been verified with students. *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Python/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28
These are for a physics course I'm developing, so if I'm ever up for a job at another university I'll be showing off the notebooks as part of the curriculum development. Thanks for the tip!
If you're trying to save time, it may be easier to just use third-party tools. * [https://linux.die.net/man/1/pdftotext](https://linux.die.net/man/1/pdftotext) * [https://github.com/madhav-datt/spell-check](https://github.com/madhav-datt/spell-check) I did some quick searching for Python libraries for both of these functions and it seems like more trouble than it's worth (at least in your situation).
Very cool!
Sure, you can use requests + BeautifulSoup4 or selenium if the data is generated from JavaScript
You have a Python interpreter on an embedded system? Interesting, I would've figured C or Assembly would be more appropriate. What's the hardware look like?
Except the writers of CSI made all their techno babble hilariously absurd on purpose. It was an ongoing injoke.
I suspect that "in joke" was made up after the fact. It was pretty clear the writers actually had no fucking clue how any kind of actual science, technology, or forensics work. The show was 100% just coproganda anyway.
