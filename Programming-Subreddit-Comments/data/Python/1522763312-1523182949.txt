Thank you bot :).
Looks free to me. Am I missing something?
Could you explain what you're trying to do at a higher level? E.g. one possibility I'd guess from your description is taking 24-hour windows of A, and finding their best fit within the whole of B, to have a pile of separate offsets for where each day of A best fits within B?
Yes store the start and end time. Then you can calculate the value of the timer at any given time. Then put the same start/end values in your HTML or JSON response and let a bit of JavaScript pick that up on the client side. Then in JS do the same calculation and UI update in a loop (via requestAnimationFrame probably). You'd get a small difference between the two but the backend but that's fine.
Won't help. The underlying problem is that most people simply don't care to learn. The medium by which the information is transferred won't make much of a difference. Call me a pessimist (I'm not), but let's call a spade a spade, here. 
Take some college math classes. 
A high-elf cleric of the Life domain, to be exact. I'm currently 3rd level, and the character automatically updates spell slots and domain spells based on the cleric level as well.
For Windows stuff with C extensions things changed somewhat significantly from 3.4 to 3.5 I think. From 3.5 on things are supposed to settle down I think with it not being quite as critical which visual studio version is used? There was a great article (by Brett Cannon?) back when 3.5 was new about the recent changes to Microsoft's Visual C compilers. This is the reason for example that PySide and other libs won't be supported on 3.5+ since the effort to get it working with a new compiler setup isn't worth it in light of other developments (PySide not supporting Qt5 leading to PySide 2, etc....). Also, changes to how importlib works caused a library I was using, Esky, to no longer work on 3.5. Transitioning my stack away from PySide and Esky to PyQt5 and PyUpdater was a significant effort for me, but I'm finally on 3.6 now! Being on 3.6 also gives me access to things like the latest Jupyter Notebook version which isn't in the condo repos for 3.4. Anyways...
Unless I'm reading something wrong there's no indication from OP that he wants a single binary. Docker was originally built for cases exactly like this one. What's so bad about recommending the technology that suits the requirements perfectly?
Anyone ever tried to merge patient demographic data? Working on a way to provide a single source of truth for patient information and, hoooboy, it is a non\-obvious problem. I'm actually pretty close to concluding that without biometrics, such truth is actually nearly impossible to solve computationally. Demographic data can simply never be trusted. Birthdays can be wrong, names can be identical, not everyone has a Social Security number, and sometimes, sometimes, people actually want their information to be separate. I actually spent some time last night thinking about how storing anonymized health data in a blockchain, where you're given a QR code that links to your place in the chain for info might actually be our best way to share health data without having an "owner" per se. But then I realized I was thinking about the blockchain and laughed at myself and then I felt bad being laughed at :\)
Once again working on my [mini-frame](https://github.com/jdavidrcamacho/mini-frame) and trying to see if everything is working as it is supposed to.
Neither, I'd say check out fast.ai. Best courses I've ever taken. Also completely free with no ads and decent forum community. 
It's someway between INI and JSON. I like it.
True, but I'd noticed a pattern of projects born on Github, published to Pypi, and with descriptions that were completely unformatted markdown.
I have about 1300 photographs categorised into four folders/categories.
https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/
There's two options. One is free and another is $99. The only difference is with the $99 option you get an official transcript you can put on your resume. The free version has everything the paid version does, you're only paying for the certificate
I didn't mean portable like in portability across Operative Systems. I mean portable like a portable app (the apps that could even run from a usb drive). I'd want to participate in pyweek, but I want to make something of the highest quality achievable, so I'll go with Kivy/KivEnt. It'll need some C dependencies for physics. From the link below I know I need compiled C libraries for it to be achieved: https://github.com/kivy/kivent/wiki/Getting-Started-3:-Adding-the-Physics-System "Prerequisites: You will need to have compiled **kivent_core**, **kivent_cymunk**, and **cymunk**, in addition to having **kivy** and all its requirements installed." I think all of these dependencies would make most of people unable to play my game, so it'd be great to create an environment where such a game could run out of the box. I'm thinking something more like: * Download a ZIP file containing a folder with the environment. * Uncompress the ZIP file (now you have a folder where the game will run [don't care about system variables, that folder is all you need]). * Download a ZIP file containing a folder with the game files. * Unzip it so the game folder is inside the environment folder. * Run the game file. ____________________ An exe file for Windows would be great after the contest to share with non-technical friends. 
If you like hybrids of INI and JSON, have you looked at [TOML](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml)?
Google "Software protection dongle", you'll get tons of offers.
Can you share any evidence that either Microsoft or Google AI courses have ads? I'm pretty sure Google's is free as well and if you want the class feel then fast.ai isn't going to be free. So what the hell are you talking about?
Commenting because I can't figure out how to save a post on mobile. Awesome link op!
Not as deep as I would except.
Haha thanks. Unfortunately I haven't had much luck getting into any of the bigger software companies. 
I tend to prefer toml - Like INI but - well defined - Natively supports more complex hierarchies. - Meant for humans (comments, trailing commas ... I think) - Simple format to parse *Downsides* Doesn't support heterogeneous arrays. - Not that I want them to allow literal heterogeneous arrays but logical - e.g. In `Cargo`, a version string is short hand for a dependency object. So the literal types are different but logically they represent the same thing -`"1.0"` -&gt; `{ version = "1.0" }` - This can only be done with objects and not arrays Deep nesting gets weird. So sometimes I fall back to yaml instead.
It really is a great project: it's simple, clear as to what you want to do, and cool to have around. 
Can it compile CPython?
I use [TOML](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml), basically an improved and standardised .ini format. JSON is awkward to write by hand and while YAML is nice for larger very structured files, it feels awkward for a quick config file. TOML does need a 3rd-party module but how far are you going to get in a project without extra libraries anyway?
virtualenv seems to be made for having different python versions into the same server without interfering with existing installations, but it still depends on global environment variables. In my case, I simply downloaded the ZIP version of Python and removed environment variables so python can run into that folder. Now I'd need to add the rest of the dependencies while keeping the environment portable.
I like .RST, but its harder to use and beter suited for longer texts. For readme and such, markdown is perfectly acceptable.

You must realize that Google and Microsoft are profit driven corporations - right? Advertisement is implicit in the nature of their course offerings...
regardless, this is at the bottom: Q: Do I need an Azure subscription to complete the course? A: Yes. An Azure subscription is required to complete the hands-on labs in this course.
Don't worry, we won't share it. We'll use free software instead :)
 Perhaps something in this [direction](https://becominghuman.ai/building-an-image-classifier-using-deep-learning-in-python-totally-from-a-beginners-perspective-be8dbaf22dd8)?
Try putting your command in a list: change `cmdping = "netcat -l 4444"` to `cmdping = ["netcat", "-l", "4444"]`
He's probably just pointing it out as an example of why the courses are good, and not as a jab against google or microsoft. 
I did stumble about the oddity with stderr too. Do you have any idea why?
&gt; Thanks a million!!! 
Wow, this is really cool! I definitely see myself using this to decorate my flask view functions. This + the Flask Debug Toolbar will be so powerful for debugging my web apps. From playing around with it, Birdseye seems to remember old functions it decorated, is there a way to clear that history?
Thanks!
Sounds like you want a virtualenv for development with pyinstaller as your deployment means. You would have a standalone development environment that is easily recreateable and the ability to distribute a single binary that has everything built in statically.
I made a simple wrapper around the [devRant](https://devrant.com/) public API. I joined devRant community yesterday, it seems cool! You can find the project [here](https://github.com/SergioLaRosa/pydevrant)
Can JS be next please?
It's been 4-6 years since I read this acronym.
Hey, ShivyC + [PyVM](https://github.com/ForceBru/PyVM) may finally allow people to run C code anywhere Python can run!
An azure subscription is necessary for the labs
Common Lisp implementations usually have no lock on their runtime, except for the need to be careful with certain "program-modifying" operations (class hierarchy modifications, for example). Likewise, Gauche and Chez are two examples of natively-threaded Scheme implementations. And Chez, with an embedded native compiler AND thread support is probably as good an implementation as you could reasonably expect.

What's `\uEF0F` doing there? The :one: emoji is just `'1\u20E3'`, AKA `'\u0031\u20E3'`. You also (as I'm pretty sure is written plainly in the discord.py docs, and if not can be found under `?tag emoji` in the discord.py support server) can just write `add_reaction(message, 'one')` and it'll go through as `1\u20e3`.
I like Github!
Ah damn it! Oh well. 
I haven’t taken a deep dive yet, but I’m assuming the free tier in azure with the $200 credit should be goon enough isnt it?
Or you can get the same course on EDX where you can download the notebooks and run locally. 
I have always wondered why people are so needlessly hostile on the internet. I just don’t get it; it’s like he was personally insulted.
Just have to keep practicing and be consistent! Good luck!
I think arduino needs a shield (add-on board) to access the network, and you probably need to rewrite a lot of your code to get it to work.
I use YAML, with a somewhat relaxed format: https://github.com/ralienpp/reyaml The main benefit is that it uses indentation to express hierarchy, which is very pythonic, in my opinion. Second, it is less cluttered than formats like JSON, you don't have to keep track of matching braces, for example.
1. Applies to new entries only. 2. Some fields only have a few options (as defined by the feed protocol). for example, &lt;status&gt;&lt;/status&gt; can only be "actual", "draft", "exercise", "test", "system." But some fields should be user-definable. 3. New criteria should only apply to new entries only. So no retroactive filtering.
&gt; The underlying problem is that most people simply don't care to learn &gt;math or computer science or even foundational logic for that matter. What is your source of information on that? 
And it gives you experience with a wide range of topics: writing GUI/CLI tools, working with web APIs, and interfacing with the OS.
Plenty goon
I'm just saying that you can guess the underlying language by looking at the python code. If that works for you it's great. I would not even call that python though.

Sure, you _CAN_. You can also use a shovel to perform brain surgery. The question is, _SHOULD YOU?_
Or in Visual Basic, or in Assembly... Just because it's been done doesn't mean it's a good idea. The way to get something done is by utilizing the best (Where "best" means "highest probability of success for the least cost") technique.
Wow, this is definitely something I'm gonna a look into. Thanks OP!
1,) Weird, according to emojipedia, the \uEF0F is part of the combined emoji. What you posted works, however. I feel lied to. 2.) using the name does not work, for I get a "Unknown Unicode character" error (probably because I'm using the default python IDE). just pasting the emoji says "Unknown emoji." Thank you! although what does the "1" in '1\u20E3' mean, if you can explain briefly? Taking it out gives an unknown emoji error.
While you're trying `find`, also have a look at `fd`. It's much newer and offers much more intuitive options. It is also at least as fast as `find`

Not yet, unfortunately, but that's certainly a longer term goal.
Thanks! That sounds like a promising possibility.
How can I do it? Will it work if I install everything as normal and then do something to get it running from a flash drive in any other PC? What about that new embeddable python (libutils is a zip instead of a folder and no libs folder so maybe your virtualenv with pyinstaller is worth a try). Where do I start ? 
Something I always had in mind and never tackled (mostly due to the lack of the appropriate skills for the task) Keep it up!
Install python. pip install virtualenv Create project folder and cd into it. virtualenv projectname_env cd projectname_env\Scripts activate.bat You are now in your virtual environment. pip install pyinstaller pip install .....etc. Copy over other precompiled modules. Create your main script. Create pyinstaller spec file if necessary. pyinstaller --option1 --option2 mainscript.py Should give you a binary with everything bundled in that you can run on a Windows machine without installing python. All other info you can find online. I would go to the pyinstaller and virtualenv documentation pages and read. 
Alright, thanks :)
I could use a normal development environment. Will **pyinstaller** still still deploy a single binary that can run in any other PC? What about **Kivy/KivEnt** and the other **C or C++** dependencies ? Will it still work ?
lol
If anyone is interested or would like to comment further, I did ask this at stackoverflow as well.... https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49635600/distributing-python-packages-to-offline-machines The two basic answers are: 1 Use a CI to run a fleet of machines for each OS one needs to target to obtain the OS specific wheels * The issue here is just the shear amount of overhead this would require to setup and maintain. 2 pip download &lt;package_list&gt; --no-binary :all: -- the intention here is to grab the source distribution without any OS specific code included * While it works often, it is not reliable. For example, **pip download Sphinx --no-binary :all:** results in an error message on macOS running 10.13. ( https://gist.github.com/EricG-Personal/4d7cfe6fdb2cdda15ac48f41157a0f83 ) 
Azure is free for 30 days and even then, using a pay-as-you-go subscription, many of their services remain free for learning/testing purposes. The most you might be looking at, starting off, would be around $30 per month for certain types of services.
There's also an embeddable python version. Some useful links I've found so far are: https://github.com/kivy/kivy/wiki/Building-Portable-Package https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27488163/python-3-4-compile-cython-module-for-64-bit-windows 
Ok what now?
Sounds like a good option. binary is nice, but not mandatory. Docker is ok as long as it can have python, Kivy / KivEnt and the precompiled C / C++ stuff.
I have a feeling Pascal's triangle is going to come in here somewhere. And the Fibonacci sequence.

You can probably change alt+shift+e to whatever you want with this: https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/configuring-keyboard-and-mouse-shortcuts.html You get a lot of great feedback with python regarding code mistakes. I typically just run the code i'm playing with and see if it works. And when mistakes do arise, you can add breakpoints to inspect what's happening in your code: https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/part-1-debugging-python-code.html.html Well worth persevering with pycharm. :) 
Thanks, but don't you have to select the code with the mouse first and then run it? 
You know what, I think control + enter works with Jupyter notebooks (where you define chunks of code and can run them seperately). And given that you've come from R, betting this is what you are after: https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/using-ipython-notebook-with-product.html
Yes, I'm aware of that, which is what I'm trying to replicate in PyCharm. Jupyter notebooks are good for exploratory analysis, but doesn't seem good for writing full projects.
I'm not sure that shows me anything. It doesn't show supply vs. demand.
I wrote a port of scala's pureconfig that uses typesafe config format along with typing namedtuples to automatically parse the files declaratively. I'll hopefully be open sourcing that soon
Part of the problem with your plan is that you need to check the licensing on the components you are distributing. Some components, even if they are free, will require that you don't distribute them packaged into your program, or will require more complications during download when users must be shown the license and accept it. If you want to create an exe for windows, `setuptools` have a command called `bdist_wininst`. See here for more info: https://docs.python.org/3.6/distutils/builtdist.html#creating-windows-installers but then there will be the problems (or maybe not) with the C extensions (I never used those specific extensions, so I cannot tell).
Well now, here's the thing: we always had the distinction between work that needs hard real time and work that doesn't. With IoT and the hobbyist world of things like PyComs, I am pretty happy for people to be able to use python instead of say, Arduino C. 
I know, right? With political posts and such I can see where it's coming from, but this guy said nothing even remotely controversial. I guess some people just really like to argue. 
You may have better luck with /r/learnpython 
&gt; Just thought it was an interesting perspective about a place that you only hear about through the lens of western media. Huh?
I found Python was not that suitable for GPGPU, when you need low-level control about when things get copied back and forth between CPU and GPU.
If you have the source code of the library available then you can wrap around it from python.

Picked up Python recently and I've made a linux terminal based labirynth generator/solver. Obviously pretty simple, but feels good. It's called Ariadne! 
You can get one from Heroku for free.
The course is well designed and concepts are well explained. Ardit also tells us when and where we would get an error and also explains how to solve those errors. His teaching pace was great not too fast and not too slow. The best thing about this course was he covered web app, desktop app and also deploying apps to cloud which with use of heroku makes it absolute breeze. At the end I was able to build the applications quite easily as all the things were already known to me. My suggestion would be to start teaching Machine Learning in Python as AI is currently at it's best.
It might be more worth the money to pay a bit to train it on Amazon. I've also been there, trying to train on a CPU, it's the worst. #nevergoback
It would still be possible to tamper with if the calling part is in the python code
True, but if you want a good project and to try out some micropython then this would be a great route, but I would recommend starting with something a bit easier as well :)
Nice! My sister did the same with a little flask app hosted on https://www.pythonanywhere.com

You could try your manual method, but the operating system task scheduler will be more reliable. I highly suggest you try the task scheduler again and work out any kinks.

Is there a way to make it so that it's listed in order by date? So it'd be the first date with all of the tickers that are present on that day, followed by the next date etc.?
Yup! Edited my comment to include a call to 'sort_index'
roflastc
Thank you so much!
How can I convert it? I tried to before and couldn't figure it out so I just left it as it is.
I created this for exactly that purpose : http://hitchdev.com/strictyaml It's basically YAML without the nasty surprising stuff and built in (but optional) schema validation. There's also documentation about why I think it should be used over most other config formats in the README (including TOML, INI, JSON, python files, etc.)
What kind of library do you use for web scraping?
if you use `pythonmode` in vim, you can do the same with &lt;cntr-c&gt;g. If you use the ropvim plugin, you can do a lot more https://github.com/python-rope/ropevim
Basically you overwrite the date column by assigning it the output of ``pd.to_datetime(column_name)``. Note that we have to use a lambda function to do this because of the method chaining, which doesn't have access to the new, concatenated columns unless you use a lambda. I've edited the code to show this.
JS?
Thanks for pointing it out.. Will look into it..
Hmm that doesn't seem to work...if I were to run the code without the sort_index (because right now that gives me an error), then looking at the Date index, it is still of type pandas.tslib.timestamp
Not sure, /u/alexmojaki?
So you can distuingish logs from normal print output. If logging was on the same stream as print output you would have to figure out which is which.

For fixed tasks like that task scheduler is probably your best bet. In my experience the pain is dealing with the fact that you have basically no environment vars defined including the path. And error output gets swallowed so hard to debug. Often you need to execute a cmd file that sets up vars and stuff like the virtualenv then calls your python script. 
It's a list of lists...
wow I feel like an idiot holy. Please ignore my stupidity.
You're only creating a shallow copy of the lists. The lists are the same lists. You should use the deepcopy function from the copy module in the stdlib. https://docs.python.org/3/library/copy.html?highlight=copy%20deepcopy#copy.deepcopy
I loved using ConfigObj at http://configobj.readthedocs.io/en/latest/[configobj docs] which supports nested values, validation and read/eriting. As the documentation says, it supports the following... an ini file round tripper. Its main feature is that it is very easy to use, with a straightforward programmer’s interface and a simple syntax for config files. It has lots of other features though : Nested sections (subsections), to any level List values Multiple line values String interpolation (substitution) Integrated with a powerful validation system including automatic type checking/conversion repeated sections and allowing default values When writing out config files, ConfigObj preserves all comments and the order of members and sections Many useful methods and options for working with configuration files (like the ‘reload’ method) Full Unicode support 
Let me know if you have any questions or want to hear of any struggles/successes I had with flask! 
Oh right, I could have done that as well. I just used list comprehension: kappa = [x[:] for x in rows] 
I'd probably stick with task scheduler. If you did want to go the "run at all times" route, I'd check out the third party [Schedule](https://github.com/dbader/schedule) module, though you could also just sleep the number of seconds between tasks by calculating it from `datetime.datetime.now()`. It just seems like a waste to keep a process in memory when it only does something twice a day.
I generally prefer [dotenv](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-dotenv). Servers these days are most easily configured with environment variables, so that's what I try to stick with. If I need something more complex, I like yaml.
Can you use containerized code in your disconnected machine? If so, install Docker or the like and distribute a self-contained environment that can be updated at-will with one file transfer.
&gt; Since this license library is in C and is always delivered to customers compiled, customers cannot tamper with it. That's... not really how computers work. You can disassemble compiled code and reverse engineer it, though obviously that's a giant pain in the ass. Still, it happens all the time. That's how these AAA games get cracked. &gt; I am looking for ways to implement something similar in python (which the app is a set of py files and can be easily read) that is also hard to tamper with. Does anyone have any ideas around this? I suppose this would be of common interest for apps that depend on licenses for execution in general. You could probably just use the C library with a thin wrapper if you want. [Tools like SWIG](http://www.swig.org/) exist. For Python, you can just distribute the .pyo files or convert them all to an executable package for various platforms. It's not unlike distributing Java jar files. [See this StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3344115/obfuscating-python-code) on how to byte-compile Python scripts without docstrings, some variable names, etc. Of course it can still be tampered with. And Python's byte code is a lot easier than assembly. That's just unavoidable.
What is it?
Correct. Which version of pandas are you running? I'll look more into this in the morning, I'm but familiar with ``pandas.tslib.timestamp``
Sorry the text is so small, I guess the screenshots didn't want to cooperate :/
There's a Flask debug toolbar? Damn, this is news to me.
Awesome! Thanks for sharing, I've been looking for something new to learn and this seems like it might just fit in with what I'm looking to accomplish longer term.
Working on a web application similar to r/place but with ASCII art and Vim-like controls. Back end is pretty much finished and tested (except for web socket related stuff because testing that is kind of hard), and after I get AWS CodeDeploy and Travis set up for automatic deployment, I can start working on the frontend.
It moved to the left for me. Very odd!
&gt; average_comments_per_photo = photo_count / float(total_comment_count)
Then I don't really understand why you think you need asynchronous computation. The human player can't make moves while the AI is deciding on a move.
I've ended up just going the django route and having my settings file be `settings.py`. I know what it's like to wish you could dynamically handle just one little aspect. Now whenever I run into those scenarios I get to just do whatever I want. and basic usage is just "import settings". I'm surprised you didn't end up going that route.
As a rough guideline, tuples will contain structured, possibly heterogeneous data - so each position will have a meaning (think of a set of coordinates as an example); while a list will have homogenous data, and the position in the list doesn't carry any meaning except perhaps that the overall order might.
Tuples are hashable and can be used as dictionary keys and elements in a set or frozenset. And IIRC they're slightly faster when running the program, too.
deepcopy is more scalable - it can figure out how far it needs to reverse instead of you hard coding it, and can be smart about reusing things that are guaranteed to be immutable.
The biggest difference, aside from mutability, is that lists are intended to homogeneous and order is might important. You wouldn't want a list with a user object, a string and an integer, there's not much you can do with that list. Of course, Python doesn't make this a requirement but other languages do. On the other hand, tuples don't have to be homogeneous and order is very important. A tuple of a user object, a string and an integer might be a representation of a user, a session id and how many seconds until the session expires. I find it helpful to try to replace tuples with namedtuples instead. If it's not something I could easily do then maybe a tuple is a bad fit. 
Did I math wrong or are you saying there's a better way to do that?
(facepalm) I need to go to bed, obviously

Hi there, from the /r/Python mods. We have removed this post as it is not suited to the /r/Python subreddit proper, however it should be very appropriate for our sister subreddit /r/LearnPython. We **highly encourage** you to re-submit your post over on there. The reason for the removal is that /r/Python is dedicated to discussion of Python news, projects, uses and debates. It is not designed to act as Q&amp;A or FAQ board. The regular community is not a fan of "how do I..." questions, so you will not get the best responses over here. On /r/LearnPython the community is actively expecting questions and are looking to help. You can expect far more understanding, encouraging and insightful responses over there. No matter what level of question you have, if you are looking for help with Python, you should get good answers. If you have a question to do with homework or an assignment of any kind, please make sure to read their sidebar rules **before** submitting your post. If you have any questions or doubts, feel free to reply or send a modmail to us with your concerns. Warm regards, and best of luck with your Pythoneering!
There is nothing inherently wrong with a global connection. I just have a preference to avoid non-constant globals in my code when I can. In most of the cases where I need multiprocessing, I already have functional single process code. Using the method detail in the post allows me to adapt it with minimal modification and no globals.
This seems wrong to me. `datetime.now().day` will return the date of the current day, not the day of week. You want `datetime.now().weekday()` (0-6 starting Monday) or `datetime.now().isoweekday()` (1-7 starting Monday)
You're right, thanks, don't know what I was thinking there.
`&gt; /dev/null` means sending any data from standard output to the null device, essentially a black hole for disposing of unwanted data.
Thanks for the pointers on that.
Config is a very general requirement and I wanted something that I could feel comfortable using in a wide variety of use-cases. One of the use cases I wanted to support was writing back to the config file. For example, a GUI might have a settings dialog that writes out to the config file. Another use case might be an program which users will want to share configs for. A script config would be a security risk in these cases. Finally, there's just the temptation to add code to your config. Not sure I'd be able to resist.
That’s why screenshots of code are usually not accepted. Plus, not being able to copy/paste your code and run it.
Also, why are you casting total_comment_count to a float? Providing you are not deceiving me with your variable names, it should be cast to an int.

Your setter recurses forever because the attribute you are setting happens to be going through the property setter (it has the same name, `state`). To prevent that, you would usually use a private attribute that backs the property value, something like `_state`. It is also preferable to assign a default value to this attribute in the constructor. ``` class BaseDevice(object): def __init__(self, name): self.name = name self._state = None @property def state(self): return self._state @state.setter def state(self, state): self._state = state ```
I don’t feel the need to learn C though. I have no purpose for it :( What made learning C so much easier for python? I wonder if java would do the same? Though learning two languages seems pretty steep
that's going to be difficult since there is no such thing as AI 
Gods I can't believe I did that. . . I actually have a memory of typing out "JavaScript".
It's probably to ensure floating point division rather than integer division, although it's not necessary in python 3.x: bash:~# python Python 2.7.6 (default, Nov 23 2017, 15:49:48) [GCC 4.8.4] on linux2 &gt;&gt;&gt; 7/3 2 &gt;&gt;&gt; python3 Python 3.4.3 (default, Nov 28 2017, 16:41:13) &gt;&gt;&gt; 7/3 2.3333333333333335

Here's a good article which lists a bunch of options on distributing Python programs: https://hackerboss.com/how-to-distribute-commercial-python-applications/ &gt; What kind of licence can't be distributed as a package ? It will ultimately depend on how you distribute your package. If your package bears a proprietary license, for example, you cannot use GPL-licensed code with it, because GPL requires that the code using the GPL-licensed code have a compatible, free license (unlike, say, GPL2). Here's simplified discussion of this topic: https://opensource.stackexchange.com/questions/1459/proprietary-software-using-gpl-modules 
In what way are they faster? When dealing with lots of smaller tuples vs lists or with one huge tuple vs list?
I mean the underlying C code in the Python interpreter: similar operations like slicing and searching may be faster if the underlying data structure is simpler, but it would depend on the implementation and I really don't know enough about the CPython interpreter to say for sure.
Exactly. This is the semantic difference. So if you have a function that returns an arbitrary number of Widgets, then return a list of Widgets. But if you return exactly one widget, and one wodget, then it makes sense to return a tuple, (widget, wodget)
Well, of course it’s competitive, bearing in mind the alternatives.
Could you represent your rules as a series of XPath queries that if true cause the action to be triggered?
yes yes why not
hy kpenchev93, how to edit my post
ok thanks for suggestion
nothing on flask celery? a post discussing a common usecase like scraping urls and storing the results into db through celery would be super appreciated
...maybe respond to OP instead of me?
All data is stored in a SQL database. By default this is a sqlite file `~/.birdseye.db`. Simply delete that file, then restart the server. If you want a more convenient way... https://github.com/alexmojaki/birdseye/issues/5
Umm. I might use sqlalchemy's expression language to programmatically build the query. That way you stay lightweight (no orm) while not having to hand code sql.
Since tuples are immutable they have a set memory allocation. Lists on the other hand need to grow or shrink as you add or remove items. Not sure about python list implemetation, but Java lists would double in size once the initial array length of a list would hit its cap. So you end up linearly adding elements until your list hits the memory cap, then the list doubles in size granting further space in the data structure. I believe this is referred to as amortized logarithmic running time because every so often the list needs to grow. I assume python lists are not too far in implemetation.
Yes indeed Python lists are like this. Tuples therefore faster and more memory efficient especially for many instances of short sequences.
Ok thanks for the suggestion, I'm still relatively new to python and this project is my first useful one 
Sad indeed.
Tuples are quite often used for tricks like: a, b, c = 1, 2, 3 or return a, b, c of for a, b, c in zip(l1, l2, l3): ... Those are quite useful.
It's great you have a project to learn with. I recommend that everytime you learn something new you add to it or re write your program with what you have learnt. My first project went from a tiny script to 4 docker services, database backend, scheduler and remote access logins using a rest server.... It still only did the basic function of the first script but everytime I just added something new, or a new little feature. Back to the oq, go for a raspberry or similar, install Linux and run your script from there :) and good luck...
All depends on the scalability requirements of the project. It’s easier to scale Golang vs Python, but it doesn’t really matter unless you have a tremendous amount of traffic. (I mean, Instagram, YouTube, and lots of Uber stuff uses Python at scale. So it’s possible, just not as straightforward.)
Did they actually benchmark anything before jumping to that conclusion? Go's networking libraries used to be very slow, I don't know if they improved. Python has many very mature libraries already, and I wouldn't sacrifice a whole well designed language for the clunky mess that's go. 
Ask in /r/learnpython but be advised they won't do your homework for you either.
all i need to do is 3d surface plot with 1024x1024 numpy array ...i ll look into it thanks
Mutability/immutability is enforced by the language. Homogeneity/heterogeneity not at all. First time I hear about this guideline. I am interested in references about that.

&gt; Lists are lists of the same kinds of thing you're thinking of an array. lists can mix types &gt;&gt;&gt; from array import array &gt;&gt;&gt; l = [1, 'a'] # no error &gt;&gt;&gt; a = array('b', l) Traceback (most recent call last): File "&lt;input&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt; a = array('b', l) TypeError: an integer is required (got type str) &gt; A list is a list of homogeneous stuff. For that reason, you can append to it or sort it. lists can be altered because they are defined that way. their mutability has nothing to do with their contents &gt; A tuple is a tiny anonymous class. i dont want to get into the semantics of data types vs. classes in a language like python, but regardless, it's not anonymous at all. it's a tuple &gt;&gt;&gt; a = 1, &gt;&gt;&gt; a.__class__ &lt;class 'tuple'&gt; 
It's good to default to immutability unless you need something to be mutable. You know that immutable structures won't change from under you. Mutability usually comes with more overhead too.
Thing is, while AI is deciding my game window gets stuck with a horrible looking loader.
It's not enforced, but it's a convention and how they're usually used. If the position in a list had meaning, it wouldn't make sense after slicing or inserting elements. A fixed size means the number of items is fixed, so you can logically specify the purpose of each position. As for references, the description in the language reference [mentions](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#tuple) the convention.
&gt; You wouldn't want a list with a user object, a string and an integer, there's not much you can do with that list While I generally agree with what you wrote I do think that the above statement is just too strict. Such a list would be used in situations such as dumps and logs, passing through **kwargs, etc.
Generally, lists are great for holding multiple objects, while tuples are better to be used for holding multiple attributes of one object that won't change, e.g. representing a color using RGB values.
Tuples are only hashable if all of their contents are hashable. 
`def f(**kwargs)` is a dictionary so it really doesn't apply here, and `def f(*args)` would build a tuple. Maybe I'm misunderstanding you. 
 &gt;&gt;&gt; l=[1,2,3] &gt;&gt;&gt; a,b,c=l &gt;&gt;&gt; print(a,b,c) 1 2 3
Good bot
If you were trying to make some kind of argument, you should know that your second example doesn't involve lists or tuples, and 6our third example is a tuple. 
Tuples are faster when they're constant, since lists need to be created in runtime. example: In [2]: dis.dis(lambda: (1,2,3)) 1 0 LOAD_CONST 4 ((1, 2, 3)) 2 RETURN_VALUE In [3]: dis.dis(lambda: [1,2,3]) 1 0 LOAD_CONST 1 (1) 2 LOAD_CONST 2 (2) 4 LOAD_CONST 3 (3) 6 BUILD_LIST 3 8 RETURN_VALUE 
And they’re hashable (when their contents are hashable, as /u/kurashu89 points out) *because* they’re immutable.
Joe Spolsky has a quote about you need to pick a cool language in order to make people work for you. I think golang might be slightly more exciting than python (particularly if you already know a bunch of python). Nice things about golang: * No gil, so no need for multiprocessing, so less pain (kind of irrelevant if you are using a database for your state / synchronisation since you can easily load balance) * Potentially type safety becomes useful at scale but this seems irrelevant for this application (crud tends to have simple functions) My gut feeling would be that if you are touching a database or doing IPC on each call this is going to take up most of the time so it's a toss up. An exception would be if you want in process state, or if you are doing a bunch of maths. I would probably go with python for this sort of thing, but you might have some secret requirements. I haven't thought of.

Your coworkers are right and the name of the bloody language is "Go".
Cause your friends don't RST and if they don't RST...
Any (finite) iterable can be used for your first two cases, lists included. A zip-like function that returned lists instead of tuples for some reason would also be a drop in replacement.
&gt; Any (finite) iterable can be used for your first two cases, lists included. In the first case they all will be converted to tuples and in second you can of course do: return [a, b, c] and that will work, but by default it is tuple. 
I am unfortunately dependent on win32com interfaces which I don’t think will play well within a docker container. Correct me if I’m wrong. Due to this, rules out airflow.
`a, b, c = [1, 2, 3]` does *not* involve anything being converted to a tuple, although interesting enough, it does do the unpacking using slightly different bytecode: &gt;&gt;&gt; dis('a, b, c = [1, 2, 3]') 1 0 LOAD_CONST 0 (1) 2 LOAD_CONST 1 (2) 4 LOAD_CONST 2 (3) 6 ROT_THREE 8 ROT_TWO 10 STORE_NAME 0 (a) 12 STORE_NAME 1 (b) 14 STORE_NAME 2 (c) 16 LOAD_CONST 3 (None) 18 RETURN_VALUE &gt;&gt;&gt; dis('a, b, c = 1, 2, 3') 1 0 LOAD_CONST 4 ((1, 2, 3)) 2 UNPACK_SEQUENCE 3 4 STORE_NAME 0 (a) 6 STORE_NAME 1 (b) 8 STORE_NAME 2 (c) 10 LOAD_CONST 3 (None) 12 RETURN_VALUE 
&gt;Go's networking libraries used to be very slow, I don't know if they improved. Wasn't go practically designed specifically for web backends? If so, they'd probably work on the performance of those libraries quite a lot...
&gt;Nice things about golang It can be compiled down to a binary, too, can't it? Not having to deal with python packaging hassle if you're intending to deploy in other places or with other people that can be a godsend.
IMHO it's because Ruby is mostly limited to Rails. Python, OTOH, is frequently used for machine learning (though perhaps not as much as R). If you get rid of Rails and Machine Learning, it's not clear to me that more is built in Python. (I say that despite not liking what I've seen in Ruby's syntax...though nothing is as horrific as Javascript.)
Go is a great language, worthy of your time. It's a great language to know alongside Python. Why the negativity? I feel like you made this post, especially here, to get some sympathetic feelings towards having to use something other than python. If you want to be fair about it, why not cross post this to /r/golang too, see how that goes. You had it in your mind how this post would go putting it on /r/python.
The language reference says namedtuples are preferable over tuples for some heterogeneous data, but not tuples over lists. &gt; For heterogeneous collections of data where access by name is clearer than access by index, collections.namedtuple() may be a more appropriate choice than a simple tuple object.
If you're having issues with python installations: firstly (just to check) are you using virtualenvs/conda environments? That'll help if you're not. I also use pyenv and it's really helpful for managing multiple versions of python. With a bit of fiddling it can be used as a single interface for both conda and virtualenvs. Conda will probably be the most reliable way of installing it (besides docker) but that's about all I can say without knowing what kinds of issues you've been facing.
I haven't tested it on windows, but I don't see why it shouldn't work. These stack overflow discussions seem to indicate it would be an option. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32378494/how-to-run-airflow-on-windows You might want to write a custom operator to call commands from the windows shell too, but thats one of the nice things about Airflow.

I'm sorry you're very sad. However, you should think about what it is you're sad about and think about whether that's a good thing. Programming languages are like tools. Sometimes we get really good at using a tool. It's comfortable, we know how it reacts when we do stuff, and we get a lot done with it. However, sometimes, somebody has a task that just requires another tool. Are you sad that you have to learn another tool? Why? Why wouldn't you be excited to learn how to use that new tool? To get to understand how it works and feels. God, maybe you'll even like it better than the last one? In my lifetime, I've learned: * BASIC * FORTRAN * Pascal * C * C++ * FORTH * JCL * SAS * VisualBasic * Delphi (really Pascal again) * dBase III/Clipper * PHP * Python * Perl * Shell Scripting * Java * Javascript * Go * a bunch of other languages that don't exist any longer. :) I think you need to let go of your identity as a "python programmer" and realize you're a code jockey, and you can sling that code in whatever language is required. :) Best of luck to you. I bet you'll really enjoy Go.
`namedtuple` was added in 2.6 - probably because this old convention was lacking explicitness.
I haven't used to, but it doesn't seem like a terrible choice. As much as we all appreciate python in here, exposure to new languages is good for our growth, too. I have the notion that next time I feel like it's time to try out something different on a personal project, I will probably try go. It sounds like you will be getting paid to learn and use something new. Try and be positive and take full advantage of the opportunity, is my advice.
&gt; It can be compiled down to a binary Good point! And a [static binary at that](https://golang.org/doc/faq#Why_is_my_trivial_program_such_a_large_binary) 
Show them the ApiStar benchmarks. Perfectly possible to write very performant API services in Python. Having written APIs in both languages. While the Golang option may be faster, it adds a lot of development overhead. Particularly if you want to implement more sophisticated stiff such as rate limiting etc. I also think Golang is rather week on third party support. 
Isn't that scheme: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuation#Examples Ho ho ho.
From our very unscientific numbers, Django vs go, with similar-ish logic, go shaves around 5-10ms per request for simple-ish CRUD with 2-3 DB calls per request. You should test it out for yourself before accepting anything on the internet though.
That's an answer! Thank you.
# General Uses of Tuples Tuples are most useful when you are indexing something complicated (usually in a dictionary) or you want to do a few other things they're really good at. You might start out reading [here](http://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/python/english3e/tuples.html). # Tuples as Keys That page does not, however, cover use of tuples as keys in dictionaries (which is where they are probably most critical). Let's consider that you might want to write a program that remembers how many times you make a connection to some web site. How would you want to keep track of those connections? One way is to have a dictionary with keys that correspond to the host + port and values that are integers remembering how many connections were made. You might build a connection tracker class like this: from collections import defaultdict class ConnectionTracker(object): def __init__(self): self.connections = defaultdict(lambda: 0) def count(self, host, port): self.connections[ [host, port] ] += 1 def get_counts(self): return dict(self.connections) This wouldn't work. As soon as you tried to increment the connection count, you would get an error like: TypeError: unhashable type: 'list' This brings up the surprisingly sticky question of "what does it mean to be the key in a dictionary"? Theoretically, a key should sort of "identify" the value that we're looking up. In our case, the key of a host + port identifies an integer that is the count of connections. The problem is that a real dictionary needs to turn that key into something that it can use internally. To do this, Python has the notion of a "hash" of a value. The idea is that rather than having to work with arbitrarily complex and deep values, it sometimes makes sense to boil that value down to a single number that can be generated from a value. A hash doesn't have to be unique in general, but it should have a very low chance of having a "collision", where two values might have the same hash. You can read more [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17585730/what-does-hash-do-in-python). Internally, many data structures in Python use these hashes. Dictionaries and sets are two very good examples. There's no such thing as a free lunch. Any data structure has certain costs in terms of compute, memory, and ease-of-use for a particular purpose. In order for these hashes to make any sense, they can't *change*. This is why the above list fails to be hashable. Imagine if you filed something away by its hash and then it magically changed behind the scenes so it was suddenly in the wrong box? Tuples generally solve this problem (though they can reference mutable objects, which you really shouldn't do if you want them to be useful). They provide a sequence that can have a stable hash because it's not going to change. While you could make your own class for this (which itself would have to implement a `__hash__` function), it would be a lot of work when tuples fit that need neatly. A correct version of the above code uses a tuple. Here is the updated code, with a bit of magic to actually show it working: from collections import defaultdict class ConnectionTracker(object): def __init__(self): self.connections = defaultdict(lambda: 0) def count(self, host, port): self.connections[ (host, port) ] += 1 def get_counts(self): return dict(self.connections) if __name__ == '__main__': from pprint import pprint tracker = ConnectionTracker() tracker.count('127.0.0.1', 53) tracker.count('127.0.0.1', 80) tracker.count('127.0.0.1', 443) tracker.count('127.0.0.1', 443) tracker.count('127.0.0.1', 443) pprint(tracker.get_counts()) So, without tuples, you don't get hashes, and without hashes, things like dictionaries and sets don't really work. # Tuples to Structure Data Sometimes you might use a class to represent some pretty simple piece of data... then you instantiate 20 million of them and your process runs out of memory. Tuples (or their more evolved descendants [`collections.namedtuple`](https://docs.python.org/3.3/library/collections.html#collections.namedtuple)) allow you to easily represent this without hitting memory so hard. Consider [this page](https://stackoverflow.com/a/45123561) which indicates that a namedtuples (or classes with slots, which are a lot like tuples) can result in over a 2 times improvement in memory usage. For an example of this in the standard library, check out [`os.stat`](https://docs.python.org/2/library/os.html#os.stat) and [`urllib.parse.urlparse`](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/urllib.parse.html#urllib.parse.urlparse). Another data structure that lends itself to tuples are graphs. Edges consist of a list start and finish which is easily represented as a 2-tuple. When doing things like combining graphs, it's helpful to use sets (or dictionaries) of edges (because the sets can be trivially merged without worrying about duplicates). This is another situation where the set uses the hash value that you get out of a tuple that a list couldn't handle. # Performance in General That said, lists and tuples also have very different performance characteristics. As mentioned above, tuples are *very* friendly to memory. Tuples also don't fragment memory when you generate a ton of them. You can read some about that [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14135542/how-is-tuple-implemented-in-cpython). Lists, on the other hand, are highly optimized for mutation. Inserts are generally pretty efficient. A number of other operations that you might not have thought of are pretty managable, too. For a deeper comparison of different data structures efficiency, consider [this page](https://wiki.python.org/moin/TimeComplexity). You also get some pretty sweet things like [TimSort](https://svn.python.org/projects/python/trunk/Objects/listsort.txt). # Summary In general, there's no such thing as a free lunch. Programming is about trade-offs. Tuples hit a few sweet spots. Lists get you highly mutable sequences with a lot of utility. Tuples get you immutable sequences that are suitable for use as keys and similar things that represent structured data.
It doesn't always work and it can be very hacky (lots of configuration, manually specifying paths,…). In some languages one can create a binary of even a web app, with a production web server. I can't do that with my django app :/
Sure. I can add something like this. What would you like to see on the client-side? Would the end user submit URLs that s/he would like to have scraped? Or is it like an admin portal for scheduling jobs?
Don't forget edx and Coursera and others
I don't think it matters 
Interesting. I've never seen a free online course for learning Python.
even if it is something far simpler like pinging an API x number of times subject to rate limits to save its data to the database, it would be super appreciated, i guess it would be a bit easier on your side as well instead of using beautiful soup or any such library
The prospect of learning Go would be exciting to me. It's gaining a lot of traction, so would be good to have don't experience under your belt.
&gt;Rest API Backend (most is CRUD things). Which is sad because no matter what you choose your bottleneck is likely going to be DB access and IO speeds. If all operations are basic CRUD the language you use has almost no performance impact, or at least nothing large enough to matter. The best way to determine if there will be a language bottle neck is to find the most complex/difficult/process intensive request you would server and write up a solution to it in a couple different languages. Measure the performance and determine for yourself if the difference between languages is enough to justify one language over the other. Though I'll be honest, it seems like your team just wants to use Go. If that's what the majority of your team is comfortable using that then you should probably just get on board. Go really isn't that bad to work with. But I know the feeling... after spending so much time using Python it's painful to use something different. Like trying to eat soup with a fork. Yeah, this other language works... but damnit, a spoon (Python) would be so much easier.
The browser plugin is not in python is it? Also would you mind sharing it?
Looks like your date column is already in a datetime/timestamp format, so you should be good to go. I'd just take out the ``assign()`` call.

I saw that post, but once I dug into it more a few weeks ago but it appears that AF still doesn't work on windows due to some dependency issues. So as if Oct 2017 (which afaik nothing has changed since then) AF doesn't really support windows. Portions of it might work, but I really don't want to be fighting with the tool when I'm trying to get something done. https://stackoverflow.com/a/34372173/3314194 https://stackoverflow.com/a/46962458/3314194
I was guessing someone would hit some errors I might have missed 😂 I probably could have spent some more time looking through edge cases. The thing that surprised me most was that they were saved all video attempts you had recorded but then deleted. It was quite interesting to rewatch all of those, to say the least.
It's sad that in many companies you need to find an excuse to do that instead of being encouraged and given time for it.
Some documentation to indicate why this package is useful (what does it do?) might be a good idea. Is this just an alternative to distutils?
Go is pretty interesting, but I prefer using asyncio with aiohttp and aiohttp-swagger to build and document my APIs. The dev process is so fast and simple, and it performs better than Flask! 
How do you feel about the lack of generics in Go? I have only looked a little at Go and I am not sure how much of an impact that is.
I did the Taft Test on this page and it changed one icon: the subreddit icon. Well done, Reddit! 
He's sad for one of two reasons, neither of which are "I'm scared to learn a different language" Reason 1: Python really is too slow to do such a simple thing as serve as a RESTful backend to a web site. If that's the case: he's right: that's pretty sad! Reason 2: Python is plenty fast and his team is making a bad decision based on misinformation. This, also, is cause to be sad! 
Tuples of lists are not hashable, but tuples of classes are.
Yeah! absolutely. Thank you for your comment.
Noted, thanks for the heads up. It was more or less just a gag for the Navy Seal copypasta. But yes, I'll keep that in mind for future posts. Thanks!
Not actually. He is one of the best udemy instructor of Java I think. You can find some of his courses are free. If you ask him for any help or udemy coupon, he will always give a response. That's why I like him. Anyway thank you for your comment.
Two comments: 1) Python is clearly slower than it has to be Python can be *much* faster, look at ex. PyPy, but it seams to me that the Python core team is quite indifferent to this. 2) REST is *slow*, Go will not change that You convert some internal byte state to text, make it into a dictionary and send it via a slow network. (Unless you do some very complex processing before creating JSON) 
Sounds less like a Celery/async task post and more like a web scraping post. 
rather new to python. To learn threading and precompiling trying to make a mandelbrot fractal viewer
&gt; Go is an enjoyable, powerful, language, worthy of your time. Go is an abomination with enough bad design decisions to completely overshadow the few good ideas it entails.
I used to love Coursera. But their free courses are now incomplete. Last I checked, free courses no longer include exams, assignments, grades or certificates. All you get to do is audit the course, but not really participate. Kind of cripples the value that it used to have.
It constrains you to using Go's built-in datatypes, which may or may not affect you. It's a blocker if you want to use immutable data types or a niche optimized data structure, or anything else that's not built in. On the other hand it simplifies the language greatly if you're ok with being limited to slices, maps, and structs.
no i am taking the one from MIT's website(OCW), also reading the book along with it. loving it. my opinion on the matter is that edx is pretty awesome if you are short on time and want to learn 80 % of the stuff fast.But the environment of the classes makes me feel like i'm absorbing more.i know the reasoning is kinda vague but oh well :D
Print the value of your 'this' variable after the split and if it is always &gt;20 that is probably why. This type of question would be better received at /r/learnpython so you may want to post it there if this does not answer your question.
Thank you for your comment!!
You can do OOP with go but it doesn't lock you in. Functional as well, golang functions are first class after all. It just doesn't enforce either programming style. 
Hi! This module helps me write c++ extensions without explicitly compiling them before each run. It also generates boilerplate code I don't want to write. Here is a short example where cfly is a quick solution for a time consuming problem: https://github.com/pymet/pocket-cube-experiment I have tried to implement a numpy equivalent solution, but it got a lot slower since numpy arrays are not hashable. --- cfly is using distutils under the hood. It compiles the source as it was a normal python extension.
You can try edx courses. edx courses are always great!
Actually I never thought about edx, Coursera etc. I was trying to find as many as I could.
Oh that was a good read. Thanks! 
The classification of languages is a bit odd IMO. The classification is multi dimensional so it's hard to just clump based on one dimension. Also, .net is not a language. PS Redis is more a NoSQL database than a cache. 
No error from my part. Just joking since I'm not on Facebook :p
Look at the license for the packages and meet their requirements. I bet most don't require anything.
Mutable/Immutable is the whole enchilada. You pass a list to a function and it can f*ck with it and you may never know. Can give rise to hard to notice bugs.
If that's all it takes it seems like almost every language is 'multi-paradigm' then?
That's not what a functional language is about.
So, I took your suggestion. Below is what I have https://github.com/tommytwotoes/Weather I made it email to text alert on daily weather. If people generate an API key, then they can hard-set that. Thus, allowing this to work as a cron-job
Yeah, I have gone through his youtube series on Java and right now I am going through the C++ youtube series. He is the best online teacher for me I found so far.
that’s awesome!!! Good job. 
I don't know if I'd consider any of the auth recommendations exotic. Maybe openid but that's just because I don't see it that often anymore
I have removed this post as it is aimed at beginners 
Yeah, absolutely. I forgot.
I actually indeed do it like that, without having read about it or having thought about it. Interesting.
Great read. I'm definitely guilty of over-complicating things.
Interesting article!
Source code or not I would just add the license requirement just to be on the safe side. You could try contacting the developers to get clarification but I don't see the harm in just adding the credit, copyright, and license documents with your software so there is't any misunderstanding.
Oh nice, I forgot there was "in" statement in SQL too. I should read more about that. Thanks!
&gt; Go will not change that You convert some internal byte state to text, make it into a dictionary and send it via a slow network. Some pedantic muttering (highly speculative - I haven't timed any of this recently): * I think loopback network traffic on the same machine is actually comparable to other types of IPC (not memory-maps) * I think the performance hit is might be more related to the IPC operation rather than the encoding / decoding time. My experience is that things like `sqlite` mop the floor with things like `redis` as far as performance goes for this reason.
Out of curiosity, is this project perhaps inspired by Rust's Cargo?
The Taft test is fun. So many sites are so much better with Taft!
LOL PHP in 2018
Anyone? 
That's unfortunate. I teach the use of required keyword arguments I teach in my intermediate Python classes because long-time casual Python users (the majority of Python users) often don't know know about that syntax. Any suggestions on where this article might be appropriate to post on Reddit, if not /r/Python? The /r/learnpython sub-Reddit seems to only accept text posts.
Hey I was working on this exact same situation just recently. Instead of doing repeated joins, I opted to instead use intersect on several exists queries. I'm not sure if it's 100% optimal but it felt more logical to me than the joins. SELECT * FROM Items WHERE EXISTS ( SELECT 1 FROM Tags WHERE Tags.item_id == Items.id AND Tags.tag == "horse" ) INTERSECT SELECT * FROM Items WHERE NOT EXISTS ( SELECT 1 FROM Tags WHERE Tags.item_id == Items.id AND Tags.tag == "jessica" ) Actually now that I read it back again, I wonder if the intersects are unnecessary and it could just be `WHERE EXISTS (...) AND NOT EXISTS (...)`. I'm going to keep looking into this.
Thabks, that's a nice insight. I shall look into this too.

Thanks! The streams way definitely looks simpler than subclassing Protocol.
Saved for later reading
&gt; Consider returning 3 values from a function call Those 3 values are actually one tuple anyway: return a, b, c That returns a tuple constructed by [separating items with commas](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#tuple). 
Tuples need at least one comma, e.g.: I don't think, it matters
Yeah so if anything a list seems better
Money and job security are not hard to come by in this industry, and you don't need to settle for a mediocre primary language to get them.
Great article! I think Pipenv is the new recommendation for package management in Python though. 
You can learn Python with almost any project. The better question is, "do you want to use the Raspberry Pi for any projects"? If you have no interest in the Raspberry Pi itself, you might be better off choosing another starter project.
This looks really interesting I will give it a try tomorrow. What would you say is the benefit of this over something like pipenv? What did you find was missing? 
Are lanugages like Go, Rust, Elixir and Clojure even employable skills? Is it worth to learn them? All the jobs offers I see in my region are mostly C# and Java
This question would be better asked in /r/learnpython
Not a „data pipeline“ per se but you could use jenkins to trigger jobs, manage dependent execution etc.
Maybe the plotly community forum could help you with this..?! Not too many dash users here yet.,
Because Go doesn't have generic functions and its builtin types are invariant (AFAIK), it also precludes expressing abstract operations on builtin types.
Thanks, that is a reasonable thought! I have used it for typical CI things, but that’s an interesting thought.
Ok, so whats your question?
I need help
You can take a look at a few reasons why I do not like pipenv here: https://github.com/sdispater/poetry#what-about-pipenv But, basically, pipenv has a poor dependency resolver, makes some strange decisions (like setting wildcard requirements which can cause issues), has a CLI that I don't find intuitive (but this is a matter of preferences) and, more importantly, it only tries to solve one thing (dependency resolution) while leaving the rest (like packaging) which means you will still need to figure out the rest yourself. I wanted a tool to manage Python projects from start to finish (intitial development with dependency resolution all the way to packaging and publishing). So, that's why I started poetry.

Well you were talking about having to read a database and start converting files from disk to another format and store stuff in database. That looks parallelizable to me. Spark is not just map/reduce, it has much more useful stuff that allows you to create pipelines like the one you mention (unless I didn't understand it completely..). You can exploit spark framework to define pipelines in spark that are just a list of funtion calls one after the other. (pipelines in the file related to spark, and actual code in other files) Related to your own question of Kafka, there is also Spark streaming! But never tried it so not sure how good it is. If windows is mandatory, then the only other solution that I see is writting that ugly python script which will be the "data pipeline manager".

I was going to give that a try too. Thanks!
'a bunch of other languages that don't exist any longer. :)' and Forth still exists? LOL. I miss Delphi to this day. 
That's impressive. Let's say 25 languages allowing for "a bunch of other languages that don't exist any longer", five years to learn each language and that's 125 years. Where did you get the time to breath?
Would you be open to adding a scripts feature to add custom commands to poetry? For example, in package.json you can declare a `scripts` section and define your own commands such as `build` or `lint` etc. If you'd open to the idea, I'd be willing to help with the implementation.
Sorry, python isn't cool any more. It really sucks because python + C or C++ extensions can drive a lot of performance and interact with a lot of existing code. Go is painful when you know how handy python is. To say that the performance of python won't match go's in a basic CRUD app is preposterous. If it were me, I'd prototype a simple solution before there's is off the ground. nginx + uwsgi + falcon will be blazing fast and perform as-good if not better than a naive Go implementation.
Simply create a new conda environment for Python 3.6 with this command conda create -n py36 python=3.6 then install in that en all packages you plan to use.
I work a lot with ansible. I prefer YAML over JSON. In fact, JSON is a subset of YAML, so the same parser can use JSON or YAML. YAML is a nice medium between INI and JSON. You get to have nested values and interesting data types (dictionaries and lists), and don't need all the ugly braces of JSON.
I prefer [cppimport](https://github.com/tbenthompson/cppimport) for prototyping things and doing quick tests.
Thanks for the advice - I am now doing this. Does this mean I should reinstall all of my packages (numpy, scipy, scikit-learn, matplotlib etc) within this new environment? And are there any additional steps for configuring this environment?
Go and Elixir are used a little. You'll get to use some Clojure if you work in a Java environment.
Username...doesn't check out ;) I like Go, I'm always curious to hear what's faulty, could you elaborate on the main issues you have with Go? 
Pennies are still classified as money.
I would use a different kind of structure, either a named tuple or a class you define, if you need to return multiple values from a function. If you have a tuple with more than two or three items that's being passed around you're going to have a bad time maintaining your code. Source: I've done this before and regret it.
I feel like you're trying to solve the wrong problem.

Not sure quite exactly what you're asking. Have you looked at Luigi or Apache Airflow? If I understood you somewhat, you could use either of these using pytest or unit testing and apply assert statements to test the values that you expect.
As a data engineer at Enigma, I’ve tried a couple different things for the ETL pipelines that I’ve worked on. Each of the items below is a python package. - goodtables is a python library that generates “data quality” reports give a path to a file and a list of constraints that the files should satisfy. It is part of the Frictionless data ecosystem, which has a data quality dashboard on GitHub that is powered by goodtables. - engarde is a convenient library to halt your pipeline the moment some data fails a rule, assuming you are using pandas dataframes in your ETL - Great Expectations is a new project that has a different syntax for performing very similar checks to what the previous two reports supply, but also has a nice way to display the error reports. All of these choices are active as of the past few months on GitHub, hopefully one (or a combination of them) will suit your needs :)

Yes if you go into the properties of the python executable you should be able to change the icon to a .ico file (you can find converters online for .png to .ico, it's essentially just resizing it)
&gt; Also, .net is not a language. Neither is Node.js. And "Golang" is called Go. "Golang" is a term people started using either because they can't separate in their heads the name of a language from its domain name, or because a search company gave their language an unsearchable name. Or both.
There's no premium for writing PHP. PHP developers are two-a-penny.
&gt; As an aside: how is Golang a 'multiparadigm' language? It looks from the outside like a straight imperative C-like without support for OOP, FP, or really any other paradigm. For what it's worth, it is "action-oriented" OO, and uses composition not inheritance. Functions are first class and can return functions. It also supports doing this in true fan out/in across as many cores as your processor has, all of which make it quite different. I think if they said "type-safe C/CPP alternatives", it would have made more sense than "multiparadigm", which is a meaningless term.
These step-by-step roadmaps are essentially useless. There's no one path; everyone finds their own path, and it's usually guided by the needs of whatever they're working on. Articles like this always come across as little more than the author saying, "Look at all the things I've heard of!"

Unfortunately I can’t just not do work :-/. The software we are interfacing only runs on windows. There is currently no other way to access the data.

Spark would be able to provide some parallelism in the fact thst zoe could run multiple instances of the code that does the conversion, but last that I’m not quite sure what else it would be able to do. I can’t break the files apart (binary) and the inserting capabilities of spark into a database is limited to just appending to a single table. I can get the same functionality by just calling the code twice. Which is why i’m hesitant on adding Spark and incurring the overhead and operation headache of it.

Hey dude I just want you to know that your comment is what drove the last 5 months of my work on this project. I've been working on creating an object detection neural network that identifies playing cards. You're right, implementing the network itself was trivial. However, figuring out how to 1) get the TensorFlow tools needed to train my own object detection RCNN network on my Windows PC, 2) train a network on labeled images of cards, 3) use my trained network, and 4) get the network to run on the Raspberry Pi has been anything but trivial. But it finally frickin works now! Thanks for getting me started down this long road of learning about machine learning. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rgpfk6eYxJA (Video on how to run TensorFlow on the Raspberry Pi coming soon)
Here is some advice... try to figure out the number of possible input choices that users can make from your 7 binary questions. If you match each class to an exact set of answers, how often will your user get an actual suggestion? 
Sure. They are called shortcodes and go for several thousand dollars to provision. Then between 3-5k a month. 
TLDR: Used Python to catch my ex cheating. Long story: I created a Teamspeak viewer that would replicate itself for every ip and port it could connect to. It would then scan the servers every 5 minutes and update the channel and user view accordingly. I think I had about 3 thousand servers monitored at this point and used 7 of the 10 racks on my tower. I realized I could then use the unique ID of users to see what other servers they were on. My friends didn't believe me so I would run their username or unique ID and tell them if I found them anywhere else. It wasn't accurate because I could only scan so many servers with my limited resources. Around this time I was a year and a half into a relationship with my now ex. She started to behave odd, more unavailable, etc. I got that gut feeling that something wasn't right. We were at this point long distance (since I moved overseas for a couple months to study stuff) and so our method of communication was via the Teamspeak server I ran for my community. One very insecure night I ran her unique id and username through the database and found her on another server. Typically she was in a channel with a few other people but almost always 1 on 1 with some guy from the UK. Everytime she said she was "busy" she would almost always be talking to him. At this point it was fairly obvious what was going on... but I decided I needed final confirmation so I went into their channel on an alt while they were in a group chat... I hung around long enough to get the picture. I set my avatar to a picture of us together and I poked her to check out my avatar. She went dead silent after that and muted herself to connect to my Teamspeak server. I then banned her from my server with the message "I don't date hoes" or something. And that was that. Thanks Python! You spared me.
Hey so I just replaced all of my intersects with regular AND clauses. Not only does it work just fine, but it's also a lot faster especially when there's a lot of them. I thought I had tried this already but I must have been doing it wrong. Glad I tried again! For reference, it now looks like SELECT * FROM Items WHERE EXISTS ( SELECT 1 FROM Tags WHERE Tags.item_id == Items.id AND Tags.tag == "horse" ) AND NOT EXISTS ( SELECT 1 FROM Tags WHERE Tags.item_id == Items.id AND Tags.tag == "jessica" ) ORDER BY ... 
It's probably not in the project environment, but it may be in the root environment. Via command line, run the command activate myenv conda list But replace myenv with your environment
We've just finished an update to [amzSear](https://github.com/asherAgs/amzSear) - the unofficial Amazon search CLI &amp; Python API. Support for new regions, a whole new API structure as well as many command line features have been added to make searching Amazon easy without need for access to Amazon's Product API. [See more here](https://github.com/asherAgs/amzSear#whats-new)
Build it in flask and have an webpage as front end. Python sucks at UI and UI is all JavaScript is good for.

Suggestion 1: ditch password. I use public key login with no password. In fact, password login is disabled. Suggestion 2: try to use a different ssh client. 
Delete the old one. It doesn't take that long to reinstall it.

Can I pitch my book? ;) - Test Driven Python Development on amazon
I could reply you better if you had pointed out a few things that are wrong in the roadmap (or better suggested how it can be improved). Anyways, here is my humble opinion on the things that you commented on. &gt; There's no one path; everyone finds their own path, and it's usually guided by the needs of whatever they're working on. While I partially agree with this part, students in college or the people who are stuck at a job where they don't get to try many different things that are used in the market, it gives them a clue of what they still have to learn. &gt; Articles like this always come across as little more than the author saying, "Look at all the things I've heard of!" I would have agreed with you on this if you said this on the old roadmap, this one gives all the steps and gives the explanation of when to do what and is not mostly focusing on the technologies. Plus I have been working for the past 5 years in this stuff and have worked on several large-scale applications belonging to different domains, so based on my experience, I can say that I have a better idea of what and in what order to suggest instead of suggesting the random things that "I've heard of".
This is not the right place to ask. There is /r/learnpython for this. Secondly, you're an idiot if you have no python knowledge and then just want to jump into computer vision. Go learn the basis of the language, play around with it, get comfortable and then try an opencv tutorial. Opencv is what most would regard intermediate python. 
Well django has a built-in testing framework and integration. If you're talking about whether the services are up and running then there are another set of tools relating to the containers and another within the containers. Lastly if you run a service its quite common to have another machine that doesn't have a hardware coupling (not a vm on the same machine etc) to the machine running the services that checks the service... So maybe clarify what you mean by test then we can direct you better. 
Share your current code then, as it would be best to be able to see where to help.
Twilio is a good option...and I use https://www.clockworksms.com/ here in the UK
Well, i'm talking about really obscure stuff like custom languages written for database systems on mini computers. As for forth: https://www.gnu.org/software/gforth/ and "brew gforth" actually worked. :) Now, I haven't touched Forth code it in 20 years, so I'm sure I haven't a clue what to do with it. :)
Just a short idea, to create a "point of truth" based on anomized data, is a common thing in the datawarehouse development. One of the commons, but dirtiest way, is to create a even granularity over the different sources. After you did it, you weight them, with the percent of people they are representatig over all sources. After that you can do a weighted merge. Not the best, but a quick win. There is a reason why it is so hard to merge them :P
Currently i am implementing a Factory for Airflow to dynamically generate DAG, so we can reduce the development time in our ETL-Development
From memory it used numpy and scipy and I think it may have pulled the entirety of both. I don't remember which setup I used to freeze the packages and I'm sure there are better ways than the one I used but it struck me as a really clunky and inelegant process. It would be great to have an officially sanctioned way to package standalone applications
Python is pretty enough for a CRUD but I heard good things for using Go for backend. I really think this is a good project for you to learn, 1- a compiled and very good language 2- a different perspective for web development.
Nice explanations:-) A totally unrelated and I'm just writing because I think this is neat, is that this line &gt; self.connections = defaultdict(lambda: 0) can be replaced by self.connections = defaultdict(int) as ``int()`` returns 0. Likewise, you can do * for lists, ``defaultdict(list)`` * for dicts, ``defaultdict(dict)`` * for sets, ``defaultdict(set)`` etc. I like the readability of this way of setting up defaultdict. 
This is pretty nice. Finally I can remove pandoc dependency for submitting to PyPI (Markdown -&gt; ReStructuredText).
Thanks, I'll check it out when I get home from work tonight :)
Use python for a web backend with django or flask or something, and use chartjs in your templates in the front end. Might not look exactly the same but it will be pretty close.
I didn't know that /r/learnpython was a thing. I'll post there in the future. Secondly, I knew vision stuff would be above my ability. I was hoping to get a feel for the kind of things that it uses so I don't get so board when the beginner stuff inevitably does some version of "hello world". It is easier to sit through the basics if I have some idea where it is all headed. Thank you for your time :)
Here's a sneak peek of /r/learnpython using the [top posts](https://np.reddit.com/r/learnpython/top/?sort=top&amp;t=year) of the year! \#1: [My new book, "Cracking Codes with Python" is now available and free to read online!](https://np.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/7sigre/my_new_book_cracking_codes_with_python_is_now/) \#2: [I'm releasing a free code for the "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python" Udemy course](https://np.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/7fxork/im_releasing_a_free_code_for_the_automate_the/) \#3: [I made a python cheat sheet](https://np.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/82t191/i_made_a_python_cheat_sheet/) ---- ^^I'm ^^a ^^bot, ^^beep ^^boop ^^| ^^Downvote ^^to ^^remove ^^| [^^Contact ^^me](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=sneakpeekbot) ^^| [^^Info](https://np.reddit.com/r/sneakpeekbot/) ^^| [^^Opt-out](https://np.reddit.com/r/sneakpeekbot/comments/7o7jnj/blacklist/)
1. https://pypi.python.org/pypi/filetype 2. https://pypi.python.org/pypi/filemagic 
Try /r/learnpython This will read the data of the file at `/path/to/file` as bytes, this works for any file type: with open('/path/to/file', 'rb') as fobj: file_data = fobj.read()
Yeah that's very easy in vtk. Vrk is the backend package that you can include in an application. Mayavi and paraview are wrappers around vtk that also include scripting, but have their own gui. Your case sounds pretty basic in vtk. Soet of depends what you want beyond simple static visualization like animated gifs or fringe plots, etc.
Do you have a a story for a good usage of Go? All I've seen so far are implementations that can be summed up as "if this was python the codebase could actually be maintained".
Add cython &amp; pyinstaller support?
This looks like a great course! Thank you - I wish whoever downvoted would have explained why..
Hey I can help, I teach Python on regular basis. Let me know
It's great that you've listed out all the relevant tech in one place. A couple things crossed my mind as I was reading it: Needs more emphasis on testing from the beginning. When I got to step 7, I groaned because "now go back and write tests for all the code you have that already works" sucks. You know all that manual code-run-fix work (x100) you normally do when you're writing new code? Just do that in tests instead. That's part of what TDD means. The main reason I love TDD is because it makes writing tests more fun. Also, building the right solution for the job has two parts: 1. Knowing what tech is out there 2. Choosing the right tech #2 is by far the harder one. It's hard to know that in six months your awesome streaming aggregation framework is going to feel like a steaming pile and you're going to wish you'd just stuck with batch jobs. And it's hard to know ahead of time that paying for AWS SQS may have cost more, but the time it would've saved you because you didn't have to operate your own Kafka cluster would've paid for it 10x. Good advice for choosing tech is also boring. For 90%+ of apps: - Use Postgres and write a stateless API, until metrics or necessity drive you to other tech - Try to avoid operating your own DB or anything with persistent storage (like Kafka, Redis, etc.) Btw, you should recommend Postgres as a starting point rather than MySQL. I thought this debate was over and Postgres had won years ago. (I say this as the backend guy at a startup where "migrate from MySQL to Postgres" has been on my todo list for about a year)
Always the boss. The business unit is worth 3.6 Billion annually. So I get to make a small app that looks like it has a big profile. Remember it was closing the gap on open territories so it wasn’t growth, it was a hedge against sales loss. 
That and it was breaking it out into dimensions for our sales hierarchy. The model I had little to do with, that was all data scientists. I was more the front end user and backend integration with the order management system. Both would have been useless without the other.
No, it isn't enforced, which is precisely what makes it a guideline rather than a rule.
You will find that when you are a product manager as I was at the time that you are given problems like “How do we protect ourselves from the large sales rep turnover?” And you have to go build a solution that addresses it. Being in the position I was I had plenty of resources and few architectural constraints, which is why I could use Python for this one. I have rarely innovated for my company just for the fun of it. I am a solutions architect now, which gives me that luxury, but that took 5 years of the grind to get here. You are usually so overworked that you have to just pick which problems are the most bang for the buck and just go with those. 
Code is not properly formatted therefore I won't look at it. It sounds harsh, but too many people do it, and it makes it very difficult to read. It's not worth my effort regardless of how important it is to you. Four spaces before a line formats your code e.g.: print("See how it should look.")
That’s if ur lucky.
You don't want to read files for file sharing. You just want to send them as bytes.
Thanks you, quite a good one and a timely one at that 
Sounds like fun, thanks for replying
In the official app code is always ill-formatted. But i think you ate right
Oh wow they are expensive seems like I have to stick with Twilio 
Thanks for the suggestion Twilio was my first option 
Um, I've seen it done and practiced in from my exercises or whatnot, but I've never tried it in this way, will try that today, thank you.
`isinstance(646, (float, int))` This belongs to /r/learnpython/ 
I was trying to figure out how to do that, but wasn't able to find a clean removal method. Any suggestions? 
This I will also definitely check out! Thanks for the suggestion :)
This I will also definitely check out! Thanks for the suggestion :)
OK thanks, So there is no mutual type ?
It's always possible to look for work. You may even find someone willing to hire you. But be aware that knowing the language is only about 10% of being a successful software engineer. Knowing data structures, when to use what algorithms, how to design for various situations, etc is a much bigger part and it's doubtful that course teaches those things. But many (most?) graduates don't know a lot of that either, so don't take that too hard. You are entry-level or below, which you seem to be aware of (something that's *not* usually true of new graduates.) You aren't going to find a "can I just show up and write code without you paying me" job, though. But you could start trying to contribute to some open source projects. That's a good way to build up experience and a resume in the way it sounds like you want.
thanks for the answer, and clearing things up. i actually used read and write binary for a while but for some reason i did not pay enough attention. thanks for clearing things up !
that is also a valid point. so if i get a file pointer / IO wrapper object in python to that file, i can send them as bytes across the wire without doing F.read() ? 
thats the problem, the file could be anything. so do i have to put code which determines the extension and encoding for every file out there? or is there kind of a universal way to read and send them. from the other replies im guessing reading them in as bytes would be enough.ill try that.
Close tickets in ansible, you will make friends who know about jobs in Python, same with django 
I never done this to, but I was trying to figure how to transferee the logic from one project to the data and this make click with your problem. I think that i can do something similar with mine.
I'm not 100% sure what this gets me compared to pbr, poetry, or setup.py, but it appears to still be more like setup.py in that you specify a build.py file rather than a static piece of configuration like pyproject.toml or pbr's use of setup.cfg
Lots of pytest with a Flask and SQLAlchemy project.
Been working on [anteater](https://github.com/anteater/anteater). Its designed to run as a CI gate tool and scans for strings that are set via regular expressions. Also any IP addresses, domains or binaries found are sent to the Virus Total API. This way it can be used to stop people checking in bitcoin miners, infected binaries, private keys, credentials files. It has an easy to use framework where you can add you're own regexp's, so for example if you want to stop developers using an old depreciated API / function etc, you can make an entry into a YAML file that stores all the strings: For example, [like this](https://github.com/anteater/anteater/blob/master/examples/deprecated_python_modules.yaml) or [this](https://github.com/anteater/anteater/blob/master/examples/security_risks.yaml) Would be very interested in if anyone feels this may be useful as a tool. It can run with Jenkins, Travis and most CI tools. 
use the abstract base classes in the [numbers](https://docs.python.org/3/library/numbers.html) module
Exactly what I was looking for
say that to my paycheck.
$100k+ in a slow moving corporate company in hcol area working 35hrs/week on the dot. My decision is based on my desired lifestyle.
I was annoyed that I sometimes saw long tracebacks with items which were not relevant to my code. I'm looking at you SQLAlchemy and Flask/Werkzeug. This snipped allows me to hook in an alternative Traceback format which highlights the stuff where **I** fucked up. Most of the times the exceptions originate from my code. Not from libraries I use. Obviously, this should be handled with care, and I don't know how much sense this makes in prod. Especially since it has a dependency on `blessings` which does not make sense in every project.
I'm more sad because i must admit that myself prefer Go after decades loving Python... Began with Go because of performance, but use it now for because of maintenability of projects. Maintenability first because the language is very simple and explicit, no magic to remember. Second because of static typing it's very easy to understand and evolve an app years after. Third because it's so easy to deploy, even with the lack of package manager (will be solved soon). And playing with goroutine is very fun !
Thank you! My teacher want us to create a web app included ajax and couple other things. I wanted to do it with Python and this will help me a lot.
Yes, I’ve taken it. I program in Python and skipped over R. There isn’t more Python than R, they’re both accomplishing the same programs; the course just goes over in both languages. It’s a great intro to Machine Learning. 
How does pytorch or tensorflow work then when they use the gpu to do all the heavy lifting?
FWIW, I use Tornado code for both client and server side websockets. No browser involved. I use websockets to gain access to stores over an existing port that allows HTTP traffic.
 I appreciate your work on Data Science. It's such a wonderful read on Data Science. Keep sharing stuffs like this. I am also educating people on similar technologies so if you are interested to know more you can watch this:- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ek7IdGhbXI
If you're lucky, you might nab a junior developer post somewhere. I got mine with Python + HTML + CSS, all pretty much beginner-ish (all right, I made a simple website with the latter and a simple game with the former, but that was all before I started working)
Perhaps GeoDjango? https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/ref/contrib/gis/
Ssome data structures are really fast. The case of the set is pretty interesting, having a better performance than the Redis one.
Don't work for free, ever. Contribute on open source projects if you'd like but don't work for free. Anyway, I wouldn't hire someone for free because if one day you're bored and you don't want to work what stops you? What makes great programmers is the ability to see the big picture. So if you only know Python, well you're kind of "useless" IMO. I'd suggest learning at least about database, how to use them properly and stuff. Learn about web development (not necessarily html/js/CSS) but at least how to build REST APIs. You might be able to get a job without this though, but I suggest you learn a bit more about development overall, not just the programming language :)
This is the "I code in binary" of websockets. So the fuck what? That's not what websockets were meant for. No one said you can't use them to read data off of some API, but websockets are generally meant for a browser server interaction, and is what this article described. And yeah sure you don't need to use Tornado or GUnicorn-- feel free to write your own websocket connection store with multithreading and some lru cache. No point in doing so though.
thanks but I am not sure why I need `fabric` for this. The error was that originally, the package I created was not being seen in the conda list, and then after fixing that the programs were not being accessible from the package. The solution was 1) get `conda-build` installed globally in conda and not in its own env 2) set up my custom package (`annovar-150617`) with the following files: $ cat annovar-150617/build.sh #!/bin/bash set -x -e install_path="${PREFIX}/bin" cp *.pl "${install_path}/" $ cat annovar-150617/meta.yaml package: name: annovar version: "150617" source: url: http://www.openbioinformatics.org/annovar/download/xxxxxxxxxx/annovar.revision150617.tar.gz 3) install it with these commands: source "$(CONDA)/bin/activate" &amp;&amp; \ conda-build annovar-150617 &amp;&amp; \ conda create -y -c local -n annovar-150617 annovar==150617 
Thank you so much
yeah that is what I normally use for 'static deployment' type situations where the program is always going to be running on the same system. I need a more scripted solution like the conda env here so I can deploy to various systems and have my dependencies set up without having to hard-code locations. Also this is subject to dependency conflicts. Thanks though.
I used websockets a while ago for my [Platypus](https://github.com/gmemstr/pogo) for realtime server usage reporting, it was surprisingly fun to implement in Python. I'd personally recommend Tornado but YMMV.
Try this... from lomond import WebSocket subscribe_json = u""" { "type": "subscribe", "product_ids": [ "BTC-USD" ], "channels": [ "level2", "heartbeat", { "name": "ticker", "product_ids": [ "BTC-USD" ] } ] } """ websocket = WebSocket('wss://ws-feed-public.sandbox.gdax.com') for event in websocket: if event.name == "ready": websocket.send_text(subscribe_json) elif event.name == "text": print(event.text) You'll need to `pip install lomond` for that.
Thanks dude!!!
Great article!
Huh, interesting. Are there any cryptocurrencies written in Python or some commercial implementation of Python and Blockchain? Would really like to see how efficient blockchain written in Python is compared to C++ and Solidity/golang/rust.
Well I just made my first non-trivial, non-school project, a simple discord meme bot. I'm planning on setting up a home server over the weekend so it can have nearly 100% uptime. It was pretty fun. I want to make something else but I'm not a very creative person.
If you are using gevent, then you probably want [gevent-websocket](https://pypi.org/project/gevent-websocket/), which is not listed in the article.
EDIT: I'm using: * Windows 10 (64 bit) * Python 3.6.5
I realize this might not be the right subreddit, going to post it to r/learnpython too
It's one of the highest rated &amp; best seller course on udemy and it has 60 lectures with 6 hours duration. You can think about that &amp; I suggest you to preview this course. Honestly I can tell at this time I haven't have enough money to buy this course but the contents are good. 
Yes go for it. The Google Cloud Speech API is currently the best free API I feel.
Did you try it with something that is actually base64 encoded instead of random giberish? Like: base64.b64decode("aWQxMHQK")
&gt; Do you know if there is a way to set as default the Python 3.6 environment over the base 2.7 environment? No, there's not an easy way. You always need to activate your 3.6 env and start to work on it.
You're making $180k+ writing PHP? I doubt it.
The article list crossbar.io, which en strongly advice everyone to give a try. Not the easier thing to start with, but what you can do seems black magic.
Panda's replace allows you to replace multiple values in a column using a dictionary - https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.replace.html Something like this: df.replace({'street': {'Paper Street': 'Rock Street', 'Scissors Street': 'Rock Street'}}) 
Ah, bummer. Thanks for the advice!
The free ones are going to suck, you'd probably need to use Watson if you need any sort of accuracy: https://www.ibm.com/watson/services/speech-to-text/
I love the line, but with emphasis added &gt; The format MUST be able to: &gt; &gt; * ... &gt; * Be reverse engineered. Datasets often live longer than the programs that created them. _A competent **developer**_ should be able to create a solution in his preferred programming language to read most NPY files that he has been given without much documentation. This is my concern often with any binary format. Even if it is a very good, self-describing format (e.g. HDF5), it is still binary. When I can handle the performance and size tradeoffs, I much prefer a text-based format because then "_a competent **user**_"" can reverse engineer it. But, that absolutely comes with tradeoffs. And when dealing with large data sets, they may not be worth it. As an aside, if I were given a `.npy` file, but, hypothetically NumPy went the way of the dodo 30 years ago, how would I go about decoding it?

Hey, you can check out https://www.codecademy.com/learn and https://www.codecademy.com/learn Good luck! 
I haven't been able to form an opinion on most of what you've linked, however, &gt; Remove command &gt; The remove command will only remove the package specified but not its dependencies if they are no longer needed. &gt; You either have to use sync or clean to fix that. This seems to be more or less a common thing in dependency management (not removing dependencies when removing a dependent)-- and personally I find it better. For example I may install superbigdependency which depends on smalldependency, and then find out I can refactor just to use smalldependency.
May things, but it finally worked. I was following [this](https://stackoverflow.com/a/43971456) When I saw **vcruntime140.dll** was already in C:\Windows\System32\ I completely missed I had to copy it into C:\Python36\libs
One option I have used when trying to figure out if a string can be represented as a numeric data type is: def isnumeric(input): try: float(input) return True except ValueError: return False print(isnumeric('15')) # True print(isnumeric('1.3e4')) # True print(isnumeric('hello')) # False print(isnumeric('inf')) # True -- Should it be? But this **is hacky** and has edge cases like the one at the end of the snippet 
What hypervisor is the VM running in, and is it the same on both hosts? This likely isn't really a python question but more a question for windows/experts with that hypervisor.
"If the GIL is in effect, it is a Lock, and only one thread can run at a time. With CPU tasks, the GIL will be in effect. If multiple CPU tasks are being run on the same Python process, the GIL will block the additional tasks if they are non yielding until one completes and the GIL is released. Yielding means non-blocking, so the use of Threads or the yield statement in Python for example are non-blocking if the task itself doesn’t block. The GIL is released when doing I/O. I/O invokes built-in operating system C code, so the GIL is released and then reacquired when the I/O completes. This means that threads can be used in Python to improve I/O program performance." This is a common understanding of how the GIL works but isn't the entire story. I along with a colleague were recently working on adding multithreading support to [Wallaroo](https://github.com/wallaroolabs/wallaroo) and were getting results we didn't expect. The GIL will be released periodically to prevent a CPU bound, long running task from monopolizing a thread. This can result in very unexpected results if you don't realize the GIL works in that fashion. In Python 2.x series, the GIL is released on a fixed time interval. In the Python 3.x series, its based on number of instructions executed. You can learn more about this at: http://dabeaz.com/python/UnderstandingGIL.pdf And also in the "pre-emptive multitasking section of: https://opensource.com/article/17/4/grok-gil

In this case you can add smalldependency to your pyproject.toml file. poetry remove superbigdependency poetry add smalldependency But if you no longer need superbigdependency or any of its depencies, why would you want to keep them?
Does it have to be a .exe, or would a batch script in a folder work? The "embeddable zip file" distribution works pretty great for what you're doing.
Honestly that's a syntactical preference you have as the build.py python is all configuration. What it does is automate things including the creation of your setup.py and packaging.
&gt;Does it have to be a .exe, No it doesn't. I just need a way to execute Python on any machine without having to install the interpreter first. &gt;or would a batch script in a folder work? I was writing batch scripts before. The main problem is maintainability as the script keeps on getting larger. &gt; The "embeddable zip file" distribution works pretty great for what you're doing. You mean CPython? 
Very interesting. I will try it out. Thank you.
No problem. It's how I distribute my Python games to Windows users. The Python-to-exe tools that are out there really are not user friendly. It really works out well when I can't guarantee that the destination machine doesn't have Python installed.

I'm working on a project makes use of the CoinMarketCap API. Users are able to import a file (coinmarketcap_data.py) and use its functions to get live data for cryptocurriencies. Would love to get some more people' input on additional thinks to include! https://github.com/Pr0gramist/coinmarketcap_data 
haha, me too actually, even after writing that: I do have to say though after doing all that code spelunking print just makes more sense as a function
&gt; rather than log an entire exception I want to just grab the line of code that caused the issue That's a terrible idea. Real code will not be `z = 100 / 0`, it will be `z = x / y`. You need to know where x and y came from to fix the problem. 
Jupyter is an organisation/ project which has some products for Julia, Python, R, possibly others. Jupyter makes iPython, which is a python REPL (i.e. what you can type lines of python into and get immediate results). It has nice usability features but isn't fundamentally different to "normal" python. Jupyter also makes jupyter notebooks, which used to be called iPython notebooks. They are a web-based interface in which you can write, visualise and execute python code in cells. They're pretty good for exploratory hacking and an excellent way to present code snippets to others, but they're not a fully-featured IDE. Spyder is. An IDE is an editor with lots of integrated features for development - code introspection, built-in documentation viewer, integration with version control, frameworks and so on. The line between an editor, particularly an extensible one like atom or vim, and an IDE, can be blurry. I suspect you have been using python via jupyter notebooks, and that your education didn't cover the difference between the language (/implementation) and the tooling. When someone says "framework" they tend to mean a large all-in-one library for particular applications - like Django is a web framework, tensorflow is a machine learning framework and so on. It sounds like you know some python. I encourage you to test that knowledge outside of the tools you're familiar with - either in a different editor/IDE or in the command line.
Quick as solution if you're on Anaconda would be to run import numba Turn your code into a function and put an @jit operator above the function Otherwise you can vectorise your 'if not' code in Numpy, I don't really get what you're doing but either of those will help.
I’ll look into numba. I’m just using the simple python idle, but pip makes installing new packages too easy. The if not code isn’t nessecary also, I probably should remove that and just check the whole array beforehand to make sure it’s within the allowed ranges.
That's just a random example and not representative of the code I'd be returning. In the places I want to do this, having that line of code would be more useful than where it came from - mainly because its telling a non-programmer they did something wrong. Long version: I'm using configparser to pull in values from a .ini file. If the file looks for a section+key that doesn't exist I want to explicitly state "You don't have [KEY] in [SECTION] in config.ini". That said, maybe there is a better way of handling that, but I figured the easiest option is on a KeyError, grab the line and pull out the Section and Key that caused the problem and make a plain text error vs pointing at code for the non-techy people that might need to run it.
Looking at the bit about dependency resolution, it seems the version poetry installs is not valid: ###pipenv returns Could not find a version that matches pbr!=0.7,!=2.1.0,&lt;1.0,&gt;=0.6,&gt;=2.0.0 ###while Poetry will get you the right set of packages: ... - Installing pbr (0.11.1) ... Assuming the restrictions found by pipenv are correct, there is no version that fits &lt;1.0 and &gt;=2.0.0 so pipenv's message is correct and v0.11.1 doesn't fit. Are the restrictions not correct?
As a non-American, I was interested in seeing the questions and completely off topic to this project but 28. What is the name of the President of the United States now?* - Donald J. Trump - Donald Trump - Trump Do they really judge any of these to be incorrect? Sure, they're varying in precision but none of them are actually wrong.
Yeah that'd save alot of time rather than looping through. Anywhere you can replace the for loop with a Numpy vectorised operation will save you alot of time. It's not exactly clear what you are mapping to what can't really help more. Best of luck
Also you may struggle installing Numba outside of the Anaconda/Miniconda environment
I would open the source file and go to the line. Otherwise I believe you need to attach a debugger and decompiler to the process. The interpreter will be running compiled bytecode.
If the hypervisor is the same version there shouldn't be a difference. You'll have to ask people who know VMware better than me.

Yes, exactly!
Don't share code in images.
Before looking for something to spend money on maybe try a project or two and use resources like online documentation and stack overflow to get yourself started on whatever you don't know. Look into numpy/pandas for working with datasets. Matplotlib and/or dash for visualizing data. If those don't suit you/ projects you are interested in post back with what domain you want to get acquainted with. If you are starting from 0 back ground take a look at the anaconda python distribution and how to install packages. Some boot camps will offer a streamlined way of getting comfortable with the language but actually committing understanding comes from learning from mistakes or being driven to solve a problem. Nothings going to teach you faster than looking at a well documented package while solving a problem you are personally invested in. 
Okay, I've read this comment for a second time. I'm a bit confused. What is preventing you from doing this?: try: value = section[key] # or however you're doing this except KeyError: raise KeyError('You don't have {} in {} in config.ini'.format(section, key)) # or print it, or do whatever you want
its not exactly a just a syntactic preference. Because python can do anything, and the only way to determine library dependencies is by locally executing python code. So its not (afaik) possible to write tooling which just looks at static manifest files (like im sure cargo, npm, and everyone else does) which define a given package's dependencies. I'm not super well informed, but it seems to me that having such a dynamic build system as the standard is awful for all kinds of reasons
Can't say without seeing your code.
Well it seems like they're compiling differently. Are there ways that I can force them to compile the same way?

I understand what you are asking.. So, when you say "pure python" you mean that you are writing python code in a text editor (text editor, sublime text, etc..). In this method of python coding, you are simply writing code, saving it, then running the code. There is no step-by-step running of each line of code. In Jupyter Notebook, you are still writing python code, however, you can step through each line of code or chunks/blocks (in Jupyter they are called cells, I believe) of code. It's great for debugging and testing each line of code you write. However, Jupyter has it's downfalls. You can't save the file and run in like a "pure python" script. It is saved as a jupyter notebook. But, they have a "download as..." button and you can export as markdown, python, etc.. then send to others and run from console as you would a python script. Also, jupyter also struggles with running some libraries (I believe flask).. But Jupyter is awesome. Great for coding on the fly, testing, debugging, and showing (using "print" or "head") variables, dataframes, etc.. as you build them. 
thanks! Hmm they all seem to be returning the same thing: 2.7.14 (v2.7.14:84471935ed, Sep 16 2017, 20:25:58) [MSC v.1500 64 bit (AMD64)]
Visual studio code for sure is probably the best option at the moment. Integrates with git and has multiple terminals and solid python support for nice language specific features. Also updated frequently 
I've never used it but &gt; Integrates with git and has multiple terminals and solid python support for nice language specific features. Is pretty much every IDE. 
All I can recommend is to write test cases to isolate the differences; you won't regret it, in my experience test code pays dividends down the line when you least expect it.

I agree with your comment about the mouse. VIM is optimized for use with the keyboard.. For copying to the end of the line, you would do `y$`. This will copy the line to the end of the line. Or with `y2j`. If you want to use your mouse however, there will be issues sometimes. I barely ever use the mouse, touchpad these day
SWEET. i'm gonna check this out
I use Pycharm and I love it. But there are many other options out there that I haven't tried. I recently tried VS Code and that seems okay. The debugging might be an upgrade over Pycharm, but I think running your code is easier in Pycharm. 
IPython is upper case I. It's not an Apple product :-) 
Does struct basically let you go from bytes -&gt; human readable strings e.g. "play"? Or were you still dealing with "magic numbers" and trail and error to decode the IR messages?
Awesome 
Define headquarters :P Companies have to do things like * Pay tax * Get sued So the government will require that a company provides an address where they are "registered" and certain things that must be possible at this address. However, this address need bear no relation to where work actually gets done, but you can send them a letter there.

vim Powerful, unlimited shortcuts, reliable, and fast. There's the extra benefit that if you use lots of programmig languages you aren't installing lots of software left right and center, learning different keyboard shortcuts, and can use your features everywhere. You can get autocomplete via the youcompleteme plugin The learning curve is steeper than other IDEs, but I've always been happy with the payoff. It's up to you what you feel comfortable with.
The linked package, which is my first submission to PyPI (yay), is a recursive wordlist generator that accepts custom character sets for each string position. The current implementation features two functions: gen_wordlist builds the list in memory and writes it, which is fast gen_words is a generator that yields word for word, which is memory efficient but slower Any feedback is appreciated. Future plans include a possible PyCuda implementation.
Thanks for the info. I'll be sure to figure it out and use it in the future :)
MacVIM Atom
Which one does it not do? It does have an option for virtualenv (this is the only one I havent tried). Rope which is embedded in Python-mode does go to correct locations in `site-packages`. You can do `PymodeAutoLint`, which will do automatic pep8 formatting.. But its true that you have to fill it the holes yourself, unless you are start out with somebody elses vimrc: https://spacevim.org/, https://github.com/ets-labs/python-vimrc/blob/master/vimrc. I actually got started with amix/vimrc. Then added the python plugins later on.. **Regarding your point of good editors**: Knowing how to used your editor efficiently requires a bit of practice. You are using your editor for very long periods of time, and small improvements in efficiency have a significant impact. There are ofcourse a lot of editors. However, not all editors have been around for similar periods of time and have a large following. Both of these factors are important in choosing a editor. Here are the main reasons I use VIM: 1. Regardless of editors, typically people just dont start out writing plugins. They probably start out using the editor, then they start using plugins, then they modify the plugins using settings, then they start writing plugins. So only a small fraction of people who use a editor write plugins. Further, various editors have been around for various periods of time. VIM has been around the longs, similar to Emacs. If you check the Stackoverflow comparison: https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018/#methodology VIM usage is on par with all editors, but it has a much longer history. So if you have any task that you are doing repeatedly, you are more likely to find a plugin which will automate that task in VIM rather than in other editors. Unlike other editors, where you may have to write it yourself. Currently, you can probably also say the same about Emacs, but Emacs has a miniscule following compared to VIM. So, any new advancements, such as LSP are probably not goint to be ported to Emacs. So either Emacs will have to be embedded into something like Neovim, or its going to die a slow death. 2. The beauty of VIM is that its embedded in all Linux distros/cygwin/WSL/Mac OS etc etc.. So almost all programmers have to use it at some point or other. With the advent of NeoVIM, which now has separated the UI from the VIM backend, VIM will be embedded is likely to be embedded in all editors. This will mean the number of people who know about and use VIM will only increase, thus it will improve the plugin ecosystem more, compared to other editors. Because, VIM has a high learning curve, people just dont start using VIM, right away. Typically, they will use SublimeText, or NotePad, and then learn about VIM when they have to use some remote server, or have to use keybindings on Chrome. Once, they know about the power of VIM, and get somewhat used to the few key bindings, they will use it more and more, and gradually move over to VIM. 3. Because VIM is embedded in so many Operating systems, unlike Atom, Notepad++, SublimeText etc, and more recently Neovim being embedded in other editors, VIM is very very unlikely to die. Its more likely to gather more users than ever. The parallel betwen how VIM is embedded in various OSes, and NeoVIM being embedded in various editors, took me a while to realize, and I see this is a brilliant move. 4. Every couple of years, there always comes along a new editor (At one point, it was Gedit, pico, nano, Atom, sublimetext, recently), now its VScode. They do gain popularity for a short period of time, because they do some very good innovations and optimizations. But typically those changes get ported to VIM, and the cycle continues. Now a point against VIM: 1. VimL itself I hear is pretty bad language. Very few people have a incentive to learn it. VScode on the other hand, uses js, and there are indeed a lot of JS developers, who can easily write plugins. The good thing is that NeoVIM has made serios strides such that plugins in python/js can be written relatively easily. Hopefully, the core VIM developers are smart enough to understand the importance of plugins and Well thats my reason for using VIM over other editors. I would love to hear counterpoints.

&gt; I know you can use sys.exc_info() to grab the exception type, and a traceback that can be taken apart to find the file and line, but is there a way to get the actual code (short of having the script open the file and returning the contents of that line)? you can grab the frame, and grab the frame's `locals()` and `globals()`. But it's kinda useless anyway, because you have to deal with values buried deep in `list` and `dict`.

You'd be much better off using a standard high-performance format like HDF5, which can be used from any language and integrates with many other tools and services. For labelled data? Use [Xarray](http://xarray.pydata.org) (think "N-D Pandas") and store data as NetCDF (a structured subset of HDF5).
I turned my dissertation into a PDF from Markdown through HTML with PrinceXML as a renderer. See https://github.com/carlmjohnson/Watsuji-and-Aesthetics/
Great! I just sent a email.
Crap, ignore the mda0681 email, I accidentally used a school email! Look for micahadkins416@gmail.com
Can you explain a bit further with examples of what it does ?
 # my_first_algo.py algo = ‘\”output: hello world\” —- any advice’ 
this is a very bad way of asking a question
Seriously. It's just parsing strings at that point. 
Very cool. Just a heads up though, the audio is very quiet compared to other youtube videos.
thanks bro
Glad you enjoyed it and thanks for the feedback. I got feedback on earlier vids that the voice was too loud. Guess I went too far in the other direction :)
We get articles about iteration posted regularly here, but I think this was the best by a clear margin. Framing it as "gotchas, definitions, explanations" was a lot more interesting and intuitive than "definitions, examples" like usual. 
This is very cool! 
Glad you liked it :)
Best way is via the DOM tho
That's cool. May I see the link?
It's a bit long, don't you think?
Hello billsil, Sorry for the trouble. Thank you for the feedback. I am still learning. Will use this feedback in my research paper. Hope you can complete the survey. Thank you so very very much!

BS4 is Beautiful soup 4 - a python library for parsing html in alignment with the dom. Direct dom parsing is a JavaScript thing.
make it a habit to read official docs to become a good python programmer. eg: https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#func-str

I'm on my phone I don't have a sidebar. Im new to Reddit. 
Google the name of your reddit client and "sidebar"...
self.prettify
Your reddit client it whatever app you are using to browse reddit. If you're using a web browser, the sidebar is on the right. /r/learnpython's sidebar contains a link to a bunch of excellent learning resources.
I found the Learning Python book from OReilly to be a great “fill in all the blanks”/“how this really works” type of book. Link: [Learning Python](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920028154.do) I use pycharm for every python project nowadays. I started off just using a text editor (Sublime Text) but I ended up switching to pycharm once I started writing programs that are larger and had more files. IDEs handle a lot of the tedious typing and look ups and renaming operations for multi-program files and since they are aware of all the files and how they fit together, it can be faster to let the IDE suggest completions for you. In the end, it just comes down to what you're most comfortable in and what lets you express your ideas clearly and efficiently. 
Thanks for the reply! Who knew an auto parts store had such nice python books? I will take your suggestion and look into this book. My books have too many jokes and filler in them. 
thanks! 
thanks and i am new to reddit too!
I am aware. DOM is best, DOM isn't really about parsing, it's an API that allows you to easily traverse the document.
Gotcha thanks. I'm using Google chrome for Android. I can see sidebars on my PC but it wasn't showing up. Thanks for the learn python subreddit link. Didn't know that was a place. 
I resigned to using selenium with a headless chrome driver so I can make requests, have multiple tabs, click on the "load more" buttons. AFAIK BS4 is static parsing, ie, doesn't interact with a webpage. Is this correct or have I been missing 50% of BS4
I went with scrapy when I learned web scraping. It's slightly more difficult but way more powerful, especially with selenium
Thank you!
Have you tried pyquery? It used the DOM. I've found it to work very well, when I've tried it, but haven't used it for anything big.
I installed Anaconda for a package of different Python software. I used Jupyter Notebook as I begin studying python. It is also the best for fast trial and error. But right now, i used Spyder, which looks like a typical, basic IDE. I like its very simple interface which can you see: -Your editor screen -Console -Variable values Now I am curious about Visual Studio Code. and how was it different from Spyder. 
cad automation, processing excel files, calculations with gui, data entry automation etc. didn't do much though because no time, limited knowledge

Nexmo as well
This would say precisely which key
Not sure what the question means.
Nice stuff. It is annoying that as soon as you want to draw things in 3D the number of available tools decreases by so much. On the subject of mathematical YouTube channels, you may have heard of 3 Blue 1 Brown https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw, who makes seriously good maths videos with really cool visuals, which he just so happens to make with his own custom Python framework: https://github.com/3b1b/manim Though I don't think there's any 3D stuff in there.
Google wasn't the visionary; they bought Youtube who before that showed they could use Python with less engineers to out-innovate them I think.
Refactoring and cleaning up legacy code, and changing some parts from batch to microservice architecture. Does anyone have any book recommendations?
Jupyter really isn't an IDE. I mean no more than the standard IPython repl is.
I've used peewee in the past and I liked it very much. Will definately try huey, thanks!

There is a config.ini file that contains the default theme. On Linux, it's in the ~/.kivy/ directory. I don't know exactly where it would be in Windows or Mac, but I'd guess somewhere in the user's settings directory.
This is cool thanks
Yep. They bought YouTube to replace their falling Google videos platform... Which was coded in C++ and not python like YouTube. 
how would you make it dynamic?
How do you load 2 different tabs in selenium, I can't find it anywhere on the interwebs
apparently not :D
what's the difference between those three answers? what do they mean? &gt; We run unit tests on newly coded modules until they run flawlessly. &gt; Members of this team actively engage in unit testing. &gt; Unit tests are run extensively by this team. 1. if your tests do not run without error, your code or tests are broken and useless. of course they have to run "flawlessly". 2. how do you "engage in unit testing"? you write tests or you dont. 3. teams do not run tests. people write tests and they run automatically. that's the whole point. &gt; We have a set of agreed upon coding standards in this team. &gt; Everyone on this team uses a set of agreed upon coding standards for coding. is there a difference between the two? i stopped answering somewhere in the middle. it seems to me the questions and answers are very vague and any conclusion you could draw from them would be misleading and not reflecting reality. you should at least ask for the environment people work in (team size, employment status, type of company, size of company etc). maybe you do that in the end, but opening with questions about "this team" without any introduction is very confusing. 
This would work for every key... Unless your source code looks like this: foo = book_section['harry potter'] bar = medicine_section['paracetamol'] spam = bread_section['berliner'] eggs = dairy_section['yoghurt'] In that case, yeah, it's not convenient to do try/except for every key. But then can't you just do the following? def get_key_with_exception(section, key): try: return section[key] except KeyError: raise KeyError('You don't have {} in {} in config.ini'.format(section, key)) foo = get_key_with_exception(book_section, 'harry potter') ... etc etc etc This isn't rocket science :/

Any plans to allow for self-hosting the server and/or open sourcing the python library? I could see this being quite useful for increasing the number of people who can build internal metrics dashboards.
I got a new twitter bot online. Right now it's a simple markov model that simulates Bob Ross phrases and tweets once an hour. Next up is to expand the corpus, move the bot to a raspberry pi, and migrate away from a simple markov model and try to implement a context free grammar instead. 
tl;dr most of the tweeties doesn't have any particular feelings about Brexit. A nice article for those who want to start with sentiment analysis.
Civil Engineer here. Flood lines. Hydraulics and Hydrology. Pipe network designs using EPANet. Terrain analysis using SAGA, QGIS and GRASS. Advice: Find software, preferably free and open source. Research its input and output formats. Maybe it has got a command line interface. Now, combine your whole deign workflow into Jupyter notebooks. Where you generate the input files, run the simulation and do the reporting. All from Jupyter. Now you have a complete documented workflow which can be re-used and adjusted for future designs. I have for example found a MS-DOS program that does Water Hammer calculations (Right up the alley for Mechanical Engineers). I would specify which part of my EPANet network should be analysed. My program will isolate the network section, run the simulation and plot the graphs for the water hammer. 
I did something similar once for fun, simply using operator overloading (Py2/3 compatible): # echo.py from __future__ import print_function import inspect class Echo(object): def __mul__(self, a): (frame, _, _, _, lines, _) = inspect.getouterframes(inspect.currentframe())[1] args = lines[0].strip()[6:].lstrip("*") res = eval(args, frame.f_globals, frame.f_locals) print(*(res if isinstance(res, tuple) else (res, ))) return a echo = Echo() Usage: from echo import echo echo* "No braces, hooray", "x", 10

I’ve used pypyodbc to select records from mssql I don’t see why you couldn’t insert using the same method.
I used to complain about how users want a pretty gui and that text files are good enough. Well, then I built a gui for viewing Nastran FEA models just to validate coordinate system transforms and it's turned into a 30k line code around 80k lines of code. The core 80k lines have basically been done for 2 years out of 6 total. The gui is not. For most problems, I prefer it over Patran or FEMAP as it autochecks my models. I'd rather wait a minute to load and know it's mostly right.
Heads up that a couple of the questions about current senators and congressmen are location specific, so you may want to tweak the answers to match your location
I wouldn't consider it to begin with parsing strings, since you have to navigate to the site, and actually retrieve the strings prior to parsing. Trivial work, but it's there, nonetheless. 
Yes, I love his channel. My own stuff here is in fact, inspired by his. If you want to draw in 3d, follow these three simple steps - 1) Get all the 3d points of the 3d object you're interested in (start with a cube since its the simplest) 2) Rotate all the points (see rotation.py in my repository). 3) Ignore any one dimension and just take the other two and plot them like you would plot 2d objects.
That's awesome! Straight python fu like that is always so cool: it's really neat to me how much control you really have over the python interpreter without having to leave Python itself!
What do you think of Lupin? Worth getting in to and if so should I start at the beginning?
Some people just want to watch the world burn.
Sounds like a terrible idea.. but in the spirit of annoyance, it's simple, press ctrl + alt + f, then select comic sans. 
I will do! Promise. Great job by the way. 
Yeeee. First episode is about robbing a cryptocurrency reserve and there's a programmer in the main cast now. Very exciting!!
I am by no means any good with python. I’m learning myself. The things you describe should be possible, I think you may want to be careful with crawling websites. Some tend to be very against that. I really don’t know a way to find out for sure though.
Lupin is one of the more consistently funny long-running TV shows ever made. It has no continuity, so you can start at the beginning of any of the series or with a movie. I recommend starting with Part IV because it's very funny and also gorgeous by modern anime standards. Part V is going to have an internet theme to it, so you might be extra interested in that, if you're here. After you finish one of those, you can move on to Part II, which is the longest and the most "classic" show, or maybe *Castle of Caligostro*, and then anywhere else. It's a good, formulaic time that makes you feel comfy.
That sounds absolutely fantastic. Thank you for your reply that was such a great answer. 
Every complex problem is just a series of less-complex problems in a chain. Start by learning to break down the complex problem into smaller steps, then start solving those smaller steps one at a time.
What kind of monster ...?
Rust actually does compile down to machine code with deterministic performance, as much as any language can when running on a preemptive OS. My subjective opinion is that it is also very nice to develop in: not as simple as Python, but far better than C. 
Seems like a design by contract. You can use [deal](https://github.com/orsinium/deal) package for it. I try made it more simple and useful then alternative realizations :) 
How about using google to search for "FACEBOOK INC Headquarters" instead of "FACEBOOK INC"?

No.
Great project idea. Textblob is also a great library.
Papyrus would be more evil.
This is neato.
Create a function that concatenates strings. Define a function called join\_strings accepts an argument called words It will be a list. Inside the function, create a variable called result and set it to "" , an empty string. Iterate through the words list and append each word to result . Finally, return the result .
this is the question pls help someone
r/learnpython
hi i just realized i posted to the wrong section do you know how i can change it there
in results change " " to []
but the instructions told me to use ""
If you're wanting to learn programming, Python is a good high level language to do so. For these particular things, yes, Python would work. It sounds like your work is very Microsoft-centric, and you should just use whatever is the best tool, so if you try Python and have problems you could try PowerShell or whatever works.
You're iterating over a range object instead of your list of words. `for x in words:` `append` is a method for lists, not strings.
"".join(words)
You're close. You need to use `+=` for strings. `append` is for lists only. Also, you need to use the index to get the current word: result += words[x] --- If you have more questions like this it's better to post them on /r/learnpython. Be sure to [format your code for reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/faq#wiki_how_do_i_format_code.3F) or use a site like pastebin. Do not post images of code. Also, include which version of python and what OS you are using. 
range(len(words)) returns an array of ints. You want to use for word in words: ... Read the docs for range and Len, google is your friend
When you use 'range(len(words))' it is iterated through numbers not the words in the list. this works result.append(words[x])
Or in Python's shell just type `obj.` and tab, tab. It prints out the methods. (...on linux at least.)
The dyslexic among your students might actually appreciate this.

thanks. facebook still uses php btw :) but to break it down for you, full 401k match is ~$17k. Plus ESPP could easily push you over 50k in comp depend on how well the company you work for is doing. Bonuses are thing. Then add in insurances. Then add in other ancillary things like cost savings due to my company having a discounted cafeteria. there's more, but that's the most of it.
Glad it worked :) Curious to know what your aligning! I work on aerial survey imagery at the moment so doing familiar stuff.
Hyperspectal images but of food products. I’m aligning three different cameras but it’s worthwhile to do some alignment within each camera range to account for chromatic aberration. Do ya use hyperspectal at all in your line of work? I know it has some land use applications, I think it got it’s start there. Overall it’s a pretty interesting data analysis problem. My background isn’t really in data analysis but it’s a fun way to apply some physics knowledge.
WHAT! A new Lupin!? How could have missed this. Also loved L'avventura Italiana -- pure masterpiece.

**The Castle of Cagliostro** Lupin the Third: The Castle of Cagliostro (Japanese: ルパン三世 カリオストロの城, Hepburn: Rupan Sansei: Kariosutoro no Shiro) is a 1979 Japanese animated action-adventure comedy film co-written and directed by Hayao Miyazaki as his feature film debut. It is the second feature film featuring Monkey Punch's master thief Arsène Lupin III, from his manga series Lupin III. The film was Miyazaki's first time directing a theatrical feature after having previously worked as an animator for Toei Animation and Telecom Animation Film and directing several shows including Lupin the III and two episodes of Lupin III Part II. The Castle of Cagliostro follows gentleman thief Arsène Lupin III, who successfully robs a casino – only to find the money to be counterfeit. He heads to the tiny country of Cagliostro, the rumoured source of the bills, and attempts to save the runaway Clarisse from the Count Cagliostro's men. Lupin enlists his associates, Jigen and Goemon, and sends his calling card to the Count to get Inspector Zenigata, his longtime nemesis, to the castle. *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Python/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28
Maybe it's because I'm not used to it but I hate everything about the Pony syntax. 
I haven't used NumPy or scikit-image, but [according to this](http://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/api/skimage.data.html), data just holds easy to use test images. The [getting started](http://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/user_guide/getting_started.html) page shows an example on how to load your own images: import os filename = os.path.join(skimage.data_dir, 'moon.png') from skimage import io moon = io.imread(filename)
Okay, if you're going to include all those things, then of course more specialized jobs are paying a lot higher. &gt; thanks. facebook still uses php btw :) That's a massive oversimplification of the truth. When Facebook was a side project written in a dorm room, it was written in PHP. That simply wasn't suitable for a site that grew to such scale, though. These days, the presentation layer is written in Hack, a PHP-inspired language that includes things like static typing, and it runs on a JIT virtual machine called HHVM. The backends are written in (at least) C, C++ and Java. Chat is written in Erlang. (They use Haskell, OCaml and Ruby too, but they are not powering the web site.)

I had a section of code that was processing content scraped from emails. Usually the text of the emails was in regular plain text, but sometimes it was base64 encoded. This function I wrote will leave non-base64-encoded text along, but will transform text that is base64 encoded back into its original format. Feel free to use it for whatever you want! 
Hi Al, Just sent you an e-mail. Thanks for doing this
This isn't a technical issue. Many programmers use a language because they like it.
Just set an email. Thank you for this.
Thanks all!! I’ll give these ideas a shot!
How does that get you the source code?
Hey Al, just sent you an email. Thanks for the opportunity! :) 
Will do
Fantastic! Just about finished with your "Automate the Boring Stuff" so this will be fantastic. Thanks Al!
&gt;because it is ugly and &gt;written in bash I think I missed a step or two in the logic here.
Have you looked at waybackmachine. They have many of the blog stories there from clusterhq.com
You might try the Wayback Machine: https://archive.org/web/ Be sure to check out some of the higher weighted modules listed here, some will have examples. https://pypi.python.org/pypi?%3Aaction=search&amp;term=state+machine&amp;submit=search also, if you like PyCon conference presentations: https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3A+pyvideo.org+state+machine&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-b-ab There is lots of unbeatable content on that site.
I've checked wayback machine yes, but so far no dice from any of the snapshots taken :(
Thanks, but no luck so far from the wayback machine. My favorite FSM library so far is [transitions](https://github.com/pytransitions/transitions)
This is very much appreciated. I just sent you an email
Thanks Mr. Swaggart 
Thanks for doing this Al. Loved Automate the Boring stuff. I'm reading it for the second time again. I'd be keen to do a review for your. 
Write more things Al! It would be great to have your voice applied to a more intermediate python focused book! 
&gt; there is a lot of subdependencies included In general I prefer that, because it results in a stable environment. If subdependencies are not included, when you pull them down at build time, they might change a minor version a break something.

Exactly like that. I did not find a way to properly dynamically use product for a CLI, which is how this project was mainly meant to be used. If there is a way to do so, I would be more than happy to use that. What I mean is that I need to perform product on a dynamic number of strings, that would be generated from the dictionary's values.
There's already at least on project that does that: [pip-chill](https://github.com/rbanffy/pip-chill). It's also possible to use pip list --not-required to get this list (but not in a requirements.txt format). And now there's [pipenv](https://docs.pipenv.org/).
I just sent an email, can’t wait to see what the talks been all about. 
As much as I like 3B1B's videos his viz lib don't look like it has any production quality for people exept himself. Here some reasons: * It supports only py 2.7 * It isn't realy structured like an actual module you will see at pipy * there is no setup.py, *installing* means cloning and pip install the reqs, or use the docker container * Nothing is tested, a huge no-go for production quality tools * No CI, that doesn't invite other people for forking and pull requesting * the whole structure looks like it is just his work directory, just a git repo to store his actual work, there are even folders for actual and old projects * There is no documentation, not even simple ones in the readme, not really useful for new users * from a brief look he uses his own distinctive programming and code style, not so good for others to contribute Since he uses that repo for his personal projects these flaws are completely okay, but providing it as another viz lib is too far stretched at this point. Also from the open pull requests view it looks like that is not really his intension. Personally I think turning this into a real framework for other people would mean a massive rewrite or a complete restart from scratch.
Emailed! Automate the boring stuff was an awesome read and super informative. Can't wait to read this one. 
Fuck yeah, thanks. 
I just made [this](https://pastebin.com/y070LGWf) it's a budget helper tool to help me when I do my budgeting. It has the functionality to open my banking and budgeting web pages with 1 keypress. It asks for the values of the accounts, cash on hand, and miscellaneous cash sources I have and then displays them back to me in one spot so I can easily put the data into my budgeting software without tabbing back and forth/ using scratch paper/ doing any arithmetic. And there is also a quick adder so I can quickly tabulate multiple transactions from the same category when going through my statements. because I stop at a corner store almost every day and pick something up I have a lot of small, unique transactions on my statement. I can tab them in quickly here by just entering the value and pressing enter. I will have all the values displayed to me as I go and then I get the summed up value at the end with the category name so the output ends up like '1.62 + 3.24 + 1.62 + 7.68 + 22.56 + .97' Total spent in Gas Station category is 37.69 and then I can just add 1 transaction in my budgeting software of 37.69 instead of 6 different small ones, and I don't have to do any of the arithmetic either, no calculator, scratch paper, etc and I have the ability to choose between each of those functions in main and the functions will give the option to exit to main to choose a new one at their end. I am only a few weeks into all of this, if that actually. But I was sitting there doing my budget the other day and realized I actually had a solid application and use cases to put my little amount of knowledge to work - and to my surprise, what basic things I know plus a little google-fu and about 3 hours all said and done, I made a really helpful tool for myself! It's the first time I've ever created a useful program with an application in my actual day to day life, so it feels really good to have made something like this. I also learned a lot. Feel free to pick it apart and give suggestions on how to make things better if you see what I am doing. I know for a fact it's probably too verbose and sloppy, but I just sort of slammed it out and like I said I am new as hell. So. Any tips appreciated because I have no idea what I am doing I just know it does what I need! 
Forgive my laziness, but is this a real alternative to BASH? I'm only now starting to learn P, mainly for sysadm/scripting stuff, and I'd love to give it a try. IF it's more that jist a proof-of-concept that is.
I'm not anti-establishment, but I never thought I'd get to a point where I would say "thank God for the CIA" with a straight face. Then I found the Factbook. If you ever find yourself, for some weird reason, arguing about whether there is a mandatory military service in Djibuti (there is, if I recall correctly) or not, then you will too be glad the ol' Company has your back.
Hi Mr. Sweigart, I think I can speak for the whole community on this subreddit when I say thank you for this opportunity. I have sent you an e-mail and am looking forward to your response. Thank you for your time and generosity
Email sent!
Yes, I had some of the same concerns and that's the reason I started mine (https://github.com/ryu577/pyray). Can't say it addresses all of your objections above, but I've definitely put in the effort to make it well documented, easy to use for anyone (minimal dependencies, low start up cost) and easy to contribute to.
This is great! Thanks!
Email sent!! Thank you!!
Awesome! Automate was an amazing book I can't wait to read the new one, email sent.
I have been really interested in mongoDB for the last few weeks. I have leveraged mongomock to be able to mock out pyMODM queries using a decorator. You just pass it the data that can be queried, and voila: you have mocked the model's query! I am planning on open sourcing this into its own package, as its currently living inside of a private codebase for a website I have been working on. First I have to smooth out some differences between pyMODM and mongomock. So I guess my week will be spent making pull requests for mongomock!
Assuming I dont live in the US but I still want to read your book and extract the knowledge, can I still apply for it?
By Excel you mean the online version right?
Sure. I can send you the ebook, I just won't be able to mail you a print copy.
This is awesome!
That's cool, I'm just keen to learn more, if I ever get around to reading through and remember; ill throw a review up on amazon. Ill send through my Email in pm. 
Thank you!!!
Sounds awesome, thanks for doing this. In the middle of Automate the Boring Stuff and couldn't be happier with it so I'm guessing Cracking Codes is great too!

My company has quite a few micro services in Python (tornado and django) and a few go apps. Switching between the two languages I must say that I really like go. Python is super easy and I can crank out some quality code. Go takes a little more time building structs, especially if I’m mapping to some json object. Ive heard good things on Buffalo which is go’s answer to django. Maybe give that a look if your app is connecting to a relational db. 
On MacOS and Linux you can create a folder called `~/.jupyter/custom/custom.css` and paste the following snippet: ``` body { font-family: "Comic Sans MS", cursive, sans-serif; } ``` I don't know how to do this in Windows.
That book got me a raise. 
It’s not both, it’s the later. “Go” was a stupid name choice.
I have no idea why for a pip written and consumed file I care if it is ugly, I care that it rebuilds the venv exactly or dies
I'm not living in the US but I'm gonna read the book online anyway and post a review on Amazon just because I like your idea. Kudos!
Too bad I'm not living in the US. Great idea Al! Looking forward to your sequel to ATBS!
I'll can still send you the ebook version to review though, just not a print book.
Thanks for sharing this. Would it be possible to solve this with [pip-tools](https://github.com/jazzband/pip-tools)? 
I love this lib. Mind specifying what's new? EDIT: nm https://uplink.readthedocs.io/en/latest/changes.html
Hey /u/willvintage - actually, Gridarrow works with Windows Excel 2010+ 
Eager to move my project to use this. I may have missed this in the docs, but is there a way to "migrate" from an existing traditional dependency setup to use Poetry? That would make it slightly easier to use this

Power BI is an awesome tool if you're looking for a web based dashboarding tool, but Gridarrow is quite different in a couple of major ways: * Whereas Power BI treats Excel as a datasource, Gridarrow is a *server for Excel*, where the data is pushed to Excel as soon as it is updated, and multiple Excel users can connect to the same data. * Gridarrow uses Python as the server side programming language, rather than relying on menus and widgets for configuration. Although this does mean that you need to know some Python if you want to connect to a datasource that's not already in [our catalog](https://www.gridarrow.com/docs/getting-started/#using-the-apps-catalog), it also means that you have absolute control over where your data comes from, and how it is processed or enriched before being sent to Excel. ps. I'm another dev on the Gridarrow team
Thank you for the opportunity to participate in this. Email sent. 
There are several books for intermediate python developers, you probably want to check them out.
I use [pip-tools](https://github.com/jazzband/pip-tools)
Well, if you'd still like an ebook to review, I could send you that.
But it just changes the markup, doesn't it? I would like to see the code in weird fonts! 
yes please! thank you!
This guy is GOLD!
Yeah, and even if God and the Pope think it's cool, the CEO will never get it right? :) We totally see and understand the need for a self-hosted solution, and we're working on it. If you think Gridarrow would be useful in your company, definitely PM me or /u/LazyCraneOperator here or send us an email hello@gridarrow.com. 
Hey Al, sent you an email. Love the initiative, thanks!
Awsome, thanks you!
In order to learn, go for something simple, well documented, and pythonic. I suggest simply starting with Tkinter. After you get comfortable with Tkinter, then it will be time for you to experiment with other toolkits and appreciate better their differences.
Look for the docs for the python FSM library machinist on readthedocs.org. That article looks like it was nearly 100% copied from that documentation. I believe the article author created machinist and also was part of the creation of the twisted framework. I'm going from 3+ year old memory... HTH
Already read it on the website. Very lovely book in your comprehensive and yet fun style. I am very grateful for the knowledge you share Al.
Happy Cake Day!
Tkinter's widget canvas can do that.
Actually pip-compile-multi is built on top of pip-tools. So yes, but you'll need a script to orchestrate and fix output. 
Tkinter can do anything ;) 
Tkinter can do anything ;) 
Thanks! I think I've spent more time on Readme, than on actual code. 
Zelle graphics, "graphics.py", which uses Tkinter I believe. Really easy to use. http://mcsp.wartburg.edu/zelle/python/graphics.py
https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html Go read through the documentation. I learn five new things every time I visit that page.
Also outside USA, would love to receive the ebook version. Email sent! 
After a brief look over your repo I have some recommendations for you: * Using packages would help to keep the repo clean and organized, that is fairly easy to do, create a folder for example your shapes, put in an empty file called `__init__.py` so that python understands this is an package and then put the according py files into it. Then you can import the modules in this fashion `from shapes.circle import generalized_circle`. How you structure the packages is up to you, but it will greatly increase the organization and the usabillity. * Tests would be great here. I recommend using pytest here. You have alot of mathematically functions, so writting tests for it comes in more natural than writting for other things. Good thing here, as soon as you want to refactor or optimize existing functions, running the tests gives you instant response if everything is still working as expected. And travis can ran the tests for you, so pull requests from other contributors are also automatically tested! * Turning your repo into an pip installable module will greatly increase the chance that other people will using your framework. That isn't that hard, usally a prepared `setup.py` will do the hard work for you. The great Kennith Reitz also has a [template repo](https://github.com/kennethreitz/setup.py) for the `setup.py` and all the possibilities. And remember, you can also pip install modules from git repos instead using PIPY itself if you don't want to publish your framework there yet. * Mixing loops and numpy arrays looks a little fishy, because usally numpy provides alot of functionality to use vectorization instead of plain iteration for the sake of speed. I am not a numpy expert but I think you can reduce alot of the iterations involving numpy arrays by deeping more into numpy itself. * You put effort into writing docstrings which is great, but I miss some needed comments to explains what happends with the code itself. * For the code itself, alot of it looks very unpythonic, for example using globals, C-style loops, above-average use of indecies, shadowing of built-ins etc. I don't want to discourage you in writting your own framework, but there is still a long way down the road. So keep coding and I hope my comments helps you learn more ;)
Not in the US but this looks like a pretty cool book to get someone into python. When do you expect it to go on sale?
Python isn't the best for traditional GUI apps. Might be better off making a website
Pyqt or pygtk
Hey; Thanks for the suggestions. Currently looking into Fluent Python and PyMOTW. I am not a CS guy or have any background into programming previously. Will Clean Code by Robert C. Martin or the pragmatic programmer by Andrew Hunt, David Thomas be easier to follow if I read it on my own?
As an idea, take a look at odoo www.odoo.com. Is a modular orm/CSM extensible by Python and XML. You can install It locally and create your application as a module, letting odoo manage user/permissions 
I most certainly will :)
Not in the USA but I don't care about a printed copy anyway. The subject sounds interesting though so if I ever get to finish it I promise a review. Thank you for providing your book online.

Ooh, nice homework assignment you got there.
PyQt. This is a wonderful framework that uses Qt framework (C++). This is a cross-platform solution. Easy to learn. But in my opinion you should stick to use web based GUI like Django. It depends on your needs.

First, it is a good idea to ask these kind of questions on /r/learnpython since this sub is intended for news and announcements. You are also going to have to be more specific about what you mean. What kind of website design are you thinking about? Does it really require Python? 
I started a project using MySQL about a year and a half. It ended up growing a lot and now it drives most of the operations at my work. We're in the process of migrating some other prices to it and now I regret of having chose MySQL. Postgres gives so much more flexibility that could be really useful for us. Sadly, the time for learning and migrating to something else is very limited so we're stuck on MySQL for now. Great advice, learn postgres.
Clean Code and the Pragmatic Programmer are more about coding best practises rather than teaching you how to write a line of code. They teach you how to look at problems.
Because BDFL [does not](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/#non-goals) will it.
There is http://mypy-lang.org/ It seems to me that the only thing missing is something similar to typescripts interfaces.
ECMA didn't will it for JS either.
I second the pyqt, since they have a very easy to use designer, taking the guesswork out of your initial layout. It does get complicated quickly though, so just be aware of what you’re getting into. It is standard with the most recent anaconda distribution. Most tutorials are on pyqt4, but pyqt5 has been around long enough there is some clear documentation on it, and that’s what I use. 
That's essentially what cookbooks are; search "python cookbook" on Amazon and you'll find several.
Thanks, the new ebook seems interesting 
Python unlike JavaScript is strong typed so the need for something like typescript is lessened. Instead you can use type annotations and either the mypy linter or your ides linter to enforce the typing. In effect, this gives you all the same benefits as typescript without much overhead.
Cannot participate, as not in the US, but wanted to shout to you /u/alsweigart. I used Automate The Boring Stuff With Python to teach a free python class in the Middle East. Big up.
I'm currently being force to use Python. I hate it. It's good for prototyping, but I wouldn't like to support a large project with it.
Author here. I have been playing with this idea for a while and it seems to be working fine. So I decided to put this as a python package. Feel free to share your opinion.
It's super interesting, thank you for providing it online!
This is awesome, thank you. 
The blog at pythonprojects.me hahaha
Javascript is loosely typed, Python is not.

The problem with your approach is that you're using a generator. Generators are inherently mutable (getting the next value mutates the state). In your example, you don't even need a generator. One strategy I like to use is create a function that returns the next value, and a function that will renturn the value to follow *that* value, like so, let's say we wanted to do something useless like compute the fibonacci sequence: def fib_seq( v = (0, 1) ): nv = (v[1], v[0] + v[1]) def fibn(): return fib_seq( v=nv ) return v[0], fibn if __name__ == '__main__': fibi, fibn = fib_seq() for i in range(10): print( fibi ) fibi, fibn = fibn()

The generator simulates (that was my intention) a data stream from a remote server via (e.g.) a websocket. I want to mantain a local state and update it with the received events. I don't know how to apply the fibonacci example to that.
Thank you for taking the time to answer. The replace function was the key there. I probably should have mentioned the date information was irrelevant (I just pulled 2016 out of the air). However, This does look like something I will need to do later with this data that I didn't really consider until recently. That's awesome!
Great resource. Took a look at their Flask section. They seem to have links to some amazing blogs.
Yes, I am aware of this problem. It is especially bad since Microsoft has never bothered to implement support for embedded Edge. Chrome seems to be the only choice in the long run, even though it will add 30mb of overhead. 
I encourage you to give dynamic types a chance. I’ve worked for years in languages like C++ and C# and I don’t miss having to declare types or muck around with interfaces at all. Returning to types with TypeScript made me remember how much time is lost to just setting up types even with TypeScript’s excellent inference.
Oh okay! Glad to kinda help :p
I see. Any plan to push and pull data into online Excel directly?
That's the magic of using functions as first-class values. You can maintain your state in the function itself. The next function returned is the next state.
While not a blog, but a curated newsletter of consisting of interesting projects, modules, and blogs about how python works, pycoders weekly http://pycoders.com is the only newsletter I actually look forward to.
But I cannot make the service recursive if I want to run it for a long period of time. Python does not have tail call. ... that's what I understood from some readings.
Looks good. I'll give it a try.
Is there any way to pay the shipping if you are not from USA? Amazon prime still works right? 
There's nothing recursive about this technique.
Cool, I'll do that! Thanks! 
Wooo... sorry, I overlooked your code. I think I understand the point. Thanks!
I refactored the code to this nicer version. I have tested with insane ranges and it works pretty well: https://pyfiddle.io/fiddle/ad1862f8-351c-4ad6-8900-9794a768ebe4/ Thanks!
Yeah the ebook will do, thank you so much.

Peter Norvig's essays on python are probably the best, http://norvig.com/
I was looking into more domain specific, project oriented blogs . But this looks informative as well. I'll take a look.
thanks for info but if there is pure python solution i wont go for javascript if it aint necessary
don't know yet. what it needs to require python development?
I tried to clean them, guess I missed some hidden files xD I'll clean them. I can also Add a few screenshots!
Just add them to your git ignore? It seems your git ignore currently doesn't relate to this project
I like Dan Bader's blog on https://dbader.org and his YouTube Videos. His articles are about writing more pythonic code and presenting useful modules. He has recently released an awesome book which helped me learning Python specific stuff like generators and decorators.
Fair enough. It's a nice project, I was just referring to how you don't have to manually keep track of things you don't want added in. 
That's not how things work here. Python has a BDFL and not a committee. If the BDFL says no, it means no.
At least when your IDE goes crazy - you can still filter out pip freeze. Good points tho, I agree.
No logical 'and' between - rather ';' XD different statements
Let's say I want to write a transpiler, how is he going to stop me?
It happens. ^^ Looks like a great learning project, good job!
Really good links. Very helpful.
The blog seems to know what I want exactly. Thank you for the link. 
try Fiverr, make an account there and start off there (granted this is a reply to a 3 month old discussion but still)
Well, you asked why it doesn't have one and "the BDFL says no" is a perfectly good answer. If you're now saying it needs one, that's an entirely different question, which you've swapped out from under me. If you want one, go and make one.
There's no substitute for experience and investing time in learning something. As you build a project portfolio, things become easier over time because you start to have a platform where you can try out new ideas and tools to see how they make your life easier. For instance, I implement scientific models, and I have a pair of go-to projects that are simple enough to re-implement quickly with any new toolkit that comes down the line, yet are complex enough that they highlight the strengths and weaknesses of those toolkits. My favorite one is a ["superdroplet"-based simulation of rain formation](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/qj.441). I've re-implemented a complete version of this algorithm many times over, using all sorts of different approaches (e.g. accelerating with Cython, Numba, PyPy and NumPy) and programming languages (Python, something akin to pure-C, C++ [both more recent and older dialects, and leveraging STL or boost utilities], Fortran95/2008/2013/with coarrays, Julia, Chapel, and even JavaScript). Code a lot, read a lot of people's codes, and try out the cool ideas you see. That's all there is to it!
My point was that you tried to fix something being ugly and you decided bash was the way to reduce the amount of ugliness.
Thanks, these are very helpful suggestions. Appreciate your time in giving them and I'll definitely try to incorporate them. One request - can you share with me any repository that follows most of them? The template by Kenneth is helpful, but seems focused on setup.py. Would be nice to have a fully fleshed example repository as well.

This is not a help forum, and you shouldn't crosspost your questions anyway. Good luck!
Can you post the actual assignment text? You've worded this in a very confusing way, but perhaps the original is more clear?
I'm not sure about the content quality as my web dev skills are rather poor but I've found few useful tips on this [Django related blog](https://simpleisbetterthancomplex.com/).
It's done via the use of descriptors and meta-programming. As far as a pattern is concerned, are you talking about a design pattern? Couldn't say off the top of my head... seems to be doing something along the lines of delegating behavior.
Apologies! Do you know where the appropriate sub would be?
I guess Django is trying to force a type of static typing into Python. You can see something like this implemented in most Python ORM frameworks because you NEED static typing of sorts.
I don't have the actual text (it was an assessment on hackerrank). I just wanted to know how to do it for my own curiosity. Let me try to explain it better. So a sample input would be w = 6 and h = 6 (meaning we have a rectangle that is 6x6) and given pieces = [[(0,0),(1,0),(2,0),(3,0)], [(0,0),(1,0),(0,1),(1,1)], etc.] (if you played tetris you can probably come up with what the other pieces would be). In the example, it showed that the piece DO fit together, and that each piece had to be set a certain starting coordinate. For example, the first piece is set at (0, 0), the second piece is set at say (1, 0) and so on. The last piece, in the example I think it was the square piece was set at (4, 4). Therefore the program should return (4, 4). If the pieces do not fit in the rectangle, it should return -1. Does that make it more clear?
Hi there, from the /r/Python mods. We have removed this post as it is not suited to the /r/Python subreddit proper, however it should be very appropriate for our sister subreddit /r/LearnPython. We **highly encourage** you to re-submit your post over on there. The reason for the removal is that /r/Python is dedicated to discussion of Python news, projects, uses and debates. It is not designed to act as Q&amp;A or FAQ board. The regular community is not a fan of "how do I..." questions, so you will not get the best responses over here. On /r/LearnPython the community is actively expecting questions and are looking to help. You can expect far more understanding, encouraging and insightful responses over there. No matter what level of question you have, if you are looking for help with Python, you should get good answers.

You've got the right idea. For reference, this technique is usually called "trampolining". You get the benefits of recursion by putting the continuation responsibility on the caller. It works well to replace mutual recursion, too. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trampoline_(computing)

I alternate. Sometimes I know exactly what I want to implement/test, and use TDD. Other times I experiment and write tests after implementing. When you write tests is not important, as long as you write them. 
Why use this instead of ipython? 
Pyimagesearch is cool for image processing stuff like that. Keras blog also has some cool stuff but it's pretty small.

A test case that gets run before every commit is worth a thousand pages of documentation. Running the tests early and often gives you a bit of a safety net when you want to experiment. Having a test case as part of all bug fixes really helps nail down what behaviour is expected.
I wrote a CLI that handles base64 among other encodings. https://github.com/carlmjohnson/decoder-ring
The best thing to do would be to pass around a function - that's very easy, just treat the function as you would any other variable. You can define functions within other functions and return them. You *can*, but shouldn't, define a string and then execute it as if it were python code. Really, though, don't so that.
Finishing up stuff to get [flaskbb 2.0](https://github.com/sh4nks/flaskbb) out the door, stuff like porting things over to use pluggy hooks internally, refactoring a module so logic doesn't live in route handlers (limited to just auth for now), and handling release busy work (tracking issue, bumping versions, catching up on changelog, etc). 
Just because we're on the subject, I highly recommend disregarding the built-in `unittest` module in favour of `pytest`. Pytest is much more powerful (parameterised testing is a necessity, and composable fixtures are awesome). The benefit of the unittest way of doing things (which is also used by nose) is that it works just like sUnit did in the 70s. This is not a compelling argument.
This is my process as well. When I have very very strictly defined input/output, ideally something that doesn't involve interacting with third parties, I'll write tests that guarantee input is transformed correctly and that specific exceptions are raised when appropriate. As soon as I start hitting some API or interacting with another process, that pretty much all goes out the window. I implement first, because I've learned long ago that you generally cannot trust the documentation or the API. Someone is lying or mistaken about behavior and the only way to guarantee correctness is to experimentally verify.
&gt; In Python 2.x series, the GIL is released on a fixed time interval. In the Python 3.x series, its based on number of instructions executed. Do you have that flipped? I'm possibly misremembering but I could've sworn 2.x releases the GIL approximately every 100 bytecode instructions and 3.x is time based
In javacript, you can have surprising coercions between types, for example`{} + {}`. Python doesn't have this issue because coercions between types are specified at the type level rather than the interpreter shrugging at some nonsense and moving on. Now, I will give you that typescript will catch your nonsense at compile time (well, sometimes) and Python will readily run until it blows up.
Well, TDD is a useful approach in some contexts. No more, no less. Just view it as such and stay tuned to costs and benefits Benefits of TDD 1. You know that your tests work (they failed before they pass now) 2. You get to think about your API before implementing it ;-) 3. You are forced to make your code testable from the very start Costs of TDD 1. you are spending time on formal tests which might not be worth it (e.g. for throw away tools) . 2. It's common for apis to evolve quickly on early stages of development. Test-first then becomes a massive pain 
Pretty sure Google was a heavy python user before YouTube was even founded. IIRC their original spider was written in Python.
&gt; And no, the built in "type hints" don't count. Why not, that's what 90% of Typescript is anyways. Python's type annotations are better than Typescript's types because they're not erased at run time, though they're slated to exist in a degenerated form in the future which is still more useful than not existing at all. The other 10% of typescript is stuff like shims for supporting the broken and disjoint state of javascript interpreters. But since it's a superset of javascript, it still has to support silly things like `{} + {}`. &gt; It would be great to use a statically compiled language in the world of Python. &gt; TypeScript's approach would be perfect. Build type definitions for all your dependencies. Support strict mode or not, allowing you to buck the system if needed. You just described mypy, which is effectively Typescript for Python. &gt; Do Python debuggers support source maps? Probably not, considering there are no transpilers (that I'm aware of). There are transpilers, so to speak, but they're for things like [coconut](http://coconut-lang.org) or [hylang](http://docs.hylang.org/en/stable/).
Not to poopoo on your adventure, it's great to learn about stuff like this. But your quest would've been significantly shortened by running `from __future__ import barry_as_FLUFL` [You can read more about it here](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0401/)
I really enjoy Jeff Knupp's site.

If you have a 150 line function with comments separating the parts, doesn't that mean it should be separate functions?
Misread title as 'bugs'. May have been more enjoyable.
Dude, indents for code blocks? What were you smoking? I get it, you had used up all the usual pairings (), {}, and [], but I'm sure you could have found something. As it stands, every cut-and-paste is an adventure in re-formatting to preserve logic!
(Btw, The fanboyz don't like it when you say anything other than "Python ROKZ!!!" in comments. That explains the down-votes.) Sorry you feel that way. With practice, it really is the fastest way to get something prototyped, and I tend to use it all the time now. Since it's not type-safe and not compiled, I'd hesitate to use it for anything mission- or safety-critical, but I'd say that for a lot of other languages. Also, with few exceptions it's very readable, and that's a huge advantage in my day-to-day. Really, my biggest gripe with it is the indents-to-designate code blocks decision, the change from 2.x to 3.x incompatibility, and the damned fanboyz. (The last one can be ignored, but they do tend to eat bandwidth when you're trying to have discussions.) Otherwise it's a nice little language with a ton of tools, and it tends to work nearly everywhere. 
Will there ever be a version of python that compiles on-the-fly directly to assembler kinda like what V8 is to javascript?
Thanks for doing this All! I loved your automate with python book
And the point? 
Excellent idea! So it'll never happen.
I test early in the process and I often write tests before the code that would make those tests succeed as a way of validating I’m actually writing what I think I’m writing. I do not go through the academic motions of TDD. It’s about having confidence that your code works. Do what you need to do to prove to yourself that it works and that future changes won’t break things unexpectedly.
I would have thought the point was obvious; execution speed increase and direct leverage of CPU extensions for operations.

TDD doesn't work in the data science field. There you have to get the analytic logic working first, and then refine the prototype script to some acceptable software engineering standard, and then finally you write the tests. 
Thank you very much! 
I think you may be letting your own bias get in the way of an objective opinion of the language. Python is used for tons of large projects every day. Instagram, Dropbox, Reddit, YouTube are built on python. I personally work on large python projects for feature film every day. Unless you need explicit performance, where even c extensions won't cut it for whatever reason, nothing about python makes it unsuitable for large projects. It would come down to programmer preference and ecosystem choices. 
"pip install" should by entered into the command line, not fed into the python interpreter. 
You don't run pip from inside the interpreter. Run it from a regular command prompt
Amazing resource.
This is gold. Thanks a lot.
&gt; I think you may be letting your own bias get in the way of an objective opinion of the language. What in God's name would make you say that? Someone has a different opinion than you, must have some sort of bias? I could come back at you with big names for C#/Go/Java as well, so that is irrelevant. There are too many cons IMO to make me pick Python for a greenfield (GIL/performance/runtime errors/type system to name a few). There are many things that Python is amazing at though. Ecosystem/libraries, interfacing with C (easier than any language I've seen), prototyping speed. Anyways, I take offense to your accusation about bias.
The question I ask to people who pose this: &gt; Have you ever failed a build due to linting an inconsistent indentation level? Until people starting using `prettier` the answer was often yes.
Hi, I lead a data science team and typically evaluate folks for python competence. The language you are using is less important than the problems you are able to solve. Practice difficult problems (you can start with Cracking the Coding Interview). It doesn’t matter if you use F# or Brainfuck, ability to solve problems is precious. You will see when you practice. Sentiment analysis might be useful to you, but won’t differentiate you from others. We get about ~10 resumes per week and almost all of them have that on their resume. 
That would be sweet, but realistically such a thing would require a google or microsoft sized entity to do.
Real python blog is awesome as well.
Hey, Thanks for the reply; I most certainly intend to keep learning and coding. I like the idea of trying out an algorithm or a project using different tools to learn and find out their strengths and weaknesses. I will definitely keep this in mind and try this out as my proficiency in python programming increases.
I think you are looking for something that is described in detail here: https://www.labri.fr/perso/nrougier/from-python-to-numpy/#uniform-vectorization You can get an even faster speedup using the @stencil decorator and numba.See here: http://numba.pydata.org/numba-doc/dev/user/stencil.html Numba can be difficult to install but it works well with the anaconda distribution. 
Try using PokeApi instead of manually writing a list of Pokémon. That way you’ll also get the newer gens automatically.

[This] (https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/87jk3l/google_video_vs_youtube_c_vs_python/) is what I refer too. It was the C++ wielding "Google Video" team up against the much smaller, and more Dynamic independent YouTube Team using Python.
In python 2 print is a statement, in py3k print() is a function. So naturally, should there be `class Print()` in python 4?
One of the primary use cases used to be waiting for I/O. For example when you're waiting for a file to download you don't want your entire application to be blocked by that, so you put it in a thread and let that stew until the download is finished, while the rest of your application remains responsive. Async has kind of taken over for that purpose, though. 
I am not totally up on the JSON format,but can tell you what it looks like this loop is doing. The list,elements, is a list of dictionaries represented by the variable x. The strings ‘name’ and ‘vlan_id’ are the keys of the dictionary x and the values associated with each each key are called like so x[vlan_id] which is x[key]. The format function takes any given string and where {0}, {1},{2}, etc. are place holders for where the variables listed inside the function are placed. 
Rum or Scotch? I'm buying :-) 
Thanks this will help. I will submit questions to learnpython next time but thanks for the help, I realy appreciate it.
Elements is not a dictionary but a list of dictionaries. 
It's right here: https://pypy.org/
Thanks again ^_^
Sure, but that's not when Google started using Python. Google was heavily into Python from the 90s onward.
Maybe you have more than one Python installed?
Which forum post? Can you post a link to it?

Actually, I have installed Arcgis and this program have an included package of python2, but it's doesn't install like my Python3 (c:/user/myname/programs/local/...), it is on a diferent path on C. I did thinked it was the problem but I cant unistall the Python2 without uninstall Arcgis in embedded. 
If this is my case, how I can unistall a program (python2) that doesn't appear on my list of programs? Python3 actually appear to uninstall.
Hey I made the same project in school, 4 years ago :D I made that in Java and posted it here and on StackOverFlow. We were creating a Pokemon game in Java. I made the mistake of hardcoding everything: https://imgur.com/10EmP9D.png . Now I know that I shouldn't hardcode such data. You can try learning about JSON or XML files, or using an API like. If you know Dictionaries in Python, you already know JSON. They're pretty much the same. Start by shifting all your Pokemon information to a JSON file, like [ { "Id": 2, "Name": "Venosaur", "ParentID": 1 } ] Make a list of Dictionaries and read the data from that JSON file. Try it out with the first 16 or so Pokemon and read the file using the json package in Python.

Hi kurashu89, For now lupin is far to be as mature as Marshmallow but I see 2 features that kind of lacks in Marshmallow : - builtin [polymorphism support](https://github.com/holinnn/lupin#polymorphic-lists) (support multiple types in a list or single attribute) - [validators combination](https://github.com/holinnn/lupin/blob/develop/tests/lupin/test_validators_or_combination.py#L33) (combine valitors with `AND` or `OR` to make it easy to validate a document)

when you count passengers in an airplane, thats nearly full, which is in most cases to make money; you can count 299 people, or you can count 1 empty seat, and subtract 1 from the total number of seats... in a similar way, why not remove the cruft, of 'self' hell? compiler should have 'self' as the default, not the other way around... i'd love to see, if he had a good reason for this, or if anyone else knows. 
You must not be writing a lot of classes.
I am actually building something which partially overlaps. I imagine `JsonTree` and `JsonClass` objects. JsonTree accepts a source of json, and allows "learn" (for learning a path to something you search for): ```python jt = JsonTree("some.json") jt.learn("some_text") # returns: Path('/intents/[0]/examples/[1]/created', type=DateTime) ``` Then you can define your own class: ```python class MyObject(JsonClass): created = Path('/intents/[0]/examples/[1]/created', DateTime) updated = Path('/intents/[0]/examples/[2]/updated', DateTime) ``` Then to find one match: jt.find(MyObject) You could add throws on wrong types maybe in `Path`. But to me this seems really convenient. I also already add automatic `repr` to the JsonClass inherited classes. What do you think, between one person interested in parsing/validating JSON to another :-)? 
I would use sparse matrices. It is fast and supported and the matrices for your example at tiny: 3 diagonals with the size of your dimensions, one matrix per index. Essentially, (A*v)[i]=v[i+1]+v[i-1]-2*v[I] is a tridiagonal matrix with -2 on the main diagonal and 1 on the +1 and -1 diagonals.
Interesting! That's not actually how Django works, but maybe it could/should be?
By your definition of learning or knowing, one can never know anything.
Anyone who thinks that there can be any such thing as "the BEST programming language" without any qualification don't get out enough.

Also, for computational power, we have multiprocessing.
GIL is not held during IO which means you can *wait* for IO in parallel. For example, using [Flash](https://github.com/avamsi/Flash), I wait for about 800 IO operations at any given time while downloading something (8 connections from about 100 different *local* IP addresses). If you are looking at threads to boost performance, Python's answer is [multiprocessing](https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html).
Thanks for everyone's valuable comments!
Primarily working in Data Science here and have been using TDD in deployment of personal projects. Have watched a bunch of videos on YouTube and read some articles. Can anyone recommend any specific resources that go deeper into the theory and practice of TDD? Cheers
