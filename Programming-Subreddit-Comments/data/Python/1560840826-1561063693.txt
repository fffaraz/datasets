if you know the indexes of the columns you could try something like this but ive never used pandas &amp;#x200B; new\_column = \[\] for x, y in zip(df\[index\_col\_a\], df\[index\_col\_b\]): new\_column.append(x in y) &amp;#x200B; then add the new colum to to the dataframe
&gt; Does pytest-benchmark have all the functionalities of pytest? It's just a fixture. The functions of pytest remain unmolested. &gt; can I just use pytest-benchmark and have assert statements to test for both correctness and throughput at once? Doing that is [literally the pytest-benchmark examples in its readme](https://pytest-benchmark.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html). Do note, however, that pytest-benchmark only benches callables, and that it will make your tests slower. Though pb does includes flags to enable / disable benchmarking (as in, have the `benchmark()` function just run the callable once and not collect / report information, that way the test is just a test)
I want off mr mandelbrot's wild ride
Thanks. I have read the docs, but I wasn't exactly sure if the test performed are identical. do you have any idea about overhead of `pytest-benchmark`? The doc only mentions that GC and JIT adds unpredictable overhead, but doesn't say anything about regular usage -- i.e. not using GC or JIT.
&gt; do you have any idea about overhead of pytest-benchmark? Well getting reliable benchmarks means doing multiple runs of executing the function until some statistical threshold is passed. Going by the behaviour of [perf](https://pyperf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (and assuming pytest-benchmark does something similar) at the very least it's going to run the function-under-test 10x rather than once. And if the function is very fast, it's going to run it significantly more so it gets a useful timeslice (&gt;100ms scale)
This is what I wrote when I started to learn python. I may be a naive approach to the problem, but I've manager to do it without googling ;-) [https://github.com/StupidDuck/sudoku-resolver/blob/master/s.py](https://github.com/StupidDuck/sudoku-resolver/blob/master/s.py)
but they are the ones who made really big contributions to the python too :) twisted itself is the reason why the current company i work in has 5 developer on board:)
Have a look at this:[https://basketball-gm.com](https://basketball-gm.com) It's browser-based. The "About" section has a little bit about its implementation. Perhaps this can give you a feel for what you would want to do and what would be needed.

 I would recommend my own shader programs with pyglet :P &amp;#x200B; [https://github.com/neozhaoliang/pywonderland/tree/master/src/fractal3d](https://github.com/neozhaoliang/pywonderland/tree/master/src/fractal3d) &amp;#x200B; [https://github.com/neozhaoliang/pywonderland/blob/master/src/polytopes/run\_wythoff\_shader\_animation.py](https://github.com/neozhaoliang/pywonderland/blob/master/src/polytopes/run_wythoff_shader_animation.py) &amp;#x200B; [https://github.com/neozhaoliang/pywonderland/tree/master/src/mobius](https://github.com/neozhaoliang/pywonderland/tree/master/src/mobius) &amp;#x200B; But I don't think python is a serious tool for writing shader code. I would recommend three.js, [shadertoy.com](https://shadertoy.com) or fragmentarium.
mostly it's just OpenCV. I used it to detect the maze image with findContours, again findContours to extract the items in the map and then HoughLinesP to detect all the walls of the maze. At that point you can just turn the whole thing into a 2D array where 0 is a walkable spot and 1 is a wall and do whatever you want with it!
&gt; at the very least it's going to run the function-under-test 10x rather than once This could be problematic, as a single function call consumes a few gigabytes of GPU RAM, so having multiple concurrent runs could result in overconsumption of DRAM. If they are run in parallel, is there a way to make them run in serial?
I started using Python in March. I have never had a job related to programming but I'm gonna be looking for one soon! It took about a week and a half to finish And yes, I used quite a bit of code from the sudoku solver! At least the extracting of the maze is pretty similar
Spot on man. This is the plague of every technical forum out there it seems. Enjoyed this immensely.
I wouldn't expect them to be run in parallel (as it'd mean pytest-benchmark assumes FUTs are thread-safe which seems a bit much), but that's way beyond what I know of it, so I'd suggest going through the pytest-benchmark docs carefully, and possibly asking the maintainer for further information if necessary.
Thanks
I'd recommend you look into OpenCV and starting messing around with it and check out some tutorials and things like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhMXDqQHf9g&amp;list=PLQVvvaa0QuDeETZEOy4VdocT7TOjfSA8a&amp;index=6&amp;t=0s). The docs for OpenCV are really good too. Check out [findContours](https://docs.opencv.org/4.1.0/d4/d73/tutorial_py_contours_begin.html) to detect objects and [Hough Line Transform](https://docs.opencv.org/4.1.0/d9/db0/tutorial_hough_lines.html) to detect lines and also [Adaptive Thresholding](https://docs.opencv.org/4.1.0/d7/d4d/tutorial_py_thresholding.html)
thank you for the advice man ;)
I think if you change `width` for `height` on line 19 you'll get rid of the aspect ratio distortion.
Thank you ! -- if i could find flask (and Flask), maybe i can run this one. from flask import Flask, request, render_template app = Flask(__name__) https://github.com/auchenberg/AutoCheckIn/blob/master/old/flask.py ok, i found this, but i still need other modules.

One of the main design features of OpenGL is that you build all of your "vertex arrays" once. When your data in the associated "vertex buffers" changes, you can just "draw" the vertex arrays. In moderngl, every time you draw, you have to rebuild your vertex arrays. It's the same with all of the other similar OpenGL functions. This is especially bad in Python because building vertex arrays can be time-consuming if they are complicated. You don't want to be doing that every frame.

`lists` is a local variable to `s()`, so you can't just use it outside of the function. You're forgetting to assign what `s()` returns to a variable, it should be: my_list = s() print(my_list)
Step 1; Plan, plan, plan. You need to go into detail on how your league will work. How will it simulate the games? Just algorithms using probability, or will you make it more detailed. What factors will go into the game's outcome. Will these factors be changing throughout the game. Make sure, however, that you ONLY plan what actually matters. Once you've got all this, draw a diagram/flow chart of how your program will run. Move on to pseudo code. Then, you can begin coding. I'm a big fan of "debugging on the fly". I write code that I hope will work, then adjusting it until it does. This is well and good, especially for smalle projects, but on a larger one it could just make it overly complicated. Feel free to shoot me a PM for more help.
Do i assign it inside function or?
&gt;for item in lists\[:\]: lists\[l\].append(i) return lists break &amp;#x200B; For every item in lists you are returning lists? Does this look right to you? Create the list in the function append to it and return it outside the for loop.
Yes, by assigning it you call the function s() which returns the list into the variable you assigned it to. So afterwards the variable will have the list in it. The function itself does nothing if it's not called at least once. So even if it didn't return anything you'd have to call it outside the function code by it's name. s() If it does return something you want to put the function call as an assignment to a variable so the data which it returns are stored somewhere and not just thrown away. lists = s()
def s(): lists = \[\['a', 'b'\], \['c', 'd'\]\] print(lists) l = int(input('Type number of a list you want to add: ')) i = str(input('Type name of an item you want to add or q to quit: ')) for item in lists\[:\]: lists\[l\].append(i) return lists s() print(s())
Here's how it should be. `def s():` `lists = [['a','b'], ['c', 'd']]` `l = int(input('Type number: '))` `i = input('type name: ')` &amp;#x200B; `lists[l].append(i)` `return lists` &amp;#x200B; `if __name__ == '__main__':` `foo = s()` `print(foo)`
Now this is awesome
Here's how it should be (python3). You don't need the for loop for this. def s(): lists = [['a','b'], ['c', 'd']] l = int(input('Type number: ')) i = input('type name: ') lists[l].append(i) return lists if __name__ == '__main__': foo = s() print(foo)
Ended up going with Redis for Pub/Sub and queueing. Tacking on an HTTP API to my process was far more difficult. The only overhead I've encountered so far is having to design the message queue protocol. Other than that I hope this works out!
Thanks buddy, the book is great!!
You shouldn't iterate over something and modify it at the same time, I suspect that's what's causing the problem. (I don't think lists[:] is a genuine true copy of lists - its still linked) When you call the print, you're using the snapshot of the list as it is, not trying to return it out of the loop, which is probably where the interpreter gets confused between the returned lists and the lists that's used in the for loop. Also, there's a couple of problems with your loop; its only being run once, so its not a loop: as soon as you reach the break statement, you leave the loop. Also, 'item' is not being used in the loop at all, so may as well just be a counter or dummy variable. If you just want to add an item to a sub-list in lists, you don't need a for loop at all, just do it directly: lists[a].append(b). If you want to add b to all sub-lists in lists, then you can do it 2 ways: with a loop, or using a list comprehension: newlist = [] for count in lists: newlist.append( lists[count].append(b) ) lists = newlist #if you really need to or newlists = [a.append[b] for a in lists] If you need to access the counter and also the value of an element in lists at the same time, check out the enumerate() operator. In general, python has lots of memory, an list comprehensions are very fast, so building a new list from an existing list is perfectly fine. (you can then del the old list if memory is a concern. Also check out the map() operator. In your code, if I enter l as 2 or more, your code will break, as lists[2] doesn't exist. You'd probably want to check the bounds of the entered l before doing the operation. Also, 'lists' is not a good choice for a variable name: 'list' is a python keyword, so you are a one letter typo from breaking code badly! (or maybe quietly in an unintended manner, which is worse)

Lol, I was just making a runescape meme. But awesome project my dude, I used automate the boring stuff to create an app that scraped several different websites to compare cannabis strains and seed prices.
Background process is a rudimentary load balancing algorithm - yes, I can modify the code. I'm looking to start/stop/pause/resume/modify parameters - pretty much everything. These requests should result in asynchronous responses.
That's awesome buddy,sorry for not understanding the meme though
Mind sharing the source code?
First thing i thought of was RS too lol.
https://pythonhosted.org/bigfloat/ Big number arithmetic is essentially a way of storing arbitrarily precise numbers as arrays of data, so that the only bound is memory. I'd recommend you try it out, though it will probably hurt performance quite a bit and I'm not sure if it'll run on the GPU
Sure,Its Not much sophisticated as I read about pyautogui an hour ago,and l hardcoded a lot of pixel dimensions for 1280x720 res , so without any customisation it will only work with 1280x720 res: &amp;#x200B; def Click\_Bot(duration):#In seconds from PIL import Image import pyautogui import time &amp;#x200B; time.sleep(5)#Time to switch to [https://www.mouseaccuracy.com/game](https://www.mouseaccuracy.com/game) im = [Image.new](https://Image.new)('RGBA', (1280, 200), 'black')#A Black strip to cover the browser header im2= [Image.new](https://Image.new)('RGBA', (1280, 80), 'black')#A Black Strip to cover taskbar initial = time.time() while True: c\_break = False pic = pyautogui.screenshot() pic.paste(im,(0,0)) pic.paste(im2,(0,640)) x,y = pic.size for i in range(0,x,10):#Skip 10 pixels at each iter. if c\_break == True:break for j in range(200,y-80,10): r,g,b = pic.getpixel((i,j)) if (r in range(245,254)):#RED [pyautogui.click](https://pyautogui.click)(i,j) c\_break = True break if time.time()-initial&gt;duration:break
Sweet! Thank you!
How do you spot red dots? I get the clicking part, but you have to find where to click first.
take an image of the page, loop through the pixels and check if the color is red.
&gt; Not sure I agree on the batteries included being the attraction. You could take out a good chunk, and pip makes it easy to install what you need. Except for... - people in corporate and business environments who have to go through a long, strict approval process before installing and using new software; - learners in schools where access to PyPI may be blocked, or with overzealous school administrators who treat downloading software from the internet onto a school latopas a expellable offense; - the poor in developing countries where internet access is slow, unreliable and/or expensive; - anyone who doesn't want the hassle of dependency management, dealing with wheels and virtual environments etc, as u/freeflowfive described; - all of the thousands of people who find "just pip install" to be easier to say than to do, as demonstrated by the many questions on Stackoverflow, mailing lists, etc "why doesn't pip install work?" and the masses of bad advice "just do it as root".
You can fix the distortion by scaling the x axis by your aspect ratio, but other than that it looks good.
You already got an answer when you asked in /r/learnpython
In this particular case, the popups are not exactly red , there RGB values varies by 3-4 points around red so you can analyse the popups by cropping them and checking there exact pixel values and then writing the condition.
I'm sure there are more efficient ways of doing things, but what I came up with: &amp;#x200B; `import pandas as pd` `df = pd.DataFrame(data=[(2,[2,3,37]),(4,[3,7,18])], columns=["a","b"])` `c_data = []` `for row in df.itertuples():` `if row[1] in row[2]:` `c_data.append(row[1])` `else:` `c_data.append(None)` `df["c"] = c_data` &amp;#x200B; This is probably a bit on the wordy side, but hopefully understandable.
Haha I love this, did something similar for Human benchmark thing. I've uploaded the script to gist: [https://gist.github.com/dybdaltech/67ba3404ae3a66eca5c038e5cf052121](https://gist.github.com/dybdaltech/67ba3404ae3a66eca5c038e5cf052121)
I know, right? If anyone can teach you Python through a book format, it's Al Sweigart.
&gt; The feedback would be in relation to the effort involved in getting the projects "working fine". If it turns out to be trivial for all users We already know that this won't be trivial for all users, such as: - People in corporate and business environments who have to go through a long, strict approval process before installing and using new software. I've worked with corporate enterprises where it could take six months of elapsed time, and dozens of person-hours -- including the legal department going through the licenses with a fine tooth comb -- to get a single library approved. This is not unusual. - Learners in schools where access to PyPI may be blocked, or with overzealous school administrators with a poor grasp of the difference between FOSS and warez who are itching to expel anyone who downloads "pirated" software from the internet onto a school laptop. - The poor in developing countries where internet access is slow, unreliable and/or expensive. - Anyone who doesn't want the hassle of dependency management, dealing with wheels and virtual environments etc. There's an order of magnitude of difference in complexity between "you have Python installed? cool, just copy this script and it will Just Work" versus "you have Python installed? okay, now I just need to create a functioning wheel and put it on PyPI, then you can set up a virtual environment and install the wheel and then hopefully if all the stars aligned Just Right, it should maybe work". For all of the Python community's talk of being more inclusive, this meme about shifting the std lib to PyPI is about privileging the experienced, full-time Python developer's experience over community members who aren't experienced, full-time devs, or are, but work in restrictive environments where "just pip install" isn't an option.
Added this to handle NaNs: import pandas as pd import numpy as np df = pd.DataFrame(data=[(2,[2,3,37]),(4,[3,7,18]),(9, np.nan)], columns=["a","b"]) c_data = [] for row in df.itertuples(): if row[1] is np.nan or row[2] is np.nan: c_data.append(False) elif row[1] in row[2]: c_data.append(row[1]) else: c_data.append(np.nan) df["c"] = c_data
I see what you did there. And I approve.
You can use isin() to check if a value in one column is in another column. This is straight forward if you are checking same datatypes. With a list it doesn't work...at least I couldn't get it to cleanly pre-caffiene. &amp;#x200B; This does work but there is probably a better way to do it: &amp;#x200B; `import pandas as pd` &amp;#x200B; `data = {'A': [2,9],` `'B': [[2,6],[3,4]]` `}` `df = pd.DataFrame(data)` `# create C by iterating through values in col B.` `#[0] on end as it will check all columns` `df.loc[:,'C'] = df.B.apply(lambda x: df.A.isin(x))[0]` `df.head(2)`

For future reference you can use this site to format your code: http://wittman.org/projects/stackoverflowindentfourspaces/
Its understandable. Runescape is a very niche community
&gt; We already know that this won't be trivial for all users That's what we call a _Prior_.
Need to read comments from beginning to end... I'm fairly green myself, but I hope this makes sense: import pandas as pd import numpy as np #some test data, added a NaN case df = pd.DataFrame(data=[(2,[2,3,37]),(4,[3,7,18]),(9, np.nan)], columns=["a","b"]) #empty list too build a new column with the same shape as your existing dataframe c_data = [] #iterating over your dataframe row by row, with those rows as tuples for row in df.itertuples(): #check to see if either column a or b contains NaN values. Row[0] is your index, row[1] is column "a" and row[2] is column "b". if np.nan in (row[1], row[2]): c_data.append(False) #actual check to see if column "a" value is in column "b" elif row[1] in row[2]: c_data.append(True) else: c_data.append(False) #Adding the list as a new column in your dataframe df["c"] = c_data
Name= input(“enter your name: “) if name: “zack” print (“hello peasant, blah blah”) else: print(“hello” + name + “!” “Welcome to the program!”)
The print after else is on the line below indented
Wait, what? Really?
Do you still have the App? as an avid marijuana “enthusiast” I think this would be awesome!
Correct except last statement is on the indentation level of while loop and Thanks for the website as I was searching for something like that.
No, and won't be any time soon. Apple deprecated it on their systems, but it does not really matter, because they only supported a very old version of OpenGL anyway.
Right, because you're using it to break out of the while loop. Fixed.
Great job! :)
Ah that’s how some people on the leaderboard got 100ms reaction times.

Thank you, i saw a source code too.
Thanks for the responce
Just as a note, these kinds of questions should be asked in /r/learnpython. Anyway, to remove the '\*\*' column, you would use [drop()](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.drop.html). Like so: close_delta.drop(['**'], axis = 1, inplace=True) To add the "days" to the number, you'd use the [apply()](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.apply.html). This applies a function to each element of column. In our case, we specify a lambda function f, which converts the number of days to a string, and then adds " days" to the end. We then apply this lambda function to the columns "Starts In". Like so: f = lambda x: str(x) + " days" close_delta['Starts In'] = close_delta['Starts In'].apply(f) These need to be done last, just before sending the email, because after applying these steps, the values in "Starts In" will then be strings, so you cannot perform mathematical operations on them (i.e. finding only those that will start in the next week).
Hehe, the lowest legit one I've seen so far is 119ms, which was done by my cousin.

Hey man, thanks for sharing your stuff. It's cool! If you're looking for an auto code formatter, check out the python package "black". It's a very efficient, bare bones formatter, I love it.
Yes, there will be _some_ overhead. No, it's not going to matter.
Thanks but you're missing the thrust of my point. I'm saying the batteries aren't the reason for the popularity. It's that it's a language that continually matches your abilities as a programmer as you develop your skills.

Can you provide more insight? Thanks.
The overhead will come from every type object having to store references to its methods. It's not going to matter because if you're at a point where a few hundred bytes matters, Python is not a language you should be using.
assuming this is your frame: &amp;#x200B; . A B 1 7 \[1, 3, 4, 8\] 2 4 \[2, 4, 6, 8\] then &amp;#x200B; df\[df.apply(lambda x: x\['A'\] in x\['B'\], axis=1)\] &amp;#x200B; will return . A B 2 4 \[2, 4, 6, 8\]

Nice. I usually accomplish this by passing the working directory to the subprocess module calls. This could certainly make that cleaner. Looks like in 3.6+ it might even work with a `pathlib.Path` object.
If I have billions of objects, to deal with I could care about hundred of bytes by object. It is the distinction between fitting in the RAM and not fitting in the RAM. I am not sure you are right about each instance having to store references to methods. It is exactly that information I am looking for. If you have any pointer supporting you claim, I will be very thankful to you. Note that saying that because Python is not targeting high performance computing, so we should not care about memory footprint of objects is not really a pertinent remark. Knowing implementation details is relevant to understand.
Every _type object_ stores references to methods, not every _instance_.
Yea that seems a bit better since its only one line. Oh, if it's being deprecated I'm gonna switch. Yea I will really try to remember being careful with handling user input like that if the program is not just run locally. Heard countless applications which had problems with that. (also &lt;script&gt; etc) Cool, click seems good to know as well. Yea it is dead code. Functions for maintainability and extra logic seems like a good argument! Thanks again :)
Thanks! It should work with any pathlib, probably pathlib2 aswell. I use the standard one from python 3 in the tests
you can probably get away with zeroMQ or something like that, gist here; [https://gist.github.com/blakebjorn/aab2f989a7b68fa83410153181aabbac](https://gist.github.com/blakebjorn/aab2f989a7b68fa83410153181aabbac) &amp;#x200B; Basically you embed the worker code in your external process that will listen for external commands from the flask application. IIRC the 0MQ layer in that example is blocking, such that a 2nd user can't send messages until the worker has finished processing and replied to the first user (but this is likely what you want). You can use socketIO to communicate state changes to the front end, and if you utilize rooms then you can make it so all users can see data feeds in real time, and state changes pushed from one user are instantaneously visible to all other users viewing the front end. Flask-SocketIO forks the session upon connection so you can check user privileges when they connect to the websocket
This is what I understood as well. Do you have any reference in sources code or in docs to support that claim? I would like to be sure.
You can look at the definitions of [PyObject](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/structures.html#c.PyObject) and [PyTypeObject](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/type.html#c.PyTypeObject).
 Oh that’s cool :D I made something like that too with cv2 and pygui what packages did you use? Cause I’m pretty sure that cv2 wasn’t in automating boring stuff xD
&gt;The poor in developing countries where internet access is slow, unreliable and/or expensive. So let's fix it by making stdlib bloated and bigger to download. That will surely help
Thank you very much.
Thanks, much appreciated. As I say in the docs, I started creating this mainly for myself and packaged it up because I never created a Package. From there I thought others may find this useful too, so I added the documentation. I think the usage examples and code snippets are essential to have a good introduction into the concepts and you can modify everything from there When I use a module from this package I also start by copying the example so I do not need to learn the API
Anyone have experience putting something like this in a disconnected vm?
Sounds like a great approach! The gist is very helpful! Do you think 0MQ would be preferable to Redis? I would ideally like my external process not to have to 'listen' for messages, but simply pull off a queue on demand. Is ZeroMQ capable of this or do I need a memory cache capable of queueing?

1. Thanks, those seem like some simple changes that could improve a lot! I have a thought about the Earths movement. In the one year simulation, the Earth is moving at a steady pace along the X-axis. Is this not just a consequence of the system's conservation of momentum? At time = 0 the only momentum in the system is from the X velocity of the Moon giving the system total momentum (1082, 0) \* Moon\_mass. Since all the point-momentum of the moon cancels out during a full orbit the Earth must be moving to conserve the momentum. My guess would be that the whole system is moving with the velocity (1082, 0) \* Moon\_mass / ( Moon\_mass + Earth\_mass) ? I got very interested in this and decided to run an experiment simulation with two moons instead but so that their momentum cancels out. I worked!! :) [https://imgur.com/a/wc6dlmc](https://imgur.com/a/wc6dlmc) 2. Cool! I experimented with this a bit: [https://imgur.com/a/Hvx7lee](https://imgur.com/a/Hvx7lee) It was interesting to see how fast things went south with the day-long step, meanwhile, there was no huge difference on the minute or even hour step. 3. Ooh that's cool! It seems like good practice learning to see that kind of things. Heard that it is quite common for an interview and such as well. &amp;#x200B; Cool, I quite finished my course on Taylor Series and I'm guessing this is a somewhat related approach? Thanks again for the feedback! This really makes me appreciate physics even more :)
The sphere represents the surface according to the mean radius of Earth.
Not exactly what you mean, but eBPF ([bcc](https://github.com/iovisor/bcc)) makes it possible to use Python to easily hook into some kernel telemetry. Only mentioning because I've been working with it lately, and it's quite nice. Probably as close as it will ever get.
Trying to figure out how to find the volume of a scan that I have the json and obj points of. Help?

1. That's a clever trick! You can test whether it's resolving your hypothesis or solving a different problem by calculating how *much* drift you expect from initial conditions. Over the course of a year, how much should the Earth moon system have drifted given your calculated velocity? 2. Yep! That's the stability criterion! :) 3. Big O notation and scaling are very common in interviews, yes. If you're interested in computer science as a career, you will probably learn about them in class in more detail. 4. Yep it's related to Taylor series. And other infinite series as well. Any smooth (meaning infinitely differentiable) function can be represents as an infinite sum over orthogonal basis functions. (Orthogonal here means if you integrate over the product of two basis functions, it's nonzero only if those two functions are the same.) One example is a Taylor series. Another is a Fourier series. And there are other examples, such as Legendre and Chebyshev series. These infinite series show you all over numerical methods. I'm happy to help! :)
I use PyCharm. Even the community edition is very powerful. But it depends on what you are doing and what you are coming from. If you are switching from Matlab, for example, Spyder is a great tool. But it is not what you are looking for if you are trying to deliver code or working with web frameworks, etc. [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) has very good reviews, but I have never used it myself. I'm not sure about the limitations between the free/non-free versions, someone with experience may comment.
It's a completely different approach, you used keys as attributes (if you need to use keys as attributes I suggest you to use [addict](https://github.com/mewwts/addict)). - How can you check if 4 level nested key exists? With `python-benedict` you can do it in the pythonic way: ```python if 'a.b.c.d' in d: print('a.b.c.d found') ``` - How can you use a list of keys? With `python-benedict` you can use the keys list as key: ```python keys = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'] value = d[keys] ``` And as plus there are many shortcuts methods to retrieve values typed as needed, like: - `get_bool` - `get_decimal` - `get_email` - `get_float` - `get_int` - `get_phonenumber` ... and much more.
I'm about to experiment with a simple program to run on my Android phone and to query a spreadsheet as a learning activity, but I'm wondering if it's possible to incorporate voice commands. Any insight? It would be as follows: 1. The app is activated by a trigger word or phrase (like "OK Google" or "Hey Siri" works) 2. I issue a voice command 3. The app outputs information about a spreadsheet through the speakers via text to speech, and that information is based on the specific voice command For example, column A on the spreadsheet is for items in inventory in my store, and collum B is for their par levels. I would like to issue a voice command which causes the app to dictate the par level of a specific item in column A. Is that possible? Insight appreciate.
I would argue that not having a string but an object with understandable behavior (directly doing the check `d.a.b.c.d is not None`) is more pythonic.
Fucking legend lol
Yep
I love it except for its use of double quotes. But I can deal with that. Definitely recommend.
I will answer myself to start the conversation going... I am a physicist, working in optics, building microscopes. I have started with Python mainly because I was sick of seeing LabView "*code*" I was used to Matlab, but was never a heavy-programmer before I learned mostly by digging into code and trying to understand what it was doing. Some libraries such as [Lantz](https://github.com/lantzproject) where very helpful, but also following tutorials on (the completely unrelated) Django &amp; Flask frameworks. I regret not learning earlier how to structure projects and programming patterns. My [first programs](https://github.com/uetke/SmartScan) consumed a LOT of time, I really like their capabilities, but were impossible to expand/maintain.

Nice! I'm still reading the Python Crash Course and will go through ATBS afterwards.
I use PyCharm mostly. Sometimes VS Code or Notepad++ also.
I am a Psychologist, but spent 7 years in the startup world coding apps. I'm rather keen on django. I've several such apps for running online studies. I'm currently enjoying using computer vision in my research via raspberry pi. I should probably start using Psychopy for lab based studies. I wish I'd learnt about TDD when I first started out! I'm self taught and suspect I would have benefitted from doing several courses as I've progressed in programming.
&gt; i use it at work, and the changes don't improve major flaws Which are the major flaws? &gt; but PHP is not very discoverable due to the lack of namespacing and/or OOP You serious??.. 😶 Which version of PHP are you using at work?
I dont know If this counts because im still learning and i'm not working as a Scientist yet. But i hope it gets some attention to this Post, because i'd like to see the answers myself. Im working on my Masters degree in biology but i only started learning Python (and programming itself) about a year ago. After some courses in bioinformatics i tried to learn some SQL and Java as well. In bioinformatics Python is used most of the time for analysing huge amounts of Data you get from your Experiments and to find significant differences between your samples. We also learned a bit about machine learning algorithms.
The source code is available for this project on github. It's written in javascript but you can at least take a peek under the hood to see how the simulation was implemented.

That seems like a stretch. I use twisted with python 3 and async/await, nothing 2-like about it.
Now that's pretty cool. I'm excited to see where that goes. Another thought: what would it take to implement a Python interpreter in baremetal x86 Assembly? Such that you'd be running it on BIOS or UEFI instead of an OS. I know that it's possible in principle.
I'm on chapter 11 of Python crash course which is the last chapter before I get into the three projects in the second half of the book and I'm just really excited to start building something instead of just writing random scripts for each lesson.
I do...
Atom
My friend loves it. I use Flask.
It is the case.
Vim with minor mods. set number, set ruler, syntax on. If you can do it in vim, you can do it anywhere. Really makes me feel like I know how to use the language without using auto complete as a crutch. One downside is that now every application that I type in, I try to hit escape, :x when I'm done.
Atom on my Windows box. NeoVim on my Linux box.
Nice work, in the future, don't do `if c_break == True`, skip the comparison to true and do `if c_break`

I tested my hypothesis. I did the simulation by saving the data from every plot from the 1-month simulation and then picking a plot as close as possible to a complete orbit ( Moon-X - 20000000m = Earth-X) [Image](https://imgur.com/a/3zee52H) Ideally, Moon-X = Earth-X, not sure how much this matter though. **Hypothetical calculation:** System initial X-momentum = 1082 \* 7.3 \* 10 \*\* 22 System total mass = 7.3 \* 10 \* 22 + 6 \* 10 \*\*24 System hypothetical X-Velocity: momentum/mass = (1082 \* 7.3 \* 10 \*\* 22) / (7.3 \* 10 \* 22 + 6 \* 10 \*\*24) = 13.16 m/s &amp;#x200B; **Simulation result:** Time: 60 \* 60 \* 10 \* 70 s System / Earth X-Distance: 32054384 m X-Velocity = Distance / Time = 12.72 m/s &amp;#x200B; **Result:** Difference 13.16m/s - 12.72m/s = 0.44m/s Simulation gives a 3.34% lower X-Velocity than predicted by the hypothesis ( 1- 12.72 / 13.16) I'm not sure what conclusions I can draw from the results. I would say the difference is quite small relative to the magnitude of some of the other data but it could still just be a random similarity. I definitely don't think the results can bust the hypothesis though since I'm quite sure the difference is in the margin of error for the simulation. I might have to do a more ambitious simulation.

I heard about this on pythonbytes the other day but hadn't gotten round to reading/watching it yet. Kind of mind blowing and also pretty crazy how much sense it makes when you watch the visualisation.
We have a process at work (firm of chartered accountants) that happens once a quarter that takes around 3 hours to do manually. I've almost finished writing a script to complete the same task in 3 seconds. Not sure if I should tell my boss. I want to move into doing this kind of thing full time for my company so thinking this is a good time to start showing them what I can do.

Well i've never done any microsoft access if i'm completely honest but VBA is the way to go for anything MS Office based. I have however got some code that runs on receipt of emails in outlook, so what I would do is create a function in VBA in outlook that writes to an access DB and set a rule in outlook to run that code when an email was recieved with either a specific subject or from a specifc person. This link shows how to write to access from excel which seems pretty simple, https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15709156/vba-code-to-update-create-new-record-from-excel-to-access then you could adapt this code to scrape the data from the email and write it: Public Sub ShowMessage(Itm As Outlook.MailItem) debug.print(itm.body) End Sub
I think this is a super cool examination of interpretation. It may hold many implications... Mathematically speaking, Mercury's "cosmic-crow-flight" distance, on average, is shorter because of the min/max distances relative to the Earth. Also, as the video explains, there is a "time spent closest to earth," and assuming that the video's calculations are correct (I don't do enough maths, and I'm just rambling with a counter-interpretation), Mercury again wins in this battle. However, I believe, when people associate the "distance" of a planet, they infer that the definition relates to the orbital distance. If I looked at the min/max distances of just these three plants (Mercury, Venus, and Earth), Venus would crown itself both the king of most and least range throughout rotations. In that sense, it seems reasonable that Mercury would hold the lesser average in "crow-flies" distance. Bigger ramble: Assuming a future society had the means to cultivate or inhabit either planet, further calculations are needed to assess the gains of traveling to either one. Venus may require less energy/fuel/time to go to in a single shot, but mercury offers more instances for travel within its minimum range. I don't know, let me pass the question off to you- If we were to travel to other worlds, do you think this observation makes Mercury a better planet for exploration and development? I'd love to hear your thoughts in the comments down below.
I implemented it as fail-safe but forgot to remove it as the bot passed the hardest difficulty on that website and then left the code as it was, but you are right there is always room for improvement :)

Sorry bud, I didnt make the website, I just designed the bot to play it at superhuman speed.
ah...this makes a lot more sense. Cool nonetheless :)
You need to begin the path with '/' to indicate the absolute path. By starting a path with "Users" it's using a relative path so it's looking for a folder in the current directory named "Users".
My (US-based) company switched from perl to python about 5 years ago, and now our whole test ecosystem is python. The product itself is mostly C++ with python extensions. IMO python is a perfect language for test automation. Its strengths shine (simplicity, it's easy for QA folks with limited programming to work with occasionally, libraries for everything) and its weaknesses are irrelevant (mediocre performance, hard to deploy outside a development environment, UI programming is garbage).
If you don’t mind me asking how did you do it?
Just started a new role as a Systems Administrator, part of my training is getting familiar with Python. In addition to working through the CodeAcademy course (for Python 2.7, we have older stuff here) I am working on a script to parse data from the header of specific files in a folder. Ultimately this will land in a CSV but I'm doing this in baby steps. &amp;#x200B; I've got the script able to walk through the file tree and identifying the files I want. Now I'm struggling with getting that data from the header printed into the console.
put the slash back: '/Users/rodrigonader/Documents/filename.txt'
Not a game dev and might be banned from /r/python for saying this, so take what I say with as much salt and sugar as you need. You should consider learning C++ or C# once you've familiarized yourself with the basic concepts of programming in Python. Imo, it'll be more beneficial learning C++ or C# over GML because the first two are more general. You'll still be able to use it in a field that isn't in game dev if you decided game dev isn't for you. &gt; How much of the book should i do if i'm planning on becoming a game dev? As much as you need to get your code/game to work. Going through a whole book doesn't make you a good coder, but practice and experience do. As long as you understand the findamentals, don't worry about memorizing everything in the book. You'll find that even very good coders go back to the documentation or read stack overflow to get help on something they have forgotten or need help on.
But starting with '/' does not find a path outside of the project's path as well.
My recommendation to be sure is to use your Terminal and navigate to the folder containing the file that you want. Once there, use the command \`pwd\` to print the absolute path to the folder you are in and use that plus the name of the file.
it worked! Sorry I had tried everything BUT a slash before 'Users' lol. Thank you. I'll delete the post since apparently it's in the wrong community (should be in learnpython).
I agree, but it's hard to argue against the fact that you'll always spend more time escaping single quotes. Hell, I used one typing this sentence.
I don't care about that, the shift key slows me down.
Thanks. Didn't observe it.
I use to use python for a couple of things. Could have probably written in SQL as well but it was easier at the time to write in python &amp;#x200B; 1)QA my teams database development by using python to connect to the database, run SQL &amp; test certain business logic such as the cardinality of the sales:customer table. Ensure no nulls, ensure categorical data only has expected values. I've since found great expectations library via this subedit which cuts down on the amount of code I write. 2) Complete pre/post deployment smoke tests on the database to ensure no tables got deactivated / record counts didn't change when we didn't expect them to.
you're welcome!
That's quite doable, I would assume. Essentially, the end result is to get the YouTube links so you can download them, or visit the sites. This is how I'd do it. If I have time today, I'll make code to go along with it. But this is the process you might be looking at. &amp;#x200B; Essentially, the following code gets the HTML from a website: &amp;#x200B; `import requests` `Site = requests.get("`[`youtube.com/watch?v=videoYouWant`](https://youtube.com/videoYouWant)`").text` &amp;#x200B; From there, you need to do a bit of sleuthing. Visit the site in a browser, and inspect the element with the playlist in it. It would seem that all of the video suggestions are neatly in a div element like this: &amp;#x200B; &lt;div id="items" class="style-scope ytd-watch-next-secondary-results-renderer"&gt;&lt;ytd-compact-autoplay-renderer class="style-scope ytd-watch-next-secondary-results-renderer" queue-is-empty\_=""&gt; &amp;#x200B; I only tried it on one video, and this could change at the whims of those at Google, who write the site. But it should work. &amp;#x200B; You're looking for a way to uniquely identify it from any other suggested video there. The identification method I'd use is to take the second element in it (index 1, just to be clear), or if you wanted, go through every video. The first element is usually autoplay, and the second is the playlist for any music video. But regardless, the tell that I'm seeing that a link goes to a playlist is when the link has two get variables, with the second one being start\_radio=1. If you're unfamiliar with what this means, just know that as you're parsing the links, know that the links you care about are going to have an ampersand (&amp;) in them. &amp;#x200B; From there, you have the link to a new YouTube page. You parse it the same at first, finding the suggested videos, which are going to look slightly different this time. Now, however, you just care about getting all of the links in the video suggestions. So parse through them, adding them to a list, and then you have the list of links you want. &amp;#x200B; What you do from here depends on what you want to do with them. You can just download the audio using the following [advice](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30560203/make-a-request-to-download-a-video-in-python). Then you could play all of the downloaded files with PyAudio (another python module) if you want, which I would recommend if you don't have a preference for how it happens. &amp;#x200B; For advice on parsing, remember the string attribute split. &amp;#x200B; Good luck.
I'm experimenting with \[Processing.py\]([https://py.processing.org/](https://py.processing.org/)) just for fun, nothing serious.
Wow, lobbies. I havent heard or seen that word for a loooong time.
Head first python is also a good book.
Thank you! I'll keep it in mind 😊
Thank you for your answer! Really appreciated. Since i'm doing game dev as a passion hobby, i'm not concerned with getting a job(horray) I'm actually an artist. i definitely plan on learning c# eventually though, if gm2 doesn't suffice when i'm more adept. Its just that, it'll allow me to get into game making sooner than later, so gml seemed the best answer for me at the moment. \-- The second part of your answer is very interesting, i'll keep it in mind. Im just trying my best atm to not give up on things and end up not learning important stuff
Here in Sweden in the companies that I have worked for the QA organizations have been using mainly Python.
That's very interesting! Do you have any examples of your Django-based studies? TDD is nice, but not a good approach in every scenario. For Django-based solutions, you have plenty of tools built-in, but for data analysis or instrumentation sometimes is more cumbersome.
1. Be smart 2. Don't be stupid /s &gt; How do I prepare, so that I can ace any coding challenge given to me during interviews There's no guarantee you'll ace every coding challenge. The best you can do is to at least have the codings skills approriate to the role you're applying for. If it's more of a problem solving challenge that happens to require coding, break down the problem into smaller chunks that are simpler to solve. Then work your way up.
That is great! Are you aware of [Python for Biologists](https://pythonforbiologists.com/)?
I am now, thank you very much! Most of the time i'm doing exercises on [rosalind.info](http://rosalind.info/problems/locations/) or i try to automate stuff from my everyday live. At the Moment i'm trying to fill an Excel File with Infos from the WoW API from battle.net which Kind of works, but i still have some problems with the authorisation via oauth2.

You may want to migrate them so it's not a nightmare later when no one knows how to do it anymore and you really really need to. (At first, I was just going to say: "that's horrific".)
I'm still working on a Sudoku Generator that I started last week. This is something that I'm trying to do without help if possible, and honestly, it's not the Python code that's hard, it's just the algorithm of making a perfect grid. Each attempt that I've tried seems to wind up correcting infinitely. This current attempt, I'm diving into classes and making a Cell class, where I can "lock" a cell from getting corrected. I'm sure that I'm over complicating this and missing some simple things but oh well, I'm learning and getting practice.
First off: Python is amazing. It's quickly becoming the go-to scripting language for a ton of applications. It's the dominant option for machine learning and neural networks (props to C for underpinning the actual modules). I can go from a blank file to a simple web site, an interface for Linux shell interaction, or a network debugger in under an hour thanks to its ease of use. However... I'm not sure it will ever be a market force in UI or game development. Some very cool things are being done by the PyGame group, but unless you have years of Python experience and can honestly say that learning that API will be faster than starting from scratch in C or C++ then it may be worth using Python to gain familiarity with the basic concepts of OoP and then transferring that knowledge to the industry standard languages. C and C++ are difficult. There is no hand-holding. You can easily create memory leaks and other disruptions with some bad code. If you want to continue with Python, more power to you. If PyGame or some other OpenGL framework wants to gain critical mass and become the defacto gaming language it will need help from both seasoned and new coders.
UI could probably be handled with Tkinter, changing file's properties will be a bit harder, if you mentioned creation time, look here [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4996405/how-do-i-change-the-file-creation-date-of-a-windows-file-from-python](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4996405/how-do-i-change-the-file-creation-date-of-a-windows-file-from-python). Other properties are usually dependant on the type of file and the way to change them can also be system - dependant
/u/zeus5552 you could try using numpy. Convert the image to a 3D array of pixels, extract the red pixels and find the index of the maximum value: pix = numpy.array(pic) red_pix = pix[:, :, 0] i, j = numpy.argmax(red_pix, axis=1) pyautogui.click(i, j) This is not tested code but shouldn't be too far off from working (on my phone). Should be a lot faster I reckon.
I have been able to choose the language that I work with if not counting in a project years ago when I was using ALM and had to write tests on VBS. Nowadays I tend to use the most convenient language to the task and other people. Java or C# if working with backend devs, Python with Robot framework ( usually also gherkin test cases) if working close to business or product management, and at the moment as I work mostly with frontend devs &amp; junior qa engineers I have selected to use JavaScript with Cypress. It’s just so much nicer when I can share the code and don’t have to explain what the test code does. In my opinion it’s well worth of learning few languages.
Fun fact: when you use variables like “c_break == false”, in if statements those will read as booleans. So instead of writing “if c_break==True:”, you can just write “if c_break:”
I don't know what you have learned in your class but you should take the program one step at a time. 1. Take user input 2. Split the input (separated by a ' ') and plug it into a data structure (which is probably a list). 3. Go into each object in the list (list\[a\]\[b\]) and figure out how to separate each object in this list into letters. 4. Keep a counter of how many letters are in theSentence. &amp;#x200B; Google "automate the boring stuff" if you need another resource for Python.

I think it's more convenient to use ImageGrab.grab(*bbox*=(x1,y1,x2,y2)) rather than capturing the hole screen then hiding the browser header and the taskbar Here's my version of the code with 1920x1080 resolution: import pyautogui,time from PIL import ImageGrab pyautogui.FAILSAFE = True time.sleep(5) while True: screen = ImageGrab.grab(bbox=(0,215,1915,1029)) x,y = screen.size c_break = False for i in range (0,x,10): if c_break == True: break for j in range (0,y,10): r,g,b = screen.getpixel((i,j)) if r == 255: pyautogui.click(i,j+215) c_break = True break moving the mouse to the top left corner of the screen will stop the program when time is up.
I am one. &gt; I am interested in learning what do they do? I am a biomedical engineer studying hearing and vision. Right now I mostly use Python for data analysis but in my previous lab I also used it for creating visual stimuli for my experiments (a tool called psychopy designed for that task). &gt; How have they started with Python, and what motivated them? For my PhD thesis I was doing large scale neural modelling. We had a cluster, but not enough MATLAB licenses to make effective use of it. I needed to find an alternative. At the time the choices were mostly Python and Perl, and Python seemed more designed for scientists and engineers (this was before Python really took off for scientific usage). I haven't looked back, although I still have to use MATLAB extensively because that is what the labs I have been working in used. &gt; Did they have experience with other programming languages before? I had learned a little C and C++, MATLAB, and Labview (ignoring the TI basic I taught myself in high school). Most of my experience was with MATLAB. &gt; What resources did they use to learn? I learned based on a book, but I don't remember which one. &gt; What do they regret not learning earlier? A lot. Pandas, xarray, pypet, holoviews. These all came out after I had already developed workflows based on something else so I didn't have a chance to adopt them as early as I probably should have. There are a lot of great tools out there and learning all of them is difficult. I suspect I will be adding numba to that list next.
first learn html css and javascript then go to frontend frameworks , cause this frameworks are based on javascript to deal with DOM
This is impressive. I've been toiling away at the book for literally 4 years and the best I can do is some stupid random number guessing game on the command line. I feel like an idiot now. Thanks for posting this to remind me that I am not applying myself intelligently enough.
Something something look at /r/learnpython For the actual answer. "Get" will return the value from the dictionary for a given key if it exists, else it will return None (unless a default parameter is passed, in which case that would be returned). "Setdefault" will set a value in the dictionary if a value for that key doesn't already exist. In your example, using "get", umbrella doesn't exist in the dictionary, so it is using the default parameter you provided. Using "setdefault", the key doesn't exist in the dictionary, so it is setting the value in the dictionary and returning it. So the difference at the end is that using "setdefault" your dictionary now contains umbrella:1
Ahhh yeah kk got it oh BTW I was genuinely curious as I'm a beginner and am totally learning alot of these stuffs myself so I totally appreciate the clarification mate cheers :D
Gotta love Selenium, mate. I try to use it to automate stuff everytime it's possible
Quoting [the docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html) (emphasis mine): &gt; get(key[, default]): Return the value for key if key is in the dictionary, else default. If default is not given, it defaults to None, so that this method never raises a KeyError. &gt; setdefault(key[, default]): If key is in the dictionary, return its value. **If not, insert key with a value of default** and return default. default defaults to None. That is, `setdefault` modifies the dict, `get` does not. If you have more questions, please try r/learnpython
So 'get' method does not add a key : value pair but setdefault does. Is that it? Thanks.
Thanks for the complete answer! Your path is exactly what I was expecting. The 'not-enough-licenses' of Matlab is something I've heard over and over again. I didn't know about psychopy, I will explore it soon. And including numba to your toolkit can open up a lot of possibilities. What I've tried so far is very promising.
for starters, this belongs to r/learnpython. That said, what do you have problem with ?
&gt;If we were to travel to other worlds, do you think this observation makes Mercury a better planet for exploration and development? I'd love to hear your thoughts in the comments down below I think that would be a bad idea. The gravitational potential in the orbit of mercury is a lot more prominent than Venus. That's more important than distance economically speaking.
Make your game in whatever you want or know. Minecraft was written in Java and people would tell you that you’re doomed if you said you’d use Java.
For a dictionary object, `d`, the method `d.get(key, alternative)` will return `d[key]` if it exists, otherwise `alternative`. The method `d.setdefault(key, alternative)` will return `d[key]` if it exists, otherwise it will set the key to `alternative` *and* return the value. Ex. &gt;&gt;&gt; d = {1: 'abc'} &gt;&gt;&gt; d.get(2, 'def') 'def' &gt;&gt;&gt; d {1: 'abc'} &gt;&gt;&gt; d.setdefault(2, 'def') 'def' &gt;&gt;&gt; d {1: 'abc', 2: 'def'}

well it doesnt matter to me, r/Python mods might mind, idk. I meant to ask you what exactly do you have problems with ? Do you know how to read user input ? How to do a simple calculation ? How to print something back ? That's pretty much everything you need and all of those tasks are pretty simple, you should at least try to write something yourself
You can ffmpeg for that, perhaps with a wrapper like PyAV.
FYI Powershell can create a gui. Check out poshgui.com.
This is a really well done article, I learned a lot, thanks! The folks at /r/learnpython would probably benefit as well.

I am bit of a beginner and was hoping to learn along the way have just finished basic Machine learning and i don't completely get what you are saying ( although goggle search helped a bit) so if you could tell me where i can learn more about this or just point me at the general direction for that would be appreciated. Once again thanks
the name of the variable **forsøk** is not permitted in python. use **forsok** instead
Thank you... That seems a great presentation. I'll see the YouTube clip later. in order to get that to run, i had to get sat_utils, networkx, numpy, toolz, . . . Then finally i was defeated (in my quest) by : ImportError: cannot import name 'accumulate' from 'toolz' what would be great for Mr. Hettinger (or his assistant) is to give me a ZIP file containing all the modules that i would need. But again, if learning was so simple, easy, and pleasant, Nobody would pay money to go to college or to get training.
Cool to hear that a complete test strategy is based around python, even though the product itself is not written in python. Do you also write the unit tests in python? I agree as with you on the experience. I have no formal background in computer science but was able to pick up basic python relatively quick and was able to write a script (probably not very pythonic) that created some test data on demand.. I felt on top of the world after that.
In the future, you should try to paste the code in code block so that indentation is kept in place, which is kinda importnt in python, here is corrected code: her_name = 'Elizabeth Cowan'her_age = 26 her_height = 67.2 her_weight = 155 her_eyes = 'Brown' her_hair = 'Blue \ Purple' print(f"Bio about {her_name}.") print(f"She is {her_age} old.") print(f"{her_name} stands tall at {her_height}.") print(f"She's weighing {her_weight} lbs!") print(f"She has big {her_eyes} eyes with {her_hair} hair!") print(f"But {her_name} BMI is?") print("What is 67.2 / 39.37?", 67.2 / 39.37) height = 1.7068834137668276 weight = 70.29478458049887 print(f"{her_name} BMI is: ", round(weight / height * height), 2) print("." * 10) ther problem is that you never ask for any value in the code, you just hardcode everything, you should ask the user for his/hers name, age, height, weight ... Then you hardcoded values "67.2 / 39.37" into the printed string, you must use the variable so that when user input some other value, the printed value is changed too. last thing you do is that you convert height and weight and store them in new variables, which will not work if you let user input its own values, but you can do height = user_height / 39.37 and the same thing with similar value with the weight. to sum up, fix 2 things 1. ask user to input values 2. use those values and avoid hardcoding as much as possible, in idela case, there should be no name, no color, no number in the code, with the exception of the number which you need to divide height / weight with to get correct result
I tried it on the hardest difficulty (a shitton of tiny dots) for 30 seconds, but it wasn't quick enough. Also the skipping of 10 pixels made it miss some points and dialing it down to 1 pixel per iteration just made it way too slow. Therefore I tried to use multithreading, which made it even slower but hey! - now I know when to not use Threads in Python. Then I came upon a very helpful forum thread (heh), that suggested multiprocessing instead! And now it works great! Without your program I probably wouldn't have had the motivation to learn about that stuff, so thanks alot! &amp;#x200B; I split the screen into 4 equal areas and distributed them between 4 processes. The screen space and the duration of the processes are hard coded though. It's not pretty, but it works. &amp;#x200B; from PIL import Image import pyautogui import time from multiprocessing import Process pyautogui.FAILSAFE = True def clicker(startingPixel):#In seconds time.sleep(1)#Time to switch to https://www.mouseaccuracy.com/game initial = time.time() while True: c_break = False pic = pyautogui.screenshot() for i in range(startingPixel,startingPixel+480,1):#Skip 1 pixels at each iter. if c_break == True: break for j in range(170,1040,1): r,g,b = pic.getpixel((i,j)) if (r in range(245,254)):#RED pyautogui.click(i,j) c_break = True break if time.time() - initial &gt; 30: break if __name__ == "__main__": procs = [] proc1 = Process(target=clicker, args=(0,)) proc2 = Process(target=clicker, args=(480,)) proc3 = Process(target=clicker, args=(960,)) proc4 = Process(target=clicker, args=(1440,)) procs.append(proc1) procs.append(proc2) procs.append(proc3) procs.append(proc4) proc1.start() proc2.start() proc3.start() proc4.start() for proc in procs: proc.join()

completely out of topic # how do you make these codeblocks?
I am a little weary of learning new languages and diving into a new ecosystem as I feel I need to be really good in one in particular. I good have a go at a java selenium implementation I guess to showcase on my github. If you would have to choose between java and c# which one you recommend?
Awesome advice and approach, but my approach never scans all the pixels as it will quit searching once a red pixel is found and will update the screenshot and do it all over again,but I could try this but my concern being that if I keep the image static and scan all the pixels then the lower bubbles might fade away in that time, I am most probably wrong so I will try this for sure.Frankly I would have done more optimisation if the current code missed even a single bubble on insane difficulty but it didn't so I didn't have any motivation to improvise it.
Well there are a bit too many unknown for me to provide a concrete answer. How is the camera connected to your computer? What model? Which codecs and protocols does it support. Ffmpeg is a bit of a catch-all since it supports a wide number of protocols and most of the commonly used formats. Ffmpeg can be used to decode the stream and write the raw frames to stdout. You than can open ffmpegs output stream from python and read the raw frames into numpy or whatever.
python has a handful of libraries you can use for desktop GUI development, but I can't say I'm all that familiar with them, and my understanding is that they aren't widely used in general. &amp;#x200B; Javascript (and the related languages that compile into Javascript) are the only languages that run in a web browser, so you do need to know JS for web frontend. there's no getting around that. it's how the web works, in general.
Great advice , I learned about that now, but I wrote the code after just 1 hour into pyautogui and was just excited to do something,but if I do a partial grab then the resulting image would not be in the native resolution and it would be too much hassle to adjust the clicking coordinates according to that.
Updated it, I am aware of that it's just in my muscle memory :)
Once you are familiar with python you could give Godot a try for game development. GDScript is very similar to python and building something functional is a lot easier than something like Unity or Unreal. Plus it's open source!
To format code I always open vim, paste it on a buffer, select it and then press `&gt;` to add indentation
As I said before, I was only 1 hour into pyautogui and pillow so my code is not much sophisticated, and for me it worked with 100% efficiency on insane difficulty (720p res) so I didn't have any motivation to improvise it.Splitting into 4 parts and using multiprocessing is a very awesome approach though :)
Thanks a lot!. A piece of advice is to keep practicing because the adrenaline rush and sense of accomplishment you get once your program does what you set out to do is worth every trouble you face while writing it. For me it's specially when I manage to complete 3-4kyu katas on codewars.com.
I also implemented a similar idea , it scraped data from imdb and would tell if the two actor/actress/director/any notable crew has ever worked together and list it.
And his cats :)
Thanks :)
Four spaces before the code on each line. [Here](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/commenting) is a list of markup syntax.
i have found that cheatsheet, but i thought it would be uncomfortable to write 4 spaces for every line. i thought i was doing wrong. thanks anyways for the response
I believe tabs also work, although I cannot tab on a mobile device and am therefore confined to the dreaded four spaces every time I want to write a code block.
Which company?
PyCharm for sure.
Travelling to Venus takes a lot less energy. Because the orbit is a lot closer to earth (similar semi-major axes) the velocities are more similar and a spacecraft needs a lot less energy to get there. One does have to wait longer for a suitable geometry for a good transfer though (look for synodic period). Mercury and Venus also have very different conditions (atmosphere, temperatures) that might affect plans for development for than the needed energy to get there.
That's not really a problem , you just need to add the distance between the top left corner of the screen and top left corner of the resulting image to the y coordinate in the click method. In my case, as you see I added y1(215) to the 'j' in the click method and it's works flawlessly.
If you are contemplating this, just ditch powershell altogether and go for a full Python solution
I’m wrapping up some Coursera series on deep learning: TensorFlow, Keras, Torch, convolutional neural network, recurrent neural networks, etc. I studied this field years in the mid-00s, when it was still in its infancy. I found it to be interesting, but primitive. Impressions: * The field has *taken off* in the last seven years, with major developments happening every year. Really an exciting and intimidating time to be getting on board. * Deep learning can be powerful. It’s amazing that you can essentially throw a big mass of artificial neurons at a problem and have it learn very sophisticated pattern-based recognition. * Deep learning is witchcraft. The basics are easy to understand... below that, it seems like it’s largely guesswork and heuristics. That’s how we get great quotes like “pooling operations in neural networks are a mistake, and the fact that they work so well is a disaster” (by Geoffrey Hinton, one of the leaders in the field). * TensorFlow is a broken, flaming junk heap of an API. Nearly all of the TF code on the Internet is currently broken, as the latest version (2.0) introduced breaking changes and deprecated a ton of fundamental classes. Naming conventions suck. Error messages are opaque and difficult to debug. It’s awful. * Keras is nicer, but quite limited in its applications. Many of the more complex architectures that I’ve learned in the five-course Coursera sequence cannot be developed with Keras - it’s just not flexible enough. * Coursera is a really nice platform for learning. The lectures I’m taking, by [Andrew Ng](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Ng), strike a very good balance between substance and breadth. He covers a lot of low-level detail, but not an excessive amount, and always in the context of applicable knowledge. Coursera also has a number of other classes that I’m looking forward to trying. For actual reliable certification, it’s probably much less useful, since the quizzes are kind of a joke and the graded exercises are severely cookbook-like exercises. No substitute for an actual academic degree.
*GREAT SCOTT! I FORGOT THE CATS!!*
still the same problem. i got Pypy and still the same problem (both with the old and new versions). - i'm glad i got Pypy3 -- when i run my own code, it seems at least 4 times faster (than the regular Python3 -- the latest version, i think). - i'm VERY glad you showed me your code. -- ( it's very short, but obviously you didn't try to make it cryptic.) ____ Maybe within a week i'll have made progress in understanding its approach (algorithm), etc. Thanks again !
Seconded. This is exactly what I came here to say. Godot is an excellent choice. The native GDScript is very close to Python. If you have intensive stuff that needs high performance, you can write those bits in C#—but that's unlikely in a first game. Good luck! [https://godotengine.org/](https://godotengine.org/)
Unit tests for the system components are usually C++ (you have to be able to instantiate the classes, and you can't do it in python), but there is a "management layer" that is unit tested with python.

Building out a plugin toolset library for my companies (Iron)Python plugin integration. The core developers are not super comfortable with Python yet, and the base API and passed classes are kind of a mess. Current goal is to consolidate to a simple plugin interface which handles base setup and initialization, then combine the various C# methods and classes into a structured API. Going well so far, coherency of the system is night and day, prototyping new plugins and extensions is insanely simpler than before.
I had most success on upwork... On Freelancer I had no luck, fiverr is not bad choice too... 😊 Good luck with freelancing 👍
Really depends on the context. AI/ML for someone studying business analytics? Probably need just a minimum of stats and pretty much no linear algebra. For A CS student? They should probably have a course heavy in theory.

A 3% difference is believable and compatible with your hypothesis I think. There skills be small differences due to numerical error and they can grow with time. A higher order or symplectic integrator would reduce those differences.

Much the same way that Alice Springs is closest to all of Australia's beaches.

So...was anyone actually claiming that Venus was more often closer to earth than Mercury? I don't see what's particularly groundbreaking here.
You didn't list a single language. What you listed are JavaScript frameworks.

Didn’t know you could even do that with matplotlib. Very nice
The best way to reverse engineer a web page with dynamic content is to load the data in your browser with the developer tools installed and the network tab open. Listed there will be the requests, headers and contents that your browser sent and using that info you can recreate those requests in a program. BTW, this belongs on /r/learnpython.
This result follows directly from how orbits work. Yes, it's new, yes, nobody proved it before. But it is not 'interesting' or insightful, and doesn't reveal anything we don't already know.
I'm working on generating summaries of events from a collection of tweets. The attempt should be a complete disaster, but the kind of disaster it becomes should be informative. Hopefully I can build a template that it will auto-fill based off of the current collection of tweets. For example when it thinks there's a tornado it'll expand from the current explanation (where the bot thinks the tornado is) and add how serious and include any other useful information people include in tweets. One goal is making it a template that's independent of the event type, so it's the same design for tornado's as it is for tsunamis, the other is throwing out junk background noise tweets so those don't bias the summary.

I'm not missing the thrust of your point. I disagree with it. There are a bazillion languages that "continually matches your abilities as a programmer as you develop your skills", and none of them are as popular as Python. For nearly 30 years, nearly every single person who has said anything good about Python has said that "batteries included" was, if not *the* biggest selling point, at least *one* of the biggest selling points. Honestly: - Python isn't the fastest language; - or the most efficient; - or the smallest, easiest to learn language (especially not now, when the core language is much more complex than it was in the 1990s); - unlike nearly all of the other most popular languages (C, Java, Javascript, etc) there's no big corporations pushing it; - it is pretty readable, but not like [programming languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperTalk) based on [natural language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inform). What Python does have is this: when you're just getting started, and you need to do X, you can look in the std lib and 9 times out of 10 you will find something that does X with a relatively gentle learning curve that you can get started with straight away. You don't have to google the internet and be presented with 27 competing third-party libraries and no way to determine which is "better", or with one obvious third-party library that everyone uses but has a steep learning curve before you can do anything with it at all.
&gt; So let's fix it by making stdlib bloated and bigger to download. That will surely help Why would I need to download the stdlib when it is already installed on my PC, or on the Linux installation DVD which was copied and passed on to me? The universe doesn't begin and end with the internet.
Awesome, dude. Nice work!
I'd use pyodbc/sql alchemy to copy specific production data to QA. Then Pandas + great expectations for testing. Nothing fancy, it was low tech but it helped us build up a good regression test library and increase test coverage over time.
This is a [course](https://bcucomms.blob.core.windows.net/docs/module-specifications/cebe/ug/cmp6202-artificial-intelligence-and-machine-learning.pdf) being taught in a CS program. There's really only one Math course being taught prior to this, and it's in Discrete Math, which made me question its worth.
&gt; As a general rule, the best is not to monkey patch. Amen. Dependency Injection for the win. &gt; However, sometimes there can be a great benefit. For example, calculating Fast Fourier Transforms with numpy can be slower than with other implementations. Didnt know that. Nice.
Nobody is ever going to "need to" migrate them, which is the point. They are mature, stable applications with no security needs (they run only in-house with trusted users), they are complete and no new features will ever be required, there are either no bugs, or acceptable work-arounds for any bugs which might exist. Spending one minute to migrate them is a waste of time and money and is totally unnecessary when you have a VM capable of running Python 1.5 already spun up. Its not a sin to have a stable, working application that runs on an quote-unquote "obsolete" software stack. Software doesn't actually rot, not if the environment is stable.
Yes, I think i also should adjust the simulation time a bit. The right data was somewhere between frame 69 and 70 but I picked 70. Since the time between frames was 60 • 60 • 10 I sat the time to 60 • 60 • 10 • 70 but this is not right since time = 0 at frame 1. This means that the actual time for frame 70 is 60 • 60 • 10 • 69. This would result in the velocity 12.9m/s or 13.1 if i instead picked frame 69. This gets me really close. If I then would swap to a better method (like you suggested) the results would probably get even closer.

I got something working. Basically, save all of your YouTube links, separated by newlines, to a file, run this script, enter the name of the file you want to create (or use the default), and the path to the file you are entering your links into.

Did you watch the linked video? At [2:49](https://youtu.be/GDgbVIqGADQ?t=170) someone does in fact make that claim. At best the other sources shown at the start of the video are misleadingly worded, at worst they are down right incorrect. The Quora answer (right right, not the best source) states "Average distance between ... Earth and Venus is .28 AU" which is patently false, that's the minimum distance.

Does it work *outside* of jupyter notebooks? I've had that problem with some other visualisation libraries. Also, I'm never sure whether it's OK to call something a pure-python library if its dependencies are not pure-python.
Ok so this is exciting because it refutes some misinformed people on the internet
Nice! I just began reading the book a few days ago. Did you read/study anything else while going through ATBS, or did you focus solely on that? Also, did you have any prior Python/programming experience going into ATBS?

Hi there, from the /r/Python mods. We have removed this post as it is not suited to the /r/Python subreddit proper, however it should be very appropriate for our sister subreddit /r/LearnPython or for the r/Python discord: https://discord.gg/python. The reason for the removal is that /r/Python is dedicated to discussion of Python news, projects, uses and debates. It is not designed to act as Q&amp;A or FAQ board. The regular community is not a fan of "how do I..." questions, so you will not get the best responses over here. On /r/LearnPython the community and the r/Python discord are actively expecting questions and are looking to help. You can expect far more understanding, encouraging and insightful responses over there. **No matter what level of question you have, if you are looking for help with Python, you should get good answers**.

Neither Mercury nor Venus are in the direction we should be going. Our focus should be the planets and moons easiest to inhabit. That would be earths moon, Mars and Europa. Venus is way too hot to even consider in the short term. Beyond that exploration really needs significant advancements in propulsion. Some of that could happen real soon if we could get a little focus at NASA.
not important here:)
I love code bullet too, his videos are great.
Ok thank you ill let you know if this works
It really doesn’t matter as they are quite similar when doing selenium test automation. Java is bit more familiar to me but on the other hand Visual Studio is a great IDE. I could not believe how easy it was to make some integration testing with it. I would say that pick a language, learn page object pattern, and just start with it. Logical parts of the tests are pretty much same with every language. Just be sure to follow the best practices so the code will be easy to maintain.
I read only the book in a linear sequence,I do have a year worth of experience(very casual) in python, I worked as a freelancer on fiverr for paid projects and I have read a lot of other books,rn I am learning as many new modules as I can.

Will reply in a few hours with the repository link. It was originally done alongside a course assignment for a class in Numerical Astrodynamics, in a private repository.
Why would you assume that work was "groundbreaking"? I don't see that included anywhere in the article, video or even this reddit post? It's simply a scientist posting his proof... as stated in the title of this post.
&gt;Does it work outside of jupyter notebooks? Yes! It's built for use in standard Python - the Jupyter notebook compatibility is a bit of an "extra" &amp;#x200B; &gt;I'm never sure whether it's OK to call something a pure-python library if its dependencies are not pure-python. Fair point - I suppose we are proud that everything in PyVista is Python only which means installing is simple for all OS given the the non-Python dependencies, being VTK, have wheels for most OS.
&gt;Does it support buttons, sliders, puldowns, trees, and things like that? It could fairly easily - we haven't built these directly into the renderer (yet). &amp;#x200B; There are IPython widgets that can be used in Jupyter Notebooks: [https://docs.pyvista.org/tools/ipy\_tools.html](https://docs.pyvista.org/tools/ipy_tools.html)
Thanks. I'll be more careful to post at the right place next time.
In my case, I saw one video, creator of pyautogui and showed some cool stuff, then I tried to automate typing test ... Just like how you did .... Keep it up :)
I use ipyvolume which works well in jupyter notebooks but not in jupyter lab. Have you tested PyVista with jupyter lab?
Cool but how did you import the 3D image
&gt; Have you tested PyVista with jupyter lab? We haven't tested it with Jupyter lab yet - considering we use `panel` (https://github.com/pyviz/panel) for the notebook rendering and `panel` supports Jupyter lab, some cool features could be possible! Perhaps a feature request? :)
If you don't want anything too complex check out the flask mega tutorial or Corey Shafer's flask series on YouTube on how to implement it yourself.
You can reproduce the rendering in the GIF using this interactive notebook: https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/OpenGeoVis/omfvista-demo/master?filepath=notebooks%2FExample.ipynb In this case, I used an offshoot project called `omfvista` to load geoscientific datasets in the Open Mining Format. PyVista's example gallery has a lot more examples of how to load datasets from common formats like PLY, STL, VTK, and make datasets using NumPy arrays. https://docs.pyvista.org/examples/index.html#loading-and-creating-meshes PyVista's goal is to make the process of creating spatial datasets and integrated scenes like that simple and fluid for new users. Try it out and let us know if you have questions!
Thank you! I am right now trying to figure out what direction I wanna go in, but I am only familliar with python so I might learn javascript first.
&gt;I am right now trying to figure out what direction I wanna go in, but I am only familliar with python so I might learn javascript first. Perhaps PyVista would be a good fit for you then - using it is Python-only, no need for knowing Javascript :)
Yeah it does seem pretty usefull
Yeah, I also used to use Sublime, if you figure out a way to do it great! But I prefer Atom ([atom.io](https://atom.io)) its really Awesome Editor and it can run basically every type of Programming Language there is. You can also, very easily, install packages and a cool feature is that you can code with several people on one script (file) from almost anywhere. Once you install Atom (which is also Free, and comes with all features no additional charge) you can go to "Install a Package" then look up "Platformio-Ide-Terminal" which lets you run the Python Script (with functions like input()) So if you ask me, scratch Sublime, its dumb and install Atom instead, easy, simple, awesome
Having "acceptable" workarounds to do, having to manage a VM with python 1.5 and having to have the knowledge about all this specific way to do thing cost money too. (Even if the "environment is stable" happen to be true, which is not always the case. And is never the case long term: people quit or retire)
1: I don't understand what that meant(still at intermediate) 2. It was meant to be a joke as in 'imagine if in their presentation, it crashed and said invalid syntax
That looks cool. If anyone is interested, I have [Snake Game Tutorial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP7KMlbvtOo&amp;list=PLlEgNdBJEO-n8k9SR49AshB9j7b5Iw7hZ) I made for my students. It uses the turtle module for graphics. I hope someone finds it helpful.
So couldn't you fix your own post?

The best and most efficient way to get data from dynamic JS heavy pages is to identify and query the APIs (usually JSON APIs) that the page is using to pull its data. It's way easier and failproof than using selenium.

Thank you for your guidance
You must not type very fast.
You're welcome - hope it helps!
Where is the paper? Why do these science bloggers never give the source? I went to the supposed main authours google scholar profile too. But this paper is not there. &amp;#x200B; It seems like that they used circular orbitals for the simulation. If that is the case it is totally wrong.
You have it wrong. *Because* I type fast, the millisecond it takes to press shift to type “ is irrelevant to me. You must time slow, if you want to avoid pressing Shift.l while typing.
So the planet closest to it's sun is also the closest planet to the every other planet in it's solar system by sheer average distance. This could be mostly true unless a couple of planets stays close and orbits their sun in exact same manner. Also the sun could be closest to it's all planets by sheer average distance.

We use python for some backed infrastructure and tools or scripts but the test framework we use is still good ol java.
They run in serial, although I'm not sure if there's a way to enable something to run the test cases in parallel.

Working on probably freeware that will likely get me sued. &amp;#x200B; Currently need a module/lib for monitoring sound.

Here’s my 2c’s... My credentials are 14 years experience in the game industry. First seven years as an artist. Second seven as a technical artist (hybrid artist/programmer). Firstly, I love Python. It’s direct and flexible. Building software with QT widgets is powerful and QML shows that it’s a language for the future. It is my language of choice. But... if you want to be a software engineer in the games industry, it won’t help you. You need to know C++ to a high standard. The entry standard is high because the queues to join games companies are very long. Because it’s a desirable sector, the games industry possibly yields the lowest remuneration in the entire field of software engineering. You can quadruple your earnings by working in FinTech. Software engineering is one of the best careers you can pick, but in games, not only will your wallet be exploited, crunch time will see you regularly commit to 60+ hour working weeks. If you still want to be a games coder, you need to pick a speciality. For example: - tools - graphics/engine - network - AI - physics - UI - backend My advice to you is to learn C++ and make a career out of it for sure, but if you’re passionate about games, play them in your spare time, because you won’t have any if you enter the games industry. BTW, I loved working in the games industry. The culture is great and the work is fulfilling, but I side-moved into tech and things are a lot better. Good luck!
Worth giving a try.
/r/learnpython read the sidebar didja even try googling "python onvif"?
Can you share course details
If I want to read kthw what will I learn? And the same question for standard library documentation
Oh this is dope, some time ago I was looking for exactly this. Only thing more I needed on that project was timeline support. I wanted to visualize a 3D scene that changes in time, and allows the user to manipulate a slider to move backwards and forwards. (Bonus points if I could generate and append new frames on the fly to watch a simulation as it renders.)
What does "SRS" stand for? And where did you get the words "product perspective" from?
Hey &amp;#x200B; Software requirement specification &amp;#x200B; [https://www.perforce.com/blog/alm/how-write-software-requirements-specification-srs-document](https://www.perforce.com/blog/alm/how-write-software-requirements-specification-srs-document)
Oh so they all run in serial? Great! Thanks
When I hear "Vista" I think of Windows...
Given how the media have taken to it, that's clearly the case, for PR if nothing else.
Well, obviously after I am asking here. I tried nmap and several other libraries. What I am asking is what is the best approach to go with this task and maybe if somebody already done simillar projects can say more.
Tests are run with `pytest` (`pytest-benchmark` is simply a command line interface to query past benchmark data, if you saved any). If you install the pytest-xdist plugin you can run stuff in parallel (eg: `pytest -n 2`) but that would create serious side-effects in tests that do benchmarks.
Advice for beginners: If you really really want a C-style for loop in Python, you can do this: ``` letters = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'] for i, value in enumerate(letters): print("{}: {}".format(i+1, value)) ``` This will give you "1: a, 2: b" and so on.
Don't even worry about it right now. You're not IBM.
Some files are included by default. See https://docs.python.org/3/distutils/sourcedist.html?highlight=standard%20files#specifying-the-files-to-distribute
ah ok, Thanks, just set some basic goals then?
What libraries are you referring to?
Yes.
You can also give MIguel Grinberg's [flask tutorial](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world) a shot. It's really good.
This is pretty cool. Thanks for sharing.
An SRS may be a bit much but you can benefit from writing down your goals and how you intend to structure your application. It can also be incredibly valuable to write out use cases. In their simplest form use cases are just an explanation of how each type of user is intended to use and interact with your program. I do think sitting down and writing out thoughts about your application is incredibly valuable and a skill people should develop.
You are comparing string (returned by `input()`) with a tuple of integers. Convert user input to integers, then use ` X in Y` as a conditional expression to check if entered number is in the tuple.
Taking a data science course that uses Jupyter Notebooks, didn't realize Jupyter Lab was a thing, good to know!
Thanks, that explains it. I'm currently using `pytest` but the docs say that they'll come up with their own in future to run these tests. So, `pytest` is going to be obsolete?
Give a link. It's not clear what you mean.
No
Ah ... finally, a refreshing perspective from someone starting out. You are well on your way to realizing that programming is not identical to software engineering. In fact, programming is only a small part of SE; around 10%. A product perspective keeps your focus on what the user of the product wants, not on what you want to put into the software just because it is fun to program. Such fun things introduce bugs in the software that may expend lots of resources to fix before the software is allowed to leave the factory. Schedule impacts may be disastrous. A software requirement specification is an agreed upon document that focuses your attention on what this block of software needs to do to meet the users desires. The user may be you, in which case a simple list of requirements is all you need, to a complex military application in which simplicity, robustness, failsafe, and safety are major items in a list of requirements that is thousands of lines long. This is especially important in applications that require hundreds of programmers to put the software together.
The environment *is* stable, because it is set up as a VM which never, ever, ever changes. The VM does *nothing* but act as a host for Python 1.5, which does *nothing* but run the application. There's nothing to manage except for launching the VM, which is automatically done. Any sys admin that knows how to manage a VM (I think they use VMware, but I'm not sure) can trouble-shoot any vanishingly rare troubles with the VM. That normally means restarting the VM. If somebody buggers up the VM (how?) the solution is simple: restore the VM image file from backup. But whatever it takes, that's just normal operating expenses, no different from changing the toner in the office printer or adding a new user account. It is already budgeted for and paid for. Its what the sys admins are already there for. And it frees the developers to work on other applications which are either being actively developed or can bring money in. These applications aren't like that: there is **zero** development, and they are legacy applications only used in-house. If they were being actively developed, then I would agree that it was *long* past time they should have upgraded. But they aren't. As for your comment: &gt; having to have the knowledge about all this specific way to do thing cost money too. Their user instructions are something like this: * Log into machine Foo; run application. The only thing this costs extra is "Log into machine Foo". The application-specific details would be the same whether it ran under Python 2 or Python 3 or Perl or Java. Updating the applications to Python 2 or 3 can only introduce new bugs and cost a lot of developer time that has to be budgeted for. There's no benefit to upgrading. Not everything has to run on the latest version. Legacy apps get the job done too.
Thanks :D, that makes sense , will try that!
I vote for Julia. :-p
thanks for the clarification. ha-ha so I've got a long way to go ;).

Just curious, what web app are you trying to build? How far along are you in learning Python?
**Python:** Go to https://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/, which should provide plenty of pointers to everything you need in order to get started. If you get stuck, /r/learnpython should be able to help. I won't remember any specific introductory book, because everyone's learning style is different, and I don't know enough about your background - I'd invest an hour or so investigating the options. **API:** this isn't really a technology in the strict sense; the acronym stands for "application programming interface", and really just means that a system has some sort of interface that applications can talk to in an automated fashion. On the web, it usually means "JSON over HTTP(S)" (often referred to as "REST", even though that is strictly speaking incorrect). Essentially, what you do is have your application send HTTP requests to the "API", with request data attached as either JSON request bodies, request parameters, or both; and then you get JSON objects back, typically in the response body. The exact format of the data to send and receive, as well as URL paths and all that, differ between APIs. Magic keywords to google include JSON, HTTP, REST / RESTful, AJAX. It also helps to look at a specific API and see if you can make sense of it just by manually talking to it (using your web browser, or, for more advanced stuff, something like `curl`). **git:** The best resource on this topic would be [the git book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2). You don't have to study the entire book; just the first 3 chapters will give you everything you need for day-to-day work, and then you can read the rest as the need arises.
How familiar are you with progamming concepts in general? Also, do you have a rough idea on the things you need to do? If you have a basic understanding of programming concepts, I'll say 2 weeks I doable. There are some courses on Udemy that teaches both Python and how use basic Git commands. As long as you put in an hour or two a day, you'll be fine. In regards to APIs, will you just be making API calls or will you need to build the APIs?
Yeah, I'm pretty sure that's a photograph. This is just how Guido walks around.
Talking about this (in the same link you provided - Section 4.1): &gt; anything that looks like a test script: test/test*.py (**currently, the Distutils don’t do anything with test scripts except include them in source distributions, but in the future there will be a standard for testing Python module distributions**)
Am I the only one kinda bummed that this wasn't Guido painting and Bob Rossing it up at a conference. Edit: now that I said "Guido Bob Rossing it up" all I can think is: &gt; Conference goer: Why is there &lt;quirky language feature&gt; in Python? Was it a mistake? &gt; Guido: There are no mistakes. Just happy accidents.
Hey &amp;#x200B; An industry specific app and haven't seen it out in the wild only 1 company has a similar idea that's in house only . As far as my research goes. &amp;#x200B; I would say very rudimentary trying to cram , Python,Django HTML,CSS Javscript to a get POC up.
&gt; they used circular orbitals for the simulation. If that is the case it is totally wrong. *Totally* wrong? Given that Venus, Earth and Mars have fairly small orbital eccentricities, and even Mercury's eccentricity is moderate, I think the onus is on you to prove that the results are invalidated by any (small?) adjustment needed to account for the (not quite) elliptical orbits.
I have a decent understanding of how programming works through my education. I've study VB, C++, Bash scripting, etc. while I was in college but that was a while ago. I believe that I'll be working with python and API calls

That's not a good idea. You should use a tool like Pipenv or Poetry instead - they will handle all the busywork of creating a virtual environment for you.

I would say 0MQ is preferable here - if you absolutely know there will be more stuff added to this functionality wise you may be future proofing with an external keystore, but as it stands I don't think its needed unless you expect massive concurrency and foresee a need for horizontal scaling. You can just call socket.poll(0) and it will return whatever is sitting on top of the queue without delay. The extent of the 0MQ implementation was in the gist, whereas the redis/rabbitMQ implementation involves installing external dependencies and a 3rd program to act as an intermediary between the front and back end
Wow. There's a lot to learn. Like what the others said, writing an SRS right now will just be a distraction. List down all the top 10 features you'd like your app to have and rank them. Focus on the top feature and strike out the other 9. As a beginner, your focus should be on **writing** **clean readable code** that works. &amp;#x200B; Without knowing the scope of your project, I can't comment on whether it'll be too much for a beginner to handle alone. Every so often, this subreddit gets questions from total beginners wanting to build the next Patreon or Facebook all by themselves. Hope this helps even just a bit. Good luck!
I'd recommend Poetry. It's fairly simple to use and makes sure you have the correct dependencies.

There are probably a few out there. Not that I know of any. I personally prefer to just work on personal projects to get hands-on experience.
Django will get you set up very quickly. The inbuilt orm with postgresql took me a couple of minutes with zero SQL experience, and the built-in admin means you can start adding inventory items as soon as you have your first model, with different levels of authorisation. A rest API was easy to add too, if you plan to use react that way (once I got used to class based views). I eventually learned how to do all that with flask too, but it took a lot longer and more work to figure out how all the moving parts you add should interact. Either will do a great job, but I vote django if it's a first project and for a real job
Django just because they have admin page. And Django-Rest to create the Rest API.
Am I the only one not getting the symbolism? I could understand if it was a snake or a duck, but what is the meaning of the goat and rabbit?
Thanks for that :) appreciated. ha-ha defo not on that scale, but a not simple app either more niche but would have room to evolve.
Django has a greater community and therefore more information on how to use it. Also it will be easier to find answer to any situation you may face while developing. Flask is smaller, works fine, but it's harder to use and there's less support to it. So, for a professional job, use Django.
We won't be using the admin page as it doesn't fit our use case! But on the perspective of ease of delelopment and flexibility Is django is a good choice?
Python is currently more stable and easier to deal with than R.
Personally I find it marginally easier to to develop in Django than Flask just because I have more experience working in Django. There are also more resources and documentation out there for Django than for flask. What are you looking for in terms of flexibility? In general, Flask is "more" flexible than Django. But so far, I haven't encountered a situation where Django couldn't do what Flask could do.
Phil? Is that you?
I have written [a tutorial about working with cameras and displaying data](https://www.pythonforthelab.com/blog/step-by-step-guide-to-building-a-gui/) which may be a useful starting point for you. In the tutorial I go step-by-step on how to build a program that displays data from a webcam. It is built in such a way that you can easily expand it to do live data analysis, etc. Hope it helps!
Hey you beautiful bastard, love yo face, and I'll see you tomorrow
To be honest, that example on FFT is the only one that makes me be grateful for monkey-patching existing.
Yes you are right. They are close enough to be a circle. However there is no reason to approximate it to a circle in the simulation. I do not think any peer reviewed journal would accept that. It is a infinity small correction to there already existing model, any peer reviewer would ask them to correct that issue. Also that can be the reason for the difference of previous average distance calculations and new one. We cant tell, because the source is not available. I am seriously suspecting that this is just a class paper. Not a NASA is wrong and this is a breakthrough paper.
To each their own. Shift keys generally make me type two upper case letters in a row which means I have to go back and correct the mistake. The less shifting, the more productive I am. I'm also a vim user, you might not be.
I know about paraview. The long term goal is to replace the desktop app in browser.
Agreed.
1. /r/learnpython 2. You're dealing with floats, and floats are not that precise, especially as they get really big or really small. It seems to me you can avoid all of it by just using integer division: `n //= k`.
There aren’t any great advancements in propulsion coming down the pipe. Ion engines are efficient, but it took the ESA 6 months to get to the moon with their probe vs 3 days by conventional methods in the 1960s. Sure it’s cheaper, but to get to an outer planet is going to take a while. I’d support a trip to Venus. We’ve landed on it before.
Why cant casual game be fast ?
Do you have the python example? For whatever reason this is harder for me to visualize than moving the stack except largest ring, moving largest ring, moving stack on top of largest ring.
Make sense. There is ParaView Glance also : [https://kitware.github.io/paraview-glance/app/](https://kitware.github.io/paraview-glance/app/)
Does it? You’re not going to plan a mission based on it. It’s another useless fact to add to your trivia bag. It’s not even the right orbit.
Please choose django and not flask. Future developers coming to the project will thank you for this.
It’s Monty Python stuff right?
Django is great because it will get you PoC soon enough after creating models and registering them in admin page. I highly suggest doing the django tutorial to see how it feels. &amp;#x200B; But due ML thing, if you want framework that gives you more "freedom", maybe flask is not a bad choice either. You lose a lot of development time implementing "batteries" that are included in django.
I think the goat is referring to the testing goat
Does someone have this in JPG or png?
Please choose flask and not django. Future developers coming to the project will thank you for this. More seriously: don't over-think it. While I obviously have a fairly strong preference, choices like matter much less than, say, whether you do code review. As to my preferences: I _hate_ Django's ORM as compared to SQL Alchemy, and find its built-in admin somewhere between "not very helpful" and "a thing I'll have to tear out later" (in 2019. In 2009, it was much more of a mess to make an admin site from scratch). I find the provided authentication mechanism unpleasant, even if I can work around to make it sensible (and use emails like Goddess intended). Its encouragement for using .html as an extension for templates is a pain, and I just _really don't like_ text-replacement based templates at all. Finally, if you don't use the admin, and your application will be accessed exclusively through the API, than most benefits Django gives are discarded right there and then. Rest_framework is _fine_, though. Having said that, I worked on Flask and Django projects a lot. I'd personally start new projects with... well, uh, Go's net/http, but if Python, then Flask, but Django works and does what it's told to. I would not die on that hill, at least not unless one of the team mates said something douchey like "use django future developers will thank you for this." Local expertise and preferences of your team are more important. And if you're only one on the team, then you seem to have mentioned having Laravel and Express experience.
Is there anything inside table ?

Thanks im going to try it
Okay I'll check that out. Thanks!
Thanks, I'll take a look at it!
&gt;Yes! It's built for use in standard Python - the Jupyter notebook compatibility is a bit of an "extra" Great! I've struggled with mesh work in the past, will keep pyvista in mind next time I need to do some! &gt; I suppose we are proud that everything in PyVista is Python only which means installing is simple for all OS given the the non-Python dependencies, being VTK, have wheels for most OS. Yes, there definitely should be a way of specifying that *your* package is python-only, even if its dependencies aren't. It's a failure of language more than anything else!
Are you using flask 1.0.2 or 0.12.4? Recently, the 1.x.x versions have issues when combining blueprints with Flask-wtf and sql-alchemy. I'm stuck using flask 0.12.4 for now
That's not creepy at all.
0.12, unfortunately. I've moved to Go (and recently started _experimenting with_ Rust) for similar purposes, which, considering my previous choices, is probably very unsurprising. I actually never used flask-sqlalchemy though: I've found it easy enough to integrate it myself, and actually more comfortable that way once I started also using the same code in, say, Celery workers.
PyVista depends on the Visualization Toolkit (VTK) [https://vtk.org](https://vtk.org) which is a C++ library that has Python bindings. Every bit of code in PyVista is Python, but PyVista types inherit from VTK types so it has a bit of a C++ backend (which makes everything super fast)
\+1 to ParaView Glance and other "ParaViewWeb" tools: [https://www.paraview.org/web/](https://www.paraview.org/web/) as well as VTKjs: [https://kitware.github.io/vtk-js/index.html](https://kitware.github.io/vtk-js/index.html)
&gt; Only thing more I needed on that project was timeline support. I wanted to visualize a 3D scene that changes in time, and allows the user to manipulate a slider to move backwards and forwards. (Bonus points if I could generate and append new frames on the fly to watch a simulation as it renders.) This sounds like a cool feature request :) I'll see if I can post an issue on the repo
[😔](https://emojipedia.org/pensive-face/)
Yeah, I guess in the end we just need to use what is easy to understand to get the job done. Also, constant updates to software packages is my biggest nightmare. Also, what's Go primarily used for? I'm using flask for home automation right now.
Service-oriented web dev and tooling — very notably Kubernetes and most Hashicorp products, for example. It's "good enough" on the language front (though after Rust it's a bit hard to type "interface {}" ever again), has fantastic deployment story (especially for the tooling — you might not really care about installing the runtime for your web application, but if Nomad required installing a specific Python version...) and decent performance.
Im trying it and i downloaded and istalled the package but how do i run the code now? i used to save it then run the build with ctrl + s and ctrl + b in sublime, i dont find how to do it here
I guess I don't view it as such a big deal to see which libs on pypi are better than others. Of course, I have a different perspective from when I started with python, having preceded it with about 20 years of sys/network admin work. Being able to discern which packages are better than others is something I'm used to. That said, I think a curated list of the premier packages for certain situations would be a great idea. I wouldn't have found the Requests library so quickly if the guide I'd followed hadn't mentioned it. Which CRC lib is best? I don't know. I know one that I've gotten familiar with though. Is that best, or just good enough? I don't expect a CRC lib to be folded into stdlib (though it could make sense), and that would be incredibly appropriate for an offshoot like micropython as well, but not for IPython.
Reading is fun and all, but you should write some code.
It's either that or work test for the existence of the overlapping div and then don't try and click it Try except is very useful for selenium as it inevitably breaks sooner or later
I can't think of any way in which the Django ORM is as good as SQLAlchemy. And, if you use flask-sqlalchemy, it's just as easy to set up and get going. For me, using Django involves *a lot* of time digging through the docs and source code to discover the *Django* way of doing whatever (usually relatively straightforward) thing I need to do: with a single magical line of code. I'm very skeptical when people sell Django as being *quick* or *easy*.
I mean, I have one use case where I would willingly use Django, and that's literally because in that case it's "quick": if it's a CMS-like project that I will most likely spend a day or two on. Then, the admin saves me a third day, and I'm unlikely to hit any of the annoyances that the ORM causes. It does mean that my experience is opposite to the common one: I pick "batteries included" frameworks for small projects where picking batteries would constitute a large chunk of the total work spent.
Anyone know the artist?
Yeah when I was writing READ I also meant practice
Ah nice, I'll contribute some comments at the very least.

Landed is an interesting accomplishment but how long did that landed last and how useful was any data recurved? As for near term propulsion solutions I was think more about the various nuclear options some of which could be online relatively quickly. By the way one of the reasons better power plants are needed in my opinion is that we need much larger ships to make these longer journeys! I’m not expecting huge increases in travel velocity though some improvements will happen.
&gt; Yes you are right. They are close enough to be a circle. However there is no reason to approximate it to a circle in the simulation. "No reason"? You're a mathematician or physicist who is qualified to make such a claim because you know how to calculate the average distance apart of two orbital bodies in elliptical orbits at slightly different angles in three dimensional space? &gt; I do not think any peer reviewed journal would accept that. The article has [a link to the original](https://physicstoday.scitation.org/do/10.1063/PT.6.3.20190312a/full/), in Physics Today, where the method is explained, and its accuracy (within 1%) compared to the usual alternative method (which is wrong by up to 300%). &gt; I am seriously suspecting that this is just a class paper. Not a NASA is wrong and this is a breakthrough paper. NASA isn't wrong -- they've succeeded in getting space probes to both Mercury and Venus, and perfectly well know how to calculate the distances between them at any moment of the day, complete with relativistic corrections in the case of Mercury should they be required. But the PR bod working for NASA who write the sentence describing Venus as "our closest planetary neighbor" is only correct in the sense of *which planet has the nearest approach to Earth", a very misleading sense since Venus is only the closest planet to Earth for some small fraction of the time, when both planets are on the same side of the Sun, and not even always then. By the way: one of the co-authors is an engineer at NASA, and another NASA scientist validated their results. To put it simply: while it is true that *sometimes* Venus is closer to Earth than Mercury is, for the most part Venus is on the other side of the sun and Mercury is closer: Mercury is closer about 80-90% of the time, and on average is 0.1 AU closer than Venus and nearly 0.7 AU closer than Mars. On a random day of the year, if you were to ask "Which planet is closest to Earth *right now*?" the odds will be about 17:3 in favour of Mercury over Venus. Unless somebody finds some prior art, it seems to be a genuinely new method of calculating the average distance between orbital bodies, which better captures the idea of "closer on average" than alternative methods used in the popular media.
But streams still do not solve the original issues pointed by trio author [1]. I.e. writer write to buffer, not sends to kernel socket. [1] https://vorpus.org/blog/some-thoughts-on-asynchronous-api-design-in-a-post-asyncawait-world/
Just use Django. Your site is more than a thin layer over an ORM, and Django gives you a lot more than that. If you hate the ORM, don’t use it, ignore the admin, and use the othe 90% of Django. Django’s orm is pretty much backend agnostic though. It’s design is such that you can maintain the same interface, and object code whilst using some other data store. The api surface is so small and not at all fixated on SQL that you can easily reimplement it for other backend. At work we have a library that uses it with Cassandra and ElasticSearch. That’s not something you need to worry about as you are using Postgres, but I am so sick of people thinking the ORM is designed this way for no reason.

Can you please outline which trio features are landing Python 3.8? I've looked at the current What's New and didn't find anything relevant. Thanks.
I found it interesting and inspiring that someone could find something like this and set a fact straight. It’s also a cool demonstration of something you can do with python that encouraged me. Yeah it’s not going to be a major factor changing the course of human history but why the fuck does it have to be that? It’s just a reddit post not a presentation at a space conference. Dickhead
&gt; By the way one of the reasons better power plants are needed in my opinion is that we need much larger ships to make these longer journeys! I strongly disagree with that. The problem is it costs $10,000 today to put a pound of payload into orbit (that's at the low end and a lot of that price is due to SpaceX revolutionizing launch costs). It gets exponentially worse the more delta V you need. I work on aircraft and most of what we care about is weight. I'd hate to work on spacecraft. The one project I got to work on a roller coaster was amazing; just throw more steel at the problem. It was still tricky, but at least I didn't have to worry about weight. We need efficiency in terms of propulsion and extreme weight savings to lower costs so the penalty for failure is lower and the pain on NASA's limited budget is less. &gt; I was think more about the various nuclear options Probes already use that. That is really the only practical power source for missions beyond Mars. &gt; I’m not expecting huge increases in travel velocity There are two ways that can happen. One is increased usage of gravity assist, but then again NASA and the ESA already have pretty complicated trajectories that they already take with multiple gravity assists being used. The other is ion engines (which , which takes a really long time, but can get going much faster than a typical liquid rocket. It just takes a lot longer and at some point you need to slow down. New Horizons launched in 2006 and got to Pluto in 2019. That's not great, but it's not terrible. There's a lot of science that we can do just at Jupiter or Saturn, so we don't really have a huge need for an advancement in propulsion. That's a lot closer.
&gt;"No reason"?.... Firstly authors of this Physics today article are material scientists. So you dont have to be a mathematician or a physicist to do this. This is simple algebra. They are not even considering 3D space in the article (Which is okay in my opinion). As for my qualifications, I use the same formula (in 3D) that authors use for my work in atomic proximity. What you are pretending to be so difficult is not that difficult. &gt;The article has a link to the original, in Physics Today,.... That is not a peer reviewed journal. &gt;But the PR bod working for NASA who write the sentence describing Venus as "our closest planetary neighbor" These are totally useless factoids. These engineers did not find something breakthrough, just gave a new interpretation to already existing knowledge. Which is again useless. But yah, its fun. Its just that. &gt;NASA isn't wrong..... But the linked article says in bold letters "Apparently even NASA is wrong about which planet is closest to Earth". To make things clear, what I hate is the hype around this project. Its not a peer reviewed paper, its not definite, it depends on interpretation and it is bloated up and shown as a ground breaking piece of science.
Yup but we ll be doing it in python, so laravel is out of equation and why you think future developers will not like django and like flask?
They're insisting on continuing Twisted support for Python 2 even after the core developers end support for Python 2 in 2020. As Guido said, they wouldn't have so many Python 2 users if they had announced plans to discontinue Python 2 support. Their own survey in the article suggests the bulk of their users are Python 2 users.
It was an allusion to another reply in the thread. I don't think a decent, mature developer would throw much of a fit over either choice.
Yup, should not give much thought to framework and pick one.
If you are building a backend to serve a RESTful API, I would highly recommend picking Flask. While Django has it strong points, it is geared toward sever side rendered templates and implements a MVC (Model View Controller) system. While you can create a RESTful API with Django either by hand or using other libraries, it isn't really worth the effort. If you do decide to go down the Flask route and can use Python 3.6 or greater, I would recommend using [Sanic](https://sanic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) instead. It is a web server framework that borrows the same syntax as Flask but supports native asynchronous handling of HTTP requests by leveraging Python 3's asyncio functionality. It is just as easy to use as Flask and it very pleasant to work with. Also, if you are going to use PostgreSQL for you database, take a look at [asyncpg](https://github.com/MagicStack/asyncpg) for your PostgreSQL driver instead of Psycopg2. It has async support and built in connection pooling.
I mean it's cool that they used python and all, it just doesn't seem like this is really a point that really would be contested by anyone with a reasonable level of knowledge on the topic. It's like someone using python to prove the earth is round.
OK, so? Deciding to support python 2, and older applications being more likely to both be using twisted and python 2 (which makes sense because twisted was the clear winner prior to asyncio), doesn't by any stretch imply that the twisted devs are "hellbent on ... destroying the rest of Python". If anything, twisted has an urgent need to look towards the future in order to remain relevant.
No, they're hellbent on destroying the rest of Python by pursuing an agenda of gutting the standard library. They're preserving Python 2 by continuing to support it and never ushering their users off of it.
IME twisted's current problems have to do with twisted's large surface area vs its relatively small amount of volunteer developers and its relative lack in corporate sponsorship. This means that they have a legitimate difficulty in migrating fully to python 3. For example, their docs generator is [stuck on](https://github.com/twisted/pydoctor/blob/master/pydoctor/astbuilder.py#L7) an [old python 2 era stdlib package](https://docs.python.org/2/library/compiler.html) for traversing an AST. [A new package for this sort of thing exists in python 3](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ast.html) but somebody has to sit down and actually do the work. Meanwhile, they're stuck running python 2 in tox - less than ideal. This kind of thing isn't a dastardly plot to hold back progress, it's the reality of trying to maintain a large MIT licensed project that's fallen relatively out of vogue.
[See my other comment.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/c1nxq8/toward_a_kernel_python/erkms7c/) It's very clear you've never actually worked on open source.
I guess one thing that rubs me the wrong way here is the method in which this fact is delivered. An example from the linked article: &gt;Earth is the third planet from the Sun, so our closest neighbor must be planet two or four, right? &gt; &gt;Wrong! Neither Venus nor Mars is the right answer. &gt; &gt;Three scientists ran the numbers. In this YouTube video, one of them explains why our nearest neighbor is... Mercury! The whole thing is phrased as a "gotcha" type of thing. They ask what's the closest planet to earth? and lots of people will say Venus or Mars, but they answer "Aha! you are wrong! It's actually Mercury because...." and you say "well ok, that does make sense, if you are talking about what planet \*spends the most time\* closest to earth." But it's kind of a trick question, because most people will assume that "what planet is closest to earth" means something more like "what planet \*travels\* closest to earth during it's orbit". The question is phrased in a way that is deliberately misleading, and then becomes kind of a bait and switch where what they are actually asking is something slightly different than what people infer. And again, this fact is not really a new discovery. The copy even reads a lot like clickbait: "Even NASA was wrong!". Oh, sure. People who actually do rocket science and orbital dynamics and such for a living didn't know about this. I don't see a quote but I can't imagine it's not the same kind of thing where what NASA said is taken here to mean here something they clearly didn't mean.

Also check great expectations. [https://great-expectations.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html#why-would-i-use-great-expectations](https://great-expectations.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html#why-would-i-use-great-expectations)
If the Admin is actually useful, that would make sense. As far as "picking batteries" goes, I almost always use the same ones to start with, so I don't spend extra time making those decisions. I think a lot of people who use flask start with a boilerplate repo so the process is like `git clone boilerplate .` `pip install -e .` and then start coding.

Interesting.comments. When talking about nuclear I’m talking about propulsion impulse engines. NASA is working on at least one potential variant but at the current rate it would be decades before a test flight. As for the flight vehicles I’m convinced that we will have to build something in space simply due to the size requirement. I seriously think NASA is on the wrong path here. What we need are ships that never land and instead ferry traveler to the moon or other locations using lightweight vehicles to land and reboard. From my perspective the problem is pretty simple, how do you pack enough supplies, redundancies and living space to to support the transfer of large numbers of people to their destinations. All one needs to do is look inside an Apollo era capsule or even a Space Shuttle and realize they are not suitable for the general exploration of space. Way too tight on space for humans and the supplies to keep them alive. Even for moon exploration I’d envision a flight vehicle with the interior space of at least a 747. Why? Well for one I don’t expect that we will be ferrying highly trained astronauts. Second even if the trip is cut to two days people will need exercise space and other distractions. Third cargo will always be a huge factor, even a small research station would need tons of supplies on every trip. Such a ship would need to be loaded in orbit and take on passengers via multiple resupply trips from ground. This makes far more sense to me than the current approach at NASA that basically reuses Apollo era tech. Frankly a lot of this tech is already proven via automated resupply to the space station. The only difference is orbit is temporary.
Oh yeah. I forgot about that one. I haven't used it yet but it does look promising.
Use Django or you will just end up creating your own worse version in Flask.
No picture for download :( Wanted to print it and put in photo stand in my cubicle.
Python is good for this, but you are in a gaffer tape situation. Those pre existing word and PDF forms likely get put in yet another Excel sheet so I'd be looking to see if my school could skip them and just use the input form you're going to make, and output that in all the different formats the school needs. I expect to see you in the databases sub Reddit by next week !
Username is always equal to "". You don't set it in the last line of that code block like you think you do. Move the two statements Username and UsernameEvtl.
I think the idea was to be a unique piece auctioned by PyLadies. It was bought by a group of people from Amazon for around $9k.
You really should be using python 3 my friend. If you insist try use 100.0 instead of 100.
Where are you setting the value of username to something other than "" ?
UsernameEvtl = Username and UsernameEvtl is from an import()
If you wanted to set the variable x to be equal to 5, how would you do it?
x = 5, i think
That is correct. So if you want to set the variable Username to be equal to the value of UsernameEvtl, how would you do it?
oh no, it's Username = UsernameEvtl, is it? Thanks for the awesome explanation!
SOLVED THANKS TO @JohnHilter &lt;3
No problem, I'm glad it clicked :)
Working on a simple Linux processes visualizer using D3.js and Flask. Using the [Tidy tree visualization](https://observablehq.com/@d3/tidy-tree) present in D3.js to view the hierarchical structure of the processes. Still in the process of fixing few minor bugs. (Tbvh I don't know if it's useful at all)
Oh, man. What took us as a community so long?

I've used Jinja2 + Pandoc to do this. I created the template files with proper markup using Jinja, rendered them as HTML files, then passed them to Pandoc to create shiny PDF files. I had to create 100+ page audits for work from BitBucket/Jira tickets, and the whole project was &lt;200 lines of Python and a single html template with macros.

The code that you are using to learn is very outdated. You should really learn Python 3 as /u/Bremme stated. However for this particular code, try changing your 2nd `%d` to `%f`.
www.stackoverflow.com
Thanks for the input guys, any recommendations on where to learn Python 3? How radical is the difference?
In case you don't get much of a response here, look elsewhere: - /r/learnjavascript/ - /r/learnpython - /r/webdev - /r/flask Good luck!
Indentation?
In general, it will get you better help if you describe what you want from your program that isn't working. &amp;#x200B; Now, your first issue is when you evaluate whether c\_ol is equal to one. Up until that point, you had never given it a value, with the exception of when you evaluated whether color was equal to 'random'. If it were, you wouldn't be running the elif statement. &amp;#x200B; The simplest solution to this is to change all occurrences of c\_ol with colour.
/r/learnpython has resources, and is a better place for your questions. Also, throw LPTHW into a fire. That book is garbage.

I would at least include reasons why that is if you’re going to make that statement.
I'm just a noob but I believe you need to convert x with str(x).
Found [good enough version](https://i.imgur.com/DI0ZLED.jpg) in [older thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/bl2d33/guido_with_a_painting_of_himself_that_was/)
the "f" is only applied to "it" since you used '' incorrectly
Direct link: https://www.humblebundle.com/books/programming-packt-books
the above syntax is python3, and it evaluates expressions in {}. so this works fine: x = 10 s = f'the value of x is {x}'
backslash `\` is your friend here.
Great post!
yep. i thought my syntax highlighter is defective. it *saw*!
no i actually hate it. but it gets the job done.
dammit please don't. bad bot.
Fair enough. Just my opinion from a recent experience. I took over a flask web&amp;api project (the choice of flask was made by the initial developer, not me) and it did not even have db migrations, we had to setup alembic etc. My point is that in general choosing django will make future developer's life easier because several components are coming out of the box (db migrations...) and are standard across django projects. But again, this is just my opinion. I understand that another developer might life the flexibility offered by flask.
Does your club really need a dynamic website? If it's more of a community knowledge base + blog then I'd recommend checking out static site generators. If you prefer Python the best choices are Pelican (more blog oriented) and MkDocs (article oriented, kinda like wiki). Comments may be enabled via third party service, e.g. Discuss.
I see what you did there ;-)
Building a Flask based web service that will return an Excel document consisting of a company's financial profile extracted from Yahoo Finance and other sources.
Silly question but does humble bundle keep purchased books in the library until I am ready for them or do i have to download them all to ensure I dont lose them?
head over to r/learnpython &amp;#x200B; to get you started, think about what packages you'll need to import to work with the OS. what kind of control structures are necessary to complete a task an arbitrary number of times?
Im not sure thats possible since Python is interpreted and not compiled.
I know I could figure it out if I tried. I was just being lazy and seeing if anyone wanted to write it for me. I need it in order to work on another project.
Python's CSV libary is great for reading and writing to excel files. It's really easy to use too!
I might get murdered for suggesting this, but you can use exec. I don't think there's another way to do the same thing. &amp;#x200B; Naturally, you need to be careful with security, so make sure there aren't any characters other than those valid in a variable name. But essentially, this might be: Name = input() exec(Name+"_Datafile = Table()") Or something like that. I think the more common approach is to use a database for this sort of thing. There is a Python-SQL connector available, though I haven't used it.
I'm not sure why it wouldnt be something your boss would want to know. Unless you wanted to reveal it at a particularly advantageous time.
&gt; but why the fuck does it have to be that? It’s just a reddit post not a presentation at a space conference. Did you even read the title? &gt; Three scientists publish a paper... It's not just a reddit post.
True but it’s still clearing up a common piece of misinformation and giving people a source to cite. Definitely not groundbreaking research but there’s nothing wrong with it.
&gt; how do you pack enough supplies, redundancies and living space to to support the transfer of large numbers of people to their destinations To where? Certainly we're not talking further than Mars, right? Cause if we wanted to go somewhere besides the Moon or Mars or maybe Ceres, it's really, really far. &gt; All one needs to do is look inside an Apollo era capsule or even a Space Shuttle and realize they are not suitable for the general exploration of space. Well no. Apollo was designed for a moon mission and specifically surviving reentery. The shuttle was designed for reusability and surviving reentery and storing large payloads. If you're going to Mars where you don't really have an atmosphere, the Shuttle is completely the wrong thing to send. At this point in time, a general vehicle for interplanetary space travel would be a giant waste of money. For these missions to be successful and cost a sane-ish amount of money, you have to make it very specialized and only be able to do exactly what it is designed for. A bit of extra weight is a massive cost penalty. &gt; Second even if the trip is cut to two days people will need exercise space and other distractions. Why? Just stick them in a tight container and barely let them move. That's how astronauts got to the moon. Also, what's wrong with 3 days? You probably just doubled the cost of the mission by cutting one day off. The burn time is a very tiny fraction of the total travel time. To limit fuel and cost, you want a longer trip. Also, why do you need to send people on the resupply mission? &gt; This makes far more sense to me than the current approach at NASA that basically reuses Apollo era tech. To do the Apollo mission? Makes sense to me. It was well designed. While computers have changed, aerodynamics has not. &gt; Frankly a lot of this tech is already proven via automated resupply to the space station. The only difference is orbit is temporary. A lot of the degradation in the ISS's orbit is due to the fact that the station is in near-earth orbit and not say geosyncronous orbit. As far as space goes, the ISS might as well be inside the atmosphere. We could have stuck the ISS at a stable Lagrange point, in which case, it would not be temporary. It would have taken more fuel to get there though.
&gt; Future developers coming to the project will thank you for this Except the Django developers I suppose?
Genuine question, not trying to start a war: what would be the point of spending time on getting familiar with all of them instead of focusing on one or two and get really good at those?
Because, just like the poster I ridicule in that sentence, I assume everyone's like me, Django developers will inevitably become Flask, and eventually net/http developers.
Still trying to see if my ["game engine"](https://github.com/wilfred-kun/pynegin/tree/devel) goes anywhere.
Or just ignore learnpython and send people to stackoverflow, where they have a solid triage process for those types of questions.
Your ' real "friend" ' here is understanding that when you use single quotes you can still use double quotes inside your single and vice versa. f"This works well too, well, if it's what you're after" I always just use double quotes for that reason. Makes it super easy to type.

you are not wasting your time. I am not a pro python developer im just a networking guy but one thing i have is a vision of what i want to do with python and networking and then i got there practicing and googling. You really need to make a list of what you want to do with python, then what you want to fix, for me for example if i connect a juniper switch to my laptop and configure my interface as DHCP, it will configure the template i use so is kinda ready to deploy.

Adding one more vote for Django. It will easily handle this project, comes with builtin db admin and is more of the solution as provided. Choose flask if you're already a huge SQLAlchemy fan.
We had to mix flask with green unicorn at my last job to get any kind of performance. Is Django the same way?
I always use double quotes for strings now. I find myself needing to use a single quote much more often than I need the symbol for inches.

Can’t hurt to ask. Except my feelings when people are rude.

I like how JavaScript handles it. Back-tics for string literals, and I can keep my single quotes everywhere else.
Using gunicorn (or similar) is the "proper" way to use both Flask and Django. Built-in servers are not particularly optimized, and don't receive security audits (which, IMO, is bad, but nobody cares). They're only intended for prototyping work. Not that it stops anyone. Performance is only occasionally a real issue, security always comes third, and the mental health price is always paid by the guys who join after the rock stars have left.
How do you write it in the comments like that the correct way?, im on my phone
Use 4 spaces at the start of every line that you want to look like code. For in-line code `like this`, use the \` backtick characters around the text.

I'm not sure I completely understand what you're looking for as I'm not a web programmer. If you want a "Python Front End" that is controlled through a web browser, consider trying [PySimpleGUIWeb](https://github.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI/tree/master/PySimpleGUIWeb). You can use the same PySimpleGUI code that you write for the desktop and run it in your web browser by using PySimpleGUIWeb instead of PySimpleGUI (tkinter based). I'm interested in learning more places PySimpleGUIWeb can and can't be used so always on the lookout for potential matches and if running a GUI in a web browser is something you want to do, then what the heck, take the 10 minutes to install and run the demo programs.
That's very sound advice. Though in my case im also an artist and i'm looking to be a solo dev, out of passion though, since i've already got my career choice. Would you have any advice for me in this case?
Looks great, but it also makes me wanna barf.

I have had this dilemma in the past. I chose to reveal successes immediately because my boss is a really nice guy and would appreciate initiative and give me credit too. If you think your boss might not be as generous I would use the newly generated free time to build more tools or do more learning. Then when you have enough kapow to really wow your whole company you can keep all the credit try to generate your own new job position or at least upgraded duties and pay. Good luck!
For me, the standard library is important because it's highly curated, so you know you are not going to be installing malware into your project if you use one of the standard libraries. If there was a highly curated version of pip install where your choice would not be "potentially terrible", that would be good. Some pip libraries are so good and universally useful that they should probably be considered "standard" libraries in some sense (pillow, anyone?) but right now there is no standard way to sift the wheat from the chaff.
Be on the lookout for it on hackaday. Good work.
&gt;for a number of edge cases you’ll need a virtual environment to install packages Such as?

Did you use anything from vtki? It's a more friendly and pythonic interface to vtk that makes interop with numpy and vtk object creation much easier. I was recently very impressed with stuff in that library from recent months enabling jupyter interactivity with vtk scenes. I think it was rendering just an image from a vtk scene which you could then update dynamically with widgets.

easiest way would be to use html and make a datauri out of the image
Looking for my next fun project actually :)
You could use google collabatory
IMO to start with just stay with Python if that is what you already know. &amp;#x200B; Within Python you could use Flask or Django (or whatever) and serve template HTML. You will of course need some CSS for styling and then if you find that HTML and CSS are not enough for the functionality you require THEN you will need to learn some Javascript.
A) Do you have multiple Python versions installed? &amp;#x200B; B) Have you removed old versions from PATH &amp;#x200B; C) Are you updating PATH w/ the new installation?
Nginx with gunicorn, or maybe Uvicorn, should be the (ever so slightly) faster option.
Just use Windows Subsystem for Linux, the new version's meant to fix most of the problems with it.
You should really use a dictionary. Also, /r/learnpython.
Any documentation on what's new in this newfangled semantic analyser? Changelog just mentions it's new, not what's different about it.
This is awesome. Thank you for doing this!
Thanks! I'm glad I could help!
I indeed had other versions of Python installed. I removed all my python installations, and reinstalled Python 3.7, and now pip3 is working out of the box. A different version of pip/python indeed seemed to be the issue. Do you know what the preferred way is to solve the first issue?
We want users of our program to run a couple of Python scripts. Having them install Windows Subsystem for Linux seems like a bit of an overkill...
I don't like or use windows, it is no longer the native development platform it once was. The future is linux. Even in Windows, the future is linux. However, if you have to use Python on Windows, and I have to use it sometimes, perhaps try anaconda. There is a smaller version called miniconda. It still supports pip, but also has its own package manager. It is widely used. I use it on Windows because on Windows it just works. Maybe give it a try.
It mentions a bit: &gt; In particular, it deals better with import cycles and forward references. In general, I think it's basically an under-the-hood change that fixes various corner cases of the previous one. Not something super shiny but makes everything more solid overall.
I've never dug into rectifying PATH issues to multiple Pythons. &amp;#x200B; My guess is there's a way to refer to the specific Python version. &amp;#x200B; Since it's in the path, you may be able to just change the name of the executable to reflect the version(?). &amp;#x200B; Don't take my word on that but that'd be my guess.
Rabbit is the White rabbit from Monty Python and the holy grail. The python language might have a snake logo but it's derived from Monty python... Watch that shit if you haven't seen it
Monty Python and the holy Grail is the rabbit, and Monty Python is where the name of the language comes from
&gt; As you see, one gets the wrong impression in above statement the love equals True No, they don't, because that's not how the `if` statement is specified to behave. Quoting the documentation: &gt; It selects exactly one of the suites by evaluating the expressions one by one until one is found to be true (see section [Boolean operations](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#booleans) for the definition of true and false)
I'm not familiar with "Code IDE", but it might not set up pylint correctly? It's hard to know, I tried searching for it but it has a terrible name from an SEO point of view so I haven't been able to find it in order to try and replicate the error. Do you have a link for me?
Is this a database table or a Python variable?

Ah right. When you said dev, I assumed you meant software engineer. Knowing Python as an artist gives you a lot of power. I deliver lectures to game art university students on getting into the industry, so I know a thing or two. That’s in the UK though. I’m guessing you’re US based, right? The piece of advice that I often hear, but disagree with is that you should consider getting your foot in the door by starting as a QA engineer. I was at an AAA company, and saw plenty of art students start as QA. Five years later, they were still QA, and all that time, they were watching less experienced artists start as juniors. Again, you need to specialise: - environment art - weapon art - vehicle art - technical art ** - fx art ** - UI * - texture art * - lighting art * - character rigging - concept art - character art I would advise against character and concept art because there’s too much competition. The bar is ridiculously high. The starred roles are the ones that are more in demand. The double stars are unicorn roles. If you choose these, you’ll find yourself in a very short queue. Your portfolio website needs to be clear and focused on your speciality. Being a jack of all trades will not help you. If you want to work solo, I would advise to get a few years AAA experience first, as you need to understand the development cycle. You need to understand working with game assets as part of a big project so you can understand the build process, testing and optimisation. Freelance artists I know retired as lead artists to start their own companies, so they are experts. Software: - You need to know Max AND Maya. Only knowing one will put you out of the running for many positions. - Photoshop - Zbrush - Substance Hope that helps...
Where can I get one of these made with me in it?
The following values are interpreted as false: False, None, numeric zero of all types, and empty strings and containers. Everything else is true. It is a balance between strictness and convenience.
Thank you very helpful.
You don't need to do that. You can modify`globals()` instead: globals()[f'{name}_datafile'] = Table() Even if you trust the user, you don't want a syntax-error if they mistype the name. Regardless, this is a clear antipattern and a clear sign you should put things in a dict instead: datafile = {} name = input('table name: ') datafile[name] = Table()
PyVista is vtki - we changed the name this project from vtki to PyVista after a request from the makers of VTK.
Reminds me of a cameo appearance by Linus Torvalds as a peasant storming the Bastille in a mural at the Bastille metro station in Paria.
I use nginx with gunicorn and it works great.
Are the people there assembling a jigsaw puzzle of the same picture?
&gt; As you see, one gets the wrong impression in above statement the love equals True How do you get that impression? You're evaluating the truthiness of ```love == this`` and get the result "yes, those two are equal".
yes
Fantastic! I'm super eager to play with this now! I'm building a 3D editor UI for interacting with a legacy code my employer uses that has a lot of engineering geometry input and output. While one of my products is a PyQt GUI, I'm also building a bunch of notebook tools and this makes my day because I should be able to visualize my parts and geometries much more interactively in the notebook!
It’s not auto-converting anything, you’re just misunderstanding the difference between [comparison](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/stdtypes.html#comparisons) and [Truth value testing](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/stdtypes.html#truth-value-testing). The == operator does a comparison on equivalence, and unless you’ve got a `Thing.__eq__` implementation that does something strange then, per the docs, “[o]bjects of different types, except different _numerical_ types, never compare equal” (emphasis mine). Thus both `thing == True` and `thing == False` will both be False when **thing** is neither a **bool** nor a numerical type (ie a subclass of **numbers.Number**, such as **int**, **float**, but also **decimal.Decimal**. etc). The **if** operator does a truth value test, and, also per the docs, “[b]y default, an object is considered true unless its class defines either a `__bool__()` method that returns False or a `__len__()` method that returns zero, when called with the object.” Thus `if thing: foo()` will call **foo** unless **thing** is assigned to a value already considered False (0, {}, None) or has a `thing.__bool__` method that explicitly returns False when called. Python is strongly typed, no implicit casts are happening in the above, and the results you’ve observed support that fact, as you’d only get the behavior you seem to expect if Python were weakly typed or implicit casts were occurring.

You are misinterpreting what you are seeing because you think that `if` can only branch on the actual `True` or `False` bool objects. But that's not the case. `if` (and also `while`) will branch on *any object at all* using duck-typing, depending on whether objects duck-type as truthy or falsey. Just as `for x in obj` will accept any iterable object, not just lists, `if obj` will accept any object which can duck-type as truthy or falsey, not just `True` or `False`. In fact, for about the first ten or so years of Python, until version 2.2, there were no standard `True` or `False`, and people used to define their own: False = 0 True = not False For (nearly) all built-in objects, and many third-party objects, truthy objects represent "something" and falsey objects represent "nothing" or "lack of something": Falsey objects include: - numeric zeroes (int, float, Decimal, Fraction, complex); - empty strings (Unicode or byte strings); - empty containers (lists, sets, dicts, tuples); - None; - unless overridden, any object where `len(obj)` returns 0; - anything that quacks like a false value; Truthy objects include: - numeric non-zero values; - non-empty strings; - non-empty containers; - unless overridden, any object where `len(obj)` returns a non-zero size; - by default, any object; - anything that quacks like a true value. `True` and `False` are merely the canonical truthy and falsey values, they aren't special in any other way. &gt; considering that "Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules", this rule shouldn't be broken too! The rule isn't broken, you have just misunderstood the rule. You think that the rule is: - branch if `obj == True` but it isn't. The rule is: - branch if `obj` quacks like a truthy object. &gt; The above statement should result in a cast error instead of an implied True (thus executing print("chaos")), don't you think? No I don't.
&gt; [b]y default, an object is considered true unless its class defines either a __bool__() method that returns False or a __len__() method that returns zero, when called with the object. I understand that and that's exactly where I think a special case exception for strong types has been made for bools! If you "consider" an object to be `True` under x circumstances, then you are violating a basic principle of strong typing: An object should be true only when its **value** is true and false when its **value** is false. If the value is neither true , nor false (like in case of "", [], {}, etc.), then they are not booleans at all, its as simple as that! A type exception should be raised in that case instead of assuming "", [], etc. to be false values! In fact, this is exactly what PHP does as its a weakly typed language! You pass a zero length string like if ("") and the if will hold true and that's exactly why PHP gets the blame too! But being a strongly typed language, Python shouldn't do that, that's what I think. I can understand treating [], {}, "" as false values for practical purposes, it all depends on whether practicality or strong typing is a priority for you. But understand that you are sacrificing strong typing here in order to gain practicality!
Nice, Gj! I remember I wrote a Python script to do a bunch of elliptical curve computations for my crypto homework, I used a print statement to print out the intermediate steps and copied them onto paper :)
Well done. May i suggest you looking at matplotlib? The next logical step is to visualise your results.
Something wrong with provided code example: 1) How can you use your class method without instance of that class or annotation? 2) Strange call: Name.nameclass.say\_hello() &amp;#x200B; Provide all your normally formatted code and screenshot where you " Invoking the interpreter directly from the command line, the following code works"
For hosting free side projects, the is also `google appengine`, they provide a lot in the free tier (at least a lot more than PythonAnywhere if I remember correctly).
Slightly off topic: Does anyone know of a good python linting library which I can use for tasks like checking unused imports in my package, creating a dependency packages list using the rest, etc.?

Apache or nginx won't be your bottleneck. Choose whatever you are more familiar with. If you do not have a preference, nginx would be the more modern choice. You can shoot yourself in the foot with both, though.
Sure, but it needs a credit card and tax details to register. PythonAnywhere is hassle free.
I don't understand why you are using `sleep` there? Especially during printing of the results - wouldn't you want to get you results as fast as possible?
No, you’re not making an such sacrifice. No type exception could be raised because typing — and especially type conversion — is _not_ involved. Look _carefully_ at the quote from the docs: “an object is considered to be true”, does _not_ read “an object is considered to be True”. There is no class comparison happening in truth-value testing, no conversion ... in fact there is no **bool** involved except incidentally, there is just a test to determine a property of the object under test. Think of the truth value test like this: def truth(thing): if hasattr(thing, “__bool__”) and thing.__bool__() is False: return False if hasattr(thing, “__len__”) and thing.__len__() is 0: return False return True Thus you can think of the **if** statement as doing this: if truth(thing) is True: handle_ truthy() else: handle_falsey() The _type_ is thing is never tested, nor is it ever cast... no violation of strong typing has, _in any fashion_, occurred. This: &gt; An object should be true only when its value is true and false when its value is false. _Is not_ a principle of strong typing, because nether “true” or “false” in this case refers to a _type_ of thing. This, however: &gt; An object should be True only when its value is True and False when its value is False. _Is_ such a principle, and absolutely holds true for Python, as aptly demonstrated by `thing == True` and `thing == False` both being False.
I did this as a kid to get the feeling that the computer was thinking/processing something that was hard and took time and show the output........... I loved that feeling
Ah, the old corporate approach. a) Add random delays to make it look like the software is working *really hard* b) remove delays from next version to claim a n% speedup. Classics never die!
Heres my takeaway from trying the following: - pylint: slow but has a lot of linting checks, and is therefore quite valuable. - black: Quite fast and stable, but no configuration so I could not use it. - flake8: fast, but some times It wont work with larger projects or larger files. - yapf: fast a has a lot of checks and works well with large projects. Generally I use pylint and yapf and they play well together. I dont know if they create dependency lists.
No it doesn't in the basic free tier! You need credit card only if you want to use a potentially paid resource which has a free tier (such as cloud-sql or maps api).
Write a translator that generates code for Latex drawings so you can hand the homework in as beautifully as possible ;))
Yup, two ways of working around time consuming operations: * If its too fast add random sleeps here and there * If its too slow add a progress bar
Yeah, changing the name of the executable works, and is what I'm currently doing, but it seems a little awkward.
This week other than doing python development for my work. I'll be trying to do the following: * Learn backend distributed programming using three \`raspberry pi zero w\`s plugged into a usb 3 hub. * Might deploy a new version of pydoro to PyPI. (I might be breaking the audio part to a new reusable module.) * Doing some Java/Android development.
They didn't use circular orbits, they used [pyephem](https://rhodesmill.org/pyephem/), which uses ellipses based on measured orbital elements as its basis, as far as I can tell. This should be reasonably accurate to 100s of years in the future and past, not really sure about the 10000 years that they ran the integration for.
As said above, please get rid of those random sleeps. They do not only waste time, they also make the code way harder to read. There are two more things I noticed: 1. Right at the beginning, when the user is asked for an input, you do this: while choice != 1 and choice != 2: print("Please enter either 1 or 2") time.sleep(1) choice = int(input("1. Find missing Leg or Hypotenuse\n2. Find the six trigonometric functions\n Choice: ")) break While I get what you are trying to do, you might want to review loops again. The break statement will always, well, break your loop, no matter what the input is. Assuming I'd give the input '42' on the first prompt, I'd get into that loop. I'd get asked again, but, the dumbass I am, I enter '104' after I get the prompt. Although the loop's condition still holds, as soon as I hit enter, I reach the break-statement and step out of the loop. Plus, if you add console based user interaction, prepare for people doing stupid stuff. I might want to enter 'Tim', which would break your program, when it tried to parse that to an integer. 2. Your
I think it's a bit fast, at least for being able to appreciate the pattern.
Another suggestion: with the hypotenuse calculation, your variable named ```hypotenuse``` is actually ```hypotenuse```&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and you do the ```sqrt``` last-minute inside the print statement. If you'd want to use the result later on, you'd have to run the calculation again! It's cleaner to compute the exact variable you need, under an accurate and correct name, and then make a print statement using that variable.
You can import the script or run the script inside your script just as you would in the interpreter
1. /r/learnpython 2. You can import the second script as a module and call it after the first one is done.
If you installed the `py` launcher, you can select Python 3.7 with `py 3.7`. To run pip, you can do `py 3.7 -m pip`.

Write script2.py
Good stuff, I've been trying and failing to do this, looking forward to applying it to my projects. I'll do it on GitLab instead but I suspect it will be pretty much the same !
yes /r/learnpython read the sidebar
Your second script will be executed when your first script imports it. To avoid this behaviour and have it execute when you want to call it, you should wrap your second script in a main() function, i.e. **second script** `def main():` `#your code` `if __name__ = __main__:` `main()` This way, when you `import secondscript` in your first script, the second script will only run when you call `secondscript.main()`
I'm not sure what the consensus here is, but when I want to run more than one python file I like to create a simple wrapper file where all of the others get imported and run. It makes it easier for me to process it when I separate out in this way.
Python is actually named because of Monty Python
That's definitely not the list of frameworks you want to learn in 2019. I can understand Django &amp; Flask, they're giants. &amp;#x200B; But others - hell no. Not to offend anybody, but they are definitely not most widely used and they don't seem to be trendy. &amp;#x200B; I'd rather check [Starlette](https://www.starlette.io/) and everything that around it, like an awesome [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/). I also wish that [Vibora](https://github.com/vibora-io/vibora) become viable by the end of 2019.
Thanks! And yep, you'd just need to configure the webhook.

Other options instead of nginx or Apache: https://caddyserver.com/ https://docs.traefik.io/ Caddy advertises itself as out of the box HTTPS ready. Traefik should be able to do that as well + it has container orchestration integration.

**black** is just an opiniated formatter. It does not do any sort of checks that /u/prahladyeri was asking about. I suspect that, within a few years, most Python projects done in collaboration will have adopted **black** as a formatter; the lack of configuration is one aspect that makes it valuable as it eliminates pointless discussions about what formatting rule to use.
Any idea how to deploy it through Android?
Love it but things like this freak me out. I have this theory that we can never explore all of space because it's too big. Also I think we can't ever zoom all the way in. What if things get infinitely smaller too?

I think you're misunderstanding lies in the fact that, in Python, truth value is not a _type_, but a _protocol_ (much like iteration, indexing and calling). Would you say that doing `SomeType()` is weakly typed because `SomeType` is "converted to a function"?

I expected to see mista here
Thanks for the article! I personally haven't found any of the "edge cases" you mention- Docker is a great isolation layer, and a more thorough one than virtualenvs at that. What are some examples of use cases that'd require virtualenvs inside Docker containers? (I guess if you wanted to use Pipenv? Maybe? That's never sat super well with me either.)
You might want to look [pylama](https://github.com/klen/pylama) which nicely wraps a lot of using tools like that.
Elliptic curves are a better use case for this sort of approach. Not sure I agree with OP's motive here. Trig is a fundamental discipline. Gotta go through the pain of writing it out if you hope to learn it. Otherwise, nice to see your first repo! Keep it up. Keep learning, but seriously: write out your trig homework by hand!
Pylint is the best (or only, never seen another proper linter for python, that's not only for style) option availabe. It has some annoying defaults you may need to tweak before it's comfortable, but is very thorough. It has an option to generate an analysis report that also includes the module dependency tree.
Why is your first point even an issue? The shebang is meaningless to windows itself, and the `py` launcher recognises that you want python 3 and works correctly even though you don't have a `python3.exe`. Don't change the name of the executable; you will break your installation. For the second one, `python -m pip` is the recommended way to run pip these days. Anyone telling you to use `pip3` is out of date.
 `pip install pylatex`
Is that a thing?
A lazy programmer programs a lazy program
I'd be okay with it being opinionated if it didn't choose so many ugly opinions. They made so many weird formatting choices on where to break parenthesis and method chains, forcing double quotes, etc, that the code looks wrong.
A QA engineer walks into a bar. Orders 0x00 beers. Orders beers. Orders -1 beers. Orders bobby;-- DROP TABLE students beers. Orders 1
The only way to do this is to build a c# backend and pipe the data from one script to a other. Probably just stick to single file scripts for now

Everything works just fine. After the grand opening, a customer walks into the bar and asks for the toilet. The bar bursts up in flames.
I've had lots of success with flake8 and the bugbear extension. Yapf and black are just formatters. Black intentionally has little configuration so everyone doesn't start tweaking they're configuration files and then it's a formatting war in the repo.
@OP your being slaughtered in the comments about things you did not do perfectly. But remember, a lot of people never finish anything in this field. A lot of the people commenting have projects that they have been "working on" for years and will never finish. Keep your head up, your doing great, keep learning. Also, try r/learnpython they are a tad bit more supportive of new developers like you and I.
Apparently it is https://jeltef.github.io/PyLaTeX/current/ the road to fully automated homework is almost paved
well you're not going to get anywhere by being lazy. give it some thought, find a solution. work on other stuff, learn more - come back later and look at what you wrote and be embarrassed at how bad it is. then be proud of yourself for improving so much that your old work looks like garbage.
I worked with another software engineer before for a project i am leading. This guy has been on this company and i just joined recently, so i think he feels privileged. This was my first time leading a project. We are on the stage of either making the software fast and he deviated and created his own solution. My solution worked very well and spits results in a blink of an eye. His solution takes around 4 seconds and he is very enthusiastic on the progress bar he made and thought the owners of the company will like it. It was a pointless argument and i let it slide but it was not what the owners envisioned the product to be. On the demo day, the CEO talked to me and told me it was very slow and slower than the previous implementation. I was reprimanded and i told them that it wasn't my decision. But they told me that I'm leading the project. I was heart broken that day and i scrapped what the other software engineer did, implemented my solution, and i did a second demo. The CEO and the owners are very happy because the version i demonstrated to them is lightning fast which what they really want in the first place. This situation made me stronger as a lead engineer. Although, I still do encounter insubordinate engineers and really stubborn/toxic ones.
The Python ecosystem truly is amazing
&gt;treedoc Looks good.
Yea i did mix formatters in there - to a certain point I agree with the lack of configuration can be valuable, but I just do not like the configuration it comes with. Besides an organization can simply decide on a conf file for yapf/another formatter and then keep it static - it requires one more step than using black but allows you to get something that fits your org better.
I used to do this sort of thing with BASIC on my calculator, and people would want to get my programs from me with the little transfer cable. That was fun. Anyway, yeah, the `sleep` functions are kinda weird. Why don't you want your answers as fast as the computer can give them to you?
nginx and apache are both high performance and you won't be able to meaningfully distinguish between them on that metric in the vast majority of circumstances. &amp;#x200B; until you're serving something like 10K requests/sec AND you're not bottlenecking on any of the far more likely sources (database query time, template render time, upstream network latency, etc.) then this is a totally irrelevant decision and you should choose whichever one you find more pleasant to work with.
Ha, that's awesome. I just finished my first script ever to handle some data entry tasks, and it was taking awhile (large Excel files + shitty PCs) and people thought it was dead so they'd kill the process. Added a progress bar to let them know it was in fact doing something to get that to stop. Worked like a charm!
/r/learnpython
&gt; using my brain is too much of a task for me to solve homework so i decided to spend more than an hour writing a script to do the work for me. You have the makings of a True Programmer. I use python to help my solve some of the word puzzles in the NYTimes magazine.
Ill try out the bugbear extension then, thanks for the tip :) I do use flake8 and pylint for linting and then yapf for formatting personally, but maybe flake8 can be used for formatting instead of yapf.
Thanks for the tip, I'll check it out!
On your journey, check out the ‘’’@property’’’ decorator. Using setters and getters isn’t considered Pythonic. It’s not wrong, but Python has some tools to make that code even more beautiful. ;) Congrats on taking the first steps, as well! Programming can be a wild journey that can lead to all sorts of unexpected places. Enjoy the view.
How did you prepare for your job. Did you make a portfolio, etc. how much did you learn before you got the job.
I find it simplest to use www.repl.it
Use their API &amp; get a key. See here: [https://developers.google.com/custom-search/v1/overview](https://developers.google.com/custom-search/v1/overview)
I was hoping the new semantic analyzer would handle this case. But it looks like it doesn't: ```python import typing class Node(typing.NamedTuple): child: 'Node' ``` ``` $ mypy example.py example.py:4: error: Recursive types not fully supported yet, nested types replaced with "Any" ```
My guess is that's what happening here.
You could run the second script as a subprocess from the first script.
I want people to think my script is sophisticated and cool 😤
\&gt; The shebang is meaningless to windows itself &amp;#x200B; What do you mean? If python3 is a recognized command, the shebang instructs to use that command to execute this file, even on Windows. Is there a way to write this shebang in a way that it works on all platforms? &amp;#x200B; Or is there a way to run this script on windows? Note that this script is not in the current directory but in some arbitrary folder of my path, and I do not want to specify the exact path to the folder where the script is located. (it is unacceptable if I have to tell users to write \`py /path/to/obscure/folder/in/path/my\_script.py\` instead of \`my\_script\`) &amp;#x200B; \&gt; Don't change the name of the executable; you will break your installation. &amp;#x200B; That's fair. Would it be fine to copy the executable and have a duplicate executable python3.exe? &amp;#x200B; \&gt; Anyone telling you to use pip3 is out of date. &amp;#x200B; Ok, I didn't know that. Thanks for the heads up.
Thank you so much! I’m trying to challenge myself by looking at ways that would stop the user from entering anything else and I’m still wrapping my head around it. Still couldn’t figure out how to loop it properly. Thank you again for your advice!
And after I have downloaded them are they still in the library as a backup?
I see it as advice more than criticism, I understand I’m a beginner programmer and I’m gonna do a lot of mistakes and that’s fine if people point out stuff in my code. Hopefully they point out something useful so I can improve myself. But thank you!

&gt; As said above, please get rid of those random sleeps. They do not only waste time, they also make the code way harder to read. &gt; &gt; There is one more thing I noticed: &gt; &gt; Right at the beginning, when the user is asked for an input, you do this: You do you man, we have all been there. :)
Hey /u/mutilatedllama, I wanted to make sure you saw this reply.
might also want to research Python error handling and the `try` and `except` keywords to handle people putting in stuff that will throw errors, like `"Tim"`. choice = 0 while choice not in range(3): print("Please select:") print("1. Find missing Leg or Hypotenuse") print("2. Find the six trigonometric functions") try: choice = int(input("Choice: ")) except ValueError: print("That is not a valid choice.")
Not a book, but I'm making a tutorial series on YouTube that will cover everything from the ground up. It's aimed at aspiring game designers, but the Python part is just Python. First two parts are out already. Let me know if your interested, or just check my history. I don't wanna spam.
Oh my god I totally forgot about that, I’ll look into it. Thank you!!
I like nginx + uwsgi. Nginx can speak uwgi's binary protocol to it directly over a unix socket, which is more efficient than speaking http to gunicorn over an inet socket. I also like all the various features that uwsgi brings to the table.
Did the YouTube channel creator even created the videos? I quickly went through few videos and noticed the presenters were different.
There is also an the itk-jupyter-widget, it is based on vtk.js and itk.js and allow to visualize 2D and 3D images directly within Jupyter. See [https://github.com/InsightSoftwareConsortium/itk-jupyter-widgets#readme](https://github.com/InsightSoftwareConsortium/itk-jupyter-widgets#readme) It can even work with PyVista. See [https://github.com/InsightSoftwareConsortium/itk-jupyter-widgets/blob/master/examples/pyvista.UniformGrid.ipynb](https://github.com/InsightSoftwareConsortium/itk-jupyter-widgets/blob/master/examples/pyvista.UniformGrid.ipynb) I'm an engineer at Kitware, let me know if I can answer any questions related to this.
i learnt python a few months ago, just the basic stuff not even intermediate but never made anything. it makes me so happy to see that you're using it, good job on your attitude, always learn from wherever you can
Be careful returning print() expressions, what you are really doing is returning None. Good luck on your journey!
On Unix the shebang tells the operating system that the script should be executed like just as though the user had typed this into the terminal: `/usr/bin/env python3 my_script.py`. On windows the shebang means nothing. Windows doesn't use shebangs at all. However, the `py.exe` launcher will look at the shebang if there is one, and use it to help figure out what version of python to use. Note that it doesn't just run `python3.exe` blindly. It will see there is a `python3` in the shebang and know that it needs to locate a python 3 installation and use the appropriate command for it. `python3.exe` does not have to exist on the path for any of this to work. The shebang that you have is the correct one, that will be the most useful it can be on every operating system. If you want users to be able to run `my_script` then the directory that script is in needs to be on the PATH. `python` (or `python3` or whatever) does not need to be on the path because python files should be associated with the `py.exe` launcher and it already knows the location of all your python installations. Don't copy the executable either. You do not need a `python3.exe` on your system. In general, you shouldn't make any changes to installed programs at all, except through the dedicated installer programs or package managers.
Nice. How much time did it take you to finish this project? I am learning from codeacademy and Automate boring stuff.
If I’ve learned anything, is that it’s important to stay consistent with your learning because I’ve been “learning” programming for almost a year now but since I haven’t been consistent with my learning I haven’t achieved what I would’ve achieved in that time period. But now I got my head back in the game and I’m doing the “100 days of code” challenge and it really makes me push myself to not stop learning even on the lazy days.
Took me 4 days to code this one and how much do u recommend automate the boring stuff with Python?
how do you do it?, the word puzzle solver. give me a brief explanation and i'll try to do it on my own
Im fairly new to python as well, and im learning through codecademy. Its been very helpful so far. Good luck!
Have you considered making your script sophisticated and cool?
Thank you! I have decided to tell my boss I'm working on it at the moment and will test it next time the task comes up.
OK. About the automate boring stuff, it's fast &amp; direct approach to programming. He covers all the basics very fast. I think people who are absolutely new to programming may find him hard to follow. You should be ready to learn at fast pace and practical stuff. I like it but I love codeacademy more. The difference is codeacademy pushes you to write something all the time. They have interactive way of learning. You read theory on left panel and write code on right to proceed forward.
Remind me of the project I had to do for school this year, but your version seem more polished. Nice job!
Could you share the link if u don't mind ?
[Codeacademy](https://www.codecademy.com/catalog/language/python)
Nothing wrong with that as you know your boss and your situation best. Im aspiring to learn how to link python with a browser UI for web or intranet since the fact of the matter is that people respond better when your proof of concept is pretty.
Thanks mate😁
&gt; Monty Python is where the name of the language comes from orly
How did you add the progress bar? I assume it wasn't static, right?
Why not pass `U0` to the constructor rather than `set_initial_conditions`?
Being fast is cool! "Look how fast my program can calculate this!"
Ooof, I feel for you. Thankfully the better solution was accepted in the end, unfortunately I've seen things where it wasn't. &gt; Although, I still do encounter insubordinate engineers and really stubborn/toxic ones. Well, we all do don't we? And it's worse when it's someone with a "big name" and clout within the organization. Screw standard office politics, here's when it becomes real.
Nice work!
Nice job! Main thing I'd change is casting those inputs to floats, not ints. I assume that sometimes you will have inputs with a decimal, and you don't want to lose that information by casting to ints.
I feel like I read an article on the human element of program interactions that suggested the optimal time a person was willing to wait for information and how if they are waiting slightly they are more invested in the outcome. Not sure I completely agreed but im not a human behaviour expert.
It'd depend on the word puzzle, first of all. Is it a word search, a crossword or what have you?
tqdm
Yeah but like I don't want my calculator, which is basically what this is, to artificially "churn" and make it look like it's doing stuff. I got stuff I need to get done! Gimme the answers! Calculators should be spitting out answers as fast as they can do it. `2` `+` `2` `=` `4`, not `2` `+` `2` `=` [2 SECONDS] `4`
Alternatively you can try Selenium
not far off. studies show that if a site is too fast users perceive the results being low quality; too slow and users have a poor perception of the quality of the site and the results. There's a sweet spot in the middle for the average user. I've read other studies that suggest that the effect is much less prominent for people who have experience with the data being asked for or experience in that field. many sites have some kind of _thinking_ animation but don't do anything
If you really REALLY need to use Google you'll need to get an api key, I've been there. If you don't necessary need google then use bing, that search engine loves to be scraped, loves the attention. And you get pretty much get the same results
supposing that i'm trying to solve a crossword with horizontal and vertical hints, how do i go about doing that
If you don't mind me asking what libraries did you have to import for this to work?
Link to GitHub: [https://github.com/facebookresearch/pyrobot](https://github.com/facebookresearch/pyrobot)
Kind of makes sense, but haven't Google and Amazon done studies that even a few milliseconds makes a difference between a click or a purchase?
Neat, thanks!
Why using celery and not something like [Bonobo](https://www.bonobo-project.org/)?
Facebook and Zuckerberg can keep it, don’t want anything from that evil little man.

Pygame, sys
Good point. My thoughts were along the lines that both classes should be independent. `SIR` can contain initial conditions and be solved by some other solver class. You are also able to change initial conditions in `ODESolver` without creating a new instance. Additionally, the problem to be solved does not necessarily need to be a class instance but can be any callable, requiring a way to provide initial conditions. I concede that there might be better ways to do it than what I did.
Great idea, I’ll put that in the next update.
that seems like a bug, minimal case: np.array([1, 'a']).dtype, np.array(['a', 1]).dtype
This sounds really boring compared to everyone else but ive only just started python so im making hangman
I used PySimpleGUI. It basically just abstracts the tkinter GUI building, makes quick and easy windows in just a few lines of code. I really liked it. And as a bonus, they have what they call a 'cookbook' of premade windows that you can drop into your code and tweak a bit to match your needs. Really convenient.
Very nice! Next time if you want to skip the "cellphone recording a screen" thing, you can try [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/) (It's free/open source). It's fairly simple to [record your screen](https://www.techradar.com/how-to/how-to-record-your-pc-or-macs-screen).
The `if` statement in many other languages works in terms of booleans, but not Python’s. In Python everything is an object and **all objects declare their truthiness**. If you give an `if` statement `True` it will ask `True` what it’s truth value is, and if you give it `[1, 2, 3]` it will ask `[1, 2, 3]` what its truth value is. It doesn’t matter what the object is, `if` asks for truthiness always, and booleans are out of the picture. &gt; … the new duck typing says, “well it said it was a duck and that’s good enough for me” —Raymond Hettinger, *What Makes Python Awesome Keynote*
That's actually exactly what I'm doing right now! I can't trust my colleagues to try to run a python script so I'm doing it in a browser so they can't mess it up.
I know what I'm learning next, thanks!
This really cool website - stats are relevant and interesting, keywords more or less match for my username and it was interesting to see what my best/worst posts were.
Thank you...will surely try it
Like he said... Pygame en sys
That's not right, I just tried to register for just the free tier trial and it did ask me.
Thanks mate..means a lot
Thank you 😁
Where can we see this code ? Is it hosted in GitHub ?
Yes. Although the product that i lead is generating millions of revenue, i resigned due to politics. New manager came in with no background in software (his background is in hardware design), changed the methodology from agile to waterfall. He is bad mouthing agile and told us it doesn't fit our organization. When the manager learned i have certification in agile and I'm an advocate of agile, the way i was treated is very different from the rest of the engineer. Everybody who bowed to him are treated very well. I tendered my resignation. I was promised to be given a good position. Stayed and instead promoted two guys with no experience in unit testing, architecture design, object oriented design, nor design patterns to a software architect position. I worked closely with these guys and It is not that i envy them and I'm happy for them, but it is a dangerous promotion looking on the company level because you are placing people without knowing their full capabilities on a very sensitive position. On top of that, the manager won't know since his background is in hardware.
Mind Sharing the source code?
https://github.com/cyrus303/Alien-Invation Here you go.
It looks like when you start the array with an integer, it chooses a `&lt;U11` datatype, otherwise it's the length of the longest string: My best guess for why it's `&lt;U11` is that it's trying to size the array so that it could hold the string representation of the most negative 32 bit integer:
Hey i literally just installed pygame to start this project yesterday. It felt so good to be done with those first eleven chapters. Congrats on finishing it!
I've no opinion on the methodology used for development, as it depends on the organization and the project. But I've never seen it work when something is bruteforced on people used to X instead of Y. I don't know the circumstances, obviously, but shit, sounds like a nightmare you have to put up with. Best of luck.
It was a PHP job. I made my own blog with PHP and that was pretty much it. I learned A LOT on the job. It was a contracting gig for some guy selling sites from his home. So maybe not the best example. But I’d say just build your own stuff and don’t think you have to know everything before applying to places.
Thank you and Ya it does.... 2nd project is interesting as well do try it
I found this library while Google for keyword extraction with `nltk` https://github.com/csurfer/rake-nltk
Very new to Python, my first project is automating database comparison across 4 environments.
Thanks for the input. I’m looking more for something I can use on the sentence level instead of a whole section of text. I want to have one image per sentence.
Can you please send me the link
two seconds is rather long. But what is there was a slight delay, like 0.5 seconds. Most people wouldn't have a problem with that. In a class project a while back I was tasked to call an api to give a random Chuck Norris fact. Because the instructor wanted to have us output a greeting before giving the first fact, I debated whether there should be a slight delay in printing the greeting and then outputting the fact. Alternatively printing the fact and waiting slightly before asking if they want an additional fact. I feel like they have their place if not abused.
I was about to suggest this. I cant wait until I can link my rep.it to github.
I was about to suggest this. I cant wait until I can link my rep.it to github.
So I have no clue if this actually solves it, but can you try actually passing the --new-semantic-analyzer option? Otherwise you're still on the old one for now. Failing that, you could maybe try attrs/dataclasses.
Learning more Python for data engineering purposes... It's so useable, I live Pandas.
You're missing the images folder in the repo.
Oh shoot I LL add it first thing in the morning.. Or else You can try https://pixabay.com
You should add ability to go up and down as well as make sure ship should not disappear on top or bottom.
Thanks! Do you use the pro version as well or is the free version good enough to begin with?
thanks!
Tats a very good idea... I am gonna work on that, thank you
You need to some more research on NLTK. Here some links to get you going. Use NLTK to split text into sentences - [https://pythonspot.com/tokenizing-words-and-sentences-with-nltk/](https://pythonspot.com/tokenizing-words-and-sentences-with-nltk/) Use NLTK to tag words with parts of speech - [https://pythonspot.com/nltk-speech-tagging/](https://pythonspot.com/nltk-speech-tagging/) You probably will need to read some of the other NLTK tutorials at Python Spot (e.g. stemming and stop words). I found these tutorials after doing one or two simple searches.
Coding: impressive Shooting though...
Also see 2.4 in the NLTK book - [https://www.nltk.org/book/ch05.html](https://www.nltk.org/book/ch05.html)
Oh, I didn't see that you have to use the new option. Alas, it still is not working: `error: Cannot resolve name "Node" (possible cyclic definition)`. Not a big deal b/c you can still use dataclasses and other things. It's just interesting that this one specific case doesn't work.
Thanks for the heads up!
To be fair, he was probably using one hand to record so he would only be able to play with one hand
Will do. Planning on finishing out the book.
Hmmmm seems unlikely. You may have to scrap cricinfo or the like.
It’s not really what I’m looking for. I want something more meaningful than just taking the nouns of a sentence. Thanks for the input though, looks like I’ll have to do more research.
Sure, You can start here: [Everything you need to know BEFORE learning how to code.](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpclOk10VM7gIWyirriII1z4Z7Y-u344n) Or skip it and go right for the first Tutorial: [The Basics of Python.](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpclOk10VM7inp3AmpFHMDyEJ1RZeleF8) Next part is out in a few days.
One of the best approches to Python or coding in general, imho. This book is amazing.
[removed]
Another option is to just use the [existing LaTeX support with Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/users/usetex.html).
Thank you! I'm still actively working on it! Trying to incorporate some new metrics and of course, bug fixes lol
For interested how it works: * Repeat 50k times: * While ray of random wavelength is not touching borders: * Check coordinates, if there's black pixel, draw a pixel of color (calculated from HSV value where H is random value from 0-270° and V is calculated based on Gaussian distribution \[I made approximation of human's eye color reception\]), else calculate index of refraction based on initial angle of ray and wavelength * Calculate next (x, y) position from sin and cos of angle and distance traveled * If ray hit the border, remember path of the ray and clear the canvas * After 50k samples, take an average of each pixel value and save to file

Ur welcome, thoses type of projects are awesome to learn programming
It's actually "code cademy (codecademy.com)", but luckily they have the "code academy" domain too since this confuses a lot of people
Thank you for your time and knowledge!I really appreciate that, i mean it. &amp;#x200B; I'm actually located in BR though, but thats not a problem these days. Knowing a bit of english has allowed me to land some jobs lol. &amp;#x200B; As someone whos skilled in programming and had an extensive career as an artist, have you ever produced any solo game projects?
Thanks. I appreciate it
What do you mean it didn’t work?
Well done :)
Nice! I haven’t tried out tinkter yet but might, I’m using Java right now for making projects. Is tinkter hard to learn?
The game is in french: "Lancer" mean start, "quitter" mean quit, "retour" mean go back, and the rest is the same as in english. It was the project I had to do for the last year of highschool, we were a team of 3 but I made 100% of the code. Its a bit clunky, sadly. If anyone is interested, I might post the code later...
The Python interpreter always runs in a single process, though within that process there can be multiple threads of control. They’ll all work on one processor core though. If you want to leverage more than one core you can use the **multiprocessing** module, but no it’s not used by any IDE / REPL I’m aware of.
Thanks! Tkinter is really simple, but its not optimal for games. Pygame would have been a better choice, but its also harder to learn. How's Java? Never tried it!
Its not a python library that will get you datasets. I just googled cricket datasets and it provided quite a few interesting leads. Use a library like Pandas to actually analyze the datasets you find.
Thanks, I was not aware of that. So my issue should be rooted somewhere else: The nest-simulator is actually a standalone program where python is only the interface, for some reason this program can access all CPU resources on one machine but is very limited on another.
I’m not sure if this constitutes creativity, but the first thing that came to mind was checking implicit string types: `version = 2 if type(b'string') == str else 3`.
Nice work bud!!!
Atom is OK if you're just working on a single file script, but for anything more complicated you'll want to check out something like pycharm.
I am working on a program to make mass revisions to our older g-code files.
What? My job is a GCP shop. I assure you tax information is not required.
Unfortunately I can’t say, you’ve got too many moving parts. Sounds like Anaconda and Homebrew are somehow configuring the builds differently, but the where and why could come down to a simple switch based on OS version or any number of other things. Have you tried recreating your Anaconda install on the machine with newer OS and ensuring as few variables as possible?
Wasn’t executing the program even though I followed each and every step. Don’t remember the exact error which was displayed though.
Okay, thanks
One of my stupid petpieves is when people say Code A cademy. It literally doesn't matter and nobody actually cares but it's just the fact that people refuse to see there is no a in the middle haha.
Java is definitely easier for games (don’t have to install 10 different modules haha). It’s annoying at first, you have to use parentheses around everything and semicolons (for ex, if x == y: turns into if (x == y) { }). It does have classes which make things like having multiple projectiles super easy, and processing has an extensive reference sheet and some examples and tutorials. Once you get past all the extra steps it becomes much easier to get the hang of.
Freakin awesome! Reminds me of when I self taught learning Basic back in ye old days. Can you modify the code to speed up the alien movements as their #'s decrease? :)
I'm learning Java and I just feel like this kind of stuff would be so much more appealing to employers than the general java/xml/spring project stuff.

Repl.it has a decent course but not ideal. Much more hands on and it is free. Be weary some levels are extremely difficult for some reason.
Ok - I’m not sure. Anyway, along with PyCharm, another good contender is Visual Studio Code. It’s free as well and has the features you’ll expect. Hope this helps and have fun learning!
Pro version is worth the money. But you can still learn python 2 for free.
How is your code supposed to make use of your multiple cores? You have to know this. If it uses openmp you must [setup it up](https://software.intel.com/en-us/mkl-windows-developer-guide-setting-the-number-of-threads-using-an-openmp-environment-variable). Same goes for OpenBLAS or mkl.
Oh cool! Thanks for the suggestion on the Learn Python in Y Minutes. Cool site.

Ah, this reminds me of when I first learned how to code, in high school in 1981. We had two Commador PET PCs that we were learning to code in BASIC. We also had a copy of Space Invaders that we could play on the PETs. At that time, the only other way to play that games was at an arcade and you had to pay for it. So, we thought is was so cool that we could play Space Invaders as much as we wanted for free. Good times. :)

PyCharm is my go-to Python IDE. It can be pretty overwhelming at first if you have never used a full blown IDE before but it has so many great features. VS Code is my go-to text editor.
Thanks but i was looking for more of videos with subtitle or someome signing.

I’m just getting to the middle of this book now
You’ll get punted to r/learnpython But, do what ever will keep you interested. Maybe there is a task you do regularly you want to automated. Or you want to turn your smart lights on from your computer?
I like Seaborn - it offers a high-level interface while combining matplotlib’s plotting functions and some basic algorithms like hierarchical clustering from scipy. And obviously, if you wanted further customization, you could mess with the underlying matplotlib code.
I am trying to predict what kind of music relaxes patients with Parkinson. And whether has more effect an auto generated music or a song chosen by the patient. The dataset sucks, as usual.
I just found the solution: OpenMP has to be activated by choosing a build version of the nest-simulator that has OpenMP already included. You can not activate it later inside the environment. Thanks for your help!
I just found out the solution. The OpenMP is handled by the simulation software itself, but it has to be activated by choosing the correct build version during installation. It uses the OpenMP installation within the nest env, but can't be assigned to it after installation.
Did you use the turtle module for this? Looks interesting.
Looks awesome! I’m in the process of doing that same project within the book! I changed my ship a bit and I’m trying to draw my own alien ships just to change it to my liking.
It's not obvious to me why the rays are scattering. Can you explain these steps in a little more detail?
Something that's popular on gaming subreddits is a daily Q&amp;A post that's posted by automod and stickied. All the questions go there and the subreddit veterans answer questions there when they're up for it. The flair stuff is pretty cool but it's hard to filter out or search for on mobile.
That's awesome. How did you approach it?
PyCharm or JupyterNotebook
