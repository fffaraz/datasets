Totally agree.
Yeah I use vscode with pylama which catches everything, but I'd rather write less stupid things for the winter to catch!
[removed]
Oh thank God from some of the replies here I was feeling like the only forgetful Python coder in the world!
I considered adding forgetting parentheses to my stupid things list, but I decided it's really not that stupid, Python is full of methods that are named like attributes and vice versa so it's very understandable to make that mistake I very rarely iterate over keys either, the only thing I do is if key in mydict sometimes, if I'm doing some logic where .get() doesn't make sense
I tried that too did not work !
Ah, so in practical terms, things like incompatibilities could arise undetected by either one? Or is it mostly a reproducibility thing?
Incompatibilities can definitely arise, for example if pip tries to install a package that you've already installed with Conda.
Is it good for total beginners? Currently working on the MIT EdX intro to computer science and python programming course. It would be great to take advantage of all the free resources at once!
Ah thanks for the advice - I shall update them this afternoon
python-for-android? https://github.com/kivy/python-for-android/ I know it works with kivy but I haven't used it for anything else
What distro?
Grafana has a built in map. I am also giving lat long and plan on using google api to help.

For those that were confused like me by the headline, the article actually discusses optimizing queries using indexes, in the context of a django application. Django will NOT optimize your queries for you.
That's not "differentiate(d) from all the other datatypes?", it doesn't round-trip. And why would a hex representation be better than a base32 or base64 one, or 4 32-bit integers, or an object holding all the relevant UUID fields separately? Meanwhile serialising UUIDs however *you* want / need them to be takes all of 3 lines: def stringifier(obj): if isinstance(obj, uuid.UUID): return str(uuid) raise TypeError() blam, just pass that as the `default` argument of your json.dumps.
Yes
Linux isn't a distro. Amazon Linux 2? Ubuntu 16? Centos 7?
Yeah I’d say so. They explain how to install and what everything does and jumps into the algebra you’ll need to start while using python and breaks down “why” after the show you something.
We use the form to gauge experience, and we'll balance the teams accordingly.

Getting a Python Programming job without a CS or strong Python background is very hard. Using Python to boost your resume in your field is very very easy. For instance, being able to use Python to scrape websites to create data sets in your Masters courses is a very easy way to give yourself unique vantages for class or for wider publication which will help burnish your resume and let you stand out. And once you start doing that that will give you a leg up in time and performance over other people which will always help you if you use it right.
Thank you man, I wouldn't have seen this without you "reposting" it
Grow a pair and just buy it or are you financially dependent on your girlfriend?
How did you install Python 3? Also, I know its not your question but doing things as the root user is pretty gross and highly insecure. Use sudo. However, keep in mind the sudo user has its own path (usually specified in /etc/sudoers). As the other person said, a simple 'which pip3' will show you the path. If you print out your path - 'echo $PATH' - as root, you need to make sure its in the path. If you tried that and its not working I suspect your something weird is going on with your shell.
Research
Thank you. This is indeed for research and speed and security is not a priority here.
Research of what?
Congrats for starting the learning process! It's a journey. Don't be in any rush and understand it will take years to develop hirable skills (though possible to compress into under a year if you devote your life to it intensively enough). &amp;#x200B; I would suggest checking out /r/learnPython and /r/learnprogramming as better resources than this subreddit

I'm betting that the robot is essentially remote-controlled (they call it RoboMaster Lab), and you can program the *remote* in Scratch (or some block-like language) and in Python, but you aren't uploading code to the robot itself. So every time you do a conditional or something, you'll be sending a request over the network (wifi apparently) to the robot, getting a response, running the if statement on the computer, and sending the resulting command to the robot. A lot more latency, and it could make reactivity hard. For example, imagine you want to do one thing if a sensor is touched, another if it tilts, another if it sees something, another thing if it gets hit: you'll have to run a loop to poll each of those, and the latency will become particularly problematic. They can get around it with higher-level commands, e.g., `move_until_you_hit_something()` or `follow_line()`, but it keeps you from doing novel things. What's more disappointing with the remote control is that you can't make an autonomous robot. *Maybe* if you keep their RoboMaster Lab open (on a tablet) and running a loop.

Then you probably want Scapy or something like that, but keep in mind it will be really slow.
Thank man! Just take it.
I've done the full Sololearn Python course on android and just started this since it's free. He's really good at explaining everything and giving examples. He types really fucking fast in regards to the characters required ():' ect. so I have to pause it but I'm enjoying it so far. After this I have Python 3 The Hard Way lined up.
Thank you!
I started building a webapp with Django after learning python for 2 months. It's very fun, especially because they're plenty library on the open source community that I can use.
I installed python by: yum install python3 And i did not know ‘which’ is a command, lmao. Non-root ‘which pip3’: /usr/bin Root ‘which pip3’: No pip3 in (all the paths....) Root and non-root ‘which python3’: /usr/bin/python3 Installed pip using: ‘curl -O https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py’ And ran : Python3 get-pip.py Shows successfully installed pip 19.x version but pip —version/pip3 —version shows no pip command found
Thank you, this will be a huge help!
I dont think you should have any issues with this, doing some quick searching it looks like you could use [PyPDF2](https://github.com/mstamy2/PyPDF2) to add images to your PDF by page number. I have used [python-barcode](https://github.com/WhyNotHugo/python-barcode) module to create barcodes before, which can be saved out as various filetypes. Then there are a few module for working with excel (to read off your data) but I have always used [openpyxl](https://openpyxl.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). Just read your data in, loop over it, creating your barcode, save it (or maybe you can utilize it without saving.. not sure here) and then access your PDF by the page number and apply the image as an overlay.
I've been using PyQt for my latest GUIs because most of them don't require fancy Js stuff and I still can customize it via a sort of CSS. Also the PyQt Designer program allows for quick layout, but it doesn't come with the latest pip of PyQt5 so you'll have to install it separately which probably isn't super stable. The only things that really bother me are the responsiveness and relative measurements, because it's extremely difficult to build something nice like you're used to in modern Webdesign. For that sake, the flask app really is a very good option, thanks for sharing! Edit: Typo.
Yes
bro i just bought a book core Python programming but doesnt have these programs but have all other functions like arrays,input output,files,networking, GUI? so that will be okay for me as a beginner?

&gt;This course is made for complete beginners who have no experience programming. It's "programming for office workers" because it skips computer science and teaches you how to do practical tasks: web scraping, updating Excel spreadsheets, parsing PDFs and Word documents, sending out automated email and text notifications, controlling the mouse and keyboard, and more. If you're an experienced programming, you can skip the first half (which covers basic programming concepts) and directly learn about several useful modules for Python. &amp;#x200B; From the instructor/author Al Sweigart
r/learnpython might be a better place to ask.

Thanks
Thanks
Thank you!
It was literally on the top of the sub too so maybe try doin a little research on your own
Did you learn something over those 3 months? Did it help you improve your coding skills and learn the language better? Then who gives a damn if it's 5 minutes or 5 hours long. If you're doing something in your off time that's helping you improve. Then even if it's a single step, it's in the right direction.
Thanks man. I learned a lot in these 3 months, but sadly we won't use python anymore next grade. We will use Java
How is this course for people who know programming fundamentals pretty well? Too basic?
/u/pr00ffreader, when you say you don’t use REPL or ipython to code, how do you code? Developing using small snippets of code at a time in these cells (actually in PyCharm’s REPL) is how I work. What else do you do? Why would this be better?
!remindme 30 days
So, I just did 2 classes on C#...now I'm in C++...next is Java...I took one class on Python years ago and now it's my favorite language. Fundamentals are still the same in how a program can be structured, and a great example of this is Operators. Take a look here----- [https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python\_basic\_operators.htm](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_basic_operators.htm) Now...C#------ [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/operators/index](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/operators/index) There are syntax similarities within many programming languages such as things needing to be encapsulated (&lt;Insert\_Cool\_Thing\_Here) or another example is if/else statements....they fundamentally work the same across languages...they just may be written a bit differently.
5 minutes long?!?! Holy shit that's impressive. I worked for like 2 months to make a simple game that lasts for like 10 seconds. Not even a start menu; you just jump right into it.
Zoom in where exactly? Can you post a screenshot?
Does it have to be flask? Would this work with, say, Bottle? Django? etc? What about the framework is flask specific?
I really wish I could run a python webapp locally on my phone! It would make things so much easier!

thank u so much!!!
python is great for personal projects though.
I generally write entire .py files at a time in vs code, with proper modularization so they don't each get too big, lint them in the IDE and then use the interactive debugger. I usually have a repl open so I can dir() something or things like that, but I don't write functions in it.
Online courses might be best for you to get started. Start with the basic Python, plenty of python jobs are in Data science, Machine learning and Web. Based on your preference, do your course on any of those fields. PS: Since you have a background in ECE, you may also try Micropython for embedded devices. Not sure about the Industry adoption and jobs in this particular area.
I actually bought your ebook and I think it is awesome that you are offering this course for free. This is going to help so much, thank you!

/r/learnpython and read the sidebar Note that programming is not an exercise in copying and pasting, it is an exercise in problem solving.
Maintaining the separation between pip and conda in an environment.yml config script would be helpful imho.
I wouldn't say it's **necessarily** easier, but it can be. A lot of it depends on what kind of work you do and what exactly we mean by "remote". For example, some places that would classify as remote require you to come into the office for meetings but if you're not wanting to do that then you eliminate a lot of jobs. Regardless of that, remote jobs are available and it's not exactly hard to get them and if you're particularly concerned with ageism, remote jobs help with that. I do freelance work nowadays and none of the developers I work with have any idea how old I am. The only people who know this info are HR.
It should be a .bat file in windows.

I did this years ago for a few years in my computer science courses in highschool and we did the same; new language each year and learned the basics concepts over the term to eventually bring everything together in a game. One year I remade a version of galaza and the other was a simple top-down RPG. Don't let the lessons you learned go unnoticed even though the finished project doesn't seem grandiose, those core concepts can only be used more efficiently as you move to java because your brain will have those problem solving gears turning. Best of luck next year, sir!

Watson &amp; Crick’s paper on DNA was a page and a half, very unassuming in its title, and the Nobel-prize winning work of one of the greatest discoveries in science history; a molecular basis for heredity. Don’t judge work by its length. Also I expect you to win a Nobel prize. No pressure. :) https://www.nature.com/articles/171737a0 https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_Structure_of_Nucleic_Acids:_A_Structure_for_Deoxyribose_Nucleic_Acid
**Molecular Structure of Nucleic Acids: A Structure for Deoxyribose Nucleic Acid** "Molecular Structure of Nucleic Acids: A Structure for Deoxyribose Nucleic Acid" was the first article published to describe the discovery of the double helix structure of DNA, using X-ray diffraction and the mathematics of a helix transform. It was published by Francis Crick and James D. Watson in the scientific journal Nature on pages 737–738 of its 171st volume (dated 25 April 1953). This article is often termed a "pearl" of science because it is brief and contains the answer to a fundamental mystery about living organisms. This mystery was the question of how it is possible that genetic instructions are held inside organisms and how they are passed from generation to generation. *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Python/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28
Good programmers don't let school guide their progress. Your best learning will be extra-curricular. If you enjoy Python, stick with it outside of school hours alongside the Java they teach you. &amp;#x200B; I'm sure you're not going down this road, but one of the hard exclusions I have for hiring developers is them saying that they only program in language X.
I've continued working on my script to download and re-order playlists from YouTube. Based on this now working script, I've created a few off-shoots to download all the metadata for videos in a playlist and store it in a csv file, among other data admin jobs.
Thank you. Just PMed you now.
There is some good info on here, but does anyone recommend a good book that I can get from Amazon to use in conjunction with the online information provided?
You can always skip ahead to the more advanced sections
I'd say too basic. It's about making scripted behavior. I read the book yo learn how to do one line scripts for sysadmin work.
It's just a example of application. What is better than this target?
This is a pretty good beginner course. Awesome that Al is offering it up for free.

It's better to sign in the course now, since the coupon is only valid during this week.
Thanks for the book and vid tuts
I’ve always found it annoying, but that’s probably because I don’t do it very often
This was on my buy list so thanks for the heads up
Thanks very much for sharing this
Damn useful and so clear. Well worth a read.
You don't need a degree but you should able to show you have the basic competency for whatever kind of job you are seeking if you advertise Python knowledge on your LinkedIn or resume. I would start by learning the basic Python statements/syntax/functions like you are doing, then identify what kind of job you are most interested in and focus on the learning the libraries that will be most helpful for facilitating that kind of work. Maybe after that try a few personal projects or challenges.

Fuck yeah I'm stupid
should be fixed
* "Java, Clojure/Script and Python" are all heavy VM-based languages. Nim produces lean and fast executables that are nearly indistinguishable from those written in C/C++. If you write a tool in Nim, it's likely to be &lt;1MB without any additional run-time dependencies. * Java has a very verbose syntax and forces OOP boilerplate even when it's a disadvantage. Nim is far briefer, has syntax closer to Python, and has powerful metaprogramming features to eliminate boilerplate. * Desktop applications written in Java are noticeably slower, especially to start up, than those written in C/C++ or Nim. * When hosting server-side API code, RAM is very likely to be the cost bottleneck. The JVM uses drastically more RAM than native code like Nim (especially with optional manual memory management). * Also, the JVM is very legally encumbered, while Nim is 100% [copyfree](http://copyfree.org).

That doesn't pertain to this conversation, but it is. It was pushed by a [far-left extremist](https://stallman.org). It attacks the free market through government force. And so the choice of licensing has now become a form of political signaling. Facts don't care about your feelings, or your childish downvote tantrums.
The Python code has to be translated into machine code instructions somehow. Either that happens on their machine, in which case they need Python running on their machine (either installed directly or via a packaging tool like PyInstaller or Py 2 EXE), or compiles to machine code on your machine and then sent across (although I’m not aware of any tooling that does this) The only potential gap in the cases you present would be the word “installed”—could they run a Python interpreter without having Python installed? I’ve never used it, but I believe [Pyodide](https://github.com/iodide-project/pyodide) would do that—it runs a Python interpreter compiled to WebAssembly, so it can load in a browser window and run a Python interpreter on their machine without installing it.
Still much slower than Nim.

Just go read Fluent Python or Serious Python. Instagram probably has high quality onboarding but they are basically the cream of the crop, good luck getting in. I find there to be a lack of entry-level python positions in general but maybe that's just my area.
Wow thanks a lot for the very detailed post! &amp;#x200B; &gt;"Java, Clojure/Script and Python" are all heavy VM-based languages I do totally agree with you for Java and Clojure but what about Python? Is it because of the interpreter that you say it is VM based?

Agree &amp;#x200B; &gt;Nim is ... and has powerful metaprogramming features to eliminate boilerplate. But so does Clojure but maybe it's not the same idea behind metaprogramming in Nim and language of the Lisp family? &amp;#x200B; &gt;Desktop applications written in Java are noticeably slower, especially to start up, than those written in C/C++ or Nim. I think I agree with the startup being slower in Java but I thought that for long running Java applications they were very performant. Is this still not true compared with C++/Nim? &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; Thanks again for your thoughts and for making me aware of copyfree, I need to look deeper on this subject.
What an odd, aggressive response when you’re in a position of advocacy. I thought it odd and a little off-putting when you said the GPL was a commie license, but this is next-level. If this is the kind of outreach the Nim community engages in, I’m not sure I’m interested in looking into it further. As a counter-example, Steve Klabnik has done fantastic work for the Rust community, being cheerleader, advocate, teacher, and genuinely kind host to all manner of folks and opinions. If he had responded as you have, I greatly doubt Rust would be where it is today.
I actually have the same question, I'm doing my bachelor's in a medical subject but I realized that I love coding and I'm learning to do so from the past year. How do I actually get job in the industry? I have no contacts or connections right now so we can rule that out as a possibility right now.
Why delete this man? I was just about to congratulate you
Thanks a lot for the share, signed up!!
Check out [CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/welcome-to-circuitpython/overview)! The documentation is superb and doesn't assume any prior programming experience. You only need a compatible ($15+) Adafruit microcontroller. In theory, all programming languages are capable of programming electronics, but what's neat about CircuitPython is the ability to program your device interactively in a live terminal session (which is similar to programming in an interactive Python shell, but it's modified to communicate over a serial port and runs on the FPGA directly). There's nothing comparable to that in Java or C++!
Pex is an option: https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex
I'm pretty satisfied with it! And I think it'll be fun to pour over the data after a little while once it's had time to accumulate a big wall of news
Thanks. I'm not looking for cream of the crop, I'm just looking for a career starting point to build good habits...
Judging a whole group (Nim programmers) based on a single random sample (me, from some totally different thread) is very narrow-minded. I can assure you that most Nim programmers hate me just as much as you do. 😁
It is always free on their website in case someone missed it. Great for beginners and more experienced programmers!~
gotcha scumbag!
&gt; I do totally agree with you for Java and Clojure but what about Python? Is it because of the interpreter that you say it is VM based? Pedantically speaking, Python is a language with implementations like [CPython](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPython), [PyPy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PyPy), [Stackless](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stackless_Python), [MicroPython](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroPython), [Jython](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jython), [IronPython](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IronPython), etc. Some of those definitely run on a VM, while with others the terminology is debatable. You can [read more about CPython's stack-based "VM" here](http://muattiyah.com/posts/python-internals-cpython-bytecode/). My main point was that they're heavy in terms of run-time requirements. If you're using chroot / jails / containers, then your Nim microservice would be a single tiny executable compared to requiring all dependencies for Python or JVM. I believe that the Unix desktop is becoming bloated, because everyone is using their favorite scripting language with a heavy run-time: one program is written in NodeJS, another in Python, a third in Java, C#, Ruby, Tcl, Lua, Lisp, Erlang, Haskell, etc. It's much leaner if everything is written in languages that produce lean native binaries, like C/C++, Pascal, Rust, D, or Nim. &gt; I think I agree with the startup being slower in Java but I thought that for long running Java applications they were very performant. Is this still not true compared with C++/Nim? Rust now beats Java across the board in the [latest TechEmpower Web Framework benchmarks](https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=test&amp;runid=9271e861-10e9-48b8-8a66-6e9d6582ffb9). This is despite the fact that those benchmarks run with HUGE amounts of RAM, which only VM-based languages make use of, so Java would run much slower on a cheaper VPS. The same is also true for [energy use on mobile devices](https://thenewstack.io/which-programming-languages-use-the-least-electricity/): the mobile JVM is very well optimized, but still uses about twice as much as Rust. The main difference between Rust and D/Nim is that Rust specializes in manual memory management by default, while D/Nim uses garbage collection by default, but can be set to manage memory manually, which should make them about equally performant. Nim also has the added advantage of being able to use any optimizing C backend (ex. Intel C++), which on some platforms can produce better optimizations than LLVM or GCC, and thus beat out D and Rust.
THANK YOU!
Aw man! I just bought the Udemy version last month. Great course though. Highly recommended.
Short answer: nope. Longer answer: You said no py2exe, and I took that to mean no cx_freeze, nuitka, pyinstaller, etc. Each of these byte-compiles the Python package, like py2exe, one way or another. If you're not willing to compile the code ahead of time, then you need an interpreter to compile it at runtime. That interpreter is variously named "Python".
Love me a useful command line interface
I see. How do you think I should go about mentioning testpypi? Just drop a link there?
For a single entry point yes, otherwise no. I really like the entry\_points. It tells you on install what it installed, so read that list and check them out. Also, the documentation should tell you about those entry\_points.
http://lmgtfy.com/?q=python+speech+recognition
Thank you, helped me out big time :-)
Thanks for posting this, I was about a quarter of the way into your book and now I'm excited to take the course covering it! I would never have known it was available if not for this reddit post.
Yay I can type 3 words instead of 1! And I can make sure that when I `pip install` the package, I have to go digging through the environment's site packages to find the executable every time! `__main__.py` is a thing, but it's not good for anything except maybe quick prototyping.
I love Python, but the whole dunder idea seems poorly conceived .
Just enrolled in the course myself and I can say I am excited to check it out! I have had good luck with udemy courses in the past, and this one being free was too good not to test out. I enjoy using python to make cool little productivity scripts so hopefully this will give some good ideas.
Thank you again for you thoughtful response, definitely helpful! You make it hard for me not to try Nim soon ;)
Cx_Freeze. This is a compiler which makes an .exe.
Good job man! I'm currently learning to master python and I just started my own project. I plan to transfer the software packages xfoil and avl into python, then into cython, and finally into julia. I have to learn git sometime this weekend so I can be more efficient at working from different locations and such. I just finished making my first few classes ever and I see now how powerful OOP is.
Its a nasty fucking language.
This is awesome, thanks.
Looks cool! I browsed the code real quickly, the usage of globals looks a little shady. I'm not quite sure what you are attempting to accomplish with the vars cause I only took a quick look but if you need synchronized access you should look into using locks or other thread-safe ways of sharing variables between threads.
I hate to recommend an entire tool, but vscode makes debugging tests stupidly simple. You'll get a little hover over the test method that says run test/debug test and you can set breakpoints and step through with a nifty little locals/watch/stack pane. Would highly recommend. Otherwise you can use direct pdb commands like @thearc31 mentioned.
Great notes. Congrats!

I think it will be very hard to find what you're looking for. Most companies expect junior devs to hit the ground running.
Go through the official Python tutorial. Two weeks is probably not enough time but you can also try working through Think Python 2ed.
Pretty sure there's a traceback error in there somewhere...
Did you define your variables as a string or an integer?
now where you coding??
r/learnpython
I have found __main__.py useful for creating a CLI for a package, not just prototypes.
something isn't right here. in your code it says `"enter guess"` but in your program output it's asking `"enter the guess"`.
typecast input to str
Well, you could make a better CLI for that package if you used entry points instead. What, in your opinion, makes `__main__.py` superior?
Python buddy
Any particular website you could recommend for learning? I think I am interested in all three of those fields you mentioned o.o
You have guess = “” which means nothing, and will cause an error can say guess = “ “ //added a space
Try for x in range(df.shape[0], df.shape[0]+no_of_duplicates): df.loc[x] = df.loc[row_of_interest_index]
Are you using Python 2? If so it’s raw_input. If you’re using Python 3, run your program using the command python3 instead of plain python
No
Same!
Yes
Wow cool 80's feel. Care to share the source? :-)
Thank you for sharing. Just signed up!
Love your book, I’ve worn out the binding from use (seriously it’s a well made book, I’ve just spent a lot of time with it). I look forward to the Udemy course!
I love you both
Jeezus! Im just starting out and I alrdy finished college. This is impressive! How long did it take you? How did you get started? What program did you use?
I started maybe 3-4 months ago. I have been coding for maybe two years and this is my second major project (I made a similar monopoly game last year) I used sublime text for the code and got much of my data from Pokemondb.net with some formatting using excel
Shoot my bad I've been learning C# recently lol
Thanks let me try
Learn to use Git version control (check some tutorial, not that difficult) and put your development efforts into Github. Once you get a bit older you will have a nice portfolio of software to showcase when you apply for jobs. You might even get some job offers through your releases without applying anywhere. And keep programming! Always interesting challenges, always new interesting things to learn, great job prospects and good salaries. &amp;#x200B; About the project itself: Some random thoughts while browsing the code: * You could separate data more from code, and make the software more data-driven * You have a lot of repeating patterns (aka copy-paste), you could for example refactor input parsing / command processing * You should follow Python PEP8 style guide (e.g. no def PokemonBattle() but def pokemon\_battle() etc) * But overall, looks pretty good!
Sorry, I didn't have time to clearly comment and explain all the stuff, but here's the code: [https://github.com/8BitToaster/Weird-Visual-Generation.git](https://github.com/8BitToaster/Weird-Visual-Generation.git)
Create another df by filtering your original df to the rows you want to copy, and then append the df of copies rows back to the original.
I hate executing programs with a -m flag on the interpreter. That is a Python special-case. I hate special cases. Sometimes special cases are needed. I understand that. But it doesn't mean I don't hate them. I prefer chmod +x because it is the exact same way every other program is executed. To further elaborate on what I hate about this method for executing modules: Modules shouldn't be executable at all. They're modules. If you want an executable command line interface to your module, create a script and import the module. It's an API like any other. Python even has its own directory for command-line Python scripts on Windows: C:\\Python3X\\Scripts. You don't need multiple files for an executable unless there are multiple executables. If you do need multiple files, it should be in the damn module anyway. Put it where it belongs. Modules are modules. They're not executables.
He probably forgot compiling it first
Probably I’ll explain it in a better way.. I have rows like this.. Id item total qty. vehicle qty 1. X. 50 25 I need this total 50 qty divided into 2 rows Id item total qty vehicle qty 1. X 25 25 2. X 25 25
Thanks! It was fun figuring out how to parse XML in the process of writing this :p
Not python, but ImageMagick's [montage command](http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/montage/) could be what you're looking for, packs all image together with plenty of options to customize with. If you wanted to integrate it into your program you can always: from subprocess import call call("montage...", shell=True)
keep playing with the hertz you just got to find the right frequency, and you'll be causing seizures all over the internet... brighter colours will help too.
It’s not straightforward but I’ll be writing a blogpost soon to explain the process in the simplest way possible :)
Python is inherently a single-threaded language

you know that enumerate should be barely used ?, for i in range(n), also should not that frequently used.
I agree. Entry points also create executables and not a python file, which allows you to have multiple CLIs.

Multiprocessing for an IO bound workload?

What do you mean, "No"? u/Protoss_Pylon is absolutely correct: the code that u/pmelo93 said they ran, and the code they *actually* ran, are not the same. The difference in this case *might* be trivial, or it might hide other, significant changes.

Because threads have way less overhead. To parallelize CPU bound tasks you need multiprocessing (or C modules that release the GIL while doing work) because the GIL would limit CPython to a single CPU core. For IO bound tasks the GIL is not an issue. The GIL is released during blocking IO operations. Threads should be the default as long as you do not hit the CPU limit. It's helpful to understand the difference anyway.
Thank you
Dope I love it
You are right, it's kind of cool
Thank you! i think that [ Programs and data are the same. ] was meaningful / interesting in the 1st 10 years of LISP, and it's irrelevant in the "real" programs. pls see: https://old.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/c01rbw/i_wrote_a_program_to_get_the_list_of_all_4x4/ pls see: https://old.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/c01ljd/permutation_program_perm2_12_21_perm3_123_213_312/ the latter includes a real example of Python code with a Lisp accent.
it's right, i'm learning python 2, i just import this code to practice
&gt; Yay I can type 3 words instead of 1! Wot? Your objection makes no sense to me. u/Zeevo is right: `__main__.py` is **the** officially supported way to make packages runnable from the command line. This is how you call a Python package from the command line or a shell script: # watch out, this is subtly broken in ways you may not even notice until they bite you, and eventually they will /usr/bin/python3 direct/path/to/packagename/__init__.py (Or just use python3 if you insist.) And this is how you do it with __main__: /usr/bin/python3 direct/path/to/packagename or if the path is somewhere in your PYTHONPATH, you can do this: /usr/bin/python3 -m packagename

thank for your suggestion, i will try out
my problem has be handled, if you care it you can read above cmt, i readed your opinion, i just used python 2 and i forgot to run it when i fix it.
If you don't want to use `-m`, don't use it. You can always give the full path to the Python script, like most scripting languages. Pro-tip: packages can have any number of entry points if you insist: python3 direct/path/to/mypackage/spam.py python3 direct/path/to/mypackage/eggs.py python3 direct/path/to/mypackage/cheese.py but if you need only one, use `__main__.py`: python3 direct/path/to/mypackage or if it is in your PYTHONPATH you don't need the full path: python3 -m mypackage &gt; I prefer chmod +x because it is the exact same way every other program is executed. chmod doesn't execute programs. If you're referring to setting the execute bit and then calling them directly, that requires setting a hash-bang line, and that doesn't work on Windows. In any case, that's not how "every other" program is executed. &gt; Modules shouldn't be executable at all. That's pure superstition. There are risks when making a single .py file do double-duty as both an importable module and a script, but so long as you understand the risks and what can go wrong, and avoid them, it is perfectly fine to put your importable module and executable script in the same physical file. If your command line script is big and complex, it may make sense to split it out from the importable module; if you have complex requirements to set up the environment, it may make sense to use a shell script wrapper; but especially if your needs are few, insisting on a separate script file because "modules shouldn't be executable" is like insisting that every class goes into its own file, even if it's a three line class. Or insisting that, no matter how large and complex your application, you must cram everything into a single gigantic .py file. &gt; They're modules. The Python interpreter doesn't distinguish between modules and scripts. They're *all* modules. If you want an executable command line interface to your module, create a script and import the module. &gt; You don't need multiple files for an executable unless there are multiple executables. Why should I be forced to collapse the package design that makes sense for my application into a single .py file just because there is a single command-line executable?
&gt; the whole dunder idea seems poorly conceived In what way?
Saw that dude perform when he came to my city. My God dat bass...
Ohh I didn’t know that GIL was released for IO bound tasks. Does this mean that a multi threaded program will work just fine here or probably better than multiprocessing?
Most probably yes. It won't be much faster, as the bottleneck is out of your control anyway, but you'd reduce memory and ipc overhead.
reminds me of win95
Gotcha. Thanks! Also another small doubt. I’m still ambiguous about IO bound and CPU bound tasks. Can you give me one solid example which differentiates them keeping multiprocessing and multithreading in mind?
No. You posted a one-word comment, ["No"](https://old.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/c00fep/i_cant_understand_i_tried_to_fix_it_who_can/eqz8zsb/). I'm asking you, what do you mean "No"?

And if you use entry points, you can do entrypointname and you're done. That's his point.
I personally like [TOML](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml) for configuration files. There's a [very simple parser/writer library for it for Python](https://github.com/uiri/toml), too.

You can have a look at this: https://github.com/SV-97/TUInventory/blob/master/TUInventory/config.py It's something I wrote for my finals project. It allows writing and reading settings with a dict-like-API, automatic typing of the stored values (restricted to builtins iirc - if you want to store other things you may actually want to use a database)

This seems interesting ! However, I don't have any clue how I'm supposed to use it... I'm not really into coding but I'm sure that I can understand the basis. I have installed and tried the command : montage image1.png image2.png image3.png but it show an error... (in french *Spécification de lecteur non valide*)
Code pls
IO bound: Everything that blocks the current thread while not consuming much CPU. For example, reading/writing lots of data from/to disks or sockets, waiting for an external server to process and answer your request, or waiting for user input. If most time is spent blocking on IO and basically waiting, then threads are the way to go. CPU bound: Tasks that mostly consume CPU time, like heavy computations or moving lots of data around in-memory (sorting, scanning, filtering, ...). If you spend most of your time actually doing stuff, and not waiting for anyone else, then the GIL may be a bottleneck and multiprocessing may help utilize more than a single CPU core. But measure first! The tricky part: Libraries like numpy or PIL(LOW) are CPU bound, but also release the GIL while they are doing their job, so they are not affected by the GIL so much. They can utilize multiple cores from multiple threads just fine. This is why using multiprocessing for CPU bound tasks may not always be the best choice either. Another issue is IPC (inter-process communication). If your individual jobs are very short or need a lot of shared state or communication, then the high communication overhead between processes may eat up your multiprocessing benefit, and threads may actually be faster again. Start single-threaded. If that is too slow, parallelize using threads. Most of the time, that is enough. Only if you then see a single CPU hit 100% while the others are idle, try multiprocessing.
God bless you, this is the most useful thing here!
You might be looking for [this book](https://www.amazon.com/Gray-Hat-Python-Programming-Engineers/dp/1593271921).
Why can't you recommend it if it's awesome?
The more practice - the cleaner and shorter the code, this is a fact!
That's a bit expensive lmao
I tried it long time ago (or at least I think it was it), same as many other config libraries. I don't remember what exactly was wrong with that one for me, but I always looked for a lightweight module, that allows setting default values, detects unknown directives (for example if user mistyped a key name) and supports recursive inclusion - a typical configuration stuff. So far I have not found anything that fits these requirements (at once) and I always end up writing my own configuration handler, which is quite simple with Python's text processing functions. People usually choose JSON, HJSON, YAML, TOML or more "pythonic" INI. All of these formats have quite good support in Python. Configuration files can also be processed easily by other tools.
$30 for a programming book is a totally reasonable price.
Well, I have it right now (I won't say how), but I saw that it requires C, really?

In general, web-apps are way more complex to develop than desktop apps (at least for anything beyond the trivial). After two decades of writing complex python GUI apps, I've arrived at Enaml ([https://enaml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/get\_started/introduction.html](https://enaml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/get_started/introduction.html)) as my preferred method. The docs are a little sparse but it's way more pleasant to use than working with a GUI toolkit API directly. However, you can still "drop down" to create your own enaml widgets using PyQt if need be. Also, using the "atom" library for model creation is a real winner.
It's a surprisingly useful tool. You should at least skim the chapter to figure out what it can be applied to, so you can come back to it later. Also, /r/learnpython .
I'll ask Internet god to forgive me
What helped me start to get intuition about coding and the Python syntax was the Codeacademy course : https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python 2 weeks is not too short, it all depends on your motivation.
Ethical hacking is more about knowledge of different ready-to-go tools than programming from scratch. But, anyway, Python is a very popular language for automating tasks and different exploits.

I think the idea is cool but it's an academic exercise. I never had to do this operation in 15 years of python. Generally, when you have to split a string, it happens according to more complex rules. It's very, very rare that you have to split fixed size chunks. &amp;#x200B; Now, splitting a list onto equal pieces... now you might be onto something.

&gt; Now, splitting a list onto equal pieces... now you might be onto something. If you want, we can write a PEP. Sadly the "grouper" recipe exists and maintainers have been oddly reluctant to merge [itertools recipes](https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools-recipes) into itertools itself. more_itertools has both [chunked](https://more-itertools.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api.html#more_itertools.chunked) and [windowed](https://more-itertools.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api.html#more_itertools.windowed) though.

What do you mean by entry points? The first link that comes up https://chriswarrick.com/blog/2014/09/15/python-apps-the-right-way-entry_points-and-scripts/ uses `__main__.py`.
Same! I first made a prototype in flask but I'm moving it to Django now. I added django-rest-framework and django-pytest, loving it so far.
What a wonderful subreddit
Yeah, it was recommended to my when I shared some of my work in the past, and it's probably my favorite sub to visit now.
If you are a beginner, don't study Python 2, but Python 3
Though to add much of the syntax is the same between them. For a beginner it's just useful for them to be learning Python :)

I was studying python 3 but my compiler uses Python 2( didn't realise until you commented that) How do i change it what do I type lol
Thanks
Thanks
s/deactivate/activate/g Insert mode places new character at caret position and moves characters after it forward, the other option, replace mode, changes character at caret position. While insert mode is currently the default for almost everything, the key is called insert, because replace was the default and you would activate the alternative mode from that key. Replace was the original default mode because it worked in same way as typewriters with error correction functionality.
1. Your are missing the ":" 2. You don't really need to use the parenthesis. 3. Use Python 3, there won't be any support for Python 2 after Jan 2020. Have fun learning ;)

What's the reason for the reluctance?
I also like that __main__.py let's you execute eggs and wheels directly from command line without installing them, like: python mypackage.egg Makes really easy to deploy some services.
Can you link to a good write up of entry points? I'm only familiar with `__main__.py` and `python -m` notation but I'm open to trying something new.
I'm glad to hear that!
I guess it's maintenance pressure whereas you can just copy/paste the recipe in your codebase and then you're responsible for it (and can tune it if you need something slightly different than the recipe e.g. itertool's grouper fills the last group if the input is not divisible by the blocksize whereas more_itertool's chunked does not).
This is the official documentation: [https://python-packaging.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command-line-scripts.html#the-console-scripts-entry-point](https://python-packaging.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command-line-scripts.html#the-console-scripts-entry-point) Taking an example from the docs, I will try to explain it. The `console_scripts` will create executables to the "Scripts" folder of your Python installation. It accepts a list of "executable\_name=function" pairs in string format. The example below generates an executable (say on Windows) named `funniest-joke.exe` which actually calls the `main()` function from the module `funniest/command_line.py`. setup( ... entry_points = { 'console_scripts': ['funniest-joke=funniest.command_line:main'], } ... )
You need to include two spaces between lines on reddit, or use 4 spaces before each line, so: import random import time colours = ["Red","Yellow","Green"] while True: print(random.choice(colours)) time.sleep(random.randint(1,10))

Understanding regex will always be useful, but probably in ways that you can't see yet. If it's slowing you down then I would suggest moving on and coming back to regexes down the line because it's likely you won't totally grasp it the first time through anyway. I know a few professional programmers who still avoid regexes like the plague because it doesn't jive with them and they refuse to go back and try again. I myself am still pretty weak on them. Regular expressions will allow you to take your searches to the next level and do some powerful stuff, and they translate across languages, tool sets, and platforms. If your natural distaste for them every changes to an intense curiosity then you know it's time to start studying Theory of Computation so you can see how they're derived and where they come from historically. But to summarize my answer: no, you can skim it then skip it for now and come back whenever you're ready. It's more important that you stay focused on learning Python and some roadblocks are best handled by driving around them and moving on with your life.
While I would agree to putting projects on GitHub in general, putting this one there is just hastening arrival of C&amp;D from Nintendo.
You can get it here which includes instructions: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-370/
Regex and sql are two skills I wish I had more of. Regex is particularly helpful if you do lots of text-based data analysis, or for dealing with lots of files. My favourite use that for me hooked is easily converting American date format `mm/dd/yyyy` to ISO format `yyyy-mm-dd`.

Hi there, from the /r/Python mods. We have removed this post as it is not suited to the /r/Python subreddit proper, however it should be very appropriate for our sister subreddit /r/LearnPython or for the r/Python discord: https://discord.gg/python. The reason for the removal is that /r/Python is dedicated to discussion of Python news, projects, uses and debates. It is not designed to act as Q&amp;A or FAQ board. The regular community is not a fan of "how do I..." questions, so you will not get the best responses over here. On /r/LearnPython the community and the r/Python discord are actively expecting questions and are looking to help. You can expect far more understanding, encouraging and insightful responses over there. **No matter what level of question you have, if you are looking for help with Python, you should get good answers**. Make sure to check out the rules for both places. Warm regards, and best of luck with your Pythoneering!
I think you may be using a specialist meaning of the term "entry point" that I don't understand. If you're talking about the setuptools entry_points stuff, that just adds an extra dependency, runtime slowdown (setuptools entrypoints are sloooow) and complexity to what is conceptually a dirt-simple feature. Why would I want to do the whole setuptools song and dance routine for a simple executable script? But even if I did, [the right way to do it](https://chriswarrick.com/blog/2014/09/15/python-apps-the-right-way-entry_points-and-scripts/) is **still** to use `__main__.py`.
Thanks. I have to set some time aside to look into J Labs. I use Notebooks for a lot of my debugging and it's such a time saver.
Could you please show a full code example?
The most inner nested class.
airflow comes to mind
Can you show Python examples demonstrating both of those problems, please? Just so I fully understand.
Some nitpicks from me. * Stop whatever you are doing and read PEP8, then apply it. I find myself to be extremely liberal regarding line length in python (we got 1080p, 1440p or even higher resolution monitors, no need to stay shackled by almost 20 year old standards, sue me), but that is way too much for even me. * Another thing regarding PEP8 - undescriptive variable names. Like, what is "P" supposed to be, what is "f", what is "M". * I noticed you hate classes. No idea why. Good use of classes and maybe inner classes could help you completely eliminate those ugly prints from fighting part. * Globals - I know that they aren't as frowned upon in python as in other languages. But your file starting with 65 lines of globals (which if you still wanna use them, most of them should be tuples or dicts, not lists) is pretty extreme. Maybe try to move them all to json files and loading only the ones that are in use. * No idea if you were simply following original pokemon, but implementing more than one save slot isn't bad idea. TL;DR: [pylint](https://www.pylint.org/), [oop](https://realpython.com/python3-object-oriented-programming/), [named tuples](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#namedtuple-factory-function-for-tuples-with-named-fields) or [dataclasses](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html) and further into future [design patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern)
I would argue it doesn't hide it, because we already assume decorators to be applied to regular functions.
Perl does. You really don't want it.
Came to say. more-itertools is an early install in projects I work on.
1. /r/learnpython 2. The answer to your question depends on your assignment. If it was "write a program that implements the modified DFS algorithm", writing an implementation of the algorithm and not calling it would have been a pass from me, _but_: you're saying that the assignment was to "write a program [...] that [...]", so the program needs to actually _do something_, and you just implemented the algorithm but didn't show how to apply it to the problem.
/u/stebox covered the lack of utility. It's also already used in a string-ish context by path.py (which, despite certain features being emulated in stdlib, is still very popular). Most confusingly, why do division and floor division behave identically?
No other changes would be required to make it workable other than a single extra little bit of AST post-processing. All it would need to do is insert "self" into the first position of method argument signatures, and potentially functions with that decorator. You're right that maybe the syntax change for module functions is a bit too weird. A simple compromise is to just still require that functions defined outside of classes take a `self` argument. I think the proposal still has a lot of value in that case.
Every python friendly ETL tool.
A program should DO something, the output can be anything. If you write the code for an algorithm, but you cannot run it, then yes, it’s not a program. Usually a program would be: def main(argv): do something with args return something main(argv) So that you can then run it like $ myprogram args And expect an output
The slight cost of that would be outweighed by the much more proportionally-significant benefit of removing it from method signatures.
I still want switch statements. &amp;#x200B; example using if statements: screen = object.instance_variable if (screen == "MAINMENU"): # main menu things if (screen == "SOUNDMENU"): # sound menu things if (screen == "STATSMENU"): # stat menu things if (screen != "MAINMENU" and screen != "SOUNDMENU" and screen != "STATSMENU"): print("Menu not found/Error Message") vs switch statement screen = object.instance_variable switch (screen): case "MAINMENU": # main menu things break; case "SOUNDMENU": # sound menu things break; case "STATSMENU": # stat menu things break; default: print("Menu not found/Error Message")
There's a built-in module for doing configs in python called `configparser` https://docs.python.org/3/library/configparser.html no need for funny third party stuff. This might not be useful, but you say you're making a command line interface? Click is very nice for that: https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/7.x/why/
yeah, you would use whatever scheduling you want - cron works good but so does apscheduler if that's more your jam and depending on how ops-y or data-y you get this could also be jenkins or even airflow. It's pretty flexible in that regard.
I don't even believe OSM would be specifically helpful for this problem. Some of the ecosystem OSM interacts with certainly would, like Shapely/GEOS. That'd probably be the most full featured library I could recommend, if you want to keep it simpler that isn't really appropriate for a larger database or geography problems, pyeuclid and geometry-simple would be your best bets.
That's true. I think that's just a trade-off that would have to be made. I don't think that knowledge is really that important to beginners. Knowing what comes under the hood usually comes a bit later, and anyone willing to do that is likely to go and look it up anyway. A compromise could be to just still require methods defined outside of classes to have "self" as an argument, instead. I'd be fine with that, too.
In fact, the rewrite branch they're referring to is the one that's no longer maintained. It's now just the latest, stable version of discord.py and it's up to [version 1.2.2 on PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/discord.py/). There have been several breaking changes that happened between the rewrite branch and the current stable release, so using that older version is not recommended.
This sounds like a great idea! I have a friend who loves to DM so I think this would be a fun "gift" for him to play around with. Any starting points you'd recommend for DnD/RPG specific bots?
I'm in the US, but this seems like a really low salary to me for even a basic "experienced" developer position, let alone one that requires ML knowledge. Are the UK salaries that low?
Looks like this should work just fine from my experimenting with it just now, but the issue you are seeing here is in your `if page in test_list:` line, this is because your `page` variable is coming from looping over `doc` which is not returning a number to the `page` variable but rather a `Page()` object. So on this line if you do, `if page.number in test_list:` you should start to see that you will get inside your `if` statement where you modify the pdf. I had success using `doc.save()`, and didnt test `doc.saveIncr()`, so if that doesnt work keep that in mind.
What is your end goal here? What are you trying to actually _do_?
elif?
I feel like your example using if statements isn't really written... the best way... And if you used if-elif-else, you'd see that it's (a) shorter code, (b) at least equally understandable, and (c) easier to write. screen = object.instance_variable if screen == "MAINMENU": # main menu things elif screen == "SOUNDMENU": # sound menu things elif screen == "STATSMENU": # stat menu things else: print("Menu not found/Error Message") Also, I don't really understand what this has to do with string "division", but that's neither here nor there...
\&gt; python mypackage.egg Oh please no.
You don't have enough experience to realise how bad in general is to rely on direct invocation of a script. using python -m gives you a lot of guarantees on import, environment and overall sanity. I would actually advocate to remove the functionality of directly running a script altogether.
stunning
Naah, I doubt they would bother. And if they do just more Reddit fame to OP :)
Care to elaborate?
It really doesn't take much time to look into. Install it then run `jupyter lab` where you would usually run `jupyter notebook`. Now lab is running and you can spin up your notebooks from the web interface.
I am trying to see if I can actually run the emulator on my device, see how it looks/runs, what each of the functions defined in the scripts do, and then try to rewrite my own emulator/build on top of this. I'm trying to learn emulator development (and while there is already a subreddit for emulator dev), the folks over there did not help me out and redirected me here. Hoping on you guys now.
What is the prefered way? Just this? for i, item in mylist:
The emulator for what? Android?
So, I've used RPBot a few times and it's pretty decent, but I'm not a huge fan of the way it formats roll results. For music, I've used Ayana and a couple of others, but they're all very focused on queueing up music on request from the web. I get why, but I specifically wanted a bot who could take a manually-defined playlist of locally stored music and randomly shuffle until I tell it to stop. That's why I'm trying to make this "GM's Little Helper" bot. I might try next to figure it a way to store character info, possibly initiative, or maybe a "roll with advantage" function for 5E games. Not quite sure where I'm going to take it just yet. I think the real key for any RPG type bot is a good, solid die parser with clear results. My current code has a lot of very specific personality based on a long-running in-joke with one of my groups. Once I get all the functionality working, I'll make it more generic and upload to GitHub, in case it'll help somebody else.
Yes, the scripts here are for Android automotive.
So are you specifically looking for Android Auto, or are you trying to run the Android emulator in general?
I did have a program that used `pprint.pformat` in a logging debug inside a loop. It was fine when working with a small test data set, but ran longer with larger data sets. After doing some profiline I realized the pformat something like 80% of the run time, even when logging was set to info. I had it in a string `format`. Now I've seen this I wonder if the correct logging format would have prevented my problem.
Yes they can, if you use this instead of self in the inner class, both self and this are available, so the inner class can refer to either itself or the enclosing class.
Specifically looking for android auto, and specifically these scripts, can not be any other script. It's a long story why I need to stick with these, but I have to. Sorry for not making things more clearer!
You're going to have to, because those scripts aren't even used to run the Android Auto emulator.
Thanks for taking the time, I appreciate it! It does look powerful, I'll have to look into using it in my next project.
I understand that these scripts aren't used to specifically run the emulator, but instead act in more as test scripts, that generate driving info, control system for the car (windows, gas, engine info) etc. If i'm wrong, what are these scripts really for? I guess my question would be, can I run these scripts separately (not on top of anything) and get anything running? The [GUI.py](https://GUI.py) script for example, when I run it, what will appear, what will I see on my screen?
At a glance, those scripts are for debugging the emulator itself. The GUI.py script seems to provide some sort of a graphical interface to a specialized debug build of the firmware that can fake the state of the car.
That's right, now what I want to do is actually run the GUI script ( for example) and see the graphical interface on my device (or an emulator that I created on android studio). How would I go about doing that, that's the part i've been stuck on.
That method is fine, it's readable and simple. What more could you want.
I wrote a chunker that did basically what OP did. It made sense in the context of the specific program I was writing. But I've only used it again once, in a similar program.
That interface runs on your computer, not on the device at all. It also won't work with just any device - it needs the firmware on the device (or inside the emulator) to be running some sort of a debug HAL.
Thank you so much! I got the code to work, and now this barcode task is much simpler !!
You sound like you know what you're talking about, and honestly it's really helping. Could you please elaborate a little more on why the interface needs to run on my computer, and how? For example, vhal\_emulator.py script has a remotePortNumber on line 137, if I were to use it on my computer, what would I input there. Specifically, what needs to be running first on my computer to be able to run these scripts?
To be fair, I want switch/case as well, but only because I code in Perl at work and it's a nice convenience to have

That might be why it was in my head, I write a lot of Perl at my day job.
New to Python, but made a simple script to create an excel workbook with 53+ sheets and a pre-applied template. Currently working on building a script to apply multiple account numbers to all contracts in excel, but bashing my head against the keyboard trying to figure out how to write Account X to 10 contracts, etc.
I would probably use a list and the `in` operator. (Your if expression is missing two `or` anyway.) `if x in ['NP', 'SP', 'TP', 'JP', 'NYP', 'RP']:`
I usually go with in for that: if x in ("A", "B", "C"): print("damn")
OK, so. Android has a concept of HALs, which are basically like device drivers. These scripts are designed to be used with a special HAL that tells Android that it's a car, but is really just a bunch of code to relay commands over the network. You need to have a special Android image that includes that HAL, and then, when it runs, it will listen on a network port on the device's network. The scripts are then supposed to connect to the device through ADB, the general Android debug interface that all devices have, and access the same port that the debug HAL is listening on, and then they can send commands to it. The reason it doesn't work for you is because real devices (and production emulator images) don't actually include that debug HAL - it's a debugging tool only. Which brings me back to my original question: what the actual _heck_ are you trying to do?
Fantastic! If you need anymore help fell free to message me.
I look forward to reading it.
because 1. eggs are dead. 2. Running like that gives no guarantee that the environment it's running in has all the right and required dependencies 3. Running like that gives no guarantee that all the imports are resolved in the right way with the right entities 4. Running like that is pretty much limited to run python-only packages. If anything needs to carry stuff that needs to be dlopen()'d you are out of luck because you can't dlopen stuff that is packaged into a zip file. &amp;#x200B; If you are shipping an application, you are not only shipping an application, you are shipping an application \_and\_ its runtime environment. Running like that does not guarantee that, and generates a lot of strain and useless bug reports.
Oh and of course: tests =[ lambda x: x == "A", lambda x: x == "B", lambda x: x == "C"] if map(lambda f: f(x), tests).any(): print("that's the good shit")

Any way to make this compatible with linux/mac? This is exactly something I've been looking for but seems like the winreg module is required...
1 - that's why I said it also work with wheel packages. 2 - I always try to address the package versions available at the distribution I am targeting rather then relying on a virtual env. 3 - never had that problem. 4 - I do use ctypes to work with external libraries without a problem. Pkgresources handle that nicely, extracting what needs to be extracted. Maybe it's not fit for your needs, but it does fit mine.
I look forward to reading it!
You've pretty much saved a few days of my work. Without disclosing too much info, I am a current intern somewhere and have been given this task to run these scripts, and find a way to make them work. Going back to your answer, do you know a way I can download that specific android image on my phone that includes that HAL?
Not an answer to your question, but have you checked out TQDM?
Such an image is unlikely to exist, considering your phone is not, in fact, a car. You might be able to get an open source Android distribution like LineageOS (assuming it's been ported to your specific phone model), grab the source, reconfigure it to install car-related parts and the debug HAL, then build it from source and install it on your phone, but that's not a rabbit hole you want to go down. A rabbit hole you should want to go down is one that involves figuring out why you're doing the thing you're doing, and finding a working solution to the actual problem.
I want to emphasize this comment. I work in software no and one thing that hurt me is lack of a portfolio. I have so many old projects that wouldn't have been impressive to show if I still had them. Get on github, someday learn to use pep8, and put a link to your github on any business cards you make.
I'm not aware of that, what is it? Edit: Just googled it, and that's exactly what I was looking for! Thank you for your help!

[https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0427/#is-it-possible-to-import-python-code-directly-from-a-wheel-file](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0427/#is-it-possible-to-import-python-code-directly-from-a-wheel-file) &amp;#x200B; &gt;2 - I always try to address the package versions available at the distribution I am targeting rather then relying on a virtual env. &amp;#x200B; Generally a bad idea, only valid if your work for a linux distribution. &amp;#x200B; &gt;3 - never had that problem. &amp;#x200B; You always worked with small environment or situations where developers follow a strict, rigid discipline that is unattainable in practice in larger environments. &amp;#x200B; &gt;4 - I do use ctypes to work with external libraries without a problem. &amp;#x200B; You can't use dlopen on zipped so files. This applies also for LoadLibrary on windows. &amp;#x200B; [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45123852/dynamic-loaddlopen-shared-libraries-so-files-from-zip-file?rq=1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45123852/dynamic-loaddlopen-shared-libraries-so-files-from-zip-file?rq=1) &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &gt;Pkgresources handle that nicely, extracting what needs to be extracted. &amp;#x200B; This is true, but you assume that the code can be run to begin with, which again depends on what code and environment you are using. &amp;#x200B; &gt;Maybe it's not fit for your needs, but it does fit mine. &amp;#x200B; Yes, so exporting PYTHONPATH is for most people, but it's still a very bad idea.
I didn't test it in linux/mac yet. Try to do this - FlaskUI (app, browser_path=r"path/to/chrome.exe") or paste next to your main.py file the portable version of Chrome/Chromium, then FlaskUI(app).
PyQt5, Pandas, win32com (I am a windows user), and Google APIs.
Doesn't work directly since it still expects .exe and tries to import the winreg module etc. But with the help of your hint, I actually got it working..If you want me to, I could maybe try to add support for Mac (Linux) and make a pull request to your repo... Or at least show you my findings because I am not sure whether I have the skills to completely add support for mac/linux..
To repeat what Jon Snow has said several times, "I don't want it."
I call it, 'the edge of the universe.' *audience claps* Thank you, thank you.
It’s an okay feature, but not all that useful imo.
The version I have lying around (think I found it online somewhere years ago) of basically the same idea for handling uneven line chunks: def alternating_size_chunks(iterable, steps): """Break apart a line into chunks of provided sizes Args: iterable: Line of text to process. steps: Tuple of int sizes to divide text, will cycle. Returns: Return a generator that yields string chunks of the original line. """ n = 0 step = itercycle(steps) while n &lt; len(iterable): next_step = next(step) yield iterable[n : n + next_step] n += next_step
This is awesome. Great job!

Just a comment that you should use a context manager when writing to a file, not the. Close() method
&amp;#x200B; &gt;&gt;&gt; ( "asdfasdf"/ 2 ) * 2
This would make a great interview question &lt;/sarcasm&gt;
I am sorry would you explain this ?
This week I've been reading [A Philosophy of Software Design](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07N1XLQ7D/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_d_asin_title_o00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1). It's been a nice book so far!
There's an app called Android Auto, it has developer options that can be enabled to do some testing. [https://developer.android.com/training/cars/testing](https://developer.android.com/training/cars/testing) &amp;#x200B; There's also a thing called Desktop Head Unit, it's on the same link I've mentioned above. Another thing is the automotive emulator on Android Studio. Will these things not work either?
Those aren't for the same thing at all. They are for testing apps that run on Android Auto compatible head units, which is _not_ the same thing as Android running directly _on_ the head unit. What is your end goal here? Do you _know_ what your end goal is?
Basically, my goal is to understand what these scripts do. That includes: \- Find out what they do \-Find out how they work \-Find out how to run them \- Run them Secondly, if I can't run them, then test some of the functions in the script by hard coding some of the data. Do you know if that's possible?
No, that's not your end goal. _Why_ are you trying to understand what those scripts do?
That's a good question, I guess my team needs to use these scripts for a project that they are working on, and my task is to understand what these scripts do and then explain it to them. I'm an intern, so I pretty much have to carry out tasks that i'm assigned on. &amp;#x200B; Could you tell me if i can even test the functions in the script by hard coding some of the data?
What functions? That script is basically just an extremely dumb GUI for the network protocol used by the debug HAL. What does your team actually _need to do_? "I'm an intern, I do what I'm told" is not a good excuse. Go figure out what your team actually _needs_, and do that thing, not the thing someone told you to do.
The big risk with this feature is that because prob doesn't use strict type checks, and using a type checker is optional and not likely with beginners, this can easily carrier word bugs for beginners that accidentally pass a numeric string as an argument instead of a proper number, which will cause really weird errors
Selenium is a bit like a wrench. You will understand it much better by using than by reading about it. Go to google.com and start trying to automate searching and finding things. It's fairly straight forward and simple to use. It is only somewhat tricky to use when you start dealing with multiple windows, multiple tabs, and iframes.
I wan't to learn more about the find element by ID, name, tag, XPATH and all of the other because I'm creating a script but the CSS selector changes every time the website is opened
That is a common tactic to prevent people from using browser automation tools on the page. Is it facebook? Facebook is real aggressive with those techniques. Here are CSS selector cheat sheets [1](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.asp) [2](https://adam-marsden.co.uk/css-cheat-sheet) Here are XPATH cheat sheets [1](https://devhints.io/xpath) [2](https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xpath_syntax.asp)
Where are you working that you use Perl? It's pretty rare these days outside of sysadmin work. I used to work on a huge web app in Perl.
I am not exactly in the position right now to be able to pay for any courses, so anything free x.x? Oh and how much can the documentation help me? I have been going through for a while.
Really good read, appreciate how detailed the explanation is. Tutorials like this often skip over details as it's assumed you already know x, y, z.

A couple legacy CGI apps we're working on replacing, and most of the backend scripts are Perl as well. I've developed an appreciation for the things it does well, we'll say that much.
The range(n) iterator comes up in a lot of leet code questions where the first input is the number of test cases you get with n = int(input()), I have been doing a bunch of them recently. But how would you produce an iterator of length n?
Oh don't get me wrong, I love Perl. Just always interested to see who actively uses it these days.
A neat tool for scraping all the UK council website dwelling applications. I will be storing them into a single database table. &amp;#x200B; The tool itself will have 3 text files as the python file will be compiled. XPaths.txt URLs.txt SQL.txt &amp;#x200B; XPaths will have in order the xpaths it needs to find along with an attribute for either clicking a button or scraping text. In the text file it'll know which authority it is with it being contained like this &amp;#x200B; `Gosport [` `xpath - text` `xpath - click` `]` &amp;#x200B; stuff like that &amp;#x200B; URLs will be formatted like this: &amp;#x200B; `Authority - URL to planning application` `Authority2 - Other Link` `Authority3 - Other Other Link` &amp;#x200B; It's set like this so with an argument you can select the authority and it'll instantly know which website to scrape from &amp;#x200B; SQL.txt is made because almost all councils have different data available to scrape. I need to make it so each council has a specific SQL command for specific data going to my database. The format is &amp;#x200B; `Authority Name - INSERT INTO tblCouncils (columns go here) VALUES (Values go here)` etc... &amp;#x200B; The python file itself has a bunch of functions reading through these files automatically knowing which is which based off of an argument
prefered way: for item in mylist: there is few case where index should be necessary
Not a fan of Perl's type coercion. When your language's version of int() is "just add 0 to your string and it'll turn it into an integer" it's a bit concerning.
I tried to witr an example on my phone but it keeps autocorrecting code. Just Google 'python file open context manager' .
Is this specifically made for the Tinder app or does the voice command simply move the cursor to a hard coded X-Y position and clicks?
I have a question about this, so looking at it seems grouper splits into fixed size chunks right? A while back I wrote a function to split a list into n sub-lists of equal size (or as close as possible if the length isn't divisible by n) because I couldn't find anything at the time to do that. Know of anything that would work for that case?
Looks to me like they are looking for someone 1-2 years out of collage.
The README should match the version of the code published on PyPI.
Words to live by: if you can think of it, probably someone else has too. Annoying when coming up with business ideas, fantastic when it comes to open source software.
Stupid question time! In that example, why do your results for `a / 4` and `a / 5` produce the same results, and the same for `a // 3` and `a // 4`?
There's autopep8 and, for the truly brave, Black. (I joke. Kind of.) But they will only fix formatting mistakes of course, not conceptual ones like defining a variable and then never using it.
Very detailed tutorial with good explainations. Thank you op.
They are hard coded positions using pynput. I could use selenium to press the Button elements though.
All right, got it. But perhaps its a new standard I think because I remember that earlier when I'd published a package without twine (either setup.py or uploading manually to the site, I don't remember) at that time, I hadn't mentioned the README attribute and it took automatically from the github repo! Also, other package managers like NPM don't accept a README at all, they simply reflect what's on the github page, isn't it?

Yes, that's what NPM does, and it's generally kind of problematic.
Chocolatey
Chocolatey can install the Windows Store version? I don't want the standard MSI installer.
r/learnpython will help you more. Also, this is advanced for a beginner project, especially if you want to use a GUI. Text only versions would be more doable, but still hard for beginners.
Control-F `pokemon[gamedata["Pc"][gamedata["party"][currentPokemon]]]` `56 matches found` Frankly, this is amazing that you've gotten so far without refactoring. Few developers could manage that.
A context manager manages setup and tear-down logic, meaning it's safer (what if you forgot to close a file/database connection for example?). with open(some_file, "r") as f: // File gets opened f.read() // File get implicitly closed
Is there a more advanced tutorial on scraping which goes into the difficulties of avoiding getting banned, performance, tools...
Agreed, this would really benefit from some classes and some shortened lines. &amp;#x200B; OP, for example: from enum import Enum class PkmnTypes(Enum): NORMAL = 1 FIRE = 2 WATER = 3 GRASS = 4 ... class Pokemon(): def __init__(self, name, types): self.name = name self.types = types self.weakness = self.get_weakness() self.ineffective = self.get_ineffective() self.immune = self.get_immune() def get_weakness(self): weaknesses = [] if PkmnTypes.FIRE in self.types: weaknesses.append(PkmnTypes.WATER) weaknesses.append(PkmnTypes.ROCK) weaknesses.append(PkmnTypes.ROCK) weaknesses.append(PkmnTypes.GROUND) if PkmnTypes.WATER in self.types: weaknesses.append(PkmnTypes.GRASS) weaknesses.append(PkmnTypes.ELECTRIC) return weaknesses def get_resistance(self): ineffective [] ... def get_immune(self): immune = [] ... def get_attack_multiplier(attack_type, pokemon): if attack_type in pokemon.immune: return 0 else: # It's possible to have a double-weakness or double-resistance multiplier = 1.0 multiplier *= .5**pokemon.ineffective.count(attack_type) multiplier *= 2**pokemon.weakness.count(attack_type) return multiplier While the set-up for defining the weaknesses may not be effectively shorter than your long string comparisons in your code, having it be a property (and in this case, an enumeration) of a Pokemon class makes it much easier to \_read\_ and later to extend a weakness chart (in case you add Gen 2's Dark and Steel, for instance).
Something I want to try, this explains it clearly without expecting prior knowledge. Will definitely use this when I have a go at the weekend.
Any code you put in the 'case' part of a switch statement can be wrapped up in a function and that function placed in a dictionary. I came from a C++ background and at first the lack of switch statements was weird, but that's just because I wasn't thinking about the pythonic way to do things: screen = object.instance_variable screen_to_menu = { "MAINMENU": exec_main_menu, "SOUNDMENU": exec_sound_menu, "STATSMENU": exec_stats_menu } exec_menu = screen_to_menu.get(screen) if exec_menu: exec_menu() else: print("Menu not found/Error Message")
Eh, they generally go after the really big ones, like Pokemon Generations, Pokemon Evoas, and some of the bigger RPGMaker projects. Most people don't know how to use the command-line, so it ain't going to get big enough to really threaten anything they do.
thank you!

If you are using (and requiring) setuptools 30.3.0 or newer, you can set the long\_description in a [setup.cfg file](https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setuptools.html#configuring-setup-using-setup-cfg-files). &amp;#x200B; Probably not a good idea to have your package depend on github. &amp;#x200B; If you need to make some changes the README and want to release it to PyPI, make a very minor release. Note that README was updated in your Changelog notes. It is okay to leave your repo to be a little ahead of PyPI. It is kinda up to you as the maintainer.
It would be cooler if it could track your eye movements, figure out if you dig, and swipe accordingly.

I've been using Python for a while and I didn't even know about the `turtle` library. Very interesting, keep it up! :D
Well, that's useful for using tinder while your hands are busy (if you know what I mean)
Bookmarked for later.
what is the difference between the msi and the store version? just curious
There are many ways. If you don't want to use setuptools and you have a multi file project, I think this __main__.py is good.
Microsoft manages and automatically updates applications from the store. Don't need to worry about grabbing malicious packages

Is it possible to pin this post?
How does this work? Are you simulating the app on your phone and then interacting with it on some other program that controls swiping?
I came up with the Idea while stuck in traffic, hands free Tinder all day!
Python is such a beautiful language &lt;3
I was going to leave a comment along the lines of "Perl can probably do this" but it was supposed to be a joke...
I am using Pynput to simulate mouse clicks on the Tinder webapp in Chrome. The end goal is to make something that can run on a phone but I don't really know how to.
Oh yeah I didn’t know tinder had a webapp. I was trying to wrap my head around how an iOS app was being controlled by python haha. Still cool man, good job

How about 'asdfasdf'/ 'asdf' == 2?
If you are interested in lisp and python you might like Hy http://docs.hylang.org/en/stable/quickstart.html . An important difference I'd like to point out is that the most important data structure in lisp is the list (cons cells/pairs) and in pthyon the dict (name-space, object). This is what I think lisp got wrong, the dict is the more powerful data structure (Clojure fixes this though).
i wonder if we can triangulate your location with this info
`'asdfasdf'.count('asdf')`

You’ve apparently never heard of a penile plethysmograph
Even cooler if it could analyze face expression to figure out how much the user like the person in the picture, and swipe based on that. Even^(2) cooler if it could analyze ... you know.
That's awesome! I *love* it when scripting makes a task 1000x more efficient, and especially when praise is involved. Sometimes I feel like I need to find a job that is geared more towards stuff like that, but I'm pretty happy with my engineering gig. A while back at my job, I made a GUI application (compiled to a Windows executable) that transforms a fairly complicated SQL database into a more manageable dictionary object and exports everything into excel in a way that is user-readable. It became a pretty widely used tool by probably a dozen or so people throughout my company and has even offset tasks I'd have to do myself onto other people...which is basically what I live for. When I say "If I could automate myself out of a job I would", I mean it literally.
Awesome job! Python makes miserable jobs fun and you were able to showcase off your talent, which could lead to other opportunities. Keep it up!
This is cool but it would be cooler if it used sentiment analysis too, you could say more natural things in response to the profiles
FYI there's a tinder API ([https://github.com/fbessez/Tinder](https://github.com/fbessez/Tinder)) which should make your job a bit easier.
What a fucking idiot amirite? I mean, I totally know what a penile plethysmograph is but why don’t you explain for the rest of these idiots
Thanks. Looks very useful for a beginner as myself :)
IIRC it's a device that measures change in girth of a penis. It's often used to measure arousal.
Wouldn't it be more natural to say "yes" or "no"?
Thanks! I just wanted to make something quick and dirty but I'll definitely try to use the API. The speech recognition is extremely slow unfortunately.
The speech recognition library is a little wonky and this was the most consistent way to get results.

Excellent! Check out python sets. It's easier to do a compare than lists.

Same concept, complicating code, whereas a switch self contains.
I would never tell my manager how easy Python makes things; but he's a douchebag.
What's your metric for "complicating code"? You're trying to jam three functions into one. The switch statement balloons in the number of lines of code as you add more code for each individual menu, but the snippet involving the dictionary I made will stay the same size because the lines of code added are confined to their own functions.
Is there a GitHub repository you are sharing this to or keeping is strictly personal? Interesting concept.. guess you could do the SQL writing to just a Excel file if need be? ( Of course not using a SQL statement. I get the concept of reading from the txt file(still newer to python) but would like to see the formatting more to understand better... I think storing the xpaths in a txt file is a great idea and would help truncate an automation script I am currently using at work.. a bunch of xpath click statements in my codebase looks clunky.
Good job. It's amazing how many people that work with this stuff don't know simple things like that.
I want switches implemented because I like them, you're allowed to like other shit, I don't fucking care. &amp;#x200B; I mean, truthfully, does it fucking matter what I think? You don't care, you are going to argue your point anyway. Good, you do what you want to do, I still want switches.
Alright then I'll use it when I get my PC for now ill learn to code on mobile thanks
Neat but I almost always need to split on a delim or something equally as boring
Good job. Check out VLOOKUP in Excel for another way to do it. I was expecting you to say you figured how to collect the asset info from the 327 servers using Python. Now that would be something.

Could have been done in 3 minutes with the existing Excel function library. I'm all for automation, but this is the kind of humblebrag people used to do 10 years ago but substitute python for VBA.
You posted that you wanted switch statements. We're not the ones to go to when you're begging for changes to python, so the logical response anyone could provide would be to show you how to code more effectively without switch statements. Don't get so indignant just because you didn't get the empathy you're subconsciously begging for. Seriously, being this aggressive about telling people "I don't care" just makes you look like an edgelord.
If you're making a voice activated Python script that swipes right on Tinder girls, you had no shot either way.
Same thing I thought. No way you should be using Find in Excel to compare two lists. I agree you could have probably used Python to collect the asset info of the servers instead of doing it manually.
My golden rule on professional task automation: If the goal was achieved in less or equal company time as what was allotted by project management, then it was worth it.
good thing you said this 3 times in 3 slightly different ways
absolutely not
Great first step to working smart! Kudos. What these auntie and uncles are saying is keep on working smarter and smarter :)
Cool beans. Exactly why I don't care to discuss it, I've literally stated you can do whatever you want, and you're acting as you are.
it pays to know programming tools
Good point.
Similar story. One of our customers had gone 30+ days without a certain file getting processed. I had to collect the unprocessed files, un-archive the files, process them and clean up, etc.... So I thought about it and figured this would take me a good 6 hours to accomplish. Well capital F that. I wrote a python script in about 1 hour. Tested it and figured out a few things I did wrong, corrected it and executed. Walked away and when all said and done didn't have to babysit 30+ files for processing. Took care of regular business and went to lunch. Love it when Python saves the day.
15 divided by 2, rounded is 8 divided by 2 is 4 divided by two with no remainder is 2 and the remainder of 2 divided by 2 is 0. That's how I read it.

This is a project I do every week in Fareham for volunteer work. My boss and I have discussed releasing onto Github the code once finished. For now there is no repository but there is a good chance there will be one in the near future. I could write you up an example file of something that accomplishes different tasks but using the same methods through a text file if you would like?

Awesome job!!! Between python, vim or emacs, and unix pipelines (grep/sed/awk) you can really wow some people. Keep it up! You'll be unpleasantly surprised!
Or in your case, the subatomic distance between protons.
did you use the set functions?
I can say I did something similar.... I am a intern at a research lab. And we had 16 csv files for which I had to run a script on all of them. But I found a way to edit the code a bit an run a single script that does the job for all of the files on a single run.... Good job tho.....
Yeah. // is floor division. * Start with 15 * 15 floor divided by 2 = 7 * 7 divided by 2 = 3.5 * 3.5 floor divided by 2 = 1 * 1 modulus 2 = 1
There has to be a way of collecting data that way right?
Excel is also your friend, you can do that with countif, vlookup, or duplicate coloring. Under 10 minutes. But hey, you got paid doing python. That's important.
Aye. I remember when after a family wedding we had to choose pics which would go into the album out of literally hundreds of photos. I was given the task of compiling them. I ended up making a script from which the elders could select the pics they wanted and get compiled in a separate folder to be mailed to the photographer. They were happy their spending on my education wasn't a total waste 😅
Good question! When \`a / 4\` is called, behind the scenes it calls \_\_truediv\_\_, which uses wrap to determine the length of each segment based on the total length of the string. The function is \`round(8/4)\`, which of course doesn't need to be rounded in the case of 4 because 8/4 is 2. Therefore each segment is two characters, resulting in four equal groups. For \`a / 5\` however, the function is \`round(8/5)\`, 8/5 producing 1.6, which is rounded up to 2, thereby producing the same result as \`a/4. &amp;#x200B; For \`a // 3\` it's a similar issue but in reverse, as we're dealing with flooring instead of rounding. In that case, the function is \`floor(8/3)\`, 8/3 being 2.66.., which in the case of \`a / 3\` is rounded up to three but for \`a // 3\` is dropped to 2, thereby resulting in the same output as \`a / 4\`.
I am mistaken then. Thanks
Interesting idea, although \`"hello world".split(" ")\` (or just split() ) and \`" ".join(\["hello", "world"\])\` aren't too verbose or complicated and \`\* " "\` is terrifying

Your calls to `super()` by itself aren't doing anything.
Thanks for inspiring my next exercise for my students haha this seems like a great real world scenario example of using python not as a programmer but for other professionals.
Sure, I would suggest reading the first part and then trying the second part on your own. This way it help will you gain more intuition, and you will learn by doing.

Without any actual tool you could just sort both lists alphabetically side by side and compare when they differ :D
1. You should check your sheet. Obviously. 2. Simple spreadsheet good. 310 lines for a task is simple. 3. Excel isn't on iPad article from 2012? Seriously? Is python any better? I am a proud friend of both python(pandas) and excel. Come join us.

What is the Excel way to do this?
Start with pyodbc, work your way down from there.
Nice job! You could have also pasted one list a few cells under the other in the same column. Then select the column, hit conditional formatting, then the top option (forget what it’s called), then highlight duplicates. Whatever is not highlight is missing.
Drop the full list in excel and do a Conditional format for duplicates. Within 30 seconds you’d know what was missing.
Came here to suggest this. Or, if you're really lazy, alphabetically sort both lists and then open then vimdiff a.txt b.txt to see the differences color coded. ETA ~1 minute.
There is a few but the most obvious is vlookp or index/match
Great job! Also, the "crap jobs" don't necessarily end when you're not an intern lol. I'm working for a similarly sized company and I was tasked with getting warranty data for 20,000 + devices. Luckily they're mostly the same few brands and APIs are available. Still working through data quality issues though. All done in Python too!
Put the two lists side by side in Excel, then use any of the like 15 formulas Excel has such as COUNTIF or MATCH or SUMIF. For example, if the list of 327 known assets is in cells A1:A327 while the manual list is in B1:B318, then in cell C1 enter “=SUMIF(A1,B1:B318)” and then copy the formula down to row 327. All the assets with a zero next to them will be the missing assets.
Very cool, thanks!
I think this is a little disingenuous. asyncio, by design, is NOT concurrent. It’s “concurrent.” With threading, you never know when the code is going to be interrupted. But it’ll carry out two tasks simultaneously by doing some work, switching contexts, doing other work, etc. asyncio only switches contexts at known places, which is why I’ve grown to enjoy it. When it encounters an await, it’ll change contexts for other work. Much easier to maintain a shared state. So that’s why I consider it “concurrent” instead of concurrent. It always finishes the current task, or at least reaches a known point where you’ve given permission to switch contexts, before doing something else.
How can someone learn? /r/learnpython can do that for you. How can you learn? We can't answer that for you. Maybe /r/iwanttolearn can.
Oh like how dividing by 0 results in 0? That totally makes sense... Once you don't have `use strict`, you'll find you can never add it.
Thank a lot

It works for all, but it finds chrome automatically only in windows for now. I will add a more readable error. A quick fix is this: `FlaskUI (app, browser_path=r"path/to/chrome.exe")` My recommended way of using flaskwebgui is this: - Download portable [Chromium](https://chromium.woolyss.com/) for the targeted os - place the extracted portable app next to "main.py" file, - rename the folder (that contains chrome.exe) "chrome" and when started it will look for "chrome/chrome.exe" or ""chrome/bin/chrome.exe" In this way when you distribute it you don't need to other users to have chrome installed, it will work like a portable app. Also, during development of your app do that in the normal way you do a Flask app without flaskwebgui. Use flaskwebgui only when you are finished the app and ready to deploy. flaskwebgui doesn't interfere with your way of doing a flask application it just helps converting it into a desktop app more easily with pyinstaller or [pyvan](https://github.com/ClimenteA/pyvan)
You are illiterate, aren't you?
Get a project. Nothing big. Nothing important. Something interesting. Like web scraping or image manipulation. With a project then you have a purpose. Use it to learn what you need to finish the project. Then choose another or add on to the one you have. Could even be something like making a shopping list or Alexa job.
Could have done it in 20 seconds by using diffnow.com
Most would say vlookup, but you could also just copy one list under the other one and remove the duplicates. There are another dozen ways to do this, that's why excel is so great.
There's also a remove duplicates option if you put them both in the same sheet. Leave you with the ones that don't have a match
Lol
What about some kind of KD-tree? A rectangle can be represented as a 4D (K = 4) point (assuming they are all axis aligned).
Yeah, with hindsight a lot of tools have the same principle: sequence tasks with a Yaml description (ansible, Gitlab-CI, Travis, docker-compose, etc. I don't know of Kubernetes but it may be the same). The major difference between those tools is the nature of entities that are manipulated. In the case of Yapyseq, those entities are Python functions. But it is just my opinion.

If both lists are in excel you open both workbooks and use this formula =Match(lookup_value, lookup_array, match_type)
Cool idea, I had to do something similar in the past. But it would be better as a new method with a proper name and some optional parameters do handle the last uneven chunk. Or a function inside the string module.
Yea, I sometimes wish I just had some other kind of job and then have these moments all the time lol
Sounds like you wrote a script to do a vlookup?
I know it’s not python but a unix utility, but you could have done “diff &lt;file name 1&gt; &lt;filename 2&gt;” without the &lt;&gt; and it would have told you what are the differences between them.
Lego has programmable robots that are interfaceable with labview among other things - wouldn't be surprised if you could also use python
I must admit I did not explore the `async` features of Python yet. I’ll try to do it soon !
I'm thinking a pi might be able to handle this. Using a strong motor that can turn the wheels you can probably send it to the road by programming it or even doing it remotely.
With confidential information it is generally a bad idea to use online tools like this. You have no idea where that information is going or if it is being stored somewhere.
No need to even go that complex, can just run MATCH and you'll get the same response

This reminds me a lot of r/fitness the common questions and general what ide to use questions are super similar. But also it seems the communities have a big difference in attitudes towards newbies. I find that in r/fitness people are happy to encourage others to improve and what not while here they’re almost scolding each other for asking dumb questions. New people can’t help but ask dumb questions because that’s how they learn. One thing r/fitness has is a very in depth wiki that I think handles most basic questions and the way people get referred to it is nice too not always some “did you try google!” Just an observation.

YCombinator alumni, nuff said
that does seem to be the consensus. if I knew what a vlookup is I could more directly answer you.
Yeah, that's an important point. Doing 319 out of 327 isn't still an A: it's go back and finish it. It's important to get into the habit of checking your work before you send it out.
I mean xlsxwriter reads excel files too... so... what's the difference?
One thing I noticed is that you put the last minimum object to mini variable in line 6, while you put first index of that minimum object in line7. This makes the process incorrect when there is duplicate in the list. If it's still not working, post with sample input and output.

yeah... remember this is amazon. You know, one of the largest data processing companies in the world. Including government, financial, and private data.

1. /r/learnpython 2. Be more specific about the exact error you're getting.
&gt; but you could also just copy one list under the other one and remove the duplicates. You actually couldn't -- that would give you a list of 327 asset tags and a dialog box telling you that 319 duplicates were removed
Are you using any `context_processor` that does it? Did you inspect the value in the template to figure out the source of it? Could you share your settings.py and requirements list?

Oh dang, you're right, haven't thought this through. Show duplicates would be the better idea.
I was awaiting a future in which someone would all explain this, so I wouldn't have to concurrently generate such a comment. I'm glad I yielded.
I’m a beginner building a voluntary work project in R and python as needed (I’m more versed in R at this point). It’s a complicated project that I’m excited about and proud of. I doubt we will use it when I present it though because there’s a clique in management where they want to make someone completely inexperienced the head data person even over our data person who is no joke one of the smartest people I’ve ever met. They would rather favor someone and accept an inefficient product using google forms than an efficient one made with Python or R. But even if they don’t want to implement it, I can sure as hell use it and put in on my resume. For me it has been amazing for me to learn. Spent a long time wanting to learn but not being able to slog through books and online modules. I learn by doing so I’ve picked up way more this way and actually get reassured when I see my code work and change.
phrasing.
No, it's not really the same. I had a similar situation once: three million rows and quite a few columns was the size of my dataset. Excel couldn't handle that, nor vba, but python could, and the best part is that I can always retrace my steps and undo things unlike vba
If OP doing data entry on 3 million rows in Excel they have bigger problems. With that kind of set a database is close to mandatory and there are equivalent comparison tools in SSMS or SSRS as well.
not to knock on your enthusiasm, but you can do the same thing in Excel in 2 mins too and you avoid having to learn about parsing xls.
So not even google respects pep8?
Can sets have duplicates? If so could throw out assets if they're listed the same (unlikely, but could be possible).
Doesn't matter for this exercise. You're looking for assets that only appear in one set and not the other.
when I was your age, I’d have simply done the compare in excel. Probably done in under 10 mins
the hardest part would be getting the data out of excel... probably need to go use the menus and export it to csv
&gt; Excel couldn't handle that, nor vba, but python could, Yeah, I know we're in /r/python but /u/the_monkey_knows spelled "SQL" funny there.

Many years ago, I was once a two-week temp (there were 13 of us) and we were reconciling some spreadsheets. I did a `VLOOKUP` on the first day and did far, far, far more than everyone else. When they asked how, I said that I basically got it to highlight all the matches, so I can focus only on the things that didn't have a direct match. The next day, one three temps came (they asked the other ten not to come back) and they told everyone about my new technique. I was horrified that I had automated away ten jobs, but luckily they were only temp jobs. I've since learned Python and some other programming languages and have a job where I spend much of the day programming. But I've been very careful ever since then. I don't want to ever automate someone's job away ever again. I want to help people do their jobs more efficiently.
Who said they don't? (some do, some don't - why would you create a virtualenv for a simple script with no associated modules?) My point is an entirely different one: I want to install modules system-wide. Now, I could do that and put all the stuff in /usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages but "dist-packages" does not sound right to me at all. I would expect something like "site-packages" like it's mentioned in several docs and the same in other languages (ie perl). Yet python on recent Debian or Ubuntu versions is obviously built without those directories in os.path. So, my issue is only half a question and have a complaint :)
&gt; I want to install modules system-wide. You shouldn't want to do that. If you _really_ want to do that, you should use [dh-python](https://debian-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dh_python.html).
Automation brings a different sensation, it's absolutely not like seeing something do your job. It's like being able to do more and better, as if you're the one doing the whole work through extensions of yourself! And the satisfaction that it brings is a little extra! Glad more people feel like me about automation.
&gt; Aren't the vast majority of AWS VMs and containers Linux based? Couldn't tell you. we're not working with VMS. At least not directly anyway. We're all hard ware based. We get a ticket, we reboot something, or replace something. &gt;All development activity where I work is done on AWS Workplace vdi (Windows and Linux but far more of the latter). my internship isn't with anything development based. It's all parts and tickets. We get a ticket, we power cycle something, reboot something, replace a cable/harddrive/dim/mobo/PSU and we close the ticket. All the computers we use are windows 10 HPs.
There's an API call that allows you to reorder playlist items. You need a PlaylistItemID (which identifies a video within a playlist) and a position (just make sure you order the playlist from first-to-last, since the position is not absolute). You also need admin/owner access to the account. &amp;#x200B; Update queries are expensive though. Each one "costs" 53 query points and the default quota for GCP accounts is 10,000/day (so you're limited to around 180 videos, unless you get a quota increase). &amp;#x200B; You can check out the code on [github](https://github.com/cgranier/pytube). &amp;#x200B; I run a digital media agency and we manage a YouTube MCN. I mostly use Python to create scripts that make managing all the data easier. (In this case, it's a real pain to reorder a playlist with 200+ episodes using YouTube's drag-and-drop browser interface). &amp;#x200B; Other fun projects I'm working on is a video metadata translator where you could grab a video's metadata, run it through a Google Translate API, and update your video's metadata in a bunch of different languages. Apparently good for SEO ;-)
So, if you don't mind me asking: Your mo would be to put each and every script in it's own venv and then install my own, shared modules by copying them individually to every venv? If this is best pratice - can you point me to where I can read about it? Thanks for your input!
I once programmed on a linux, and it said I had to download the Time Module even though I had the right version of python so I just put that there just in case.
Are your scripts actually separate projects, or are they part of the same codebase? If they're part of the same codebase, you should put the entire codebase into a single virtual environment. If they're different, you should give them each its own virtual environment.
 &gt;&gt;&gt; a = "try google" &gt;&gt;&gt; print("what should you do? ", a) what should you do? try google
Weird. I've seen certain standard library modules missing like SQLite (this was a result of compiling Python from source) but never the time module. Either way, makes sense :\^) Either way, my advice is that the usual "Module Not Found" error will be sufficient enough so that you don't have to add your own try/excepts, at least for builtins. Just include a requirements.txt with your projects (\`pip freeze &gt; requirements.txt\`) if you have anything extra.
SQL is not available to everyone nor is it convenient all the time. In my particular case, I needed to do a lot of calculations with the dataset, which would have been a horrible piece of nested code in SQL. Also, even tough that Azure Data Studio now allows you to create SQL notebooks, jupyter notebooks with python allow you to add clear explanations without spending hours trying to decipher what the original creator of a long SQL is doing. As simple as the task that OP accomplished, it’s a great skill for him to have when SQL, excel, or vba don’t cut it. That’s why I upvoted his post, he’s an intern, he’s expanding his toolbox, don’t be so strict with him.
Set members are all unique. No duplicates.
Except if your original assets had two of the same and your missed one of them.
Copying from Excel columns to vim never gave me any issues.
Hey that’s awesome, congrats!
I didn't start out with the total list so I didn't know we didn't have information for 8 units until I had gone to the boss. I had a pile of items to get info off of, I went through the pile and got the info. Then I found how there were other units not in that pile that are supposed to be in this list.
Look into set theory. It probably will simplify and improve a ton of code you've written in the past.
Yeah, you’re right, I do use SQL to upload or join big tables from work. The thing is that we use excel primarily for calculations, lots and lots of formulas, operations, and functions. Which is why I gave that example, it was a job for excel, but given its size, python allowed me to write clean code with explanations that not only got the job done, but made it easy for any other worker to understand clearly what I had done. That said, I always tend to think of SQL first, but there are few instances when having python skills under your belt do make a difference.
Hackermann
Yikes, imagine being a sad shit bag that tries to belittle an intern's accomplishments.
Look into Visual Basic for Applications, VBA. It’s scripting you can do directly in apps like access or excel. Way quicker than python and arguably more impressive and easier to distribute and reuse, depending on the task. Also, brush up on excel features and functions. You can save yourself literally days worth of time with a handful of functions that can do the same work in just a few minutes.

Code seems to run fine except when you have duplicates in the list. I tried with n &lt; 10 and n &gt; 10, also tried with numbers between 1 and 20, all numbers &lt; 10 , all numbers &gt; 10.
that wasn't my intention. I was just curious.
I get it, I used to get text files output by an archaic AS400 and ran C# scripts to compare against the 'new' system database. I'm remembering headaches involving AS400 dropping leading 0s to save precious bytes of storage data....in social security numbers -.- The tool to fit the job though, right?
C will become as legendary a skill as COBOL by 2025.
I didn't mean that you didn't do great. It was just an FYI since the problem is common enough that on linux you have a dedicated system tool exactly for that.
right I get that... but I don't work with Linux systems. So... yeah, it's great that linux has a tool to do it. It doesn't help me any.
But maybe it will help other people reading this thread. You created it but you are not the only one reading comments.
fair.
hey @xr09 can you give us a link on it? i'm not that familiar with iirc. Thanks in advance!
It will remain standard in its domain. Most of the Python growth is at the expense of other high level languages.
Good god I hope they expand Python support into tools like Virtuoso. SKILL is such a bitch to work with.
&gt; Can sets have duplicates? No, but I would guess that the assets have some sort of unique ID (asset tag or similar), even if everything else about them is the same.
You could have a dictionary with the set values as keys and the number of occurances as values. This way you should be able to do the arithmetic you want.
Could you not have a scenario where there are 2 assets that are identical but the second list only has 1 of those? When converting them to sets, that asset would show in both sets.
So much for Python 3000

Pretty shitty example because the examples are not doing the same thing, setting some level of namespacing and the command line args. You could use a C++ jit or jshell to execute single expressions.
There's surprisingly little difference between thread-based concurrency and asyncio. While a thread may eventually be interrupted " spontaneously" by the kernel, the python VM will not change contexts for at least 100 bytecodes (by default) and if you turn this value up ( using sys.setcheckinterval() ), in fact the VM will only switch contexts when you hit a blocking IO call (sleep, read, write etc.) ... just like with asyncio. Summary: get the benefits of asyncio the easy way: just set sys.setcheckinterval() really high! No more faffing with new syntax, co-routines and other nonsense. Python2.1 rules!
I always impress when i whip out my python ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
iRobot (Roomba) has/had "devkits" (the Create series) for which there's a Python library https://pypi.org/project/pycreate2/ They also have "connected" vacuums whose API is accessible (I guess was reverse-engineered?): https://github.com/NickWaterton/Roomba980-Python
if you take it out around children, the cops needs to get involved.
&gt; jupyter notebooks with python allow you to add clear explanations without spending hours trying to decipher what the original creator of a long SQL is doing. oh c'mon, I can appreciate wanting something to crunch numbers over RBAFR, but commenting code and 'intuitive layout' has been the bug that can't be squashed in virtually every programming language ever written.
A Python Set. It's an iterable type like a list and tuple but is defined as being a list of unique items. They are very useful for checking if a value is in a list of items or (if you Google 'Set theory' - think Venn diagrams) checking the alignment of 2 sets. For example: get the difference of the sets (say, the values in 'total set' that aren't in 'current set') and get the set of shared items, etc. It uses hash tables behind the curtains, like a dictionary, so it's very fast at doing the above operations. Cons are that order is not preserved and it's not as fast as a list to iterate over so use the right tool for the job.
yea i'd raise an exception if children are around
Wow.
Yea I mean using thread pools means you're still bound by the GIL, but that also means that speedup could be improved by getting rid of globals and side-stepping the GIL by using process pools and shared queues or something.
list_ = [3,5,3,7,8] set_ = {9, 8, 2} list_to_set = set(list_) Last object will be a set containing only unique objects, no order. I'm sure you've seen sets before Michael.
&gt; I want to build a donation platform where people can create their own profile and collect donations. (I take some small portion of that) Before you even get into the design and architecture, how much market research have you done? What are the key differences between your plan and similar services that already exist (e.g. Patreon, Gofundme, etc.), and what kind of customer would those differences be important to?
big whoop. Post code or just don't post
Also a better option when the lists get into the millions of entries.
Rdflib. I put off SPARQL for the longest time, and now im paying for it doubly so.
Depends on a lot of factors. I've had to deal with csv sets that each had millions of rows per file in an air gapped security lab. No DB tools available and no external python allowed, so I had to do set comparisons involving geocoords all in base python 2.6. Involved a lot.of trickery to make it work with the memory constraints and within a reasonable time frame. Among others, not using a csv parser turned out to be a huge help, instead I split the rows at known character intervals to extract just the tidbits I needed to check.
not before 9am this morning I hadn't. At least not as an object of study at any rate.
Not sure how much you share your queries with others, but reading things top to bottom in a notebook format is way better than reading a statement from within a table first, then jumping up to the select section to see what columns where taken from it, then go down to the where section to see the filters. And it get worse when you are joining multiple tables. I’ve been handed some queries of thousands of lines and asked to make an adjustment, think about the nightmare that must have been to understand that dump. I don’t have that problem trying to understand code in any other language, being C++, python, R, or java. Yeah, it may not solve THE problem of intuitive and organic code, but it’s a hell of an improvement for sure. I’m not advocating to replace SQL by python, I use both, SQL for data extraction, python for operations, notebooks to share my work in a format that even a non-technical person would understand.
Very useful for many things not least of which is removing duplicates. Reading sometime: https://realpython.com/python-sets/
that was actually the site I Was reading earlier.
Good stuff. Now change up the mouse cursor so it looks like a target.
Make health, ammo, shield, etc. attributes for each tank. Throw it up on a server and implement multiplayer games with public lobbies. Boom, you've got a fun game, kinda like TagPro
Highly unlikely.
Gevent to the rescue: [http://www.gevent.org/](http://www.gevent.org/) It's magic!
just spitballing here so take anything I say with a gra... truckload of salt. You could have an app that reads the mail and used web scraping techniques to pick out the data you need. Drop that data into a data frame and then read the data out into a csv file. I don't know of any library designed to work with Access, but I know access can import csv files. There might be a way to automate that option.
God I hope so. Would love to use Python to get some scripts together for my team.
I am doing it as a hobby to better my Python. No interest making money out of it. The goal to become a better professional at workplace.
Interesting problem. Where do the tickets come from is the contents allready being stored somewhere before the email is sent and could you bypass the email? Otherwise are all emails basically the same format? Would depend on the email account I suppose but definitely ways of intercepting the email automatically and extracting contents which you could then use something like pyodbc.
I have done my market research. I am doing fast prototyping. So it don't have to work for the first time. Than I only need like 2000 USD/month to survive, I like to do it.
Just having a proper IDE would be amazing. The SKILL IDE provides some helpful features of course, but it's still a pain to work with. Half the time I just use Visual Studio Code with the SKILL extension while writing code.
You've probably noticed me reference it a lot on FB.
Not like the OP's example, but it does sting to integer division, multiplication, subtraction, etc. $x = 10; $y = "2"; $z = $x / $y; Barfs ...z is obviously 5.
Is this course something I could do in my downtime at work using an online interpreter like the [python.org/shell](https://python.org/shell) or would I need to install python on the computer? &amp;#x200B; Thanks in advance!
yes
Ammo bar and health bar good idea

Kripto-graffy Cool puzzle though.
First of all, what you did is awesome and the exact type of mindset you should have as a software engineer. But, the fact that your manager couldn't figure that you can compare 2 lists using an algorithm is concerning
Open source? Can you publish code?
&gt;do you know a better way to produce a portable exe? Make minimal VMs of the different architectures/systems you expect it to be used on, and provide those. Sort of like how things are done with RHEL vs Ubuntu vs Windows vs whatever. Also, have you tried the `--onefile` flag?

Hi all. Hope your week does well! I'm currently working on building a data pipeline for my company. The goal is to unify the way we are creating our Data Science Job by divided our Job in several tasks and create pipelines with those tasks. I'm benchmarking right now the framework Kedro (https://pypi.org/project/kedro/) . He looks perfect for our needs with a lot of features (pipeline management, logging, profiling, data io management, etc...). It's a newly released framework. If somebody had worked on the same problematic or with this framework I will be please to have a quick chat :) !
/r/learnpython is a better place for your question :)
Hey im. Ew as well.U could make list like this mylist = [Coz, toz, hoz, ooz] Then select the index for what u want. Index starts from 0, so Coz would be 0, toz is 1, hoz is 3,etc... Now call which index u want. Say you need to get toz.... The function to call and display the result is Print("cu, "+mylist[1]) Then it will display cu, toz.
Sure, here it is. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=vkA1cWN4DEc
What are you using to make this?
thanks a lot!
How about a telegram bot that posts the output?
Yes, I use the `--onefile` flag.
It looks like you are using pygame. You can use pygame to set cursors: https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/mouse.html#pygame.mouse.set_cursor. However, this only allows you to set black and white cursors. If you want to use color images for your cursors, make the cursor transparent, then blit and image to the location of the cursor, like this: pygame.mouse.set_cursor((8, 8), (0, 0), (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0), (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)) image = pygame.image.load('./myCursor.png').convert_alpha() while True: # Your code here screen.blit(image, pygame.mouse.get_pos()) pygame.display.update()
Don't get you? The main objective is to post media on a private telegram channel to a gallery like site for others to view. I have permission to do this.
Now you also need a hitbox.
I can't see exactly in the video, but it looks like (and I'm really assuming based on other python games) they're using pygame. This seems to be the most popular game creation tool.
Do a telegram bot that is in the channels and then posts the data you need to an API or a hosting etc, which can then be scraped/index in the site. Is it more clear now?
Oh yeah I gotcha, thanks. Only problem is I'm not the admin so I'm gonna have to convince all 3 to add the not and that its not a virus or smth
Yeah, other option would be to use your user if you're in already
Any idea where I can learn to do that exactly or pay someone to?
okay... I mean while I'm pursuing a degree in computer science and software development, no one else in the department is, or has any approaching a degree dealing with algorithms. I mean hell, 2 of the people here don't even have high school degrees. So... why should the manager expect us to be able to formulate and execute algorithms? I mean don't get me wrong, that pretty much exactly what I am working toward being able to reliably accomplish... but the majority of the work here is physical, not data based. I don't know of any algorithms that can change 192 dims and 256 hard drives in a day.
That's pretty decent. There's a tank game on Wii play that pretty much has the same basic game play (plus the addition of bombs). You're not too far off from it. Just need AI and level design.
Fair enough. I guess I assumed it was a somewhat technical department.
But hard tip see your code, looks fun though.
Ammo should bounce off the walls

Not really , you can try Google or freelance job platforms or even fivver. Depending how urgent you can also do it yourself.

With Pygame it's quite easy.
Yeap.. this is what I eventually did. It is very comfortable !

Hi sounds like your are working on an cool project. Your tools looks like something we are looking for in my company. We want to unify our Data Science and build them with a unique data science job pipeline framework. I'm currently benchmarking several solutions. What the stage of your project? Under development? Ready to be test? I'm really happy to found your github repo. I will stay tuned ;)
Yea its reali easi to use
Something visual I might suggest is a small "splash" when the bullets hit the wall, just something to offset the bullet just disappearing. Would look nice I think.
This is just experiment droving grapics taked me like 10 min. i stil have a lot to lern about coding.
No i hed 17 today steel unaploied am just lerning python in my free time
maybe you can try raspberry pi to control some servos or maybe a small motor to take out the garbage. since it runs on raspberry, you can easily bridge between devices with python itself
Wont be thet dificult thought
Possibly, if you were to spawn a small explosion sprite at the point of impact as the bullet lands, it would totally cover the impact! You would have to create an explosion sprite, which wouldn't be the easiest thing. Also not very valuable to you probably, since you've already built one sprite, making another might not be all that informative
If i can somehow get the cordnets where the bullet wos when the bullet.kill() happends it would be reali eazy to use them es rext center of explosion
Very true!
Man, I wish I could even get interviewed for a Python position. But alas, no one will even look at your resume without $50k+ in student loan debt.
Bou i have no idea how to get the cordnets
Wont be hard vith perfect colizion but my bulets dont fli for ewer

Great to hear that it worked out!
sympy for symbolic math in python
Bullet reflection off of walls
I like to call out the set syntax there -- you're using curly brackets but it's not a dictionary because you've not given it key: value pairs for items.
Install linux
Duplicated unique IDs is going to be a headache any way you do it, really. It *does* appear in both lists. If you search for it *is* there in both lists and so on. Putting it into a set might be useful, in fact, because in your sanity checks you go "hang on, len()'s saying something funny"
1. /r/learnpython 2. Why?
Have you, though? If the same asset appears on the list twice it seems fine if you've checked it once.
source?
From the Jupyter home page (`/tree`), you can click on the "New" menu and select "Terminal". That will get you a shell with the same environment settings that the Jupyter server is running under, and Anaconda should work. Inside a Jupyter notebook, I don't know a way to get a shell prompt directly. But in any Python code cell, you can use an exclamation point to send commands to the shell as that cell runs. Try, e.g., `!ls`. More details at https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/01.05-ipython-and-shell-commands.html.
google "python venv python_d" and you get this: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55380296/how-to-fix-error-errno-2-no-such-file-or-directory-c-program-files-pytho
The extreme example is if *everything* was a duplicate: imagine you were given ten copies of the list so you have 3000 odd rows but it's just ten copies of the same 300 rows. You wouldn't go round every machine 10 times. It's the same situation if there's only one duplicate. If it's on the final list at all then it's done, you've got that machine.
wow. Thank you so much. I honestly did google for it, and only found one unanswered question on SO related to python_d. Thank you for the help!
Is it just me or are the tank treads going backwards
Sorry I'm not that smart when it comes to anything (it took me 3 years to pass algebra) I thought it was with python I guess not
Have you, though? If the same asset appears on the list twice it seems fine if you've checked it once. As long as the set of assets to be checked is the same as the set of assets that were checked you're golden. You've not missed anything.
See you on the battle filed.

Atom never works for me. The Python keywords dont light up.. help plz
Well I wouldn't recommend it for the latest high performance top end development necessarily (although many of the big game houses do use a lot of virtualized workstations) but for corporate development I don't see much difference in performance between my high specification MacBook Pro and a decent specification AWS Workspace (providing the is excellent network performance). YMMV.

Nice! What theme are you using? It looks like you are on VSCode but could be wrong.
You're welcome! Sometimes the most obvious answers are the hardest to find :)

huh? this might be it....
Online multiplayer games like .io games involve a lot more moving parts than a singleplayer game. - Hosting: you need a computer on the public internet that users can connect to. [repl.it](https://repl.it) will host projects for you, and even give you a domain name (YourProjectName--YourUsername.repl.it or similar). - A webserver: once the user's browser connects, your program needs to send them a webpage with the client-side part of your game. Look at [Flask](https://pypi.org/project/Flask/) for a simple Python webserver library. - The game client: the part of your game that runs in the user's browser and reads key input, draws graphics, etc. As it's a webpage, this has to be written in JavaScript; there is a Python interpreter written in JS, which would technically allow you to write it in Python, but I doubt you'll get good performance out of it. - The game server: recieve updates from clients, move players tanks around in the world, and keep all clients in sync about where everyone else is in the world. Some of this will be the same as your current code, but the networking part will be new. - Communication between the client and server: the client needs to talk to the server, and vice versa, multiple times per second. Take a look at websockets ([JS docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API), [Python package](https://pypi.org/project/Flask-Sockets/)) for this. Definitely not as simple as "just throw it up on a server and implement multiplayer," but very doable over a summer break. Good luck and have fun!
If not ammo and you want unlimited, you could do weapon overheating to limit spamming fire or do limited magazine sizes with unlimited delayed reloads. After enemies are implemented, you can add either health regen or pickups as well as armour pickups.
I'm starting to work on a new project building that is going to receive tons of data from different instruments everyday. Right know we are in planing phase but im building an .CSV reader beforehand to see what problems start popping up in the path.
Writing some code to handle log file aggregation on AWS for my start-up - we launched a [new web site for it this week too](https://waterbear.cloud).
You need Lootboxes..
It's Pygame as others have pointed out. r/pygame is a great subreddit too, btw.
&gt; Whot would i do next? Learn how to record your screen?
Three game modes: direct shot, curved shots, and bouncing shots (less damage per bounce).
Working on a system that can automatically benchmark computer components.
How the hell would that work?
I see you are using windows. Use Xbox game bar app to record your gameplay for posting for future times. It will be in better quality
The python subreddit might not be the best place to ask
Built a [small script t](https://gist.github.com/Kamuish/3b2f7c58e57d4ff9b2ec9f716403e521)o download the current photo from the NASA's photo of the day website and set it to be the wallpaper of my computer.
sounds effects !!!! =D
/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/ is the correct location for global packages in python 3
I feel like there's something there with AI and linguistic analysis.
Really interesting seeing that someone is working on this. I was thinking about something similar recently in the context of creating a thermal model for a house. What was your motivation for collecting this data? Other measurements I thought about were the solar load and the power consumption of the AC.
=Countif is a lifesaver or vlookup
Reminds me of Tron
The algorithm gives you a score which is basically how attractive, desireable, and picky you are. The higher your ranking, the more attractive, responsive, and better your matches are. Every time you swipe left, your score goes up. When you swipe right, your score goes down. When someone likes you and you swipe left, it goes up a lot, and if you super like someone who doesn't respond, it goes down. So by swiping right, it is telling Tinder you're not picky and will be matched with absolutely anyone so they won't even show you some people.
To be fair to him that's a similar question the military asked me -- "Are you a terrorist Y/N?".
Ammo types you can pick up. One that can bounce off walls, one that's wider, one that curves and could go around a corner.
Program a randomized obstacle/block/building to be explosive when you create hit points! Forces the player to be a better driver. More challenge.
Finishing a port/upgrade of my twitter bot to python 3 from 2. Hopefully it'll be done in the next couple of days and I can test out a new visualization with it, to get a better understanding of how 'real' an event is. After that it'll be time for raspberry pi upgrades and maintenance.
forget about comments about visuals. Add multiplayer
You mean the language Python is written in? The most widely used implementation, anyway.
I’d swipe right on this comment.

&gt;They are there to impart and update their wisdom. So don't be afraid to even ask the dumbest question. &gt; &gt;**Gotchas** &gt; &gt;When someone makes you feel low or laugh at you for not knowing this. Walk up to one of the organizers or volunteers and file a complaint. They need to blacklisted for such behavior. It is the norm in most communities. Bit extreme don't you think? The industry is small. I'm sure that person wouldn't have gone around giving you grief afterwards. You just made an enemy who is older and wiser than you, possibly who has some clout in the industry, certainly more than you. You will carry that around that people can't be themselves around you and that you are a difficult person to work with.
Python 3 requires print statements to be surrounded by parentheses. try replacing &lt;code&gt; print "the temperature in C is:", cel &lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;print("the temperature in C is:", cel)&lt;/code&gt;
/r/learnpython and read the sidebar But goddamn, man, you couldn't google something like "python tutorials" or "python learning resources"?
YT, Sentdex and Corey Schafer are brilliant. Tutorialspoint for tutorials. Read the goddamn docs, try to teach yourself some discipline. And the mighty StackOverflow (Just try to really understand the shit you copy and paste from there)
&gt;$w = $x / 0; &gt; &gt;w is obviously 0 You've said this before, but it's also not true. Division by zero dies (fatal runtime failure) in Perl even without enabling `strict`. Perhaps you're confused with [Pony](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/issues/18)?
Use an engine or a proper programming language that can actually being used to create games. Python's not meant for games. If you still like the syntax and hoz mucg easy it was, change it to lua. If you actually played with low level programming languages, use C/Cpp, Java, C#, Rust. Everything's fine. Good luck mate.
Microtransactions of course.
selenium is your friend
Ok cool! Could you do that.. if you do it could be just real simple and just what it looks like on the txt file.. then I should be able to tinker and reverse engineer from there! Thanks man!

You could use one of the standard Python libraries poplib or imaplib to get the emails, or possibly selenium if your outlook is web-based. Then you could use Python with an ODBC connection to insert the data into Access.
Ricochet bullet powerup =p
Seems pretty tough. The ascii art image is such a rough approximation of the original, you lose so much information. The only solution that i could think of would rely pretty heavily on AI
Make bullets bounce
Make one of the blue square turn red randomly, which will lower your health, then a green pillar for health
Sure, go for it.
Hello! I'm a bot! It looks to me like your post might be better suited for r/learnpython, a sub geared towards questions and learning more about python. That said, I am a bot and it is hard to tell. Please follow the subs rules and guidelines when you do post there, it'll help you get better answers faster. Show /r/learnpython the code you have tried and describe where you are stuck. **[Be sure to format your code for reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/faq#wiki_how_do_i_format_code.3F)** and include which version of python and what OS you are using. You can also ask this question in the [Python discord](https://discord.gg/3Abzge7), a large, friendly community focused around the Python programming language, open to those who wish to learn the language or improve their skills, as well as those looking to help others. *** [^(README)](https://github.com/CrakeNotSnowman/redditPythonHelper) ^(|) [^(FAQ)](https://github.com/CrakeNotSnowman/redditPythonHelper/blob/master/FAQ.md) ^(|) ^(this bot is written and managed by /u/IAmKindOfCreative) ^(This bot is currently under development and experiencing changes to improve its usefulness)
Add an antagonist. (Also this is dope as fuck and you should be real proud already.)
Maybe learn how to take a video from the computer itself.
this is why I like traditional threaded programming. You spawn a few threads, and while they aren't going to be parallel with the GIL, they \*will\* be doing things concurrently, no matter what it is you have them doing, because the OS is going to preemptively context switch. With event based approaches, it's pretty easy to screw up and just be all on one task, or to have the tasks work in this bumpy, jerky way as one of them does a bunch of stuff, it might get caught blocking on file IO or something, I don't really see how it's worth it.

What is the error you are receiving.
Yah this is pretty comprehensive imo and will give op a taste of the full stack. I remember a similar project I did when I was a novice and it taught me so much, so many aspects as you've listed
Because: You're not posting it in /r/learnpython You didn't format it for reddit You didn't post the error You didn't tell us what the expected v. actual behavior is
Thank you where are the discord links I'll check the about section
Is there any specific question you'd like to ask?
I'd probably make the front of the tank more obvious, it seems like it'll be easy to lose track of the orientation of the tank
I've been a Python developer for a while now. I never got the chance to put something to PyPI. This time I committed and finished it. PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/pydoro/ Asciinema: https://asciinema.org/a/251825 Github: https://github.com/JaDogg/pydoro Suggestions, Code Reviews, PRs anything is welcome.
I would but I don't even know where to start lol

Looks great! But without the code, how will we know??
It's Saturday, the offer still valid?
i'm currently working this and i'm trying to add editing a post and removing a post and research tho i am not sure how to go exachtly about it i have search googled and other sites. http://dpaste.com/3K6YCHB is my app source
I want to learn how to do this where would I start?
Thanks for the suggestions!
That's cool man, I love simple tank games. This kinda reminds me of the old online Tanks game where you'd basically launch a single shot at each other's tanks until one was destroyed.
I laughed my ass off, thank you.
I came to say the same thing
PyCharm is pretty great.
If I'm understanding you correctly, it seems like you might benefit from using SQLAlchemy in your project. Here are some links to help you get started https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=VSzNYfDQp8Y https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4926757/sqlalchemy-query-where-a-column-contains-a-substring#19654702
