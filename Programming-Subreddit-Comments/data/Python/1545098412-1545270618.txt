Poetry solved all the issues I had with dependency management in python. Just use pyenv to manage interpreters and virtualenvs, then `poetry init` / `poetry add &lt;dep&gt;`, and it just works. Poetry also autogenerates package metadata for distribution, which can be used with shiv to generate self contained packages. Python tooling has evolved a lot from the bare pip days.
I ask questions online all the time about Python. This is because I am not a good programmer. I’m exclusively self taught and using just snippets of code and scripts to automate certain things in day to day work life. The reason I use Python is because it’s easy enough to understand for a complete newbie programmer while advanced enough to do a lot of interesting things. So I google or raise questions constantly to make scripts work and to learn some more as I plod along and write code. Just yesterday I was googling “python selenium how to interact with browser without it being an active window” and promptly learned about —headless browser modes :)
Question to ask is really: are questions on stackoverflow specifically about python or about how to use the many libraries python offers? While python itself isn’t that new there are many libraries that are, which then generate questions about the library and not the core of python. Though on stackoverflow it might all be rolled up as “python questions” in general.
It is impossible to determine the area and it could take any real value (adapt this method https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1459506/intuition-about-open-cover-of-mathbb-q-of-arbitrary-small-measure). 
I agree, this does not seem possible.
The fact that OS X will convert an excel file to a numbers file has nothing to do with what pandas can read. 
You could start by learning the meaning of the words "opinion" and "option".
I would add use of language by non-programmers. I am a researcher, who does fairly heavy duty data analysis and algorithm type work. I have used Matlab, C, C++, R, Visual Basic, bash scripting for various small scripting. I find python very intuitive and I tend to write more 'complete' code, with more automation (things for which I would have written a bash script or stitched things together manually). Thanks to python I am currently at a point where I have almost at one click reproducible results from raw data. I don't consider myself a programmer, but over the past three-four years I have learned a lot of programming principles and have troubleshot some quirks of the packages I use by asking and reading stackexchange. I believe there are a lot of folks like me contributing to the stackexchange stats.
How delayed is Alpaca's data, 15min?
People want the language with the most support
Well... in practice might assume that the region becomes "convex" at a sufficiently small level of granuality. I.e. | x - y | &lt; g, f(x) = 1, f(y) = 1 =&gt; f(ax + by) = 1 for a, b &gt; 0 a + b = 1 
One thing to keep in mind when reading my responses is that we are not in the same place in our careers and so my prospects and yours are likely to vary drastically. &gt; Which area in the country hires Py devs more? If I need to relocate somewhere other than CA or NY where would the next place be where python is a popular language? Increasingly anywhere, but major cities are obviously still going to be your best bet (especially if you're picky about environment, which I hope you are). New York and California are absolutely not required though. Python is everywhere these days. Stick to the larger cities and just pick where you think you'd be happiest. &gt; Are remote python positions a myth? I have been a part time py dev for about 6 months and would love to keep up the trend of working remotely. My part time gig is not going to be there for much longer so I need to find something full time. I did a little over a year remote recently and it wasn't for me, but I get offers for remote work fairly consistently. I think remote is becoming more and more prevalent and if that is what you want to do it is absolutely a viable avenue. I do not know how much remote work exists on the more junior side and suspect that this is an area where my own prospects and yours diverge significantly (read: I wouldn't hire a remote junior dev). &gt; Other than Data science, which areas of the language are the most popular? Web and administrative scripting (for example, devops specialists use scripting languages a lot). &gt; I am breaking into the career and while I have been coding for a few years and have legitimately been working as a dev for 6 months, development is not what my current career is based on. What would be a reasonable salary expectation on average? I know this will vary depending on location. But I also know the salary specs online can be misleading at times. Depends on where you live and what you're doing. If you've been working successfully as a developer for 6 months I'd expect that you'd be taking a junior developer role (and looking desperately to get out from the "junior" title). For a junior developer, dependent on a ton of things, I'd consider $42-$60k appropriate.
Use [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) to publish ([client library](https://github.com/prometheus/client_python)) and collect+store (server) the time-series data, and [Grafana](https://grafana.com) to make dashboards. You'll then be in a position to easily start collecting, monitoring, and alerting on many more metrics, from your service, the system, the network, and more.
I want to expand on the second point (remote work as a junior developer) just a little. I'd avoid working remote as much as possible unless you're part of a larger team that can aid your growth. It is incredibly easy to pick up bad habits when you are growing in isolation. There is a lot to be said about being in the same room as the other developers. It is an experience that I've always found lacking when working remote.
Thank you, I need to scrape a BSR and price.
I suggest you write your program like so: how_about_you_learn_some_measure_theory.py: def area(f): return random.random(0, 1) 
It is real-time
Did you talk about .Net Frame or even MSDN? I have not found new docs site as good as old MSDN site
If you find it useful, do it. If you do it then maybe someone will use it. With projects like this, you have to be _very_ useful before it'll begin to gain traction (developers are stubborn and generally hate change). But the answer to "would you like better project management?" is always going to be "yes". So yeah, make it, improve it, grow it, market it, do it! But don't look for others to validate your ideas. If you find your ideas useful, then use them. If you're interested in people using your packages, then polish them. Take the Kenneth Reitz approach and inject a little bit of hubris into your life. Don't ask us what we'd find useful. Make a thing then tell us we'll find it useful.
Awesome idea sharing knowledge really helps a lot :)
Ah that was a typo, no idea why I used "opinion" instead of "options"
&gt; But don't look for others to validate your ideas What about looking for others to *invalidate* your ideas, for example so you stop doing stupid things :)? A wonderful way of having confidence in your ideas is if they can survive the invalidation of dozens of intelligent people. &gt; Take the Kenneth Reitz approach and inject a little bit of hubris into your life. :) I would characertise this more as "people don't really know what they want" and "people often don't think very hard about things". It's a bit different from hubris, other people aren't wrong, just lazy. 
bokeh could probably do this.
You need to export your .numbers file to a readable format for Pandas. Here are the one supported : Like you can see, .numbers is not one of them.
The winning PEP mentions: &gt; we don't want to go through this kind of crisis again Can someone fill me in on what sort of crisis has struck Python and asked for this whole lof ot 801x PEPs to be drafted? Thanks in advance for any knowledgeable folk that might feel up to the task!

If I want to scrape the first 500 rankings what do I need to code to limit the scrape to that instead of scraping all rankings?
Python is a tool, You can use this tool in any industry that uses computers - so all industries. Your question is kind of like asking what jobs people use pens for. Lots of jobs. Currently I'm a scientific programmer for Environment Canada. Some of the code we submit to the supercomputer for numerical weather prediction and environment modelling is Python.
That doesn't make sense if you consider most of the time people are asking questions about poorly documented packages. 
What about cyclical references? Eg: class A: def foo(val: B): pass class B: def foo(val: A): pass How would you make this work? 
Bravo!
Python 4 is a long ways off. RIP Python 2.7
Writing unit tests for a lightweight oracle ORM that does all modeling using dynamic class attribute names. This allows for an ORM that requires no writing of classes for each table. One class handles everything
Use the `split()` method to separate the file into sections. sections = file_data.split('Input from') Then use the `find` method to find the first "First" and the newline after it. --- If you have more questions like this it's better to post them on /r/learnpython. Be sure to [format your code for reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/faq#wiki_how_do_i_format_code.3F) or use a site like pastebin. Also, include which version of python and what OS you are using. 
Every time this question is asked we point to this old answer: [No. Python3 -&gt; python4 will be as uneventful as python1 -&gt; python2](http://www.curiousefficiency.org/posts/2014/08/python-4000.html). That said it's an old answer, and the BDFL is now BDFL emeritus, so who knows? 
I write python for a company creating software for digital marketing
Most of my work in the past months has been a self auditing automation framework for IT operations with some extras like internal web portals and stuff, there is also a CLI tool but that's in PowerShell. Most of the framework is Python (with Django and Flask) and only a bit in .NET.
Can I ask an honest question? How is that really worth? I mean, I don't think writing the classes for each table could take SO much time that it's worth to build an ORM to abstract that. I could be wrong. Any insight on that?
Its nice when your ETL processes deal with tables containing sometimes 50 columns. Having abstracted code to eliminate lots of inline sql or extraneous python classes is nice
Currently running a flask application to handle CRUD stuff and ETL for creel sampling of fishermen. Various projects with pandas, sci-kit learn, seaborn, matplotlib working with the data. I like using flask to develop web applications that give non-technical people access to the stat work I do. 
I guess that does makes sense. Never had to deal with so complex classes.
There are other reasons too specific to some of our legacy code, but this was a main one. From a pure code standpoint it’s nice to be able to do something like this: with Database() as db: phonebook = db.model(“phonebook”) phonebook.mapping phonebook.columns phonebook.save(number=“555-555-5555”, name=“Jane Doe”) rather than writing a whole class for the phonebook table, defining all of the types, etc 
I've built a fairly large and complex system with pyzmq and really enjoyed it. I did have to write a fair amount of wrapper code around it, it is a fairly low level library after all. It's one of my favorite pieces of software, and I figured that if it was good enough for jupyter, it was good enough for me. Just for comparison, the application that I and my teammate built was an automated quality control application in an assembly line that had to collect, process, and save data as quickly as possible, and a lot of it. We ended up with 6 processes, a central controller, the interface with the assembly line IO, the interface with the measurement equipment, the data processing system, the data storage system, a gui (that could be connected from anywhere in the world with multiple concurrent connections possible, the was awesome), and a technician's tool for manual control and calibration. It was a very complex system by its very nature, but also very extensible, flexible, and robust. The central controller ensured everything was connected correctly, passing around connection info and restarting processes if they failed or lived too long. Each process acted essentially as a state machine, and could be tested in isolation. This let us separate the "business logic" very cleanly from the IO, since it's hard to fit an assembly line on your desk. Pyzmq made it all possible and stayed out of our way. The patterns that come in the library dictate how to build your app, but are also pretty comprehensive. They can be tricky to work with at times, but once you get it figured out it works like a charm. Pubsub ended up being the best, since that's what let us have multiple HUDs remotely connected to the same system. It just blasted events out and whoever got them, got them. Not only was this useful, but it was impressive to management that we could log in to a line in China in real time. Yet that was the easiest part to build. Pyzmq made it possible for us to build this crazy complicated system and actually have it work. We had more features than the previous attempt by a different team, in less than half the time, with much higher robustness. It was testable, adaptable, and powerful. Probably my most fun project ever, and it depended on Pyzmq heavily in its core. I would happily use it again for any project that needed high concurrency. 
u/Zulban said it best - it's a tool that you can use for a ton of stuff. For instance, I'm taking an electronics course and I used it to model some basic RC circuits stuff I was trying to understand better. Also, Reddit's backends are primarily built on Python so I get to use it at work too.
Python Dash ? It's built over flask, and D3. No HTML, JavaScript required. I recently created dash app to measure CPU, mem, network stats of container where heroku app is hosted.. Link - dash-on-heroku.herokuapp.com
Since you've been so helpful, a couple more questions specific to my project (which is conceptually similar to `contacts.py`): 1. How do I get the `**kwargs` for making a text box be disabled work? In the line `head.add_widget(Text("Name:", "name", disabled=True), 1)`, I can't seem to find the proper placement and syntax to add that. 2. Related to 1, what I'd really like to do is on my analogue `ContactView` is to have the title of the view be `Editing &lt;record name&gt;`, but it seems that the screen needs its title to be set in its init method and there isn't a clear way to change it. I saw a GitHub issue about this, but it doesn't look like it's been carried across to the documentation (at least on read the docs) 3. Is there a way to have a text field or text box display an automatically-updated number on the right side? What I'm thinking of is using the text box to type a record name (or text box for multiple records) and then using the number to display the record ID. A MultiColumnListBox works fine for selecting records, but isn't a text input field.
Thanks! I think HTML is indeed optional as one can just use the HTML in the samples to build similar style dashboards. Also thanks for the example. I'm actually trying to build something similar (about products instead of CPU info)

I'm currently working on a 3-dimensional geometry tool to be used by the mining modelling field. I'm making the project all by myself so it's kinda different from the majority of cases. As a Mechanical Engineer, python has become my vital work tool, so don't think that programming is just for Computer Science people. 
I'm a systems engineer working in AWS. I use python for everything from simple monitoring scripts on our servers to provisioning resources in the cloud. In particular I use the boto3 library to interface with AWS services, mostly launching servers and modifying dns records and the like. For monitoring I generally plug into an api and look for a response or scan a web page for certain text. I know that's not quite development, but I thought I'd point out that it's an option, since it seems like a lot of people don't consider infrastructure engineering when working on a cs degree. If I have any more specific questions I'm happy to answer as I can.
Yeah pandas or xlrd (the package what pandas is using to read the file) has no idea what a .numbers file is. https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/f74fc59793ce1f01e1afcdd29bcdf0dceccaf244/pandas/io/excel.py
DevOps: I mainly use it for scripting. It makes life easy with it’s core set of libraries and they all run extremely fast.
I use python for analyzing emails for improving client service for a large US investment bank. Putin though awesome for exploratory stuff and POC, is a pain in the ass to deploy especially in the legacy environment.
Software engineer in the marine industry here. I use it to crunch gigabytes of CAN data. Basically creating plots and statistics from sensor signals looking for weird behavior. Python with pandas is great for that kind of stuff. 
i think you're over-thinking things. installing from the distribution repo is not a problem at all &gt; So installing via package manager and via other methods ( say compiling) result in potentially breaking differences. It all feels like a strange mess. that goes for any piece of software you choose to install. it's not unique to python. you should install from a different source only if you know what you're doing and why you're doing it 
I work on a team that makes debug and automation tools for semiconductor manufacturing tests. The GUIs are Python (wx), our public APIs are Python, and our unit tests are Python. The backend interfaces to the test machines are Python in some cases, and C++ for heavy lifting. I am a developer on the team - I help enable new silicon designs in our tools when they hit the test labs, I help develop new features in our tools, I help design new tools to solve the problems of manufacturing testing. It's fun. Every day is a new challenge, every new design brings new communication protocols we have to support in our tools (JTAG, DDR, STF, SPI, I2C, etc.). Our users come up with new test methods, or they want to collect data in a different way. I've used what I've learned at work to enhance my personal projects. I also take what I learn in my personal projects to work to improve our code base. 
&gt; Python dependency management is such a terrible mess. Its the main reason why I don't like to use python (after having tried to write a few simple things with it). what problems do you have? it should be pretty straight forward nowadays &gt; But pretty much, you do 'npm install some-fancy-library' and you basically can start using it in your code. how is that different than pip install? &gt; I think its supposed to be also that easy in Python, but somehow that has not been my experience. And so while programming in python is mostly fun... the whole dependcy management hell that came with it just ruined that for me. you haven't used many other languages besides python and javascript have you?

Not really. What Emacs or Vim offer is a vastly better ergonomics compared to any other place you need to edit text. If you cannot take advantage of that aspect, then Emacs would be a hard sell. I cannot compare to Wunderlist because I don't use software like that in general. The only kind of tasks management software I do use is the one that is used in software development for bug tracking, i.e. JIRA, Trac, Redmine etc. They are so limited compared to `org-mode` that I would not even consider replacing one with another. They are used though because they offer a way to collaborate and to store a lot of information in a compact form--things you don't care about in a personal organizer. As for configuration: I wouldn't say so. It depends on how well you know your tools. The last time I touched my `init.el` was couple months ago, and the edits I made were the new email address and a fix to some Python string formatting code I wrote about a year ago. (I know this because my configuration is under version control). I think I spent more time ten years ago configuring Emacs, but I cannot trace it that far back. What does take time is learning how to use the tools. Here, Emacs would definitely lose to something like PyCharm. But, you can argue that there's just objective not that much to know about PyCharm in the first place, so no wonder it takes so long for Emacs. Or, a different way to put it: if you had to sell a math textbook to elementary / mid / high-school students, based on *their* preferences, then the book would probably cover only topics like addition and subtraction... maybe multiplication. You'd never get to calculus or trigonometry. So, PyCharm or VSCode in this metaphor would be the book designed to please the audience with very little actual value, where their selling point is their appeal to laziness and lack of interest on the part of the consumer.

Writing a proof of concept desktop application for linux. I was given no requirements other than make it look nice, include a section for user details, and a section to house self-help utilities. Not too thrilled about it because this is my first time working with python, and I get to use it for the one thing it does horribly (GUI’s). The project managers also don’t seem to understand what they want or who even needs it, more so just to have another project under their belts before year end reviews. Just going to try getting something together with Kivy or PyQt5 since we have a commercial license. 
Computational neuroscience research involving a fair amount of machine learning. I work a lot with scipy, scikit-learn, xarray and bokeh (for visualization). Even though in research nobody cares if you just write quick and dirty code that only works for you, I try to package my code from the start with the proper tests and documentation. One of the packages I've open-sourced even has a couple of users now: [sklearn-xarray](https://github.com/phausamann/sklearn-xarray)
I was tired of doing basic EE math for some transistor circuits that show up a few dozen times in my projects, so I wrote a little script to calculate all the resistors in the circuit block given the type of transistor, load current, power rail, and TTL levels.
Sure... In order: 1. Disabled is a property of the Widget, which cannot be set on construction. Just set the property on the object after construction, then add it to the layout. 2. Just set the title property: https://asciimatics.readthedocs.io/en/stable/asciimatics.html#asciimatics.widgets.Frame.title 3. I'm not quite sure of the use case here. Is it to show the number of the currently selected field, or do you want to change the selected field based on what is typed into the text box? Either way what you want is some callbacks to handle the on_change event. If you want to discuss more, fell free to grab me on gitter at https://gitter.im/asciimatics/Lobby.
Learning how to correctly package a python application, with version handling by git integration, dependency management, private python package index (devpi) are some of the important aspects that were certainly not covered in uni. Apart from that it's just writing clear, well designed code, just like any other language out there, except &lt;MEME&gt; lang of course..

I would think cities like Austin, Portland, Denver are the next in line to become tech hubs. One idea would be to check with Python dev meetups in those cities on [meetup.com](https://meetup.com) and pose your questions in a forum or something. \&gt;&gt; Other than Data science, which areas of the language are the most popular? I've seen a huge demand for full stack developer roles, Django but it also requires knowledge of javascript and things like node. js etc.

I've been finishing up a 4,500 word article called [Python and Django Logging in Plain English](https://djangodeconstructed.com/2018/12/18/django-and-python-logging-in-plain-english/)! I've spent waaaaaaay too many hours reading logging source code, so I'm excited to get back to actually making things and not just writing about them.
So I wrote a lot of code for different audit procedures across the board but the script is never performing the audit. It's either collecting the support or cleansing/massaging the data. Things like that.

Hey dude, quick question: is knowing python a requirement in your team ? i do something very similar at the company im at, that is to provision servers on rackspace using the openstack SDK and updating DNS if required, alongside monitoring and playing around with APIs for any integration work. I ask cause it sucks being the only person knowledgeable in the team with regards to Python, especially when the requirements can be vague as to what needs to be done.

I use numpy, pandas, and sympy. But what scipy is used for?
It used to be required, to set later defined classes in quotes to enable the type checking. I think it's no longer necessary class A: def foo(Val: 'B') -&gt; 'B': return Val() class B: def foo(Val: A) -&gt; A: return Val() BTW, your example should return an instance of "Val", otherwise passing in "Val" would be pointless
If you look at the graph of question count, you can see that the number of java questions goes down during semester holiday periods, where as Python doesn't show this behavior. This leads to the assumption, that students asks more Java questions and Python is more independent from the study cycle. 
You have something there, Pandas mindset is very different from Python and some ways of doing things are horribly difficult to get to work. I don't see Python tank as a general programming language, though, because of all the library support. It's more likely that Python's big weaknesses in GUI &amp; mobile device support go away now that Qt is actively pushing Qt for Python. The other thing is Jupyter Notebooks and the pressure to get Python into Microsoft Excel. All that data sciency stuff happens in a world that doesn't chase the next shiny as much as other fields. And it's looking more like it that Python will rule that field for a long time.
I'm working on a discord bot which runs along side a web server and python script in the user's end which allows them to control their computer using discord commands. Specifically, for a game called "Rust" (r/playrust) to tell them if their being raided from their phone. &amp;#x200B; Its my first major project (more like first project period) and its a great learning experience, learning python, python libraries like [discord.py](https://discord.py), asyncio, opencv, numpy, PIL, pytesseract, pyautogui, aiohttp, requests (and more!), as well as other languages like PHP and SQL. What was supposed to be a little mini project blew up real fast and I'm having a ton of fun working on it.

Load csv as pandas dataframe and then you can groupby/pivot and plot the result.
What are you trying to do exactly? Do you just want a webpage that has authentication?
* An [Open Service Broker](https://www.openservicebrokerapi.org/) that runs on Flask + Celery, which exposes my teams services as self-service APIs * An extensible management server for [Envoy](https://www.envoyproxy.io/), an open-source Edge proxy and service mesh
yes, but i want to make sure it cannot be attacked using cross site attacks i have a rough understanding of basic authentication but the posts ive read say they are vulnerable to cross site attacks or possibly cookie stealing.
System engineer.. Use python for one click daily task.. Ez..
All you need is HTTP basic auth and the right CORS headers.
But it's based on java not python? Why did you post it on the Python subreddit? 
Definitely Sentdex. He does amazing AI projects. He built an AI that rides a motorcycle through GTA V. But Dan Bader is also very amazing if you are into learning about python core parts. He has a great blog where he dives deep into subjects. 
will the correct cors heading prevent XSS im assuming?
Yes.
lovely thank you for the advice, its much appreciated.
Not currently working in Python, as I switch languages and context very frequently in my job, but last project in Python was a web/rss/atom scraper with sentiment analysis. It would loop a list of URLs and scrape them 3 lvls deep (scrape a page, find the list of links on this page, scrape every link, find the list of links on each page, etc) with Scrapy, and pass the text through Google Sentiment Analysis API. You can do lots of things with this, but I looked for specific brands and keywords so I got a general opinion of each. &amp;#x200B; This is really easy and was my second project in Python. If you know a bit of CSS selectors/DOM/XPATH and how to do http requests you are good to go.
There was an amazing Kaggle challenge I really liked, that aimed to build an AI that could detect toxic comments. Some of the higher tier guys even published their kernels. Could not only help you but is also very interesting to learn from. [Kaggle challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge) &amp;#x200B; The rest like fetching comments and reporting back to you should be a piece of cake as soon as you are done with the classifier.

`aiohttp` just like the `asyncio` and a bunch of other libraries that are built on it are tremendously over-engineered and, unless you are the author, impossible to debug. At least not in the sense that you will be able to understand the code flow in a reasonable time that would make it worthwhile. I'm not saying it will be a whole lot easier, but, in a long run, it will: use `urllib3` with threads (`requests` has problems with threads). You might even get better performance, who knows... but this is not the point: in Python you won't get good performance for this kind of task. The important benefit will be the ease of maintenance. PS. As an aside: if that's not a secret, where do you live? Your DNS server resolves URLs to ipv6 addresses and your whole IP stack supports it... I've not yet seen ipv6 actually used for real in the internet, only intranet.

I think OP is just trying to farm karma due to the lack of explanation.
Thanks. Problem is I need to send a http request to my web server, and requests worked fine, but it blocked my [discord.py](https://discord.py) bot, so I need to use aiohttp with asyncio. &amp;#x200B; PS. Sydney.
I'm far from professional, but I am currently doing an internship at a Health Information Exchange company building web services to connect physicians and patients with their medical records. We use many tools to accomplish this but my tasks thus far have primarily used Django. I'm still very much learning but I see practical uses for python in all technology fields. 
This worked, thanks so much, been on this for hours.
Anything CAN bus related resources you can recommend? My next project might involve consuming CAN output. 😄
XSS only makes sense if your page uses JavaScript. You don't really need JavaScript for authentication, HTTP itself already has means to do that and they are available through plain HTML.
Can you predict density of the critters at arbitrary locations? Or is it just data management?
How do you handle content from sure author and distinguish it from advertiser it user comments etc? Our for you curate sites scraped?
&gt; Sydney Well, that's interesting :) &gt; so I need to use aiohttp with asyncio. Not really. `aiohttp` *is written to solve this kind of problem*, but it's by far not the only possible solution. It is even possible that my info on the (lack of) friendship between `requests` and threads is out of date, so you could just try wrapping your existing code which calls `requests` into a thread and be done with it... I'm just not really a big fan of that library, so I wouldn't know.
I thought `nosetests` died few years ago, didn't it?
There is none that I know. Had to build it in-house. I would share it if it wasn’t done during office hours. 
how do u consume terabytes with pandas? whats the infrastructure like? i moved from pandas to spark (distributed system) because i couldnt scale with pandas.

I am currently doing a tool which will bulk scan our company's assets with qr code. Simple program which will relieve a few hundred man hours per year. 
Do you ever find Python to be too slow to solve any engineering problems?
&gt; What project are you currently working on? I run an automation department in a small startup which deals with storage (block-device level). Before this I worked for a big fin-tech company in automation department. Before than I worked for a bigger storage company (distributed file-system). Before then I worked for embedded / smart TV. Before then... &gt; How are you going about getting it done? It's less about the code, more about bureaucracy: organize, educate, negotiate, plan--that kind of stuff. On a coding level, it's a constant battle between wanting better quality in minimal time and having only half-arsed solutions provided by Python's standard library and third-parties. This amounts to arguing in emails, internal and external bug-trackers and such.
Using a single condition with an `or` is certainly a good option. Whether `"{([()something])()}")` should be considered well-formed is debatable in context, and as a rule in a job interview and indeed in a job, if the requirements are ambiguous it is probably better to *ask* than to assume.
Are the values separated by any significant character? 
To be fair I didn't control that because it was a massive list of URLs, so it was too much work to do specific scrapers for each, and the amount of data was insane (the client wanted anything related to those brands independent of the source). Anyway, you can filter irrelevant or extreme (positive and negative) opinions from the result of the analysis. If you want both a generic scraper and also distinguish between comments, ads and author content before sentiment analysis, you would have to find a standard way. I can't think of one at the moment with pure XPATH/CSS but maybe with some tool like Selenium or some browser bot you can get relevant text in the top and center of the page, for example, and ignore whatever is on the sides and bottom. I did look for duplicate URLs though, that way I didn't scrape several times the same site just because other pages contained that link.
If compiling is an option, then sure, go for it. This way you will know what you are getting and why. All Python infrastructure, especially around packaging is the swamp. If you can help it, don't go there.
You are reading the documentation for Python 2 but using Python 3. Right at the top it says \_winreg was renamed to winreg in Python 3.

heh? Nope. Xss is specifically the inclusion of third party content (cross site), in your output stream which then gets presented to your browser which in turn executes them in the security domain of your website. This has nothing to do with using javascript or not. So basically, make sure no unfiltered content can get into the browser without being escaped to become harmless text instead of potentially harmful html or javascript. &amp;#x200B; Also, You should make sure that any call that \*does\* something on your server is not a GET request (per standard), and will only function when a XSRF post argument is being send by the client which matches a cookie with the same content.
It does not. Xss [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site\_scripting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting) is about injecting harmful payloads via headers / cookies / get / post variables which end up in the output stream and which are parsed by the browser. Cors headers just allow other domains from scraping the content into their own security domain where they would normally be unable to 'read' the contents of a (javascript) requested from your domain, Cors headers can allow cross domain reading of content from for example json files.

First question, do your pdfs have text in them or are they the all-too-common pdf of pictures of pages? You can check this if you can successfully copy/paste text manually out of the pdf. If they are text, you can use tika to extract the text and then process it however you want. If they are images, you'll need to run some sort of ocr on them first.

I'm a security engineer that has multiple clients in healthcare and financial industries. Right now my main use for Python has been crawling publicly accessible web pages and API endpoints for my clients and testing security vulnerabilities. Most of this is done with `scrapy` and the `OWASP Zed Attack Proxy` API. Note that I don't exclusively use Python, it's just in my toolset along with many others (namely Node, PHP, and .Net as those are the chief technologies used by my clients).
How did you land into this type of work? (Currently doing software eng (python) for finance)
"Beautiful" Eeew no. 
Ah i see. Thanks again
Thanks so much. I feel this will help me a lot. Thanks!!!
Yes, we require a basic working knowledge of python, and we do a test or two during the interview process. I would expect that everyone on my team can sit down and write a function that can do some data manipulation and validate the inputs and outputs fairly quickly.

Chance and persistence. During my studies I did Formula Student which led me to get in contact with the company that’s doing control systems for Volvo. It seemed like the kind of place where I wanted to work so I kept myself in their view and got offered to do my thesis there doing a prototype for a remote controlled Volvo truck. Then started working in their marine segment as a software developer. Still work for the same company but got relocated from Sweden to Australia to try something new. 
Often times old systems, especially internal tooling, can be hanging on badly outdated libraries, OS, etc. If no-one is willing to pay for update work, then tough luck. Unfortunately some coders end up maintaining some pretty hairy setups.
I work on a finance team as the sole programmer. I write python to automate a lot of work that Excel can't handle by leveraging the pandas library. Several processes that used to take many hours to do in Excel are now run at a button click in Jupiter notebook. There's a lot of cool stuff you can do in python with machine learning and flask web development, but don't forget the basic jobs that python makes so much more efficient!
&gt; In Python 3.x xrange keyword is denoted by range. Neither `xrange` nor `range` are keywords. They’re just ordinary classes. Also, this tutorial is about Python 2.x, which is basically a living dinosaur nowadays. Python 3.x, on the other hand, is the present and future of the language.
What do people use nowadays?
Anything like that for Python test, Pytest or Jupiter notebook?
I'm a computational biologist by trade, but a software engineer by training. I'm currently building a system for teams to run cloud-scale analysis on top of Google Cloud. It's got a lightweight vue.js front-end on top of a python module and connected together with flask/connexion API. It's got a long ways to go before it's production ready, but I'm just taking it a bit at a time. I'm a huge fan of using GitHub issues as a development tracker, so I've opened a bunch of issues for the features which still need work and I'm just knocking them out one at a time. I'm about six months into this project and expect it to be done in late January or early February. This project is primarily aimed towards biological data, but could be used for any computation.

I work for a TV network and I'm using Python to predict Nielsen ratings. I am looking at all of the marketing activities associated with promoting our TV shows and then seeing how many people are watching. The models inputs include TV ad impressions, social media impressions, email impressions, etc. I also have a number of control variables like network, time, season #, genre, etc. I am using a combo of libraries such as pandas, numpy, seaborn, stats model, scikit and maybe some more. Model is pretty strong for one of the networks 0.85 r-square. 
It always amazes me what people are building with Python, this looks pretty neat!

I'm currently also crunching terabytes of netCDF files. I use xarray mainly, and that uses pandas and dask under the hood. Nearly everything I do is memory-limited though, so I have to come up with clever ways to reduce the data, and it's different for every question I have.
I care. I work at AIBS and and often tasked with industrializing "quick and dirty" code. For example, I often see saving data to hardcoded paths to files on a network share that down stream consumers are reading. Now I have to maintain that in production.
I've used it all. Parsing directly from sys.argv for very simple things mostly under my control; I've used the now [deprecated optparse](https://docs.python.org/2/library/optparse.html); I've used [argparse](https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/argparse.html) from which I always likes [this example](https://chase-seibert.github.io/blog/2014/03/21/python-multilevel-argparse.html). I've tried [click](https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/7.x/) and it looked nice. I think that argument parsing should not get in your way and it should be as clear as possible, otherwise your tool will become the parsing of the arguments. Help messages to me are a must, event if they just a simple *how to use* one liner - it shows other how to use and reminds you in the future.

I did a lot of work with PyQt4 a while back. Since then I've been forced into web UI dev which has been a nightmare of unstable frameworks (meaning rocky upgrades) and rapidly changing best practices. I recently tried PySide2 to see if my fond memories of desktop dev we're just due to ignorance. Nope. It's an absolute delight to work off a solid, consistent platform. I was even able to `pip install PySide2 pyinstaller gevent` and get a client/server desktop GUI application (packed as a single file executable) running on Linux, Windows, and OSX with a single PyInstaller command. I would be so happy if I could convince the people at work that we should switch, but they all drank the web UI kool-aid.

Pytest can generate JunitXML reports using the \` --junitxml=path \` flag which can be transformed into HTML reports with this plugin as well. See the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/Zir0-93/xunit-to-html) for instructions on converting the generated XML report to HTML.
Look up machine learning and specifically neural networks. Keras will be one of your best bets for a library to do this. This is a fairly difficult problem solve. 
How much does pyside implement? I have a program I’m running on pyqt5 (the other thing), and it seems to have almost everything. I did notice some of the qt modules run like crap like the qt multiprocessing stuff. Slowwww. I ended up using pythons built in multiprocessing and it’s lead to a series of deep but rare bugs. Wonder if it works better on pyside.

Wow that’s awesome. Thanks for sharing that. If you need any help on any new projects you start, I’d love to assist in whatever way I can. I have a decent foundation of python however I cant do much more than make number games or put a bunch of stuff in a data structure automatically.
I don’t work at a software company, I’m just the data whiz around the office. Word gets around so I get approached with random data quests and it’s always something different. Here’s a folder with many subfolders without structure, we need to search for hundreds of Excel workbooks and scrape data from them into one big table. We need to build a database for the next upcoming project. We need to import tons of data into this software and there’s a Python interface and I heard you can code in Python. Learning Python was the most valuable thing I ever did!

Thanks for sharing. This sounds really interesting. I’d love to learn more about this.. as far as using python with excel and finance since I actually have knowledge of the two later. So, I should check out .. Panda library Jupiter Flask Anything else?
Do we really have to skip every built in feature and write just another thing doing exactly the same? This happens in Javascript language for past several year and it became such a massive mess. Whole language. It's amost impossible to find a tiny library with 0 dependency just because people are to lazy to learn how to use native stuff. People should go for native because it saves dependency hell, it's stable, well tested and more likely to be maintained in future more than a library from Github with a few stars. It's also a standard so once someone else would like to contribute he doesn't have to go thru dependency docs and rather start working. We should learn from mistakes we already made.
Anything we could play? 
I’m looking forward to the day when I know what the hell this means lol. Thanks for sharing.
noob here. What platform apps do you build with Qt? Desktop?
The problems with the "system Python" on Linux distributions tend to fall into one of two categories. First, many distros have a lot of system tooling written in Python, and only do their full suite of integration testing against the specific Python that the distro comes with. While this *shouldn't* be a risk in well-written code, it can be a risk; if any of those system tools turned out to rely on precise versions of Python or a standard module, and you make a change, it may break the system tools. This happened a little while back with pip: a lot of third-party tools were importing internal functions and other code from pip, pip released a new version that rearranged the internals, and the third-party tools all immediately broke. Second, but less common, some distros have a history of doing weird-ish things with Python and Python tools. Some have been known to ship only parts of the Python standard library, or rename things, or do lots of other stuff to fit the way the distro wants the world to work. One example I remember vividly is that Django used to ship its base command-line management script as something named `django-admin.py`, but some distros had a policy of never allowing a command-line tool to be named with file extension, so when they packaged up Django they'd rename that script to just `django-admin`. And then someone would install Django from the distro package archives, try to do the online tutorial, and get "command not found" when the tutorial told them to run `django-admin.py` and report a "bug" in Django because their distro had silently renamed the script (it's now officially named `django-admin`, in part due to this).
Wow that’s awesome. I definitely have to check out the audio editing part. Any specific library?

There are some useful tools in it for linear algebra I haven't found elsewhere. Their linalg library has tools for solving linear systems, computing SVDs, etc. They also have great tools for optimization (I have definitely used the fsolve function and its counterparts for solving PDEs). I would suggest taking a look at a few parts you might be interested in. It would be a good module to add to your repertoire. 
Thanks for your help. I did however get aiohttp working, and it works well with asyncio by default, so I’d rather use that. Turns out ipv6 was the issue, AsyncResolver doesn’t like it. To quote from the solution posted on StackOverflow: “I had a similar issue when using AsyncResolver as the resolver for the connection. It used to be the default resolver so it might by your case. The problem was related to domains with ipv6 where the AsyncResolver has problems so the solution was to simply specify the family to ipv4 addresses conn = aiohttp.TCPConnector( family=socket.AF_INET, verify_ssl=False, ) “

Sounds like fun.
find a problem, write a soultion. sounds simple and understated but it is not. as you solve more problems you will figure out if you truly enjoy scripting things out. I wouldn't limit myself to python here, write bash, powershell, c, java. Find a problem, figure out a way to solve it with a script write it and learn something then do it again. I think most people have trouble coming up with problems, if that is the case you can use a book like automate the boring the stuff or learn python the hardway. But it sounds like you already did do some scripting so you most likely know the basics so it is unclear how much those will help.

Business / social science research. I use python for every phases of the research process from collecting the data through analysis and presentation. It is one of the few tools that seems to be a good fit for almost everything and there are great libraries and tools to lighten the load.

This all seems extremely convoluted. I want to have the fastest round-trip for "edit → save → run tests → read test results" as possible. I could write a small script that detects changes to the junit XML file, and then rerun this, and refresh the browser), but that's additional work, additional things that can break and throw me out of "the zone". Plus it adds precious seconds to the editing sequence I mentioned above. This might be nice if you run your tests only once or twice a day, but if you run them *continuously* on each save, nothing beats immediate feedback you get from the console. And it even works seamlessly on a remote machine as well. I find that a combination of `entr` and the pytest option `--lf` from `pycache` is simple and blazingly fast.
Working on some pretty major changes to u/pythonHelperBot. I am wrapping up praw submissions, comments, and user classes in my own custom classes. It should populate most of the needed values all at once, and wraps them in a try and except loop to catch internet connection issues, server errors and api rate limit errors. The classes should also make it much easier to archive posts for future classifier training as well as testing. Last week was a big week. I got a readme and faq on github, as well as the bots source code, and the source code for some personal libraries the bot uses. It's a pretty major personal milestone for the project. 
As a novice programmer, I don't understand what the difference is between this and PyQt5, where you use their designer GUI and then export the code to py files (or just start with py files to begin with). What is different from this older way? Thank you.
Qt has been around quite a lot longer than any web solution. It is extensively documented and even years ago I never ran into a problem that someone else hadn't run into. There is documentation specific to PySide2, and most of the PyQt documentation and support is very easily translated. But I generally find the Qt docs to be sufficient. Even PyQt has been around longer than jQuery.
I went through all of the examples you listed and I definitely have a preference for `click`. Specifically for the friendly option type checking. I didn't know `tqdm` that's a good one I'll use it 👍
Have you tried updating Virtual box?
I'm not sure what you mean. Python can get excellent performance for this sort of task. `aiohttp` definitely has *some* warts, but literally all the code I write is async and I think `aiohttp` is great. I'm not involved in the development at all, but I can usually debug any problems I have with `aiohttp`. The docs are excellent, it's pretty fast, and it has (in my opinion) a nice API. It is 100% a different paradigm and I wouldn't recommend it to everyone, but I've found it to be far, far easier and faster than `urllib3` with threads. This is just my opinion and normally I wouldn't state it as strongly, but I dislike it when folks present their opinions as cold, hard fact. 
If you have a program (program.py) with three functions (a(), b(), and c()), and want to move a() and b() to another file (support.py), you would create support.py... def a(): print("I am a().") def b(): print("I am b().") Then import what you want into program.py with... from support.py import a, b ...or even... from support.py import * Then remove a() and b() from program.py.
Taking a break for a couple of weeks from my current project -- a programming language implemented in Python with LLVM by way of the \`llvmlite\` library. [https://github.com/syegulalp/Akilang](https://github.com/syegulalp/Akilang) I'll be back to work on it in January, but you can always pull and try out the examples (sorry, Win32 only for now). I try to keep \`master\` in such a state that the examples and the tests should work at any given time.
I refuse to call it cute. Kew - T. Although I don't know any other developers personally so perhaps if I go to a cute conference I'll have to change my ways.
I came a long way with PDFQuery, when I had a simmilar problem. [https://github.com/jcushman/pdfquery](https://github.com/jcushman/pdfquery) &amp;#x200B; I does take som time to find out how the document is structured. You cannot be sure that thing are organised as you expect. Fx. I had to use lines in the document to find area of interest and then scrape within this area.
Looks like the do have QThreadPool- wonder if its fatster than the pyqt5 implementation. The way I've make multiprocessing work in my program is laughable garbage. 
So it looks like for the time being, Pyqt5 is the more mature project. 
Just the names? PDF body only, rather than in the metadata? Find a PDF to text converter, in Python, or callable via `subprocess.check_output` (e.g., `mutool convert`). Find a named entity recognizer (NER), that supports names. I think SpaCy might have one, possibly NLTK. Now if you mean usernames, you may be less in luck. IIRC, most NER out there are for proper names, not usernames. Could try?
Lots of people still use every test framework. Not to mention its always more expensive to switch what you use than to keep what you use.
Qt Designer is separate from PyQt, PyQt is just the bindings library. Essentially PyQt and PySide provide the same functioning, but PyQt5 has the advantage right now of being around/tested/supported longer while PySide has a less restrictive license. I use PyQt5, but am interested in trying this out.
I mean you can just run `pyinstaller --noconsole mainprogram.py` and it'll poop out libraries and an .exe in the `dist` folder and then use something like Inno Setup to create your program installer. 
Technically, any process. I probably can't say what processes are currently in the labs, sorry. I can say that if you look at my post history, it's pretty easy to figure out where I am and thus which company I'm at... the current transistor sizes are public information from there.
Files, named `.env`, usually in the root of your repository, containing shell-like syntax defining environment variables to be set automatically either when running code from the repo, or when entering the repo (e.g., `pipenv shell`, `set -a; . ./.env; set +a`—brittle viz quoting, `dotenv` directly, `docker-compose`, etc.).
So they're both essentially doing the same thing, being a binding library, except PySide has a different license agreement?
you have the OpenSource version with is under LGPLv3 (Some tools are GPLv2), and also there is a Qt commercial license.
For crypto you can try https://coinmarketcap.com
yes, that's correct. There is a couple of different in a couple of methods like (pyqtSlot, and Slot, or pyqtSignal and Signal), there are a couple of [missing bindings in PySide2](https://wiki.qt.io/Qt_for_Python_Missing_Bindings) that you can check out. PyQt5 is developed by Riverbank and you have OpenSource (GPLv2) and Commercial licence, and PySide2 is developed by The Qt Company and you have OpenSource (LGPLv3/GPL2) and Commercial license.
Excellent performance compared to what? To pigeon mail? I guess... &gt; all the code I write is async and I think aiohttp is great Your argument reads, literally: "I am a fanboy and proud, I don't need any proofs, I just want to believe!" &gt; but I dislike it when folks present their opinions as cold, hard fact. So... you probably should go stand in a corner contemplating your life goals? Idk. you are basically bashing yourself here... :/
Thanks for clarifying.
Conversely, why give yourself more work to do when there's a well-tested and well-maintained package that'll do the job for you? `click` doesn't fit your straw ~~man~~ package argument well--it doesn't have 'a few stars', it's got 6.8k, and it comes from the same stable as flask and werkzeug. I've used both in the past and `click` scales much more easily than `argparse`. As a result, even with smaller projects I tend to use `click` because it reduces the effort of having to remember two systems, and the documentation is excellent.
TIL. 
Oh, so much for ipv6 support :D Well, you know, a library that has desperately poorly reinvented an idea from the 90's cannot possibly foresee such novelty as ipv6, since it's been only around for some 20 years! That kind of reflects the screwed up state of infrastructure programming we are in today.
Which is the exact opposite of "going out of their way to sabotage certain environments".
If you're making a stand-alone desktop app, I could see PyQt being fine. There's not really much you gain from electron. If you need to integrate with a webapp or website, or you need fancy graphics, you'll run into issue with Qt and also find it hard to recruit good designers that know it.
If you include `click` library in your interface, you already secured a place in hell. Didn't read further.
Raising an exception based on the content of an environment variable isn't deliberate? 
Why?
Never. For almost every problem there is a proper optimized library to handle it. Generally, if it's taking too long to compute is because of some crappy algorithm of mine.
Haha yes!
Love it.
To say its not a problem is not true. I didn't even know this could be a problem, till the problem happened. If the below comment is read, you can quickly see that many distros are basically modifying the python package. This breaking thing doesn't happen everywhere. Maybe it happens in the distros world. But not wit hall software. Surely this is huge problem if thought in a long-term 10 thousands system scale.

Well this sucks. Any distro that do not do such shenanigans ? Centos ?
Of course. In mining modelling there is always the problem of big complex geometries. irregular surfaces, finite underground planes or surfaces, deep excavations, glaciers, etc. Geomechanics is a particular field of Mechanical Engineering, the same concepts of stress and deformation applies, and so forth the same kind of modelling is used. In order to create a geomechanical model, it's necessary to have an error-free mesh (division of whole geometry into smaller elements). This error-free mesh is particularly hard to create when the initial geometry is all messy (usually the case of mining geometries). My project handles this cases, simplifying geometries and creating this kind of models.
I'm about to release an open source (GPL3) application using PyQt5. Should I bother to port it to PySide?
The solution, as others have pointed out, is to use isolated environments (what Python calls a virtualenv). You can even do those using the system Python with the `venv` module in the standard library, but tools like pyenv and its virtualenv wrappers make it easy to use an alternate Python interpreter or version if you prefer.
Just to make the information more complete, the commercial licence is around [5500 USD per year per developer](https://www.qt.io/buy-product/). Wow, that's more expensive than I remember. Last time I checked (which was a few years ago), it was a flat 5000 USD per project, no renewals or subscriptions required. 
Just be aware that pyinstaller isn't perfect. I'm currently using it for my project and it puts around 500mb of libraries and such in the dist folder, however, I found that deleting most of those doesn't cause errors on my program. I also couldn't get pyinstaller to work with python 3.7, which I was eager to use. However, it does work and is relatively easy to use and configure, unlike other similar tools I tried.
I mostly did data extraction scraping netCDF files using a for loop that looped through 36. Years of annual files. I saved the data to a dataframe using pandas/numpy.
That is the standard price, there are special free/reduced licenses for startups, freelancers, and small businesses, etc IIRC
Thanks, good timing as i am building a terminal for my work team.
Check Derek Banas on YouTube, this guy is awesome (not just django, he has everything) 
Assuming you're using Python, I would start with librosa for the auditory analysis. A quick-and-dirty machine learning approach would just be to use that package to compute MFCCs and use them as input for a supervised classifier.
Well that's a question you need to answer yourself :) if you know the licenses differences, the state of the projects, how active are the communities and the companies behind them, you can use whatever fits your needs. 
Sometimes instead of looking for a button I just send Enter key. Not sure it's gonna help you, I've never had this issue.

Trying to come up with the right idea for a simulation game and getting bogged down by indecisiveness. I want the "idea" to be as abstract as possible so as to avoid something like creating variables akin to "fitness" or arbitrary values that are hardcoded in a way. Too many evolution simulation type games end up like that. So then that leads to the problem of complexity. If I want a more "natural" simulation type game, I need to create a realistic and complex environment for my agents to evolve in, which quickly leads to physics and other nuanced things I don't want to implement. So I'm gravitating towards a grid-based environment and am trying to think of other ways to make things nuanced instead, which is breaking my brain. This comment is way too abstract.
ELI5 the difference between this and pipenv
Finishing up a slackbot that'll pull available meeting rooms from company's google calendar
Just wondering, did they give up with pyside2
PySide2 is licensed under [LGPL3](https://tldrlegal.com/license/gnu-lesser-general-public-license-v3-%28lgpl-3%29), which allows commercial use, so no need to pay a license fee.
thank you both.
this is installed by default with python. Why grab pipenv if you already have something like that? That being said, pipenv is better at handling larger dependency chains, and is g[enerally regarded as a more powerful package manager.](https://linuxacademy.com/community/posts/show/topic/25502-pipenv-vs-venv). tl;dr pipenv is a package manager+virtual environment
My experience with PyQt, PySide, and now Qt for Python has given me the exact opposite impression. &gt; If you need to integrate with a webapp or website, or you need fancy graphics, you'll run into issue with Qt and also find it hard to recruit good designers that know it welll enough (it's subtly different from browser) &gt;For example: If you have a website that displays some page, and you want to display that page from inside your app, you'll find the Qt webview quite limiting in what it supports. You can - Navigate - Read source, cookies, etc - Intercept and modify requests - Inject Javascript - Resize And so much more. Can you expand on what you find limiting there? &gt;Another example, your client is an action movie and wants an app that has fancy FX of almnost game-like quality. Don't even try that with Qt. Qt supports DirectX, OpenGL, and now Vulcan. Also not sure what you would find limiting here if you could expand?
LGPL3 allows commercial use, so I don't think the commercial license is required..?

This is pyside2. You install it with `pip install pyside2`.
Remember, a virtual environment a day keeps the [xkcd superfund site](https://xkcd.com/1987/) away. 
You just made my day...I was sorely missing my `jk` mapping for `&lt;esc&gt;`
Yep this. Except lock files. Pipenv sucks absolute donkey dick when it comes to lock files.

What you need is to use a virtual environment to keep the build clean of extra dependencies. I present to you, [Virtual Environments: Extreme Advertising Edition!](https://i.redd.it/f60emy6qq2521.jpg)
I'm a Python contractor and had some slack time. About 5 weeks ago I was talking with a guy from a company that ships boxes. The guy finds out what I do and explains that their process is horrible, uses paper dockets and has reached the point where he's spending all his time fielding requests for tracking information from customers. This is clearly the bottleneck to their growth and he know it. They currently use a templating, shared hosting solution. He knew he needed a database and that their shared hosting solution was a flat site. All the business process was html form to email and handled in a spreadsheet from there. He wants users to print their own labels and be able to track their own parcels. So I start wondering if there's a qr maker/scanner that runs off a phone and has a permissive license. Yay, there's a choice! So my next choice is Django, Flask or something special? Well they aren't going to be the size of DHL overnight so I went with Django for a 'batteries included' framework, even if it's not the most efficient. Created a few models around the objects identified as part of MVP and aimed at getting a demo together. When it came to django apps, I decided that django-countries was going to be useful, while django-cities added too much complexity for a first iteration, especially since initially we were talking about them self-hosting. The customer was happy without automatic postcode and address validation at this point. Django-registration is my goto for registration. It isn't to be for the general public at this stage, only staff. For the frontend I went for jquery and bootstrap. I'd used both before but I'm no front-end guy and I curse when I write javascript. In fact while I was initially developing the backend I just used a little jquery and brute force css and script tags to poke the back end. Registration features emerged around week 2 since fine-grained permissions were going to be needed. A user profile class with permissions and related locations helped filter items for different roles. Once some semblance of structure established itself I refactored the back end into separate apps and renamed a bunch of badly named variables throughout. I think it helps to have pushes of a day or few to get some aspect of the project up to scratch. Simple &gt; complex &gt; complicated. The next week saw a re-work of the frontend so had me going into the templates to get the bootstrap containers right, throwing away a few pages of crummy css in favour of a few specific lines that give a consistent look. Meanwhile, the back-end is being fleshed out and forms are declaring classes on field widgets and modelformset\_factories are flying in and out of requests and responses. Somewhere along the line I've written a few template tags, fixtures, yet still no tests! The back office system has been evolving and is becoming rather usable. When the permissions were working I made the nav dynamically respond to that (with the same permissions on the actual views, obviously!). A docs page for staff helped me make sure I hadn't missed anything with my thinking about the system. A glossary of terms plus role-specific docs and an explaination of the permission system. The models of the MVP have stabilised so I'm now working out from there to polish the forms, views, unfinished features etc. The demo after the first week showed them a qr code generated and scanned. Another demo showed the state of stored items changing when the scanner was used. The last demo had started to flesh out the UI but then I put up a test instance for them to play with (hint: hosting the test instance with a valid ssl cert will save you a week of explanation to and undue worry on the part of the client). They also have collaborative access to the github issue tracker which is now tracking a few dozen issues I've created, most with labels and milestones. There's still a way to go but training and bringing the user along is so important. There's no point in announcing something to be complete without the user being ready and able to start using it. Some things you think might take 5 minutes to explain can take much longer. Users will say they understand but they also don't want to appear stupid so they lie. Training is a field in itself. I'm fortunate to have a client here that really wants the system and has a technical guy he trusts that set the current site up to explain some things, handle certificates etc. It's hard for a small outfit to do this; it would be prohibitively expensive and risky. If a large firm threw resources at this there would be a dozen people involved and then mythical man month math applies. The scale it would start from would require excellent performance from the start, and other higher MVP requirements. I've taken on that risk since I don't get paid until production is running (hopefully early in the new year) and I was genuinely interesting in solving the problem (bored). It gave me a chance to use the Python3/Django2/Jquery\[-1:\]/Bootstrap4 stack in anger, honing my skills. The MVP launch milestone will be followed by two weeks of bugsquashing and rapid response devops, tightly coupled to encouraging the client to raise bugs. After that there's a few features already destined for iteration 1, including tests!
Unless you want to poke around in Qt’s code, yes.
What do you think of Conda envs? Awesome post.
Okay but I thought the docs were different
I don't even know where to start, like I can't find any easy guides where it's like "here's how".
Oof, too pricey for my budget.
Or just dont use a package for every task, write some stuff on your own and only use the packages you really need while working on few projects and not on everything at the same time And you end up with a list you can easily clean or scrap everything and reload the few you really need.
Or just use a virtual environment, so everything is nicely bundled in its own folder, and your OS and python gets to be blissfully unaware. Even if you write your own stuff, it helps to have isolated containers for unrelated projects. Keeps things nice and clean during building and packaging. 
You're the creator of fman, right? It's a great project!!
I just posted it in here earlier, but I just published a deep dive into Python and Django logging. Logging was super confusing for me when I first started out, so I basically tried to rewrite the docs in an intuitive manner. It was a lot more work than I expected, but also a lot more interesting. [https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/a7cvmt/deep\_dive\_python\_and\_django\_logging\_in\_plain/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/a7cvmt/deep_dive_python_and_django_logging_in_plain/)
If you have ever used matlab, numpy is the basic matrix syntax support, and scipy is all the toolboxes.
the reason not to use it is that you have do more stuff besides coding, the thing you actually want to do.
You still have to run bin/activate these days?
its two commands to set up, then only one command to use. if typing `bin/activate` is too hard for you, you have other problems. 
How else should it work? People have different projects, and also people have different shells. running `activate` auto chooses the proper config for the following: csh, powershell, fish shell, and bash.
I'm still stuck with virtualenv but considering switching to conda. Been seeing some posts saying it's a better replacement but if also would like to know others' thoughts 
Try /r/learnpython 
Well I personally believe Conda is much better, as it can install tons of additional and system dependencies but I would like to hear OP's opinion on the matter.
But will my env be deactivated on reboot? Will I have to run bin/activate every time I want to use it?
Personally, I use direnv to automatically activate and deactivate my virtualenvs
I went through it a long time ago and also fairly recently as a refresher. I think it's a decent starting point, though the quality is kind of up and down. Some parts have too many examples and extraneous details, while others don't receive as much in-depth coverage as they deserve - especially classes, objects, and generators IIRC.
yeah, because I'm totally going to roll my own API library to talk to AWS instead of using boto3... /s
It will be deactivated as soon as you close out of whatever shell you're using. &gt;Will I have to run bin/activate every time I want to use it yes, however pycharm and vscode both include ways to handle this for you so you don't have to think about it. 
I feel in love with pipenv recently. Way better than Conda IMO. Especially when combined with fishshell. You simply CD into the folder and the virtual environment for that project is fired up. Better, you can setup the prompt to tell you which venv is active - so you never end up polluting one project with another by accident. 
Someone gild this 
I'm like that with SQL
I love virtualenv and I use it almost everywhere. The thing is, I'm currently sporting a portable version of windows python on a flash drive. I thought it was a good idea so I could develop anywhere (and it actually works), but it makes everything a bit harder. I dunno, I'm probably a masochist. Anyway, I tried setting a virtual env in this flash environment once, and everything broke horribly, so I left it alone. But if you're saying that might solve that huge tracts of garbage pyinstaller is grabbing, I think it might try it again.
Curiously, that's about the size I get after deleting all the garbage (I made a script to delete the files I identified as unnecessary after building the executable with pyinstaller).
I like npm install.
Just looked at a bunch of my envs. 60-120MB. x 100 = 6-12 GB. I've seen 120 Gb SSDs for $50. So it is $5 worth of storage. Nothing.
hi. Please provide more details about what happens/differs between versions. Some example of different outputs maybe? You can also try to recreate problem with only one particular input , wo using comprehension/loop. And sorry I couldn't give exact answer.
Kind of starting... To learn python 😵
Lol - ok. Just change my work habits and stop using dependencies. Yeah, that sounds much easier.
that's not a virtual environment though. `npm install` is the same thing as doing `pip install`. 
With virtualenv, do you end up reinstalling the packages for every environment? E.g., do you end up with a copy of Pandas in every environment or does it symlink?
As a developer, I'm very happy with PyQt5 right now. I think the community size doesn't make much difference, since I almost always check the C++ documentation anyway (I'm always impressed that the python interface/bindings are so close that I barely have any trouble "translating" it to python code). My only real problem is the licensing, as in, I know very little about licences and the licensing schemes of both Qt and PyQt. I'll probably have to study it anyway, but I plan to release my software as GPL, and I've read that both companies allows free usage of their libraries for GPL-compliant software, so I'm hoping I won't have too much trouble there...
Except you have to run bin/activate before you start your project, right?
Do you still have to run pip freeze &gt; requirements.txt to update your package list?
No problem ^.^
not for `pip install`. only for virtual environments. think of a virtual environment as a contained box that includes any customized files and dependencies for a project. you delete the folder, you delete all your project files and python dependencies. npm doesn't have nice dependency separation between projects to my knowledge. but then I don't actively use npm. 
Does it work with pyenv? Even with `pyenv shell &lt;version&gt;`
I think making sure that drive always mounts as the same letter ( like F:\) might improve things. But at that point, why not buy a cheap used thinkpad and throw windows on it. 
Make a video version. Get the flext tape guy to do it.
yes. 
Same - just delete the node_modules folder inside your project and you get rid of all your dependencies. Dependency separation for different projects in npm? Just place a single package.json and make sure your projects exist in separate folders. Projects may also be parent -&gt; child to one another and their dependencies will still be separate. 
Yeah that annoyed me too compared to how npm handles dependency tracking
A [plugin exists to do that](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-virtualenv). 
Oook... be quiet please 😄
Each environment will need to `pip install` packages needed for it. There is no symlinking. 
r/justlearnedthefword
I didn't know about tqdm. Thank you.
Is there a good reason to prefer virtualenv if you can use docker instead?
You can have a look at/use my [zshrc for python](https://github.com/AndydeCleyre/dotfiles/blob/master/.python.zshrc), and add another `envin` function for anaconda. It just wraps `pip-tools` and `venv` in convenience. Please let me know if it seems it can't very simply accomplish what you need.
It's an old meme sir, [but it checks out](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/extreme-advertising). 
Messing around with pygame. I'm a physics undergrad and I have been taught basic programming for data analysis, numerical integration, very basic simulations. Feeling pretty insecure about my programming knowledge. Never really programmed before and didn't even know what a list or dictionary was until recently (spoiled by numpy). I mainly want to create simulations for fun and needed to upgrade from matplotlib animate (lol). Really not sure if pygame is the best option here but I don't have experience with any other languages,apart from a C++ class I took once. If anyone has any better suggestions for this sort of thing let me know. 
Based on my experience, the message should really say 'Your cat wants to make you open the door', actually coming in is still a coin toss. Also I've been looking for some example code of exactly this kind of thing to play with, ta. 
Conda is great for installing dependencies that require other system libraries. Great for scientific computing sort of stuff that deals with assorted file types.
A+
Great job! I wonder if I can train this on skinwalkers so I know when NOT to open the door 🤔.
On linux I just make an alias function "activate &lt;name of venv&gt;" that looks at my venv folder for a folder with the name &lt;name of venv&gt;, and gets the bin/activate from there.
Haha too real! My cat is definitely guilty of this. http://e.lvme.me/1ug35y9.jpg

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_attribution_error Yeah I don't think they're trying to fuck on specific locales. They just don't wanna take the time to implement the library for other locales. Why don't you branch off of the project if your need support for multiple locales? I'd love to help as well! The Unicode hell from Python 2 to Python 3 is a arduous journey that no one should take alone!
More things like this goddamn it.
Pipenv is the way to go if you want to do anything more advanced and need good package handling 
I used pyenv back in the day - it would automatically bin/activate if you just cd into a project folder (this behavior is configurable)
You still need to develop the application you're running in docker first, and will likely want to try it outside of the docker container. Virtenv helps keep things clean. 
[Overcontainerization in python.](https://imgur.com/Xfknlc6) Sometimes people just create a docker image with a virtualenv inside for the shits and giggles. 
But...the Anaconda prompt also tells you which environment is active? But CDing into a directory and having an environment boot up would've nice -- currently I have to manually switch the path to Python when I switch environments. Suboptimal. Any experience with userfriendliness of pipenv/fishshell on Windows?
What's annoying is when I have multiple python version on a machine (outside of virtualenv), which means I have to use this command to create a Virtualenv: virtualenv -p python3 envname virtualenv -p python2.7 envname
Wait, but conda also has environment handling and package management. So why should I switch to pipenv? (Not being snarky, legit curious.)
People install fish on windows? 
Thanks! Turns out I just had to add the lldb stuff to my PYTHONPATH. All good now!
Dunno. That's why I'm asking. Backstory: I'm on Windows so I can be the oh-god-Windows-sucks beta tester instead of our less-experienced clients.
Everyone redditing at work is a professional using Python, is that your point?
The official documentation should be replaced with this. Far easier to understand! Pycharn ushered me into virtual environments and can't go back now.
Removing that check does not make anything suddenly go boom, so it's totally uncalled for. I, as a developer, know what can and can't be accepted in the particular environment I'm deploying to. That is not something a library developer should spend time dictating. 
There was an article posted here but as far as I know pipenv is good for specific use cases where you want to lock the package and Python versions in place without changing them; if your program is okay with being forward compatible then it’s not ideal.
Almost spit out my coffee on this one
Alright, officer.
They pretty much built a business deploying SciPy to windows.
I'm just starting to read 2 Scoops of Django and I quite like the idea of their approach (which isn't Django specific btw). Instead of having your venv folder inside your project folder cluttering it up (especially if it's a Django project), create a seperate folder somewhere just to store your venvs. Also means you won't accidentally check your venv into source control.
`nosetests` is not an unittest framework, it is just convenient way to load and run python builtin `unittest` cases, which isn't bad at all. So if you don't use the all glorified dependency injection (aka fixture) it is good enough.
Can you teach it to leave logging calls? The nice thing about %-formatting logs are that the string formatting is deferred until the actual log is written, so if a paticular log level doesn't generate output, there's no overhead to speak of.
Great shit, I will forward this to my department
Very cool! Just got a new pupper, so I want to make this. 
they both compete with eachother. conda is better geared for Anaconda. Just use what you know. Conda has a lot of overlap with the goals of pipenv, but it serves a different set of needs - in particular, the distribution of binaries. If the problem you’re trying solve is “how do I create reproducible environments, quickly, that include complex dependencies that are not written in pure Python”, conda is the tool of choice. If your problem is “How do I create and manage isolated environments for Python projects”, pipenv is the tool of choice.
I fucking love this.
Just find whatever conda env you like and make a requirements.txt file. then use that file in your virtualenv. bammo. that's what we do
I know there are other tools to do this but I wrote a little shell script that I symlink in to my project directories as a file named `activate` and then I run `src activate` (aliased source to src for fewer keystrokes) so I don't have to do `source /path/to/bin/activate`. You can pass it an argument for the name of the virtualenv if your project directory has a different name than the virtualenv directory. #!/bin/sh venvpath="$HOME/.virtualenvs/" project=`basename $(pwd)` activate="/bin/activate" if [ -n "$1" ] then source $venvpath$1$activate else source $venvpath$project$activate fi 
How so? Curious I started using it recently but have not noticed an issue here. My usecase isn't huge though
Okay, this is a cool distinction. I'll have to read up on pipenv and see if it's more suitable for what I'm doing at work. Thanks for the info!
no and never had to. just run the interpreter in the virtualenv directory directly: $ python -m venv test $ ./test/bin/pip install django # installs django in "test" venv $ ./test/bin/python # runs python shell in "test" venv
 Cool idea but why not make a pet door bell? You have all the code you need just about so that is easy. In any event the audible feedback will help thepet understand what is going on. It should make training a little easier. To put it another way let’s already know what’s ringing door bell means. If you give them a way to ring a bell 90% of the training is done. 
You are going to make me cry!
 brew install pipenv touch Pipfile pipenv install pipenv shell pip install mylibrary etc.. This has been my flow for Dockerfiles. Anyone see issues with this. 
I'm usually not a fan of extreme advertising, but I'll make an exception for this.
Why would you even bother dealing with Docker if you can just use virtualenv? Personally I think virtualenv is much much simpler to use than Docker, and it helps you keep track of what packages you install, making it easier to do a Docker image later, if you need it. Docker is great and all, but only for few specific problems. It's not the answer to most questions, even if my co-workers would disagree.
&gt;I think making sure that drive always mounts as the same letter ( like F:) might improve things. I already do this, it always mounts to X: What causes most problems is that most programs automatically find python on your system's path, and if they don't, you've gotta hope you can manually point to the python interpreter and the core package directories, which is usually messy. As I said, I got most of it functioning (except virtual env), but it wasn't a walk in the park. &gt;But at that point, why not buy a cheap used thinkpad and throw windows on it. This is my current plan. But I'm from Brazil, buying used here is a bit risky, I don't want to test my luck. And buying new is quite expensive - technology products here have a huge markup, and usually have significantly worse specs than similar models in the USA. My current plan is waiting for someone I know to go to the USA, buy a $600-ish thin-and-light laptop and bring it for me. Meanwhile, I have to make do with the flash drive or a raspberry pi while I'm not at home.
Thanks for the feedback. If you mean like: logger.info("log this: %s", "some parameters") then this should be ignored because I explicitly look for the `%` BinOp. Is it converting them for you? 
I have a strong distaste for anaconda. I have set up python on other peoples computers if they have had anaconda downloaded in the past it was a massive headache (maybe due to my inexperience). Some pip packages were not able to be found even when discoverable through pip3 list or figuring out how to change you bash.rc back to normal. As well people who always use anaconda may not develop the same unix skills. My recommendation is use pyenv with virtualenv and pyenv-virtualenv (the github tutorial is great and easy)
C dependencies.
I'm a fan of conda. It does all three: pip, virtual environments, and manage python versions. The table at the bottom of this link summarizes all the pip, pyenv, etc. options. [https://www.andrey-melentyev.com/python-environments-and-where-to-find-them.html](https://www.andrey-melentyev.com/python-environments-and-where-to-find-them.html)
I have indeed reviewed it! For someone who already knows a different programming language already, or is already somewhat familiar with Python, it is a tutorial of fairly good quality. However, for someone who has never done any programming in their life, I find it to be completely unsuitable as a day-1 learning resource. With great regularity, it makes statements that are absolutely baffling or meaningless to a complete non-programmer. Take the very first paragraph of the tutorial as an example: &gt; Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming. Python’s elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms. I assure you, that paragraph might as well be written in Martian hieroglyphics in terms of understanding to someone who has zero coding experience. And these kinds of things are EVERYWHERE. The tutorial was simply not written taking non-programmers into account.
No, I was asking because it appears that I have misunderstood the description. I haven't actually tried the code yet.
Programming in Java is my 'day job'. And maven is 'heaven' compared to python's mess. No maven isn't perfect (got a few horror stories too for sure). Just google on how to install pip... and you'll get the idea. If you can't install it easily, its kind of hard to use. It took me quite a while to setup virtual envs, or to begin with, figure out that's the 'best' solution for me. There seem to any number of different ways to get started with a 'sane' dependency environment. Trouble is, just there, that kind of confusion is a problem. It means you can't just simply 'jump in' and start coding up whatever it is you wanted to try. Instead you spend a day or two figuring out how to install some libraries you'd need to use.
Yes, you have to check the Anaconda channels and sometimes packages are only available on pip (although they must not be standard because most of the usual dependencies are there). However it is still possible to put everything under a env.yml and have Conda automatically call pip to install it. Concerning UNIX skills, what do you mean? Conda can be controlled by the command line (I believe it's much better that way!).
I wrote \[ave\]([https://github.com/selectnull/ave](https://github.com/selectnull/ave)) just for that, it's flexible with where you keep you virtual environments and is pip installable.
Right, you're in the clear releasing GPL software. If you plan on making something proprietary and selling it, pyside2 will be friendlier for that license-wise. 
Maybe at one point in time. However, Qt offically adopted Pyside2.
OK thanks
Oh, I see, thanks!
So desktop gui app, thanks
Now use Visual Studio code and hate yourself as it completely shits the bed.
Pipenv manages virtual environments plus some extra tools to remember the packages installed into that environment. It is designed to make the exact set of dependencies used in a virtual environment easy to share, so that everyone in a team (and also, for example, deployment servers etc) can get the same virtual environment installed automatically. See also: [requirements.txt](https://pip.readthedocs.io/en/1.1/requirements.html) or [poetry](https://github.com/sdispater/poetry) 
Yes. I haven't touched it in a while, but I had windows setup with ubuntu and was effectively casting/serving a command prompt that had a more linux look and feel to it. I think I was using VcXsrv, but I really can't recall for certain. 
Do you also pronounce it See-Quay-Lee?
Not on debian, because they don't package it with python itself :(
Yell at the python package maintainers?
Interesting. &gt; might as well be written in Martian hieroglyphics This was me a few years ago. I did not do CS, and am self taught, and 'needed' tutorials. Now, when I read the paragraph you refer to, when I am not certain on what something means, I would stop mid sentence, and go and look up what it means (eg, high-level, dynamic typing, etc). So, I am by no means an expert, but feel comfortable reading this, and before I go off handing advice to those I know (were they to want coding advice) I don't want to sound like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mJ_Qftw2_0) guy.... although at the same time, if I had attempted to decipher the hieroglyphics, it would have been more difficult initially, but faster in the long run, possibly. &amp;#x200B;
I do it. What if you want to run multiple containers within one image? 
that sounds a lot like a homework assignment ;) Point her to a good on-line python resource where she can find out for herself... It's the greatest gift you can give her ;)
I am. Thanks! :-)
You are right. Writing a outward post needs domain specific knowledge. Maybe I can write on one or two domains, but not all. Maybe I will try this during this Christmas.
What was your process for training the model? I’m imagining you just manually labeled a few videos and did frame by frame training to detect the cat.
&gt;Conda why would you use an virtual/pip/whateaver env in docker? just install python :)
People love reaching for chainsaws when they need a pocketknife.
Id say it is as well but shes been out of college for a bit...its something with her cyber security crap. shes 30 so no sure who assigns homework at 30. she has the resources also...this is laziness which i have as well. Same reason I took the information systems route instead of the comp sci route.
I think you used this in the wrong scope.
`virtualenvwrapper`. I activate my venvs with `workon`.
I can't watch that video at the moment, but I think I know what you mean! I would still *strongly* advise against recommending the official tutorial as the very first, primary resource for a completely brand new programmer with zero experience. I have a lot of experience with this demographic. They will not, and probably cannot, up any of those words. What they will do is assume those are words that they should already know if they want to learn Python, get frustrated, declare programming to be "too hard" or "confusing", and often completely give up. Which would be a bummer!
Because there will be a big fraction of your users, who will quite literally send you to hell, in these very words. Other than that, the basic premise of the library, from programmer's perspective is trash. The library doesn't provide any means of reusing or structuring your code. It kind of forces you into write-only mode. So, IDK. Beside the personality standing behind the library, there's nothing worth of note about it. Especially in the light of `ArgumentParser`, which is kind of OK most things you will need it, and actually works.
Are you relying on the dict being ordered, because that's not a guarantee in all versions of Python, an implementation-specific detail in Python 3.6, and a language spec in 3.7. Anything prior to that, relying on order can have unpredictable results.
I do Embedded Software and we're using Python for home security. We've also experimented with MicroPython on the ESP32-class devices.
&gt; \* (NOTICE: SOME USERS MAY EXPERIENCE LOCK FILES THAT BECOME A PAIN IN THEIR ASS) Wait whats the problem with lock files? Pipenv has its problems, and I'll be the first in line to call them out along with it's author for his BS, but I've never had a problem with the lock files.
"let me in! I need to go out again."
The "Qt for Python" is just a re-branding to include more stuff beside the PySide2 module
I use the magic combination of * pyenv * pyenv-venv * pyenv-virtualenvwrapper * poetry
True, but of course under a certain set of conditions: [https://tldrlegal.com/license/gnu-lesser-general-public-license-v3-(lgpl-3)](https://tldrlegal.com/license/gnu-lesser-general-public-license-v3-(lgpl-3))
What if you have two different python scripts with completely different dependencies running on the same docker image? Same usecase as without using docker...
My bad, I do mean the plugin, but should be more clear about it. Thanks for the clarification.
As a code newbie I’m glad I learned about venv’s just in time to appreciate this.
I actually used the pre-trained MobileNet-SSDLite model from the [TensorFlow detection model zoo](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/detection_model_zoo.md). By default, it can detect 80 or so objects, including cats and dogs. However, it isn't very accurate!
To the top! :)
If you're trying to avoid a web GUI, you have only limited formatting available in widgets such as QTextBrowser. You could use Qt's embedded browser to get more effects, but then you have the web GUI you didn't want (and I've seen websites it doesn't work on despite the fact that it's supposed to be Chromium) You could build a custom UI framework out of the Qt widgets, but how long is that going to take you, and where do you find a designer? Most them know web-tech or adobe flash/air, or a game engine UI. V-Play is probably the best Qt-based solution I've seen for this. Gives you nice graphics on top of Qt, quickly, and it's reasonably easy on your designer. For second point, you often need to combine several rendering engines, for example your physics engine is displaying a model, and top of that you want a nice GUI. Something like Gameface has much better integration for this than Qt which doesn't really understand how to combine the web view with another renderer in a performant manner.
I am working on an internal project for work. Its basically just middleware that stitches one API to several others (raw media content --&gt; various content distribution channels) but depending on the object the operations can get pretty complex(if content is of type x and going to \[y,z\] but not a, do b to it before it leaves) . My personal goal for this project is to try to keep things as modular as possible so when new content types are added with new specifications I don't have to go climbing in to the bowels of the program. Wish me luck! &amp;#x200B; Oh.. one neat thing I guess about this project is the use of dictionaries as case statements. I'm sure most of you know this, but you can emulate case statements in Python just by using a dict and making the value in the k,v pair the function you want executed. I'm sure there are better ways but this seems to be doing the trick for me.
In my case, in some projects with quite a lot of dependencies the locking process can take &gt;2 hours

Would you care to share that dependency tree? That sounds totally out of whack. 
You can also put `venv/bin` in your `$PATH`.
Just use pipenv init
That link doesn't seem to work.

Sorry for the joob question but do you need to activate the environment every time you want to run a program?
If you need to run different versions of Python (e.g. Python 2.7 and Python 3.7l on same machine, Conda is a better choice, even so if you are on Mac Otherwise vitualenv is simpler
It's good to know how to use both because not everything like conda (older brew installs I'm looking at you)
If it's conda installable, use the conda version. If it's not, use the pip version. For the 99.99% user, this will resolve all of your problems. For the rest, congrats you are doing something both hard and arcane.
Maybe it's because I don't write code for others, I've been happy with just using python -m venv &lt;env_name&gt;. I've tried pipenv, still don't get why I would use or need it. conda also suffers from long piplock process. With .whl format being more widely used, I have less of a need to use conda on Windows anymore.
Lol yup. Forgot to specify _this_ 
So now your environment and code are married inextricably.
This is amazing! Laughed my fucking ass off, well done. On a more serious note I run miniconda for python and use miniconda envs for development all day every day to not muck up my prod deployments.
You are wildly underestimating the utility of docker.
Real talk though, is there any way to understand/fix what's going on in this comic? I definitely have this happening on my Mac 
Start removing pip packages and clean up. 
Pipenv is better if you need to nail down specific package versions and python versions. 
For solo Dev, there's not much of a reason especially if you've got no GUI requirement or have x forwarding working. Especially with compose, just mount the code into the container and roll from there. But docker isn't available everywhere, singularity is great but can be bulkier to move around than an environment file (ie in a hpc environment).
You activate it for your current shell, then it goes away if you deactivate it or close your shell/terminal window. 
You put brew in docker?
Solo use, probably no need, but if I wasn't building s jupyter hub for people, I'd have a 2.7/3.5/latest probably. But I'd use conda so jupyter can swap between them per notebook.
Dump ones you aren't using to env files and dispose of them.
Or want to be able to replicate the interior of the docker container elsewhere.

Docker philosophy is to isolate them into two different containers, isn't it? 
Not really. If I want to make a new environment for it I can. Or if I want to open it in another, existing venv I can... Or, if I simply don't want to be in the environment while in that folder, I can.. this just takes care of the typical use case for me. e.g. activating the environment when I intend on working with that project. no having the manually change env vars or run commands every time I change projects - only when doing something special. If anything, I feel it's even less married to the environment than typical venv. Because the bin/activate stuff is placed elsewhere. Not in the project folder. Instead, pipenv autogenerates/manages a project file for you, so that the environment can be replicated with a simple install command... (similar to npm)
&gt; and javascript Actually, I've moved on from JavaScript a long time ago. It is a terrible language. TypeScript now that... I realy like. And with npm dependency management that whole part of the programming experience isn't too bad neither. So if I am to write any code for the whole 'nodejs' ecosystem nowadays, typescript would be what I choose to write in. Not pure JS, I am not a massochist :-)
Ah so you are basically checking the folder for a file somewhere and it's firing off an activate command for you. I'd bet you could do similar with conda. I'd read that initially as the environment lives in the folder not that it struts the folder so there's some sort of history tying it together automatically. 
IS YOUR SHITTY bin/activate SHIT SCRIPT NOT WORKING WHEN YOU RUN IT? THAT'S BECAUSE YOU NEED TO _SOURCE_ IT DO THIS: source &lt;myenv&gt;/bin/activate WHY DO YOU NEED TO SOURCE SOMETHING THAT LIVES IN THE BIN DIRECTORY? BECAUSE FUCK YOU. DID SOURCING IT THROW YOU A WEIRD ERROR? YOU'RE PROBABLY USING AN UNSUPPORTED SHELL. FUCKING SHITSTACK VIRTUALENV THINKS IT SHOULD DIRECTLY TOUCH YOUR ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES USING SHELL-SPECIFIC COMMANDS SO GO EDIT YOUR ACTIVATE SCRIPT AND IMPLEMENT THE EXACT SAME FUNCTIONALITY THAT'S ALREADY IN THERE IN YOUR SHELL'S SYNTAX THAT'S IT. THANKS VIRTUALENV NOW KILL YOUR SHELL BECAUSE YOU ALREADY SOURCED THAT SCRIPT AND YOU NEED TO REFRESH IT RE-OPEN IT. WAIT YOU WANT TO USE SCREEN OR TMUX? LISTEN FUCK YOU Why can't everyone just accept the wonderful virtualenv into their life in the pristine and immutably perfect form it was created by God?
Not necessarily. If your program is installed with a `console_script` entrypoint, calling that directly is enough. You can also use the direct path to the python interpreter in the env.
I personally just hate the design decision to do every single thing through giant chains of function decorators.
Ah, nice. I don't read enough man/help pages.
Omg yes, just remember to always pass the --skip-lock argument...
Pipfile.lock sometimes takes a really long time to be generated, for no good reason, but its a known bug. No way around it really. So when you're installing something, the [locking pipfile] prompt will spin for infinite time until it finally (sometimes) locks

Why would you bother with virtualenv if you can just use Docker? Docker solves that problem and more, allows you to deploy and have dev/prod parity. A little bit steeper learning curve but if I’m honest I’ve been a dev for 15 years and one of the best learning investments I’ve made in my career, hands down, has been Docker. 
What's wrong with subparsers? *Caveat* My background is C programming, so my Pythonicness meter is probably not calibrated correctly.
Yes, exactly. But I didn't set that up. It just came with the pipenv install. I was already using fish, and when I decided to check out pipenv I didn't really have to do anything special to get these added features. (Though, I seem to recall installing a special version of pipenv, specifically for fish. ) All in all my console showed me git info, cwd, input timestampa, and autoconfigured venv and npm environments based on cwd. It was pretty sweet. Maybe I didn't mess with conda enough. But I didn't really find any of that sort of stuff. Anaconda felt more like an environment for environments, and those environments were better tailored to housing several projects in one. It also tried to be a package manager, but I found the available libs to be a bit less than what I needed, and working around missing libs/versions was a bit tedious. I didn't have those problems with pipenv - another reason I prefered it. 
I don't get it
It's fine if you're okay with running conda-only packages on a small list of platforms
&gt; All ~~programming~~ package managers ever are a dumpster fire FTFY. The smart question to ask is: In which way do this package manager suck, and can I use that to my advantage?
make this meme relevant again ?
It could be related to Python 2 leaking the comprehension loop variable to the local scope, which was fixed in Python 3.
Well you've set that up 'somewhere' either yourself or as part of an install script. Something is running in she'll to actively check for an environment tag when you CD into a directory and issuing the activate quietly in the background.

IDK i just assumed running another image just for a simple script would be a waste of cpu at scale? Is that wrong 
setup.py of things you pip install will still run as your user with all the normal filesystem permissions as your user. Only modules which do sane and normal setuptools type stuff will be safe to install with reckless abandon. Things which are actively bad can still wreck shop on your machine and will not be magically contained by the virtualenv.
Why? How is that a cost? You're gaining: agnosticism to shell syntax, no need to deactivate, non-messing with your PS1 prompt (which is intended to be set in an .rc file), and most importantly, no janky "remember how the environment was and reset it to that when you're done" model, which is fragile and susceptible to breakage. Ever activated a virtualenv and then activated a conda environment on top of it by accident? Shit's weird.
Lol, I don't know what half of this means.
You assume that I need to run 117 different shells. I don't. I use bash, and are happy with that. Also, I like to have my shell history intact when entering an environment. The cognitive load of deactivate is in practice less than the cognotove load of remembering how manye layers of shells are behind the present one. And for those two times a year where it should matter, a discardable shell is but a `C-a c` away.
It doesn't :( it's limited by the fact that it can only detect cats, dogs, and some other common animals (sheep, cows). But there's nothing stopping it from going off if the neighbor's cat is standing at your door!
Right, this isn't any sort of secure container. That's why I avoided any mentions of the word 'secure' 
But I like my swamp pips
700 upvotes tells me *yes*
Don't worry about it till you start using `pip` :) 
If I'm reading that correctly, you can sell something you make under lgpl3 but you still have to open source it?
That's great that you can use bash, but what about the people that don't? It's a question of not imposing unnecessary coupling for what is, at this point, a widely used tool. Fair point about history I guess. I don't really see why you'd be more than one layer deep. Also to be fair, I think the whole system is kind of dumpster-fire-ish, so picking on bin/activate is a fairly petty gripe in the scheme of things. 
Oof, they're hard when you first start out. My first "real" array challenge was working with [numpy-stl](https://github.com/WoLpH/numpy-stl) and the only thing that got me through it was thinking small. So start with a 2x2 array, if whatever you're trying to do to it works on that, it'll work on an NxN array (assuming the data is valid). Good luck!
you're welcome. It sounds like you want to use a UML tool and create class hierarchies. PyCharm commercial edition does it. In the world of free software, I showed the people with [the Reahl project](https://www.reahl.org) what I did in [this issue](https://github.com/reahl/reahl/issues/140) and they responded with how they do things. 
Trying to find something to work on
I honestly dont like click, so i tried to use the method that the argparse docs suggest to map subparsers to callables, but in order to get anything remotely close to: ``` foo --global-setting bar action1 foo action2 --flag --option1 foo action3 nested-command1 --flag ...etc ``` it was just getting more and more bafflingly complex. Whereas this is really straightforward with click. I think I'd tend to prefer something like the way `hug` works, which appears to late-apply any work it might do until its invoked by the context in which its working (e.g. as http server, cli, or just calling the function). Except they dont have any docs about how subcommands might work.
Evaluating Python for a work project and I'm coming to a rather interesting rabbit hole that I'm having trouble coming to a conclusion on. The dynamic typing with type hints seems to dampen the readability benefits to the language, but without it it seems kind of insane to develop software without any sort of types to catch potential bugs. Without near 100% code coverage on the unit tests that is. Is everyone just relying on unit tests then? What about code completion? Coming from a C++ background it's really throwing me for a loop.
PRINT IT AND HANG IT IN YOUR OFFICE
I'm a bit pre-christmas celebration inebriated at the moment, so forgive me if I'm totally incoherent. But did you try using parser.parse_known_args (modulo spelling errors)? As long as you don't have overlaps in the argument names, and remember to check that something actually have been parsed, the recursive approach could solve the problems if a regular subparser doesn't
CLI development in Python is ridiculous. We have so many frameworks, all of which feel less than ideal in my humble opinion. I just worked on implementing a CLI using Microsoft's Knack and even though it powers one of the largest CLI tools I've ever seen (Azure CLI) is felt awkward. Thanks for writing this I may try Click out next.
I answered why I consider spawning a sub-shell a bad move. My guess is that most people on Linux probably use bash anyway, but what their preferences about history and sub shells are, I'm not prepared to guess at. 
Is this with or without pip’s cache?
Now, can someone for real explain to me how to add environmental variables to my virtualenv? I could swear this was super easy in the past, but since coming back to Python I'm too much of an idiot to do it. I know I can EXPORT them, but they never seem to save. I could swear there used to be some file or something in each virtualenv that I would just add the variables to and save. Have I gone crazy? Maybe it's because I'm working in Git Bash for Windows now instead of on Ubuntu?
Stay classy, Python. 
Ah but the real money that should make you venv and docker is pip freeze. You can export darkboxofhorror.txt, then feed it and your crappy code to a stock python container and BOOM you're a bearded DevOps engineer ready to write books.
I demand a refund.
Or I just want a version of OpenCV built with certain extensions enabled... 
You can rebuild it with the recipe to suit. But we've found the menpo build to be fairly good. I haven't had to dig into it in a while thankfully. I hate that god damn package.
I know the struggle
I'm trying to get Vim to work properly inside of Docker.
swamp pip life 🙏🏿
I made an optimized automatic build that including optimizing all the dependencies and some optional modules for the Raspberry Pi 3. (gstreamer and all its add-ons, openjpeg, giflib, leptonica, libwebp, OpenCL, tesseract, TBB, and OpenCV Contrib) along with TensorFlow. A full build with updated dependencies takes like 26 hours on a RasPi 3. I made a repo on AWS for just it’s dependencies and itself and let it’s existence be known. I had to kill the repo in less than a month due to the rather quickly ran up $1000+ AWS bill. Everyone hates building OpenCV. I hate it extra special now after all that effort mucking around with it. The only package I hate with more venom is gstreamer.
Have you genuinely used python on a Mac? Honestly I feel like if you haven’t there are headaches you can’t imagine otherwise. I am well disciplined with virtual environments and every now and then some Mac specific thing will throw a spanner in the works 
Write date, time, names and phone numbers to a JSON file. 
You don't need new modules for it and you can use the file to store data for other scripts. 
How does virtual environments work in production? Do they even at all?
These days I've switched from `pipenv` to `poetry`. The latter feels much better designed and more modern. Yes, yes, I know, package installer ADHD.
If you’re willing to put up with a wee bit of easily scripted boilerplate, Docker is a better way to go. Not only can you install whatever mangled mess of Python libraries you please and keep the host system clean as a whistle, you can also do that with your entire environment.
They have bindings to a lot of old but high quality compiled code, like qhull (convex hulls, delauny triangulations, voronoi diagrams), KDTrees implemented in C, sparse matrices, FITpack for various splines, etc.
&gt; A full build with updated dependencies takes like 26 hours on a RasPi 3. Why not cross compile? Compiling the ARM toolchain and OpenCV on something else will probaby not be a 26 hour journey. 
https://chriswarrick.com/blog/2018/07/17/pipenv-promises-a-lot-delivers-very-little/ Try [poetry.](https://github.com/sdispater/poetry)
Unless they are being added to a file invoked when the env comes up somehow they won't survive rebooting the shell.
I’ve also been pretty happy with it. I’ve had to do some minor hacks stuff to make it parse how I want but it is usually pretty simple stuff. I mean, it’s far from perfect and I would change some things but it’s really not bad and I hate superfluous dependencies 
Step zero, install python with brew so you're not polluting the system python. After that you can make whatever mistakes you want with reckless abandon (and learn from them!) 
Some of the tools didn’t like the cross-compiling tools chains. Some have barely functioning make files. I’m sure I could speed up parts of it but I made a nice script and it was just easy to make it do everything. I still want to work through some of the cross-compile issues but I just haven’t done that yet.
I love virtualenv and have no problems with it but this made my laugh more than OP
Generally anything more advanced than plain numpy. It has tons of optimization tools, stats (and probability), signal processing, etc. Think of Numpy as being really about the `array` object plus some functionality. SciPy adds tons more functions and works on numpy arrays. 
Ah yes, superliminal messaging. 
Does virtualenv create a .env file for environmental variables? I could swear I remember editing something like that.
&gt; Some of the tools didn’t like the cross-compiling tools chains. Some have barely functioning make files. That would be a problem. Also, what kind of load did that repo of yours see? $1000 for AWS storage seem excessive. 
Alright, I got it. Thanks. 
I'm switching to poetry, too. I like the idea of the `.toml` file
There was 10s of millions of downloads and all the packages took up just over a gig in total. It didn’t help that I pushed a couple of fixes due errors in the packaging on my part that ended up updating the entire stack.
There’s the issue though with python ‘as a framework’ which is needed for matplotlib and such.
Can we please have more of these?
Dunno, I use conda which I don't think supports that. I'd just make an environment.vars file and issue a 'source' command before starting work. Or in docker it would be in my compose file.
Use tk to build a little program showing you the current time where you are now, and where you're flying to. Bonus: give a dropdown to select the timezone. Not too much, but not too little!
Maybe it's because I'm an old c++ dev who's only been coding in Python for a few years, but virtual environments are a solution to a problem I've never had. What the hell are you guys doing to get into these dependency hells?! 
Docked wouldn’t really address this issue though. Its more to keep your dependencies in check.
Yeah, there was a script for sure. Was part of the fishshell stuff. I had messed with it to tweak the git behavior once upon a time. But I didn't create or even set up the pipenv folder stuff. Would have never even crossed my mind. Unfortunately, I no longer have that machine, so I can't go about backing into exactly what I had setup, or I'd make a tutorial to get what I had going.. Maybe I'll dual boot centos on this machine soon and see if I can't get back to that point. 
Er... I have no idea what this means to be honest. Is matplotlib not executable within a given environment, i.e. with a particular PATH set? Cuz that's basically all you need for apps to use a virtualenv correctly. 
No, I can’t remember the details off hand but getting mpl to behave is an enormous PITA unless you do some very unintuitive stuff.
This maybe? Or similar? https://direnv.net
After about a month or so of the youtube tutorial addiction I realized i wasn't really getting anywhere and felt I was missing much info. I personally really love the official python Doc because as a newbie, it gives you a large scope of what to expect and the dynamics of python. Strings for example has many methods, and the string formatting all gives you tons of ideas from the start how you can program. It could be more clear and hold your hand better, but the tough approach makes you have to read closer and practice until it clicks. Sometimes in spanish class you gotta just pull the dictionary and read through the words...gives you an idea of everything early on so you know what to expect! &amp;#x200B; I personally love to read the official documentation along with other learning sources; I am probably one of the few who believe the documentation MUST be able to get you to a skilled level alone. Most importantly, you can learn by just doing; soon you'll have to use classes, tons of different modules, start considering your code's architecture &amp; flow, etc.

\`$EDITOR $VIRTUAL\_ENV/bin/activate\` Also, you should use Ubuntu for Windows at least. It's incredibly well-developed and even runs windows executable files in the same terminal.
Funny thing is that depending on how your distribution/os manages python, python may be installed without python3-venv, which `python3 -m venv` uses to create your virtual environment. At least, that's how it is when I have a fresh install of Ubuntu on Windows.
So fucking simple even a python dev could do it.

Program Conway's game of Life. Four pretty clear rules and really cool results to watch when you're done. Basically string formatting some output into the terminal.

Samesies, I came to this thread looking for things to do!
I do use WSL with Ubuntu, but when I do personal projects I usually end up working on a 3-4 different machines and I just haven't downloaded Ubuntu for Windows on all of them. I'll try that suggestion though. Thanks.
This isn't at all what I was thinking of, but this is super cool and I'll use it anyway.
thanks I really needed this
Still better than NPM where it will install everything including the kitchen sink. 
You use `pipenv`, since it's virtenv on steroids for managing package versions and whatnot. 
Sounds like you are a budding Pythonista who has never had to deploy in windows worst of the worst snow-covered/dessert conditions. Don’t worry, you may never love (Ana)Conda and don’t have to, but at some point you will come to respect the Conda for its ease and simplicity in setting up (other peoples computers (not yours)).
Super cool!
Master the pandas library, and on a related note, get really good at SQL. You'll use it no matter where you go. The other python stuff like flask is cool but you can explore that later in your career.
Poetry is really handy to use. It feels a lot like rust cargo.toml and node's package.json
If you’re using venv without virtualenvwrapper you’re doing it wrong. https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

Yeah, but I’m lazy and don’t like reinstalling everything every time I forcefully made pycharm not create a venv If you have an argument that trumps my laziness, bring it to me
Next thing you know, the cat will make you install a dinner bell and serve food in a bowllll..... You are already doing that, are you....
Awesome, this is very helpful! 
It's my first project to break 50K lines, so I thought I was doing pretty well for myself. 
Academia, where yes, I can move mountains to get this working if you really need me to but let's try conda first and see if we can't get it working that way so replicating this isn't impossible.
For just describing a Python environment you want to create, no not really. But that's not really what virtualenv is for. It's for when you need multiple independent Python environments that won't corrupt each other. The classic use case is to wall off your Python2 and Python3 environments.
What’s the -m option stand for? 
Searches the python path for a module name. 
Oh cool, so venv is just a normal module name? And I could do this with my own modules in my path too? That makes this easier to remember, thanks!
Hey there! Just so you know, this post should be in /r/learnpython instead of here! But as to your issues. &gt; I am also expected to learn python and SQL for this. They expect you to learn Python and SQL and don't provide any guidance on how to accomplish this? These are some serious undertakings. Do you have any previous programming experience? Also I believe ESRI provides some support people when moving new, large clients (like utility companies) over to their ecosystem, you might want to get in touch with them. What was the interview process for this job, out of curiousity?
This is a GIS question. Ask in /r/gis
Agreed.
Find the closest point of an n sided polygon and a position in 2d space. 
I don’t want to get into an argument here, but I think whatever works for the developer is fine. If async works for you, great. If you think something else is better, also great. Everyone is entitled to an opinion.
I have lots of questions because what you’re saying doesn’t make much sense. Esri isn’t a database so where are you migrating the data to? (MSSQL Or Oracle?) Esri does has File Geodatabaes but that’s a step backwards if you’re already in a true Database. Which leads me to why migrate from PostGres when Esri can already read from it in ArcMap/ArcPro. Secondly, FME makes ETL tasks stupid easy. They have free webinars and training videos on their website or, if needed, their chat support is awesome for helping. Finally, Python with ArcPy can do what you want, but if you have limited experience in Python and Esri you’re in for a steep learning curve. ArcPy has 3 versions (32bit ArcMap, 64Bit ArcPro and the ArcPy API developer) so you need to know what version your users are in and load that library. Ultimately, if you have FME I would stay there. 
I had only hobby level experience as well as basic java, c++, and database classes in my second year of college. So I had a decent understanding of programming fundamentals just had to learn specific frameworks that the company was using in which I started my Django journey. I never had any formal python experience as that was my hobby before university and I only built very basic command line scripts.

Best post I've seen on this sub, but should have poked fun at conda and all the other managers in there. 
It's a python, sql, postgres, gis question.
Because it’s the same workflow except less steps. Instead of running the container initially with a mounted volume storing your project (you’re doing this, right?) and just running fucking pip install -r requirements.txt inside the container, you’re just running a virtual environment in your local workspace. For me it’s not having to do anything with docker networking, or mounting a volume, or having to deal with a package manager, or anything. You can streamline a lot of that and there’s definitely good reasons to standardize on developing in a container (if you need/want specific other runtime deps outside of python, for example). But nothing really beats literally typing two commands to just start running your project. For python specifically I haven’t had any issues at all writing code on my mac and then porting it to prod in a docket container. Any real project I’ve worked on has a CI loop, so disparity between runtimes is checked on commits or PRs. Even more simply, not running a container or even a docket daemon unless I need to frees up 1/4 of my memory. Really it’s personal preference. I fully recognize the value of developing in a container. For me it’s much quicker and easier to just run a virtual environment.
`alias venv27 virtualenvironment -ppython2.7 $1` Now you can type `venv27 my_fucking_venv_name &amp;&amp; . my_fucking_venv_name/bin/activate`
I'm the rookie in the room that let's PyCharm handle all this shit. I also don't deploy my work anywhere than my own PC. There's that. 
Oh ok thanks!
Well, if you are posting it to a discussion board, where people discuss opinions... it's not about the right of having an opinion, which is inalienable anyways, it's about whether one opinion is correct in some sense. :/
Yeah, my bad. I didn't understand what the attack vector was.
What if I just need to do some math and make some graphs? 
Well, there is UML... but I wouldn't encourage it. https://www.logilab.org/blogentry/6883 claims to be able to generate that automatically, but I was never interested enough to try.
Learning python to get a job!
Python packaging and distribution tools are like that joke about a retarded family trying to put out a candle: Every new relative that appears on the stage does it in a more ridiculously retarded way, but the candle is still lit. So, you probably need to be asking for the not the worst option, rather than the best one. And I'd probably still shrug and told you that they are all bad. The trend however is that the newer tools are kind of more ridiculous, so, for myself, I chose to stick with minimal usage of `setuptools`, and, when time allows, do it myself instead of relying on PyPA to do its job. So, things I've discovered from many years of struggle with these tools are: - Best way to package your code is `sdist` format. Don't use Eggs or Wheels, it's a recipe for disaster. - Don't use `pip` to install dependencies if you can help it, it's a recipe for disaster. - If you need to roll out a deployment of multiple Python packages, don't even look for third party tools to do that, the ones that are there are laughably bad, but mostly they don't work, so there will be no disaster, it will just never lift off the ground. - If you can, build Python from source yourself, make everyone in your organization use the Python that you built, dealing with independently installed versions of Python will overflow your support's ticketing system. Essentially, this was my experience with bigger shops (50+ programmers) who did extensive Python development: most of them would write their own infrastructure. The freebies are just awful.
I'm more surprised how this image fits perfectly on my Note 9.

I've been working on a pet project for a few years now - it's a web scraping framework, primarily inspired by Scrapy. [https://github.com/AlexMathew/scrapple](https://github.com/AlexMathew/scrapple) &amp;#x200B; I haven't been maintaining it in a while, but I am looking to fix things up. I want your suggestions on what could be better. Thanks a lot!
Web GUIs are done in HTML/CSS/Javascript. Nothing to do with Python
You can't go wrong with windows defender and malwarebytes.
For packages you can also use [__main__.py](https://docs.python.org/3/library/__main__.html)
WHAT YEAR IS IT? WHAT IS THIS bin/activate THING? ARE YOU A SAVAGE OR WHAT? USE direnv.
In production you usually have only one python environment, or even a dockerized app, so there is no need to create a virtualenv. On the other hand, if there is a server instance with different python apps, you may want to separate their environments, so that their dependencies may be updated separately. Also, for serverless solutions like AWS Lambda you may use venvs to collect your dependencies and deploy with the code. 
And one person says one is better, and another says different, so it’s not a conclusive discussion, is it? If you want to further the discussion, or provide some evidence to one point of view, go ahead. However, try to keep it levelheaded.

You are correct thank god for linux/macos. I have had to do very limited amount of configuration changes on a windows server through console I can only imagine the struggle. At the same time if youre using a pip installable package that cannot be installed through anaconda. Getting control back of your filesystems is a pain in the ass 
The battle between wanting to do it pretty/minimalist/“right” and getting it working. 
If all you need is matplotlib and pandas I dont think you really need a virtualenv or anaconda. If you need several packages and are working on different projects probably should use virtualenv . If your packages requires a specific version of python get pyenv. If you want to use your virtualenv with that version of python pyenv-virtualenv will do that. 
One of these: [https://gitlab.com/users/mbarkhau/projects](https://gitlab.com/users/mbarkhau/projects) Or maybe a new one. I was thinking the world doesn't have enough task queue libraries.
Or just train your cat to call you on your cellphone. 
Maybe your training data needs more different cats. You could use a different neural network, in case your program detected a cat, to classify if it is YOUR cat. Not sure though if this would work with classic ML since this would be a dataset with VERY high class imbalance (Your cat: 1, other cats: any number). Maybe you could upsample this by taking a thousand of different pictures from your cat, and combine this with some other thousands of random cat pictures. 
Corey Schafer have great tutorials. Search for pycon for talks.
Fuck me I don't understand 
Firstly, type hints (mypy) everywhere, for example you could leave them off of your unit tests and only annotate the actual production code. Secondly, yes unit tests are what will ultimately have to catch most bugs. As for code completion, you should give vs code a try, the default python extension already does quite a bit.

At one point, I was working on 4 different python projects at once. Some of them were using APIs that, for example, used different versions of `requests`, so having venvs helped keep them separate. Another is when I build documentation with `sphinx`. I keep a separate venv for the docs so that no extra packages are installed to the main project

What do you mean “hide” the code?
It is possible, but this kind of interaction require handling a lot of cases in real life scenarios. Instead of "No", the user can input "Nope", "nuh", "n", "nah", "of course I am not why are you asking" and like this, and many others. While the cases you described can be done with some "if" statements, the script/application will be limited to a toy-app level. You can read more about this topic by searching about Natural Language Processing, but it's a more advanced topic and you should get the hang of the language first. Python also has some nice libraries that can help you in this, more precisely [https://www.nltk.org/](https://www.nltk.org/)
I agree, this does seem possible.
1. /r/learnpython is a better sub for these kinds of questions 2. If you indent your code by four spaces it'll stop reddit eating the essential python formatting 3. You should *also* include the error you are getting in your question. **Always** 4. You are passing multiple arguments to a function with only one parameter 5. From what you've provided apple, cherry, grapes and citrus are undefined.
By hiding, you mean obfuscating it so that 3rd parties that have the sources/built artifact can not get the original code, right? Well, I at some point I was searching for a solution and found: \- distributing \*.pyc files. PROS: easy to do, no extra tools required. CONS: easy to restore the original source code \- using a packer such as cxFreeze or PyInstaller: PROS: harder to extract the code, can be obfuscated further with other packer utilities such as UPX CONS: the code can still be retrieved, as it bundles the interpreter and the sources in the same executable, and the sources are stored as \*.pyc inside the resulted binary file. Can fail sometimes, on more complex dependency graphs \- using Cython. PROS: impossible to retrieve the original code without high financial/time investments, improves speed. CONS: has some limitations (eg. does not support class in class). Has a costly build step.

That's four pretty meaty questions in one post. I know they're overlapping to a certain extent, but it would be better to break them into separate questions (one per post). The more focused the question, the more likely you are to get good answers on SO. As a somewhat hand-wavey answer, CPython scopes are just dictionaries of variables that can be accessed from the current stack frame (e.g. f_locals, f_gloabls, f_builtins). For example, you can see in the LOAD_GLOBAL opcode where NameError is raised (for global namespace lookups): https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/3.7/Python/ceval.c#L2108-L2151 ...and similarly in LOAD_NAME (for local scope lookups): https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/3.7/Python/ceval.c#L2057-L2106 These functions also show the order of the name resolution by showing which dictionaries are checked and in what order.
I would consider this post as spam. This is the /r/python subreddit and you post three lines of bullshit. WTF? xD
In principle, Python allows you to extend the way packages are imported, this involves, beside other things, writing a dedicated loader, that has particular knowledge of the process of how to load your package. So, one thing you could do is this: 1. Encrypt your source code with your key. 2. Write a package that only contains the code for the loader to load your actual code that you want to protect. 3. Use whatever mechanism your business would use to supply customers with keys to decrypt your package. There are obvious downsides to this: error reporting by customers back to you will be very low quality. Your ability to debug a deployed product will be very limited, if at all. This is still, a protection against people who aren't too technologically advanced, it's not bullet-proof. It bears repeating: your best protection against IP theft is a good license and a good lawyer. The problem isn't really solvable through engineering means.

I am sitting on a Mac, my main development system, right now. I program mostly in Python these days and I really have no idea what these headaches you are talking about are. :-) Of course, I never personally use the system installed Python - I have clean versions of Python 2.7 and 3.4-3.7 installed, and then I create new virtualenvs for every new project or even when I'm just experimenting with a new package. If you're using Brew to install Python, that's likely your problem there. You want your development versions of Python to be completely independent of your system. Indeed this rule is true for _every_ system - if there's a system-installed Python, _never_ change it in the slightest. I learned this the hard way, trying to change the system Python on a Linux box almost a decade ago. (Looking at my notes, about six months ago I had some weird SSL problem with my 3.4 and virtualenv which seems to have resolved now, but aside from that I don't see much problematic on this machine...)
Step zero: **ignore the above advice**. That information is wrong and dangerous - it should not have been upvoted. Installing Python with brew changes your system. It interacts with other packages you install and puts things into your system PYTHONPATH. I believe it even changes things for other users on your system. More, it makes it impossible to have more than one Python version on your system. I support a couple of packages and sometimes I get bugs that only seem to appear on one version of Python - I have _five_ different versions of Python installed because of that and it just never gets in my way. The other day I had some issue reported in 3.4 only - I was able to fire up my 3.4 virtualenv for this project, see that I had used a feature that didn't exist in 3.4, fix it and be done in thirty minutes. You should never use brew to install Python under any circumstances. Why would you want to? What does it offer you? You don't need brew at all - you don't need _anything!_. Instead, just install the specific version you want directly from https://python.org, then either directly call the Python version you want, or (what I _always_ do) create a new virtualenv for each new task.
"Step away from the caps key! Keep your hands where we can see them!" I really am not seeing these big issues. At some point a few years ago, I organized all my virtualenvs and set up [some scripts](https://github.com/rec/dotfiles/blob/master/bash/penv.sh) to select them and list them. It was an hour of fiddling three years ago and since then I spend zero minutes a week on debugging it. When I start a new project I type: $ new-env my-new-project which creates a new virtualenv and switches to it. To switch to it later, I type $ penv my-new-project and when I'm finished with it, I type $ delete-env my-new-project But you know - these scripts don't even save me that much typing. I'm just lazy. :-D
A thousand reasons. Creating a Docker is large, slow, takes a lot of disk, and copies vast numbers of things that aren't Python. I have over a dozen virtualenv and I can switch between them instantly or just run a specific program one time in a specific virtualenv with one line and no overhead.

Do you use matplotlib?
For a beginner I would suggest using exception handling to handle inputs that differ from your expected inputs. This would prompt the user if they input anything other than what is expected. You might also want to add lower() method to force the input to lower case to better handle inputs. In theory if the user is human they should be able to read the exception and input the correct information when prompted with an exception message. If they are unable to correct the input you could assume that they are not human. You could also use an if statement to look at the first character of the input to determine how they answer. If the first character is "y" most likely the input is related to "yes" and if the first character is "n" you could guess that it is "no". IF input[0].lower() == 'y': input = 'yes' 
Is putting all your venvs in one place common practice? I make a new venv for every project in ./venv (.gitignore'd of course). The point of venvs is every project has its own dependencies, so having one directory per project in a central location seems more complicated than just keeping it in the current directory.
Good to see the *Deadwood* writers are still getting work.

is this trolling?
This is the wakeup call I needed.
One of the main things that scares me about using Docker in development is people just bundling up there dev image and releasing it to production. That's bad, it's completely the opposite of what it intended, where is zero reproducibility in the build process. If you just use Docker to ensure that you have the same environment/operating system as in production, then you'll still need something to manage packages, and for that purpose virtualenv will serve most people just fine. The situations where Docker is fantastic is those where you'd previously need to spin up a virtual machine. In those cases Docker is a fantastic solution, it much fast and much more comfortable to use. It's just that you'd never suggest just taking a vm and promote that production, nor should you do that with Docker.

So far so good with conda and pip installs. Conda by default has a standard library for every env that includes pip. Upon pip installing in am env it placed the modules in site-packages which Fonda scraps to update env inventory list. "Conda list" under the environment with a pip install modules results in the module being displayed with the header &lt;pip&gt;, it's pretty great.

No, you can just use the full path to the python interpreter in your virtualenv. 
Because you still need python 2, this isn't much help, but for Python3 you can do: python3 -mvenv envname That will give you a virtualenv with the interpreter version used for creating the virtual environment.

On my cellphone so can’t actually test this but here’s how I would approach it: Firstly, how large is large for this csv? If it’s over a few gigabytes you’ll likely need libraries to read partial files but if it isn’t, most in memory solutions should be ok. A great library to use for tasks like this is pandas. import pandas as pd from datetime import datetime df = pd.read_csv(“/path/to/file.csv”) df = pd.DataFrame(df[‘History’].str.split(“**NOTE**”).tolist(), index=df[‘ID’]).stack().reset_index()[[‘ID’, 0]] df.columns = [‘ID’, ‘Full Note’] df[‘Date’] = datetime.strptime(df[‘Full Note’].str.split(“ “).tolist()[0], “%Y-%m-%d”) df[“Note”] = “ “.join(df[‘Full Note’].str.split(“ “).tolist()[1:]) del df[‘Full Note’] Again sorry I’m on my way into work and I wrote this on my phone so there may be typos and may have messed up something but should point you in the right direction.

It's crude, but one way you could do this is just to have a function that contains the complete new format that you want and just write it over the existing json file. For example: with open("filename", "w") as file: json.dump(new_json_object, file) This will overwrite the old json object with the new one. However if you want to append items then you can use a list as a value for a given key in the dictionary. my_dict = {"colors" : ["blue", "green"], "numbers" : [1,2,3]} Then you can append the list that corresponds to the key. To my knowledge you cant append a dictionary, you have to overwrite it (I could be wrong, I'm just not sure how you could). These are probably crude solutions, but they work.
I know pyprotect. This will be compiled.
Aside from the projects I work on when at my day to day job. I'm freelancing and creating one of my client's sites with flask and a vuejs front-end. So far pretty cool.
Reinstall your os. 
If you make your virtualenvs with venv it will take care of that. So my setup is to ignore the system python, install 3.6 with brew, and simply venv off that every time. To be fair I still have a conda lurking around somewhere.

It means the length of line.split(',') is only one element instead of the expected two. Probably because there's no comma in the variable line.

What about EDM?
So it's a GIS question ;-) All kidding aside, I can't think of any specific documentation that will spell it out for you. The unfortunate reality is that you will have to hunt down the documents for each piece of the puzzle. This sounds like a fairly large undertaking so I hope your company doesn't expect this to be done in one day. Regarding support from Esri - don't expect too much. I can tell you immediately guiding you through this entire process is out of scope. At best, they can try to point out the documentation but this would normally otherwise call for a Professional Services engagement. Start small - you need to get from postgresql/postgis to, presumably, dbms X/sde. ArcGIS software supports certain versions of postgis bso you may be able to simply export/import the data and there are several methods of doing this.

Thanks for the correction bro
This guy virtualenvs.
&gt;ORM that requires no writing of classes for each table. I did something similar generating sqla models from table objects. and then also generating jsonapi serializers from the generated models. it's worked out pretty well so far.
I feel attacked 
my whole concept revolves around being able to access columns as attributes of "Row" objects. so if you have a column called "first\_name" you can access it as so: with Database("login", "password") as db: model = db.model("phonebook") for row in model.find(number\_\_\_like="555%"): print(row.first\_name)
l may not know what I'm talking about, but I don't get this. It seems very possible to install any pip package in a conda environment, is that not correct?
Literally python.org
Sounds like the only difference is that you download from python.org manually whereas I use a package manager (or, whatever you want to call brew). It does not affect the system python as brew operates within its Cellar directory. I use brew for the same reason I use apt and not dpkg (or tar!) - because it's easy to install/update, manages versions, and gives me a consistent interface to most programs I need. I go to python.org for docs, not downloads. Same as other poster, I have several pythons installed via brew and can switch between them as needed. And if I somehow ever mess up one of the packages I install globally (pip, virtualenv, virtualenvwrapper) I can brew uninstall &amp;&amp; brew install that version again. As I said it's step zero; step one is then to use virtualenvs for each project/task as you say. I am sure your method works fine and sounds like you have your workflow figured out without brew. But just as there's no need to use brew, there's no reason to *not* use brew either. It's all a matter of preference. 
I'd prefer if people would skip this resume of PEP8 and rather[ looked beyond that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf-BqAjZb8M) with Raymond Hettinger. 
Yes, exactly. Plus it has a saner interface and doesn't feel as cobbled-together.
I completely agree with you. PEP8 can be accomplish with verification tools, however there are others details to look at!
There's also [Py-Spy](https://github.com/benfred/py-spy) which works on windows and mac too, and you have the choice of outputting flame graphs and watching raw profiling data in real time.

That's super handy, thanks for the suggestion! I'm curious to see if it's smarter about finding the right Python libraries to link against.
I remember giving pipenv a shoot, then there was some administrative authorization issue with my terminal, then i said fuck it, never trying that again.
I've used a setup identical to yours for the last few years after making the mistake of replacing the system python on a Linux install. You can still get bit by a nearly pathological case: a configuration script that contains references to scripts using \#!env python in *most* cases. But with a hardcoded /usr/bin/python burried in there for a single subdirectory... hilarity ensues. That said, it's still the right way to do things.

I'm just the opposite, SnakeViz is much harder for me to grasp! Correct me if I'm wrong, too, but doesn't SnakeViz generally require running `cProfile` on your application? Not always a great idea in production unless you can funnel a small but representative sample of requests to the process you're profiling.

&gt; and mypy has problems with type annotations. Hm. mypy was *made for* type annotations... it's the only reason they're a thing in Python. What kind of problems were you running into? Now, if you just want feedback on syntax errors, I'm not sure if you want a linter? (they typically focus on code style as well) VSCode has an experimental mode that parses your Python live and warns you of syntax errors on the spot, and it can be used without a linter. If that sounds like what you want, try getting the Python extension then going into vsc's settings.json and adding `"python.jediEnabled": false`.
Also, if you're brand new to Python and already trying to create GUIs with Tkinter then that opens up a loooooooooooooooooong discussion on various programming topics that go into way more depth than your question. We could write the code for you, but that wouldn't help you learn. You need to learn how to make a console application and learn how to link functions and make a menu in that. Your original question is no doubt going to lead to several more questions which would be a very long forum post. I would suggest looking up Tkinter tutorials on YouTube and start learning how to build a GUI starting at the basics. Oh and also, this should be on r/learnpython

Then I am confused 
Hi, first of all, thank you for this release. I'm currently building a quart app deployed on Heroku free, and it performs much better than flask with a separate worker process. One question I have is about integration with asks, the async request library. Does quart-trio integrate nicely with asks when using: asks.init('trio')? 
Add four spaces before each line of code to format it as code in reddit posts. This is how code should look. I put 4 spaces before each line.
how about now?
how about now?
now we need one with pyenv + pipenv
Well first, I went into more detail and realized that indeed my annotations weren't good lol. Buuttt, I do have some problems with Tkinter objects too. I'll need to check in more details. The jediEnabled parameter is exactly what I was looking for in regard to my question though so I appreciate this alot.
It's still not perfect, but yes you get the idea. When you post code, you should post it like that so that it's actually readable. However, you still should be asking for code assistance in the r/learnpython subreddit, not this one. If you read my other post I explained that you are faaaaaaaaar away from making a GUI program that does what you want it to do. Explaining how to build a GUI application that does what you want is far more complicated than we should go into in this post. I would highly recommend learning more about the basics of Python and also watching YouTube tutorials on how to build GUI applications using Tkinter.
if you aren't performing analysis over huge amounts of data or trying to do some complex computations then excel is all you need. adding python into the mix would just make things overly complex for no reason.
I'm not sure sub-reddit mods have that capability, but that'd be awesome though.
I'll hell you
if excel solves your needs, why bother with Python? However, when you hit a wall with xl, and you are furiously VB/macro scripting, you might want to look at py.
Yeah, I was pretty confident that excel was meeting my needs well enough. And I'm definitely not VB/macro scripting at all, so I think I'll be right. Thanks for your answer!
At a high level there's nothing you can do in Python that you can't do in Excel. Excel even has some addons for Machine Learning, etc. Typically, volume is what will make a difference. If you are dealing with millions of records then Python might be faster. I was charting a small-ish dataset of about 50k rows and Excel kept crashing. The same chart takes seconds to run in Python. 
^ I had one of those, but the wheels fell off
I am not brand new per say but I still only know the basics. Anyway, I thought there was an easy way to do this but I was foolish to think so. I will take your advice to heart. By the way, I wanted to make this by myself (not some else to code it for me) as I would only cheat myself and not actually learn my self. So, thank you :)
Try coder.com, that's been my best method. 
Thank you for putting up with me. I know the basics of python (or most of the basics) so, I wanted to challenge myself to see how far I would get. Since, I started to realise that this requires a lot more advance coding than what I thought, I would go look through tutorials and slowly finish my project. Thank you for help me realise that and thank you for putting up with me:)
Pycodestyle is good and has plugins for most IDE's. Also look at Black although that is an automated rather than a true linter. 
Thank you I’ll look into it
All kinds of things. E.g., pandas releases often have a couple dozen [breaking changes](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.20/whatsnew.html#backwards-incompatible-api-changes). In a large, pandas-heavy codebase, upgrading pandas could be a huge update that might introduce lots of subtle bugs. It'd be something you'd want to test heavily before releasing.

These look neat!. This is the perfect use for OpenGL in Python because it allows for math-based graphics in an easy-to-use language and it is a use where FPS is not of importance. Is there any chance you can provide the source code? It would be great if you can post it in a code block or upload it to GitHub, PasteBin, etc. Don't stop coding!

`OpenPyXL` is another rapidly developing project with quickly depreciating classes and methods 
Most of what I've seen and done has been using Leaflet or D3 in Javascript for the visualization. Python's role is the data processing, spitting out a GeoJSON file for the Javascript to display. Check out [Fiona](https://github.com/Toblerity/Fiona) for a Python API for dealing with geodata. It's possible to render static maps directly from Python, but the Javascript presentation is so much more flexible it's preferred for any sort of web based visualization.
What about the Judean People's Front?
It's curious that there was so much discussion about *how* to vote, while there seemed to be no question who would vote. The article mentions there was a pool of 94 eligible individuals but doesn't explain further where they come from. Does anyone have more info about that? 
Dont know why youget downvoted, Black, like prettier is fantastic. No arguments, no decisions just write, format and your done.
I suppose it doesn't cover everything, like `naming_styles`. And people resent being told machines are better than they are at some part of their jobs, especially if they consider their role to be creative. Of course, IMO tools like black let you focus more on the creativity and less on the humdrum.
Or, GitHub.com/ambv/black for modern beauty
You should try poetry. I find it's more stable and faster.
Guido stepped down so they are voting for a new leader. Is that it?
Realistically posh is better for your environment. It is also a good career path the more advanced you get with it. I work in Windows envy but build everything with python and call things from posh and batch. But I just like Python and it is a bit of a runaround. I’m sure whoever takes over my position will be pissed too :) No reason you can’t do and learn both. I do posh, batch, python and c#. Once you know the syntax of a language they are basically all very similar and you can pick them up easily.
Because the only thing black does is creating PEP8 formatting. Take your time to watch the video I linked in my previous post. Black is a nice tool, but even though this example is correctly formatted, it's not beutiful. words = 1 SOMESTR = "Gaffelbidder i tomatsovs" for i in xrange(len(SOMESTR)): if SOMESTR[i] == " ": words += 1 print("There are " + str(words) + " words in " + SOMESTR) 
I'd have a look at r/Crostini Much easier than crouton and you don't need to be in Dev mode. I think I even remember reading a post about getting Python 3.7 installed sometime back in October... 
If you require joining/manipulating data or ETL type work, then Python with the Pandas library is infinitely more suitable than Excel. 
Wankers!
Of course, but since python indexes starting at 0, it’d be more representative. Me downvoting my own posts wouldn’t be noticed by anyone. But it defaulting to 0 would be noticed. If nobody thinks it’s funny then that’s cool. Just thought I’d throw it against the wall. 
The reason would be a Class called Analogous
Seconding this, it works great

If reproducibility is important, Python can be a lot more useful than Excel just so the process (how you got from A to B) is easier to see.
Thanks everyone for the help so far. I have to go to work soon. If anyone has some tips/advice on learning python let me know. Also some tools that can help. I’m a new learner and don’t know anything at all about coding. Also if you guys have any suggestions outside a chromebook OS, please share as well. My goal is to try to get set up with the best tools for a beginner and go for there. Thanks again
The only people we hate more than the Romans are the f*cking Judean People's Front.
The vote was held among "core developers" (https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-8001/#id9), which I understand to mean people with commit access to the main repository.
&gt; not beutiful More like a fucking eyesore jeez... I mean good job, that's a great example.
By the way this is just a demo (I just getting started on python GUI)
If you’re just running python you can use repl.it or google colaboratory 
Well, yes and no. Guido stepped down, with no clear answer on how to replace the role he had as BDFL. The core devs have determined what form of governance will take its place--a council of five. AFAIK the next step is to nominate and then vote on council members.
Whenever people start talking about how to vote, everybody has their own favorite methods, each one backed up with plenty of criteria in their favor. The 94 mentioned must have been recent CPython contributors. PEP 8001 laid out the eligibility criteria somewhat cleanly. I'd need to check, but 94 could be there unique count of users in the git repo with contributions since a specific date.
Missing closing bracket on line 18?
But wouldn't you need to be running two pandas heavy large code bases side by side in the same environment with wildly different versions? Is this normal for people? 
Bad bot
Got it. Thanks!
1: start by reading the sidebar 2: post things like this in /r/learnpython 3: read THAT sidebar.
But there is a closed bracket on time.sleep(0.5)
You aren't closing the bracket when you create `lbl2` 
wut
You open a bracket for Label and one for font but only close one of the brackets, then move on to the next like to the .grid For lbl2
Lol why are you even subscribed to coding sub forums?
ill do it for just 15 u.s dollars an hour.
Try vim as that is a well known cleaner.
Oh thank you! see the mistake now. I needed to change it from lbl2 = Label(Window, text="Welcome to the main menu", font("Arial Bold", 30) to lbl2 = Label(window, text="Welcome to the main menu", font=("Arial Bold", 30)) thank you :)
Np :)
Do you really expect people to go through the new section before posting something? No. it's not a big deal at all.
A great place to learn from others and ask questions is stackoverflow.com. In a lot of cases, if you have a question, someone else has asked it there already. Many of them have 2 or 3 good answers. If you can't find your question there, you can ask and people are pretty quick at providing answers. Reddit isnt as good for that, and it isnt really designed for that. Stackoverflow is.
But now it says 'SyntaxError: positional argument follows keyword argument' on line 11: lbl = Label(window, text="your score is: ", score) 
I expect them to react when reddit tells that the link already have been posted.
Thank you, I’ll look into it 
I expect people to follow rediquette on reddit, which you aren't by complaining about a repost.
I think it's pretty foolish to suggest you can "never" ignore pep 8, when one of the first sections of the actual pep 8 is titled "A Foolish Consistency is the Hobgoblin of Little Minds". The number one concern of following a style guide is to make your code more readable, and it's pretty laughable to suggest that pep 8 will *always* lead to more readable code. I tend to lean towards the interpretation of Raymon Hettinger when it comes to Pep 8. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf-BqAjZb8M
Are you trying to print out the score alongside the your score is:?
If you are about to ask a "how do I do this in python" question, please try r/learnpython
Use Pycharm
except Exception as e1: pass 
yes
Instead of the variable try textvariable=score, it may have to replace the original text in which case you'd have to create a new label with that text and place it to the left of this with grid 
Once again, thank you! It now works:) lbl = Label(window, textvariable=score) lbl.grid(column=26, row=1) lbl3 = Label(window, text="Your score is:") lbl3.grid(column=10, row=1)
:)
Python would be useful, but I'd probably get comfortable with Power Shell first since you're in a Windows environment. Also, a few of your ideas *are* something you could program, but are large projects, and the business's money would probably be better spent on a commercial solution that already does that. This is primarily in regards to the inventory and logistics management.
Talk to your professor r/learnpython Nobody wants to do your homework.
And for completeness sake: [yapf](https://github.com/google/yapf) I have yet to develop a preference for either.
Azure notebooks lets you code in Jupyter notebooks online. Might be worth checking it out if you don’t want to find a version to download on your local.
They don't have to be wildly different, just different. You don't even have to be working on them extensively. We often code review projects that different teams are working on. It obviously wouldn't work to say, "Hey, before I review this PR, can you upgrade all your dependencies to the latest version?" Or worse, "Can you downgrade you dependencies to what I have installed on my machine? I'm not ready to upgrade quite yet."
Could Cython or something be used to speed it up even more? Hell since Python in this case, unless I'm very wrong, being used as an interface for OpenGL commands, you could translate python directly into compiled code and skip out interpretation entirely..?
Python 'Dad' here: The hard lesson-learned that you shouldn't-ve waited till the last second is *more important* than a freebie from a stranger on the internet. Talk to your prof, tell them you messed up and are overwhelmed. Ask for an extension (perhaps from one of your essay-profs, up to you). Don't do this next time. Good luck. &amp;#x200B;

While I agree that Raymond's talk is great, I would say that it's geared for the people that become PEP8 Nazi's. Raymond himself agrees that PEP8 is important, but a completely strict adherence to it for PEP8's sake is ridiculous and that's what he addresses in the talk. This would be a great tool for those that are unfamiliar with PEP8.

1. Write any old shit 2. \`black .\` 3. Go back 2 years later and still have no clue what the hell I was doing/thinking This is why you cannot rely on tools entirely to do your work for you.
Sure, just translate it to C. /s Yeah, that would definitely help, but realistically no one would write any graphics program that is performance-dependent in Python. This, on the other hand, is pretty simple and does not need blazing-fast FPS.
I use Pycharm as my IDE. You can also configure VIM to lint for Python.
A while ago I wrote a review of three different methods of running Python and other Unix based tools on a Chromebook: https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/using-a-chromebook-for-web-development. From those options, the one that I've been using with pretty good results is Crouton. I'm currently working on a follow-up to that article that covers Crostini, which is the new and official solution to run Linux on Chromebooks. Keep an eye on my blog to catch the new article in a few days! In the meantime I can tell you that if you are lucky to have one of the Chromebook models that support Crostini you'd probably want to try this option first.
Thats fair enough. Of course there's balance to be made, but I love the concept of lowering barriers for higher performance programs, especially 3D, through python. Even low perf. in this case is a great service in at least getting people into 3D programming who would otherwise struggle with, for example, using monogame.
Isn't R typically best for data analysis? 
It's good that we're moving to 2FA for PyPI submissions, but I'm concerned that the budget is on the small side at $33-40k. I also think PyPI should be building binary wheels based on source uploads instead of trusting users to submit executable code, which is what currently happens, unlike just about every other open source project. The malicious code that's been caught on PyPI are the ones dumb enough to embed their code in a plaintext Python file. A binary wheel with clean Python and that calls poisoned compiled libraries would be much harder to spot. Is anything being done to test binary wheels?
You can debate PEP8 but some standard is better than none... and PEP8 is a pretty well defined standard easy to integrated with most editors. Line length is only rule to ignore.. cause common.
To make the bot are u willing to contribute?
I never heard about Lazycli. I just read the doc, it seems magic!
Yeah, definitely. Python is great for demonstrating concepts and prototyping. I was just saying that production games and software probably should use a language with higher performance (at the cost of ease of use). Hopefully as Python gets faster and computers get better it will become a more viable option. Python already is excellent for machine learning by allowing easy prototyping and changing of parameters while using compiled libraries to do the heavy lifting on GPUs.
Check out all of Raymond's talks, he's great 
If i ran into that exact issue in my environment, i would remove old dependencies and install new ones 
I would definitely suggest using python over Excel. If you use an application like Jupyter Notebooks and libraries like pandas, numpy and matplotlib it can be very easy to handle even with smaller data sets. Python comes in handy when working with data that is updated on a regular basis. Your reports will look better and more professional. You'll save time when creating regular weekly or monthly reports that ask the same questions. Don't base you decision on the size of data because databases grow and data is constantly updating. 
For sure, I was just telling you how it relates to the wider world of projects.

How many hours this will take u?
I think Go was more of a purpose-built language, the equivalent of what an ASIC is in the hardware world. In the grand scheme of things, it's really inefficient at certain operations - but it was built for a very specific purpose and only that purpose. 
I have, but they kind of skip over how to get started with Python and REST. And skip straight to the calls etc. that you should use. It's kind of like I'm immediately in over my head without knowing the basics. Do I need to run a server? I've done it before with something like MAMP. I know there is a "request" Python library that is useful for using REST. I guess I'm kind of just stuck with getting that part set up, if that makes sense?
I can give you a project... Hook up an ELM327 OBD2 adapter in your car and bluetooth it to a Raspberry Pi system that crunches the data. [https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=212221](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=212221) [https://www.instructables.com/id/OBD-Pi/](https://www.instructables.com/id/OBD-Pi/) [https://python-obd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/](https://python-obd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
you can write and run scripts from any computer that has Python installed and an Internet connection. to interact with HTTP-based APIs in python, check out the [requests module](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/)
I mean, you do you, but that seems a lot more annoying than having a separate environment for each project that you can update separately.
People’s grin of Judaea?
Core developers and of that inactive core developers that don't feel like still contributing should not vote. Thus 64-ish.
This was to vote on the governance model. As requested by Guido, they're going to take a break and come back to it January 23rd or so and start voting February 3rd or so.
If ur not gonna help, fuck off.
As the other commenters have said, you're better off learning PowerShell (aka PoSH) for your professional development in a Microsoft-centric environment. If you were a Linux admin, Python would be a more sensible choice. Python, however, will be much more useful to you personally. It is possible to do the things you want with Python, but it can be challenging and complicated ([https://github.com/diyan/pywinrm](https://github.com/diyan/pywinrm)). Learn both! :)
Trying to get back into this. I'm a beginner and I've basically dropped studying python for the last month, and I need to pick it up again. Any small projects someone could recommend to make? 
I'm still learning the basics. Been doing some work with python lists, numpy arrays and geopandas datagrams. Next stop loops!
Please tell me more about ETL. I've seen it mentioned a few times in job descriptions recently. Do you have any tutorials?

That's a major version bump I believe. You don't want people to upgrade a minor or patch and suddenly be unable to use it on their version of Python, which the previous version had supported.
Breaking changes require a major version bump with semver. So if a user on 3.3 tried to upgrade your library and wasn't able to use it because of the keyword, that would be breaking for them. Also, `async` also became a _reserved_ keyword in python 3.7 you probably want to bump up anyways to avoid that issue.
I'm Nina Zakharenko -- the host of the series. If you have questions, comments, or feedback send it my way. 
I completely agree. I hate doing things like cleaning up data in excel because I quickly loose track of what I did (like if I deleted certain rows for some reason).
I just purchased a chromebook, and am using Crostini for learning and practicing python. So far, no complaints. &amp;#x200B; Not being in Dev mode is a huge plus for me.
Hi there, from the /r/Python mods. We have removed this post as it is not suited to the /r/Python subreddit proper, however it should be very appropriate for our sister subreddit /r/LearnPython or for the r/Python discord: https://discord.gg/3Abzge7. The reason for the removal is that /r/Python is dedicated to discussion of Python news, projects, uses and debates. It is not designed to act as Q&amp;A or FAQ board. The regular community is not a fan of "how do I..." questions, so you will not get the best responses over here. On /r/LearnPython the community and the r/Python discord are actively expecting questions and are looking to help. You can expect far more understanding, encouraging and insightful responses over there. **No matter what level of question you have, if you are looking for help with Python, you should get good answers**. Make sure to check out the rules for both places. Warm regards, and best of luck with your Pythoneering!

The reason for the removal is that /r/Python is dedicated to discussion of Python news, projects, uses and debates. It is not designed to act as Q&amp;A or FAQ board. The regular community is not a fan of "how do I..." questions, so you will not get the best responses over here. On /r/LearnPython the community and the r/Python discord are actively expecting questions and are looking to help. You can expect far more understanding, encouraging and insightful responses over there. **No matter what level of question you have, if you are looking for help with Python, you should get good answers**. Make sure to check out the rules for both places. Warm regards, and best of luck with your Pythoneering!

&gt; t. &gt; &gt; Talk to your prof, tell them you messed up and are overwhelmed. Ask for an extension (perhaps from one of your essay-profs, up to you). &gt; &gt; Don't do this next time. I completely understand, this class just an elective for me, I m an architecture student and just spent the last two weeks with about a total of 15 hours of sleep working up for my review, I'm honetly just trying to get a passing grade in this class
No i understand, the class is an elective for me. My major is architecture and i spent the lat two weeks working on my important projects. I was just trying to look for an easy way out.
As someone learning python using a Pi I really appreciated this as well. 
Yeah In order for an open source application of any sort to be useful it must be so usefull my grandma can use it to create something cool, let's shoot for that when having these elections!
Could [websocketd](https://github.com/joewalnes/websocketd) be used?
maybe closer to this? SOMESTR = "Gaffelbidder i tomatsovs" num_words = len(SOMESTR.split()) print("There are {:} words in {:}”.format(num_words, SOMESTR)
Yeah, it is basically a focus on [this small, oft-ignored part of PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#a-foolish-consistency-is-the-hobgoblin-of-little-minds). &gt; A style guide is about consistency. Consistency with this style guide is important. Consistency within a project is more important. Consistency within one module or function is the most important. &gt; However, know when to be inconsistent -- sometimes style guide recommendations just aren't applicable. When in doubt, use your best judgment. Look at other examples and decide what looks best. And don't hesitate to ask! &gt; In particular: do not break backwards compatibility just to comply with this PEP! &gt;Some other good reasons to ignore a particular guideline: &gt; ... ^^^...Also ^^^fuck ^^^spaces ^^^for ^^^indentation.
The folks involved in the project do not like dependencies in languages other than C and Python. Thanks for the suggestion.
