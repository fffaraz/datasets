Here's the [source code](https://github.com/Zaverose/Terraria) &amp;#x200B; This is in no way polished, and I am very much a beginner so I would love to hear criticisms and learn more to improve my code!
I looked into this and it's worked pretty well. Sine I'm doing gaming that's sort of fast paced, I've gone for this method and it looks pretty awesome!
I need to learn a bit more about flask before I can do something like this so I'll stick with UDP that you recommended :)
Sockets seems pretty simple to set up considering I did it with visual basic years ago and I'm not so sure on flask at the moment, and it's working pretty well with sockets, so thanks for the suggestion!
I'm vaguely familiar with this but I don't know how it reads the screen... I guess I'll ask the developer, thanks for pointing this out to me :)
Felt pythonic...might delete later.
&gt; Edit²: TIL: This question apparently is quite controversial. It's one of those ones that people have killed each other over, yes. Along with the correct date of Easter and the exact syntactic format about where the Holy Spirit comes from. Theological controversies can be weird.
Why do you ask questions that the answer is irrelevant to your life? &amp;#x200B; Because you fucking can.
If someone wants to get it they will, no reason to sacrifice so much performance
I get where you are coming from, but I disagree, I would much rather have a program that read from stdin, as then I have the flexibility to pipe the output of a other program into it. Even if you just want to use a file, with no prior reprocessing, you can just do &gt; ./script.py &lt; file
No Problem.
I would use UDP to send the key signals and flask just to host a site where you can configure or maybe also show some stats.
"Soon" Good luck with that.
I'd be in. Send me a PM when you get started
I'm in. Been programming Python for years. It's mostly been automation and hardware validation for the silicon industry That said, I've been wanting to get into graphics programming beyond Tk but, excuses. If you're willing to put together a plan and start the organization process I'd be happy to lend my experience. PM me when this all goes down
I'm a novice when it comes to programming but let me know when you get started and I'd totally be up for some collaboration
I posted this cause I like it. The title was tongue in cheek with regards to the "I am n years old and I wrote x".
Fail though.
I never recommend Pycharm for newbies. It does way too many things for them and they are unable to debug stuff themselves. I'd rather they use VSCode, sublime or notepad++. They need to learn how to create virtual environments themselves. And how to debug imports.
It depends largely on the use case. If your service doesn't have any frontend (say a backend microservice to serve ML model predictions) then Flask + SQLAlchemy + Celery (instead of Django + Django ORM + Django Channels) will get you all of the functionality you could need without any of the other additional pieces and "batteries" that you have no need for (like views &amp; templates, admin panel etc). This is a good ground up approach where you can just reach for a library only when you need it. Maybe you don't need a database or complex background tasks at all and you can run a whole service off literally one server.py file!
You can create a temporary file out of stdout like this: \`./script.py &lt;(command-that-outputs-to-stdout)\`

Strings always need to be surrounded by quotes. Also this should be in r/learnpython.
This would only work if the program accepts the input as stdin, which is exactly what I am arguing for. At least in Unix, the better way to achieve the same thing you want to do is exactly do use a pipe: `command-that-outputs-to-stdout | ./script.py` Which I think is the more elegant solution, as it can be stringed together with other commands. For instance, in general, `command-that-outputs-to-stdout | sort | ./script.py` Sort here could naturally be replaced by any other program that reads from stdin and outputs to stdout.

Yeah, I was actually hoping anyone would help me out with some tips? Is it just a matter of trying a bigger model? Is there anything else I should try?
In case you're wondering, my knight dialer solution using this same methodology is: knight_moves = [[4,6],[6,8],[9,7],[4,8],[3,9,0],[],[1,7,0],[2,6],[1,3],[2,4]] todo=[[1],[2],[3],[4],[6],[7],[8],[9]] done=[] while len(todo)&gt;0: workon = todo.pop() for move in knight_moves[workon[-1]]: full_list = [*workon,move] if len(workon)==6: done.append(int(''.join([str(i) for i in full_list]))) else: todo.append(full_list) done.sort() print(done)
No one gives a flying fuck about your secret sauce, until they do, and when they do, they're going to get it no matter what language you're writing in.

Should be pretty simple right...
When you've gotten an answer to that question, I have a new one for you to ponder over: Why have you never heard about [Pyramid](https://trypyramid.com/)?
What does golfed mean?
No, it's process substitution. It creates a temp file-like object, and it's meant for programs that don't take stdin. Or when you need to provide multiple streams as input, e.g. `diff &lt;(command1) &lt;(command2)`. and `command1 =(command2)` actually creates a temporary file with the output of command2, and passes the filepath to command1 as an argument.
Why in gods name would you pickle them? That just makes it impossible to view or edit without writing a script. This isn't a complex python object. It's just a couple of dictionaries. Use JSON.
My bad... Ever tried giving good advice while you just learned something new and were under the influence of Jack Daniels?
TIL! Thanks!
Is this a bash-ism? It seems like this may not work in fish/dash/etc.
I think this is misleading advice, I don't doubt that you've done your due diligence, but for domains like numerical processing there is no way one should be using builtin python data structures (which are not designed for performance, have a lot of overhead, and poor memory locality). Pandas is fine for simple data processing in the 0-10GB heterogeneous data range and the authors are aware of performance limitations (performance of blockmanager, groupby, etc, ergo pandas2). I'm guessing your workload was not in this domain or the code you had to work with was poorly written.
Sounds reasonable, but also maybe the sidebar rules are not obvious enough. Because every time someone asks for help it's always a new developer or student having "just learned python". I don't have any answers on how to make it more obvious without being annoying to everyone else, but these newbies just don't read. They need to learn to read!
Can't share the specifics as it is a client project. If you have related questions, please feel free to ask.

Woo hoo!
No need. If you really must prevent code-theft (..really .. is it worth the hassle?), you can take a few of your core python modules and compile them with Cython. No code changes necessary. Note, this doesn't provide "true" security but it raises the bar on the effort required for decompilation over python byte-code (which is trivially easy to decompile). Frankly, shipping just the .pyo/.pyc files is sufficient in most cases but you did ask.
Sure, switch to C++. Winking at IDA Pro + Hex Rays
Anyway, it's not a real Spotify downloader, it seems a YouTube music downloader as it getting audios based on YouTube. Fortunately, I have found an alternative but true Spotify downloaded, called AudFree [Spotify Downloader Mac](https://www.audfree.com/spotify-music-converter-mac/), which can not only download Spotify songs from Spotify app but also convert Spotify music to MP3, FLAC, WAV, AAC, etc. Maybe you can have a try of this tool and see what's the difference between yours and this one.
First step would be formatting the code and splitting it into several files. Definitely needs organizing, to make it more readable.
/r/learnpython and read the sidebar.
All right.

I don't think \`CamelCase.py\` files are PEP8ish Rename to \`snake\_case.py\` for consistence. Also avoid mixing the 2 types. [https://github.com/KonigKlack/Weather\_Text](https://github.com/KonigKlack/Weather_Text)
Oof, bunch of useless marketing copy. 1/10, would not read again.
Accepting it as an argument is not sys.stdin In any cases you can easily have it take both a file as an argument and be able to pipe into stdin, and that’s the best way here. So if no input file is provided as an arg just have it hang at stdin
in command line options use -aa 1 to reduce the computations.
Flask isn't suited for larger websites, but I've seen it used for microservices that are deployed with Docker
I use Firefox. 😊
You're right, and I really need to dig in one of these days and clean up a ton of stuff like this. I actually have Weather_Text done but some super strange merge conflict was haunting me yesterday and I was unable to get it pushed up. Being sick as all hell AND at work didn't help much either.
&gt; but for domains like numerical processing there is no way one should be using builtin python data structures Python native data structures are much faster than Pandas for this &gt; Pandas is fine for simple data processing in the 0-10GB heterogeneous data range and the authors are aware of performance If you say so. If you have some GBs of data in memory in a Pandas DF I would be very surprised if it isn’t more than a magnitude slower than doing the same with native data structures &gt; I'm guessing your workload was not in this domain or the code you had to work with was poorly written. So, yes, code that uses Pandas when it doesn’t need to is by definition poorly written. You just can’t put it in a production pipeline, even if they are doing it intelligently, because the time it takes to simply create/load a Pandas DF is longer than it takes to do the entire processing step with a native data structure. You’re just wrong here And yeah I am dealing with 10s to 100s of GBs of data all the time and have to come up with creative ways to deal with memory issues. And personally I think Pandas becomes unbearably slow very quickly, again, in the time it takes to load even a 100 MB file I can be done with the entire processing step if I use native data structures
And if you’re talking about numerical processing like matrix math or other maths then I agree, it’s better to be using Numpy data structures or numba but it definitely is not better to use Pandas DFs

I'd be down to help out. Been programming on and off for about 10 years. The past two years I've been using python professionally for scripting out management and monitoring processes.
`1 &lt; x &lt; 10`. It's such a simple thing but always makes me smile.
G.O.T.
What I usually do for any new projects: &amp;#x200B; 1) Create a private repo 2) Get it working. 3) Polish up README file. 4) Polish up code - PEP8, Do some refactoring. (I use black for formatting). 5) Make repo public. 6) Share it.

Thought heavily about saying "fuck it" and building my own github server on a vps as well then figured it'd just be too much damn work for what it's worth. But I still wonder...
Looks good. * Do you consider this to be an alternative to behave/Cucumber ? * Do you use it to test production software ?
I believe using 3 quotation pairs would be able to do this. print("""\ Usage: thingy [OPTIONS] -h Display this usage message -H hostname Hostname to connect to """)
&gt; Do you consider this to be an alternative to behave/Cucumber ? Nope, haven't tried those yet. Started using it to test a production grade piece of code. It is an analytics server. Will play around with it for a few more days and then might ask other devs in the org to adopt it.
Are you sure it's 'printing' without the newline? In python, there is __str__ and __repr__ methods that help 'print' types. If you ran the following in the REPL: C = {1: 'C\n'} print(C[1]) You'll see that it correctly prints newlines. If you instead do: C = {1: 'C\n'} C[1] It will show 'C\n'. 'C\n' is the __repr__ (representation) C is the __str__ (basically 'ToString')
So I'm a bit of a noob when it comes to asyncio, but do I need to actually create the tasks myself? I've got some methods that I'm calling currently sequentially, but they don't really need to be (each method hits separate REST API points, the only thing that is done after these methods are called is merging the results). This feels really weird/wrong though: @classmethod def _my_method(cls, param): async def call_methods(func): return await func var1 = call_methods(list(rest_endpoint_method1(param))) var2 = call_methods(list(rest_endpoint_method2(param))) combinedVars = [*var1, *var2] return jsonify(combinedVars) vs. @classmethod def my_method(cls, param): var1 = list(rest_endpoint_method1(param)) var2 = list(rest_endpoint_method2(param)) combinedVars = [*var1, *var2] return jsonify(combinedVars)
I'm not sure what your asking nor what your code is supposed to do, but I don't think that's the intended way to use asyncio. Rather, you'd probably do something like: async def get_spam(params): var1, var2 = asyncio.gather(rest_endpoint_method1(params), rest_endpoint_method2(params)) return jsonify([*var1, *var2]) Then you can do `asyncio.run(get_spam(...))` in a synchronous function or `await get_spam(...)` in an asynchronous function.
`yield from` and f-strings. Which is my favourite depends on which project I'm working on and if it needs more streaming or more string manipulation.
So where does the await come in then? Since usually when using an async you need to have an await somewhere to pair with it.
Right until you write `a == b in c`.
Apologies (that's what I get for writing snippets without testing them!), you need to replace the `asyncio.gather(...)` with `await asyncio.gather(...)`. With "in a synchronous function" I mean any time you're not directly inside an `async def` function.
It's all good - so if I understand you correctly, what I should end up with is something like this: @classmethod def _my_function(cls, param): async def call_methods(param): var1, var2 = await aysncio.gather(rest_endpoint_method1(param), rest_endpoint_method2(param)) return jsonify([*var1, *var2]) asyncio.run(call_methods(param)) I guess I was also getting confused because a lot of the asyncio examples I tended to see had a lot more logic going on inside the async part compared to what I was trying to do with it (which is just calling methods and doing something with whatever result I got back)
Or worse, someone writes `5 &gt; x &lt; 10` or something.
`5 &gt; x &lt; 10` is at least _obviously weird_.
Its the basic things like something: step step ... &amp;#x200B; and its just so satisfying to declare variable with "var = value". imaginve vasting time on PuUbLiC StAtIc VoId InT VaRiAbLe; VaRiAbLe = VaLuE; or worse.
Impressive. You watching, Cisco?
I used icecream for awhile but would probably go with PySnooper in the future.
the concept here is "separation of concerns." you're trying to combine the data layer and the presentation layer. the data shouldn't care about how it is presented and shouldn't store formatting, and the formatter shouldn't have to take into consideration what is stored in the data to do its job effectively. it will be cleaner if you format the output elsewhere

Golf is a game where players try to minimize their strokes. A [golfed][1] program is one where the programmer has tried to minimize its byte count / character count. Single-character variable names, little-to-no-whitespace, and non-obvious use of things like hex codes are common in golfed code. It's fun for its own sake, but the hideously unreadable resulting code usually isn't going to get anybody a job. [1]: https://code-golf.io/
I would, in this particular case, actually do this: @staticmethod async def _my_function(param): var1, var2 = await aysncio.gather(rest_endpoint_method1(param), rest_endpoint_method2(param)) return jsonify([*var1, *var2]) @classmethod def sync_my_function(cls, param): return asyncio.run(cls._my_function(param)) This way, you gain composability, as you can use `_my_function` in an asynchronous pipeline, should the need arise. I also took the liberty of making it a static method, given `cls` isn't actually referenced in it.

I just finished creating a new Dev machine in which I want to have 32 bit and 64 bit pythons running with vs code and utilizing environments and it was not easy to get it working seamlessly. I'd love to see a tutorial on the proper way to do this that makes it easy to triable switch between bit versions and environments. What would be ideal would be a chocolatey package to do all of this for you.
Thanks so much. I needed prompt-toolkit 2 support, and pyinquirer isn't moving on that.
Love the idea. And would like to join the efforts. I'm rather new to Python so (\~6 months of learning evey day). Hit me up if you start the project :)

ITT ppl dont know what syntactic sugar means
It is relatively easy to have multiple Python versions on Windows. AFAIK, each installation will have a separate entry in the Start menu and a link to open a command prompt window with the respective Python version from which you can create virtual environments. Once you have a venv created, use the settings.json file from each workspace (like in the video) to specify which Python environment you want to use. When you open a workspace/folder from VS Code it will automatically pick the Python version/venv specified in the settings file. Alternatively, use the *py* launcher to select which Python version you want to use.
I would enjoy joining this, if you got some ideas and want to setup a discord and GitHub repo i would greatly like to participate
thank you so much! last question if you dont mind answering - you are currently the sole commit right holder to fastapi. are you planning to create an org like flask/encode/falconry/etc ?
Thank you! I was not aware of the py launcher but it certainly makes it easier.
If the complaint is that people can write shitty, ambiguous code where it's not even clear what they were trying to do, I would make the argument that that's not a Python-specific phenomenon. All that's really needed here is parentheses.
Haven't tried yet, but this could be it: [https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/debugging#\_remote-debugging](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/debugging#_remote-debugging)
That's actually not the complaint - the complaint is that `a == b in c`, `(a == b) in c` and `a == (b in c)` are all evaluated differently, because the `in` operator is, for some reason, subject to comparison checking, so `a == b in c` actually desugars to `(a == b) and (b in c)`, which is _neither_ of the things you expected it to possibly be.
This allows `a in b in c`
Yes, but it also allows `a &lt; b in c`, which is _a lot less obvious_.
Oh, I don't like that at all. I mean I guess one could make the argument that if you wanted to do Boolean comparisons / inclusions, you would explicitly use parens? Do you know when was this added?
It's like an emoji...
It was like this since forever, basically. `in` is considered a comparison operator.
What does that expand into??
I'm in. Sounds interesting and fun. I've made some simple ASCII games before, but would love to try my hand at something more involved.
Super weird, but all inall you're saying x &lt; 5.
Context managers are high up on my list. Handling resource lifetimes is always a mess.
(a &lt; b) and (b in c)
yeah good point, it is And the latter syntax is a zsh-only feature I think
All the operators are the same precedence. So it's left to right. [Py3 operator precedence](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#operator-precedence) In fact all the examples of people saying it's confusing are all just read left to right. So the initial example of `a == b in c` is evaluated left to right, and the one you replied to `a &lt; b in c` is also evaluated left to right. The confusion is coming because these expressions are evaluated the same as chaining numeric comparisons. Something like `5 &gt; 4 &gt; 3` evaluates to true. It allows comparing `5 &gt; 4` and `4 &gt; 3`. What it's **NOT** doing is `5 &gt; 4` is True, then `True &gt; 3`. If you show the numeric example to someone they go "Yeah, that makes sense. 5 is greater than 4 and 4 is greater than 3". This behavior doesn't change just because you start working with a different variable type. But people seem to think it should. So if we assign some values to the `a &lt; b in c` it could look something like this. a = 4 b = 5 c = 6 a &lt; b &lt; c # True. 4 is less than 5 and 5 is less than 6. # Now if the variable type changes and the operator # changes, it's still evaluated the exact same way c = [5, 6, 7, 8] a &lt; b in c # True. Checks if a is less than b, and that b is in c. So when I read things like &gt; which is neither of the things you expected it to possibly be. I wonder why there is any confusion at all. I can only assume it stems from spending a lot of time in another language where expressions are handled differently. So going to Python they are expecting the same behavior. Even though the behavior in Python is consistent. It behaves the exact same way whether you are chaining comparisons, membership, or identity tests. And when the variables being compared are ints, strings, floats, iterables, etc. Always the same.
To me, `a &lt; b in c` is sort of a nonsensical expression. Looking at it and thinking about it, sure, you can get what it does. But one of the beautiful things about Python is that well written Pythonic code is easily read and understood. Mixing expression types in a statement like that isn't either. If I needed this expression, I'd write `a &lt; b and b in c`

So I've got most of the way there - I had a look into [this series](https://pythonprogramming.net/game-frames-open-cv-python-plays-gta-v/) which has helped with the image recognition part of the project, just in case you wanted to know if anyone else asks :)
&gt; If I needed this expression, I'd write `a &lt; b and b in c` Ditto. I was curious and went looking through some of my projects. Searched for `(&lt;|==|&gt;)=?.*(not)?.*(in) +`. The majority of the results were comprehensions. ex: `math.gcd(n, i) == 1 for i in range(n)` I did eventually find a single time I used a comparison and membership test in the same if statement and sure enough it was if amount &lt; 0 and pay_component in PAYCOMPONENT_ADDS_PAY:
Context managers!
Thank you, this explanation clarifies it 100%
Interesting. I really like that feature, to the point where I roll my eyes when I see a language that requires a return statement to be explicit.
I would imagine so. I'm rather new to the language but one super way you could do it is have a string as a parameter and then have a for loop go through each letter of the string. Then you could have 26 if else statements saying like "if [variable for the first letter] == "a"" and then have it print out the art for that letter.q
Sentdex on YouTube is a great resource.. you might want to write alongside him, and learn by doing. Also , think of some simple projects that you’d like to try, and go to work on stack exchange. Little by little build your repertoire, and try to learn the right way to do things. That’s how I taught my self, but it is a long process:. It has taken me about 4 years off and in to get to a somewhat comfortable spot skill wise. Pandas is your friend also.
Thats a good idea! I need to start coding that. Thanks!

How is this better than doing the following? 1. "virtualenv env" in cmd (if you're using linux and need to work with python3 it's virtualenv -p python3 env" otherwise it defaults to the python2 installation. (This is also a problem in your video which makes sure it does NOT work on Linux or Mac OS) 2. Command-palette: "Terminal: create new integrated terminal environment" 3. Command-palette: "Python: Select intrepreter"
Quite interested in this.
theres a python plugin for intellij, it was the original pycharm. However, I have no idea how up to date it is. I've had the all products pack for yours now, and I consider it worth it.
I cant give you specifics because all the stuff I listen to is NLP related, but podcasts might be what you're looking for. Find a couple podcasts that cover whatever topic you're into and subscribe, your phone will automatically download it and notify you if you activate that setting.
Another handy option sometimes, not needing external debuggers: import code; code.interact(local=dict(globals(), **locals()))
Assuming x is a sane numeric. But custom types can make it do anything
You have to have a standalone module that parses things like this and reminds you what it does.
Decorators. I love decorators.
If you're using IDEA Ultimate, you can get all of the features of PyCharm by just installing the Python plugin.
Thanks. This looks very interesting. What exactly do you want to do with the image recognition?
Yeah, something needs to be done to finally solve the "how to 'compile' my Python script to a standalone executable?!" problem. Such questions are being asked on r/learnpython and Stack Overflow nearly every day, yet nobody seems to have a definite answer. You can use this, but it works only for Windows, and it also breaks code that uses `Matplotlib`. This thing has been kinda abandoned for a few years, but it kinda works. And kinda doesn't... And there's also that thing which works on macOS only, but not really, since it has tons of limitations. Maybe this tool is the answer?
PyCharm Community Edition is free, so you can try it (it's still _free_, so there's no time limit or any noticeable limitations of functionality) and see if it's worth it or not.

Well, the video was recorded on Windows. It stands to reason that if you want to *adapt* the instructions for Linux or macOS you will need to do a bit of research. For Linux and macOS one would typically use: python3 -m venv your_env_path
I feel like I give this advice all the time but just pick a highly rated book/course/YouTube series and stick with it. Even if you arent interested or it doesn't seem interesting youd be surprised what is useful later. I took way longer to learn than i should have because i kept starting from scratch and having to cover the basics again because most places teach it in a slightly different way. Dont get caught up in analysis paralysis like so many do.
Dang 4 years? Have you worked with it professionally at all? I started a job that basically let me learn from the ground up 2 years ago and now I'm extremely comfortable with my skills. I always feel like I have a lot to learn but I'm in a spot where if I'm given a project I can get it done quickly and done well.
https://docs.python.org/3/ go through the tutorial here, and you'll know python. after that you need a direction. data science, web back end, ai etc. and study frameworks used for those.

Suggestions for podcasts? I have found a few data science podcasts but nothing very interesting (yet)
I agree with the tutorial posted by @WarBird2K . That is a really good starting place. Another one was posted in here a few times. I think it is called automate the boring stuff with python. It is free on line or you can do a video tutorial for a few bucks. In general, just get on a tutorial to get the basics then start a project. Do something for fun that you like. Plan it and then code it. You will find that you need to keep learning different things as you go. Keep iterating and learning. Pretty soon you will be there. Have fun with it tho.
i think it is. i pay for the all products pack and have no regrets i know i could get the same functinoality out of idea, but having the dedicated IDEs for the various languages allows for a more focused developer experience
It's good that you tried to answer them and it's even better than you will think more about the questions due to the absence of answers.
Like you mentioned book would be the good way to start. Have been using online learning website pluralsight but not as helpful as i thought. Thanks
Thank you!!
Preach it, brother! But other uses are, of course, fine. In fact, I propose that Python 3.8 should include a new `bean` operator. if x bean y: ... The semantics of this is left as an exercise for the reader.
and its cousin, Generator expressions. /thread
Boy, I sure don't. They're awful. @likes_decorators def heygiraffe(): ... On second thought, I guess they're okay.
Yeah I have a bunch but I'm outa town away from the phone I get my podcasts on. If I remember when I get home tomorrow I'll update you. But if you look around a bit you'll find great podcasts on everything from high level discussions to specific technical details with particular algos.
As far as I know, the plugin is updated in lockstep with PyCharm. They probably share 90% of the code base.
TEXTJOIN is exactly what I was looking for, thank you!
I remember the first time I saw a list comprehension. I was pairing and we spent an hour or so writing a function. And then after we were done she said “oh wait, this can be done in a list comprehension”, rewrote it and my mind was blown.
Naw the stuff i couldn't answer is niche stuff I would probably never use or bother going out of my way to lookup but am just curious about the answers. I appreciate your thinking though, thanks for the response.
Not possible + possibly illegal
No, I have learned it on the side; and while also Doing a few freelance gigs or small scripts for my employers .
I think the reason for this is you're asking the wrong question. Python isn't a compiled language. In most (sane) environments, there is built-in support for executing scripts and there is an overabundance of resources to accomplish distributing python packages and installing them.
Damn. What kind?
&gt;Then you could have 26 if else statements saying like "if [variable for the first letter] == "a"" A better idea would be to create a dictionary with 26 letters as keys and ASCII arts as values and then search each letter in the string in that dictionary. Much cleaner and much easier to extend, if you'd want to add another symbols aside from a-z.
That shows impressive tenacity for sure. If I didnt end up breaking into my field I would have forgotten everything I learned on my own long ago.
Update - I recently wrote a debugger that is included in the base PySimpleGUI package and also as a standalone debugger that was released as the \`imwatchingyou\` package. This same debugger is directly integrated into PySimpleGUI. Just press the BREAK key or Control+BREAK and you'll get one of the two windows. You can look at that code to get an understanding how I did a REPL within the GUI. Here's a screenshot of the REPL portion of the debugger. Not only can you manually enter in REPL commands, but you can also place "watches" for particular variables. [https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13696193/60038891-78053480-9683-11e9-8824-23c078b55d9c.png](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13696193/60038891-78053480-9683-11e9-8824-23c078b55d9c.png) &amp;#x200B; One feature I think you really wanted but wasn't available in my debugger yet is that ability to create variables on the fly. The screenshot shows a variable "x" first as not defined, then I entered \`x=10\` and was able to perform calculations using it.
I'm on the fence about decorators. They can easily be abused and will look horrible, but when a decorator is self-documenting and simple, like `@property`, `@vectorize` or `@lru_cache`, it's pretty awesome. When, on the other hand, there's like five decorators with arguments in front of a function (like in the case of Flask), it can get ugly real fast.
Do you want to just practice your python skills or the end result? Cuz you might want to take a look at the figlet tool (for Linux).
Where do I find the syntax for that third bit? I could see this being handy. Or is the _ just a throway nonce since you'd only need first, second, and last?
I generally listen to this one https://www.pythonpodcast.com/
Maybe possible, but more complicated than a $150 Job i would think
&gt; Spaces **and** tabs And?! The horror!
Wrong answer.
Yeah the python debugger is shit tho
I’m looking forward to that myself. Can’t use it in my current projects though.
Personally, my favourite is the `return` statement.
It is possible to create something like this but will 100% be against ToS considering the captcha is there to stop automation.
This looks neat. I wonder if it plays nice with libraries like Halo, that end up breaking when you build with pyinstaller.
Game engines usually sandbox the engine disallowing external scripts/file access. There are hacked together solutions for some though.
I don’t use a debugger. I find logging and error messages more useful and actually reading the code then I know what the code flow is instead of guessing and trying to find it out with a debugger.
Had to Google the `=(cmd)` case. Apparently that is a `zsh` thing. I mainly use `bash`, so it threw me off.
The important syntax is the star. Unpacking to a star results in a list of all the other elements. In this case it is assigned to `_` because it's a throwaway. https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#assignment-statements
I have been using PyCharm for last 5 years. I haven't found any other IDE which is this good.
Yes, `_` is a throwaway. `*` unpacks all the intermediate array items into it.
That matches my experience, i think the two have a different release cycle, where th eplugin may need a intellij update, which it will then update, where as pycharm gets it all in one update.

Im also a beginner with python. I’d love to help out!
I love challenges, and this has been the driving force behind my learning:: though, when the challenge is beat, this is when tenacity is necessary to continue learning for me
Next step to learn new things : add a Cython ( [https://cython.org/](https://cython.org/) ) compiled version. Nice exercise otherwise.
I do that all the time...without the Jack Daniels
What if your "script" is an app with a GUI, like a game? You don't want to require potential players to install Python and, say, PyGame, because the majority of them will just go away and play another game since very few people will want to mess with all of that. So, you need at least some kind of installer that will contain your code and all of its dependencies, so that one could unpack it and run the code straight away. What's more, as the site says, the end user shouldn't need to know that the app is actually a Python package. In fact, knowing this may make people annoyed and/or afraid of messing stuff up while installing the package etc. And again, if installing your program requires opening terminal, this will scare away lots of potential users. Having a bundle that would "just run" your Python program would be much nicer. Also, Python packages are meant for developers, not end users, so this whole topic doesn't really apply here. Built-in support for executing scripts is also for "power users", not your ordinary clerk or gamer. So, it looks like at the moment there is no go-to solution for distributing _any_ Python code to _end users_ that want to just double-click the executable.
I’ve only ever heard a certain CEO of a certain startup call it that. Is this a widely used term? What exactly does it mean?
I have a full jetbrains subscription. I still use vim quite a lot, but I personally think its still worth it to support some good tooling for software. I like them as a company and their tools are good, shhh and take my money.
Thank you for the link. I'd figured that _ would become a list from [3:-1], but searching for "argument unpacking" yielded guides, not the official docs.
Can’t say enough good things about the book “Fluent Python” by Luciano Ramalho. Can find a free PDF version if you do a little searching. Personally enjoy having the book as I can pick it up whenever I have a free few minutes at home and flip through the pages.
Ah shoot. Sorry for the inaccuracy

I like both. I think it depends on the program. Also, if you know that both `stdout` and `stdin` are `tty`s (like `[[ -t fd ]]` for `bash`, and `fd.isatty()` for `python`), I like to print a message to the user: Reading from stdin until end of file (Ctrl + D)... When I was first learning about Linux I had programs just hanging there, waiting for input, because I used the wrong flag or forgot to include something. It was confusing, so now if I know the user will see it, and I'm not writing to some other programs input, I'll add the little message. I remember a couple other programs that did this, and it always helped me realize what I had done. Also the `Ctrl + D` thing, I used to just kill the program with fire because I didn't know how to give it what it was asking for.
Great catch! Yes, and not just custom types, but just having x being anything but numeric will surely break it.
I'd love to work on a project like this. Combining Computer Science with Climate Change fighting is my professional life goal.
For that you want a compiled language. Even with a valid interpreter directive you can’t guarantee dependencies (unless you pack them with your code). Of course, with a valid interpreter directive and no file extension you can make your script look and act like a program. Make it location aware and it can have a lib folder (your game probably has resources too) Still requires python, but java apps require java, so there’s that...
Does the command need to be terminated? Maybe try arduino.write(b'G28 Y\\r')
Unless you're dyslexic then it makes it both easier to write and to read

I like PyCharm with the following caveats: * the spelling inspection is going to drive you batshit crazy and I'm sure you'll disable it * there's an issue with pipenv that can creep into creating new environments: if you have a Pipfile and Pipfile.lock in your home directory, it uses the same environment for every project
From the look of your code, I get the impression that with some work it can be done more pythonic. For example: def DNAtoRNA(DNA): RNA = "" for c in DNA: RNA += RNA_CONVERSION[c] return RNA Could be replaced with a comprehension: def DNAtoRNA(DNA): return "".join([RNA_CONVERSION[c] for c in DNA]) Or better yet, use `str.translate` and `str.maketrans`: dna_to_rna_tans = str.maketrans(RNA_CONVERSION) # ... lot's of stuff rna = dna.translate(dna_to_rna_trans) Another one could be: def RNAtoDNA(RNA): return RNA.replace("U", "T") Which is basically what your function does, but walking over RNA char by char, and concatenating against the DNA string (which is super inefficient and a pain point in performance and readability in Python). You could also use `str.maketrans` and `str.translate` to get the job done here too.
1) Ask in /r/learnpython or /r/kivy 2) Post the code, it isn't possible to debug without knowing what you tried to do. Does the code actually try to run an app?
Just looking at your Python templates: why the massive license block at the top instead of [SPDX-License-Identifier](https://spdx.org/using-spdx-license-identifier)? Also, what's the difference between the three "templates"? I haven't noticed any major ones at all. Also, why do you need `main_project` declared in `run.py`, and why do you need `run.py` at all? Also, no `setup.py` or `pyproject.toml` or whatever other build configuration.
[TestDriven.io](https://testdriven.io) - a side project that I started focuses on teaching mid to senior level developers.
Cool project and I'll definitely keep an eye on it. For the moment, there are two points in the docs that make me worry: * https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/status.html#c-extensions Broken C extensions are show stopper for many projects, if not most of them. The problem is really hard and I hope pyoxidizer authors find a way to solve it reliably * https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/packaging_pitfalls.html#reliance-on-file This seems like a minor issue, but there are surprisingly many open source projects that realy on `__file__` trick - most prominent of them: Django. Long time ago I started [exxo](https://github.com/mbachry/exxo/) which tackled both issues with promising results. Unfortunately I abandoned it, because upstream project (PyRun) was unmaintained and at some point there was a sudden surge of new issues related to increased usage of manylinux wheels (which are a great thing, by the way). I hope to get back to exxo one day, because despite somewhat hackish approach the initial results were pretty good - for example, I was able to build standalone versions of Sentry and jupyter+scipy notebook. I'll be happy if pyoxidizer authors find some inspiration in my old pet project.
Reliable artifacts are useful for distributing any (that I can think of off the top of my head) applications, so I like that someone is thinking about this, whatever the end solution ends up looking like. Also appreciate walking through the Ansible use-case, as I have run into that problem in the past and it got my brain thinking about some applications of these ideas.
This video made me want to gouge my eyes and ears out! it was about 4 minutes too long, seriously please stop posting basic shit! /r/learnpython would probably benefit :)
I've got one 15% discount code for one year individual license for PyCharm, if anybody wants it, PM me
I used to do that too, but when I started working on a really great project I saw how inefficient it is.
While I agree that the problem isn't solved, why should one think that this project will solve it where so many others have yet to succeed? This sounds like yet another take on PyInstaller/Py2exe/cx_freeze (bundling the interpreter and code into one file), and has yet to even achieve their levels of functionality.
I’m definitely going to check that one out. Has anybody tried to package/distribute an app using PySide2 / QT?
Well, the more takes - the better (probably).
 I have been in the process of rebuilding a term based stock price predictor based on one I built several years ago to reasonable success. I have some new Python code to seed the application with stock history but I do little bits at a time. You can find it here: [https://github.com/matthewmetzgerx/pyStockSeeder](https://github.com/matthewmetzgerx/pyStockSeeder) I am gradually going through and automating every part but figure it will take me some time.
I \*think\* what you want is something like this: &amp;#x200B; # Presumably, you want a data structure where the value is # a meaningful string, perhaps a message - so no newline here # (Another poster mentioned separation of concerns, that's the # right idea here c = { 1: 'C' } # So if you casually print it the repr will # be on one line (and similarly for larger dicts) print(c) # {1: 'C'} # One think you can do is just print the keys and values separately print('# My dict:') for k, v in c.items(): # These will print with __str__ so won't show # surrounding quotes or escapes for strings print(f'{k}: {value}') # 1: C #You can mix and match this approach using variations # of reprs and strs. # You can also use a prettier printer: from pprint import pprint # A core module! # This will still print on one line for this dict # but will spread it across multiple lines for # larger dicts pprint(c) There's also the [ipython pretty-printer and its extra repr functions.](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/generated/IPython.lib.pretty.html)
Not a python issue. .py files by themselves are just text files.
What do you get that's beneficial? I've never felt limited for anything except web dev stuff which I just use VS code for
Yes.
Maybe. Though likely it will just add one more thing to the list of "you can use this, but..." solutions.
I dislike f-strings. Not because I dislike the syntax. But because it flies in the face of "there should be one and only one obvious way to do things" maxim. Concatenation, c-style substitution, .format, and f-strings are all 'obvious' (there are more that are obscure). I also doing like prefix syntax. It reminds me of perl. I realise that it has existed in python and even C in things like 0x for hexadecimal. And python previously had r"", u"", b""... But it is a syntactic form that I don't like. I sort of wish f-strings were the default behaviour, because I like the functionality.
&gt;
I used community edition for a few years, then switched to paid version. There are some differences, e.g. template debugging, better Django support (?), and something like that, but the main point for me was that I use the IDE so much every day that might as well support their development a bit, it's less than $8 a month.
I really like the python ternary, compared to say C. Yes, I know that it isn't always the most implicit, but it sure looks nice. x = something if condition else otherthing
just use jupyter with extensions, Python is already an easy to use fast-prototyping language, its waste of resource to use weightful IDE, thats my opinion ...
If you're interested in doing simple problems like this in order to learn python, [Rosalind](http://rosalind.info/problems/list-view) is a good place to start. This problem is the 8th on the list.
&gt;noticeable limitations of functionality uhm yeah there are. Docker, Django, diagrams would be my top 3 missing things
realpython.com has some solid articles on various topics that intermediate pythonistas will surely enjoy learning from :)
Except... you can still see the code if you use certain debuggers, visual debuggers. You’re not really guessing for anything, you set breakpoints where errors might’ve occurred and you work backwards from there. I don’t think you’ve ever worked on a larger project
Haha accurate enough, got me to the right webpage!
Need to look into template debugging and see if it's worth harassing my managers to get me pro edition.
Sorry I didn’t read the article yet, can someone TL;DR this question: Will this allow me convert any py file into a working .exe?
Docker works with it
Unfortunately it isn't :( But I've found this [issue](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-python/issues/1078) on VSC's github, which we can upvote so they would implement it faster!
Debugging with PyCharm is sooo nice....
&gt;imagine wasting time on pUbLiC StAtIc VoId InT VaRiAbLe; VaRiAbLe = VaLuE; or worse. imagine not knowing how to use your tools.
Most modern solutions are web based. As long as you use common sense regarding security, there is no difference between languages, and maybe even no way to tell which one you are using, since the source code is not exposed. If you really want to have your code "hidden", do web.
I get all the other products too, so it just means I have some continuity between languages in terms of the interface. Also data grip for perusing databases is cool. I think the professional pycharm has a bit more in terms of profiling, maybe the integration with matplotlib/scipy is better too (I havent used community in ages). Overall, I'm not paying for things that I use everyday, but qhen I do go to use them its nice knowing they're at hand and well maintained. Importing keras in the new tensorflow 2.0 doesnt work for example, but its good being able to see the upvotes on the topic and drive features I want forward.
If you come from Matlab you might want to look in to Conda. It comes with both Spyder, a data scentric IDE as well as jupyter notebooks. How to start depends on what you want to use Python for. As long as you don't need Simulink there should be a python equivalent.
VS Code is much more flexible and have more features in plugins.
Or if you are in college, then you can get Ult for free, while in school.
ToS isn't law.
&gt; if you have a Pipfile and Pipfile.lock in your home directory Why would you do this?
I cannot even begin to describe how productive PyCharm is over Jupyter.
I wouldn't do it. I somehow ended up with them there. PyCharm support couldn't find an issue. I finally found those files, deleted them, and then everything worked. While I don't know how they got there, I believe it's a pipenv issue.
PyCharm's autcomplete and redactor was way better than VSCode. Believe me I tried to use VSCode so much, as great as great PyCharm is it's a memory hogger. I tried like 10-15 plugins for python dev, never got experience like pyCharm. Plus out of the box support for so many features that I considered PyCharm. VSCode is great nothing against it I mean like millions of Devs use it so it's gotta be great,
Type out what you want the characters to look like into a text file to get them to look right. When you've done that you need to get all these strings into your script by either loading them from your text file or hard coding them into it. Then if your output is three characters, the first line of output is (first line of first character) + (first line of second character) + (first line of third character).
Well there use to be two templates but I thought I should split the program into program for things that will require lots of modules and require a setup,py and example template that doesn't need setup,py unless it's an example that uses setup,py then I will manually set that up. The use of 'main\_project' is just calling 'main' from 'src/main.py'. The 'run,py' file well be removed as soon as posable and replaced with some other way of running things from root.
Where are the answers?
Every Python project should have a `setup.py`, or (preferably) a `pyproject.toml` or `Pipfile`, even applications. The build system is how your application can be installed easily.

Dict comprehension. Now that's next level
Gotta love when title and content language don't match.
As already said, you want a different language. Python is great, but it's a tool to accomplish certain tasks. The task you're describing is better accomplished with another tool. That's why there aren't more options for compiling and distributing python scripts.
It's an allowed way of writing something that doesn't add any functionality to a language, but makes some functionality more easy/pleasant to express.
Look up those videos on YouTube that say “Learn Python in 4 [or 6 or 10] hours”. Those are a good place to start. Then look for more “tips and tricks” videos to make your coding more Pythonic. Then learn the libraries and dependencies that relate to whatever job you’re doing/want to do in the future.
To get familiar with syntax, I'd recommned [Automate Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) or Codecademy). Then, start using Python instead of Matlab in your daily projects, as soon as possible, you'll find what you need on the go. Have a look at Numpy, Scipy and Matplotlib, they all scientific libraries that have Matlab equivalent functions. Happy coding :)
I'm not sure what you mean?
No, the best Python editor is Emacs.
Short answer? No, not ANY py file, but a lot of them? Probably. Depends on the project, is the real answer. There are a few things mentioned in the docs that don't work (C-extensions (big one), lack of \_\_file\_\_ support (not as big, but big), actually distributing produced .exe files, etc.) but all-in-all it looks very promising. So if your project is pure Python, it SHOULD work; however, if you use modules that rely on C-extensions (and that's quite a lot of them), then you're going to have a bad time.

Found the java coder
But not debugger.
What's worth the money is the debugger alone, in Professional you can debug Python, Django templates and this includes full introspection, stepping, conditional breakpoints, you name it.
The last bastion of the Perl supremacist falls to the ground in tatters...
If you are doing ML and such Jupyter is way better
either how useful `zip` is `&gt;&gt;&gt; dict(zip('abcde','12345'))` `&gt;&gt;&gt; {'a': '1', 'b': '2', 'c': '3', 'd': '4', 'e': '5'}` or `python3 -m http.server` which serves the current directory on HTTP
Yes it is (Debugging, Plugins, SCM, Jupyter notebook integration), Community Edition is enough and free.
Those are environments wherein executing external scripts are not supported.
I've used both extensively, sorry but for python vscode is just passable while pycharm is amazing.
Oh. I guess so? But these environments support calls to external binaries?
I just love this!
I have professional so I can't test, but according to [their website](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/features/editions_comparison_matrix.html) docker is part of the paid features. With integration I mean to be able to debug and compose inside your actual docker image.

Great work! I’m gonna buy the book
Thanks mate:),how did you found this though,i thought it was buried too deep now to get comments.
I don’t know. I just appeared almost at the top of the r/python list.
Never mind,I can be stupid at times
Some non english talks have slides in English, so following them isn't too much trouble,
I love PyCharm, I’ve been using it for 3 years+ I don’t think any other IDE has what PyCharm has to offer. Yes, it costs money, but it’s worth it.
I usually just do what LeAstrale said except with conda environment and works as a charm! On windows.
Dude probably meant within a list. To be fair, this set of questions needs to be copy-edited, as I lost count of grammatical mistakes.
I like Wing IDE [https://wingware.com/downloads/wing-personal](https://wingware.com/downloads/wing-personal) Debugger built in, pretty straight forward to use in terms of fleshed out IDE's. Just my opinion. I've had one issue after running upgrades on Linux, it registers as installed, but the icons all disappear, I can run it via terminal. All my programs stay and load, in it similar to NotePad++ as an off the top example. I like it more than Pycharm.
Thanks for the offer, I would in that case go full package.
Thank you. Enjoy the platinum as thanks. Your response is much more helpful than the downvotes I’m receiving.
So I'm mucking around with some led strips and getting them to do different animations etc on keypresses and depending on what's on the display while in game, just for fun really, but I want to make it link into a twitch chat bot at sometime aswell
Nobody said there is a single, one true way, to work with environments. In the past I used to recommend Miniconda for simplicity. At this time, I think that the *venv* module already included with a normal Python 3 installation works just fine.
True, But the reason my code is so sloppy is mostly because I had made this in like 2 hours
Not exactly what Im looking for but thanks.
I’ve been paying for it for over a year, and I’ve tried VSCode as well, I say it is super worth it, the database connectors, ssh features, debugging, everything is very good
Very interested in this tool. Im going to have to give it a shot. Ive got an application that I created to handle some authentication at work by a custom URI. So I've been trying to find the best way to package Python for use on macOS given the possibility that scripting languages will no longer be installed by default after Catalina.
I’ e rewritten an entire class in a dict comprehension. Probably shouldn’t have, but I did!
I use the free edu version of PyCharm. I’m a relative beginner but I like it.
I had heard about 'setup,py' being use in newer Python project, infect Meson has a '[setup.py](https://setup.py)' file but what is the deference between using a 'setup,py' verses a 'pyproject,py' or a Pipfile.
Sounds interesting. But maybe it would be worth a thought to choose C++ for this because I think when you are gaming you can reach a better performance with image processing
I don't think this is very accurate. &amp;#x200B; However, I do enjoy these questions in "Middle". &amp;#x200B; &gt;Q: What is the output: -12 % 10? &gt; &gt;Q: What is the output: -12 // 10? &amp;#x200B; They are deceptive...Well, the first answer makes the second seem deceptive, but only because negative modulos behave differently than expected. &amp;#x200B; &gt; Q: What is the difference between Python 2 and 3? &amp;#x200B; That's either an amazing question, or an absolutely terrible question. &amp;#x200B; If the answer is "2 is not 3" or a variation, then it's a hilarious question that plays off the suggestion of there being one difference. "What is **the difference** between Python 2 and Python 3?" &amp;#x200B; If the answer is each and every change, it's a terrible question.
I know I can get a bit "obsessive-y" about optimizing, but take a look at translation tables and `str.translate` \-- not only is it less code (so some would say more readable -- if you know how `str.translate` works!) but it can be quite faster. A quick test on my machine it's giving me a \~10x speedup, and it's probably also less memory intensive, since it builds the new string on the spot.
I discovered conditional breakpoints with vscode yesterday. I started creaming myself.
I was assuming the author was a non-native english speaker.
https://github.com/trekhleb/homemade-machine-learning Sure you did. That's why you included the referrer spam.
Thanks for the detailed response! It's very helpful.
I use django and there are some neat features behind the paywall. My most convenient one is the navigation to the templates from the function. There is an icon in the gutter, and clicking it will open the template file.
I use pyinstaller for my GUI python programs.
Huh, imagine that. If you don't learn how to properly use a tool, don't be surprised if you think the tool is unsuited for the job.
Unless you're collaborating on large systems with multiple people I'd say the pro edition isn't worth it, you can definately more than get by with the free edition / other IDE's to get by, I just use vim at work.
/r/learnpython read the sidebar what?
I tried VS Code before PyCharm and what turns me off about it is the autocomplete, it's a bit buggy sometimes
!RemindMe 3 months
To folks interested in this space, please look at PyUpdater— it’s fantastic.
Sorry, what does this do?
I think the discount code I have is only for PyCharm...
I love vscode, I wonder what everyone else thinks, I'm also limited by the fact it's available on the approved application list at work.
Emacs is *just* an editor. What about all the other features of an integrated development environment?
How, if the feature list is considerably less and you can run Jupyter notebooks from within PyCharm anyway?
which can also run within pycahrm, so you have best of both worlds
I’m a PhD student who will teach Linear Algebra next semester. I intend to teach them also a bit of programming through Python+Linear Algebra. Do you mind I use this and/or I contribute to it (if I can)?
Tell them the Delphi IDE is $1500 and doesn't compare to PyCharm community edition and then they'll feel like they're getting a bargain.
You guys who use PyCharm, don't you find the UI is ugly? Atom and VS Code look great, both are running on Electron. PyCharm looks like crap, like everything running on Java UI.
Haha what? How did that go? I can't quite picture it
Still have yet to figure out why I would use Jupyter in pycharm. Is it just being able to debug in the ide?
UI is the last thing I check in an ide. I mean come on if an ide that doesn't work, no matter how pretty it is, it's useless. PyCharm's UX I also don't defend but I would rather have an ide which works for me instead of pretty editors. PS: it runs on Java and it performs adequately so no complaints there. VSCode people said it performs okay. Atom is absolute no because it's electron and I am not running electron on my laptop if there is alternative
It's on github, probably free game. But yeah prob best to ask OP
It's good advice to avoid asking knowledge questions in an interview; ask questions that show whether people have transferrable experience, motivation and teamworking skills. For example, a candidate doesn't need to know what PEP8 is to contribute to a Python team - that's what linters are for.
How does it handle C extensions?
No love for the new (ish) super() syntax? Straight up feels like cheating every time I do it.
What? Jupyter is Interactive environment, PyCharm is full fledged IDE no comparisons between these two. You shouldn't run a dev project in jupyter. ML/DS project sure by all means run if in jupyter but not the Dev project
Sure! Greatly appreciated!
&gt;I don’t think you’ve ever worked on a larger project There are many great programmers who have said on record they don't use debuggers like Linus Torvalds, Ken Thompson, Brian Kernighan etc. Even Guido only uses pdb and mostly prefers to use `print()`. And all of them have worked on fairly "large" projects. I think debugging is a complex problem and requires multiple tools. Stepping through line by line as done by pdb and other IDE debuggers is certainly necessary for many cases but that does NOT replace logging/error and a proper understanding of the code which the original commenter mentioned. Also there are recorded errors in many programming languages where stepping through the error using a debugger actually hides the error you get on a normal run.
As a person using both VS Code and PyCharm: PyCharm delivers a pretty flawless experience with great debugging capabilities and superior code completion out of the box. The time you save is work the money for most people imho. I'm still more of a VS Code person because I mostly live in the terminal and generally don't like huge IDEs doing way too magic. Still, I can appreciate the good things in PyCharm.
Emacs isn't just an editor, it's a way of life. IDE features: https://github.com/jorgenschaefer/elpy git integration: https://magit.vc/ directory view: https://github.com/Alexander-Miller/treemacs anaconda integration: https://github.com/proofit404/anaconda-mode Not to mention everything else you can do in emacs for editing (multiple cursors, project-wide find/replace, registers, macros, regex etc) iirc PyCharm provides most of these (not registers or multiple cursors afaik) but often requires messing around with GUIs. I also used [org-mode](https://orgmode.org) to keep track of basically everything, which is a phenomenal organizational tool.
I haven't seen it posted in this thread yet, but if you're a student, you actually can get the professional version for free from them. It's incredibly worth it if you do a lot of python coding for your degree.
Its literally the only software I pay for. (That and WinRAR)
&gt;but the remote sync over ssh was a godsend debugging AWS deployment issues. Have you considered a Windows clone of SSHFS? There's even an open-source one : https://github.com/feo-cz/win-sshfs
Just try it and see what it does!
Ever since I saw this post I've wanted to duplicate it in PySimpleGUI to see what it's like. I learn something new every time. It's hard to find example programs that can be quickly rewritten. This dice rolling thing is an excellent example of something that can be more or less duplicated. I didn't get the controls centered on the window. It's possible to do but would have taken a bit of work. The biggest difference between tkiner and PySimpleGUI is the amount of code needed. I stripped all of the comments from the posted program and the # lines of code came out to be. Since it's such a small program to begin with, it's hard to squeeze very much. Still, I managed to get a roughly 25% reduction in lines of code. 43 - tkinter based version 31 - PySimpleGUI version Here is the PySimpleGUI version of stuff.... [https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13696193/60057075-3a1f0500-96b1-11e9-8ae7-91ae1730ad86.png](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13696193/60057075-3a1f0500-96b1-11e9-8ae7-91ae1730ad86.png) And here's the code: import PySimpleGUI as sg from random import randint window, previous_total, dice, total = None, -1, [] , 0 while True: #Main Dice Rolling Loop layout = [[sg.Column([dice])], [sg.Text('Number of Dice:')], [sg.In(size=(3,1), key='_NUM_DICE_')], [sg.Button('Roll Dice', bind_return_key=True)], [sg.Text('Total:', font='ANY 20', text_color='red')], [sg.Text(' ',size=(3,1), key='_TOTAL_', font='ANY 20', text_color = 'red')],] if previous_total != total: window.Close() if window is not None else None window = sg.Window('Dice Roller', layout).Finalize() window.Element('_TOTAL_').Update(total) while True: # Loop to read # dice to roll, create list of images event, values = window.Read() if event is None: exit() try: num_dice = int(values['_NUM_DICE_']) except: continue if 8 &lt; num_dice &lt; 0: continue previouis_dice = dice dice, total = [], 0 for i in range(num_dice): # for each die rolled, get the random # and build list of images die = randint(1,6) dice += [sg.Image(filename=r'./images/die{}_1.png'.format(die), size=(250,250))] total += die break
It does not currently, according to the docs. There’s a plan but it’s not ready yet.
Which is why writing your comparisons as if the compiler/interpreter is an asshole-genie who will screw you over on ambiguity is a generally good rule of thumb.
Generators are *so fucking good*
What does this syntax do?
Hi guys, I've been working a this [Dict Querer](https://github.com/josuebrunel/MySDQ). Nothing crazy fancy here, just a lil useful tool you can use from time to time when you need query a json data. Thanks for your feedbacks
pdb++ and pudb are nice alternatives
No. vscode or VIM.
Holy shit dude. This was the last thing I expected from this post but you did a nice job
Woah ! Wait a second, this was built with Rust, that's really awesome to see!
I tried to tame PyCharm linting and auto formatting, but it never satisfied me. We have a lot of different tools for such tasks that just works per repository with its own configuration files. In some projects I want to use black or autopep8. VS Code just work fine with other tools, and don’t needs its own. Never have any problems with autocomplete, I wander what it should be if it can be any better to notice. I’ve updated to new beta engine, also provided by MS. Maybe default is not good enough. PyCharm multi cursors never worked for me. May be they also needed to be configured, but I already have fingers memory from SublimeText. As result I payed for PyCharm and after few months when I’ve switched to VS Code it was like a fresh air. Have run it for debugging several times (its interface was more similar). VS Code tests detection is clever and nice. Commit interface in PyCharm is ugly vs simple and just working in VS Code. Every new file format is just detected and pop-up offer to download plugin. Very beautiful markdown preview plugin support everything including LaTeX formulas and code highlight, PyCharm support for such things is not any good. PyCharm still need you to open site to download update! Rly in 2019 you need separated tool that eating 200Mb of RAM just to download updates and lunch editor? I love how easily you can work with terminal in VS Code and many other things. You have your point, I can agree that you love PyCharm, but VS Code is great piece of software that have its own shining parts.
/r/learnpython &amp;#x200B; Format your code properly. &amp;#x200B; Look up defaultdicts, in collections.
If you're never writing anything more than a single disposable script, and you load your notebook up with a whole bunch of extensions, maybe. Jupyter notebooks are a great way to present code to other people, but they don't excel at development.
It is, my dude/dudet. It is.
Your process hangs problem is easily solvable by changing your [client.py](https://client.py) file, line 75 to be: self.client_thread = Thread(target=self.receive_message, daemon=True) Use the same keyword parameter on your Thread call in the [server.py](https://server.py) file, lines 49, 98 , set \`daemon=True\` Basically without setting these Threads as daemons, then they will not allow the program to exit if in a blocking call. Setting this parameter takes away that restriction.
We also give access in cells to some of the code intelligence (autocomplete, fixes, refactoring, navigation, etc.)

I could, but reading the docs gives more complete knowledge.
This made my Django projects look a lot less ugly, thankful for this.

Two things: A dark IDLE theme: [https://github.com/Randomness74/Dark-IDLE-Theme](https://github.com/Randomness74/Dark-IDLE-Theme) A command-line distance calculator: [https://github.com/Randomness74/Distance-Calculator](https://github.com/Randomness74/Distance-Calculator)
Yes
Reading tutorials at Sololearn and Tutorialspoint is a good way to start.
It's PEP 572 (assignment expressions), only available from python 3.8 onwards. Basically "assign to m and evaluate for the clause at the same time." Heavily debated by the community because of the confusion it can potentially create. I myself would prefer a different syntax, but overall I can't wait, it will make the code more laconic and still keep it readable
I personally have not found any problem with the spell check
Short Answer: yep
Im a vscode user and yes once it hit the approved list i was ecstatic!
I think perhaps it can be disabled?

I was code golfing once for shits and grins and wrote fizzbuzz in a single (albeit stupid long) line of code that used a list comprehension and modular arithmetic to spit out the whole thing. It was horrific and obfuscatory - the exact opposite of what a list comprehension is for, but it is basically the coolest feature in Python as far as I'm concerned.
Let me be very clear on what I object to: you were making an absolute statement ("Pandas has no place whatsoever in persistent services or a production pipeline"). Like I said, I don't doubt that pandas hasn't worked in your environment, but I don't find your post to provide enough evidence that it has "no place whatsoever", and I'd certainly be interested in seeing examples that illustrate your point. &gt; You just can’t put it in a production pipeline, even if they are doing it intelligently, because the time it takes to simply create/load a Pandas DF is longer than it takes to do the entire processing step with a native data structure. &gt; in the time it takes to load even a 100 MB file I can be done with the entire processing step if I use native data structures This is a specific complaint which you omitted in your original post. Is your data being input from a structured tabular serialized format (CSVs, HDF5, Parquet, etc)? How slow is "unbearably slow" here, would you consider 2 seconds to be unbearably slow for a 100MB file (including disk I/O)? That's around the time I see loading a pandas DataFrame from some random 100MB file dataset I have. I'm well aware that for example the [BlockManager makes it difficult to do zero-copy construction of DataFrames from numpy arrays](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/9216) and its one of my several pain points with using pandas. If this is your objection to using pandas, I can certainly empathize (I'm personally of the opinion that the community support is valuable enough for pandas, although I wouldn't be prepared to change to another library yet). Maybe we can do something simple and concrete to compare. Let's create a collection of 1 million random integers between 0 to 100, and return the count of how many times each integer appears. Obviously this is contrived but its a common task to get counts of identifiers. What kind of performance can you get for this using python built-in data structures?
remote interpreter is a big one
I briefly skimmed the preface and it seems like the book hasn’t been updated for 3.6+ ? I don’t think it’s a deal breaker I’m wondering if there’s anything I’m missing out on. The reason i bring it up is because I had a similar experience recently with learning React with just class based components and then I had to relearn everything with Hooks and Context. I’d rather find a comprehensive resource from the start
My issue with the spell check was it trying to spell check variable and method names. I’ll leave it on for comments, but that’s all I’ll leave it on for.
Check the environment variables you're running in the subprocess command. It could be that the PATH or some other environment variables relied upon aren't being passed in, you need to explicitly set the environment variables.
What is the new(ish) syntax? I'm assuming you don't mean super() itself...
I had a hard time adjusting to python as my previous programming was R and Java, so the whitespace thing annoyed me. Now I hate having to type curly brackets.
Is that syntactic sugar or is it actually a feature? My impression is that they are faster too (compared to writing a loop and building a new list) since they are optimized.
Well, I thought so too, but it seems to work for some domains and gives this error for others. so it gives me this error for [hackerone.com](https://hackerone.com) subdomains, however, it works perfectly for other domains.
&gt;How slow is "unbearably slow" here, would you consider 2 seconds to be unbearably slow for a 100MB file (including disk I/O)? That's around the time I see loading a pandas DataFrame from some random 100MB file dataset I have. Absolutely 2 seconds is too slow for a persistent service or production pipeline when all it takes is very little extra work to get a huge speedup. Unless you absolutely have to have a Pandas DF for whatever reason, it's worth it to spend the extra time writing a few extra lines of code for something that will save a huge amount of time over an extended period. Starting with Pandas also pigeonholes you into using Pandas functions (also often much slower than native data structures or Numpy) or converting to a different data structure, again more overhead. &gt;Maybe we can do something simple and concrete to compare. Let's create a collection of 1 million random integers between 0 to 100, and return the count of how many times each integer appears. Obviously this is contrived but its a common task to get counts of identifiers. What kind of performance can you get for this using python built-in data structures? I'll have to give try this, I have benchmarked vaguely similar tasks and found that again, the overhead of making a Pandas DF just kills the viability of using Pandas. I will try this specifically out when I get some time and see how it works out with Pandas vs Numpy vs lists. Basically, in my limited experience, I have never found case where using Pandas was faster or more memory efficient than native data structures or Numpy, but I don't doubt that there are cases where it is faster or more memory efficient. Using Pandas certainly is easier, though, in a lot of cases. In a lot of these cases, refactoring code that uses Pandas, I am having to do a lot of work to achieve the same outcome. Believe me, I would love to be using Pandas all the time, it's intuitive and easy. I've just done a lot of benchmarking though and it hasn't been any contest. Also, it's completely unviable using tens of gigabytes of data.
Would you be so kind to outline the instrumentation you have in place to perform a post mortem debugging session?
It took an hour to write a function that could be replaced by a list comprehension?
That makes sense and I can see why that would be bad. In my case, I've been able to get along fine with spelled out names for most function, variable, and class names. Maybe that's only because my project is just a hobby and/or I'm pretty new to programming.
Also you can absolutely count 1 million random integers between 0 and 100 in O(n) using native data structures and iterating thru a list once, so I’m not sure how Pandas could possibly be faster here. But again, I will test it out
Why not use 7-zip?
My first time I saw one, I went "WHAT THE HECK IS THAT". &amp;#x200B; Now that I understand, I find myself missing them in every other language.
I think it's been changed now to "Q: How can I swap the values of two variables in Python?" - which is: [a,b] = [b,a] I think.
Get the Material Design theme / extension. It looks great.
Functions that take in iterables as inputs the using map. list(map(func, list of lists)) So clean, especially when mixed with some basic classes.
Org-mode is addictive!
I don't know whether to be more horrified at the thought that it took the pair of you a whole hour to write a function simple enough for a list comprehension, or that you crammed something so complicated that it took an hour to write into a single list comprehension.
I highly recommend Corey Schafer's set up videos [windows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nh9rCzPJ20) &amp; [mac](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06I63_p-2A4). They were a great first step to using VS Code w/ Python.
WinRAR has more character
&gt; Just try it and see what it does! It does is kill the REPL's special `_` "last result" builtin: py&gt; 3+5 8 py&gt; _ + 2 10 py&gt; first, second, *_, last = range(20) py&gt; 3+5 8 py&gt; _ + 2 Traceback (most recent call last): File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt; TypeError: can only concatenate list (not "int") to list There's also a long-running convention to use `_` for localisation. All things considered, it's probably better to use `__` (double underscore) instead. cc u/FlagrantPickle
Eh, it's still a little wonky IMO. If you do a lot of python stuff, it might be worth getting pycharm. The settings menus and such being geared toward that is kinda nice.
In Python 2, you have to specify the class and instance explicitly: class ThisClass(object): def spam(self, arg): x = super(ThisClass, self).spam(arg) process(x) Some people write this as `super(type(self), self).spam(arg)` and have buggy code. So in Python 3, `super` was enhanced to take no arguments, so that you can write `super().spam(arg)` and it will automatically do the right thing inside a class.
The fact that the condition is in the middle rubs me the wrong way. I usually either avoid it completely or write `x = condition and something or otherthing` and make code reviewers angry.
You are evil. I like you.
Isn't it just the same as putting an if statement before one?

I'm not a huge fan of Jupyter unless I'm going to be running the same expensive thing over and over. But, I definitely don't use it in pycharm. As many other selling points as there are for pycharm, I don't feel that's one.
VSCode is also Electron FYI, just way more optimized than Atom.
Read the side bar for how to format your code. Then read [this](http://sscce.org/) so you can ask better quality questions and get better quality answers. It is written for Java programmers but it applies to any language, including Python. Then decide what your *actual* question is. "How do I..." and "I'm getting this error and I don't understand it..." type questions will usually get better responses than "Need help." statements. Good luck.
VS Code all the way.
What does 1 mean when host returns it? Maybe there's a simple explanation like the domain is down at the time and you've just been unlucky. Try capturing stderr and stdout and see if there's anything there. Maybe host is printing useful messages and you're not seeing them. Are you running both the Python and bash commands as the same user account on the same machine?

I'm trying to connect to the free amazon product api in order to get my cousin some pricing data before he launches his new hot sauce company. No luck so far.
This is my #1 by far. Tons of error handling and exit conditions? Wrap the function in a context manager decorator and voilà, back to readable code.
Exactly that, yes. https://www.jetbrains.com/student/
&gt;You guys who use PyCharm, don't you find the UI is ugly? No?
Yea atm I find my workflow split in half between pycharm and Jupyter
It's really easy to just say "add this word to the project dictionary" though.

Jetbrains dealt with this erector set approach to an IDE a while back (using Vim in the example): https://blog.jetbrains.com/pycharm/2013/06/vim-as-a-python-ide-or-python-ide-as-vim/ &gt;With Python, there is a real need to get rid of routine tasks and use &gt;supplementary tools like code inspections, error highlighting on the fly, &gt;dependency checks, quick-fixes, refactorings, a debugger, frameworks &gt;support, testing assistance, Version control, search and navigation, &gt;project management, remote development assistance, PEP-8 &gt;compliance checks... And all these features must work &gt;together in a reliable, efficient and robust fashion. &gt; &gt;That’s what IDEs are designed for. They provide the necessary level of &gt;efficiency and comfort for using many tools and features in one place. &gt; &gt;For better or worse, Vim is not an IDE. Sure, it is customizable and &gt;supports many things, with lots of plugins and add-ons and other bells &gt;and whistles. Yet it’s really far off from being a real IDE.
Yeah, but between abbreviations and other forms of short hand to keep lines from getting to long, I’d rather just turn the spell check off for variable and method names anyway. It’s even worse when I open up scripts from old employees and get lambasted with every strName_first and intDOB_mili that they used. I just turned it off for everything not a comment globally and life is so much better.
I pretty much never use that stuff tho. Logging and quickly moving between files and methods is all I need. To that end, I suggest spacemacs. But use whatever u feel comfortable with.
Th debugger is so good. Decent profiling and thread/concurrency analyzer, too!
Agreed, being able to easily define my own with `@contextlib.contextmanager` is icing on the cake.
Depends on how u debug tbh. If your the kind of developers that makes heavy use of breakpoints, introspection etc. then it’ll take a little while to get used to. If your the kind that prefers to implement proper logging and follow the code by first understanding how it’s flowing then emacs/vim are great. Emacs gives extensibility and control that VSCode can only dream of. Vim gives a modal editor which once u get used to, will make editing a relative breeze.
I like vscode as well, but I find the interactive mode unusable with the two columns, I would much rather have the code below the cell like in notebooks. Do you know if there is a setting for it?
What’s your error
/r/learnpython
Thanks, another TIL there.
In my understanding, the author works (worked?) on mercurial, which is becoming a rust/python hybrid. So it makes sense!
Font smoothing on JetBrains IDEs under Windows is still subpar. And it’s not just a Windows thing, you can compete VSCode and JetBrains with identical font settings, it’s clear as day. That said, I still love the IDEs and I use Linux (elementaryOS 5.0).
while True:
Fair point, I didn’t do enough research of my own into this. Thanks for the info
I was using pycharm and switched to IDEA. You are right pycharm is more friendly when it comes to developing python related projects. However most of the time my project also include other components like nodejs and the like. Pycharm can handle these up to a certain degree but IDEA is way much better. So depends really on OP's uss case
From a certain point of view, the entire language is just syntactic sugar over ASM.
I think most of the paid functionality are geared towards webdev. The free one was more than enough for my coding at work in VFX.
Need .edu email.
You might have to 'r' the other components such as \\Report or escape the \\ character in the string as it is probably tripping over that. I am always fighting with file paths for this type of thing. Create your path name first, then print to check it looks right, before passing it to read\_excel.
What do you mean my something more high-level? I don't know much about PDEs so I can't speak mucb about that. But scipy has numerical solvers for ODEs. https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/integrate.html Scipy also have functions for minimizing or maximizing optimum functions. https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/optimize.html If you're familiar with C++ you want to write your own code for your fluid dynamics simulation, you should check out Cython. It's a C extension for Python. In theory, properly written code in Cython will be a lot faster than regular Python code. https://cython.org/
&gt; As a beginner Doesn't look so beginner to me, nice work! How much time have you spent on it if you don't mind me asking?
How does that kill it? Looks like it just got set to a list of multiple elements, which is exactly what I would expect.
What’s wrong with Electron?
[Astropy](https://www.astropy.org/) has often been held up as an example of a good scientific Python package - I've never used it, but I've heard great things. [PlasmaPy](https://www.plasmapy.org/) is a very, very early project (I was at the APS-DPP meeting where it was being proposed a few years ago) to emulate Astropy but for plasma physics instead of astronomy. If you're interested in slightly different use-cases, the [AToM SciDAC](https://scidac.github.io/atom/) project built the Integrated Plasma Simulator (IPS) a Python-driven HPC framework for integrated modeling for fusion.
Is this different to sugar = [func(elem) for elem in list_of_lists]
There's a special `_` added to the builtins namespace when you start the REPL. (I don't think it exists when you're just running a script, but I haven't tried it.) If you create a global variable called `_` in the REPL, it shadows the special one. Carrying on from my earlier session: py&gt; import builtins py&gt; 8+2 10 py&gt; builtins._ 10 py&gt; _ [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18] So deleting the global `_` gives you access to the magic `_` again.
Err... how does this differ from numpy.linalg?
I wasn’t sure how to find that, thanks!
We wrote a protobuf -&gt; json response converter using basically only dict comprehension and recursion, was great.
Instead of this: `x = a if a is not None else b` ...being able to write this: `x = a or b` Beautifully simple.
Holy shit are you serious? How did I miss this from the patch notes? This is great. Although I had it down at this point, it's just annoying to write.
post a github link, most people wont download the code without looking at it first.
How in the heck can this guy write thousands of words about his brand new project without even a tiny acknowledgement of the *multiple*, *mature*, *well-supported* projects that have ***already solved the same fucking problem***? For reference, * [PyInstaller](https://www.pyinstaller.org) "freezes (packages) Python applications into stand-alone executables, under Windows, GNU/Linux, Mac OS X, FreeBSD, Solaris and AIX." * [cx_freeze](https://cx-freeze.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) "set of scripts and modules for freezing Python scripts into executables... should work on any platform that Python itself works on" * [py2exe](http://www.py2exe.org) "converts Python scripts into executable Windows program" * [py2app](https://py2app.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) "is a Python setuptools command which will allow you to make standalone application bundles and plugins from Python scripts." The problem described at such length *has been solved* and while this new solution may do the job better, or differently, it is quite... disappointing... that the developer apparently never even looked at the existing work.
So it does become the expected list, but it also overrides the built-in in a possibly unexpected way.
that’s how i would debug matlab code, lmaooo
Check out the community edition of pycharm if you are looking for an IDE (it's not necessary, but some people prefer working in IDEs) Maybe check out AdventOfCode if you want some good practice problems with escalating difficulty.
Sorry, what is IDE?
/r/learnprogramming also, "HELP PLZ!" is fairly obnoxious. i cant speak for everyone, but it made me not want to help you
Pycharm is not worth it. VsCode provides everything and more elegantly, without too much complication. Python debugging, integrated terminal plus the excellent editor are all great Vscode features
Hey, I can get a free year of Pycharm for you if you want. PM me.
Just for fun, try wrapping that in a `bash -c "my bash commands go here"` It maybe that your shell -- probably already `bash` -- does some extra magic which `subprocess` does not.
Just get VS Code
It's the same as `1 &lt; x and x &lt; 10`.
PyIntaller and cx_freeze both handle PyQt apps.
IDE is like a cool place to write code. With nifty features like autocomplete on common words and hints that you might have mispelled your variable name. If you aren't used to using one I wouldn't start there because it's a bunch of extra stuff to learn on top of the new language.
Pyinstaller works for all of those. Yes, you need to build it on all platforms, just like any binary. You said compile; that’s what that means.
Clear your environment and just use pip if you don't need all the anaconda stuff. Baby steps.
Being pure-python rather than a thin wrapper around BLAS/LAPACK.
Huh, sounds like something having to do with the command being ran in the wrong directory. If you swap it out with `ls`, is the output expected?
Same thing if you are using headless nodes like Raspberrys (or really any remote deployment), the remote sync, deploy, run, and debug over SSH is such a time saver compared to juggling multiple terminals over git.
Those look interesting - thank you!

Do the domains exist? host returns 1 on an NXDOMAIN, your bash script handles this just fine because it doesn't bother to check, but python sees a non-zero return value as an error.
No
The blog post is mostly about problems with image recognition. This is why when I write bots for games for actual use I pull coordinates directly from memory whenever possible.
Nice, thank you.
I agree. If you are just playing around with some learning, the Python plugin in IntelliJ IDEA should be fine. If you are doing exclusive Python development for 8 hours a day, the streamlined PyCharm experience is worth it.
And 300% more RAR
`setup.py` isn't a new thing at all - `pyproject.toml` and `Pipfile` are newer potential replacements for it, supported by tools like Poetry (`pyproject.toml`) and Pipenv (`Pipfile`). Read the documentation for those to figure out why it's a good thing.
From my experience it's significantly faster. I'm pretty sure that map under the hood is written with parallelism in mind whereas a list comprehension executes serially.
From memory? Meaning via Numpy? &amp;#x200B; True, there is a component of image recognition involved. However, it was written in Python.
Fair enough. I just appreciate the `a or b` assignment syntax.

Yes but does vscode have ipython integration in debugging mode? Or debugging nested python processes?
I use Pycharm for python projects and VSCode/Vim for everything else.
If I had to choose between vscode and soydery I'd probably go with vscode too. I prefer pycharm, though.
To be fair, I feel like most people who would try to use sudo don't understand file and directory permissions as much as they probably should. I can't think of a time I would ever try to pip install with sudo...
Note that I do development for a living, so my experience may be overkill. I use several of the JetBrains IDEs at work, Pycharm included. It’s 100% worth it IMO, I don’t think I could be nearly as efficient at my job without it. The same goes for Webstorm, Datagrip, and IDEA (using the Scala plugin). Tight database integration, extremely fast code inspection, excellent Cython support, profiling and debugging tools, remote interpreter support, Vagrant integration. All that makes my life so much easier.
&gt; noticeable limitations of functionality If you don't need profiling and unit test coverage and stuff like that.
&gt;How does this differ from numpy.linalg? I wondered the same. Apparently the author thought numpy was too fast.
Oh, I didn't consider that, that might be the reason, as it works fine for some domains and not for others.
yes, everything else, including the environment is exactly the same. i think maybe just python and the host command are handling unavailable domains differently.
I think, that's not the case, as I have been able to make it work for some domains but it gives an error for some.
yup, that works, even works for other domains.
It doesn't, functionality wise. In fact, it's slower. Calculating a determinant for a randomized 5x5 matrix takes 118us in numpy as 211us in linalg. For 100x100, it takes 7.96ms vs 58.2ms. This is meant to be 100% python3 without an underlying C/Fortran library. Granted, that doesn't really have much merit considering how much of python is already wrapped C. However, I do think it does make it easier for someone to use it for say, checking if their homework calculations are correct. Also, people can actually see the underlying algorithm(which are pretty bad right now numerical stability-wise) and add new functionality without having to dive into a hundred header files. And performance can be improved with pypy.
Because comparatively electron is a big memory hogger. Something like sublime text is great if you talk about the performance but it's not feature complete. I had memory hogging issues with many electron apps so not my first choice now
No, any university email will do.
Wat... also a lot of those photos are not even cheesecakes! I saw smoothies and cookies in there as well. One star.
It used to be necessary in some cases before we had Python wheels and when Ubuntu 14.04 shipped with a broken pip and virtualenv. Say you were trying to install a difficult package like numpy and you just wanted the Ubuntu version, and then you want to install a pure Python package that used it. And let's say this is a Docker container so we're not too concerned about breaking the system Python because it's sufficient for our app to work.
I had a similar project, reading through a big customer service gmail account checking for keywords in the emails. At the end of the day I made a summary of different trends of customer complaints (faulty products, shipping problems, etc.). I had a lot of problems with the gmail api and eventually found that on Outlook you can actually export all your emails to a CSV file, which made my job super easy. One thing to note is that although it has all the obvious information (subject, sender, body, etc.) It does not include the time stamp, which is a major downside. The other downside is that you can't automatically export or update the emails via python that I'm aware of, you have to export it manually. Good luck on your project!
Yes, absolutely. Intellij is kinda so, so...Netbeans in many cases is better, but if you have to do anything serious with Python, then you will quickly find out how amazing PyCharm is and what it can do for you.
I recently wrote a program that pulls products from the Walmart api. It takes all the important information they use (price, descriptions, and a million other things) and spits it out into a csv file. Of course, Walmart doesnt have nearly as many products as Amazon does but I'm sure they have a handful of hot sauces. Would you like me to share some of my code?
I don’t have any references to recommend, but so just want to remind you of the time-worn advice against premature optimization. Your code will be the most maintainable and usable if you write the functionality in a straightforward way, then profile it and find the bottlenecks, then optimize those. Measure before optimizing!
Yes! I use http.server _all the time_ for testing http clients / apps, etc.
You can even debug code running in a Python interpreter inside a Docker image. It's awesome.
Thanks friend. In this project they use Thunderbird, which used to have a bulk export tool, which was discontinued.. so I’ve used the gmail api, and it hasn’t been too bad. Their invoices are also contained in forms, which have to be downloaded, and have the forms scraped. It has been an interesting flow to create.
Yes. Although I hate the new subscription mechanism they introduced. I'm currently not working so I can't shell out for a subscription so I have to use an older copy.

r/ITCareerQuestions
Entirely fair. Thanks for the reply. I didn't intend my message to be overly critical. I don't think that it's necessarily bad to have a variety of packages for a common task. And I certainly support the "my first attempt at a real open-source community package that somebody else might actually use" type of project. But the other post set off a yellow flag: "I'm going to teach this to my students" - for a few reasons. First: Students are a very delicate test case. They're learning so many things at once - Python syntax, the standard Python library, how to program, the requirements of the assignment, and a particular educational topic (like linear algebra!) - and something going wrong in any one of those things might cost them a day or a week of supremely frustrating, head-banging-on-desk trouble. The last thing they need is a requirement to complete the assignment with a *brand-new, untested* library. Imagine all of the tricky problems that this could create: deployment issues, version incompatibilities with Python distros or other packages, random errors or exceptions that might be difficult to trace or debug... Those kinds of headaches can be reduced by confining assignments to well-established packages... like numpy. Second: I really loathe the notion (which is common in academia, particularly CS) that students should be introduced using pedagogical languages and toolkits. They might spend six months or a year getting acclimated to a particular package and environment - and in their next class, or even their internship, they're suddenly confronted with *industry-standard tools* that they don't know at all. Students who learn this package won't know numpy... in fact, they won't see any point, since numpy will appear to be redundant with what they know. When they finally hit the wall and are forced to learn and use numpy, it will take them a while to translate and adapt. Some of their old code might not even be portable. This is a big handicap, especially compared with other universities that adopt standardized technology.
Pycharm was free for me...
I'm not a native English speaker, yes. But it's not a good excuse for me anyway. If you can help me out to correct grammar I will really appreciate it.
Oh man. The @property decorator. And the accompanying .setter ... SO incredible.
It's not a far jump for those dipping their toes in the Linux desktop space. "pip and apt are both package managers, apt doesn't work if I don't sudo but does if I does if I do, maybe I should sudo pip!" Without knowing it is equivalent to code execution, the lack of curation on PyPI, or being told it's bad, I've known a lot of people who have made the mistake.
Absolutely. Especially when you get an error like "you don't have permission" or whatnot. I think a lot of newbies think sudo is just "I really want to do this!", a sort of a sanity check, and don't realize they're actually acting as a different user
Yes it is very useful and simple.
OP didn't write the full title which says "and other desserts" after cheesecake
Link: http://sim.me.uk/cheesecake/
Alright thx
Ah. I assumed /u/rdguez already knows about numpy/scipy, and was looking for something simple to show students how gaussian elimination/etc can be translated into code. Anyway, I definitely agree. This is just my first package, and it does not have the computational rigidity or the industry standard position that numpy has.
Like I wasn't fat enough
I made a simple application of Q-Learning on the Snake game. This was done using python and pyglet.
Yeah, that. If you’re paying with your own money, **don’t** spend extra on PyCharm if you’re already paying for IDEA Ultimate. Yes, PyCharm is a little slicker and less cluttered than IDEA+plugin if you’re doing mainly Python development, but if you’re already used to the way that IDEA works you’ll be fine. There’s literally *no reason* to spend a substantial amount of additional money on PyCharm as well — its feature set is kept in sync with that of the Python plugin for IDEA. On the other hand, if (say) your company is footing the bill, what the heck, go for it! My employer pays for the all products pack, and I use both IDEA Ultimate and PyCharm (and CLion) on a daily basis. If you have access to both anyway, the tiny bit of reduced friction makes using PyCharm worth it for Python-based projects.
I like the idea of cheesecakes - it is really cool. This book may be interesting to read for juniors I think. But: 1. The style guide should be short so developers will read it frequently. Here there are a lot of useless pictures that doesn't describe anything 2. It to verbose for me, you write pros, cons, decision. You need to highlight important things, like: **use the whitespaces instead of tabs for god's sake,** you know
i dont want to download unknown files from an unknown user
"and other desserts"
2 player dice game lmao
I thought this reply would come. There’s some “dramatic effect” in the above comment. The function sorted some data and then acted on. We replaced the sorting part with a list comprehension. Still amazed me though
I used Pyinstaller, but had issues with it sometimes (the exe didn't worked as expected or at all, missed to include some modules, big size). So I made little script https://pypi.org/project/pyvan/ which just takes the embeded Python version, installs all the modules needed and creates a .bat file which links the python.exe with the entry_point.py in order to be executed. If something goes wrong I just go in the dist folder and solve the issue more easily since there it's just python. Where Pyinstaller didn't worked pyvan did in my case. I'll checkout pyoxidizer, but I don't know if it will work for Pandas..

Debugging is something so many people never learn to do. Once you do learn, you can get so much insight into your code. About a year ago somebody ask me for help with a bug that they just couldn't figure out. I started the debugger, stepped through the program and in five minutes figured out what they had been stuck on for two days. Profiling is an absolute must when you have weird slowness too. So many people spend a ton of time optimising their code and only getting minimal speed ups because what they think is the source of the slow is not. So whilst you never use that, I highly recommend you try learn a bit about it. It will make you a far better programmer. In addition, to a lot of people, the way the profiler and debugger works and is integrated is the make or break for an IDE.
Hows my Test
yup pretty much. but its much cleaner not having to type it explicitly
I have no clue, does it?
@property: I just consider it a field that has a custom getter and/or setter. Pretty straightforward. @staticmethod: For functions that are conceptually associated with the class, but can be used in contexts that don't necessarily involve the class or an object of the class directly. Sort of like a way to organize a utility function. @classmethod: For when I want to modify or get info about the class, usually it's just about a class variable. Useful, for example, if your objects all share some value that is stored in the class instead of the separate objects.
Y U NO KINDLE?
&gt; I sort of wish f-strings were the default behaviour, because I like the functionality. Me too. Designing and implementing programming languages is a hobby of mine, and for those I generally make f-style strings the default, and don't provide a way to do explicit concatenation outside of `"{foo}{bar}"`. For concatenation more advanced than that, I prefer writing generators and joining them, like `''.join(do for x in bleep() do yield bloop(x) end end)`.
Yet Debian's pip still does not default to a home install
He means inspecting the memory of the application you're botting.
Whats the difference between a property and classmethod? They seem so similar
Just starting out with Anaconda. In Spyder, when Graphics Backend are changed to Automatic. I get the **RuntimeError: Cannot activate multiple GUI eventloops** does anyone have any ideas how to address it?
Can you explain why I shouldn't use tabs?
PyCharm Community Edition is free and has most features.
#`property` I almost exclusively use this for alternative ways to access data. An example from a game I'm working on: @dataclass(eq=False) class Unit(Actor): pos: Pos orientation: Orientation # ... @property def state(self) -&gt; UnitState: return UnitState(self.pos, self.orientation) @state.setter def state(self, value: UnitState) -&gt; None: self.pos = value.pos self.orientation = value.orientation Most of the code accesses `unit.pos` or `unit.orientation`, but for pathfinding it's convenient to have them bundled together and use `unit.state`. Note that the conversion should be very cheap, you don't want the interpreter to freeze up for a property access. #`staticmethod` I use this for functions that don't reference the class at all, that could be free functions but logically is part of the responsibility of a specific class. #`classmethod` 9/10 times I use this, it's for alternative constructors. (Like `bytes.fromhex` or `int.from_bytes`.)
Is it a Binary Tree or a Binary Search Tree (BST)? Two different things. The latter is sorted while the former isn't. To find the minimum value in a BST you just need to find the leftmost node by recursively visit the left subtree of the current node (see [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-the-minimum-element-in-a-binary-search-tree/)). To find the minimum value in a Binary Tree you can use any graph traversal algorithm (e.g., DFS, BFS) to find the node with minimum value (see [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-maximum-or-minimum-in-binary-tree/)).
Well, they're not similar at all. A property acts just like a field (an object attribute) from the outside, however, you can specify custom behaviors for when that field is retrieved or changed. These are specific to objects and not classes, so each object will use its own values when working with a property. A classmethod is pretty much the same as a normal method, except that instead of automatically being passed a created object as the first parameter, it gets passed a class. No extra behavior happens here unless you write the code for it.
I was like you for many years, then on a whim tried PyCharm, then switched to Professional then I started wondering why did I hurt myself the way you describe for all those years. With PyCharm I can focus on what's important.
Before PyCharm I was like u/Mohkale77, not anymore. It is much easier that way, and seeing your variables evolve in real time is fun!
I see what you did there, Richard
Is there a script to load get.friendship from a CSV file? Looking to have it follow a low number of people periodically, picking up where it left off last.
The short answer for believers: because [PEP-8](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#tabs-or-spaces) and [google style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html) tells us to use spaces. Also should be mentioned: [https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/06/15/developers-use-spaces-make-money-use-tabs/](https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/06/15/developers-use-spaces-make-money-use-tabs/) But yeah, it's an old holy war: tabs vs spaces.

I have that too
it's buggy af. I mean you're running whole browser with all of the cruft and bloat your program never uses. It's super prone to memory leaking and in general is a mess when it comes to resources. I have 16gb of ram gen 6 i7 and I need to restart every electron app once in a while unless it's a very basic one.
If you have a good amount of tests it's really easy to debug stuff. You just point where it doesn't work. click near the line number to put a break point. Run the tests as debug. Step over + Step into until you find something interesting. You can also evaluate some expression to run/do/check things that are not in your code.
Debugging in Pycharm is very awkward though. I think majority of people prefer proper terminal tools like ipdb etc.
For me IdeaVim plugin is a killer feature. I love vim and pycharm offers super autocomplete/inspection so it's a matchmade in heaven. That being said if ideavim would become first class citizen (support buffers, vim plugins etc) - then it would be trully perfect. I do miss some vim plugins and proper buffer support :(
Documentation is good :) [https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/debugging-code.html](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/debugging-code.html)
Thanks. Now I'm hungry.
Not OP, but autocomplete is one of the most important features of any IDE and turning it off is just too much. I used VSCode for python about a year ago, autocomplete was worse than in PyCharm - it had troubles guessing anything other than built-ins. It might have gotten better since then, idk.

Good job on finishing the book. It definitely required a lot of work. The idea is cute. The images are nice. The content is questionable at best, opinionated and gives little reasoning for the advice it provides. It also offers no advantage over existing style guides which are widely used in the community. I firmly believe that in a language that is so dependent on consistent styling we don't need another [standard](https://xkcd.com/927/). You somehow managed to do wrong here in three ways: * by being imprecise when precision is required * by fitting the existing, agreed upon by the community, standards - why then is your work necesssary? * by deviating from the existing, agreed upon by the community, standards - how is your work not harmful then? I skimmed through the free preview; just from that, the following questions arose: * Why do you recommend `pylint` over, e.g. `black` or `flake8`? * Imports - what about importing order? Builtins vs 3rd party modules vs own modules? How do you order them? Should `from foo import bar` go before `import baz`, after, or something else altogether? This is a style **guide**, it should answer questions that might arise in the reader - it doesn't. * `Python does not support overloaded methods/functions and default arguments are an easy way of "faking" the overloading behaviour.` How do you distinguish "real" overloading from what you just described (which is "the more popular way of implementing overloading in Python"; you can also always use strategy + compose method patterns...)? Why do you feel the need to make the distinction? * What is the advantage of your book over Writing Idiomatic Python + PEP-8/Google Python Style Guide/FB style (which `black` enforces)? Idiomatic Python is less opinionated than your book and provides examples for WHY things shouldn't be done instead of just saying that they shouldn't be done (e.g. `2.12.4 Decision Okay to use with this caveat: do not use mutable objects as default values in the function or method definition.`). `Avoid@staticmethodand limit use of@classmethod` Why? By this point I was pretty done. I respect the amount of work you put into this, I really do, but the execution is plain bad. I'm not saying this to spite you or anything - I tutor quite a lot of people and in my experience, the resources that we have for styling are absolutely sufficient AND are used widely in the community. If one of them used your book as their style guide, there would be a lot of harm to be undone.
any good tutorials? I mean, I do a lot of debugging, but really only the breakpoint and step functions. No conditional stuff, orwhatever other fancy things but I think there is still so much to improve. Same with profiling.
That’s the idea: start from something simple to show them how program what they learn in Linear Algebra. They won’t take the code, and use it, I will use it as a template to teach them (they might not even see it). After that, they will have time to improve their code and see industry standards and compare with them. Starting from numpy/scipy it’s pointless because they won’t bother to see how the code works, they will use numpy.linalg.whateverfunc() and forget about the internals, i.e. not learning how to program.
As acknowledged by the author, the book is essentially identical to the Google style guide: https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html
 [https://github.com/BerkayM/karbon](https://github.com/BerkayM/karbon) Here is the github page .
Logging and debugging aren't mutually exclusive. They solve different problems and are not substitutes for each other: you can't use debugger in production code, and logger won't show you as much info, unless you log the state of everything after every linr of code. Personally, I use debugger when I start questioning my sanity: when the code seems like it should do one thing, but it actually does another. Still, I can see your point. Overusing the debugger may lead to harmful way of programming where you just run the debugger after each line you write without thinking about what you do. Also, I'm not sure you can easily debug multithreaded/async code.
You should use spaces for the sake of consistency. Rest of the python developers use spaces.
Then what will knowing the code beforehand achieve?

Thanks! I have a script that logs my cryptocurrencies (I use the cryptonator api but I'm not happy with that, does anyone knows a better one?) every 5 minutes and this seems like a fun project to request that information.
...and thus unnecessary. And kinda in bad taste? Just copy-pasting whole paragraphs and putting your name on it is... eh?
That is a very odd claim.
Neat! I'm fascinated by plants and fractals, and I just recently learned about L-systems. I plan on making something similar. I've already started figuring out how to do this programmatically, but I'll look into doing it visually as well in a while. So far I've only used deterministic grammar like you (where, given the same axiom and rules, you always end up with the same structure). But my end goal is to use stochastic grammar to make more natural/unique trees.

That's a bad idea. Just install it inside the virtualenv, and post on /r/learnpython if you experience any issues.
I don't think you can (someone please correct me if I'm wrong). A Python virtual environment is an isolated independent Python environment, everything you do within a virtual environment stays in that environment.
Upvoted :-)
You can make the virtualenv inherit the system packages upon creation but I don't know how to add system packages to an existing virtualenv.
Great tutorial! Perhaps, you could write a word or two on whether this code has to be hosted somewhere or just submitted to Telegram? I am not sure if this is a dumb question, but once you wrote the script and dockerized it, Telegram has to gain access to it somehow, right?
Why? There's a lot of cruft involved when dealing with PyCharm, for example simply passing arguments to script is pain in the ass. PyCharm's terminal emulator is pretty terrible too. Good ol' terminal is a much more fluid experience.
Suggestion: Recreate your virtualenv, run *pip freeze &gt; requirements.txt* inside your virtualenv and you can get a list with all installed packages. Create a new virtualenv that would inherit the system packages and use the *pip install -r requirements.txt* to install all packages from the previous environment.

No, Telegram does not run your code. You run the code yourself (on your PC, or rather somewhere on server) and the code communicates with Telegram API.
yeah, i already noticed some wierd input lag when im doing the image stuff so i think i'll get the basics down and then see about translating it across to something else. I haven't done much c== in a long time :/
One thing that always bites me in the ass with f-strings is when I forget that the outer single/double quotes don't mix well with matched inner single/double quotes. eg: f'Hello my name is {foo('Bob')}' And the interpreter spitting out "SyntaxError: invalid syntax" is not exactly helpful.
Yeah the general idea behind their products seems to be "IDE for project's main language, plugins to fill any gaps". The plugins are great but substituting it as an IDE itself is just difficult.
You need either an edu email, proof of enrollment, or a github student education pack (prove to github you're a student and link your account)
Use 4 spaces or set your tab to 4 spaces.
As a maintainer for indeed the truly early PlasmaPy project (and thanks for the shoutout, /u/plasma_phys !)... if you want actual numerical simulation, I would recommend looking into [fbpic](https://github.com/fbpic/fbpic) for Python/Numba/MPI or [PyFR](https://github.com/vincentlab/PyFR) for GPUs.
Two Scoops is good though :D
That's how I had to do conditional breakpoints in Visual Studio (not VS Code), because the conditional ones would slow execution to a crawl. By doing if(some_breaking_condition) { // breakpoint goes here } The execution speed seems unaffected.
Oh, cool! So you’re saying you just have to run it once to push what you want to do to Telegram? Do you just edit the code and rerun it to update something?
Rookout is free now so it's also worth a try, especially if you're debugging in prod.
If you just have a couple of plotting scripts that don't have any dependencies other than matplotlib, one hack is to begin the script with #!/bin/python and make it executable. That doesn't install matplotlib inside the virtualenv but instead executes the entire script using the system python. That allows you to run the script without deactivating the virtualenv.
No, you need to have the script running on a device yourself at all the time for it to work. Telegram is not hosting the script.
I would recommend pybind11 instead.
You are not pushing the bot to Telegram. You are sending messages to Telegram from your code (the telegram library does that). You are fetching messages from Telegram. Your program needs to be running the whole time, otherwise the bot is not working.
Dunno if you looked at the guy in the video's company, but he makes a free debugger, Rookout, which is somewhere in between. You set a "breakpoint" but Rookout essentially injects a `print()` line dynamically into to the code at that point, even while it's running, and catches the relevant output. It's a best-of-both-worlds thing.
I like this toast module. A Github project would be much more trustworthy than Mediafire. Also you should be using something else than a txt file for the config. Try configparser out. "Comment from " + str(message.author), str(message.body), duration=10 could also be f'Comment from {message.author}', message.body, duration=10 etc etc
Weird. I used pycharm before emacs.
Yeah this is soooo nice for when parsing lines of a file.
I know how to do it. At least I did in pycharm. I just used it so infrequently that I kind of didn’t miss it after the move.
&gt; and other desserts There's always a gotcha in the fine print.
Are we not fat enough? Do we not have trouble concentrating as it is. How dare you HOW DARE YOU!
&gt; use the whitespaces instead of tabs for god's sake He told you right in the example... If you use spaces instead of tabs, you will receive a deity's Japanese alcoholic drink made of fermented rice.
I have a small section on the bottom about Docker. Basically you just have your script running somewhere. This could be your laptop, or (in my case) a server. On a laptop the bot will be then only available when your laptop is on of course ;)

Yes this is how the future is built. Fewer gatekeepers, less mystery around programming, and an attitude of “hey, let’s *make* something for fun”
Most of the debuggers (including pdb) allows you to print output anyway and you can setup the code so that it outputs at all steps. Putting a `print()` in a code is not the hard part, the hard part is *knowing where to put it*. And it is not always the place where the error was triggered. Determining the correct location requires some thinking and understanding of the code structure.
You won’t believe number seven!
&gt; google style guide Which is what this book contains, as far as I understand.
Actually, I went to do this and found it was not compatible with my version which is the latest in the Arch packages (2018.3). That led me to download 2019.2 from the AUR which looks much better and then installing the MD theme plugin, and changing the default fonts etc, it now looks very good. Jetbrains should improve this out of the box.
I don't think it's upvoted because it's a style guilde.
No, it's upvoted because "hai guize i writted a book luk it haz cheezcake"; I refuse to believe anyone upvoting tried to actually read it because someone should have realized it's Google Style Guide. And the author sells it on Amazon. It's not cool.
You have a super rambling (maybe "conversational" would be a better descriptor) writing style (do you really need¹ to go off on so many parenthesised tangents?) but this is a decent article. --- ¹Maybe judicious use of footnotes would make for clearer writing.
This post hasn't been artificially inflated and astroturfed at all.

The interactive window is just an embedded jupyter notebook with a dark theme, if you want you can just close the text editor file window and leave the interactive window open an write code there directly, output below code just like you like. Then you can save the notebook from the upper right menu.
Thank you, this worked great!!
Yeah? I'll look into it. Dealing with the email was probably the most annoying part.
100% agree. That's why it's nice to be able to effectively add and remove `print()` lines on the fly from code in prod without having to redeploy or change the code itself.
The best according to me!
Got it, thanks guys. So, just like a regular API then... I guess this is convenient if you already have a server that you use for something else. I can’t imagine someone keeping their pc up all the time, or getting a server just for a telegram bot.
I am a beginner and can attest that it is a good book. If you are a fast learner go for stuff!:)

I think if you know the basics of C++ you could get into it. You could also use it for the processing part and use Python for the rest.

Sure thing I will look into documentation for 'pyproject,py' and Pipfile. Also just removed that 'main\_project' function from 'run,py' because it was useless and now i'm just calling main, can't seem to remember why I thought that was a good idea. But i'm keeping 'run,py' tell I have some other way of running a python program from the root directory with a Terminal/Command Prompt.
Getting a proper build system is what's going to allow you to run the program from the root directory. Also, look into `__main__.py`.
I'm from Oslo, Norway and I made a script to print Github-like avatars in your terminal: [avatar.py](https://gist.github.com/s-o-r-r-o-w/74a400620dba571d27e3cd23a9beb087) And now you can look forward to my relaunch of the most disruptive product in the history of the Github avatar generation space. avatar.py will soon be replaced by a full suite of avatar generation tools: **Pyvatar**
The code in `os.py` is mostly glue code. It imports either `nt` or `posix` depending on what OS it's running on, then imports all of the supported functions from the implementation module into its own namespace. The implementation is at https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/3939c321c90283b49eddde762656e4b1940e7150/Modules/posixmodule.c#L2824
You can make sure it does nothing funky.
Yeah I found that and to be honest EWS appears that way to, until something just clicks, I've got a script that monitors an inbox using EWS once something appears it downloads all attachments prints them all and moves the email to a completed folder
The file you've linked imports everything from https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Modules/posixmodule.c making use of [Argument Clinic](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/clinic.html) to end up calling `os_chmod_impl`. It's `os_chmod_impl` that ends up calling the system's `chmod()`.
`os.py` is a wrapper that exposes different functions depending on the OS that you're currently running on. So chmod() is defined either in `posix `as a system call for unix-likes or `nt` as, well, whatever windows uses. See how at line 48 it either imports posix or nt depending on the system.
I went looking for this, and I found it mere seconds ago. Came back here to share, but you beat me to the punch. Well done!
Ok we'll look into that thanks. But two quick questions, is there a Python build system, would it be wrong to use Meson?
But if it does anything funky you can know it by opening the file with a text editor before running it.
I want this!
Thanks - I had not heard of fbpic. I am familiar with PyFR, although some people would say it's "not actually in Python". I see that fbpic uses Numba. What advantages are there for Numba over other compiling tools like Cython and PyPy?
Using Meson would be, at the very least, unconventional, and you'd have to reimplement most of the things existing Python-specific build tools already do, so please don't do that. You can't fit everything into Meson.
Hi Jason, &amp;#x200B; Great app and concept. I've been wanting to do this as well, but had trouble web scraping UFC's site with BeautifulSoup. It was being blocked. How were you able to get around it? &amp;#x200B; JB
I type the pipe install command and it wont install. Then I did it manually, but when I tried to run the setup.py code, it had bugs.
That would be great! Thanks for the support
Shit, I'd buy it.
I value simplicity and consistency so I am drawn to editors like vscode. That being said, I can see situations where pycharm would pay dividends. I used to love the ruby ide from jetbrains.
Not trying to just asking an expert a simple question or two before I make any changes so I don't make a mastic of jumping into a rabbit hole. &amp;#x200B; Would this work for a starting 'setup,py' file? import setuptools, setup setup( name='py3-program', version='0.1.0', packages='src', )
Never tried, but seems that pybind allow you to import C/C++ code into python. Cython allow you to code in a python like language, and compile it as C/C++ and import it as a python module. cython is a super-set of python, so you can simply copy/paste python code and compile it, and optimize it as you go along.
Yes, but I'd look into using Poetry and `pyproject.toml` instead. It's not as powerful, but it lets you have a declarative configuration file instead of code, and it provides dependency locking, which is really nice for applications.
You may have better luck at /r/learnpython
You'll first have to decide if you want the "moves" to be from your view or the ant's. If from your view, the commands would be synonymous with the names of the faces of the cube: front, back, left, right, up, down. If from the ant's view, then the commands would be forward, backward, left, and right, but they would lead to different faces depending on where the ant is and which way it is facing.
I picked up an HTML for Kids book in 1998 at the Scholastic book fair at my school–I was 10 years old and made a variety of silly websites about my pets and favorite stuff and put them on the 5mb hosting we got for free with our dialup connection. Then I started wondering what that cgi-bin folder was for... here we are two decades later and I give that book a lot of credit in getting me hooked early on what has turned into a great career! Not every kid will show an interest, but for those who do this kind of book can really spark creative exploration of all the cool stuff you can do with a computer.

It would _work_, but it would also mean that your users basically get a different version of your package depending on how they build it, and that's rarely a good thing.

I'm restarting my learning after starting out last year and getting distracted by life. So right now, I'm working on trying to remember the basics
The nice thing about pybind11 is that interfacing is ridiculously easy, as pybind11 does everything for you, and it's only a single compile step to create a shared library you can import in python. Cython is *way* more complicated to use. For example, in pybind11 you can have a function argument like `py::array_t&lt;float&gt;`, which is a numpy array, and you can do manipulations to it from C++. Or say you have some complicated procedure for initialising a numpy array which involves lots of for loops so you don't want to do it in python, with pybind11 you initialise the numpy array in C++ (!) and return a reference to it that you can use from python (no copy!). It is *way* better than cython. Cython means learning a new language, complicating stuff that does not need to be complicated (suddenly you're compiling all your python code), and [you can't / it's more complicated to] leverage existing C++ libraries (which is a good skill to have, if you have any intention at all of working a professional developer).
Nice, thanks!
All those operators and pics on the cover, I wanted one of them to say `rm -rf`
Well in practice some kind of server would be recommended. You can get the aws free tier servers. The script itself does not require anything special in terms of resources. It's super lightweight
I didn’t know Carol Vorderman was writing programming books now, I think the name recognition (in the UK at least) will make these a big seller.

Wait this isn't a joke, but a desperate moneygrab?

This really depends on your use case. The default suggestion I have is to bite the bullet and just write it in javascript. That's the best solution to running code in a browser. That being said, it also depends on what you're doing. If you're not interacting with the DOM at all then you could probably write a browser extension that just passes the information you need. This is something that I've done in the past for personal use and it worked pretty well. I use Firefox so I started [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Native_messaging). After the boilerplate stuff it was pretty easy. Passed everything back and forth as JSON. This way I could keep my Python app as Python and never have to worry about something not being converted correctly. But mainly there are a lot of restrictions on what javascript can do in a browser, and restrictions on what a webextension can do. So by doing everything with Python I could do things like create a sqlite db to dump data to, read and write to local files, make unrestricted network requests, etc. Plus I could make any changes quickly without even having to touch anything in the browser, since I was just handling the data I received differently.
Okay alright. Wait for the update in the post.
I think I need that and I'm an adult
Ok. Updated..

It will ask you to open "Google" for searching about ';calc'.
Will it really? Why don't you try it?
Sir.? what is;calc On it! Would you like me to Google that for you? and then, if you enter 'yes' it'll search...
Thanks! This will give my kids something to do for the summer.
Always goog to learn new think ! I will try it.
Enter "yes" for me, please.
Has anyone read the books? Do you recommend them and why? I'm thinking about getting some books for python (emphasis on games) and I just saw this post.
Are you serious? Either you don't have Python or don't know how to open the file. Stop wasting my time. There are links given for the source code as well. YOU CAN TRY IT. Ok. I entered 'yes' and it opened the site 'https://www.google.com/search?q=what+is;calc' for me.
That's definitely not what it does.
&gt;Then I started wondering what that cgi-bin folder was for... For the ignorant: &gt; &gt; A CGI-bin is a folder used to house scripts that will interact with a Web browser to provide functionality for a Web page or website. Common Gateway Interface (CGI) is a resource for accommodating the use of scripts in Web design. As scripts are sent from a server to a Web browser, the CGI-bin is often referenced in a url. [source](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/5585/cgi-bin)
What the actual f..? Are you even a human? Or a bot made to kill brain cells. It works on WINDOWS dipshit. Extract the whole program and put it in the same folder. Launch the specified name.
Oh ok. It launches the actual calculator file. You could use ?##cmdcode &amp;&amp;calc #OR ?##cmdcode calc
Is this something built into python
And you shouldn't be using `os.system` for everything.
I could've used 'webbrowser' but in most Windows, developers use the web browsers from other drives. This would create a problem in setting paths. os.system is way easier than that.
And, hey could you un-downvote me please. It seems like I got stuck in 0.
No way man! That's cool!
Look at requests and beautifulsoup
I think I have the same book
Wish I had it as a kid!! python = my_fav
They are intros to the language that also allow you to do some little projects. Also check out [https://automatetheboringstuff.com/](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) and [https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects?software%5B%5D=python](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects?software%5B%5D=python)
That's a great idea and is only fair really. I'll see if I can do the same. Cheers!
13 year old here, I'm getting into programming because of a book about python for kids. I haven't been doing this stuff for very long but I can already say: Thank christ for Stack Overflow.
CGI-bin is the old, retro way to run a web *app*. It's beautiful in a primitive way: The old web servers (usually Apache) mostly knew how to do two things. 1, just serve an HTML page from the disk, or 2 ("CGI") run **any** program on the computer, and send back its output as the web "page". You can probably imagine, this led to all kinds of security problems. But it also made it easy to connect **anything** to the web.
I've been programming for 40 years, and these look fun to me. I'd at least pick up the *Games* one and flip through it.
Thanks for suggestions! I'm already doing the Automate the Boring Stuff With Python course (25% done😁). I was just wondering if there are any great project or game suggestions cause my inspiration is failing me. Lol. Oh, I intend to continue with Sweigart's book about making games in python. Would you recommend Arduino or Raspberry Pi? I already did some research on my own but I couldn't decide between the two. Thanks again, I appreciate it🙂
Sure. No worries. I like [https://pythonprogramming.net/game-development-tutorials/](https://pythonprogramming.net/game-development-tutorials/) too.
Is the author Carol Vorderman from Countdown?

I haven't used PyPy, but last time I heard there was a bunch of compatibility problems with Numpy and the rest of the scientific stack. &amp;#x200B; Advantages over Cython: * Less of a headache with compiling and using separate files - using numba for your calculations lets you ship noarch packages instead of compiling separately per OS * tends to be \[just as fast\]([https://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2013/06/15/numba-vs-cython-take-2/](https://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2013/06/15/numba-vs-cython-take-2/)) while the code you're writing is still closer to Pythonic * GPU support, CuPy compatibility (there's no way we're getting that with Cython any time soon) * Plays nicely with Dask if you're into that kind of thing
Thanks, I'll check it out!😁
Could you show us the relevant code? It's kinda hard to help you without knowing the details.
Wow. You must have seen the industry change tremendously. Would you care to share some thoughts? I'm pretty new (26 years old, 3 years in programming) and I could learn a lot from your experiences.
If the UI more closely matched actual notebooks I'd use it a lot more. The text based cells are just clunky to me.
 Update: def get_testDoc(skills): testtxt = [line.rstrip('\n')for line in open("testdoc.txt")] for i in skills: counter = 0 for x in testtxt: if x == i: counter += 1 print i + " : ", counter
If it's something you'd use in your personal work you can buy a personal license and also use it for business use.
the "for kids" stamp and the colorful aesthetic kind of turns me off though
My bad. I fixed it.
From the ant view, so all the commands (left, right) is for ant. Basically he turns inside cube and move forward. I was recommended to use state machine to solve this but still have no idea how.
Wow! I need that for "my little nephew".
Wow, that's awesome. There wasn't anything like this in '90-91 when I was compiling my own games in Turbo Pascal. Kids are going to be ridiculous coders by the time they're *out of high school*. I can't even imagine. 😁
I strongly suggest \*not\* to learn socket programming directly, especially if you're new to Python and have no previous experience with the socket API. Instead, spend your time learning a higher level protocol/library that more closely matches what you are trying to achieve with your networked program, such as HTTP, ZeroMQ or perhaps Pyro4/Pyro5 (disclaimer: Pyro is my project).
Them it bugs and sits in a corner for the rest of eternity. Just let kids be kids
is the one on the left the book with dark mode on?
Back in 2005, when I was 8yo, my uncle (who works with nothing related to IT) gave me a HTML 4.0 book from a course he had taken some years before. It was all fun, and the book mentioned the reader should progress by learning *modern programming languages such as Perl and C++*. I tried CPP but, as a kid who didn't know English, trying a programming language full of declarative terms such as void, int, float, define and so on was kinda a horrible death. The book I bought didn't help either, because it was extremely technical, sort of a quick guide. A few months later, I heard of Python, and how nice it was, and how it was growing. So, when Christmas came, I asked my parents for a Python book from O'Reilly (the only one in Portuguese I could find at the time.) It helped improving my English. It helped me with Maths, specially geometry and logical-thinking. It also helped expressing myself in creative manners. All in all, it was very good. I kept studying programming languages and nowadays ~~cpp is one of my favourite languages and a weapon of mass destruction in my hands~~ I work with I.T. with passion. I feel really glad to see we finally have this kind of book for kids. They deserve it. (Specially because they're programming such an amazing language as Python.)
For someone(ME) that has no experience at all in coding but is wanting to get familiar with it, would this be a smart investment?...
Thanks for this link, loved it.
&gt; and actually reading the code then I know what the code flow is instead of guessing and trying to find it out with a debugger. I feel like you're using debuggers incorrectly if you feel like you're guessing.
This sounds interesting, but I think it would benefit from a better comparison with other tools that attempt to do the same. I read the Read the Docs page that attempts to do this comparison https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/comparisons.html but it doesn’t make all the pros and cons clear. For example, I think you’re saying that the advantage of PyOxidizer over PyInstaller is that the resulting exe boots faster because it’s importing modules from memory instead of temp files. Is that right? Is that the only difference? And this neglects to mention that PyOxidizer must be built from source in Rust. PyOxidizer sounds intriguing, but wading through documentation to determine how this compares with existing tools is pretty tough right now.
Where is it?
&gt;led to all kinds of security problems led? LED? Last week I killed an webinterface which had /cgi-bin/write-file.sh and /cgi-bin/read-file.sh RUNNING AS ROOT without any checks at all. Or: "How to get root access in under fifteen seconds". (You can't make that up..) Kids, keep in drugs, don't take school and don't write interfaces sober...
Maybe for life 😊
This looks awesome! I’m no kid but I’d love to flip through the games one. I’ve been programming games through SFML/C++ for some time; does anybody have any pointers about Pygame?
If this is a repo, I'd be happy to help. If this site's content is not tracked by git, that's step #1 :)

Yeah, I think its in arabic too
Yes! We need more books like this. Sadly some of the kids books are too elementary and even teach wrong material (bad programming habbits). Give kids studying programming more benefit of the doubt!
Yeah man! Get one, build cool shit.
My library has the html, css, c++, etc. books in the adult section and all the python books in the pre teens section. I think it's a good idea to get them started with an easy language and I dont mind walking over there if I ever want to learn more about python.

Borders
I suggest providing more details if you want to get any help.
This is very inviting and definitely attractive to people like me who are mainly the creative type as it yells “programming is fun” Makes me wanna learn Python!
not a direct answer, but is there any reason you're compiling from source instead of installing a ready to go package?
I kept getting attribute error saying the following didn't exist like the node. Nonetype
I have the right one in German, design is the same but it doesn’t say „kids“ on the cover 🤔
For actual use? How are you bypassing their AC? Image recognition has its place when you don't have the time/skills to make a bypass.

Ignorance. As to my other options. Where would I find a ready to go package? It’s a shared server hosted by bluehost.
Ok that comparison looks interesting, I will look into using Numba!
I may have been a bit too fast in answering because I was hinting at simply installing a .rpm or .deb from the package manager, but that requires root. However maybe someone knows a way around this to extract the package in your user folder or chroot path perhaps (I don't know if either of those options are viable though) &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; Maybe it's better to get it to compile. You should be able to download and install the libffi header files in a directory of your choosing, rather than relying on the libff-dev package. Include the directory where you put them on the compiler's include path and recompile Python
I can do the step by step execution, but that again, whole waste of time.
We also have a lot of python for kids / coding for kids books in our library.
I'm an adult and I kind of want those.
I very much doubt she is.
Yes, the decorator was added in Python 2.5! It makes it trivial to create your own with a simple yield... here's an excerpt from the [contextlib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/contextlib.html) docs: from contextlib import contextmanager @contextmanager def managed_resource(*args, **kwds): # Code to acquire resource, e.g.: resource = acquire_resource(*args, **kwds) try: yield resource finally: # Code to release resource, e.g.: release_resource(resource) &gt;&gt;&gt; with managed_resource(timeout=3600) as resource: ... # Resource is released at the end of this block, ... # even if code in the block raises an exception
Okay so here is what I am getting. Obviously this is a very specific experiment and changing any variable can greatly affect results. I am not counting the time to build the data structure here, but obviously this could be very relevant for many use cases and immediately takes Pandas out of the running. To get counts for 1 million random integers between 0 and 100 inclusive with dimensions 20 x 50000 takes: .1357 seconds with a 2D list: counts = {num: 0 for num in range(0,101)} count_start = time.perf_counter() for row in test: for num in row: counts[num] += 1 count_end = time.perf_counter() It's also totally possible to use the unique() function on the lists, but which brings the list counting down to .0943, but if this is the only place you use Numpy the import makes it prohibitive (to .19 seconds). .0363 seconds with a Numpy array: count_start = time.perf_counter() unique, counts = np.unique(np_array, return_counts=True) counts = dict(zip(unique, counts)) count_end = time.perf_counter() .1412 seconds if I include the import: count_start = time.perf_counter() import numpy as np np_array = np.random.randint(0,100,size=(20, 50000)) unique, counts = np.unique(np_array, return_counts=True) counts = dict(zip(unique, counts)) count_end = time.perf_counter() Building the array is almost negligible here and is very fast. .0364 seconds counting a Pandas DF with np.unique: count_start = time.perf_counter() unique, counts = np.unique(pandas_df, return_counts=True) counts3 = dict(zip(unique, counts)) count_end = time.perf_counter() .4148 seconds if I include imports: count_start = time.perf_counter() import numpy as np import pandas as pd df = pd.DataFrame(np.random.randint(0,100,size=(20, 50000))) unique, counts = np.unique(df, return_counts=True) counts3 = dict(zip(unique, counts)) count_end = time.perf_counter() The DF build is negligible here, building from an np array like this is very fast. So, I can understand your criticism of my remarks here, but I still think that there isn't much application for Pandas in this instance. If I include a read\_csv or build a DF from a list then it just kills Pandas. In addition, if this is in some kind of pipeline that gets run on demand over and over, the constantly importing Pandas takes Pandas out of the running. If it's a persistent service a single import could be worth it - but it still requires you to use a Numpy function which begs the question why not just use Numpy data structures? There's also the fact that *lots* of Pandas functions are extremely slow so you're probably going to shoot yourself in the foot later even if this one application is sort of as fast as Numpy. This all being said, obviously Numpy is very fast and certainly preferable to Python native data structures for lots of things. If there is a faster way to get counts for a DF, please let me know. I am not a Pandas expert here.
A couple of weeks ago I wrote my first CGI script in about 20 years.
cx_freeze works for PySide and QT
I just ordered these! My kids are getting close to that age where they might start to get interested in this stuff (I won't force it on 'em, though). Also, I've never done anything with pygame before, so it might be fun for me, as well!
One thing that hasn't changed much is these kinds of books. We've had them for as long as I remember, so I'm not sure what point u/willmachineloveus is making. They were especially popular in the early 1980s.
&gt;python for kids which book?
Ha ha ha lol, looks great
Funny thing is the black book was probably the first exposure to python I got!
I’m working on a SEO tool that combines Screaming Frog Data, Google PageSpeed data, Google Search Console data and Google analytics data in a Word document for my customers that want to improve their websites. I did not release it yet on github, but I will soon. It actually runs Screaming Frog and creates all the data on the fly.
Back in the '90s, they weren't putting any kind of coding books on the shelves of my local library for a town of 1200. I was 10-12 years old, and would check out some seriously random reading material. A book on Calculus I wouldn't understand for another six years. Another on the semantics of the German language, one I don't speak. I think I was just looking for my niche in all these awesome non-fiction books. Well, the librarians got a kick out of it. I'd walk in and they'd have books set to the side that I needed to see. Inevitably I ran out of books after year two. Miss Sue, the head librarian took me into the storage section of the library and showed me these boxes of computer books. Cobol, Fortran, QBasic, basically anything from the late '80s were enshrined in a dusty old box in a library in Smalltown, USA. Life changing is putting it mildly. With parents that allowed me to seek my own information, and librarians that made it a personal mission to locate what I was trying to "find," I knew at a very young age what I'd be doing with my life.
Type annotations do everything that Typescript does for Javascript. I highly recommend using them!
Break the input command up, focus on the movements between each jump. After each jump the problem has started again however your walls have been redefined. Think about the first turn, whatever the inputs the Ant spins around a bit and jumps the Ant is now sitting on the &lt;doesn't matter&gt; facet looking at the "Up" facet. So... What facet did the Ant jump to? That's just a matter of counting the left and rights before the jump and subtracting one from the other. If you need more help send me a PM.
i guess you are going to deep if you are getting the error at the first time. you might want to try to print out the tree first make sure you have all your data in the tree
I definitely recommend [Coding for Kids: Python: Learn to Code with 50 Awesome Games and Activities](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1641521759) by the wonderful Adrienne Tacke. It's a fun read and beautifully presented 😊 I bought a copy for my son!
It’s a waste of time to try and do something as computationally expensive as fluid dynamics simulations in native Python, there’s no need to profile anything to know that much.
I'm with you... I was drowning in books like that in the 80s and 90s. It was obscene how big the computer and programming section of Borders (google it) and the local library were-- \--I suppose these days, youTube videos fill that niche better and cheaper.
Awesome. I just came across those. Does it help with intellisense? Like if I were to iterate throught a List of type Welder (List&lt;Welder&gt;) would I get all the methods/properties attached to that class? I plan on allowing it to sync with an API and I just can't imagine dealing with all of the data without having custom types.

Does slow down because of the imports also happen on Python 3?
Is there a way I can make that more efficient?
Thanks for reply, I'll see if I can get my hands on it!😁
/r/learnpython and read the sidebar for starters. And provide a lot more information.
The purpose of my code is not to be high-performance (my research group already has solvers for that), but rather as a flexible framework for experimenting with novel numerical methods on smaller problems. And it’s based on NumPy and SciPy rather than “native” Python, and in the future may be interfaced with compiled or just-in-time compiled code. Most new methods for scientific computing are prototyped first in languages like MATLAB or Python, rather than going straight to a high-performance code.
The additional imports are not so much of a problem as the additional dependencies are. If the SDK was Python 3 only we would probably just have lived with it.
Do you have any resources on doing this? I've been wanting to pull info from different games for a while now but haven't come across anything great for how to do this with Python
Wrote a Python Post-it note application called Pyn, allows you to save all your notes (it remembers the positions etc) all written in PySide2 - [https://github.com/runew0lf/Pyn](https://github.com/runew0lf/Pyn)
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1247486/list-comprehension-vs-map They both operate on a single process. And parallelism wouldn’t really be a benefit anyway given that python is GIL limited and there’s no input/output here (and it wouldn’t spin up a new process on its own). Map is sometimes faster, but generally lost comps are faster/just as fast. But list comps are more pythonic in that they are more expressive.
Appreciate the help. Unfortunately &gt; --with-system-ffi doesn't look like that made much difference. the other suggestion is beyond me. or at least at the moment might try again tomorrow.
It's pretty easy to do with ctypes if you're familiar with Windows memory. I'm not sure if there's a good wrapper library for it. I use Cheat Engine to do the initial discovery / memory map.
Author here. I gotta be me or it won't get wrote. And thank you!
Sells it?! Damn, that's really shitty.
Based on the [official site](http://sim.me.uk/cheesecake/), yeah.
You should be able to compile libffi locally by getting the sources from [ftp://sourceware.org/pub/libffi/libffi-3.2.1.tar.gz](ftp://sourceware.org/pub/libffi/libffi-3.2.1.tar.gz) if you then CFLAGS=-I&lt;path-to-the-extracted-ffi-headers&gt; ./configure it should pick those up

Same issue. though apparently I need libffi-dev I assume that is different than the linked packages. I don't see anything on the ftp site with that suffix any idea where that package might live?
the linked tarball should be the whole source code including the dev header files of libcffi Make sure you set the correct include directory name. &amp;#x200B; another angle: do you need ctypes? if not, you can probably disable the module in the configuration and build python without it?
Probably basic auth, send a header than looks like `Authorization: Basic &lt;payload&gt;` where the payload is a base64 encoded version of "username:password" see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication#Client_side
git2consul is likely what you're looking for.
yeah this was my command: CFLAGS=-I~/tld/lib64/ ./configure --prefix=/home4/diydunce/.local &gt;do you need ctypes? I have no idea what they are but looking at it I don't think It's something I use. How does one disable the module?
I haven't used IntelliJ, but I like pycharm a lot. What attracted me was its refactoring tools for python.
Thanks for the snippets, the timings look similar to the ones I've seen/tried. Its pretty clear from your remarks that we work in pretty different domains, since in my workflows I pretty much don't have to worry about small constant time overheads like importing numpy or pandas. The main reason I use pandas is because labelling data with indexes and supporting heterogeneous data-types out-of-the-box are valuable for the types of data I work with, and while its certainly possible to do some of these things with numpy it would require a serious amount of engineering (akin to a new pandas, which to be fair seems to be a [popular](https://github.com/dexplo/dexplo) [thing](https://pypi.org/project/pandas-lite/) to do). My personal experience is that dropping down into numpy/cython/C from pandas using Series.values when I need to and going through numexpr with df.eval/query/where() is usually good enough when I need to optimize specific things, but it may take some engineering effort and again YMMV. The pandas read_csv() method is written in C and I would expect it to be faster than similar standard-library implementations over some CSV schemas and file sizes, but it does definitely try to do quite a few things (namely type deduction) and it wouldn't surprise me if for example it scaled poorly for files with a &gt; 10GB size. I don't work with large CSVs much myself so I can't really comment. I wouldn't expect it to be faster (possibly slightly slower even, but same order of magnitude as numpy), but there is this syntactic sugar available in pandas: [value_counts()](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.Series.value_counts.html).
It's up to your IDE, but most understand type hints these days.
I’d consider using a defaultdict or a collections.Counter where skills are the keys and increment the values as you find them. You’d only have to iterate the file contents once
it even has dark theme
I'm not sure if this is the correct way to do it, but this seems to work: edit the [setup.py](https://setup.py) file, add "ctypes" and "\_ctypes" to the DISABLED\_MODULES\_LIST ./configure make -j
Use mako template engine :) awesome awesome awesome
Cool. Thanks so much. Appreciate your patience.
It’s intended purpose is to enable static type checking with tools like intellisense. There’s no effect on runtime.
omg.... so that prevented the warning/error for python itself but pip is still puking...

Okay so building without ctypes is not an option then. If you really can't get cffi to build locally, and no other people here provide a better answer than my feeble attempts, maybe try your luck on the #python channel on freenode IRC. I used that a lot in the past, there are very knowledgeable people there
Thanks. I'm currently trying my luck with 3.6.5 but I will check out IRC. Really appreciate your help! Have a good one.

I do various math related Python projects to keep my mind active. This week I'm learning about how Elo systems work. I understand the basics but I want to know how it works in detail and how these systems are tuned to work effectively.
Does this convert to C, then compile, then put it inside a rust executable together with a python executable bunded?

The company I'm working for makes custom laser engraved charging pads. For the laser engraver to work, a .psd file with all the custom text and images needs to be given to be uploaded to Google Drive. We range from 50 to 200 orders a day, and each one takes anywhere from 20 seconds to 2 minutes to do. Although it's not a huge job, it's annoying enough that it's worth automating. I'm writing a program that works with photoshop to make all the artwork and upload it to the laser engraver. I just got done with figuring out how to write a text box into photoshop, now the next task is integrating it with Shopify to automatically load all the orders! Pretty soon it should be fully automated!
Or maybe nested comprehensions: `&gt;&gt;&gt; x = [[[1,2,3],[4,5,6]],[[7,8,9],[10,11,12]]]` `&gt;&gt;&gt; [q for y in x for z in y for q in z]` `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]` If the logic is unclear, try this way: `&gt;&gt;&gt; b = []` `&gt;&gt;&gt; for y in x:` `&gt;&gt;&gt; for z in y:` `&gt;&gt;&gt; for q in z:` `&gt;&gt;&gt; b.append(q)`
thanks ..just requested from my library ..looks fun any similar recommendations? thanks
Thank you, I have just sent it using the Basic Authorization and it worked.
It’s not been discussed because it’s a trivial problem. The best answer, using set(), is in the link you provided. /r/learnpython
I know how to import pygame, and that's the extent of my pygame knowledge
I just wanted a confirmation so that I can go ahead with it
Seems pretty simple to me. I would: 1) split each stripping the space. 2) order them 3) compare
I'm currently working on two projects for NASA's TESS satellite. The first being a simple Django web application which allows users to look at light curve data to vet for exoplanets. The second being tuning and improving the Quick Look Pipeline which is what processes raw image data from the satellite into light curves (this is the fun bit). &amp;#x200B; Hopefully the 2nd version of the vetting web application will be finished this week and I can get back to science!
Don't do it. Just use java script.
Apparently these books are pedagogically dubious. They appeal to parents but have limited use to children as they don’t teach effectively. I own two of them (not these two) and I have to agree, they don’t work very well as a teaching guide. Ok for inspiration though, but you need to follow up with proper instruction.
By far the best investment I've made since learning python.
Yes.
There's also over 100 [Demo Programs](https://github.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI/tree/master/DemoPrograms) that you can use as a starting point. All of these example bits of code are meant to be copied and pasted into your project.
Thank you for making some usefull comment. so how would you order them? Could you please elaborate?
Is the source-code available?
How young can you start teaching kids to code? I have a 19 month old step daughter and I can't wait to introduce her to the love of coding
All of these are trivially easy to draw on a GUI if that’s what you’re asking. The only exception is the bottom right which looks like a literal GPS which is far more complicated that the other 3 combined. The hard part wont be drawing the stuff on the screen, it will be writing the code to get the information that you need to draw on the screen.

Thanks for the suggestion. I haven't dealt with GitHub much in the past and I will learn it first chance I get.
can you provide an example please?
Apparently 2019 is literally just numpy, pandas and machine learning
Yea.. its for a raspberry pi and i actually got the math and components for speed and such worked out, just need to figure out how to get displayed nice. For the GPS, there is a free maps system available for linux, im thinking of just displaying it as its own small window with and area open for it? or sitting on top of the program window
If anyone needs any clarification about what this bot does (in case it is not clear in the video/description). This bot basically bans users based on their participation in other subreddits. Say if you are running /r/Example1, and you don't want people who regularly participate in /r/Example2, then you can use this bot, to ban any people who post in /r/Example2. Hopefully that makes more sense.
I like how there is a manga book below covering the book below to reveal only "Arch". Secret r/unixporn
The defaultdict docs have an example of using int as the default type for counting purposes, which is pretty much exactly your use case. https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/collections.html#collections.defaultdict
I'm no expert, but I'd say post-kindergarten, unless the kid can read well beyond grade level and can handle mathematical concepts.
This is probably where I need to start!
I’d use git and then find a python module that can query it.

So this would be a good replacement for Counter(). However, one of the problems is I am using a file to read in N jobs roles. It is being compared against a file that is basically lorem ipsum. Any word that matches is incremented. This is hard because lets say, I have a single job role of equal to "Red Hat", but this way would be "red" and "hat". This is a problem. I have done the same thing with some code I was throwing together. It is more efficient, but I don't know how to pull "Red Hat" out of lorem ipsum text. Regex would work, the one I was trying to use is `re.search()`. This supposedly takes a List and compares it with a string, if a match is found, then it adds it. I haven't been able to get it to work. It is returning a `TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'`. I gave up on this....
Dude I attempted programming when I was your age but didn't stick with it because it was too hard and back then the internet sucked. I'm 31 now trying to learn python and I'm so bummed out that I have not been doing this for my whole life. I ended up doing networking so I'm still in IT but I could have had a couple of games done by now or at least be good enough to freelance and ditch the office bs. Stick with it!
Hi just Re the github status. I uploaded this to github here: https://github.com/Fengax/RedditNotification
Smptlib ?
Omg you're like wittle irl Matiwlda cuteeeee.
Your “if it sees x then do y” is kinda vague, so maybe this isn’t relevant, but have you tried writing a regular expression with a positive look ahead? I use https://regex101.com to help with more complicated regex patterns, so it’s worth a shot to see if this would be better than looping through strings at a character level.
Don't know why you're being down-voted, you're right.
Yes, that is just you. Pycharm using over a GB of RAM. K have no idea how you're getting up to those numbers with vscode.
If this is your actual location, I would recommend removing it. Anything sensitive (PII, API keys, etc) shouldn't be in version control. You should load from environment variables or a config file and keep that out of your repo. https://github.com/KonigKlack/Weather_Text/blob/b7f2358fe716db54bbea7cdad909b92b6e90fad1/darksky.py#L13
re.search searches a string, not a list of strings. If you just have simple matches like "red hat" you can use the in operator while iterating through the list, ie if role in line. If you need more complex matches you likely want re.findall. It also takes a string not a list, but it returns all matches not just the first one. You could either run it against every line or use read() method to get the entire file as a string.
I’m an adult. And I want these books.
Do you want to send emails to around 500 email addresses? There is `smtplib` which allows you to send emails from a computer setup to send mail (depends on what OS you run). You may also use service like mailgun or sendgrid.

I personally found Stack Overflow as a bit of a double edged sword for new beginners, but I’m glad you like it! When I was starting out, if something didn’t work I could almost always find a useful response on Stack Overflow that would point me in the right direction. But sometimes it seemed like the answer was so blatantly obvious to whoever was replying that they would be condescending simply because they could be.
I use Gist more than Github because my personal projects are all small tools. I have repos for a lot of them but since they're mostly single file projects I stick the finished project in a Gist :shrug: Guess I'm fucked.
No, specifically I also need them to receive, so I would need to set up those 500 accounts or inboxes
Get a cheap webhosting package and use their pop services
why don't you setup a mail server yourself? then you have unlimited addresses. With docker you can even automate the server setup if you want it to be temporary
Nice! I made something similar using C a couple years ago and spent more time than I'd like to admit messing around with it.
Spent a solid 2 hours making the program but then I just couldn’t stop playing with the colors!
Very inefficient solution! It's time complexity is O(N*log(N)) - compared to O(N) (aka *linear*) for the solution using hash sets. Besides the algorithmic complexity the code will be more complex to read and understand. Summary: this proposal has only disadvantages and should therefor not be chosen!
R isn't worth your time. Learn something that actually adds to the list of things you can do on a computer. After years of programming in R, I scrapped it completely in favor of Python. I'm working as a data scientist and don't regret my decision *at all*. The only thing I miss, from time to time, is [Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) stuff; Pandas syntax can be a bit clunky sometimes compared to dplyr.
They both have their strengths. R is better for the quick analysis with data, Python is better if you want to do anything with those data besides analyze them. It's for sure worth learning. I started in R, went over to python/pandas for a few years, now back in R. Base R is ugly and not intuitive in my opinion, I'd jump directly into tidyverse packages, especially dplyr.
Am curious - your English sounds really native. What's your mother tongue?
Cool project! How did you do the part where you find the oldest video, did you use the 'search.list' part of the YouTube Data API and increase the 'publishedBefore' parameter you get some results?
In what way is R better for quick analysis of data?

Take a look at JULIA. Still am a big Python fan.
Check this one out: https://usborne.com/browse-books/catalogue/product/1/11315/coding-for-beginners-using-python/ Got it for my daughter and it was better than the other two.
Thank you so much kind sir.
I learned Python with the view of going into data science, and then pretty quickly realised that there's a ton of other things that would be useful to know too. For example, SQL and database design, or AWS/GCP for cloud computing. Programming isn't only about syntax.
We proud of you too :D

My sister was looking at switching careers. She was trying the games one and asked for some help. It wasn't structured as well as I would like and took a bit of digging to figure out how they wanted everything setup. The book felt like they were trying so hard to make a gui based game so simple it made the process of running the game confusing. I think it's great the library is stocking programing books, I learned C at a young age teaching myself C on a cross country trip reading a book and trying away on a Toshiba Tecra 700CS. The newer books try to jump to quickly to flashy things like a GUI instead of teaching the fundamentals first and then moving to libraries and wrappers.
It was purposefully made that way. Say you want to do a linear regression just type in lm(y ~ x, data = df). The summary() function with give a host of information like p-value, r2, etc and predicting is done with predict() . Scikit-learn will do all this of course, in my experience just more inconviently. ggplot looks better and is easier to grasp than matplotlib I think as well. I tend to use the two languages for what I think are their strengths - quick analysis and make it interactive through a small application? Will take less than an hour with R/Shiny. Need to build out an API to access the stats to plug into a webpage somewhere? Going down python/pandas/scikit-learn/flask route on that one.

Great job, which IDE is this btw
`b'1'` means it's a byte value `1`, not literal "b'1'".
Okay, interesting. And how can I compare this?
Drop double quotes. `if message == b'1'`. Read more about string and byte types in Python3.

At this point I feel like I should create a "mandelbrot reddit post" generating bot, it would do extremely well on this subreddit.
Alright, Cool
Sounds like a massive task, guess you need to find yourself a recruitment budget.
I think there's a horseshoe thing. Back then it was "easy" to pick up a book and make a basic game, then games became too advanced and software became too corporate, now it's normalizing, the the tools are there and there's communities of artists and coders to get started with, so we see the push again for young people to learn things for fun again and its becoming increasingly accessible.

If you feel like a further challenge, there's the [Buddhabrot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhabrot)
**Buddhabrot** The Buddhabrot is a fractal rendering technique related to the Mandelbrot set.

I've been obsessed with the Mandebrot set some years ago, too. The fact that this simple equation produces that sort of drawings just kills me. I winded up using a arbitrary-precision floating point library in order to dive deeper than regular floating point numbers allow. It lasted one whole weekend, it was very fun, I even learned some things. Good job, btw!
Is there anything that it can't be used with Atom?
Can you show us some examples of input and the desired output? I still don't really understand what problem exactly you're trying to solve.
Not sure if this still works but you used to be able to push repos with a doctored history and it would copy the dates to the graphic. You can easily automate this by specifying the datetimes when your script generates a commit. So obviously some person made a pixel art generator.
Just a hobbyist doing a personal project, but I'm building a meal/nutrition tracker and planner with a pyside2 interface and a sqlite backend. I know this wheel had already been invented a few dozen times by many big websites but IMO the other wheels are all dumpster fires. Mine does arbitrary nesting with per-level nutrient aggregation and the main window uses a qtreeview with spinboxes so you can immediately see how an increase or reduction of an ingredient affects your totals for the meal, day, etc. Nutrient columns are not limited to the usual selection you see on a food label so if you are importing the insanely detailed data on generic foods from the USDA FDC database you can view that too (or not; just turn those columns off). Eventually I will integrate a barcode scanner and a serial or USB interface to an Arduino powered digital scale for faster data entry.
You should probably scan any uploads with Anti Virus too to be sure just in case.
Which area pf programing is it? I also want to try my hand at it.
that worked, thank you!
99% of the time I use R for the tidyverse syntax. There is also a very nice keras library for machine learning too.
Frame the problem and ask the team for someone who can do some analysis and make a proposal. Consider starting small on the problem scope and include prototypes in the measure of success. Really comes down to how the team works and their processes that already exist. But try to incorporate it into what they already do. For example, when should we transition from version X to Y and how.
So, python is not designed to be a self-learning algorithm toolkit. Those exist in libraries for python, and it’s a good language to pick up as a first at this level of abstraction. At the end of the day, all programming languages are tools, not solutions. Your team will need to use a programming language to interact with the machine learning algorithms, and Python is a popular choice. The most important part of effectively utilizing ML and AI tools is an understanding of the data you’re feeding into the system, and the results you test the algorithms against. At this point, there are no general purpose prediction algorithms. What ML can do is classify input data into bins. You can set one of the bins up to be “needs maintenance soon”. You need to provide data for the machine to learn against, usually pre-tagged with which bin it belongs to. And you need that data to include indicators of maintenance requirements. If you give an algorithm a bunch of pictures of controllers, with more Rockwell ones being tagged for maintenance, it might learn that Rockwell controllers are the ones that need maintenance, and nothing else does. Good luck, ML is tons of fun. I recommend fast.ai for a primer on what tested algorithms are known to be able to accomplish.

Thanks, that's very nice to hear :) I'm Brazilian. Thus, my mother tongue is Portuguese.
I thought mypy didn't support this, as per [this issue](https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/5205) and this [pr](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/5208) - could you point out the PR/commit where they change their mind?
Trying to figure out how PyCharm and Python should be installed on my computer so I can finally import the damn Openpyxl module
It doesn't really and they haven't, this is more of just a temporary hack. Notice that I am using mypy instead of tool.mypy, etc. Which is just what mypy looks for in it's config files. Poetry doesn't really know how to handle it and so I'm guessing it is skipped over in poetry's parsing.
I need these, I'll admit it now
Dedent! Better plots!
Yes, as mentioned in the "About" section of my website. [Here's](https://github.com/BassThatHertz/onlineaudioconverter) the link to the GitHub repository. Feel free to make any changes to the code and submit a pull request. I'm very new to JavaScript. The upload progress feature was copied from a tutorial. I'm also fairly new to programming in general, Python is my first language and I started learning it this year.
So they have proper linting now?
I see, thanks.
If you don't use PUB/SUB, you can use the convenience functions: `sock.send_pyobj(your_object)` On the receiver side, you call `sock.recv_pyobj()` If you're using PUB/SUB with topics, you should read this issue: [issues/957](https://github.com/zeromq/pyzmq/issues/957) &amp;#x200B; In my projects I use pyzmq very low-level. I use PUB/SUB together with topics and the most called functions are `topic, *data = sock.recv_multipart()` and `sock.send_multipart([b'topic', *data])`
can you post it on github please :)
I think the zip solution from stackoverflow is the one I'd use.
I dislike R as much as the next guy, but as a statistician it's pretty hard to avoid. I guess it's different for data scientists.

Working on some adhoc monitoring scripts to retrieve some data from remote servers.
You might have better luck at /r/learnpython
Can you put your code and error into a pastebin like https://dpaste.de ?
Hard to tell without a codeblock, makes it pretty unreadable. But if it's an indentation error it should be pretty simple, you probably forgot to indent `strawberry.x = randint(10, 800)`
