Well your entire industry has several years to convince the core dev team to slightly modify this PEP.
I mean, at least Apple doesn’t force candy crush on you
do you have previous experience with coding or u started from scratch?
Reminds me of PowerShell.. permanently backwards compatible where some bugs had to stay for that to be true
That's a good possibility. I have windows on all my pcs because I like to game and for work. I do have linux installed on a couple partitions on my home rig but this just makes it easier for me personally. Whatever their motivation is, I can't complain
I have only given the code a very quick glance-over, but for a first project it looks quite well written to me. I especially like that you use several well-named functions. Things you can look at: * Extract more functions from large functions. For example, `is_valid_king_move()` looks to be too long to me. Same for the code in the global code. Functions can not only be used for re-using logic, but also for structuring code, documenting it, and for improving the ability to reason about it. * Look for repeated logic and extract functions. For example, in `is_valid_king_move()`, you have several blocks called "North West Jump - Delete Enemy" etc. Without looks at them in-depth, it seems that they contain a lot of repeated code and to differ only in details. Try to find a way to write a generic function for these. * Split code into multiple module. For example, it might be useful that have a module `moves.py` that contains all move-related logic, or maybe a module `board.py`? * When you have some set of data and logic that operates on this data, consider using a class. For example, it might make sense to have a class `Board`, and encapsulate the array of arrays in that class. This class could have methods like `set_color(x, y, color)` or `has_color(x, y)`. No other function should then have knowledge about the internal representation of the board and just use these functions. * Remove magic numbers. As far as I can tell, you use numbers to represent board state. I'd recommend to either use constants, which you defined at the top of the file (`RED = 1`, `BLACK = 2`, etc.) or look into using [Enums](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/enum.html) for these.
There are other issues than those requiring commits. Eg. their tests are adding to the test suite time on every run, and even have the potential to generate errors (potentially even spurious ones, like they mentioned with nntp) which may cost you developer time to check. Also, some may even constrain you from making changes, or at least add work to them. Eg the parser needing to reflect grammar changes, and limiting the parser implementation. There's also stuff like adding to distribution size, build time etc. Sure, pretty minor, but given something downloaded as much as python, it does add up. And even if you are using them, the impact on you is not that huge: you just need to install an extra module when you upgrade python. And TBH, for most of those, I kind of doubt anyone still using code old enough to use them would ever have upgraded that code to python 3 in the first place.
It starts from scratch.
250,000 ipv4 addresses will set you back around $5 million USD. You can assign the entire block to a single physical host. Then you can use the low level socket libraries in python to send requests via a particular network interface alias. Throw in some asyncio and thread pools and you could have it all execute in a couple seconds.... provided the site doesn't go down.
Convince 4chan it needs some views.

Itertools was a huge help when I was interviewing. I haven’t used python that much recently so let’s see what the community thinks.

Microsoft actively promotes MSI use.
Can someone enlighten me why this should motivate Bezos to hire u/KinoZampie?
What is it like actually?
Nobody can, and it wont.
Yup, we've got an industry working group so we'll figure something out. Unfortunately security can be incredible tight at some facilities, making it difficult to use external modules.
Not for much longer- conversion process begins this year (finally), and we're all moving to 3.7
&gt;and rewrite it into Python while keeping the same interface You can do everything that `getopt` does with `argparse` (and more) while maintaining the same "interface" if you're talking about the program. It's just that it is easier for the programmer familiar with C to change to python. However more complicated the use case gets `argparse` does far better as the [last example](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/getopt.html) from the official docs show. One of the main reasons why Python was created and used by so many is that it enables one to write more concise and clear code compared to other languages like C. I agree though that it not a maintenance burden, but we should eventually move to the one obvious way of doing things rather than four.
I've always thought of using parallel, but never tried it. Multiprocessing gives you a lot of out the box though, shared queues and a work queue.
We're already making hourly calls to Nancy Pelosi's office and are encouraging them to issue subpoenas.

Not that I've ever heard of. You'd best DIY, as calculating proportions is something I personally use frequently. I use them almost every time I go grocery shopping .
&gt; You are suggesting I just use C2 to determine the closest food? Yup. If the distance is smaller, so will the distance squared be. If you don't have to do the square root -- which it sounds like you don't, since you're less interested in the exact distance than in how distances relate to one another -- then there's no reason to.
yep :)
Good, idea. Thank you!
&gt; you cant copy or paste into anything outside of vim just makes them so impractical for real world usecases That's just false. You just confirmed my point in previous comment. Most people think Vim is "impractical" or "less powerful" than other IDEs is because they are not aware what Vim can do because they haven't read the manual. Lookup `:h 'clipboard'`. In particular set it to `unnamed` or `unnamedplus` and you'd be able to copy paste everything to and from Vim using `"` and `+` registers. Not to mention if you're using terminal Vim, most terminal emulators allow you to copy paste normally using mouse and Ctrl + Shift + c/v, Ctrl + Insert etc. Also Pycharm + Vim bindings is not Vim or "best of both worlds", it will never be. It is a good IDE for developing Python programs with Vim keybindings, that's it. Vim can be that and much much more thanks to its programmability. Not to mention the significantly less resource it needs compared to other IDEs.
Lets pretend you have a radius of 1 and 1, you scan it once and if it finds no food, 2 and 2, and so on, or a x and y radius already set like 10 10, and you dont actually need an x and y for food, just a condition for true/false once it hits the radius

You can try this, which I translated from javascript: https://gist.github.com/pokepetter/53c906d662a7ef15c28145825eec060f If look at a midi file in hex, "90" means note on and the bytes after says what note it is. 90 3c 28 = note-on C4 More in-depth here: http://wiki.ccarh.org/wiki/MIDI_file_parsing_homework
&gt; If you ever see code with range(len(...)), you’ll almost always want to use enumerate instead. I'd quibble with that "almost always" here, especially since it's specifically talking about "newer Pythonistas" here, in that for a lot of newbie code, even enumerate is redundant. A lot of people (especially coming from c-like languages) do the `for i in range(len(l))` thing and then access items as `l[i]`, when they *could* just iterate over the objects directly, no indices needed. And even a lot of cases where the indices **are** used can often be better replaced other ways. Eg. a common usecase is when dealing with two lists in paralell, where they're dealing with `list1[i]` along with `list2[i]`, which are generally better handled with `zip`. Of course, sometimes you *do* want the indexes, and indeed, enumerate is best for that.
Don't be discouraged.. It's okay.. Those blue arrows is nothing but just people sharing thought which is okay too! Reddit is a great place to discover, share and debate many things!
I think it needd to have the PATH directives from the user variables to the System/machine PATH. I also had this issue the other day after I installed 1903, I set the python folders to the user PATH and every time I ran my code in VS Code studio, the store started with the page telling me to get Python from the store for free. That shit stopped after I added the folders to the system/machine PATH.
This is not the right way. Even using the Store for WSL distros was weird. Microsoft should buy Chocolatey and publish official packages, separating developer stuff from normal GUI stuff. I mean, you can't even install stuff from the Windows Store from the command line!
You can use Twisted as a secondary library using Crochet: [https://crochet.readthedocs.io/en/stable/](https://crochet.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) &amp;#x200B; However, you're designing an event-driven system, and that requires some sort of event loop, and any of (Twisted, Asyncio, Trio) will work better if you just give them control they need.
the examples are good, loved trying them out

Why would one want to run virtualenv inside a docker container in the first place?
So mostly ... *shrug.* I started using Python in '98 although I probably didn't poke my head into the standard library until '99 and remember looking at things like *sunau* and thinking, "Wow, there is some old, random cruft in here ...". Fair game to clean most of the modules in the PEP out. &amp;#x200B; It should be mentioned that most of these libs are single-file modules. Heck, most were likely written before Python even supported putting code in directories and having packages. If you want to continue using a module and don't want to fiddle with PyPI or deal with adding half-maintained PyPI dependencies, you can just go into your \`lib/python3.7\` directory and copy the file into your own project. &amp;#x200B; It would be a real bonus if these libs got packaged and versioned before being ejected from the standard library though. Users should be able to do this on Python 3.9: $ pip list Package Version ---------------- ---------- cgi 2.6 $ pip install cgi==2.6 This would allow people to install a PyPI library that shadowed over the standard lib version, and let them back that dependency into their tooling, etc. &amp;#x200B; But I guess it remains to be seen who will take over which library and likely some of these libs may be published multiple times on PyPI as they take on multiple forks ... but perhaps most of these are so old that so few folks will miss them and no one will even bothers to chuck 'em on PyPI.
A civilization!
(OP here) I'm embarrassed to admit that I've never even heard of gevent. I'll spend some time messing around with it. Getting up the asyncio learning curve wasn't too bad, but by the time I was done I really disliked having to rewrite \*all\* of my code with the async keyword.
Maybe it's just poor marketing?
thks with crochet The problem is that the main lib do its own stuff (obviously XD) that are heavy, requieres full control over all parts to sychronize, avoid duplications, and everything else (threads, locks, queues and all sort of crazy stuff that may be clean in a future but not my priority now...) and the udp part is REALLY time sensitive (im talking of u sec, and yes is needed, and is noticeable because of unavoidable market reasons) ...
thanks... : ) What is the "ticks" parameter? Is this the note length? And are you parsing a multi-track midi file? Mine just has one track.
So far in Python's history, backwards compatibility has 99% of the time trumped a tidy codebase. I'm pretty darn comfortable with this new stance of more aggressively removing stuff that actually costs real human time to maintain.
Idea noted. Thanks! :)
only to maintain consistency with local dev machines. You shouldn’t and it was stupid.
I only put a few find in myself. Most was pulled from a few other source, the best source was from Gary C. Kessler's file signature page [https://www.garykessler.net/library/file\_sigs.html](https://www.garykessler.net/library/file_sigs.html) that he gracious gave permission to use.
https://github.com/mido/mido is very good IMO. If you want a higher abstraction level https://github.com/craffel/pretty-midi can be good to look into too.
Agreed. The most common use of indexes I see in my students' code is usually an attempt to mimic C-style index-based `for` loops out of habit and not an actual need for indexes. The [article on looping](https://treyhunner.com/2016/04/how-to-loop-with-indexes-in-python/) I link to notes that you rarely need indexes, but I may stick a phrase to that end in the `enumerate` section for good measure. Thanks for noting this!
It's mildly convenient if you're making plots and graphs. Not much more to it than the convenience though. https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/matplotlib-support.html#sm
'supporting'. I thought they will fork a 'pywin32' branch and improve it or they could just do some commits, because they know their API even better, add some documentation, make better windows service implementation and etc.
Ah, makes sense. With the exceptions when I am using Python Notebook, usually for projects, I primarily use VIM and BASH. Never got the hang of using an IDE. They bloat and irritate me.
Agreed on the second arguments of both `iter` and `next` being useful. I don't use those frequently in my own code, but I have used both before. On `iter` and `next` being seperated and `next` being (strangely) before `iter`, I also felt this was a bit odd when assembling this list, but I do feel it makes sense based on the way I learned and teach these. I teach `next` before `iter` because my students often encounter `next` used on `csv.reader` objects (to grab headers before looping over data). I rarely teach `iter` in introductory classes and `next` doesn't come up often enough to explain beyond "there are some types of lazy iterables that you can `next`". In my own code, I find I use `itertools` helpers much more often than `iter` directly.
From the PEP: &gt; ###Future maintenance of removed modules &gt; The main goal of the PEP is to reduce the burden and workload on the Python core developer team. Therefore removed modules will not be maintained by the core team as separate PyPI packages. However the removed code, tests and documentation may be moved into a new git repository, so community members have a place from which they can pick up and fork code. &gt; A first draft of a legacylib repository is available on my private Github account. The modules could be made available on PyPI. The Python core team will not publish or maintain the packages.
Hi, I have a very good book about writing good, pretty code. The book helps to name variables, functions and proper writing ways. So it's easier to read later. If you want it I can send it to you. Sorry for the english I'm still learning ;-;
Fair enough.
Perhaps you could hop on python-dev and mention this. There have been revisions to this PEP from feedback.
Got a link to the change.org petition?
Perfect, that is how major version numbering should work.
It really doesn't matter. You can just install multiple versions of Python side by side. Also, /r/learnpython.
Whichever you are going to use it on most. Python is pretty much cross-platform, but there are things you sometimes need to do to take a program from Windows to Linux to Mac. Especially when you start multiprocessing and system-level modules.
Do you have version without the automatic content downloading? Because I’m obviously not gonna just give away my username/pw, even if it’s on guthub. Hell do you have a version without the facebook message interpreter? So that I can hook it up to other convo formats, such as irc chats?
Oh it’s just a markov chain, nevermind
Those modules don't go away until python 3.10, which probably won't be out until 2022. And even then python 3.9 will still be receiving security updates for a few more years. My point is you've got plenty of time.
I believe it downloads a chat you specified into RAM, and you only need to enter your username/pw when you run the script. It only works with FB Messenger chats
Really? I thought the cause was an epidemic of vowel allergy that took quite some time to eradicate.
Install termux (terminal emulator) on your phone. This package has also a apt-like package manager and can install the newest Python together with the whole scientific stuff and you can compile it also by yourself if you want. If go a bit further, you could even host on your Smartphone a Jupyter-Notebook for the whole class. The only thing which is needed, is a Wifi connection to your school network and a charger.
aw fantastic. A week after I posted my final project that requires the latest python and forced me to include an installer... this would have been handy
I just love python
I hope this is more compliant than previous approaches.
Your guess is wrong. Dictionary keys in Python can be any "hashable" item, including any string (with or without spaces), numbers, and even tuples.
I'm currently making a Discord bot to analyze our network using the PyShark wrapper for TShark and [Discord.py](https://Discord.py). It's not hard, but it's my first Discord bot, and first project that will be used by other people.
You need a button, which calls a function and this function opens the file-dialog, makes all hashes and updates all Variables of the labels. Instead of updating the widget itself, you only update the used Variables. The Label will update, if the Variable has been changed. I hope this example is good enough. from tkinter import ( Tk, Button, Label, Variable ) from tkinter.filedialog import askopenfilename from hashlib import sha256 from functools import partial BUFFER = 1*1024**2 # 1MiB chunks # works also with large files # data is read in chunks to save memory def make_hash(tk_variable): """ Show the file dialog to open any type of file. Then this file is read in 1MiB sized chunks to calculate the hash. Result is set in tk_variable """ file = askopenfilename() hasher = sha256() with open(file, 'rb') as fd: for chunk in iter(partial(fd.read, BUFFER), b''): hasher.update(chunk) result = hasher.hexdigest() tk_variable.set(result) # the same without chunks def make_hash(tk_variable): """ Show the file dialog to open any type of file. Then read the whole file and calculate the hash. This is not memory efficient. Reading big files may raise a MemoryError. Result is set in tk_variable """ file = askopenfilename() with open(file, 'rb') as fd: data = fd.read() result = sha256(data).hexdigest() tk_variable.set(result) root = Tk() hexdigest = Variable(root) hexdigest.set('-- open a file --') # here the function make_hash is called, when pushing the button # partial is used to submit one argument to the function make_hash Button(root, text='Open File', command=partial(make_hash, hexdigest)).pack() # instead you can use also lambda # Button(root, text='Open', command=lambda: make_hash(hexdigest)).pack() Label(root, textvariable=hexdigest).pack() Button(root, text='Close', command=root.destroy).pack() root.mainloop()
Pythonista, available in the app store. mobile phones aren't my favorite platform to work in python, but it fits into my pocket, and Pythoniosta is somewhat better than the Android equivalent, Pydroid 3.
I think it's just a matter of confidence. You, as the author, have a strong understanding of the risks, whereas I, as a user, will probably never have a precise understanding on how the framework operates internally. That's why I need to rely on the authors' confidence to tell if their project is mature enough to be used in production. If the authors are not confident enough to classify their project as production ready, then I don't feel confident enough to use it in production. But I don't feel like this is a bad thing, that just mean I trust the authors. On the other hand, I totally agree that usage is a good metric too. But I find it harder to get a good sense of it, I can know how many people are complaining about (long lasting) issues, but it's difficult to tell how many people are using the framework in production. PS: If you consider your project production ready, then I guess you should change the status on PyPI, no? I think every project will eventually change API, and [that's what version tags tell us](https://semver.org/). If I use any version 1.x of Quart, I don't really care that versions 2.x have a different API. Maybe I'm wrong, but that's how I understand this relationship \^\^.
I think this makes python look really bad from a corporate perspective. The non-technical argument for python3 boiled down to 3 is the future, 3 is supported, 2 is dead. Corporate users with existing codebases understandably dragged their heels on that, because it wasn't offering some obvious benefit in their use case. If they didn't have (or weren't aware of) unicode issues with python 2, they didn't need python 3 to save them. So now as the last remaining holdouts have finally given up and migrated their code to python 3, what do the python devs want to do? Introduce breaking changes into the standard library and remove support for old libraries. It hardly matters that these libraries are infrequently used, the message it sends is just awful. People are going to hear about it and conclude that you can't take the python devs at their word and can't trust them to actually support python 3 like they promised. That is going to make it harder for python devs to get the support they need from management in the future.
They misspelled "installed via the malware".
Okidoki.
What OS is this? Simplest thing first: check file permissions. Next, If the files are really still open, then there's a running process. Reboot, and try to delete. If you can't reboot, try lsof (Linux) or Systools process explorer (Windows) to identify the process, and kill it.
So much why. Why is your url not already encoded as a string by the time you need to test it? Why not use `if submission.url.endswith('.jpg'):` or even better yet, something like: `if submission.headers.get("Content Type") == "image/jpeg"`
True. It is somehow the best social media platform for both answers and negativity. My favorite subreddit is marine biology: all answers, no negativity. Share a photo of marine life, and someone will quickly reply with a correct identification. But, call Python "easy" in this group... wow!
&gt; The best part - all you need to run the script is two python packages and your FB username/password! No downloading of FB data required. That's not the best part, that's the worst part. Even if its open-source, everyone will prefer data download over giving out their password.
Ah, OK, that makes a bit of sense then. Though of course my point still stands; if they want to see how you deal with other people's code, then an open source portfolio is only one of several ways of checking that. And just putting your personal projects on github wouldn't have helped that particular goal anyway. If I wanted to judge someone's ability to cooperate on a codebase, I would either just ask them whether they had worked with someone else's code in any way, and if so, ask them to talk about that - what difficulties did you encounter, how did you tackle those, what was the experience like, etc. I might also hand the candidate a code sample from our own codebase and ask them some questions about it: what do you think this code does, what is good about it in your opinion, what is not so good, how would you improve it, etc. Maybe even ask them how they would go about adding a particular feature to it. And if things get more serious, I might invite the candidate to join the team for a day (and offer to pay them for it), so that they can actually work on the real thing with the real team. If that doesn't answer those questions, then I don't know what does.
Maybe I should’ve worded it differently. You only need to enter your personal info when you run the actual script so fbchat can log you in
My Python script this week is being used to check on bootup if the machine has QuickBooks installed on it. If it does it then checks the .ini file and makes sure the default is set to multi-user mode and if not corrects it. No more users logging in to QB in single user and locking everyone else out.
I like it in WSL!
It's 42 lines of open source code. You can clearly see that it's not doing anything malicious with your info.
It only needs your username and password !
The two big problems are (1) this requires you to store your facebook password in plaintext on your computer (e.g., unless using full disk encryption anyone with physical access can get it; e.g., boot your computer to a live cd, mount your hard drive, and steal said password) and (2) this requires you reviewing all the current source code of `fbchat` to make sure nothing nefarious is going on (like an attacker puts a fix that has a network request that sends your username/password somewhere).
Yes
If you just do straight numerical computing, numpy is the best tool. If you work with structured data, pandas will change your life! For example, Pandas query is so much easier to write and understand than chained np.logical_and statements!
Why not just use Power BI? Have users download the desktop version for free.

Doc strings and comments are different things. There are no doc strings for dict literals. There are actually quite a few things in python that it would be nice to be able to put docstrings on.
It's not just 42 lines of code. It relies `fbchat` (which expects username and password) which is about 4000 lines of python code in 22 files. Plus `fbchat` has several dependencies that also need to be checked.

I hope in the future that they remove warts as they go against the Zen of Python: - Readability counts. (`sndhdr` -&gt; `sendheader`; yes it is in the PEP but I'm sure there are others) - There should be one—and preferably only one—obvious way to do it. (`defaultdict` -&gt; `DefaultDict`; is it a function or a class) - Simple is better than complex. (`unittest` -&gt; `pytest`; the former doesn't feel like Python at all)
"What is the most beautiful function you've written in Lisp?"
One of the most essential skills you will need as a coder is to be able to figure out what your program is doing when it's not doing what you want/expect. I think of this as kind of a puzzle/problem-solving-game, called "debugging". One simple way to get started learning about debugging is the time-honored method of adding "print()" statements to your code in various places to check if your assumptions are correct about what your code is doing. After you fix the bug you can remove the print statements, and pretend the bug never happened. Here are a couple of hints: 1. Your line &lt;code&gt;fhand = fhand.readlines()&lt;/code&gt; could be confusing and cause you problems later. It would be better as "file_lines = fhand.readlines()", where you create a new variable to hold the lines, with a new non-confusing variable name. That way the value of "fhand" never changes. It starts out being a file handle and it remains a file handle throughout the program. In Python, especially as a beginner, it is better to create a new variable for almost everything, and don't "re-use" variables for other things. 2. Your code: for line in fhand: line = line.strip() doesn't really do anything. The stripped lines are just getting thrown away, and you only end up with the last one at the end of the loop. It should really be something like this (also using my first suggestion): stripped_lines = list() for line in file_lines: stripped_lines.append(line.strip())
fbchat is clearly a fairly popular module. It's been on github for 2+ years and has extensive documentation. Do you think the devs are stupid enough to throw all that effort away just to steal your worthless FB account? If you want to be paranoid you can still read all the code. You could probably look through 4k lines in less than half an hour.
It's not about someone necessarily using it, it's about the development experience.
Oh, gotch ya! Makes sense! Good luck!

Yes.
Thanks for outlining that. I'm just a software student and made this for fun. The thought of someone stealing the physical data never crossed my mind, and is definitely something that should be considered. I've seen/used many other scripts that use `getpass` to store a pass, so this script is only for people who are comfortable having the pass grabbed/stored that way. I also assumed that `fbchat` isn't malicious, as it's pretty popular open-source code.
All this does is leverage the existing [App Execution Alias](https://www.windowscentral.com/how-manage-app-execution-aliases-windows-10) functionality in Win10. There is no way shipping Python by default would be easier than this.

Just because your OS uses 2.6 doesn’t mean *you* need to use 2.6. Don’t think of “python” as a traditional “program” like you would Microsoft Word. Think of it like a family with multiple cars (in this case a car is python). You need the truck to pick up big things for the house, but you can use the Ferrari to go out on that date with your coworker that’s way hotter than your significant other, and the Volvo in the morning to take your kid you had with the one you settled on marriage with. You probably shouldn’t ever take out the rusty Toyota with 276k miles on it that you have to start with a screwdriver and the brakes don’t really work. That’s Python 2.6.
Oh, sorry. Apologies. I'd forgotten I had to buy that. I'd skip a week of lunches (well, three days) to buy it if I hadn't already.
Haha its fine I will just wait till I’m home next week to program.
It's more of a "we have to start doing something or we will loose even more developers in favour of MacOS and Linux!" Windows is such a useless toy for kids it's laughable if you want to do anything serious.
There are cases where backwards compatibility can and should be broken. I think you give some good examples. Type erasure in Java might actually be worth the pain of refactoring code in terms of what is gained. Similarly a python version that didn't have a GIL and had a sensible and usable parallel processing system other than the absolute dog-shit we currently have, would be something I would jump at in a heart beat. The difference here is that none of these libraries removals seem to offer big gains like those two. They aren't impediments to doing anything, they aren't limiting the core language, they are just a few kilobytes of files on disk that very few people ever access.
It can only be 3 lines of pure Python, people are discussing about the principle. Downloading data from Facebook (or providing a script that does this easily but requires login info, use at own risk) would make the whole code risk free.

This was already posted, and it result wasn't that funny the first time.
Good one. I've come to mostly the same conclusions as that person, specifically about pathlib. I consider banning `os.path` and `open` in my projects’ style guides. I think I'd only move getattr and next up the priority ladder. The former is useful for duck typing and the latter is useful if you want “the first item of a generator or None if the generator is empty”, a surprisingly common task.

If someone has physical access to your machine, you're fucked anyway no matter what encryption you have. Security isn't binary secure/not secure. It's a spectrum that heavily depends on user requirements. The scenarios you've suggested simply aren't realistic unless you specifically are being targeted, in which case you're fucked anyway.
I don't think there is one.
Thanks for sharing langarus! Job is a job for sure. Can't escape that. What do you recommend someone in like me to do? Just wanted to hear your insight! :D
I think the logic here is probably related to security concerns that I completely disagree with on a fundamental level.
It's good that you can recognize this. Just as a note, you should *always* assume people will be nefarious and try to steal stuff honestly :P
The `imp` module is the only one that seems a little risky in term of breaking backward-compatibility, but afterall if you are moving to Python3, you have to get the change and refactor your code with the newest option in the stdlib.
How the fuck do you debug anything?
First of all, as you're learning something new, it's great that you have some financial stability, hold on to that, until you have other serious opportunities in programming. &amp;#x200B; Second of all, make sure you'll end up developing an employable skill. It's easy to do just what you like, without there being a market for it. You should look for job opportunities in your area. I'll be honest, overall, in programming (in my area), most jobs are in web-dev. &amp;#x200B; Thirdly, work on projects to show to your employer. Many are willing to hire, if you can prove skill. &amp;#x200B; So to make a short summary: look for what job opportunities are there (in junior positions), and think about what are you willing to get up in the morning even if you're gonna have a rough day.

Hi, there are already LKH wrappers available, as far as I know. A part of my thesis (warehouse logistics) was implementing various TSP algorithms. [https://github.com/BraveDistribution/pytsp](https://github.com/BraveDistribution/pytsp) I published the source code on github (2-opt, 3-opt, Simulated Annealing, Permutations, not efficient Branch &amp; Bound, Christofides &amp; NN). Algorithms work mainly for symmetric TSP (and the parameter is 2d numpy array - distance matrix). &amp;#x200B; Feel free to check it :). The source quality is not really high (because 1. I am Java developer, 2. I had no time to code it up to high standards).
This PEP is fundamentally flawed. Ignoring for a moment that PyPI is not a valid solution to dead batteries in the batteries included model, but this is fundamentally flawed in that it contradicts itself. It claims this feat is both easy to live with but that using PyPI in some cases is difficult. Now going over the modules themselves, the following, IMO at least, should not be removed. Some code is indeed "dead code", but there's nothing to improve upon. In other cases such batteries are required. * **aifc, audioop** These are used in a variety of industries. Removing these would be a mistake, not to mention the fact that these would not be posted to PyPI but require now 3rd party maintainers. opening up people to make requests which do not need to exist. * **cgi, cgitb** No, no no! These modules are fundamental for simple, quick web applications that don't need much maintenence. Using something like flask, bottle, django, pylons, pyramid, and so on, would be overkill at best and the equivalent of using a supernova to power a smartphone at worst. * **nntplib** Specialization != lack of use. I am more than sure that this is still used in relevant sectors. If the issue really is the tests, then end up fixing them by mocking out the server. * **crypt** should only be removed if relevant functionality is moved to `hashlib`. The PEP doesn't make deprecated use clear. * **msilib** Pure contradiction. MS is "moving away" from MSI, but the second sentence of the source says "MSI isn't going to go away". AppX is for new apps, but companies will remain sticklers. Hell, I literally installed an MSI just today. * **pipes** There is 0 reason to remove a low-level, minor module, without providing that in `os` or `subprocess`. However * **getopt, optparse** whatever you do, do not get rid of these. While argparse is great, many C developers see Python as a C wrapper, and it is commonly used as such. Furthermore, the plan for outsourcing the work is assinine. The way as proposed will cause too much friction. Relevant experts (or just a placeholder core dev) should be chosen as owner in both github and PyPI, handing off the work to a (vetted) volunteer.
as the bot has told you before, this kind of question is better suited for /r/learnpython But for anyone to give you a useful answer, you'll also need to read the rules on the sidebar/wiki. I want to emphasize that you should say what operating system you're on as well
&gt; If someone has physical access to your machine, you're fucked anyway no matter what encryption you have. Security isn't binary secure/not secure. It's a spectrum that heavily depends on user requirements. Security isn't binary -- it's a process and you strive to do it better. Applications that store passwords in plaintext config files on user's machines is universally looked down on as a bad idea. Session tokens, prompts for password when you start it up, OAuth, etc. are significantly safer options. And while facebook passwords may not be a big threat, I'm sure if you captured enough of them you would be able to find significant password reuse (e.g., with email account) and escalate to more dangerous accounts. People maliciously injecting bad software into open source systems exist. E.g., last November npm had a common application (`event-stream`) get hacked when a maintainer took over an mostly abandoned project, introduced a new dependency, published a bad minimized source for that dependency, and stole bitcoin wallets of users. * https://medium.com/intrinsic/compromised-npm-package-event-stream-d47d08605502 * https://hackernoon.com/im-harvesting-credit-card-numbers-and-passwords-from-your-site-here-s-how-9a8cb347c5b5 (Yes these are JS/npm not python examples; but the general principle of third-party software is the same even if the parts about running in a browser/CSP are different.)
What library is it if you don't mind my asking?
This sounds like something that is *not* going to end well.
Lose arr and just check each element as it's generated. This'll allow you to do everything in 1 loop.
Your requirements definitely want asyncio
just go where .py file is then either through terminal or cmd enter &amp;#x200B; python3 [filename.py](https://filename.py) or python filename.py
I like this PEP, but I think it should go even further, and remove the standard library altogether, and hosting it all on PyPI. Keeping just the interpreter would allow for a very optimized binary for python, without all the bloat from the standard lib. Just like anaconda, python could come bundled with the standard lib, so that the folks that care about it don't need to change their habits, and those who need that extra level of optimization have the option.
Everything is a markov chain
And if statements
Yeah but it connects to he internet. To facebook, but also to who knows where else. And I’m not gonna manually inspect the libraries.

&gt; Also not unlike `getattr`, `next()` can take a default value which it will yield (instead of raising `StopIteration`) when reaching the end of an iterator. Which is why I use both sometimes. `getattr` for duck typing checks, and `next` for this: found = next((f(x) for x in y if pred(x)), None)

Building and exploring word embeddings to help classify text this week. Last week I built a large test matrix, (running it proved to be more time intensive than I expected) so this week I'm going to see how useful it is and if I can reduce it to lower dimensions to fit in the raspberry pi memory. It took a full day to build and is 1k times smaller than what I was planning on so either it's good enough as is, some work needs to be done in optimization, or it needs to be redone entirely. I'm hoping option one is true.
I see a lot of comments here giving OP a hard time for requiring your FB username/password to run the app. Could he possibly implement oAuth with FB as the iDP to do the same thing with an oAuth token instead of plaintext username/password?

Hm perhaps an odd one, but, I've been working on my programming language [Mamba](https://github.com/JSAbrahams/mamba), which transpiles down to Python. But it has some features such as null and type safety, and hopefully someday some cool type refinement features, pure functions, and pattern matching. The actual transpiler itself is written in [Rust](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust) though.
&gt;The difference here is that none of these libraries removals seem to offer big gains like those two. Yeah. That said, I wouldn't mind these library removals at all if they for example moved these functions out of the python standard library to say a "python extended library" or something that wouldn't be installed by default (or you were given an option when installing python), but would be maintained by python core team and could be easily installed via pip or similar. (It's not like most of these stagnant rarely-used modules would need much effort to maintain.) Or if they made an option for a lightweight version of python that had the bare minimum set of modules and you had to use pip or similar to install every module.
&gt; because it wasn't offering some obvious benefit in their use case You say this. But there were plenty of obvious beneficial improvements in the Python 3 series years ago. The "corporate users" you're talking about really are shops with an absolute hard-line policy of never allowing maintenance work on their codebases, ever. The kinds of places where it's not directly solving a ticket from a customer or from the sales department, it's off-limits. And they operate on a philosophy of "why do maintenance if it's working correctly today", not understanding that the answer is "to make sure it will still be working correctly next quarter". Every tired old excuse -- it's too hard, we weren't given enough time, there wasn't a compelling reason to do it -- is just that. An excuse. An excuse to cover for a shortsighted culture of refusing to maintain what has been built (which, yes, does involve things like getting the underlying software up to date at least once per decade or so). Will those folks have a new excuse to blame in lieu of their own poor engineering culture? Sure, but they were going to come up with a new excuse no matter what the Python core team did. This is just the easiest excuse currently available, so it's the one they'll jump on. And you're enabling them.
Well, that might work for some people. It would certainly be insanely impractical for the code I'm working on.
Yes, that was on my mind. However that is highly ironic in the context of a post about "removing dead batteries from stdlib". Having non-PEP8 compliant unittest out of the box pushes the needles significantly towards "dead battery".
I agree not everyone can use pypi, but you did manage to install python. I'd be in favor of this proposal, if the python team still maintained these ex-standard library modules and had an easy to install option (released by them) to install everyone of these deprecated modules. That is, yeah, it's hard to get your security team to approve of random code pushed onto PyPI by someone who you've never heard of; but on the other hand if you can install python on your machine by trusting releases from python.org, why can't you similarly install a set of packages taken from python.org for modules that used to be in the standard library, but are now in the "extended library" or whatever. (Or you have to choose an alternate download to install python that has extended libraries built in or something).
unittest is still heavily used by CPython itself, and pytest's reliance on "magic" makes it unsuitable for use in the standard library. The stdlib needs simple test machinery that's capable of testing that all that fancy pytest introspection works properly. I think we should have a PEP 8 clean-up for unittest and logging. All they need to do is add PEP 8 compliant method names, deprecate the old names for a few years, and kill them off slowly.

[This module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sunau.html) has been in the Python standard library since -- if I'm looking at the history correctly -- December of 1993. It provides utilities to read and write an audio file format that hasn't been popular since the last century, and neither the company that invented the format, nor the other company that made a type of computer where the format was popular, exist today. But every single installation of Python includes a copy of this module. Just in case you need it. Under the proposal in the PEP, that module would be removed from the standard library in Python 3.10. Python 3.8 is currently in the pipeline, and scheduled for release in October. At the usual rate of releases, Python 3.10 would probably release sometime in 2022. And it wouldn't be until sometime in 2026 that the Python core team would stop supporting the last version of Python to include the module. At that point, if someone desperately needed to read and write this file format from a Python program, they could simply grab a copy of the -- at that point, roughly 33-year-old -- module from an old version of Python's source tree, and even package it up to put on the Python Package Index. Do you think this is an OK thing to do?
PEP8 says that applying PEP8 for PEP8's sake is a bad thing. Python's `unittest` module looks weird from a PEP8 perspective because it's more or less a straight port into Python of Java's JUnit testing framework. A couple dozen other languages also have more or less faithful ports of JUnit-style testing. It's not consistent with PEP8's style recommendations, but it is consistent with other JUnit-style testing frameworks, and PEP8 says it's OK to leave an existing piece of code, that's already written in a non-PEP8 but internally-consistent style, alone and not rewrite it just to achieve some sort of stylistic purity.
As I said, I support what the linked page says about removing packages from being part of the standard library. That's pretty easy, just have to possibly list some more library requirements. My concern is about the comment I replied to, which talked of something that comes after removing those things and referred to modifying functions. Changing a bunch of function names to meet proper naming conventions would break a lot of code in a way that wouldn't be fixed as easily as making sure certain extra packages are installed. I don't know exactly what changes LightOfUriel was referring to, so I asked.

The PEP says absolutely nothing about rewriting packages in the standard library for some sort of theoretical stylistic purity. And in fact, doing that would violate Python's official style guide.

You can't just say "the PEP" when there are two very different PEP's we are talking about. I know PEP 594 doesn't say anything about this, but the comment above talked about action after PEP 594 finishes to make standard library functions consistent with PEP 8 - which is the style guide.

lol what
The comment that you are reacting to said: &gt; I hope that next step after that is PEP8 cleanup of standard library. This whole sub-thread was kicked off by reacting to someone saying "I want the Python core team do to this" as if they said "It is confirmed the Python core team will do this". I don't know why that was the reaction. All I can tell you is that the main link at the top of this post is to a PEP that proposes deprecating and, years down the road, removing some ancient unused modules in the standard library, and there is no other PEP being discussed here.
So you have no answers to the questions I asked. Someone suggested they'd like to see a certain change, I said I might not like that change and asked if anyone knew if there were actually plans to do it.
Do it anyway. For Science.
didn't see your mom's number in the apple script - what is?
911
This is an impossible question to answer, though. There's an episode of "The West Wing" where the press secretary gets trapped by a reporter who keeps asking her if the President has considered taking a certain action, and all she can truthfully say is not that she's aware of. The reporter gets her to commit to asking the President if he's considered it, and that's the trap, because once she asks him if he's considered it, he will, technically, have considered it, if only to say "no", and then the reporter can go write his story. There are no publicly-known plans to force-rewrite the whole standard library for PEP8 style-guide compliance. As I already pointed out, doing that would actually be a horrendous violation of the style guide! But if you keep insisting that you need an absolute definitive answer, you're going to end up in the "well, the Python core team considered it, but only in the technically-true sense that they were asked about it and said no" situation. And the worst part of this is that I *know* now because of this thread, in the not-so-distant future people are going to say "Well *I* heard that they absolutely were going to do it".
Are there versions with higher zoom levels? I could only find downloads for zoom levels 0-5.
Sounds like home work. Try googling "python user input"
for the high quality tiles i think you need to pay extra
But I seriously want to get Candy Crush done how am I supposed to do that on OSX or Linux
Ah, I see. Thanks!
Traditional, C-style switches maybe. Go's switches simply don't fall through unless you're explicit, instead of the other way around. I think this is a nice way to handle switches.
You’ll also need a loop and a counter that will exit the loop once five numbers are input. You’ll probably want some user input sanity checking to make sure they’re putting in numbers and not symbols or letters.
The dead libs won’t be wiped, but rather moved to public repositories, from what I understand. So you should be able to keep using it. You might have to maintain it yourself though.
Create a fake profile, use that for testing only.
&gt; Wow, that was quick. Even if this draft were approved tomorrow, which it won’t, there would be barely time to add deprecation warnings in 3.8, the first drops would happen in 3.9, most stuff would go in 3.10 (planned for 2021, iirc). So there is plenty of time for everyone to plan. &gt; Will it just be a matter of reinstalling it with pip? I think this is still open for debate. Mostly it will depend on whether anyone is willing and able to take up maintainership and packaging duties, lib by lib. The PEP explicitly says core devs are not going to do that, so someone will have to step forward.
 [https://wiki.python.org/moin/Android](https://wiki.python.org/moin/Android) may be of some help
Other libs have been removed in 2.x, I looked it up the other day. Check the whatsnew for 2.4 and 2.6. 3.x has been a whirlwind of additions up to now, maybe it’s time to prune a few old branches if we want to keep the tree healthy. I’d rather lose old and niche libs than see the stdlib ripped out in ots entirety as certain extremists are currently suggesting.
And this is why Delphi is so hot right now, clearly.
Tell me about that apple script.
I’d love to but I am busy at the moment. Check out the readme on the GitHub page linked in a comment above! If you still need more info just let me know and I will answer later
Sure thing no worries
What if we *did* click *'add to PATH'* during installation? Are they saying that the update will interfere with an existing installation of python if the user added the PATH change, or are they saying that an existing PATH change might interfere with a new (redundant) installation through the Windows store? I'm somewhat new and just want to know if I should do anything to prepare for the update.
Harsh crowd here haha I don't know how to use vim, but somehow am able to stumble through it on a fresh Linux install. That said, pycharm is great AND you can set it up for vim "mode"
You could create a dummy account with a few mates and test it, if you are keen
This seems super interesting! Currently running it on a repo, gonna see what comes out.
what do you mean “you could”? aren’t you guys use some dummy/spam/one-time use accounts/emails and shit for situations like this all the time?
Run the model against each other and see what it means to talk to mirror-self
The python environment directory, is that supposed to be something like `/Users/me/miniconda3/envs/py37/bin`? Aka, the directory containing python?
That's the idea
Dude I was about to do this! dammit. Now I feel like I dragged my feet.
Hmm that looks like the Arduino IDE, not Python! Though he does mention Python but I think it's unrelated...
IMHO if WebDev is something you enjoy and feel confident in doing. I would learn HTML and look at the other technologies as well such as SQL (MySQL, MS SQL server, Postgres etc..) and other web languages such as Ajax and the like. I think it's wide area to look into as it bridges the gap between so many other technologies and can easily lead to other sysadmin type of capabilities or to other programming/coding style of work. Again this is me and your mileage may vary..
Yeah you're totally right. He literally says Arduino code. I'm pretty dumb
That seems nice. Unfortunately, I cannot install anything on my university lab computer, so I'm basically stuck with VIM and Bash. That said, this combination is good enough for me. IDE's are useful for C programming and other places where you need to use linkers and maintain complex projects with XML or JSON files, but I don't like it for simpler work. Maximum IDLE or jupyter.
Python: solving the problems that really matter
Could you make one to say...send pro-vaccine posts to someone? Because someone I know is antivax, and I’d love to flood her with pro-vacation posts lol
Please post your results. I want to know how this goes *grabs popcorn*
This is true for strings, but only certain characters are allowed in variable names. Generally greek letters etc are, but smilies aren't.
Yeah i don't think so, the sooner shit like this is done the better. Delaying just makes it easier for people who don't want to update their code to request *continued* delays later on, because there's a precedence.
Or grow a pair and don't answer.
This requires a Mac for the Applescript to work with iMessage, right?

"What? Why?" &amp;#x200B; "Nevermind."
I'm working on a digital assistant running on a raspberrypi. Im starting out using leon-ai and a telegram bot to remotely wake up my computer or show me security camera feeds. This is mostly as a hobby project while I pursue my computer science degree. I think it will be a good way to learn python. My eventual plan is for this assistant to have full control of my house and use machine learning to predict what my girlfriend and I may need. Along with full server integration and tracking who is in what room.
If you like building websites I suggest you learn the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node.js) which is entirely based on JavaScript. JS has become a huge phenomenon in the years since it became available on the server side so you can't go wrong with that, and if you skip JS you'll constantly find your options limited in the field of webdev. Outside of webdev you could find courses on data science and deep learning basics online, but I'm not really sure where to go from there... I assume there are more advanced courses too but I haven't come across any (although I haven't tried to find any either). You should not be discouraged for being 40, that's really not a problem today. However, I would encourage you to try to think of a problem you feel should be solved and see whether you could actually solve it, before you decide to give away your knowledge for a salary. Good luck!

genuine question: I thought `.sh` was for bash scripting, not python?
That systool thing worked! Had to manually delete like 1000 python processes though. Thanks.
depends for what. if you are planning to write something for Windows - stay on it, otherwise VM with Linux is definitely a better option. btw: Python 2.x is almost EOL.

for example, you have 2D list. Let's suppose 0 for white pixels, and 1 for black pixels will be used to fill your list. If you want to draw a circle, you have some interesting ways. You can iterate through a list, and swap zeros with 1s where you think borders of circle are. Most important part is to determine whether current zero is must be replaced with 1 (current white pixel must be swapped with black in order to get circle at the end). Did you get the idea? Everybody here i think at least did some exercises of drawing circles, squares and so on on console's screen when they began programming journey. And now, I offer to do the same think but at the end your result will be a gif, not just ugly text on your console screen. I don't know how to explain it another way
 #!/usr/bin/env python
Not inherently. It's a shell script so there's probably not just python in there.
So, even if a file ends in sh, python will still run it so long as you set the interpreter to python?
On a previous team, we had to use only the packages provided by our Linux distro vendor. Even other releases from python.org were off limits. PyPI was absolutely never going to happen. It was all about what our paid support covered.

You’re correct! Sorry that the gif is misleading. ‘run.sh’ calls a python script and an AppleScript. Check out the [GitHub](https://www.github.com/ginglis13/cat-message) to see the code for everything!
Feel free to use any of the code if you’d like!
Correct
Sure, I'd love to read it. :)
Python is used a lot of automation and scripting on the Linux / DevOps side of things. Might be something you're more interested in than code-by-the-pound web-dev. There's also web frameworks written in python. If you're already in an IT support role, and you can pick up a linux cert, python skills will go a long way to moving up in that side of the house. Naturally, since we're in r/python, I'm a fan.
&gt; I'm torn between taking Python into web development or taking a deeper dive into fundamentals and maybe deep learning or data science. My main goal is to find a path that can lead into a decent job for 15-20 years and retirement thereafter. I think you can make a career out of any of those, so I would personally just go with whichever of those options your heart desires as web development might seem boring if you'd rather be a data scientist (and vice-versa).
Currently working with pygal.StackedBar() and adding a second column with indexing. Currently I take a (processed) pandas dataframe and turn it into a dictionary with a for loop.
Unfortunately no, as it requires AppleScript, and only works on Mac. If you just want to use the python script to download the media, that should work on windows! Might just have to take out the shebang line, the first line.
That's exactly my point. Actually, Delphi people hate and loathe Python because after using Delphi for 17 years I told them I'd discovered Python and how amazing it is. Now many community bigwigs insult it whenever they can, and even the Delphi product manager commented on his blog to me that he honestly believes that Delphi has had more impact on the business world than Python ever has. So if even Delphi's standard library becomes superior to Python's thanks to this PEP, we'll never live it down and have only ourselves to blame. And here's a Java user begging for an SMTP server library "like Python". https://www.reddit.com/r/javahelp/comments/949j38/smtp_server_library_for_java/ We must not throw away our awesomeness to appease Twisted.
Wow thank you so much for the feedback! I'm going to work on the project over the next 2-3 days and go through each point you listed out. Thanks so much again.
I build one a few years ago that would randomly text people cats.. there's a cat api you can call .
The conclusion of this post leads me to believe this is some sort of manifesto
Is there a link to this api you could give me 😺

No amount of reading will replace sitting down and just writing some code.
Code that works should always be allowed to work. No one should be forced to update code because of externalities. If there's a security issue, the appropriate warnings will inform the developer, but they should also be allowed to continue using a --legacy or --insecure mode. It is a hidden TCO to open source if we need to intermittently devote resources to update code that has no other problems except maintainers who make arbitrary decisions to have things stop working.
I'd suggest using numpy+matplotlib for this. Generate (how long to run the script)/(time between points) random numbers with [numpy.random.rand](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/routines.random.html) and update the graph in real time [as described here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42024817/plotting-a-continuous-stream-of-data-with-matplotlib), so that the n-th time you update the graph, you display the first n values in your random array. Every 500 microseconds in real time might be tricky though; I'd experiment with it and see if you can get it fast enough. Good luck!
.sh means shell. The hashbang tells the shell what to run. Could be python, could be Perl. Commonly is bash.
 %matplotlib notebook import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt from collections import deque import time fig = plt.figure() ax = fig.add_subplot(111) plt.ion() fig.show() fig.canvas.draw() index = [x for x in range(100)] data_queue = deque([0 for x in range(100)], maxlen=100) while(True): num = np.random.randint(low=0, high=100) data_queue.append(num) ax.clear() ax.plot(index, list(data_queue)) fig.canvas.draw() plt.pause(0.01) time.sleep(0.01) Doesn't even hit 60fps, op's probably asking for updating the data in 500us intervals.
I thought I saw a rumor that the next version of OS X would include 3.7 as default
if your script is nested in a function, make sure you add the function call to the end of you script: def helloworld(): print('hello world') helloworld() or even better: def helloworld(): print('hello world') if __name__ == "__main__": helloworld() then open up command line (for windows) or terminal (for macbook/linux machines) and run: `python path/to/your/script.py`
"cat media" That sounds cryptic for something nefarious.

Can it be modified to send via WhatsApp?
This is quite helpful, thanks. But I need to plot say 500 data points (random numbers) per second in real time, i.e. continuously. And the sampling rate at should be configurable.
Good write-up, thanks. Been looking for something like this.
I wouldn’t be surprised if WhatsApp had an API you could use. If so, yes, it shouldn’t be too bad to modify this for WhatsApp
Ok! That makes sense. It might be nice to add an explanation on this to your documentation. It's not 100% clear to new users.
WhatsApp web is a thing so yes
I just had the same thought. Added an issue to our GitHub tracker so that we don't forget about that :) https://github.com/CoatiSoftware/SourcetrailBugTracker/issues/696
A second suggestion is to have SourceTrail print the currently used python environment in the status field (just the path to it + python version), which would make it easier for users to know they didn't screw up that setting.
I dont think you'll be able to figure out the app's hash generation method.. maybe look into something selenium to automate some task?
Make an async function that * fills up a 500 length deque with random number. * async sleeps for ( SAMPLE_RATE / 1sec ) . * encapsulated in a while loop. In main function execute the async function in a separate thread and plot the deque with plt.pause(1), assuming that the deque is under global scope and that the pause function sleeps like async.
lol
In any games-related forum I think?
The better thing you can do is to start own real projects, it could be toy ones ir more complicated. This will bring you the ability to face real problems and also you can add them to hour portfolio (your github account). It will be easier then to show interviewers what you can make and also that you are willing to learn and enhance your programming skills.
Is it built with python or just has an embedded Python interpreter?
a couple of questions: * looks like you are using a windows machine. Should your base\_image directory have back slashes instead of forward slashes? * which directory are your running your program from? If the assets directory isnt in the same location as your program, that could cause some issues. It may help to define the full file path to base.png for troubleshooting purposes.

I hope it's using a deep learning network for image recognition because if it is using image metadata, it might confuse pussy images for cats. If these are going to your mom, you better unit-test the crap out of it.
Learning one language won't necessarily make you better at another. The language you choose should really be more geared towards what kind of software you want to write
I can't speak with flask orientation. But I use pymysql when I have to connect to a MySQL db and have had a lot of success.
I shall look into it. Thank you
I was hoping for some kind of cat recognition wizardry but it’s just a list of cat subreddits :(
the 2 languages are not that related syntactically. I would call python a standalone language, whereas javascript is more of an accessory to other languages. Both python and js will teach you the basics of programming, but Python is will probably be easier to work with and has a broader range of applications. Learning javascript as a starting point may be tough if you dont have any web framework development experience. Also, Python has a few modules for building frameworks (django and flask are 2 popular ones)
Yes, one project can have multiple source groups. So if you add a C++ group that knows about your C++ files and compiler flags and one Python source group where you specify which Python files to index, Sourcetrail will have everything accessible in one database! On top of that one could even add one more source group for Java, but who would push it that far? :P
formula for success: learn the basic pricipals, read "automate the boring stuff", take on small personal projects
I ended up realising that I had a couple of bugs with my environment (conda reporting that a package has been installed, but it is not importable by python). The app certainly provides very nice schematic overview of the package. Once I've worked out the bugs I mentioned, I'll try to provide a better answer.
That sounds like harassment.
Jeez, the core developers have got way more important things to do then create a huge amount of code churn and unnecessary diffs just to satisfy style bigots who don't even understand the **most important part of PEP 8**.

Take a look at https://vi.stackexchange.com/questions/84/how-can-i-copy-text-to-the-system-clipboard-from-vim I'm on ubuntu 18.04 and when I type `:echo has('clipboard')` I get `0` This kind of nonsense is why vim gets called impractical.

Cool project. Can you add an option that the Paths are wrapped in pathlib.Path objects? Maybe you could do it like the implementation of defaultdict does. I know, this is slower, because all this instances have to be created, but it could be very handy.

Through telegram for sure... Don't know about WhatsApp, and even if there is no api, then you can use whatsapp web and selenium. ^(/Basically its possible, one way or other.)
Instead of implementing ipsort, you could use ipaddress.ip\_address and it's still faster as own implementations. The resulting objects can be converted to integer or you can sort them with sorted. def ip\_sorter(addresses): return sorted(ipaddress.ip\_address(ip) for ip in addresses) &amp;#x200B; If you want to keep them as str, you could make the same function slightly modified: &amp;#x200B; def ip\_sorter(ip): return int(ipaddress.ip\_address(ip)) &amp;#x200B; sorted(addresses, key=ip\_sorter)

Looks like Visual Studio Code. That's their default font. They just have JavaScript package add ons that auto color the code that way.

The theme looks like monokai.
File extensions are often optional for linux (or posix) file formats. Posix uses something called [magic](https://linux.die.net/man/3/libmagic) (yes really) to determine what type of file a file is. You can invoke the magic library using a program called `file` which should be installed as standard. In the case of scripts, the fact that a file is a script is determined by two things: 1. The file is marked executable 1. The file begins with the ASCII characters `#!`, called a shebang If these two conditions are met, and you try to execute the script, the program loader will run the command that follows the shebang and pass the path of the current script file as the first argument. So, you can do stuff like this: $ ls -l total 0 -rwxr-xr-x 1 gecko gecko 50 May 23 11:39 secret.rb* $ cat secret.rb #! /usr/bin/python3 print('Ha, this is Python!') $ ./secret.rb Ha, this is Python! You're not going to fool the system with your wonky file extension: $ file secret.rb secret.rb: a /usr/bin/python3 script, ASCII text executable
This is clearly sublime text.
You are a god.
I think it fails because the first number must be smaller than the second number. &amp;#x200B; If you want it to show in reverse, use \[::-1\]. &amp;#x200B; It's probably bad practice to use a large number when what you want is ''start to x'' or ''x to end''. You can use \[:x\] and \[x:\] for these.
Can you share code to us?
Make the code readable pls.. more beautiful
&gt; We must not throw away our awesomeness to appease Twisted. I absolutely agree. I think it's more of an issue of sustainability - how much does a module impact overall development, what is the burden of keeping it up to date, how long does it take to run its tests, and so on, because core manpower is a finite resource. For smtpd in particular I think the main issue is that its tests and innards rely on the "losing side" of how async support developed in Python, and would need to be significantly tweaked to move forward - both to keep it up to date and to allow for asyncore to eventually be removed. (One could argue that there shouldn't have been multiple ways to do the same thing, and one would be right, but it took a while to figure out the problem and some progress was better than no progress, back then.) I guess we'll see what core people decide.
This is well done. Thanks for sharing! &amp;#x200B; slightly related/mildly interesting: there is a [$1,000,000 prize](https://www.businessinsider.com/p-vs-np-millennium-prize-problems-2014-9) for anyone who comes up with a solution/proof for the traveling sales person problem.

[yowsup](https://github.com/tgalal/yowsup/) is Python library that might work (I haven't used it).
Its not that much even here , but some people do work for that amount of money. Im from Bosnia , so eh . I dont know really i am just in a fuzz cause i have like 2 careers to manage now. Learning to code , and finding suitable job with my current degree. Its really much of a task here , in more developed country it would be a big deal , having a law degree is a big deal but round here not so much. So eh... I hope i wont invest a year into something that wont even help me a tiny bit , i know it will open up door for other lang. to be learned fairly faster but still that will take maybe another 6-12 months . And i am really fed up with my current jobs and opportunities. So if i could start making summ around that i could easly start , getting more involved and after some time just try to go for full time...

If you only do that, it might be better if you make that second call to AppleScript with the python subprocess module. It that case there is no need for a POSIX shell on the machine it is run on (eg a Windows machine). However, since AppleScript only runs on Mac anyway, you can't run it on Windows either way. But just so you know for your next project.
Luckily comments in Python also start with a hash.
Very useful! :-)

Did you read the answer you linked above? Most distros ship a minimal version of Vim initially (depends on which version you're installing). You need to run a `sudo apt-get update` and install the latest version of Vim. This is the kind of nonsense why vim gets reputation of being difficult. People just blame everything on Vim.
Hi all! Actually I'm just learning python, it's my first week coding at all and I'm so excited! I'm trying to write some code that will create, read write files based on the keyboard input. I know it's nothing but for me, just starting coding, this seems really fun and exciting.

``` numbers = '12345' ``` Numbers is a string with 5 characters. ``` numbers[0:1000] ``` This is asking for the first 1000 characters of this containers. So for this to work you would need a string with at least 1000 characters, or a list with at least 1000 elements. What you instead want to do is probably: ``` numbers = list(range(12345)) ``` This will give you a list containing every number from [0, 1, ... 12344]. Then what you are doing will work.

I occasionally wonder... is video or text the preferred strategy for tutorials? you can copy and paste, and read written tutorial in an open space. You can also glance and skip things that you already know. A video is faster, but you can't do all these things. Opinions?
Unfortunately the WhatsApp web protocol has to do this weird matching to your phone through a QR code, not sure how you would get around that programmatically. It's not like iMessage where you just need to give the app a config with your Apple account credentials
Yeah but if you have already linked it once you don't need to do the qr code thing I think

What's wrong with Blender?
That's cool. Does it use one of the existing image to ASCII libraries or did you write your own?
You can 'trick' reddit by supplying a user-agent to your request's headers, which makes reddit think you program is a real person. In my case, i did this with ``` headers = {'user-agent': 'reddit-{}'.format(os.environ.get('USER', 'cse-20289-sp19'))} response = requests.get(url, headers=headers).json() ```
Blender is so much more than just visualization. I don't need all the modeling and rendering and editing features for this very purpose. That's what I meant by additional footprint.

I worked on something similar when I was importing a processed CSV file then exporting data from that csv and comparing it to a previous csv. Ultimately I ended up importing them all into a SQLlite DB and just querying that. Dunno if that will help you but it worked for me. Really depends on the amount of effort you want to put into it.
Wow this is really cool. I myself wanted to code something similar and now i'm starting to understand how! Thanks for sharing this OP! Food for thought!

Looking at automating some arbitrage?
Why not \`while True\` for endless loop?
Yes the variable "numbers" has 5 strings. However when I call numbers[0:1000] it returns the string '12345' while numbers[1000] generates a "string out of index" error. I don't quite comprehend the reason behind it. Is there any difference between the codes: numbers[1000] and numbers[0:1000]?
I was planning on doing that actually. I lost interest a few weeks ago but I plan on starting it again soon. Just a simple tun based combat mini RPG.
Yes I was actually trying to generate a reversed version of the string '12345'. I played around and tried to call numbers[1000] and I was surprised that it returned an error but when I tried numbers[0:1000] it returned the string '12345' instead. Is there any difference between numbers[1000] and numbers[0:1000]?
You can highlight them and comment on medium. That way both you and author will benefit.
There shouldn't be a space between `.` and `\Desktop\`. This doesn't really have anything to do with Python, though, it would make more sense to ask help in a Powershell forum in the future.
No, was just to record price history and use it for a little site im working on, plan to have it running as a service on my ubuntu server, just recording everything, not into arbitrage betting.
Becauss you typed space inbetween the dot and the direction it is taken as two different arguments. You should try it without the space. Tip: press Tab to autocomplete commands Hope this helps!
Looks like (neo)vim with the monokai theme.
Numbers[1000] accesses the thousandth element which doesnt exist and therefore fails. Numbers[0:1000] grabs everything up to but not including the thousandth element. I guess python allows you to slice up to a non existent element and still work. I havent tested this myself as im on the phone now.
the problem is the app is vulnerable to boting as it has no captcha while the webpage is protected by captcha. There's a working bot, so there must be some way.
There should be one and preferably only one way to do it.
This is really good!
numbers\[1000\] is referring to the 1001st item in the string. &amp;#x200B; numbers\[0:1000\] is referring to all items 0th to 1001st in the string.
So cool. Can u share me some keywords to create this? Thank you!
Cool, a blog post with no code just saying 'i did something'. I found lots of value in this.
You'd have 2 separate downloads, one with just the interpreter, and one with the standard library. That way, on systems where space is of the essence, you could install just what is necessary, like select modules from the standard lib as you need them, but you still have the option to download the standard library python release for other needs. You get literally the best of both worlds.
Yeah, and looking at the list of stuff getting trashed, some of it is still pretty useful. uuencoding might not be commonplace any more, but it is definitely still around in legacy systems. Trashing support for it seems a bit much, when I can't imagine it's a huge maintenance burden to carry forward. It's not like the spec has changed lately.
Pros: nice summary of 6 options, with some interesting details about how and when each run Python code. Cons: obviously biased because the author emphasizes the solution they use. Skulpt, which does have some very good points, is basically Python 2 in the browser. Most (all?) of the others are supporting Python 3. - - - I have used Brython for parts of a non-trivial application (https://reeborg.ca/reeborg.html). From the description given in that article, you might conclude that Skulpt includes the standard library but Brython does not. That is incorrect: Brython does too. In 2015, Brython was faster than pypy.js, itself faster than Skulpt. (https://brythonista.wordpress.com/2015/03/28/comparing-the-speed-of-cpython-brython-skulpt-and-pypy-js/) Now, Brython's speed is roughly on par with CPython (https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/ac62sp/brython370_released/) and, I believe, is essentially compatible with Python 3.7. While I have used Brython successfully, I believe that the future will belong with programs that are baked-in the browser, like Mozilla's experiment.
There are better ways
what have you brought upon this holy land
I'm legally blind and seeing most lecture videos is almost impossible. For example, a 'normal' webpage I zoom to 400-maxzoom% even on a large monitor screen. So, I much prefer written material.
I used imports from math and numpy and the Image library from PILLOW. PILLOW has a great library for image handling and that's a great place to start.
A gift
I see what you did there.
IMHO, it depends. If you need to pick up some concepts, but not an in-depth dive in, then video would be a faster route. Just as an example, for Flask, you need a quick overview of Jinja or Alembic, you can quickly pickup that via video tutorials. For everything else, text is the "King".
Agreed. Will watching it on larger screen like a TV, helps?
&gt; Code that works should always be allowed to work... but they should also be allowed to continue using a --legacy or --insecure mode. Hold up, people _actually_ believe this? Who is upvoting this nonsense? Come on. I think it's perfectly reasonable to expect your code to work for an extended (years? a decade?) period of time but _always_ is patently ridiculous. If you want your code to work _indefinitely_ without any changes (we call this _legacy code_), keep an old version of Python. Making improvements to _any_ language and its libraries sometimes requires breaking changes. Just because you can't/won't update your code to behave with changes in the runtime doesn't mean the rest of us should wait for improvements.
Except for those linux versions that have Python pre-installed of course.

Agreed, but that kind of annoyance of integrating all those technologies is exactly where many opportunities lie. IMO it will become a standers practice in the near future to have dedicated or contractors supporting for all manner of business functions for almost any size company in the form of web applications. So being able to layout a path to produce a web application or join a team to add more functionality to an existing one is where you will stay relevant and valued. My current approach is to take data and use python to ETL it to a Postgres DB (and then I may also create “derivative”tables that aggregate or summarize or join data with other sources). Then I build interactive web pages using DataTables and Highcharts for tables and charts. It’s taken me a good two years to get some semblance of order for this “stack” but it’s worth it. My next step is to look at frameworks, but I may not need that much overhead. You’ve got to find a way to let people engage with data through intuitive visualizations or through interactions like zooming, filtering, tool tips, etc. IMO, the web is the best way to deliver something like that to an end user. Easier end user experience means more developer pain, but that’s what the money is for.

Cool demo. One problem is that the browser becomes unresponsive while processing. You could probably work around that by using web workers. [https://github.com/iodide-project/pyodide/blob/master/docs/using\_pyodide\_from\_webworker.md](https://github.com/iodide-project/pyodide/blob/master/docs/using_pyodide_from_webworker.md)
This kind of shit triggers me. That's like one of the easiest games you can make in Python. A 7 year old or maybe even a younger kid could do that. "(I'm 13)" Dude, nobody cares. There is a million other 13 year old coders and you are nothing special. Congrats on internet points. Don't know why people upvote this shit.

You're a bit late mate..
14 days isn't late in my book
You've set a tab as the separator while it should be a comma. You can remove that parameter altogether since a comma is the default separator.
You type of person turning up 14 days late to something?
Dude this is reddit.
The length of a note is not part of a midi file. The easy way to find out a note length is to record the time of the note on, keep track of the events after it and their time until the corresponding note off. You will then know the duration of the note.
Changing your input logic to construct a dictionary which could then be passed as \*\*kwargs to find\_all would be one approach. &amp;#x200B; Who's the intended consumer of this program? Letting the user input arbitrary code is generally a good way to break things or have security issues. &amp;#x200B; Lastly, /r/learnpython is a better place to ask this kind of question.
IIRC bs4 takes a dict with html attributes to match.. so you can do something like dict_key=input("enter html attribute to match") dict_value=re.compile(input("enter regex to match ")) then do soup.find_all(userinput,{dict_key:dict_value})
All good points =)
I'll make sue to do so. Also thank you!
Well you said 14 days isn't late in your book..
That is correct. But I didn't say that It applies to everywhere, just in reddit. My apologies for not being specific.
Well the post is dead now.. so it's still bit late
And do I care? No.
Oooo.. you're hard

Yeah, that's it. It's not fun but one needs to track note-ons/offs like you said.
You won't find a python library for that. You'll have to use either: Blender (python scriptable), a game engine library, opengl itself (code your own engine), or some standalone program that probably doesn't use python
# Top 10 reason , why i want to learn programming.
If you solve them in polynomial time.
Except, of course, the system python is the wrong version. My system python is 3.5 or something, but the project I am working on has f-strings. So I need the latest. So I `apt-get python3.7` right? No, that version is not in the os repos. At this point the right choice would be to get deadsnakes ppa added to apt, and i'm good to go. But I have no idea what deadsnakes is, and barely know what a ppa is. So instead I go to python.org. And click "Download Python 3.7.3". Had this been Windows I would have gotten a double-clickable installer. Because it's linux I get a tarball full of source code. Ok I'm a programmer I can handle that. `./configure &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make install` (except I should have done `altinstall` to avoid the risk of overwriting the system python. oh well.). Of course, that does not work. I need the *-dev packages for several things. Well Fine. I figured it out. Except I hadn't, because some requirements are "optional". You can compile and run python with out them. And it works just fine until several months later, when I'm using a library that does `import bz2`. I don't have a _bz2, because I didn't compile python with all the optional requirements. Now I learned about deadsnakes and the right way to install specific python versions. So I would like to uninstall the broken python version and start over. There is no `make uninstall`. At this point I just burned down my VM and started over. It took less time to regenerate then I had spent fucking around already.
YMMV

You can name a file extensiondont.matter and as long as you chmod + x it, it will be interpreted as an executable file. Likewise you could run "python extensionsdont.matter" and it will interpret that as a python script. Linux is outrageously forgiving in these matters.
Hi there, from the /r/Python mods. We have removed this post as it is not suited to the /r/Python subreddit proper, however it should be very appropriate for our sister subreddit /r/LearnPython or for the r/Python discord: https://discord.gg/3Abzge7. The reason for the removal is that /r/Python is dedicated to discussion of Python news, projects, uses and debates. It is not designed to act as Q&amp;A or FAQ board. The regular community is not a fan of "how do I..." questions, so you will not get the best responses over here. On /r/LearnPython the community and the r/Python discord are actively expecting questions and are looking to help. You can expect far more understanding, encouraging and insightful responses over there. **No matter what level of question you have, if you are looking for help with Python, you should get good answers**. Make sure to check out the rules for both places. Warm regards, and best of luck with your Pythoneering!

The first tip I will give you if you are learning to program: learn to help yourself first. ALWAYS google a question first. People will not be very enthusiastic about helping to answer a question that can be easily googled. Learning how to search well is probably the #1 most valuable skill as a programmer (seriously).

Thank you. That is very helpful. It makes sense. Who would you say offers the best courses for beginners? Udemy? Code academy? YouTube? I don't mind paying if it will prove useful.
Thank you for your input. Mistakenly typed Corey sharer. Was confused at first.
Personally, I much prefer physical books over videos, even for learning to program. Sorry I don't have any recommendations though, I have long forgotten how it feels to be a beginner and my recommendations may be terrible for someone first starting. Other beginners will have better input there.

Im assuming this is your first time, and if so, you want to learn programming, not python. &amp;#x200B; Start with variables and data types, then loops, then functions, these are the basics that apply to all programming languages. &amp;#x200B; If you are serious, the CS50 harvard course is excellent, great lectures all on youtube and the best online course for serious beginners. Its very challenging but if you are willing to put the effort in you will learn quickly a good foundation but you will need determination. Its starts on C then moves onto Python, then web stuff. At first it caters to the absolute beginner to get you in the door but you will soon find out how much you really want to learn.

Import numpy, scipy, matplotlib, CV2 and keras is way easier.. anyway importing a single module requires extensive reading to use it correctly.
Surely Pandas offers a way to specify the field separator or perhaps even a fixed width format importer.
Maybe not particularly for this use case but I thought there might have been something like pygame that could render all sorts of rigged meshes.
By the way, it seems that most of the render time is taken up by drawing the ceiling and floor. Which is not really surprising because there every pixel has to be perspective mapped, whereas the wall columns are simple to draw once the distance to the wall is known (only has to be done once per column)

Tuples (apperently) can be ran faster than lists, though they can't be changed.
Are you already pretty well familiar with python's async syntax and structures and limitations? &amp;#x200B; I ask because I don't think I'd choose Python for a websocket application. I've written an asynchronous python backend, and while it's possible, I found it more difficult than it would be in a language with better support, such as JS.

The rule of thumb I heard was use lists when the data type is the same and use tuples when it's a collection of arbitrary data.
&gt; What are the pros and cons of using tuples instead of lists. Any thoughts welcome! Functional programming built around immutable / persistent data structures will tend to have structurally shared sequences. The humble linked list is one if limited: if you prepend to a list, the tail is shared with the original, that makes it very efficient to prepend. An alternative flexible version is [building on rrb-trees](https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/213452/files/rrbvector.pdf). `tuple` is not that. `tuple` is a list without the mutable bits. That means it has the access performance and overhead of a list, but it also means any time you append or prepend you're copying *the entire source tuple*, which is not fast, and it's pretty easy to fall into accidentally quadratic behaviour. Also there's no tuple comprehension, though the syntactic overhead of wrapping a `tuple()` call around a gencomp is not a huge killer. The pros is that you have no shareable mutable state. That's about it.

Writing a GUI program to plot the different biophysical data that I generate straight from the CSVs saved on the spectrometers. I got tired of having to do the same things over and over again in excel or origin and didn't want to learn how to do it automatically in either (and somethings that could only be done in one or the other) so decided to make my own python program. I have it plotting different titrations and doing lots of different curve fitting functions from the data already.
I plan on uploading to my GitHub later today
Share the code so we can take a look at it!
Imho Flask socket but if the goal is low latency it's better to make some tests in this direction. Obviously you had to use Python for the backend (the sensors) and js for the client.
I think Flask socketio could be a solution. Obviously for the backend.
Cheers. Is the rrb vector the same as a trie? A cursory Google didn't answer the question for me, but it looks like a trie! I quite often would use generator expressions to map, filter, map and filter and map and accumulate and aggregate, and group by etc before materialising to a list that i then don't touch again (unless i map filter and accumulate again etc). I may be going over the top, but I'm not feeling that there's much benefit to materialising to a tuple instead of a list! A list may not be immutable, but if i don't mutate it, who cares!
My friend and I wrote python package with similar functionality. Check it out here [PyAscii](https://github.com/zhoudaxia233/PyAscii)

Hey, that's really cool. Can you give me a few tips on how to do this with gifs? I made [my own version of this project](https://github.com/purrleterian/Image-to-ASCII-art-converter) a few months ago, but it only works with pictures. I tried to implement video, but couldn't do it.
thankuou that helped alot :)
I just did this on my Mac and it's a shocking upgrade in terms of performance.
Pissing on a spark plug wouldn't do anything unless it was hooked up 🤔

It looks like his job consists of looking up professional laboratory information with Google Earth and plugging/unplugging USB devices. Where do I sign up?
SPITZENSPARKSEN!
Read a professional book. I am reading at the Moment one, 8% read of it, and improved my speed &amp; understanding of my own Code. Doesnt Matter what language it is, not python specific i mean.
does that website provides solutions to the problem
Lucky you, my work has py.exe blocked
Just look at the web site! ;)
Nice background.
Regex FTW
I dont know enough to know if this is a joke or not
So close
Thanks. This is really encouraging.
Interesting game, the only winning move is not to play.
Not a joke. I think they made a whitelist for programs and also uninstalled python (it used to be on the machines).
Why does each pixel need to be perspective mapped every frame when the textures are not? textures for them also?
I recently got a dell r710, stuck a hypervisor on it. Now I run win3.1, 98, ME, NT, xp, amongst some modern OS I use for work. 95 is next on the list. It was fun using the older OS again.
Pissing on anything that has power going through it does nothing. Unless it’s a silly high voltage.
Yeah, there's a screenshot in the github project where you can see the result. The floor and ceiling are basically textures in the horizontal plane, but as the camera moves and rotates they have to be mapped per pixel
why do you waste your time coding and playing these useless games. at least make something useful.
I really wanna try that 'RPG Adventure', what is it?
how does one make tic tac toe more difficult?
Win 2k is STILL frogging awesome
Oohh you just reminded me I need to find my 2k disk and install it too
my bad, thank you
Because it's fun
Insert &lt;WHAT YEAR IS THIS&gt; meme.
'Easy' plays randomly and as such is really easy to beat 'Medium' plays randomly but will always take the winning space if it can, and block if you're about to win, so you can still win most of the time if you trap 'Impossible' plays perfectly for the first two rounds and therefore can't lose
As stated elsewhere it's a really bad text adventure I use to try out new features of python as I learn them. It's very incomplete and will crash sometimes. If you're really curious it's downloadable from my github page, just run 'game_manager.py' https://github.com/flobbley/python_games
Learning a new skill by doing something you enjoy is the best way to do it. OP would you happen to have the link to your GIT handy I’d love to see how you coded difficulty into norts and crosses
sure thing! https://github.com/flobbley/python_games
I'm going there alone, so I would glad to find some company :)
i see you went for the very literal definition of impossible. i like it
Thank you all for the advice. It's tough to figure out what I really want/need to do.
writing something useful is 10x more fun. and there is certainly a lot of useful and interesting code that needs to be written.
Ahah makes sense now I’ve had a butchers thanks OP A variation of rock paper scissors lizard Spock would fit into that list nicely

Python ecosystem supports Websocket pretty well using asyncio and native async syntax is not a must. [Autobahn Python](https://autobahn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) for example provides a Twisted (and asyncio) based backend for WebSocket clients and server. See [here](https://github.com/crossbario/autobahn-python/tree/master/examples/twisted/websocket/echo) for a basic Client and Server Echo implementation. In terms of speed etc. this might give some insights https://crossbario.com/blog/Autobahn-Pi-Benchmark/
I have a top trumps game which will always pick the best option. You can lose 15 times in a row
Tic-tac-toe? Really? Strange game. The only winning move is not to play.
Wouldn’t that cause problems with the running systems? Especially uninstalling python 2.7?

He’s not wrong
Here's an article on using ffmpeg in Python that was really useful for me: http://zulko.github.io/blog/2013/09/27/read-and-write-video-frames-in-python-using-ffmpeg/
Sounds like you want an asynchronous thread updating a variable after sleeping x seconds for the main thread to grab
how does anyone get anything done?
There are ways to get around that kind of stuff \*cough\* \*cough\* virtualization \*cough\* \*cough\*
Luckily I can get on IRC using windows Remote Desktop. Other people have to use their phones as a distraction.
I'm quite new to python, so that would work? It would update the main number (0.10, we'll call is M for short) every x amount of seconds with a 10% increase or decrease?
Depends on the system. Not a problem on windows.
I'll make sure to check it out thanks for sharing!
Can i have the link to the code?
Random errors just happening is not a thing. When a problem is intermittent like that it is a pretty good hint you either have a thread synchronization issue or memory corruption issue. Although unlikely it is possible you have some piece of hardware like a memory module going bad. Usually its your code though.
No, why should you use a huge, heavyweight dependency like numpy when a small, lightweight solution already exists?
rename the exe to something else
How easy for him, after he has reached the goals he wants, to now say men should not have the same opportunities he had.
Ok thanks, I think it might be the memory error, because it always happens when I try and access json variables .
It bothers me how nuclear is the only uncapitalised word. Is there a reason for that? Are u sending it out a secret message? Do u want me to solve a series of sequentially difficult puzzles until we get together and Mr. Robot the world? (*・-・)
If it consistently happens when you try to access a specific object i would disagree that it is a memory corruption bug. Have you tried stepping through the debugger and inspecting the json object? You might find that it doesn't look the way you think it does. Also, no one will be able to give you a definite answer without seeing your code.
My distance vision is pretty much not there at all so, no. (If anyone has a wall sized 8K, I'll give it a try though).
thank you
thank you, I heard the website stopped updating would you still recommend it?
Thats hilarious. Please excuse me as i copy you.
Still used in allot of industrial controllers - solid as a rock.
I started at 36 so you are still a spring chicken. My advice is start with a video course that will help you get yourself oriented and set you up with a a lot of other programming stuff tidbits that you will need, like picking a text editor, setting up venv. Etc. Udemy has some nice cheap courses. Depending on your exact interest (web development, data science, etc ) books tend to focus on the language itself without showing you the whole process and environment where you actually use the language.
Yeah I'm going to do that tonight and make sure everything is correct. Thanks for the help!
Sounds like Guido has a racist gender bias against white males to me.
Funny how it's not the women that must be made more confident, but we need to make men more timid. The great thing about computers is they don't care who's at the keyboard. How about we just let the code talk for itself? Or accept everyone looking for advice? When I ask on my local python group slack channel for help, they don't ask for a DNA swab.
Thanks. Do you have any recommendations besides udemy? I started watching Corey Shafer on utube. How long did it take you to get the basics straight? How much time did you spend on learning in the beginning? Thank you again.
&gt;Rossum says that he now mentors women and underrepresented minority programmers. “But white guys can forget it,” he said. “They are not the ones who need it most.” Good to know every white male is better than any woman or minority, regardless of their backgrounds. Poor white guy from a broken home, highschool dropout learning Python inbetween shifts at a shitty minimum wage job? You're still better off than a privileged "minority" and more intelligent by default. &gt;Rather, he thinks it’s important that men are educated about their biases. try becoming educated on your racial biases you piece of shit. And I'm sure he's enjoying tutoring women, looking forward to the \#MeToo scandal involving this PoS that will come out in the next few years.
He should step down and give a minority his job. He loves diversity so much, why doesn't he practice what he preaches.
Check out Python documentation in Google which also has a tutorial in it explaining everything about the language. That is usually the first place I go to when learning a new language since each one has its own documentation and is usually the best resource to go to.

No problem man!
Could you share this? I've found a couple git repos with code ~3-4 years old and several of the links don't work (looks like reseveamerica updated its site).
It depends on how much time you have and what your goals are. I am a hoppyist so I do that in my spare time, sometimes I would have weeks without doing anything with coding. My goal was to start building a backend that serves a website and communicates with a database. Most of my time was wasted trying to figure out the website part which is html/css/JavaScript and not python. The python part was the easy part in my opinion. Python is really the easiest programming language I dealt with. It is really almost like writing in English compared to other languages. I did switch from python to Go and JS just because what I am doing need that in particular. But whenever I need to do something in python I am always in love of how fast and easy it is compared to building the same program in Go. The later is far faster but for most think python is plenty fast.
Windows 95 did not have desktop folders where you could see files inside.
I'm learning myself and currently switching between plural sight and Codecademy keeping both the python fundamentals on plural sight and Codecademy's python course in step and its working really well, the plural sight stuff gives you great depth and Codecademy gives you tasks to test your knowledge and make you think a little.
Omg you are right. Maybe I approached this the wrong way. Would you happen to know where to start if I want to understand the basic concept of programming and how to structure the program? Maybe some kind of a beginner's cs course? The thing is I won't have much time since I have a full time job and two little ones. But programming fascinates me because of the problem solving skills you acquire. Also I work as a translator/interpreter which is as much as I can tell a dying industry and I'm looking to switch to something more sustainable in the next 10 years. Don't want to sink with the ship 😊
Great advice. Thank you.
When I was about to share it here as a reply, I put my blog address into it and discovered a problem: it strips out HTML, but it doesn't strip out Javascript. I have to troubleshoot that. Also, the final code will have some acknowledgements. import requests from bs4 import BeautifulSoup result = requests.get("https://agentanakinai.wordpress.com/") #convert to text plain_text = result.text #lxml format soup = BeautifulSoup(plain_text,'lxml') for tag in soup.findAll(True): tag.attrs = None print(soup.get_text())
What about an ASCII tetris

Kaggle is great for seeing how people munge, explore, visualize, and analyze datasets. It's not in the form of "here's a question, now submit an answer," but it might be the most fitting site for data science.
/r/learnpython and read the sidebar
Pretty funny how this sub is probably 90% white men who are working fucking HARD to make it anywhere and likely working abusive hours for scraps if at all. No need to worry when you've already made it.
Oh no! I loved that site. I guess not... darn.
Yes he is. Ever wonder why 95% of basketball players are black males?
That is something you learn along the way with your first language. Python is great to begin here because you don’t have to fuss with complex syntax in addition to learning basics. Part of it is just practice, a mental skill that you have to develop with training. It is like learning a natural language, you can read a dictionary and a grammar book but you can’t really speak it unless you do it over and over and practice. The other thing that you will discover is that no one actually learns just one language, for example if you want to learn how to do websites, you will have to learn html/css/JavaScript as well.
Wow, basketball favors the tall, and what you REALLY mean is the NBA. "According to racial equality activist Richard Lapchick, the NBA in 2015 was composed of 74.4 percent black players, 23.3 percent white players, 1.8 percent Latino players of any race, and 0.2 percent Asian players." BUT you miss the point completely. WOMEN were the original programmers. (easily verified on google) And yes, Asians (which includes Indian/Pakistani/etc) make up a large portion of developers worldwide, but NOT in the USA. In the USA, you'll find white males holding almost 85% of tech positions. https://qz.com/940660/tech-is-overwhelmingly-male-and-men-are-just-fine-with-that/ Diversity is a good thing; for everyone. BUT, not everyone wants it.

Need that drug dealer game
NBA and professional basketball players are 'not average' in any context. I'd like to stick to the original point. I feel Python CAN benefit from a wider diversity and inclusiveness to underrepresented portions of American society. I don't know about the rest of the world, so I'll leave that to the experts.
To me people who fight for diversity so _aggressively_ just lose all credibility in my eyes. I'm pretty certain big majority of python programmers would love to have more lady co-workers. Who wouldn't? Especially since software engineers tend to be very progressing on the grand scale of things. Have you wondered why people who complain about "lack of diversity" never quote any real statistics or papers and just personal anecdotes like this one awkward nerd was mean to this girl. To me the whole shelter and protect the girls just feels like a misogynist move by itself, doesn't this imply that ladies are not as capable here? There are also some minors things like blaming open source culture that doesn't require you to identify in any way shape or form.

&gt;Diversity is a good thing; &amp;#x200B; First of all define what you mean by diversity. &amp;#x200B; Then prove why it's a good thing. Evidence please, metrics, studies. Whatever. &amp;#x200B; Seriously, when I want to assert that Python is better than Bash or Perl, I have to demonstrate why. When I want to use tool X over tool Y, I have to do the same. Why do people pushing for diversity get a pass on evidence? Is it just because they're perceived as being nice?
I hate video tutorials. Spare me the intro, spare me the extra-thick accent, spare me the time spent watching you type out every individual thing, spare me the "like and subscribe" thing at the end.

Nice! This is a good idea to practice some coding techniques. Learn something and see if you can add to your game collection. I might try this out. Thanks!
So what are you using as a definition of "diversity"?
do you know how to find the projects people worked on? I wanted to get a feel on how to start one myself
seems like hacker rank is popular
Who cares? I agree with original article. Either you do too or you don’t.
Are you being Socratic?
I'm sure it's a wall paper... But I have a few old copies lying about... 98se is way better, tho. Something about a math coprocessor support ,makes everything better.
oh really cool
That's really cool!
&gt; You get literally the best of both worlds. No, you get literally the worst of both worlds: the core devs still have to maintain a large library, but users will have to deal with bits of the "standard" library going missing. Its already bad enough when Linux distros decide to strip out bits of the stdlib so that "apt install python" doesn't install the entire standard library. People then have to work out what bits are missing and install them. You want to magnify that by a thousand. For nearly 30 years, "batteries included" has worked to drive Python into the top five most popular languages. Lets break what works and replace it with poorly thought out bad ideas, because reasons!!!
How do you even make Tic Tac Toe more difficult or easier?
Ah man, there are a lot of great sites that people have suggested here. I think you may need to type something into Google and go for it; otherwise, you may find yourself forever questioning whether or not any of these are good routes.
Hackerrank is great for sheer volume; code signal is a bit more guided + applied.
That would break like half our CICD what the fuck
I had a hard time integrating different levels of difficulty because it was my first time coding with python and I made tic tac toe.

I made a desktop app to back up all of my projects/study materials to an external hard drive. I made it to have add/remove options for source and destination folders, and wrote an extension for it to run automatically in the background when I log on to my laptop. Not *needed* the backups yet, but I'll be glad I have it if/when my laptop goes to shit (or if i want to copy the folders over to a new laptop)
I changed it to sep='' and also sep='/r/t' . I'll try sep=','

Gdb looks ancient and inefficient vs graphic IDE debuging, where all task could be performed in fraction of time in console.
No this is way too slow to be `A*`. `A*` with euclidean or manhattan metric would start moving towards the goal immediately, this is just expanding outward. `A*` is much faster than BFS on real world usecases because it starts making immediate progress in the general correct direction, instead of just mindlessly exploring everything.

Interesting commit. Mind that an iterator is probably a better approach than a list. You can turn an iterator to a list easily, but not the other way around (using `iter()` doesn't negate that you already loaded the entire list in memory). What about the performance between scandir and ftw?
Depends what you’re comparing it too, in this case we’ll say a car, the overall system is typically 12v. Quick math that’s a 2000% higher. I’d call that silly high

It's more _Pythonic_ to exploit `in`, I feel, but the `intersection` underlines the symmetry between the two sets--but only obliquely, of course, because `intersection` is a(n object-oriented) **method** rather than a **function**.
I've been streaming songs on youtube since my childhood. All my music playlists exist on youtube. I hate running a web browser to listen to music, there should be a seperate application, a devoted music player for this hence, I created this. I love terminal applications and following the philosophy, I've tried to create something minimal. &amp;#x200B; You can find this on pypi ( `pip install --user ytermplayer` ) and [github](https://github.com/TimeTraveller-San/yTermPlayer) &amp;#x200B; Terminal UI is created using urwid YouTube streams are fetched using a very actively updating library - youtube-dl Fetched streams are played using the minimal mpv player &amp;#x200B; The UI will adapt to your terminal colors and size (if you use pywal for extracting color theme then ytermplayer will imitate pywal's colors) Check out [these images](https://imgur.com/a/GWh5MT3) for examples.
I see. I just turned them off for not much of a gain if I'm honest. By turned off I mean I commented out the call. I've since run cProfiler on the code https://pastebin.com/fGwaDgaf I see setPixel being unexpectedly high, but I'm unsure if the floor and ceiling drawing is the culprit. I also see the sample method takes up 1/15th of the cumulative time.
More likely to be a breadth search. I don't think dijkstras would have searched as much of the problem space in that scenario.
I guess you mean: ❤
You can use operators and they should have the same speed, as the method calls of the set. ```python [f1(x) for x in some_set - other_set] [f1(x) for x in other_set - other_set] [f1(x) for x in some_set &amp; other_set] [f1(x) for x in some_set | other_set] [f1(x) for x in some_set ^ other_set] ```
Thank you! Of course, the operators are perfectly available.
Those people are fighting against gender and they don't realize it. It's an agenda which is going on for long long time. Think about tax and the old families in the past. Mostly the woman stayed at home and were there for the children, made the household etc. Now woman and men are "equal" and both are working now. Currently we can feel, that woman are extensively promoted, the white men not. I give a big FUCK on political correctness and I hate it so much, that smart people are supporting this agenda, which should destroy the peace between us. &amp;#x200B; If we don't react, this agenda is not stopping. Conclusion: The feminism is against equality, everyone who is against unequal treatment, does not support the feminism. &amp;#x200B; Have a nice day.
Wanted to learn python some time ago, did some project on project Euler. Got stuck on one project and got mad and quit. Took it up yesterday again and solved the problem quite fast. Feels good to return and to continue my journey of learning python!
Wouldn’t be a genetic algorithm more efficient?
Hah this is clever
thank you

Instead of a for-loop, you can use a list comprehension. Copying the random.randint to the local scope of the function, speeds up the function call a little bit. But this is interesting, if you do it million times. Lists and Tuples have a count method. Instead of using the slow for-loops in Python, you could used the optimized code for lists and tuples. The most underlying part is written in C. ```python def count_ones_zeros(random_size=100): rnd = random.randint # speed up arr = [rnd(0,1) for _ in range(random_size)] zero, one = arr.count(0), arr.count(1) return zero / random_size * 100, one / random_size * 100 ``` By the way, don't do everythigng together. Make one function to do one calculation. If the user want, he can repeat the function in his own loop.
It will even run in your browser: https://win95.ajf.me/

Useful! Thanks for sharing! If anyone has some examples showing ingesting CSV files from SFTP, then using Python and Airflow to load that into PostGreSQL, please DM or share here. I'd like to know how everything hangs together. What if real time is needed? How different will the above workflow be?
Qt is always a good option, and you're probably going to need to drop down to some native stuff if you want to draw over other windows the way most screenshot apps do.

Fixing racism by being racist.
Diversity means nothing. For two reasons. First, I don't see the same call for diversity when it comes to nurses or babysitting. Second, nobody should care if a team is made of 33% white/33% asians/33% black. All one should care is a team made of 100% skilled people.
We need more diversity in the programming languages scenario as well. From now on, I will encourage that at least 30% of our codebase is in perl, and at least 10% in COBOL.

Have the script check the date every 24hrs (http://schedule.readthedocs.io) and if the date is what you need... run! OR Celery: http://docs.celeryproject.org/en/latest/userguide/periodic-tasks.html#crontab-schedules
You're correct, since all edges have the same weight, dijkstra is equivalent to a breath first search here
LOL ole granny! I'm 32 and I have been learning the past few weeks as well! I have been streaming it on twitch and the coding community has been UNREAL helpful! I just read, "automate the boring stuff with python" and currently reading "learning python the hard way" I got a course on udemy that was great from joe portiallia? (probs spelt his name wrong) I also got codecademy for the 1 month 40$ (however this was really quite a waste of money IMHO as a noobie I learned ALL the same stuff from any youtube video or a cheap book!) corey schafer, sentdex &amp; thenewboston on youtube have been excellent &amp;#x200B; a few site to practice some questions "Codewars" "hackerrank" "exercism.io " &amp;#x200B; (just my opinions as a noobie learning so far) &amp;#x200B; I would LOVE a friend to learn with if you are interested :)
what's wrong with scheduling with cron?
Just here to say great work, keep going super nice :)
That's really cool dude! My friend did something similar in pygame where you could draw the toppings on a pizza and it would generate a pizza with your toppings.
A year ago, I already posted a link to Mimesis, but now it is much better than a year ago and I think it is ready to be used as an addition or replacement for Faker.
Ok, there's no point in arguing with you now. You've zero knowledge about what Vim can do and yet spew your ignorance on internet like most people here. Everything you said can be done with vanilla Vim. It is fine if you don't like Vim or don't want to use it. Use whatever the hell you want, just don't spread false information about it just because you didn't bother to look up the manual or google something.

I've created a 'lib' that does this. I'm gonna work on error handling. I'm going to make sure that improper values raise exceptions. I'll push it out to the package library after that.
That’s a good question! I think you can filter the questions on hackerrank to be just those which are analytical. You could also consider doing some of Udacity’s free classes, because they often have loads of practice problems (and just skip to the practice problem sets, if you don’t want to watch the instruction portion). Personally, I did a mix of all of the above, plus sought out some unsolved problems so I could get python on my resume. For instance, I knew of someone who needed to analyze a bunch of excel files, so I used python/pandas to parse them and analyze the data, then double-checked my work by analyzing them with PowerQuery. It paid off, because the work on my resume was the work that got me my current role.
Amazon's "Polly" TTS service on AWS is excellent (same voice powering Alexa I believe). Like everything on AWS though it costs a bit of money, the first 12 months or first 5 million characters are free, after that it's $4 per million characters. For reference, that's nearly 24 hours of audio, so depending on your use case the price may be totally negligable. There are lots of good free options that run locally, I wanted to bring Polly up because it really is best in class in terms of voice quality, since that seems to be important to you. The way to interact with it within python would be the boto3 library.
This is awesome!
Thank you very much!

create a shell file which invokes the function and then execute the shell file with a cronjob, that way you have your policy (cron) and your mechanism (the script) organised separately.
Fucking Marxism.
&gt;ould as every empty space would be weighted 1 ( I came here to say Dijkstra's! Being from the networking world its the one i know the best :)
You also see no calls for diversity in the garbage collection sector. You only see calls for diversity in professions and spaces that imply either *power* or "jobs that look easy from the outside" (*desk work*). The rule is: * if the job is physically dangerous, or * the job carries no power, or * it carries no high salaries, or * it's already dominated by wamen, you won't see any of these fucking Marxists demanding "diversity" for it.
thanks! Yeah, that's my next one this is simply dijkstra's
screeperz is right, but not gonna lie, this started off as dijkstra's and I just got confused haha
Yeah sure, what's the best way to do that. GitHub?

Memory management in CPython (other implementations sometime implement things differently) works by reference counting. Every time a reference to an object goes out of scope, the reference count of the object is decremented. Once the reference count reaches 0 (i.e. no names point to that object anymore), the object is cleaned up (this may not happen instantly, don't rely on something being garbage collected at a specific time). Regarding different types of memory: This isn't Python specific, but the memory used by an application is generally stored in RAM. For your purposes, you will almost certainly not be in a situation where you cannot assume that for all intents and purposes RAM access takes constant time, so don't worry about that. Only once your RAM actually fills up, the operating system will swap out some of the memory to disk, which will come with orders of magnitude slowdown when accessing that memory (especially if you don't have an SSD). Now my question would be what kind of data are you actually trying to collect? Because I very much suspect that for what you're doing, RAM usage will be completely irrelevant as you're unlikely to use more than a tiny fraction of the RAM you have in your computer.
I used python, pytorch, and sympy to try and make neural networks assemble and train to be effective at simple logic gate tasks. When one successfully assembles for a simple task, I "modularize" it to try and make it usable in more complex logic circuits.
No, it's just that the **only** diversity that has been proven to increase economic output, is **diversity of thought**. Diversity of feelz and skin color is bullshit.
Yup. That's the best. I'd also be happy to code review the spaghetti.
&gt; Still used in allot of industrial controllers - solid as a rock. So long as you reboot it daily. And don't install any software. Or connect to the Internet. Or move the mouse. Hell, to be safe, just keep the computer turned off, and you'll never need to worry about it crashing. *wink*
I’m not at home rn but I’ll upload and shoot you a link when I get back
I did work in a nuclear power plant a long while back, 1 year of continuous uptime was not that uncommon. Most of these machines were not connected to the internet - they monitored industrial controls and usually ran one or two programs at most. People were not surfing the internet or playing games - just watching and controlling big pieces of equipment.
(snaps fingers like a hipster at a jazz show) and hey, daddio, what do you know, **diversity of thought** COMES from unique experiences that other races, genders and sexual orientation have LIVED through that white, cis-gendered heterosexual males have not. To be clear: i'm not saying diversity is ONLY solution; but it CAN be beneficial. I live in Chicago, where EEOC laws have enabled People of Color to join Police and Fire careers, much to the chagrin of White Males who complain about 'unfairness' of it all. But hey, you can always be a White Male Cop anywhere else in the country. Go for it. I'm NOT advocating forced, or contrived diversity; i'm just saying, companies, universities and society would benefit from greater inclusiveness of developers (including python) who are not white males. This is my opinion. I don't need to quote facts or statistics; stuff it. I'm just agreeing with the original article.

&gt; How about we just let the code talk for itself? I asked my code to justify why it was using `map` instead of a list comp, and it just said "Fuck you! I don't have to explain myself!"
But we're not simply comparing voltages. You said it won't do anything unless it's silly high. So i implicitly asked: is this silly high [enough to do something]
Sometimes the snake has teeth.
&gt; to now say men should not have the same opportunities he had. That's not even close to what he said. There's some... interesting... questions raised by Guido's comments (and one has to ask, how accurately was he quoted?) but putting words into his mouth is no way to fairly discuss this issue. White men in the developed world typically have heaps of opportunities (although those opportunities are in no way distributed evenly). If Guido wants to spend his time mentoring people who don't have those opportunities, that doesn't mean he wants to drag white men down and prevent them from getting anywhere. If you want to criticize, criticize *fairly* or STFU. Thank you.

Thanks for pointing me to the new sub! I've been playing with this, but it's eluding me.
You can use a `for` loop to apply it to every individual item in the list.
Yeah thats a good idea, I should have probably just made it clear that you can do that when you instantiate the class ie. TweetLib(username='bob', max_tweets=10) instead of calling each set function. I'll update the docs. Thanks!
A loop? Hmmm, I've seen that, but haven't played with it yet. Thanks! I'll dig in.
Thanks a lot @unwashedmouse21 I got it to run perfectly by using a comma in the single quotes.
But what I still don't get is why was there a difference in the output even though the code and the file were same. It would be amazing if I were to know about this.
It's just hilarious that you think having a bunch of black people in business would make it 'more' productive. Samsung or even (gasp) Huawei aren't shit because they're 100% Asian.

This: [http://www.forbes.com/sites/lisawinning/2018/03/13/its-time-to-prioritize-diversity-across-tech/](http://www.forbes.com/sites/lisawinning/2018/03/13/its-time-to-prioritize-diversity-across-tech/) And this: [https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/321516](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/321516) And this: [https://notablelife.com/pressboard-5-bulletproof-arguments-on-why-we-need-diversity-in-tech/](https://notablelife.com/pressboard-5-bulletproof-arguments-on-why-we-need-diversity-in-tech/) Economic reasons; not just “warm fuzzies.”
Two details in the first half of this talk are dead wrong. With this bit of code: if (match := pattern.search(data)): do_something(match) He claims that `match` does exist beyond the scope of the if-statement, that it doesn't hang around later. This is wrong. If-statements do not create a scope in Python and assignment expressions create their names in the current scope. Referencing `match` later in the same scope still works. He also says that the second line of this code is not allowed. x = y = z = 0 # Yes (x := (y := (z := 0))) # No That is a complete misread of this text from the PEP: &gt; - Multiple targets are not directly supported: &gt; x = y = z = 0 # Equivalent: (z := (y := (x := 0))) What this text means is that x := y := z := 0 is not directly supported. In order to accomplish something similar you need those parenthesis, as the comment in the PEP shows. (To be clear, to do this would be horribly bad style.) I like PEP 572. I think it's a minor improvement to the language (not a popular opinion) that I will occasionally use. It disappoints me that someone who should be getting this right got it wrong.
No, *your* racism is showing. I strongly advocate for meritocracy, which has borne out outsize East Asian and Jewish success in the majority white country of the United States of America. The failure or successes of certain ethnic groups in certain spheres is not desirable or nor desirable, it reflects on nobody but themselves. Also, fucking lol @ those "articles". Again, I will reiterate: Samsung, Huawei, Nintendo, or a host of companies largely made up of 100% Asian males are not failures or successes because of diversity. These companies succeed in the same way that Asian males in America succeed... and the same way that Nigerians in Nigeria do not.
should be noted that the heuristic can make the algorithm slower in some cases. It works much better the fewer obstacles there are (so, for practical applications in most games it's usually far superior), but for full blown mazes with lots of obstacles it's tough to get much improvement

Do you have any past experience in software development ? Where are you geographically ? Advice may depend a lot on the above 2. In certain geographies, finding a software developer job at the age of 40 would be bit difficult but certainly not impossible. One way may be to start freelancing. Initially, contributing in some opensource projects, having certain number of approved git commits and accepted patches under your belt may help spruce up your resume. Web-development is often considered to have a low entry barrier (i.e. easier to get in), but then it is so for a very large number of people. Niche segments are harder to get in, as the skill-level they require are higher. Best might be to seek advice locally. Spend time to research demand, requirements in the job market etc. Having friends who could recommend you to such jobs, would also be good people to seek advice from.
Thanks @\_redmist. I'd checked out csounds, but the library seems to be pretty low level for my purposes. There would be a \*lot\* of plumbing and abstraction that I'd have to build first, to get to point where I wish to.

Ahh my apologies. Yes from what research I did: A spark plug has a high enough voltage to to use air as a conductive medium (that’s the spark). Fluid (piss) in this case is significant more conductive than air. So if you did manage to piss on a spark plug and the stream didn’t break it would shock you. But 25000v from a spark plug isn’t as bad as it sounds I have personally touched one, it’s a similar feeling to a static shock x10-20.
Hmz I see. How about music21? It does only output midi iirc.
I'm talking about programmers, not any particular company. I'm talking all genders and races, not 'any particular one' and so, you can advocate meritocracy (which really only has come into fruition in past 70 years, because, maybe racism? [https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/oct/19/the-myth-of-meritocracy-who-really-gets-what-they-deserve](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/oct/19/the-myth-of-meritocracy-who-really-gets-what-they-deserve) or even [https://ssir.org/articles/entry/the\_mantra\_of\_meritocracy](https://ssir.org/articles/entry/the_mantra_of_meritocracy) the recent college scandal exposes what a myth Meritocracy is in education: [https://www.thenation.com/article/rajan-menon-meritocracy-myth-college-admissions-scandal/](https://www.thenation.com/article/rajan-menon-meritocracy-myth-college-admissions-scandal/) There's no perfect solution, but WELCOMING those who "don't match" our current majority of developers is really not a bad idea. And frankly, if you're white male and really wanna develop, go for it. I'm not saying you can't. I'm just advocating for giving others a hand. Is that so hard to understand?
Maybe this visual will help better. I'm advocating for equity, not equality [http://culturalorganizing.org/the-problem-with-that-equity-vs-equality-graphic/](http://culturalorganizing.org/the-problem-with-that-equity-vs-equality-graphic/)
You're welcome!
Probably this - [https://github.com/pandas-profiling/pandas-profiling](https://github.com/pandas-profiling/pandas-profiling)
The file you're reading had columns separated by commas. When you set sep='\t', the program was waiting for a tab before it read the next value in a new column. Since the tab never appeared in a line, it read the entire thing into a single column. Setting sep=',' told the program to split the values into columns whenever a comma was read. BTW the default value of the sep parameter is ',' i.e. you don't need to state this explicitly
You don't. &amp;#x200B; You format the number with 2 decimal places when you convert it to a string.
That's it! Thanks
&gt;**I'm just advocating for giving others a hand. Is that so hard to understand?** It's always at the expense of white people. &amp;#x200B; Jews, who suffered the worst discrimination in the world, never got a hand. Jews are now massively successful. &amp;#x200B; Asians, who suffered bad discrimination, never got a hand. Asians are not massively successful. &amp;#x200B; The problem that you're encountering, and the pushback from whites, is that you believe that all racial groups should have identical group outcomes selectively (no mention of Asian mathematicians or black athletes), so any type of failure by certain groups implies that whites are somehow acting maliciously. &amp;#x200B; Whites are not acting maliciously, these groups are failing or succeeding on their own merits. If you'd like to learn more, and be less implicitly hateful by whites, try coming up with a more robust thesis than "whites are oppressing people!" (except asian mathematicians, jewish everythings, and black athletes for some reason). &amp;#x200B; In doing so, you'll probably learn a lot about genetics.
What happens if I have this dictionary in memory and between the time I generate it and the time I use it, someone else deletes one of the rows in the table? How does the dictionary in memory reflect the change? Same for updates and inserts?
Yes like to say if the value of all weights were 1 they would behave the same. The real difference between them is that Dijkstra finds the minimum cost based on distance that needs to be traveled to the goal. Whereas bfs finds the distance based on steps \ hops it takes to reach its goal. (from what i can remember)
round(yournumber, 2)
Looks like good ol' Dijkstra? Love the visualisation. Hadn't thought of using pygame before but now I want to!
Genetics? Women were the original programmers..... that's been flipped on its head, why? Not because they're 'worse' or genetically inferior, but because American Business tends to be dominated by White Males and so, advancement and equal pay simply doesn't happen for them. Jewish people are still 'white' so your racism is still showing. There's an inherent bias with groups hiring 'those who look like them' that's natural and well documented. HOWEVER, Programming can be done anonymously, where no one knows you're a Bernese Mountain Dog or Bill Gates. So, its easy enough to bypass that bias by reaching out to those who don't identify as white male and showing them how to program (at NO LOSS OR EXPENSE to other white males of the world) and then, voila! Everyone is operating at an even level --well, at least in theory when working online with no actual visual or personal interactions. I'm a Liberal and I believe giving people an equal chance is a GOOD thing. But its not always practical or possible, but its something we can strive for, yeah? Again, Not at the expense of white males; they can program their hearts out all day with dictionaries, pandas and Big Data. But yeah, maybe recognize that there's value in diversity is a good thing? If you don't agree with me, that's fine. Its a free country. There's plenty of room for those who want to be inclusive and those who prefer to work with blinders on.
How much detotated wam would you recommend?
After looking around for options, I think that my best bet would be to go down the MIDI route. I found the python wrapper for rtmidi (python-rtmidi) which seems promising. While midi still doesn't offer the high level of music theory abstraction that I was hoping for, it still is something that has enough documentation around for, and proven. Coupled with fluidsynth and a good soundfont, I think I should be able to proceed.
facts lmao you would be so screwed afterwards

I have been developing software for 30yrs. The last 8yrs I have been developing cloud native application and pretty much everything I deploy is in a serverless microservice environment. Over three years ago we started using Python. I was part of a 10 person team and nobody had any Python experience but from concept to delivery to our first customer we were able to do so in 8 months. I have no experience in Machine Learning nor Data Science. What I can tell is out experience with Python and learning Python. Training: 1. We used the Python Udemy Courses to get started and there are some complete courses that they have available that we all believe are very good. 2. We also made extensive use of the videos found on YouTube. Some that I believe are very are 1. [Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfscVS0vtbw&amp;t=386s) From freecodecamp 2. [ Python Tutorial for Beginners | Full Python Programming Course \[2019\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uQrJ0TkZlc) 3. If I want just an overview of a feature, I look for videos from Corey Schafer 4. You can find AI and Data Science video as well 5. All your existing knowledge does not get thrown out the window you just tailor it to Python 6. Checkout the Pycon 2019 Videos as well as those from past years 3. Books 1. Our company as allowed us to have a shared book shelf for our team that includes all the Pink O'Reilly books on Python. They are still a good reference over a web search especially for a topic I have not looked at deeply or for some time and need a refresher. 4. Websites 1. [https://realpython.com/](https://realpython.com/) \-- By far my favorite and which I find most useful 2. [http://www.blog.pythonlibrary.org/](http://www.blog.pythonlibrary.org/) \-- This is my go to website during lunch. Not always relevant but always interesting. Recently an article helped us better automate our build with Jenkins using Python 3. [https://www.thepythoncorner.com/](https://www.thepythoncorner.com/?doing_wp_cron=1558718726.5092120170593261718750) \-- Slow to get updates but good articles 4. [https://blog.feedspot.com/python\_blogs/](https://blog.feedspot.com/python_blogs/) \-- list of Python Blogs and websites. Some are better than others. 5. Visual Studio Code 1. VS Code is not are main editor for Python as well as other languages. We are doing some work with Rust to speed up some code. 1. Extensions 2. The main Microsoft Extension for Python has pretty much everything. 3. I do like the MagicPython extension as well as GitLens which I could not do without. 4. Python Extended is great for snippets and code complete that include arguments 5. There are a lot of them, I try to limit to what I find useful for a particular task which means I will turn some on/off as required. 6. The Docker integration works great once you get it setup Hope this helps
Looking at my previous comment, it may have come off flippant or rude, so first of all, apologies for that. It wasn't my intention Second, thanks so much for the response. Very informative.
Why the hell would women demand to work in low-status, poorly paid, physically harmful jobs? They've got plenty of them already. What an asinine rule. You could only think it was meaningful if you thought that women were drooling morons who aspired no better than the same old crappy jobs they've had for centuries. P.S. You must be a American, because you apparently wouldn't know a Marxist if one fell out of the sky, landed on your head and started singing the Macarena. Here's a clue: "Marxist" doesn't mean "anyone I don't like".
Thanks
Made a genetic algorithm too should I post?

That would be awesome. Message me. We can have like a competition although you are ahead of me a lot. I started with corey Shafer and I just can't find the time to incorporate the books. Are they boring?
It my be any error while loading the package (and not only that it can't find it). Probably an issue with dynamic libraries not matching with your python. You should remove the try catch and post error in learnpython. Also your python versions and how you install packages.
no sudoku😶🤔
I've just started trying out the VS Code python extension. Convenient, as I like VS Code. But mostly I've been using the portable version of [WinPython](https://winpython.github.io/) with Spyder3 as the IDE. The WinPython release is currently at 3.7.2. Support for Jupyter Notebooks and JupiterLab is included in the install, which is nice.
Take some the code you have been creating and check it into Git. Then create a CI/CD pipeline where you deploy your code into a docker container. There even a Jenkins Python module that is available. If your company doesn't is using AWS, lookup Boto3 and automate some devil's function
Would you mind us sharing the GitHub code / repo on our Twitter profile, once you create one?
I would actually recommend working through tutorials in those separate frameworks/services before using a Python API wrapper. Once you understand the tools themselves, you can better understand when/why you would want to use Python to interact with and between those tools.
Absolutely, I spend 4 hours a day on hands on labs. I use Cloud Academy, [Cloud.Guru](https://Cloud.Guru), and qwiklabs for specific tools. Right now I am finishing up a Kubernetes course. Which I am excited to implement
Do you use a github that you could share ? As a student is computer science, I would like to take a look &amp; drink all the science you made (btw very cool algorithm man)

If you can provision a virtual machine with pyvmomi and return all it's settings you'll have had your baptism by fire.
Fantastic! I've added these improvements to the code. These are micro optimizations but especially the set\_pixel one increased the overall render fps by a few digits, because it's so heavily used.

&gt; and hey, daddio, what do you know, diversity of thought COMES from unique experiences that other races, genders and sexual orientation have LIVED through that white, cis-gendered heterosexual males have not. No, it does not, you racist fuck.
&gt; Why the hell would women demand to work in low-status, poorly paid, physically harmful jobs? Brilliant question. The question itself basically answers itself. It isn't about equality. It's about capturing power and money. Not on the basis of merit, but on the basis of genitals / skin color / delusions. Companies that whiff that smell and follow it, deserve everything they get, long, and hard.
The search space would be equivalent, but dijkstra would have a longer runtime
As the above said, start with automate the boring stuff. Very straight forward and easy to understand. I'm working my way through it now and just about done with the first half. I try to do an hour a day. Good luck!
Oh yeah I didn't submit a PR because I couldn't get it above 20fps. Turning off the ceiling and animations didn't help either though. One last micro-optimization I did make hoping for a bigger bang for my buck was to not instantiate `self.ImageTk` per-frame, instead using paste to overwrite pixels (technically the buffer should be cleared and is just written to, but IDK if TK handles that itself. def init_gui_image(self): self.imageTk = ImageTk.PhotoImage(self.raycaster.image.resize( (self.PIXEL_WIDTH*self.PIXEL_SCALE, self.PIXEL_HEIGHT*self.PIXEL_SCALE), Image.NEAREST)) self.label.configure(image=self.imageTk) self.update_idletasks() def update_gui_image(self): self.imageTk.paste( self.raycaster.image.resize( ( self.PIXEL_WIDTH*self.PIXEL_SCALE, self.PIXEL_HEIGHT*self.PIXEL_SCALE ), Image.NEAREST ), ( (0, 0), (self.xMax, 0), (self.xMax, self.yMax), (0, self.yMax), ) ) self.update_idletasks() There are larger performance issues at play here. Every nested loop is a potential problem. Running for 10 minutes returns less than 6 minutes of profiling time (so 4 minutes of idling is likely a result of unnecessary waits). It could even be that the PIL and TK are incapable, or difficult to get high frame-rates from. The vector implementation could probably be deferred to something else. Heres the minimal profiling code from cPython `run_profile.py` import cProfile from pyraycaster.gui import main cProfile.run('main()') import cProfile The resizing IDK. It makes things simpler to think about, but makes another moving piece and responsibility. If working with software has taught me one thing it's that all the discrete operations you've got probably need to change to be group operations.
&gt; dijkstra's Breadth-first search. Unless there are different costs to enter different squares, it's just BFS. Dijkstra's algorithm only comes into play when it's possible for a path with *more* steps to be *shorter* than another path because some of the individual steps have higher cost.
Yes.
Yes. And if the cost of each step is the same, then "minimum cost" and "minimum number of steps" are equivalent.
As a [Plumbum](https://plumbum.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cli.html) fanboy, here I go fanboy-ing again: from plumbum.cli import Application, SwitchAttr, NonexistentPath, ExistingFile class Copier(Application): """ Write the contents of one file to another """ input_file = SwitchAttr(['i', 'input-file'], ExistingFile, help="An input file path") output_file = SwitchAttr(['o', 'output-file'], NonexistentPath, help="An output file path") def main(self): self.output_file.write(self.input_file.read()) # or # with open(self.input_file) as in_file: # with open(self.output_file, "w") as out_file: # for line in in_file: # out_file.write(line) if __name__ == "__main__": Copier()
When running it with pypy it zooms by at 60 fps. I'll try your image paste trick. And yeah; this is a classic approach at the problem, but that was my intention. This code was not meant to reach "playable fps" (30+ or so) although it would have been nice if it was able to using the default Python interpreter.
Faker...anyone?
This PEP severely worries me. I've never seen a case where performance is not impacted when no hooks are added, yet the claim is &gt; The important performance impact is the case where events are being raised but there are no hooks attached. This is the unavoidable case - once a developer has added audit hooks they have explicitly chosen to trade performance for functionality. Performance impact with hooks added are not of interest here, since this is opt-in functionality. &gt; Analysis using the Python Performance Benchmark Suite [1] shows no significant impact, with the vast majority of benchmarks showing between 1.05x faster to 1.05x slower. &gt; In our opinion, the performance impact of the set of auditing points described in this PEP is negligible. Are the benchmarks comparable to real world use cases or are these microbenchmarks?

Hacking Idle to incorporate two of my other projects: AvantPy[1] and Friendly-traceback[2]. I made a video [3] (intentionally with no sound) just this morning to demonstrate it.

Honestly no, I didn’t understand it. The book I was given in class to read was confusing and then it would skip to chapters on an overview of how to write Perl, Java, C++, Bash, Python but not like how to write but just an overview of what you could do if you chose to buy that book and use it. Not even sure if it would be written better.
/r/learnpython and read the sidebar.
I wonder if they might be referring to shell scripts. Python is much easier to get your head around and the text books tend to be less technical and more beginner friendly.
My bad
You know I have to be honest... I have not read a book in YEARS im all audio books now... and I looked at automate the boring stuff and thought... "oh god this is going to put me to sleep" however as I read it I understood things that I have been trying to learn and it was SO MUCH FUN to read and slowly piece together things that have not been making much sense... I read 300 pages! the first night! I finished the book the next morning which I have NEVER done in my life! As the days past and I watched some more youtube videos lets say on "reading / writing files" which made no sense in the book I could go back to the book and read the chapter again and compare it to Corey Schafer or a video I had watched and it all starts to make A LOT more sense! (to me anyway!)
Do I just reply on all of the threads?
Still, A* is optimally efficient. That is, no other algorithm can guarantee finding the shortest path without evaluating at least as many nodes as A*.
Corporations are not the target audience for Python. If they want to use Python, fine. Then they can adapt to Python. Python should not adapt to corporations. Corporations already have languages that cater to their needs. Python doesn't need corporation support to thrive. Developers love it and will use it regardless of corporate non-sense. To the point of not working for corporations. Case in point, me.
I'm 5 minutes into that video and I'm in love already.
Nope, dijkstra's can run with all of them having the same weight, but it's real use is for edges with different weights. If all weights are same, BFS runs in O(V+E) and dijkstras runs in O(ElogV) (can be faster), which means theres no reason to use dijkstras for unweighted graphs
Could you just edit it in the main post or make a separate comment? Much appreciated
its bfs
bfs finds shortest paths in unweighted graphs, not dfs :)

Using Google/Amazon API's and your own hardware handily solves the "what might be overheard when I am not interacting with the machine" concern, as you will control what activates the microphone and interacts with the relevant API.

The second result for me when Googlin' for "python speech recognition" is what looks like a good guide: https://realpython.com/python-speech-recognition/ If you're going to become a programmer, you've got to learn how to search for stuff before you just go asking questions of other people.

Do you realize that Python is a language to write computer programs, and Linux and Unix are simply operating systems like Windows which run those programs?

Corey Schafer and Sentdex have been great as I've been learning
Yeah, it's been a while since I learned this stuff. Guess it was a mistake to comment, haha
For pathfinding, either euclidean distance or manhattan distance are quite good and are constant time operations.
Socratica! They have a great production quality and are entertaining. They also use fun or really good eksamples when they are teaching. Highly under rated in my opinion. They have got me through my first semester! https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLi01XoE8jYohWFPpC17Z-wWhPOSuh8Er-
They’re constant time operations if you already have both locations readily available. You might have to look them up in a tree or elsewhere though depending on how things are set up.
I recommend Juian Nash. He seems new to youtube and very underrated. His [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5_oFcBFlawLcFCBmU7oNZA).
During the A* loop the goal is available in constant time, and the position you are looking at is also directly available in the node you are visiting at that time, so those are really constant.

Tech with Tim It's a small channel, but the videos are well edited and the content is good.
Definitely Corey Schafer. He's helped me learn and understand so many concepts (python was my first lang) such as classes, decorators, context managers, etc. He even has 2 entire web development series for Django and flask.
Engineer man is great and not just for python. Really talks through things in an easy to follow way.
