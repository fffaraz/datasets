Good luck my friend. Thats a tough one.
Can I get a picture of the maze so I can try it myself. 
For any programming language, might I add.
[This](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) is a great place to start. I have completed this course and now currently doing [deeplearning.ai](https://deeplearning.ai) specialization.

Honestly, it will probably not be worth anything to a recruiter because there are hundreds of these certificates floating around and there’s actually no guarantee that **you** were the one who actually did the certification. That said, what you learn in it will/may be 100% meaningful, so don’t discount the certificate. Your best bet is to make a GitHub account and upload the code you write for the course there. This is how employers would be able to actually judge you.
Perfect answer, thank you!

I write code for supercomputers where performance is needed and very optimized, so I know about the need for maximizing performance. I also know that you are absolutely wasting your time if you don’t profile your code and this give yourself a hard tangible reason to change things.
I am profiling every bit of code and this is just one thing that could easily be optimized because there is a faster implementation already. Why are you discussing this with me? Can you actually answer my OP question?
I edited with 3 options after I posted cause I realized I should at least answer the question.

More specifically, here’s the GitHub code https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Modules/mathmodule.c Search for `math_dist_impl`. You’ll need to copy that along with the `_math.h` and `Python.h` files which you’ll find in the same directory. There might be others you need. You’ll then need to download and install a C compiler. Python probably uses gcc, but if speed is paramount then I would go with the intel c compiler. In my experience it’s faster than gcc, assuming you have an intel processor. Good luck. 
Making my first python package. This project came out as a necessity as I was desperately looking for such a package during another project and since I was not able to find one, why not make one myself. So presenting es-indexer (Elasticsearch indexer) which can be used to index `json` files to Elasticsearch efficiently. The package will use concurrency and multiprocessing to index the files.

I understand how cool it feels to open up a project like this, get code actually working and feel like you accomplished something cool even when you did use a tutorial. Congratulations on even getting it working, and furthermore if you made alterations that improved it in some way (or for your own purposes). I've been learning C# lately and just picking up syntax is hard but it's always awesome to see that code come to life and actually do what you wanted to do.

It is a unicursal maze. There is one path between any two points. So one could erase any two walls to make an entrance and exit.
I imagine they use something much more efficient.

No such thing as “best” for everyone. Consider Spyder (the beta 4.0.0b1 is excellent). It’s clean and built on python. A bit of bear to install from sources (using pip). I also use VScode - ultimately configurable, which is both a blessing and a curse. Eclipse (gasp) with Pydev is still quite good, but a resource hog.r
i can pm it to you. the first two or three sections are copied but everything else i did on my own. i used the tutorial everybody linked to learn how to get the basic jumping mechanics down, and modified from there
Great stuff, thank you! I will look forward this video when scraping for the first time!

VS Code
Agree in the vscode suggestion or switch to Pycharm. Learning a new IDE isn't that big of an issue of you are already familiar with what tools to look for. 
I actually prefer your color scale over viridis for aesthetics. It reminds me of traditional Japanese paintings, like this one: https://www.pinterest.co.uk/pin/527624912574120064/
The best IDE for Python is Pycharm. A great code editor for light Python development is VS Code.
Right. On a \*table ID column\*.
Ok fair enough, but what do you mean by "use numpy arrays with other c libraries", can you give an example of what you would like to do with other c libraries which numpy can't already do itself? 
Well that makes sense that /someone/ is going to get notified. We've had sequence issues on some of ID columns, its...fun
I've never seen anything like that in the Python world, or anywhere else for that matter. Looks cool. Nagare (www.nagare.org) does a good job of separating the model from the validator but it doesn't have all of the concepts that Trailblazer does.
You should have mentioned that, that you got most from a yt tutorial. Pyautogui aint a starter thing. 
You should try pipenv/poetry, it stores venv’s to the special folder in HOME and project folders looks clearly.
I tend to use Atom, I have a belief that python is something that should be easy and quick to write and simple to handle. Atom does exactly that, it is simple and lightweight and is good enough for me.
If you're used to full IDEs and want to continue with them, then probably PyCharm. That said, I do believe visual studio has some python functionality, though I'm not sure how much or how complete 
Does that work for python3?

You can search for clean architecture topic. It's about separating business logic from I/O, like views or db. So you can use then any validation, web or db framework instead of one all-in-one product. 
Beep Boop Rome (Latin and Italian: Roma [ˈroːma] (listen)) is the capital city and a special comune of Italy (named Comune di Roma Capitale). Rome also serves as the capital of the Lazio region. With 2,872,800 residents in 1,285 km2 (496.1 sq mi), it is also the country's most populated comune. It is the fourth-most populous city in the European Union by population within city limits. It is the centre of the Metropolitan City of Rome, which has a population of 4,355,725 residents, thus making it the most populous metropolitan city in Italy.

How do you represent a maze as a graph?
Basically, just converting from numpy arrays to C arrays more easily, although I'm sure there are features I haven't come across yet. And there are plenty of specialized libraries in a number of industries that perform some obscure algorithm, or reads data from a device, or was written by some engineer 10 years ago with no comments and is still needed in some process. 
I store a project's virtualenv in the root of the project directory. I always call it venv, and then I have venv excluded from version control via .gitignore.

If it's reading the whole thread it might take a while. 😂
The reason for viridis is not an aesthetically one: see these articles: https://matplotlib.org/users/colormaps.html the following ones deal with the bane of my existance as a phd student right now who sometimes deals with the visualization of 2d simulations. many tools and people use jet. https://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2014/10/16/how-bad-is-your-colormap/ https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/223315/why-use-colormap-viridis-over-jet many people love using blue to red colormaps for visualization. this can also be misleading as it also doesn’t go from a bright to a dark color. bottom line for viridis, inferno and co: a colormap that has a linear increase of the brightness is very well readable. a nice side effect: it’s also readable if printed in b/w (important for scientific journals because nobody wants to pay for colored figures). and colorblind people (i’ve read up to 10% of the male population iirc) also won’t have issues Also /u/madducks

thanks for the help! (note that Slack isn't the point but a source to chat with people in the community)
I see, so if I understand correctly a numpy array has a C API but without using the API (e.g. with cython) it just remains a python object? 
/usr/local/envs/ on the server. ~/.virrualenvs/ for development.
I believe the book is actually based on some online articles of similar content the author made that you might find somewhere.
Also A* because of the heuristics are always searching for some specific goal. It would not work for visualizing all the closest paths like Dijkstra's/BFS does in this visualization.
A* is only an improvement when you solve the single-source-path problem. Not like in OP's animations where you find all shortest paths from/to some node.
You will love that Mazes for Programmers book.
There isn't really anything much more efficient than Dijkstra's in general (A* and other similar like IDA* for specific problems when only calculating a single path, but not guaranteed to run faster, just often do), but they can probably do some trickery with pre-calculation and insane parallell calculations.
Horrendously slow if you want to fill the maze with all shortest paths to/from start like that. Why A* is a waste of CPU if you for instance make a TBS and want to display all tiles a selected unit can move to. A* is definitely not "Dijkstra's but faster" as many seem to think. It is not even guaranteed to always find a single shortest path faster than Dijkstra's can. If you have some tricky terrain and can not come up with a good heuristic function A* will be slower.
To be clear, we're hitting the limit of my understanding of something I haven't used in about a year, but what I believe happens is that it makes it easy to use a numpy array directly in C like code without having to copy it or do any other operations. It can be manipulated directly, rather than having to create a new array to pass in, then reversing that process when the C code is done with it. One thing I just remembered is that cython automatically does bounds checks on numpy arrays, but you can turn this off with a decorator, along with wrap around indexing (negative indexes). This gives you literal C speed array indexing for whatever custom algorithm you need to write but can't make vectorized.
Others have already mentioned the best IDEs out there. I'd just like to point out that python may be quite different from other languages you've been working with in .NET. I have never used an IDE since I switched to Linux 10 years back. I mostly use an editor like vim and command line. I found the best way to learn python is to directly run lines of code in the python interpreter which gives you immediate feedback and allows you to test different variations. You can also try Jupyter notebooks which give you the same functionality on a web browser.

Oh hey, this is an awesome idea. Have you considered maybe building a tree of what consumes what? There are a lot of tools that do this before running the program in languages that support that. (Might be a program that already does what I'm describing -- if so, ignore me!)

Having said that all visualizations are biased by our choice of encodings, so I find the latter nearly impossible to accomplish. Off topic: What do you use for simulations?

Hey, here's your hint! Python only says "math domain error" for sqrt(x) when x is less than zero. That's because the square root of a negative number is not real. (no real number times itself equals a negative number)
Have you tried looking at sets? A set automatically removes duplicates. https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/set
I second that. Read the book or check the author's blog. Wonderful work.
PyCharm for an IDE. But many python programmers prefer to use a well featured editor instead. Sublime, Atom, and vscode are all popular. It's well worth trying them all out and seeing which one you like best. Some are more lightweight than others, faster or slower, more or less customizable, and so on. Whichever one you pick, it's worth looking into adding support for linting in the IDE/Editor once you start feeling comfortable enough in Python to work on anything important.

You need to figure out a way to only take ``sqrt(b**2 - 4*a*c)`` if ``b**2-4*a*c`` is not negative. I see you already have some if statements that already do this, but they operate on ``quad`` and not ``b**2-4*a*c``. Maybe you should change them and build ``quad`` somewhere else.
If you generate a name, and then check if it already exists in the list before adding it? And if it does exist, generate a new one and then add it? Could that work?

Beep Boop In computing, a hardware random number generator (HRNG) or true random number generator (TRNG) is a device that generates random numbers from a physical process, rather than by means of an algorithm. Such devices are often based on microscopic phenomena that generate low-level, statistically random "noise" signals, such as thermal noise, the photoelectric effect, involving a beam splitter, and other quantum phenomena. These stochastic processes are, in theory, completely unpredictable, and the theory's assertions of unpredictability are subject to experimental test. This is in contrast to the common paradigm of pseudo-random number generation commonly implemented in computer programs or cryptographic hardware. A hardware random number generator typically consists of a transducer to convert some aspect of the physical phenomena to an electrical signal, an amplifier and other electronic circuitry to increase the amplitude of the random fluctuations to a measurable level, and some type of analog to digital converter to convert the output into a digital number, often a simple binary digit 0 or 1.
Beep Boop Selenium is a portable framework for testing web applications. Selenium provides a playback (formerly also recording) tool for authoring functional tests without the need to learn a test scripting language (Selenium IDE). It also provides a test domain-specific language (Selenese) to write tests in a number of popular programming languages, including C#, Groovy, Java, Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby and Scala. The tests can then run against most modern web browsers. Selenium deploys on Windows, Linux, and macOS platforms.
Beep Boop Yerevan ( YERR-ə-VAHN; Armenian: Երևան [jɛɾɛˈvɑn] (listen), sometimes spelled Erevan) is the capital and largest city of Armenia as well as one of the world's oldest continuously inhabited cities. Situated along the Hrazdan River, Yerevan is the administrative, cultural, and industrial center of the country. It has been the capital since 1918, the fourteenth in the history of Armenia and the seventh located in or around the Ararat plain. The city also serves as the seat of the Araratian Pontifical Diocese; the largest diocese of the Armenian Apostolic Church and one of the oldest dioceses in the world.The history of Yerevan dates back to the 8th century BC, with the founding of the fortress of Erebuni in 782 BC by king Argishti I at the western extreme of the Ararat plain. Erebuni was "designed as a great administrative and religious centre, a fully royal capital." By the late ancient Armenian Kingdom, new capital cities were established and Yerevan declined in importance.

You could also do this using itertools. import itertools as it import random m_name_list = ["James", "John", "Robert", "Michael", "William"] l_name_list = ["Smith", "Johnson", "Williams", "Jones", "Brown"] prod = it.product(m_name_list, l_name_list) names = list(it.combinations(prod, 5)) random.shuffle(names) choice = int(random.uniform(0, len(names))) names[choice] 
Wow so helpful... I'm new to this subreddit so i didn't know -_- obviously.
Why doesn't your ide handle this automatically? What tools are you using?
Instead of comparing equality, you could create a collection of all possible combinations of these names, then just pick 5 combinations at random. The appropriate method would depend on your exact needs and restrictions. itertools.product() can generate this kind of list.
Oh thanks for the subreddit suggestion! I should learn to read sidebar
Interesting. Think it's gonna be above my head. I wanted to try to muck with using keys to navigate. Best I could get... [https://i.gyazo.com/1b700cd7cc766c0749510ddc56c974e3.mp4](https://i.gyazo.com/1b700cd7cc766c0749510ddc56c974e3.mp4) :D lol. 
I'm currently creating a tool that can automatically update user flairs that are based on a title in a google Drive document using GoogleDrive API and PRAW. It's been kinda fun so far since I've not really used python for this sort of thing before.

This is exactly my answer.
Both of these snippets are wrong, as either thread could yield the GIL at any moment. Depending on the Python version, you're witnessing either a timing difference or a difference in complexity. In Python 3, threads yield after a fixed number of milliseconds. In Python 2, threads yield after a fixed number of opcodes. You will find that if you pad out your right-hand example with a sufficient amount of work, it will degrade to the same as the left-hand example You will probably also find that you can make the left-hand example behave like the right-hand example by padding it out too. On Python 2 this behaviour is quite deterministic -- you just need to land on the right number of ops. In either case, your global data should be protected by a lock. There really is no way around it. Either thread can release the GIL at arbitrary moments, and so that global data is otherwise completely unsynchronized.
The most consistently difficult time I had with converting a laboratory data sampler/analyzer suite was communicating with external processes and keeping straight whether they were input/output as bytes/strings. The majority needed to be converted to bytes (because *who knows* what encoding is used out in the wild world of subprocesses - one presumes). But there are apparently random exceptions where the library does the conversion for you. So be ready to go bytes&lt;-&gt;strings on input and output, .encode() and .decode(), and around the regular expression bush. Oh, and consider adding a "universal_newlines=True" parameter to all your process.communicate(...) calls if you want strings.
How is this different then a virtualenv?
You can almost tell the exact moment his CPU begins to strain.
If your set is the combination of first + last and you iterate until there are the number of characters you need I think that should handle it?

Thanks! The darker blue represents the furthest known point from the starting point, the center in this animation. Lighter blue up to white represents closer points. Each step of the alorithm, what it does it goes to all the nearest grid cells it can. That is now the furthest known point. n + 1. Then it goes to the next available squares from all the previous squares, and that is now the furthest known point, n+2. So that square will now be darker than the square before it. And so on until the maze is filled, and we have a map of the distance of all points from the center. Note that the maze itself has a bias revealed. The paths strongly tend to go up and down. This animation was created in python using three libraries to do the drawing. pillow to make the drawings. imageio to turn the individual drawings into an animated gif. &amp;#x200B; My implementation is based on the one in the book [Mazes for Programmers](https://pragprog.com/book/jbmaze/mazes-for-programmers), which was written in Ruby. I strongly recommend reading the book, even though it wasn't written in python, if you have an interest in making images like this.
Maybe, but I don't think so as it is not related to "learning" 
Violating TOS to scrape is in itself not necessarily illegal or unethical, since TOS is simply a contract and it's not illegal, or always unethical, to break a contract - it's what you do with the information that's important. I'm also assuming the TOS is all of legal, ethical and enforcable in the first place, which is not always true. I would suggest leaving the legal issues to the actual lawyers. Quoting case precdents doesn't help if one doesn't understand the exact points covered in each or which jurisdictions they cover.
I was quoting legal cases in relevant to the discussion in that thread, i.e. that the ToS were not enforceable and that you can't copyright data. In the cases quoted there - the arrangement of data scraped was considered copyright infringement, or the ToS was enforced by legal means. Overall what I'm hearing here is that the scraping activity I am asking about doesn't operate in good faith relative to the ToS or legalities involved. Most of that seems to be due to a general disagreement over what can or should be controlled access to data, regardless of what the content owner has to say about it. Hence the "sketchy scripts" in the post title. 
Does anyone have a PEP or a source for (2)?
Literally no one else has submitted this as a solution, and it isn’t the one that’s recommended on any virtual environment tutorials I’ve seen so I’m not sure what you mean lol 
&gt;I store a project's virtualenv in the root of the project directory. I always call it venv, and then I have venv excluded from version control via .gitignore. It's simple and easy to keep track of things, since everything for the project is under one directory. Never had a need to do it another way. Just use the [global .gitignore](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7335420/global-git-ignore)
I thought a mysql date is returned as a string? So `strptime` not `strftime`? I could be wrong here. Please move your credentials to a separate file and read them in from disk. If you don't, you increase the risk of an embarassing accident.
Small Git/Github comment: use a `.gitignore` for `__pycache__`. as you are not supposed to commit Python bytecode.
Will do, thanks!
I'd be super interested to know what others are doing here as well, since I don't think how to structure analyses is a solved question, most people I've worked with have their own ideas. I've toyed with a few approaches (splitting up into files, project-specific libraries etc.) but nothing really seems worth the effort compared to just having a big script\* since this stuff is inherently procedural. I've heard of people using packages like [Luigi](https://github.com/spotify/luigi) to automate workflows, but that's only going to be worth it if you're running the same analysis hundreds of times. &amp;#x200B; \*Of course, you can and should refactor out parts of your code that are truly reusable between analyses, and here I think any conventional paradigm would apply.
Do you mean opencv-contrib with SURF etc? If yes, it works fine with "pip install opencv-contrib-python"

Oh man.. I was trying for a long time to implement Dijkstra and A* :) I tried to do that with Java and failed. Will try again with Python...
Yeah, it’s kinda cumbersome. Gets very flexible once you transfer the data to a Pandas dataframe, though. 
I just let pipenv handle it for me. I know a lot of people here don't like pipenv, and I've definitely run into some weird bugs with it, but it's worked pretty well for me in the past few months.
There is a free RL course that is very practical and can get you started on deep reinforcement learning using python [https://github.com/yandexdataschool/Practical\_RL](https://github.com/yandexdataschool/Practical_RL)

Yes, but it's an example of a "race condition", ie. what _not_ to do.
I use Anaconda, so I can list and access them from any directory without having to remember their paths. As a bonus, I can create virtual environments with different versions of python using the same base version of python. Anaconda is great. You should use it.

As an alternative approach, use numpy.random.seed(x) — absolutely works across different versions— which is great, thank you whoever worked that requirement in. 
What do you mean?
That sounds cool. I'm surprised something like this doesn't already exist, either as an official format from Native Instruments, or as an open source project.
I do something similar, locally use virtualenvwrapper, (~/.virtualenvs), on server I use /usr/share/appname/venv Though these days I will run the app in a docker compose environment locally, the ~/.virtualenvs has just become for PyCharm code analysis only. Seems a bit dumb, I'm installing the app twice I guess. Once for dev in docker, and once to aid PyCharm.
 import sys if __name__ == "__main__": # do stuff with `sys.argv`
If your virtualenv or docker isn’t setup you need access to internet to set it up. Otherwise simply set activate an existing virtualenv or start an existing container does not require internet

* Please post questions in /r/LearnPython. * Please upload a GitHub Gist or Pastebin paste of your code so we can understand exactly what you want. There's probably a very simple way to do the thing you want to achieve, but it's difficult to tell just from your brief, code-less description. If you're just trying to call a function repeatedly and do something with its return value, you can do something like this: ``` def get_total(): total = calculate_total_somehow() return total def main(): x = 3 accumulator = 0 # Loop x times for _ in range(x): total = get_total() accumulator += total print("Accumulator:", accumulator) if __name__ == "__main__": main() ```

I use VS Code, and the trend, especially for dynamic languages like JavaScript/TypeScript and Python, seems to be going in the VS Code direction.
I think this belongs in r/learnpython, but I'm not a mod so not my job. &amp;#x200B; It sounds like you're expecting variables assigned in your function to be accessible from the global namespace after you return them. That's not how return works, so here's a short example: &amp;#x200B; def my\_function(): return 10 &amp;#x200B; def other\_function(): value = my\_function() # now value == 10 print(value) # prints 10 &amp;#x200B; The key is that you have to assign the return value of the function to a new variable. If you're doing something like: &amp;#x200B; def my\_function(): counter = 10 return counter &amp;#x200B; my\_function() print(counter) &amp;#x200B; This doesn't work because your call to my\_function() just discards the return value since you haven't assigned it to a variable. The counter variable is only accessible inside of my\_function, but it does return the value of that variable so that you can assign it to something new.

If these are small scripts, OO is probably overkill. Read CSV, make some graphs, generate SQL--that's like 300 lines, maybe? I also tend to avoid OO when I'm solving a problem for the first time. I don't trust myself to decompose the problem into objects the right way the first time. Once I understand the "verbs" of a problem (i.e. what operations need to happen), I'll understand the subjects and objects. I almost always end up rewriting anyway, so the second time around is when I do some OO, if then.
I've heard about of negative about pyenv and last I tried poetry it was more effort than I wanted. I put the virtual env in a hidden folder called .venv at the project root and then use the excellent direnv to automatically activate whenever I cd into the project. It's magical
The anaconda distribution is big, all of numpy/scipy/etc, plus Jupyter, etc. If you want just a minimal installation download miniconda. Just conda and python.
I have the same problem on my machine: I run the code in jupyter notebook with no problem, but it reports this error in python. you can commit out the two lines: root= tk.TK() root.withdraw() this should work well
Thanks alot, i will check!
\[\*\] &gt;To be clear: This isn’t to say CPython is bad, or even that it should necessarily change. In fact, as I’ll show, **dumb bytecode compilers are par for the course**. In the past I’ve lamented how the Emacs Lisp compiler could do a better job, but CPython and Lua are operating at the same level. There are benefits to a dumb and straightforward bytecode compiler: the compiler itself is simpler, easier to maintain, and more amenable to modification (e.g. as Python continues to evolve). It’s also easier to debug Python (pdb) because it’s such a close match to the source listing. &amp;#x200B;
Thanks! I will search more about clean architecture, it seems to me a good place to start!
There's not really a need to change your git config for this, the default path `~/.config/git/ignore` works out of the box as a user-level gitignore file.
There is a list of capabilities currently supported shown in the Readme file for each port of PySimpleGUI. The Readme for PySimpleGUIWeb is on PyPI or the [GitHub site](https://github.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI/tree/master/PySimpleGUIWeb). The most recent addition was Images. Clearly missing are Tables. I'm still getting educated on Remi and what it's capable of as well as how to best map that to the PySimpleGUI universe. 
For the security stuff, a locksmith and a safe-cracker have the same skills and learn them the same way. Likewise there are people scraping for commerical use but I don't think it's fair to say everyone is doing it. Some of the scrapers here seem to be educational projects. I don't think it's fair to call either "sketchy" just because of what they do. Finally, remember that not everoyne is covered by United States law or that country's unique code of ethics.
I mean the issue isn't the install size, it's that you were saying Microsoft had nothing to do with conda and it pretty clearly does since VSCode is being pushed on people who go to install anaconda. VSCode is open source but it's still written and maintained by Microsoft. It seems like a fine IDE so I have nothing against it, but [here](https://www.anaconda.com/vs-code-in-anaconda-distribution-5-1/) you can even see they announced a partnership with Microsoft to allow them to bundle it in the installer.
This assumes that the *dis* module gives *the* end result, executed bytecode. It's possible that the *dis* module simple returns the simple disassembly of the code, and the interpreter has more smarts for just in time optimization.
This assumption would be correct for cpython.
https://i.imgur.com/PX1lWDc.png
The title is misleading; this is an exploration of three bytecode compilers (CPython, Lua, Emacs Lisp) and which sorts of optimizations they do or don't perform at compile time. The "dumb" designation means that these compilers *don't* do a ton of optimizations, but mostly produce bytecode that's a literal operation-by-operation translation of the source code. As far as I'm aware, CPython's bytecode compiler is this way deliberately. Part of it is that there aren't a ton of provably-safe compile-time optimizations you can do to Python to begin with. Part of it is keeping the compiler simpler to maintain (CPython also has some *runtime* optimizations, for what it's worth).
Could you do some optimisation on the bytecode before it gets executed by the interpreter?

I tend to use Python as glue code, preprocessing and preparing data for more complex programs in Python or other languages/frameworks. In thst context, I find the OO programming is useful when you need to slice the same data multiple ways. If I need to make multiple computations on different subsets of the same data, writing a class usually pays off. Otherwise, scripting style is sufficient. For certain applications, functools and a functional style will make your code so much more concise. Learning the map/reduce pattern and folding will go a long way. As others have mentioned, writing well-organized code with useful comments is important if you or anyone else will be using the code again. The DRY principle always applies. Another hard-learned lesson is that while it is helpful at first to have verbose, labeled output, it is almost always the opposite when you actually need to do something with that output. That is, it's great for debugging to have labels interleaved with data, but it's a headache if I want to feed that data into another program. For that reason, I include a logging mode that I can toggle off after development is complete.
Working on my a web application in Flask. While also learning data structures and algorithms. 
I prefer pyenv to anaconda (much *much* lighter weight). That said, on the day-to-day I don't need to change interpreters, and a venv is fine. If just using a venv, I create a parent project directory, which is handy for misc files and reduces clutter in the working tree. Like this: `project/` ` &lt;venv dirs&gt;/` ` src/` ` .git/` Then there is `xonsh vox`[1] which has its own benefits and drawbacks. [1] https://xon.sh/
Do you have any good recommendations for software engineering books?

I've never done what you described, but it sounds like something that might be feasible through [multiprocessing](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/multiprocessing.html?highlight=process) and [snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial/tutorial.html)

I was thinking more of what if you need to download your project to a different machine. For example, you originally used a apple computer, but need to use a linux (if switching computers with a different operating system actually works), will that scenario be completely fine?
Nice job! In which IDE/Editor you did it?
Hey thats really nice ! It says that I have to donate to download the python source file, it’ll be helpful for others if you can upload a brief video on what libraries you used and how you made this fantastic game :)
In both circumstances your internet access is required. 
I use the default Python IDE. It gets the job done. xD
Click "No thanks, just take me to the downloads." It's free lol.
&gt;https://xkcd.com/1987 I wonder if this is an understatement? LOL
Wow, I'm not sure if that shows dedication or stubbornness. Either way it obviously works for you.
Oh sick! Fantastic job man!
Alright.
Lambda when used with map and filter can actually shorten a lot of your code You can see the differenece between using normal functions vs lambda and map here - [Python Filter With Lambda](https://uiv.me/blog/2019/02/23/python-filter/) The difference is 6 lines condense into 3 neat and easy to debug lines of code.
More stubbornness than anything else. Although it's pretty quick to start up unlike most IDEs. Also, since there's no realtime error checking (not sure what it's called), I rarely syntax related mistakes, which is nice.
&gt; I rarely syntax related mistakes I love the irony. I get not wanting to use Pycharm or similar, but something like Visual Studio Code is just a advanced text editor, and it's fast. Highly recommended.
Every function object has an attached code object containing the actual bytecode CPython will execute (the code object is the attribute `__code__` on the function, the bytecode is the attribute `co_code` of the code object). You can compare that to the output of `dis.dis()` and see that they're the same.
Don’t be gay
One of the other reasons I stick to the default IDE is because I know it's simple and reliable. I've heard many stories from other devs about their IDEs causing issues (usually with their libraries). I'll probably switch to a normal IDE at some point. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

This is not really python-specific. You
Beautiful! Great work!
I agree. Proper object oriented code is hard to do right the first time around unless proper planning has been done. 
As you suggest, launching a number of separate instances of a script rather than using threads is, indeed, the right approach because of the PIL. This means that what you are looking for isn’t really Python-specific at all. A controller for a varying number of processes is something quite generic. You can cast a wider net in your search.

Just began a class learning Python and I am very invested in creating a text RPG based on the lore of the band King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard. I am constantly looking up more efficient ways to add items to inventories, areas to explore and places inside those areas and such. I have really enjoyed learning python so far and very driven to complete this project of mine.
Great work! Good luck in new beginnings 
In what way? Like the IDE doesn't detect certain external libraries and doesn't provide linting/autocompletion for them? Never had that happen with pycharm nor vscode
i wonder how many people on itch actually end up donating because they assume they have to
those casting animations are so freaking cool
Not sure, I don't really ask about it lol.
People have issues with pycharm as it sets up virtual environments for projects which is confusing if you’re not familiar with them. VSCode is more of a straight text editor (plus goodies) and doesn’t get involved with the environment as much. I do typically run code by alt tabbing to the terminal though, and it is nice how IDLE lets you execute the code really easily. 
How recently did you play Hyper Light Drifter? 
Around 5 or 6 months ago. Why? xD
I messed around a bit with Pygame maybe 5 or 6 years ago, and it seemed like it hadn't really been updated for a while. Has it changed recently? I've seen it popping up here more often in the past few months. 
Just convert you input to int or float, because for now it's str. You can't do math with type of str. a = int(input(...)) b = int(input(...)) c = int(input(...))
Oh, no reason. :D Your game looks awesome. I can’t imagine putting it together in 48 hours. 
No, but Pygame 2 is in the works. It's based on SDL2 (rather than SDL). It'll finally have fully supported hardware acceleration on top of many other features then.
You posted this to r/python instead of r/learnpython
I've been trying to convince the person running itch to change the "No thanks" link to be more visible. Since he gets money from a most of the sales (you can set it to a 0% share to itch.io, altho most people to 10%), I doubt he'll change it. When somebody accidentally donates for something that's free, it mostly just affects the developer's reputation, so itch doesn't have much to gain by fixing that.
CPython already does that, but it's very conservative in its optimisations, see https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Python/peephole.c
That's good to know! I might try it out again when 2 comes out.
I like VS codium, because it does not try to steal your data
Did you try to add debug printouts to your bot to figure out if/where the incoming message got stuck? Sorry if I'm stating the obvious.
Hm would a web app fit your criteria? You have your your own process, but you also a make a minimal web app (flask eg) that starts your job. Also you can make a simple rest api or ui to fire the basic processes. 
looks awesome, and fun, but that display top right is too big!

Nice - did you make the graphics yourself?
Any chance this was inspired by Gungeon? Looks great! 
If you are about to ask a "how do I do this in python" question, please try r/learnpython
Very nice! I'm working on a small game myself and I gotta ask, how did you do the pixel art? What program did you use?
Looks like it was inspired by Wizard of Legend. Good job.

I've been messing around with arcade python but I lost interest thinking I couldnt really make anything cool without a c language.... youve re-inspired me :D Thanks for sharing man
Awesome work! Would love to see this as a full game tho!
Everything would have been fine if you had written "followed a guide to make this cool game" etc. etc. The dishonesty is that you purposely, with your title, made it out to sound like you conjured up this little wacky thing, while you didn't. But don't be discouraged, I think it's cool that you did it :) I'm only having a whack at the dishonesty, as it discourages other newbies if they see "simple projects just being whipped up", do you know what I mean?
Fake. Didn't see stack overflow once
How could you come up with this in such little time :O
LOL, hindi and mandarin coming soon (the other 50%)! [https://snips.ai/enterprise/](https://snips.ai/enterprise/) &amp;#x200B;
Yeah. I’ve been using Python3 and Pygame for over a year and haven’t put together anything as good as this! Maybe I should scale it down...
You probably want to use Requests and/or beautifulsoup for scraping. In terms of then putting the data in Excel then this may be a good place to start: https://automatetheboringstuff.com/chapter12/
The only thing I hate about game programming is the art so I refuse to touch it. 
Nice work!
Most of the scientific stack (I'd say all, but just to cover the edge case) already works with Python 3 (and some modules are dropping 2 support). Other than the differences in the language and the semantics of a few things that changed (the bytes/string thing is maybe one of the hardest), you shouldn't find too much trouble. In my case, the thing that pushed me over Python 3.6 was a project that needed the latest tensorflow and it was a mess to make it run on our environment under 2.7, but with 3.6 it was a breeze. After that project we convinced the upper layer that every project would benefit\* and we ported the rest of the projects. &amp;#x200B; \* it may not have really been the case, but it made it easier for everyone in the lab to work with just one version of python
If you are a complete beginner, and if you also see other potential ways to use some Python skills, then starting at the beginning of [Automate the boring stuff](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) would be a good idea. My advice is: * Have realistic expectations - it may take a long time to get this working, far longer than doing it by hand once or twice. * Take the time to learn the programming basics that might not seem related to solving your problem. It is easy to try to 'short cut' these by jumping straight to the bits that look like they solve your problem. This is like someone who wants to learn French in order to be able understand French legal documents, so decides to skip all the irrelevant lower level stuff like "Hello my name is..." etc. If this is something that you don't have motivation for, however (e.g. because you won't use these skills again) find a freelancer to do it for you, on somewhere like [upwork.com](https://www.upwork.com/) or [freelancer.com](https://www.freelancer.com/). 
The thing about jit compilers such as Numba is that they are great when they recognize the types and optimize, but if not, you are in the dark, and cannot do much more than changing your code a little to hit the sweet spot. In Cython, you can target the bottlenecks deliberately, by profiling and optimizing with type annotations etc., without the need for trying to read the compiler's mind.
Really cool!
&gt;heard a lot of bad stuff about free courses If you are going to join the world of programming, learn to get real specific. Specificity is king, everything else is vague bullshit.

I was mad no one upvoting, came back hours later and I am proud of you python folk
It would take me 48 months to make something like this :'(
Have you taken any courses/tutorials on art?
Thank you Django, I do see this might be a huge project to begin with. What would you advice to begin with? I was thinking to start with extracting titles and continue from there. The idea on how it should eventually work is in my head, the only thing is to get it to work... Anyway my boss is chill about me working on it. I have been given an oppertunity to start working on it, regardless the time it takes or if it works.. There might be a huge learning curve ahead of me! So I will take your advice and start at the beginning. Also, when I get stuck (and I know I will) I know where to find you guys! 
To be clear: The application does not create a mapping for you in Traktor. The trick is that you create a mapping (.tsi) once, but then afterwards get to work with objects in the python code. So I have: - controller objects, which - consists out of components, that - are made up by elements. And: - Clients, which - consist out of components, that - are made up by elements. Therefore, I can map components from a controller (like encoder groups, for instance) to components in the client software, without altering the controller mapping or client mapping, thereby achieving proper abstraction. pseudo: ```m1 = Mapper(bcr.components['encoder_group_1'], traktor.components['fx1'])``` bcr is instance of Controller traktor is instance of Client The Mapper object takes elements or components as an input and has a build method to create a routing. The routing is passed to a Routing table object. The Routing table is passed to RtMidi. RtMidi captures the bytes and forwards + translates according to the Routing Table. Now, we have built en mapping but it is pretty basic. We can get funky (and this is the part I still have to build) by adding state tables and advanced mappings. For instance: map: ***cc 1, channel 1, 0 - 31 -&gt; cc 1, channel 1, 15 - 31*** Why is this useful, one may ask. Well, because FX presets and desired behaviour. Maybe I daisy chain some delays and map all delay times to a single encoder. If I create a simple direct mapping, the relative delay times will get fucked up when I adjust the value. By creating a translation I can control the exact output value for each input value. Therefore, the delay times are always sensible..
Sounds like RotMG to me.
Amazing game!
https://www.pygame.org/docs/ was used a couple times tho.
&gt; VSCode &gt; Electron &gt; Fast I use Vim btw
good bot
He did
Well if you coded with no docs I'd be thoroughly confused
Hadn’t heard of it before. I looked it up tho. Looks pretty cool, but I don’t see the similarities.
I’ve been using Pygame for 5 years, so I can whip something together pretty fast.
Cool, what GUI lib did you use?
Then you won’t ever learn to do it. :( My artwork used to look like this: https://dafluffypotato.github.io/dat/img/art_progress/img_0.png
That does make sense, although I specifically meant in the case where one is typing pure python. That should be a more easily directly comparable situation.
I learned Python first and I’ve used it more. Also, it’s incredibly fast for development (as in adding features). 
Yep. If you look at the timelapse, I did most of them in MS Paint too.
A little bit of gungeon, yes. Also a bit of this: https://mobile.twitter.com/ittas_gun
No. I just looked at other people’s art. I’ve improved a lot, but I think I would’ve improved more if I had used tutorials. At this point, I’m not that sure where to look to get better. Most tutorials are pretty basic.
He is one with the code.
MS Paint for static images and [my own tool](https://cmlsc.itch.io/px-editor) for a couple animations.
Deadline in 4 days: good luck; I've spent multiple days and bought a book just to get PyQts model-view to work.
Realm of the mad god eske
Any chance Wizard of Legend had some influence on this?
No, but someone else mentioned it. After looking up some pics, I’m not seeing similarities. Is there something I’m missing?
Just Pygame.
Ah okay. I was always under the impression that Python was too slow to make sufficient games. Good to know that it worked for you!
Just reminds of the boss fights a bit. Not too similar! Was just curious if it might have had some influence, since it came to mind when seeing your game. Yours looks great though, bravo!!
Qt has drag and drop GUI creation tools. I have never used it from Python though, so I can't speak to how easy they are to set up.
They may be drag and drop.... But you still have to know what you are doing as you then need to figure out how to tie the form to the code.... The drag and drop easy tool is very much a double edged sword. Source: found it out the hard way. 
The code is still being updated, not sure about the hardware, but you can run it on a ESP8266 board if you want - there are tons of them available online.
Sounds like you can get it done in a day with PySimpleGUI if all it does is pop up windows and asks for filenames. There is a single button to browse for a file / files or folder. You didn't mention where it run however. PySimpleGUI runs best on Windows or Linux. Mac has some issues due to tkinter issues. Look in the [Cookbook](http://cookbook.PySimpleGUI.org) to get started immediately and to see the code running in your browser. Pretty sure there's an example or two in there that allow you to select a file. If not, check the [GitHub](http://www.PySimpleGUI.com) in the example programs section and you'll find many examples that you can copy, paste and modify. &amp;#x200B;
Have you ever actually used VS Code? It's _fast_.
That is amazing! How much time do you usually need to plan thing like this? &amp;#x200B;
There was a talk about Micropython at this years CCC Congress (35C3) - iirc there was a new board presented
This thread may be useful for you https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/anpkle/how_to_make_a_desktop_gui_application_in_python
Did you try talking to your Sysadmins? If you need Python for your job they should give you access. 
This was supposed to be a joke but ok...
PyQt was kind of it, but the dual GPL/commercial license was a problem for many people. Now that The Qt Company revived their own official Qt for Python bindings under the LGPL, it's not really a problem anymore.
The issue is "batteries included" so confusion arises when the batteries (Tkinter) aren't fully charged. &gt; is a gui library is really that hard to make? GUI means different things to different people. Qt and WxPython might be fine for desktop applications but they're inadequate for high quality multi-media presentations and game development, and they don't have a very Pythonic API.

Lol that would be a good plan except I don't "need it" so to speak. My job is route Excel tasks, I just want to install numpy (matplotlib, pandas) so I can effectively automate my job. The issue with this is everyone on my team is non-tech and if my boss needed to approve she'd be like tf are you doing.
Redis has a Pub/Sub option which you can combine with Twisted to produce a non-blocking event loop: https://github.com/deldotdr/txRedis/blob/master/examples/pubsub.py 
Amazing! can you share how you are working on Data Structures and Algorithms? (Course of action, MOOC's or any other source?) I am also trying to learn them but so many resources on the internet overwhelm me as "how should I start this is too big to begin with" dilemma. 
USB stick? PythonAnywhere or repl.it on the cloud? 
I think I spent 2 hours planning everything out. I used to spend about 30 minutes, but that lead to more unforeseen design issues.
USB might work 🤔 I've been using repl.it in browser to learn the Python basics. Also I can "run" Python on visual studio like I said. The issue is I don't think I can manipulate Excel data on my computer since I can't install any packages. 
Here's a nice list of open source GUI libraries for you.... [https://wiki.python.org/moin/GuiProgramming](https://wiki.python.org/moin/GuiProgramming) This goal has been tried a few times" "a high demand for a easy to use, powerful and open source gui library" This is exactly that thinking that prodded me into writing [PySimpleGUI](http://www.PySimpleGUI.org). I saw no GUI library that was easy AND powerful. Not knocking all the other libraries out there, but when I searched, I found none that fit the easy + powerful requirements. PSG attempts to make it easy to access ALL of the widgets available on the platform it's running on (maybe some of the ttk ones not yet completed). For example, all of the tkinter widgets are available and you can get pretty much any layout you want using those same widgets, but in a fraction of the code and complexity. What dominates the main GUI frameworks is an Object-Oriented programming model. While PySimpleGUI uses objects, it does not force nor encourage, the programmer to write classes themselves. The code tends to be quite literal and linear. This brings the required skill level to use the library way down. You don't have to understand OO programming. I don't know of many other open course GUIs that are suitable for absolute beginners that allow you to grow with it and write some sophisticated, multi-window applications. To answer your "is a GUI library hard to make?" - it depends on the architecture and feature list. Some can be not too difficult to make.
It looks similar to the mechanics of wizard of legend! Pretty cool :)
You should use 3.8.0a1 with cloning cpython and compiling it your self.
Of course! :) I'm currently using a book "hands on data structures and algorithms". I'm currently trying to also get matplotlib to run on Ubuntu. But I honestly have no idea haha. So that has also become a mini project. I'm starting with this book and slowly working my way through. 
This looks dope af! Cheers!
I think you need to install the rtree package and also libspatialindex-dev if you are using ubuntu. If you are using conda you can do: conda install -c conda-forge rtree
Hi [u/Enaifes-Kach](https://www.reddit.com/user/Enaifes-Kach), I know this amazing book, "Learn Python, Hard Way" which i referred in my early days. Also , if you are looking for a video course check [this](https://www.edyoda.com/course/98) out. [https://www.edyoda.com/course/98](https://www.edyoda.com/course/98)
Mine was similar on my early games... Until Klik n' Play came out! P.S. There are a lot of places you can get graphics, textures, sprites, etc online that are free to use.
Not sure how relevant, but Adafruit has been pushing their CircuitPython: https://learn.adafruit.com/welcome-to-circuitpython/what-is-circuitpython Ah, it's their own branch of micropython: https://www.adafruit.com/category/956
I think the most sensible way of accomplishing this is with sets: from dataclasses import dataclass from random import choice FIRST_NAMES = ["James", "John", "Robert", "Michael", "William"] LAST_NAMES = ["Smith", "Johnson", "Williams", "Jones", "Brown"] @dataclass(frozen=True) class Character: first_name: str last_name: str characters = set() while len(characters) &lt; 5: characters.add(Character(choice(FIRST_NAMES), choice(LAST_NAMES))) print(characters) Frozen dataclasses are really cool because you can just put them into sets and use them as dictionary keys and everything works as it should. Note that this code will loop forever if there aren't enough names. In this case it's definitely not a problem. The expected number of retries needed are less than 1, but if you want to generate more than 20 or so unique names it's a good idea to add more first names or last names.
They're running Python 2 (see near bottom right of the screen shot) so `input()` actually means `eval(input())` here.
/r/learnpython Also, you should learn to format your code for reddit
Development of MicroPython appears to be continuing - there was a new software release (v1.10) only a month ago. As for hardware, there was [talk 6 months ago](https://forum.micropython.org/viewtopic.php?t=4883) of a "new pyboard" - not sure when that's expected. Unfortunately, however, development of MicroPython does seem to have slowed somewhat recently - perhaps, in part, because the second-largest contributor has had commit access removed and is ["not welcome back as a maintainer"](https://forum.micropython.org/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=4358&amp;sid=c91c50bebfb127817de1bb62b88e9904&amp;start=40#p32394). Part of the problem seems to be a disagreement with MicroPython's founder on the direction of the project - I don't know the details.

Without knowing the type of processing you do, it's hard to say. First thing, auto-scale based on resource availability is generally not done via the program itself. It usually belongs to some kind type of management system. Famous one is [YARN](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-site/YARN.html). The type of processing will largely determine which approach you need to code your application. In general, and since you are using AWS already, I suggest taking a quick look at [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/). While it has its own issues (15 minutes max execution time, etc), it does help you to rapid prototype your design. With Lambda, you can trigger your processing whenever a message hits SQS, you don't need to write polling code, just focus on processing logic. And since AWS Lambda can auto-scale, you can write a bunch of messages to SQS and then trigger a lot of lambda in parallel. 
Scared you'll automate your job away and they'll find out? (; 
Yeah lol or they'll be like you aren't doing what we assigned blah blah ur fired

Is making games your day job? Just asking because this work here is quite inspirational. I would love to study the source code.
That's interesting. Have you observed any performance improvement after porting to Python 3.6? I've heard that 3.6 is faster for many programs than 2.7 and it also has a more efficient (and ordered) dictionary.
If you use IdleX (it's on pypi), there's line numbers and a couple other features that make it slightly less unbearable.
But if you’re installing additional software, why not just install PyCharm? Or VSCode? Or even Notepad++?
Thanks! Yes I've heard that bytes &lt;-&gt; strings is a major pain point for most people. I also have some code that processes text from external sources which can contain unicode so that is another thing of concern. Then there is everything like \`map\`, \`zip\` etc is now returns an iterator instead of lists. But the most important difference for me is probably that you can only use new style classes in python 3. I inherited some legacy code with old style classes so I need to make sure that the new style classes do not break the code.
No, the situation has not changed. Your options are either to dispatch tasks to multiple processes, or use a library written in a different language that has better multiprocessing support.
Would you be willing to coöperate on this project maybe? :-)
Any tips on where to start with PyGame and making your own graphics?

For Pygame: Start with tutorials to learn the basics of Pygame. Then try to figure out how to do x yourself rather than relying on tutorials. (I’m talking about implementing features/mechanics, not the use of Pygame’s functions on their own.) Art: Practice
Lots of free/cheap courses, books, and articles https://github.com/petedannemann/GIS-Programming-Roadmap/blob/master/README.md
Still a hobby cuz I’m a student atm. I’d *like* to do gamedev for a living if I could make ~$30/hr, but based on sales from Super Potato Bruh, I’m getting around $20/hr. The main issue is that it’s not exactly a stable career. xD I’m currently just going in the general direction of computer science.
Any interest in providing sources to some of the best/most useful of these places? I always get so overwhelmed by the amount of options and I don’t really know where to start. 
Thank you ☺️ 
I've been out of game development for almost 5 years now. (My current employer has terms that if I make things outside of work, they'd get ownership of the IP) But! The place I'd start is https://forums.tigsource.com and peek around the art board. There are people that want to get exposure and work together with devs, but their skills are more art-based and not coding-based
Hi there, from the /r/Python mods. We have removed this post as it is not suited to the /r/Python subreddit proper, however it should be very appropriate for our sister subreddit /r/LearnPython or for the r/Python discord: https://discord.gg/3Abzge7.

&gt; I see that python can only use one core The reason is the [GIL](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/init.html#thread-state-and-the-global-interpreter-lock). The GIL still exists in the latest version of python, therefore the limitation is still a thing.
Thank you. Is there a language you'd suggest to to avoid the problem? R?
This guy codes
did you learn pixel art and programming yourself or in collage 
Almost any C-like language would do. I've been tinkering with ML.NET for a bit, and have enjoyed it so far.
What is an "easy to use, powerful and open source gui library" for you? I found PyGObject and Qt for Python easy to use and powerful and they are open source and multi-platform.
thank you :)
Alternative: https://github.com/1and1/debianized-jupyterhub JupyterHub avoids the tunneling and makes this a simple web service (SaaS), and it comes as a package, which is easily uninstalled and upgraded.
Entirely myself. I'm taking a bunch of CS prerequisites and other required classes for an associate's degree. I've taken *one* programming class and it was an intro to C++ class (I already knew the stuff they taught.)
No link to a code repository, no way to add this (whatever it does, because no docs) to a CI pipeline.

switch to PySide2.... Do not know anything better
format your code and go to r/learnpython
PyCharm defaults to setting up a virtual environment for each project. If you aren't aware that is going on, it can be quite frustrating, because a library you have installed and working in terminal won't be available in the PyCharm virtual environment. It is really easy to deal with once you figure out what is happening and can be quite useful in certain situations, but as a beginner it can be really irritating and confusing.
Nice! Looks like a Doctor Strange style spell and is really cool!
Adafruit is also about to launch a new prototype board which features an ESP32 and one other microcontroller, a touch panel, and some other common bells and whistles all intended for circuitpython. It'll probably be relatively pricey but it's still interesting as a general purpose playground and learning gizmo

Some are aimed at the player, some are bursts aimed at the player with slight variation in direction, and others are variations of circular patterns.
I'm assuming u mean code. I generally listen to videogame soundtracks or remixes of them.
I've been using Love2D. I like it a lot better and it has better cross-platform support and easier app deployment. 
Mmmm I see, thank you!
Never hear of it but I'll look it up. I always wanted to make some silly game
QScintilla. It’s an enhanced text editor for PyQt. I like it because there is a lot of documentation. Much of it is in C++, but you don’t have to speak C++ to use it, since you can use the commands and arguments through a generic command, SendScintilla. I find it far less painful than much of the rest of PyQt. Also, it makes things like syntax highlighting very simple. 
I am inclined toward beeware but they are still in development phase. Hope they do well.
Python is slow compared to compiled languages. However, Python can import C/C++ modules, which are compiled an run at their native speed. Over half of Pygame is done via C, which allows it to be reasonably fast in areas it needs to be. 
Started making a chess game yesterday. Plan to use Pygame once i'm that far.
Wait, what about the multiprocessing library? 
cool, my ultimate goal is to automate little stuff(firstly ofc) too.Uh Im hyped
I'm only at the advanced level and use Pycharm by default, but for your scenario, if you ever feel like mixing things up then check out VS Code. It's like a prettier IDLE with a little more QOL features that keeps it's simplicity. I had to use it today due to a problem with my Pycharm and it reinforced how much VS Code excels at what you seem to be looking for.

How come you have a custom `minimum` function instead of just using the built in `min`?

I looked into this a bit just now. Originally I tried `min` because I found it when typing minimum, but it didn't work the way I expected and I didn't care to look it up. Turns out that my "minimum" is basically `max()`.
Hi guys! I am new to Python and this subreddit. I have a PHP background and I have started to dive in Python. I create videos to help me learn and use as a reference if needed.

Bet those 2 leopards were having a hard time with the python. 
dude this looks amazing, gonna download this after work! did you make the art yourself? i have no idea how the art factor works when coding games
Great! Thanks, gonna check it out :)
That's not to bad compared to mine 
Yep, I did it myself. Mostly in MS Paint. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wc0rN6ttu3A
Your dictionary comprehension example is broken. `automatic_dictionary = {key: value for (key, value) in &lt;some_iterable&gt;}my_variable = my_dict['my_nested_dict']` (that is at the end of the dict comprehension you have pasted garbage code from an earlier example). It's also a bad example of a dictionary comprehension. That is if you actually had an iterable of things that can be unpacked into a 2-tuple like `(key, value)`, it's conceptually clearer to just write `new_dict = dict(some_iterable)` than `new_dict = {key: value for (key, value) in some_iterable}`. That is: In [1]: some_iterable = zip(range(10), range(30,50)) In [2]: some_iterable Out[2]: &lt;zip at 0x10bd957c8&gt; In [3]: new_dict = dict(some_iterable) In [4]: new_dict Out[4]: {0: 30, 1: 31, 2: 32, 3: 33, 4: 34, 5: 35, 6: 36, 7: 37, 8: 38, 9: 39} However, it's pretty easy to come up with good examples of dictionary comprehensions, like if you wanted a dictionary of the first ten integer squares int_squares_dict = {n: n**2 for n in range(10)} or going the other way: int_square_roots_dict = {n**2: n for n in range(10)} 
I've avoided them like the plague ever since they pulled that stunt in their sublime(and other) package.

&gt; buy an open source plugin, reward the author for their work, and expose new users to Kite. &gt;We were so blown away by his knowledge of Atom’s APIs and his work on minimap that we hired him. Wow, how scary is this? A business can just buy an open source project or hire a maintainer, and "ethically" inject references to their own software into it and then somehow say that it's not an ad. Sketchy, morally bankrupt, and it's insane that Kite somehow thinks this is an OK thing to do. Never heard of Kite before, but I'll be sure to keep an eye out and steer clear of any project they touch. 
I don't think it's overkill, it's literally the easiest ML task there is and you can download pretrained models with &gt;99% accuracy (search for pretrained MNIST classifier, it's digits 0-9). There will definitely not be an easier way and most likely also non that needs less disk space. Maybe look for keras instead of tensorflow, it's easier to use.

Most people will use some sort of text editor to write their programs in first. There's a whole slew of debate about which is best, but Notepad++ is easy to start out with. Once you write your program, make sure to save it with the .py file extension. Now from command prompt, you can simply run the command: `python` [`filename.py`](https://filename.py) &amp;#x200B;

&gt; Yeah. I’ve been using Python3 and Pygame for over a year and haven’t put together anything as good as this! Maybe I should scale it down... If you want something simple check out pyScripter, pretty lightweight.
Use AWS ECS and its Fargate Feature. Spin up as many containers you need to do the work and when the job completes simply shut them down. You can launch tens or tens of thousands of Docker containers in seconds using Amazon ECS with no additional complexity.
Maybe checkout [r/learnpython](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/?st=JSKVM8XY&amp;sh=5ac09660) 
I didn't know you could download pretrained models. That's fantastic! I also did some looking at keras. Just on the surface, it does look easier. I found what looks to be a pretty good tutorial. Machine learning is very new to me, so anything that makes it easier is appreciated. Thank you for your help! I'll put you in the credits if I ever release this thing! :)
ahh why am i not surprised there's a reddit on it. thanks!
Check out the SoloLearn app. I have it on my Android tablet, and I’m pretty sure they have an iOS version as well. 
Brython can import modules or packages if they are located in the same folder as the Brython application, not in the CPython standard library. Could you open an issue on the [Brython issue tracker](https://github.com/brython-dev/brython/issues) ? For this question, it is more adapted than reddit.
For checking if a key exist in a dictionary and that the associated value is not None, which is faster/better: example_dict.get('key') is not None or 'key' in example_dict and example_dict['key'] is not None
So the file must be a .py file extension and you type python file.py, make sure you are in the same directory as where the file is actually located
Definitely seconded! Sololearn is completely free and very informative. I used to use codeacademy until I stumbled upon sololearn.
Why wouldn't you use Amazon's APIs?
It's simple, but I like [retrying](https://pypi.org/project/retrying/). It comes in handy for dealing with things like unstable APIs 'n such (some internal systems here at work are hit or miss at times). It can be triggered with specific exceptions, and it has back-off timing (e.g., try 10 times, each time waiting 1 second longer than the last time). &amp;#x200B;
Try this: 'List.sort(key=lambda object: object.variable)'
Haha that was a good effort/honor ratio for me then! Good luck :)

I’m currently using codesignal.com to learn python. It’s very motivating because it’s centered around solving problems (ranging from very easy to harder) instead of reading a chapter on a specific topic and then solve related problems as is usually the case. Here you just get a problem/puzzle and then you need to solve to proceed to the next. There’s a large community so you can read people’s comments for each puzzle. I’ve learned A LOT in just 4 days already, I was totally new to python having only used R in the past. 
The Monty Python style should be the norm lol.
Which tool did you use to make the GUI?
triple quotes is not technically comments. It's a long multi-line strings. So it needs to confirm to the indent level of the code. Even when it's used as a docstring on a function/module it still needs to respect the indent level.
VSCODE GANG
Have you tried `multiprocessing` in your code? It works fine for so called "embarrassingly parallel" problems and is relatively easy to set up. The main limitation is that it uses python `pickle` so you cannot use classes (there is an external package called `dill` can deal with classes). I suggest giving multiprocessing a try before you look for other languages.
Just make sure forward compatible 3.3 core contexts are created on OS X making pyglet able to provide OpenGL contexts easy on all platforms. I guess you have to do that anyway becasue you go past 2.1 :) &amp;#x200B; It's the only thing that stops pyglet 1.3.x from being truely cross platform when it comes to context creation &gt; 2.1 so it's often dropped becaue of that alone.
wrap it in [code][/code] and it should keep the whitespace
Where can I find the code?
I did have a quick look at it, yeah. I agree it bears further investigation but at the moment I'm only running a simple randomForrest classifier. I'm not sure how parallel that can be (if at all). The only thing embarrassing is my inexperience here.
Congratulations!!!
In python comments are officially single line entries preceded by `#` which are ignored. Multiline strings/string literals unless used as docstrings (following a function or class definition) are ignored and generates no bytecode. So the effect is same as the comments. However unlike comments, string literals is still parsed by the interpreter and has to conform to indentation rules.
/r/learnpython
* nice
Spyder + VS Code
All jokes aside idk if its a feature or a bug i found. But when im tryn to learn my second spell i died in the middle of trying to draw it and it keeps the state of where on the grid ive drawn already instead of resetting my cast when i die. was a bit confusing to remember where i was at the in the cast and if i drew the wrong symbol idk how to stop casting it.
oh cool! where did you get the music/sound effects?
Tkinter!
Thank you!
It’s a secret 🤐
dataquest has been a blast for me!
perfect this looks like it will fit the bill
This was a new module introduced in 3.8.0 alpha 1 and it has docs in alpha 2 that will be improved. Thanks to Davin Potts for work on this. https://bugs.python.org/issue35813
Go see a Dr already. 😀
Welcome to the [80's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoxLYtfYvxs) kid. It's kinda fun to see this sort of thing get rediscovered by the next generation.
Made them with Bosca Ceoil and SFXR respectively.
Yeah, there aware a few death related bugs. I kinda ran out of time and wasn’t able to fix them.
Neat I didn't know someone made a Logo Turtle in Python.
[flake8](https://pypi.org/project/flake8/) \+ [radon](https://pypi.org/project/radon/) For convention checks/linting I use flake8 along with radon. Flake8 is one of the big linting libraries for python. Together with radon, providing a complexity check, you can discipline yourself to write better code. It truly helped me write more modular code and still pushes me to write cleaner code, sooner without optimizing prematurely. &amp;#x200B; [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) For unit testing, I use pytest. From simple tests, to monkey patching or full on mocking. I like that unittest is builtin to python, but I strongly prefer pytest. There are also add-on libraries on top of pytest for [coverage](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-cov/), [documentation](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-doc/), [profiling](https://pypi.org/project/prof/) and many more. I personally always use pytest with pytest-cov. It proves both the report of my tests, and which parts of my code still needs to be tested. For both professional and personal repositories, I use flake8, radon, pytest and pytest-cov in every single one of them. &amp;#x200B; [ipython](https://ipython.org/) Not really a library as in code wise something you will import, but man let me tell you about the best interactive python interpreter ever. It all started out with me not wanting to create scratch files in IDEs all the time to quickly run samples of code. I use it every single day, again both professionally and personally. It just is that go-to thing now for me I cannot detach myself from. &amp;#x200B; [virtualenv](https://pypi.org/project/virtualenv/) I once worked with an IT guy that shipped his own linux centos netboot image on every machine in the company. This is great for single point of definition package wise on the system (Not the best way to deploy images but that's a whole other story). But man. As developers we weren't allowed to install anything new. That sucked. Not with virtualenv. A "virtual" python interpreter where you can pip install whatever the hell you want (mostly, qt related libs still messy). Since virtualenv entered my life, python package management has been an almost flawless joy.
It reminds me of a Spirograph art piece. Very cool!
No. Indent each line with four spaces
\+1 Here. I like that they give examples which I can then make small changes to to test out my understanding then finish each page with a small reinforcement exercise. At the end of each "chapter" they have a larger project which helps tie everything together. I think it's helped me a lot. 
all good im still enjoying it. just thought i'd let you know!
like this: import turtle turtle.setup(800,800) while True: turtle.forward(64) turtle.left(56) turtle.back(34) turtle.backward(52) turtle.circle(63) 
Most numerics libraries in python are multi core. Even numpy is, out of the box. What are you using?
That's very tight butthole.
holy shit finally!! I've wanted this for sooo many years! I thought about proposing it to the devs, but never did because I figured they get that request all the time and have already decided against it for a whole bunch of good reasons that I have no idea about and that I would just be pissing them off. It really great to kno that that isn't the case and that people actually agree with me. Also I'm not sure why this has to be the walrus operator tho, whats wrong with just using `=` ? seems like it would be much easier onboarding people with just a single `=` because it has semantic compatability with C.
Define better. 
a little \[javascript\]([https://codepen.io/konijntjesbroek/pen/ajdbeL](https://codepen.io/konijntjesbroek/pen/ajdbeL)) version of the same thing
I like it. The haters will say python is already to easy dont go making it even more intuitive than it already is.
I suggest Linux as os or a native windows pYthon 
yes. The official docs at https://docs.python.org/3 are **by far** the best resource for learning python that exists. Start there. Its way, way better than any book, video, tutorial blog, or online MOOC course ive ever seen, and I've seen a lot. 
\#NVIMMASTERRACE
Thanks for the suggestion 👍
I don't know how it can be better so it's a rather open question. 😀
r/sacredgeometry 
you can use the `sqrt()` function from the `cmath` module instead of the one from the `math` module. The `cmath` one can handle neagive radicals and returns their complex values. The one from `math` just errors out.
Only difference I can think of off hand is multiprocessing... On Windows, mp spawns a whole new Python interpreter, so you have to work harder to transfer data to the child processes.
You should!

Wow... I haven’t seen BBcode in the wild in years. 
I am giddy at this release. Can't wait for __pypackages__ to be a thing forever.
Then Windows is never my answer. I don’t wanna get political but Linux is always better. There’s a reason most of the internet is run on Linux. 
Both work and are mature. Consider what you’re most comfortable with. Go with that.
This is a very Maya specific question and not really related to python other than it being the language you're using. I recommend asking future questions like this on Maya centric sites. Anyway to answer your question: Maya has a listRelatives command. You can use that with the allDescendants parameter to get all the children in a list. You can insert your current joint at the head of that list and then loop through the selection to get all the joints in the hierarchy.

I've just started Jose Portilla's "Complete Python Bootcamp" on Udemy. I want to learn Python for data science and change careers.
Is this at all based on logowriter? When I was a kid, there was a programming game at school that had us drawing with a turtle. Reminds me of that. 
Yup. I think I'm settling on 3.3 due to named Uniform Blocks.

Turtle graphics: Spirograph for programmers. :) Here's a little toy I wrote years ago (probably Python 2.x) import turtle t = turtle.Pen() turtle.speed('fastest') loop1=50 loop2=9 # Flower: a=125, b=85, loops are at 20 # Flower 2: a=45, b=23, loop1=23, loop2=13 # Star Wreath: a=135, b=70, loop1=50, loop2=9 a=65 b=23 for i in range (1,loop1): t.forward(a) t.left(b) for k in range(1, loop2): t.forward(b) t.right(a) 
One more thing, what exactly is "density"?
yea i see what you mean and how it could be discouraging others. before i posted it on this subreddit i went through a few of the top posts and realized how good all you on this subreddit were, i looked up to you. i felt like nobody would like my post because it was so basic. when i titled it as all my work i wasn’t trying to steal credit from the tutorial, or be dishonest. i don’t really know why i didn’t think about the aspect that it would be stealing from the tutorial, it just never went through my mind because i figured you guys were so much better than me at python
Nice. How do you export the resulting image in turtle?
/r/learnpython If you do `my_variable = plt.hist(whatever)`, then look at what `my_variable` is, you'll see that it's a tuple of 3 objects. Assigning a single tuple to a number of variables is called an unpacking assignment. See this example: point = (10, 20) x, y = point print(f"x = {x}") print(f"y = {y}") The three objects returned by `plt.hist` are described in the [matplotlib documentation](https://matplotlib.org/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.hist.html), which incidentally is the first search result for `matplotlib hist`. You only assign to `bins` once here (the named argument is something else) so style-wise it's fine.
This is for Lua yes? 
You might be able to literally ignore it and when you decide to start reading again run `flush` to clear away any input stored up. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26555070/linux-python-clear-input-buffer-before-raw-input &gt; termios.tcflush(fd, queue) Discard queued data on file descriptor fd. 
I wrote a java version of "turtle" years ago. I wrote functions to draw circles, squares, etc. which you could nest in loops and make all sorts of graphics like this. Look up harmonographs and try a few programmatically!!
RemindMe!
Because python doesn't have multiline comments. You've just written a string literal. There are special cases where a string literal in a particular place is assigned to an internal variable which can then be accessed as the docstring. That does not make it a comment. /r/learnpython
/r/learnpython Format your code properly. Read and apply PEP8. `FileNames` isn't what you think it is.
Learn to program in C++ if you want to produce .exe’s. That will likely irritate a few but the mark of a fine craftsman is his ability to pick up the right tool for the job at hand. 
This is amazing for things like AWS lambda, no more layer workarounds, no more weird packaging steps, who knows when AWS will actually adopt 3.8,but it's amazing anyways. It's one of the few things I prefer about the javascript ecosystem

Those terms are ridiculous 
I must be getting old because I wait for things to be released these days. The update is quick but actually using new features takes awhile. 
Cant even read it
Well done. Gui programming is hard: this is great stuff.
I appreciate the answer, mate. They are obviously used as multi-line comments, though. :—) 
I believe in you
You're saying `min` didn't do what you were expecting, but `max` did? How did you come to expect that, since they do the exact opposite?
Thank you. It is hard. I settled for this after having trouble making multiple pages / tabs etc. there’s so much more I wanted to do with it. Haha
The idea behind my `minimum` function would be that the first number would be set to the second number if it were lower than it. `max` takes the highest of 2 values, which is effectively the same. Kinda interesting how that type of function can be interpreted 2 different ways like that. xD
Yeah. I almost switched over to Love2D, but decided not to because Python as a language can be used for more stuff.
Looks like turtle can turn the canvas into Postscript, which PIL's Image module could read and convert. Haven't done any more than a basic Google search on this though.
cool, did you know that saving/ writing things in JSON is cool too?
You just need to move the cursor around. Move the (cli) cursor to the position in the cli where your table starts, then just print the new table.

I understood that to be for neural networks. Was something I was going to approach down the line. Is it worthwhile for more 'basic' classification models?

double-check that you have python installed, then open your cmd and write "py", that will open the python shell. There you can write python expressions and the shell will execute them, and write their outputs (ie. 5+2 will print 7 in the shell). If all this works, then exit the shell writing `exit()` and write instead `py your-program-file.py`. That should execute your program. Now, if you encounter any kind of error mensaje during this, copy it and paste into google and search for a page called StackOverflow. StackOverflow basically has every answer possible to any problem you might have.

Any other good tools besides Qt that are good? Though Qt seems to be the way to go GUI wise. Doesn't it add a shitload of bloat/dependencies? Just grasping at straws here.
It sounds good. Here are some of my thoughts. Maybe the third thing that comes to mind, but definitely the most important is: Aren't there similar solutions already? The first thing that came to mind is you should have defaults for object creation (or maybe configurable beforehand): from typenet.types import List, configure configure(nodes=['node01:4444', 'node02:4445'], partition_size=10000) li = List() li.append(0) ... This way you can deploy the module on the local infrastructure using configure() before doing the actual job. Another thought is, do you need separate methods for bulk operations? Usage-wise, why not simply extend a normal list then? Actions should mirror base type behaviour end to end, while the internal logic should decide which actual implementation to use.
 **@DaFluffyPotato** Great job! You also created all graphic layout ? Or you just download ready to use :D?
I'll bite. Googling around I didn't see what this is. What are you talking about?
COOL!! Logo was my first programming language in the 80's.

As always, trying to plot a damn chart
WSL is terrible, i recommend ubuntu as your base OS or if you have a decent enough computer just have an ubuntu Virtual machine open all the time for development.
Last resort, send it per mail, I assume you can get those. you might have to split it via archivers. 
I can help out in the 's' part at least (if my memory of seaborn is correct) - this is the point sizes. &amp;#x200B; I'm not entirely sure what the collections part is doing, but from looking at the above code, I'm assuming it's turning one of the plotted axis transparent?
Yep LOGO was the first programming language designed for education, I think. It was based on LISP and the main feature was turtle graphics. You could also get a physical turtle bot with a pen. 
I have also got a little spirograph script on my github. :) https://github.com/gamseb/spirograph Sadly it is broken so far, because I could not yet figure out how to calculate the lenth of the loop. :/ 
It's the [pep 582](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0582/) that make virtual envs obsolete. You essentially put your preferred packages inside your project under the `__pypackages__` directory and call it a day.
Not sure i understood what you meant, buin case i did.... Have you tried random.sample? https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html
 A = [1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0] # random mix of ones and zeros indices_of_ones = [i for (i, x) in enumerate(A) if x == 1] print(indices_of_ones ) # prints [0, 1, 3, 6, 7, 8, 10] indices_of_zeros = [i for (i, x) in enumerate(A) if x == 0] print(indices_of_ones ) # prints [2, 4, 5, 9, 11, 12] &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
I may be missing something, but isn't this what you want? results = await asyncio.gather(*coros)
You'd do better to post in /r/learnpython.
Not by anyone who knows how to program.
I am beginner at Python but you should look at the following libraries: - requests - BeautifulSoup - Selenium - Scrapy. 
How about this rework of the whole thing? You haven't included your tests, so I guess they'll be failing all over the place, but I think the functionality is preserved. [Less blunder, much Python](https://gist.github.com/ipopov13/0e3415d855053d82de35ffde734f5b86) The best way to learn how to do stuff more efficiently is by looking at examples :) You can study the differences between what you did and what I did and pick&amp;research the good bits for yourself. I'm not claiming maximum efficiency either, but I did my best to improve what you had started. What you can get from experience is way more than what you can get from tools. Study code, look at examples of solutions to the parts you feel can be better, search StackOverflow for those general problems too. It's a path you walk, continuously.
Really cool!! Thanks
If you're interested using python with qgis you can check this [link](https://www.geodose.com/p/pyqgis.html). There are some tutorials about python+qgis programming and other resources for learning.
line[0,index1] I think you mean `line[0:index1]` -- note the colon instead of a comma. With the comma, you are trying to index using a tuple. Also slicing defaults to 0 at the beginning, so you can use `line[:index1]` instead. 
Basically I am using a list to represent a pack of cards, and 0 means the card is present, and a one means the card is absent. I want to create a hand-generator that randomly selects cards that are numbered 0.
I appreciate the feedback, all good points/questions. I'll address some of these the next time I have time to update the code. On bulk append: I agree, but the issue is that a normal append can't detect if you're trying to append the list or each item individually, where the bulk version distinguishes that ambiguity. It can always be an optional parameter on the append method, but I'm not sure what's better. There probably is something similar that's been done before and please link it if you know of one.

It's so visually satisfying to look at! Question: who comes up with all these names? I'd like to be involved in the process , howabout twirlingmonkey for Python
You could just sample from all of them and repeat if you get a 1. That’s not really very efficient though, would be better if you were using a more appropriate structure, e.g. a set of the card values (e.g. 1-52) and just removed from the set.
How does that work with pip? Can you tell pip to install to pypackages folder?
The only thing annoying is when I have to declare something just to check it and use it right after. Can't wait to refactor my code with assignment expressions.
Sounds to me like the MicroPython project is sliding into dysfunctionality and becoming more concerned with being "nice" than getting shit done. Perhaps /u/ichbinsisyphos ought to check out [the fork](https://github.com/pfalcon/micropython) and see if it is any better maintained? Its quite rare for a fork to take over from the original project, but you never know unless you look.
Can someone explain the new features like I'm five.
nice, keep improving.
Ideally, yes. The PEP touches on it briefly: &gt; After doing a fresh check out the source code, a tool like pip can be used to install the required dependencies directly into this directory. But in the end, it's up to pip to search for that directory and install there if it's found. Maybe then if you want to install globally you would need to do something like `pip install package --global`
How come some of it is in sq ft and some is in number of tiles? (Not a criticism btw - I'm interested in the design thinking) Whats next for the tool?
Used to do this kind of shit on logo.
&gt; It just comes out with some message You definitely want to start in r/python. But a tip in general: Those messages are just random strings. They are huge clues about what's going on. Read that message and think about it. And at the very least, **report that when you report the problem**. Even if it means nothing to you, it will be a major sign of what's going on to an expert.
I mean, you can use list literals, or any other piece of syntax as comments if you want. Just don't be surprised when you have to obey syntax rules for them!
Im an estimator at a commercial flooring company. For my biggest account we order vct / lvt boxes for said job by the box (45 sf / box) and there are additional tiles in the stores vestibule which have to be counted individually (9”x9” and 18”x18”) then you have to order them by square footage instead of whole boxes. If that makes sense. And I honestly wanted to make two windows one for flooring and one for paint, but I’m gonna create another entire program dedicated to paint estimation instead because making separate windows for each is a bit ahead of my skill level. I started estimating in paint so I have a good knowledge of that as well. When that is finished I plan to send the software to my buddy who still estimates commercial paint jobs and let him and his company use it to make their work go more efficiently. 
 There are some solutions aiming to convert Python scripts into executable. I still doubt these solutions, avoiding them mostly. These solutions may fail; therefore, you should not rely on these solutions for serious projects. If you intend to publish executable, you should implement your program with compiled languages from day one. In My [python Training](http://pythonandmltrainingcourses.com/) they explain,There have been some compiled languages, like Go and Rust, easier than C/C++, providing enough performance, with mostly cross-platform code base. On the contrary, I only use these Python-to-exe solutions converting small-sized scripts for convenience
How does this relate to existing multiprocessing shared Array (an especially RawArray)? Also can you use this with ctypes.Structure?
How would this work for pre compiled binaries which are OS specific? 
Append is for adding individual items. Have you considered hooking into extend, instead, which adds all of the elements from a given list/iterable to the source list. It feels like that's the method you want, probably. 
Working on something similar for a bud of mine. Looks great. :D
Right, so you will need the "random" module. Start off with a list that has 52 zeros - because you start with all cards present. import random cards =[0]*52 # creates a list of 52 zeros Say now you want to draw 10 cards at random. You run the list comprehension line to get indices\_of\_zeros (i.e. get a list of all the cards that are still in the deck), and you select a random number from that list. This simulates drawing a card. Don't forget to mark that card in the "cards" list as having been drawn: drawn_cards = [] # empty list for i in range(10): cards_still_in_deck = [i for (i, x) in enumerate(cards) if x == 0] c = random.choice(cards_still_in_deck) # pick a random card from the ones in the deck drawn_cards.append(c) # add drawn card to list of all drawn cards cards[c] = 1 # mark chosen card as drawn It's worth noting that this is doing it the "hard' way because the numpy module has a version of the choice function, where you specify how many you want to draw and you can specify whether they're "replaced" (i.e. whether the same item in a list can be drawn more than once - in your case, no).

I don't know much about sklearn, but looking at the repo on github, it is mostly python and only depends on numpy and scipy. So I assume it is a pure numpy/scipy implementation of all of its stuff, and thus picks up the parallelism of those libraries. If you run numpy.show_config() you can see what numpy is linked against. In my case, that's intel MKL, which is a really high performance BLAS / numerics subsystem for x86 CPUs (particularly intel's own). Here you can see numpy chewing 6 cores (100% in MacOS is all of 1 core), https://i.imgur.com/4fCrKoM.jpg I could use 12 threads, but it would be slower. (In fact, for plus six threads is way slower than one). Plus is a single FLOP, so with 64-bit floats it's 8 bytes per cycle per core. At 3.6Ghz, that's 28.8GB/s of data. Desktop hardware with dual channel memory does anywhere from 20 - 40 GB/s (usually 40). So, with 6 threads I'm asking for ~175GB/s of memory, and the threads will compete for memory bandwidth and cause lots of cache misses. Sin and cos are about 4 FLOPS, and some special functions are more than ten, so you can scale up to 8 or more cores on most scientific code pretty well. And a 4-channel memory XEON/Threadripper/EPYC system has anywhere from 80 - 160GB/s of memory throughput, which helps support the high core counts. Anyway. You just need to know the pragma to control the number of threads your numeric subsystem behind numpy is using. MKL is MKL_NUM_THREADS, OpenMP is OPENMP_NUM_THREADS. OpenBLAS or ATLAS, I don't know.

Really depends on your programs. If you're a beginner creating simple application level programs you should see no essential difference. The difference would be where there are os specific system calls and advanced programs that interfaces with/depends on external C/C++ compiled codes.

I would argue the first - simply name the coroutine func "wrapper" and move along. Naturally wherever you run `asyncio.run` will block until it's completed. Would urge you to remember the caveats though: &gt; https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html#asyncio.gather &gt; ... &gt; If all awaitables are completed successfully, the result is an aggregate list of returned values. The order of result values corresponds to the order of awaitables in aws. &gt; If return_exceptions is False (default), the first raised exception is immediately propagated to the task that awaits on gather(). Other awaitables in the aws sequence won’t be cancelled and will continue to run. &gt; If return_exceptions is True, exceptions are treated the same as successful results, and aggregated in the result list.
&gt;&gt; I may be missing something ... &gt; ... for isolated asyncio code (e.g. **embedded in a larger, otherwise sync codebase**). You wouldn't be able to use `await` in a sync fn. 
Hmm. If it's just one directory with packages inside, it's indeed not the same, as venvs can be used for more, i.e. different testing environments, e.g. for different python versions. If there's just one, auto-detected package that only helps with a very limited subset of the problem, one that I usually don't even bother with, I go for something even simpler (#1): 1. global environment (good to test against the newest version of everything) 2. Project environment (good to test against the versions specified in your requirements with the newest python version) 3. Multiple environments (good to test all kinds of interpreters and package environments) 4. The same, but also with native libraries (issue prone, but it's what conda does) 5. Containers (good for testing against all kinds of different environments, including system packages, but unlike 4. in a guaranteed consistent state)

This is a great time to introduce you to [virtualenvs](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/). It's a _tiny_ bit of extra scaffolding, but it eliminates so many errors: - You won't get permissions errors anymore unless you go out of your way to get them - You can have multiple versions of the same package installed if you have projects that use different versions - You don't pollute the global package namespace - You can permanently bind a specific version of Python to a project - Your builds become more reproducible 
I think this is for the very common case of: 1. I want to download and install this useful project and have it be entirely self-contained so that I can `rm -rf project` afterward and have it gone.

Sure thing. It isn't necessary to know advanced Python to begin the product. You need to have good command of the fundamentals, especially operating and iterating through lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries. You also need to understand the basics of classes and object-oriented programming. Exposure to numpy will definitely help and seeing pandas in action will also be very useful.

Making an interactive curve fitter using scipy and matplotlib widgets.

I’m writing the popular card game Race for the Galaxy! I started over the weekend and so far have most of the game implemented and running, albeit without user interaction yet.

Major tasks left: add multiple players, add the rest of the cards, add user interaction. Eventually I’d like to write some Q learning AI for the game.

It’s because the single = is the source of countless subtle and hard to find/debug bugs in many C programs which is also why they didn’t allow for this previously with python. By using the walrus `:=` there’s very little risk of accidental assignments when wanting to do a equality check.

Also you could import random, and change colors while going through the loop Try this from random import randint as ri ... t.colormode(255) for i in range(10000): red = ri(0, 255) grn = ri(0, 255) blu = ri(0, 255) tur.pencolor(red, grn, blu) tur.goto(GOTO LINES HERE)
The density kwarg tells matplotlib how to normalize the plot. Density=True normalizes so that it is a probability density graph. Density=False makes it counts.

Your TOKEN will be displayed immediately after your bot's username is accepted. &amp;#x200B; Bellow you will find the code snippet you can use to send a notification. import requests def botSendMessage(botMessage): bot_token = 'TOKEN' # bot_chatID = 'CHAT_ID' send_text = 'https://api.telegram.org/bot' + bot_token + '/sendMessage?chat_id=' + bot_chatID + '&amp;parse_mode=Markdown&amp;text=' + botMessage requests.get(send_text) botSendMessage('Hey, this works!') &amp;#x200B;
Ah, that's unfortunate. Thanks for the answer!
As a side note, instead of artistData = json.loads(artist_info_from_LastFM.text) you can do artistData = artist_info_from_LastFM.json() 
Sounds fantastic - thank you. I need to become adept at Python very soon, so I will definitely try this course. 
r/learnpython is the better sub for questions like this.
:)
Hey again! I have brought more with me! The code is below. It is messy. Can't bother cleaning it. Here you go &amp;#x200B; import turtle as t import math as m import random as r tur = t.Turtle() scr = t.Screen() tur.speed(10) for a in range(120): tur.forward(2.5) tur.right(90-0.2*a) p = tur.pos() tur.forward(a*r.uniform(0.1,1.5)) tur.goto(p[0],p[1]) tur.left(90-0.18*a) tur.penup() tur.goto(0,0) tur.setheading(180) tur.pendown() for a in range(120): tur.forward(2.5) tur.left(90-0.2*a) p = tur.pos() tur.forward(a*r.uniform(0.1,1.5)) tur.goto(p[0],p[1]) tur.right(90-0.18*a) tur.penup() tur.goto(-40,90) tur.setheading(0) tur.pendown() for a in range(135): tur.goto(tur.pos()[0] + m.fabs(m.sin(a)),90 + 6*m.cos(a)) Have a nice day!
Correct. Hence the wrapping in an async def, corresponding to workaround 1)
Let us know how it goes !!

Thx for doing this :)
If you have enough data and time, you could use a Convolutional Neural Network. Or look for a pre-trained model and look how it performs

&gt; with other uses being 'deprecated but supported and frowned upon' Huh. I hadn't realised that. Is it written somewhere explicitly? I'm asking because I happen to have been reading the relevant PEPs lately and hadn't noticed this, though now that I look I see some evidence for that point of view... * [PEP 3107](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3107/) (2006, targetting 3.0) - which introduced function annotations - doesn't mention such deprecation (though I don't know if PEPs ever get retrospectively updated in such a way?)... * But by the time we get to [PEP 526](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0526/) (2016, targetting 3.6) - which introduces the syntax discussed in this post - that does indeed seem to only talk about "type annotations". And in the section on [_Other uses of annotations_](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0526/#other-uses-of-annotations), we have: &gt; These stored annotations might be used for other purposes, but with this PEP we explicitly recommend type hinting as the preferred use of annotations. I hadn't noticed that shift until now, and had it in my head that annotations were still widely envisaged as a general mechanism - albeit with type hints as the most common use case. I'm a little sad to discover that, I must say - though having done a lot of Haskell in the past I _am_ enjoying type hints.
reddit is a good IDE, right ?
Bookmarked it so I can come back once I have actually learned the basics. Thank you for your contribution!
I should have actually checked before I started rambling. You are already doing this right it seems: https://bitbucket.org/pyglet/pyglet/src/ea6080cbb3c0370124b30543757da8349f8ed3a3/pyglet/gl/cocoa.py?at=default&amp;fileviewer=file-view-default#cocoa.py-196:204

This is extremely important for data engineering specifically, because you will need to understand how to deploy code to production environments. This will help immensely with that.
For checking if a key exist in a dictionary and that the associated value is not None, which is faster/better: example_dict.get('key') is not None or 'key' in example_dict and example_dict['key'] is not None
this is great for very simple excels but I wish sorting and row addition /deletion were taken into account 
to do this you need some kind of unique id like the primary key in a database table. then if you consider excel 1 and 2, any primary key which is in 2 but not in 1 is new, anything in 1 which is not in 2 had been deleted, anything which is in both 1 and 2 should be compared for changes like in this blog.

From a GIS Analyst perspective, you should look into the Network Analyst features that will automatically create a shortest path based on your constraints. If you want a purely free option check out QGIS and there should be supporting python documentation. This is just my thought process going about solving your problem, maybe not the most python intensive solution. 
Take a look at [PRAW - the Python Reddit API Wrapper](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). I've had some luck with it in the past, and it gives you relatively straightforward access to a bunch of that information. You could format the data however you want, then save to a .csv file, which is readable by Sheets. Another alternative that I haven't tried is using Pandas "read\_html", which returns a Pandas Dataframe created from elements on the website you pass to it. I have no idea whether it would work for your use case, but it's a quick and dirty method for getting tabular data off websites. 
Why not a for loop doing same actions in all monitors? That way you would avoid repeating so many similar commands. Something like: `for monitor in monitors:` `do_something` &amp;#x200B;
No.
Lol no
Turtle twiddling is about to go meta
No, You can still install it free from a google search so it shouldn’t make much difference 
Be careful forwarding emails from your company email to some other email service. This is most likely against your company's IT policy. 
Microsoft does not support an environment like Java or Python, but supports its own crap like the .NET Framework :).
Not really a comment relating to your post (sue me), but its funny how you didn't say y'all. When someone says "y'all" its considered stupid, yet if they say peoples its considered literate, while y'all has been a used contraption for over a century, but peoples has been considered incorrect grammar until very recently, and by many still is. And if you don't think y'all is an actual contraption, why not? People just took it is and made it's, why oppose "y'all" more than the equally made up "can't"?
Memory usage is far more complicated than that. Just because your memory usage goes up over time does not mean you have a leak. Assuming it's pure python code, the most likely reason is that you have internal references to data. Python cleans up the things that reach a reference count of 0 immediately/near immediately. When things are deleted, but references still exist, they get put into on of 3 categories based on how many times they have failed to be cleaned up. The ones that take more tries to clean up end up living live longer. The objgraph module is great for diagnosing those issues.
This is not the right tool for his use case.... &amp;#x200B; That's not a problem with the tool, it's a problem with the engineer.
 import os, random def randomize_wallpapers(number_of_wallpapers): path_to_wallpapers = "/path/drive/Data0/Pictures/Wallpapers/Linux Computer/Touch Terminal-like/" wallpaper_files = os.listdir(path_to_wallpapers) random_wallpapers = random.sample(wallpaper_files, number_of_wallpapers) return [f'"{os.path.join(path_to_wallpapers, wallpaper_file)}"' for wallpaper_file in random_wallpapers] def set_wallpapers(monitors, wallpapers): counter = 0 for monitor in monitors: os.system(f'xfconf-query -c xfce4-desktop -p /backdrop/screen0/{monitor}/workspace0/last-image --set {wallpapers[counter]}') counter += 1 return True monitors = ["monitor0", "monitor1", "monitor2"] set_wallpapers(monitors, randomize_wallpapers(len(monitors))) You could do something like this. Mind you I just wrote this up in the comment box at 1 AM and haven't actually tested the code. The first function takes in the amount of wallpapers to generate and return a list containing the full path to the wallpapers. Lookup f-strings and list comprehension if the spaghetti return-statement doesn't make sense to you. The double-quotes are added in this step. The second function sets the wallpaper for each monitor. It takes in the name of the monitors as a list and loops through them, setting the wallpaper to the wallpaper at the position of the counter variable in the "wallpapers" list that is passed in along with the monitors. Again using f-strings to format the strings. We also return True, just to return something that isn't None.
Yeah when I get home, I'll try this out. Things like list comprehension and f-strings are definitely new to me, since C doesn't really have things like that. Got a lot of reading to do I suppose.

I haven't tested it, but give [gist](https://gist.github.com/Aareon/7961ba051c42d9ef96b3efd4329b9201). It's a quick improvement on I made to your script. On mobile. Oof. 
[User Posts - Reddit PRAW Documentation]( https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/code_overview/models/redditor.html?highlight=user#praw.models.Redditor.submissions) Getting the PRAW Reddit API is rather straight-forward. I would recommend watching [Sentdex's PRAW tutorial series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRgfgtzIhBQ&amp;list=PLQVvvaa0QuDcg7v9OIyT-DWXX4WOjmJ9I) if you aren't too familiar with PRAW. As /u/JabrZer0 said, you could write the post data into a .csv file [(csv module tuorial here)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5uM4VKywbA).
This should be pretty straightforward using [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org). 
You could also do this to make a rainbow on a dark background: import turtle from math import sin, cos, radians as rad from colorsys import hls_to_rgb t = turtle.Turtle() s = turtle.Screen() turtle.colormode(255) turtle.bgcolor('#202020') t.speed(0) t.width(2) low = 125 mid = low * 2 high = mid * 2 t.up() t.goto(low * sin(rad(0)), mid * cos(rad(0))) t.down() for i in range(360): t.pencolor(*map(lambda x: round(x * 255), hls_to_rgb(i / 120, 0.5, 0.5))) t.goto(low * sin(rad(i)), mid * cos(rad(i))) t.goto(mid * sin(rad(i)), high * cos(rad(i))) t.goto(high * sin(rad(i)), low * cos(rad(i))) s.exitonclick() [Result](https://www.dropbox.com/s/aowj17jctseroxc/Screenshot%202019-02-26%2016.20.44.png?dl=0)

Windows 10 does not come with Python pre-installed, but it *can* be installed either via the Python website, or via the Microsoft Store.
How did you record it?
I think you meant 'contraction'.
You really don’t even need Python to do what you’re asking — you can pretty easily do all of that directly in Excel.
Very nice! This will definitely make a lot of things easier. The whole ordeal with transferring data from and to processes is really cumbersome right now.

TIL drawing a vagina in Python is cool.
I would put the computer away, grab paper and a pencil and study some algorithms until you understand them... then try to implement them in python. There is an ocean of algorithms out there to learn. Start with the basic ones. This way you learn programming and not python specifically. It's time well spent that will help you becoming a good programmer and not only a python programmer.
Integrating celery into some of my apps - possibly tying in WebSockets for updating results rather than jQuery polling very X seconds.
Is the scripting so complex it can't be done in bash? I would also abandon PowerShell. It's not like you didn't learn anything from using it at least. Start fresh and enjoy the ride.
You should be able to click it, otherwise go to your project preferences and type in interpreter in the search. This will take you to the section where you can tell it which interpreter to use
Which should I use I have no experience coding 
I'd recommend installing the latest version of Python for your system (3.7). Once it's installed, Pycharm should be able to see it. Also you might want to ask these kind of questions in /r/LearnPython . 
Yeah I know sorry. Where do I download this and what environment should I use and I have no interpreter
Alright had to install Python 3.7 to get it to work, MX Linux has Python 3.5.3 installed normally. It was complaining about the use of f-strings as wrong syntax, which from reading about it, was added in Python 3.6. So from what I understand, the f-string is just a replacement for the older more C-style string formatting with the % symbol? Which when combined with list comprehension turns what would be several lines of code into one line? That's actually kind of cool, though I'm not 100% sure how I feel about list comprehension in general. I get that it's reducing the number of lines of code, but to me it's harder to follow logically. Thanks for the help, I tested the update you did and it works just fine after installing Python 3.7 and calling /usr/bin/python3.7 in the shebang line.
I've never tried disabling the garbage collector. I'm making up numbers, but close enough. What I was seeing was a graph that would "leak" by say 20 MB each step. At step 10, it would drop by 100 MB, so higher than step 0, but slightly improved. Then it would climb again for 10 steps and drop again. After roughly 40 cycles of that (so a total of ~400 or so duplicate operations), it would drop down to step 1 or so. Then it would repeat. That was not a memory leak. One of the problems I ran into was I created a dictionary of functions as a class variable. It's fine for the code, but that specific data becomes totally useless once you finish the main call (it was done to optimized some file parsing). So you could use a context manager, or you could just delete it at the end. The class is useless if you don't read a file, so it would "leak" if you just instantiate and delete it, but mehh. There might still be a couple internal references, but I got the majority out of it just by deleting useless data at the end and using objgraph to see what else there was. What was actually really interesting was that explicitly deleting more internal objects didn't always improve memory usage. It got binned into a different cleanup category.
Go to the python website to download the newest version of python.
after downloading it its on my winrar files what do I do now?
Try going back to pycharm and go from there. If you need anything else just ask.
ok and sorry for the questions what I click in pycharm no options to instert it or waht I str8 up dont know shit about this
Is there a TLDR on the differences in opinion? I don't really care about all the drama but are there differences in ideas about the direction and future of the project? Imo, it would be ludacris to remove someone who (by his own claim) contributed ~40% of the project over online "conduct", which is what it seems like from the few posts linked above. 
Gimme a minute and I'll get right back to you
I'm working on a release that supports multiple versions of Python and, golly, I'll be glad when 3.4 and 2.7 are officially dead.
With all due respect, if you want to learn to code, you also need to learn to search for answers on Google or similar sites. A quick Google search would have shown you how to download Python from the Python site, and also how to configure the Python interpreter in PyCharm. https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/project-interpreter.html Please try putting in a little effort here first because you'll need to figure a lot of this out for yourself.
Ok thanks for letting me know
I've been having fun with micropython You should be enquiring here [https://forum.micropython.org/](https://forum.micropython.org/) There is new build 1.10 from January 2019 [https://forum.micropython.org/viewtopic.php?f=8&amp;t=5868](https://forum.micropython.org/viewtopic.php?f=8&amp;t=5868) 
Nice work, and a really well set out readme!
You have to look at each each board. My own experience with Aduinos made me assume I may have some work to do if I change boards. There are a lot of controllers running microPython. A quick look in Canada an I see [https://www.robotshop.com/ca/en/micropython-pyboard-lite-v10-accelerometer.html](https://www.robotshop.com/ca/en/micropython-pyboard-lite-v10-accelerometer.html) That said it seems Adafuit made CircuitPython because want some control on the interpreter that they will ship with their controller. The want more uniformity across their boards. [https://learn.adafruit.com/welcome-to-circuitpython/featured\_products](https://learn.adafruit.com/welcome-to-circuitpython/featured_products) [https://learn.adafruit.com/welcome-to-circuitpython/featured\_products](https://learn.adafruit.com/welcome-to-circuitpython/featured_products) &amp;#x200B;
Automated daily reporting for an AB test we've got running. It's nothing special - I've created a script that outputs summary statistics to an Excel workbook. Next step is to write the output to an email rather than an Excel workbook. I've also built a dashboard for trend analysis of the data that uses plotly and ipython widgets. I'll probably keep adding functionality to that. At some point I might switch over to dash rather than ipython widgets.
If you are just starting out you might be better off with a text editor rather than a full IDE like PyCharm. Sublime Text, Notepad++, TextEditor will work fine if you are just learning the basics and writing simple scripts, and they will continue to work well for more complex projects. 
Reddit is being stupid and not letting me separate these properly, the syntax is correct on my computer just not here. 
Thank you! :-)

That’s dope

What environment do you use for Python? I am planning to learn Turtle with my 7 year old daughter.

For this I used the default python IDE. To be honest turtle is really basic and anything such as atom or even the default ide should work just fine
Too lazy xD
I searched google for a GIF recorder and used the first link. Nothing really special 
Hey DFP! I forgot to check and ask how many copies of superpotato you sold so far? You are becoming (or already are) a bit of an inspiration for me with pygame. And python. :D
*sigh* 
That does sound easy and I love that there's advice for every language! Thanks!
You can initialize the list in the beginning and then use the list.append(value) to add things to the end of a list
👍🏼 Thank you
You're most likely trying to install this package from a non-administrative shell.
Put four spaces at the start of a new paragraph and Reddit will treat it as code.
Do not use an IDE. It will hide things from you an do things without being asked, which will confuse the crap out of you as a beginner. With time, you will feel the need some features that can be found on an IDE. When that time comes, install VS Code and download modules as you fell like you need them. Always improve your environment gradually , that's the only way to know what you like and what you dislike. Always do things without external libraries first, not allowing things to be hidden from you is the only way of truly learning a programming language. After you understand, you can hide and/or automate. &amp;#x200B;
Without knowing the problem you are trying to solve, perhaps this suggestion will not be valuable. Why do you want to ** store ** random numbers rather than just generate them and use them right away. Random numbers are rarely (ever?) reused. Therefore, look up the generator syntax.
Make a card class and instantiate it with the values (number, card type). Your card class will have a outline of a card and dynamically populated values by passing the values when instantiating the object.
PLEASE HELP! I'm trying to create a simple python program that uses at least two loops and validates user input. I have only made the most rudimentary programs so far so I'm a little lost on where to start. My idea was to make a program that asked the user "Are you ready to generate a number? Hopefully it's lucky!", if they enter Y, y, N, or n then it would generate a random number, then if that number was above a random threshold it would be considered "lucky" or if under the threshold it would be considered "unlucky" Any help at all would be greatly appreciated, two jobs and full time school has me a bit behind :\\

No legacy features will be used in the pyglet core, so things should be able to be pretty flexible. If you are interested in helping out with this work, stop by our Discord: [https://discord.gg/QXyegWe](https://discord.gg/QXyegWe) 
You remember me when I made similar things with an Olivetti pc128... Good times :) 
Also r/learnpython
One thing you might need to do is disable the "shadow_window" for OSX. OSX doesn't have the ability to upgrade a context, so it will fail if this shadow window context exists. 
LOL
344 copies at full price or more and $2,000 in gross profits. 100 hours of work went into it, so I made about $20/hr.
thanks, I will try this out &amp;#x200B;
Thanks so much for your effort here-- it has certainly not gone to waste. I've spend a good part of my day reviewing your approach. It seems much tighter and cleaner! There are a number of areas in your changes I'm a bit confused about, but this has given me a great starting point to learn about. Are there other resources or forums like this to bounce code like this off of? Thanks again :D
A year ago, I read that I had to use a different virtualenv for Windows. That might have been very old news that still surfaced on Windows. I suppose that might be solved now since I can Python -m venv I also couldn't compile my mod_wsgi (via a package I can't recall installed using pip) on Windows but worked fine on real Ubuntu (not Windows subsystem) That wasn't too important then as I could just `manage.py runserver` in Windows. But this time round, I did get scrapy to install/compile. Is that a sign of Python for Windows maturing or are there other issues I should consider?
Don't know. Haven't used them, just know of them.
You can probably find a ton of Python communities out there. The most active I know of is the aforementioned StackOverflow. You can also use /r/learnpython, as u/rzzzwilson noted.
But only if it is a onetime thing. If you have to do it everyday you might be saving some time using python.
No experiences with that library.
What editor should I use? Pycharm, Idle or VSC?

Continuing some Udemy python courses (had studied via lectures and textbooks for about 3 months prior, but wanted to take courses to see how much I exactly know and where to improve as I did not stick with college and decided to dedicate that time to study) along with that I am trying to find some sort of mentorship whether that be an unpaid internship or 1:1 classes or something as I still feel lost not knowing what exactly I will be doing if I do one day get hired as a software developer.

Good use of enumerate. I always forget about it and ending up using counter variables instead. 
Me?
Once you get used to the syntax of list comprehension you'll use it all the time. Instead of doing this: list = \[\] for number in things: 
&amp;#x200B; |Title|Type|Billing ID|\#DSTBs|Views|Avg FF|Avg Rew|Avg Pau|ID| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |Name1|SD||2|2|0.5|0.5|\-|12345| |Name2|HD||6|13|\-|0.3846153846|0.3846153846|23456| |Name2|SD||21|28|1.428571429 |0.3928571429|0.5|23456| |Name2|HD||8|11|0.5454545455 |0.4545454545|0.6363636364|23456| |Name3-1|SD||4|5|2.8|\-| 0.6 |34567| |Name3-2|HD||4|6|0.8333333333 |0.1666666667|0.1666666667|34567| |Name4|HD||3|5|0.2|\-|\-|45678| As you can see, I need to add #DSTBs, Views, Avg FF, Avg Rew, Avg Pau. I want to sort by IDs, although Titles and Type differ even though IDs are the same ... Will groupby and sum work?

Any you feel comfortable with. I used Sublime, now VSC. I've tried pycharm, but it's too much for my use. Idle is super basic, but it's clearly possible to do great stuff in Idle too, just look at what /u/DaFluffyPotato does with it: https://cmlsc.itch.io/
Thanks so much! I currently use Pycharm and enjoy the debugging features it gives me but I always prefer lightweight editors which is what I like about Atom. Unfortunately, Atom probably requires a lot of plugins to support Python, eh?
Nope. Just carrying on with the thread :)
Oh I was concerned I broke a rule lol. Sorry for the confusion. 
This is great news for me, I've always hated the python dev workflow because of that horrible hack that are virtual envs. I wish they also removed the venv feature from the official CPython distribution, but I don't think they will go that far. &amp;#x200B;
This is definitely r/pythonporn material
Nice job! ;) To avoid recording ans editing video, you can make an image after each cycle and then glue the images together in a gif (via ImageMagick as example): ts = turtle.getscreen() # some code... turtle.hideturtle() # make the turtle invisible ts.getcanvas().postscript(file='my_image'+str(IMAGE_NUMBER)+'.eps') # save vector image turtle.showturtle()
Ah cool. I never thought about that. I'm a Python/Django beginner.
I do run Ubuntu on a VPS but mostly doing php stuff, using Python only for sysadmin stuff. Now I'm starting to develop in Python/Django and learning about this ecosystem. You're right though I have way less issues with the setup in Ubuntu on my VPS.
Don't use pycharm if you didn't start coding yet. Use the IDE that comes with python and focus on the code itself. Using pycharm for your first approach to programming is going to make things unnecessarily harder.
well, you should be able to make it work according to your requirements (sorry for the image, I'm in a rush) &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
Personally I've only used Atom for a little bit of web development, and felt that it wasn't very lightweight at all. This was 3 or 4 years ago though, so things might have changed. For VSC you pretty much only need the base software + the Python plugin. Get the Atom One Dark Theme extention too, to get the sexy Atom look :)
I wrote something like the script you are looking for for aggregation of around 100 Excel files few times a week with some additional logic included. For most cases simple `xlrd` and `xlsxwriter` libraries should be enough for your application. 
Go with the buzzwords. Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Cloud. Showcase/Demonstrate how almost every company uses Python in these areas. Available on every platform. Showcase some aesthetic visualizations made using matplotlib or any other library. How easy it is use as in the case of "Jupyter Notebook". How easy it is to embed data visualizations from analytical tools such as PowerBI, Tableau or Matlab as well. Compare a simple program code in C++,Java etc. with Python connoting ease to code and all.
So now my code looks like this: `import pandas as pd` `import sys` &amp;#x200B; `inFile = open(sys.argv[1], encoding='utf-8')` `df = pd.read_csv(inFile, header=0)` `df.groupby('Title').sum()` `df.groupby('SAM ID').sum()` `print(df)` &amp;#x200B; But it doesn't work ... It doesn't throw any errors, but in the end the output date is exatly the same as input. &amp;#x200B;
Eeeu you are wrong microsoft does support python as you have support for it in visual studio ide. And can install in visual studio bundle or microsoft store.
&gt; Is there a TLDR on the differences in opinion? I haven't seen any details anywhere. TBH I'm surprised its possible for the developers to "disagree deeply on direction" - I'd have thought "a Python implementation for microcontrollers" would be a well-defined goal?
