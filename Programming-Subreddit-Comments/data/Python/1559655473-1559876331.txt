Hi there, from the /r/Python mods. We have removed this post as it is not suited to the /r/Python subreddit proper, however it should be very appropriate for our sister subreddit /r/LearnPython or for the r/Python discord: https://discord.gg/3Abzge7. The reason for the removal is that /r/Python is dedicated to discussion of Python news, projects, uses and debates. It is not designed to act as Q&amp;A or FAQ board. The regular community is not a fan of "how do I..." questions, so you will not get the best responses over here. On /r/LearnPython the community and the r/Python discord are actively expecting questions and are looking to help. You can expect far more understanding, encouraging and insightful responses over there. **No matter what level of question you have, if you are looking for help with Python, you should get good answers**. Make sure to check out the rules for both places. Warm regards, and best of luck with your Pythoneering!
I’m using selenium with python to write a test cases for a web app
Great job bruh, its amazing work. Thanks for sharing!!!
Dude this is so cool
I am proud of you..and I don’t even know you
Yeah, you're right. I fell for the "it passed the provided test cases" syndrome.
Yeah, I can see that. Looks like I need to write a better description 😂
For science, what would happen if you show it a puzzle that a. is incorrect (two of the same number in one line, etc.) b. one that is empty enough to have several solutions?
This is amazing
Not gonna lie i was expecting something completely different by your title... was thinking of https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_RPG and how you were gonna use python with it to do something
**IBM RPG** RPG is a high-level programming language (HLL) for business applications. RPG is an IBM proprietary programming language and its later versions are available only on IBM i- or OS/400-based systems.It has a long history, having been developed by IBM in 1959 as the Report Program Generator — a tool to replicate punched card processing on the IBM 1401 — then updated to RPG II for the IBM System/3 in the late 1960s, and since evolved into an HLL equivalent to COBOL and PL/I. It remains a popular programming language on the IBM i operating system, which runs on IBM Power platform hardware. The current version, RPG IV, a.k.a. ILE RPG, provides a modern programming environment. *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Python/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28

Stanley won't be too happy about this.
PyCharm is great. The Community edition is free.
I've found [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to be the best lightweight IDE to work with, many people also like Atom but VSC does it for me. &amp;#x200B; Setup Guide for Python. [https://realpython.com/python-development-visual-studio-code/](https://realpython.com/python-development-visual-studio-code/)
Geany, PyCharm CE. [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/?fromMenu) does not require a install, at least not on Linux, so try it out. It has an integrated debugger, is extensible etc.
If you are larning python for data sience, i recomend spyder, is very god
It was so I could call its \_\_init\_\_ method once at the beginning of the code (to load the model) and then keep using that same instance to predict the numbers. It seemed pretty clean to me, but im sure there's a better way.
Very cool / you can make a augmanted re.... To a chest match .
This is cool. Good work.
I didn't come up with the actual algorithm to solve the sudoku (I tried, but my algorithms were too slow lol) but it does this: a. it doesn't show any numbers, just stays blank. b. actually one or two of these sudokus have multiple solutions and it just picks the first one it finds.
Kite has proven itself a scummy, dishonest operation. I would avoid at all costs. There's at least one representative who continues to post on reddit. That user will post links to Kite blog posts, but those links aren't direct URLs to Kite's website. Instead the user will post URLs to a tracking service which then redirects the user to the Kite blog post. So, yes, Kite continues to be awful.

Thank you! I'm about to graduate with an unrelated degree so I hope I can get a decent programming job with stuff like this
We live in the future, guys.
I just started learning the basics. Anyone have any project ideas? I want to make a comparison website that compares prices of a product across different websites, but not sure how I might go about doing this. Anyone have any advice?
You should keep working hard studying programming and stuff like that dude. You are good at it. There is a lot of opportunities. You have good analytical skills, maybe you can do a lot of jobs that require problem solving, for example handyman, they pay good. Good luck!
Basic tutorials, advanced tutorials, Documents for various modules(Pygame, random. Stuff like that)
Would be great to have a place that has everything.
I'm confused. Why isn't the solution to just use the native library function `str.isdigit()`? &gt;Return true if all characters in the string are digits and there is at least one character, false otherwise. [^source](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.isdigit)
This cool (especially the AR aspect) but why in the world would you use a neural net for sudoku? Just write an actual solver algorithm and it'll be much faster and 100% accurate, no models required...
How so? You wrote qt apps? I use qtpy as a layer between pyqt4, pyqt5, pyside, and pyside2 so I write once and run on any of them. I don’t know any of them, yet I know all of them.
1. /r/learnpython 2. Look into `str.split` to break your string into lines, and then a `for` loop to find the line you want.
thanks, I'll look into it
That's pretty awesome.
In future, please post to /r/learnpython. This sub is more for discussion and news about Python, not beginner questions.
Long ago, I wrote a wrapper to matplotlib because matplotlib was hard. A year later, I got so angry at the package because it didn’t support something simple that I just deleted it and replaced it throughout all the company software. A similar thing happened when my coworker wrote an interface to vtk, which is a 3D renderer. It copied things all over the place and was hard to sift through it’s various flags. I wrote a new 3D GUI and decided to not do anything that code did. Each format had to manage their data themselves and create the objects themselves. You learn vtk and it’s clear when you come back to it. If the interface is thin, it’s fine. As long as you have your fine control if you want it, there’s not a problem.
I think a good start would be to check the websites you’re wanting to compare prices of, for an API. If they have one, awesome, learn how to interact with it. If not, you can try the harder route of scraping the information off the website 😬
Can't think of a simpler solution than is_anagram = lambda a, b: sorted(a) == sorted(b)
Yeah, I missed the part about not using built in libraries. Guess I didn't get the job as dev, but I would have gotten the job as the PM since I broke the rules to save time and money.
Hmmm perhaps you have a different version of cv2? Try removing the parentheses around the screen sizes so that they’re not a tuple/“list” object and are just two separate ints.
Wow... it\`s amazing =) Good job
I can relate to your sentiment brother. But I believe basic problems like these are a good way to gauge problem-solving skills. I have seen people failing the standard Fizzbuzz problem so many times. On the other hand, such problems have multiple approaches to solving them, which eliminates the kind of candidate filters their way through by memorize the solution. You will not be asked to invert a binary tree on the job, will you? https://twitter.com/mxcl/status/608682016205344768 &amp;#x200B; Also you are most welcome to contribute to this repo. Feel free to add more problems which you seems are fun. Language is no barrier. Peace
Yeah don't do that.
It's designed as a POC for fun and games, clearly not to be used in production.
Just don't do that.
I agree with your point @vswr, it differs from case to case. "Reinventing the wheel" is a loss of time and money but I am not trying to make another collection of "Python tips and tricks". The idea is to enforce logical thinking and problem solving. Python is a verbose language in my opinion and henceforth been used here. Using the rich built in functions and library definitely saves your time, but from an interviewing perspective: you kind of lose your edge.
This might sound dumb, but What is an API? I’ve heard of it but don’t understand it. Thx
I totally agree. Demonstrating how to solve a problem without helpers shows basic knowledge of the lingo and gives clues about how a person approaches a problem.
Given that it's just a proof of concept package to show how `setup.py` is just some code that you can run, adding to the fact that you can safely install in a virtual environment, I fail to see what is the problem here?
Application programming interface. Essentially it’s something that software vendors - or websites - develop to make it easier for people to retrieve data, or a way of allowing people to programmatically do things. There are a load of better definitions out there, but hopefully that makes sense at a high level.
1.) Pointless 2.) Helps nobody. 3.) Not everything is done in a virtual environment. 4.) Promotes stupidity.
First of all, great job! Also, if you do not mind asking, what degree do you graduate and was your graduate degree still intervened with learning python, or is that something you did as a completely seperate thing? Also, \~ how many years of experience with python? Thanks in advance!
“The” most popular or “some”. These numbers do not seem like they even scratch the surface of being **the** most popular
Try /r/LearnPython
I figure it out, thanks for the tip.
line 39, in &lt;module&gt; reduced = cv2.resize(gray, int(screen\_width), int(screen\_height)) TypeError: int() argument must be a string, a bytes-like object or a number, not 'builtin\_function\_or\_method' \^ I tried many methods of fixing this, maybe it's because of the "os.popen" that's the problem. Btw I am using cv2 version 4.1.0
Fair enough. I did some filtering here, excluded big company stuff/popular papers, as well as courses. PySnooper indeed is the most starred one started in 2019 - but there are plenty others I might have filtered out by mistake.
Digit recognition is cool. Drawing the letters to fit the distance and rotation is awesome. But what's most exciting to see is the constraint propagation. Classic AI algorithms like that are way under appreciated. Nice job combining so many different problems into a succinct package!
When I print(screen\_width,screen\_height), it just came out as \[\] \[\], is that suppose to happen?
wait, what's wrong with kite exactly? i use it in Atom and i didn't know it was bad..
Thank you for adding wav files.
Working on a beer rating predictor. I rated a different beer everyday last year and am using the data to make visualizations and the predictor.

This is amazing
That is so sick! Congrats!
It's a degree in Translation (so pure Humanities, nothing to do with computers) and I started with Python a few months ago (I think I started doing Harvard's online course CS50 on March 1st). However I had done quite a bit of programming when i was around 10-13 on Game Maker and I already had a good understanding of the basics. Also I know maybe this project looks pretty advanced, but once I got good at image processing and could consistently extract the sudoku image with readable numbers (the hardest part), it was just a matter of passing the numbers to a neural network and solving the sudoku. It does look very cool but if you split it into small problems it's very doable.
Since this problem is discussed so much, I have added another implementation which also checks for float, binary, octal and hex numbers. Tried to include all possible test cases. Feedback will be much appreciated. [https://github.com/devAmoghS/Python-Interview-Problems-for-Practice/blob/master/is\_numeric.py](https://github.com/devAmoghS/Python-Interview-Problems-for-Practice/blob/master/is_numeric.py)
Why is the name songoku? :)
I think it was my grandad who used to call sudokus songokus (based on dragon ball) and i mean its a pretty good pun
PyCharm Community Edition is free and does all that.
Is the professional version something I should consider? or is the community edition good enough?
I saw the yearly pricing and noped the duck out of there without even checking what it offers lol Checking the site it lists the pro version as having extra support for: scientific tools, web dev, python web frameworks, python profiler, remote development, and database/SQL support. I do web development and have had no issues without the pro version. Maybe I'm missing out on some cool stuff, who knows lol
Kind of just want to sell it for a few hundred bucks. Don’t want to keep up the maintenance with a site like that.
Definitely not. You could change the assignment of those two variables to be a fixed number instead. It seems to be a problem with the os function detecting your screen size I guess.
[removed]
Dude, put this on regular glasse, impress everyone in the subway
Interesting list, thanks.
If the project helps the person that makes it learn the language, then it is neither "pointless" nor "helping nobody". Not everything needs to be useful to others in order to be worth creating. This argument is like saying that school programming assignments are useless because they're not "useful" outside of that context.
How is it racist??
You can also use any text editor and then run the program using the console.
okay cool thank you! does it run my scripts internally or do I put them into terminal ?
I'm at work, so unable to comment in more detail, but here are a few links from around when the log was turned over: - [How a VC-funded company is undermining the open-source community](https://theoutline.com/post/1953/how-a-vc-funded-company-is-undermining-the-open-source-community) - [Kite injected telemetry into the third most popular Sublime package](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/6qwtfz/kite_injected_telemetry_into_the_third_most/dl0psv0/) - [Specify the current project owner and relations with Kite](https://github.com/autocomplete-python/autocomplete-python/issues/308) - [Minimap plugin for Atom implements ads, refuses to revert, resulting in a fork](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/6nugeh/minimap_plugin_for_atom_implements_ads_refuses_to/dkczjmt/)
Yah I read about this too, then I just put my script files in terminal and run them right?
It has a console built in.
I’m going to be making a self help tool. For my friends kid for his new laptop. Just a easy to use tool to help him diagnose/resolve a problem as easily as possible.
You are boring, I bet you grew up without climbing trees or tobogganing and without making anything explode.
This why we need types lol
No problem! I also made an audio converter than allows you to convert an audio file to a different format (such as WAV).
There are probably a couple of dozen ways you could develop on the Mac. Suggestions: 1. Eclipse with PyDev installed. PyDev is great, Eclipse though sucks. The suck comes from it (Eclipse) eventually borking itself. If you are careful with Eclipse though PyDev is very impressive. 2. Yes XCode can be used for Python development! It isn’t optimal by any means though. If you expect to be programming in any language I highly recommend installing XCode as it adds a lot of developer tooling to the Mac. 3. Python itself comes with an editor called Idle. It actually isn’t that bad for a beginner. 4. There are a number of text editors like VIM that run on the Mac. Text editors and the command line are the traditional approaches to Python development. There are likely dozens of text editors out there with VIM being just one example. 5. There are versions of EMACS available for the Mac. EMACS is often described as a cross between a text editor and a modern IDE. The learning curve is huge but you can get started quickly. 6. There are a lot of GUI based IDE’s out there some available on Homebrew if I remember correctly. I don’t have time to extend the list but there are at least a half dozen more both free and commercial. Honestly if you have the disk space I’d download a few solutions to see what fits you best. Also note that I always install VIM/GVIM on my computers even if I don’t use it regularly. It is just a good thing to have a light weight editor on a computer for those odd cases where a IDE will not open a file.
Python has a typing system in the form of type-hints, but I fail to see why that's an example for the need of it. Care to explain?
Whoa here. If you are about to embark on a bit of work study you are woefully unprepared. You need a crash course in basic operating system skills and command line navigation.
So you are just domain squatting hoping to sell it off for a few hundred? Hah fuck off. You didn't even come up with a half decent domain name.
I can't figure it out. The program is really cool though.
Uh no. I’ve just had it for a few years and don’t use it. I was seeing what my options were.
I absolutely hate eclipse lol, I use it to code for micro controllers for projects in school. But ill look more into what you said, I have no idea what most of those things are. I googled VIM, that seems a bit advanced for me but definitely something id like to eventually get to work with. I think ill start with pycharm and get the basics down so I can understand the language more then switch to some better IDE's!
Python isn't really the best language for 3D games and gaming. You could checkout pygame. Or learn C# and try unity for a more fully fledged devkit.
Yah lol I work 6am to 2:30 so ill watch tutorials after work and try to learn some during work. I found a list of projects on r/Python that I can try out with increasing difficulty. But I hope by august I can create the inventory / production planning system
Haha it was just a joke
It's [documented](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/webbrowser.html#webbrowser.open): &gt; Note that on some platforms, trying to open a filename using this function, may work and start the operating system’s associated program. However, this is neither supported nor portable.
In a sense. The terminal has access to the entire file system, so you just need to navigate to the containing directory and run: python filename
Neovim + coc.nvim
webbrowser uses `xdg-open` internally which can open pretty much anything using the default associations. [https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Lib/webbrowser.py#L437](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Lib/webbrowser.py#L437)
Yeah it's definitely the extra 10% effort to have a nice UI and rendering that can really take a cool project to a wow project.
Purely academic exercises to scratch an itch, because it's there. Heh, I've had weekends like that.
I tried without the parenthesises and it still didn’t work
Yes I see it now, thanks for pointing it out. Not exactly clear though (to a noob like me). What I like about it is it does not open a browser and automatically uses associated program if any.
Thanks for the link, will have to look at xdg. Not being a Linux user for long so never heard of it before. Thanks.
`print` is the function, the first set of parentheses are for the arguments. The string you want to format should be directly next to the "arguments" for the formatting and inside the parentheses for the function call: print("String: %s" % "some string")
It was inspired by [this episode](https://pythonbytes.fm/episodes/show/116/so-you-want-python-in-a-3d-graphics-engine) of the wonderful podcast [Python Bytes](https://pythonbytes.fm/) . An itch has certainly been scratched!
_trying_ to build a wordfind puzzle generator, so far it feels like the most complex logic I've written in code.
Holy shit we're entering an age where grandparents watch(ed) anime.
name = cortland print( 'my name is' + name ) Is this what you were trying to do?
Why not do `print("My name is {}".format(name))
Put a comma after the name variable
Notice!
I see you don't understand what domain squatting is. ie) purchasing a domain name that you think may have value but that you yourself have no intention of using.
Lols, good one! I ran it and I got psycopg2, it's something I wanted anyways!
Cool project and thanks for sharing your learning journey. Very helpful learning myself right now.
_PLEASE_ don’t post images of your code; just post your code, properly formatted. Assuming you’re using Python 3 this: print (“Hello %s”) % (“World”) Looks to Python like this: print(“Hello %s”) % “World” Because **print** is a function and the first set of parentheses tell Python that you want to call **print** with the argument inside those parentheses. The second set of parentheses did nothing whatsoever (you’re not building a tuple and they don’t change order or evaluation) so they’re basically ignored. Now since **print** is a function that returns None you’ll see “Hello %s” in your terminal, and then you’ve got this: None % “World” At which point you’ll get a TypeError because None doesn’t support the % operator (it’s neither a format string or a number to modulo divide by). Try this instead: print(“Hello %s” % “World”) And it should work.
Another +1 for Pycharm. I use IDEA IDEs for pretty much all of my development so I'm a little biased, but I really like it. Community Edition is free as others have said.
&gt; name = cortland print( 'my name is' + name ) Is this what you were trying to do? Needs a space.
wow GOD like!

Is this machine learning?? I'm mostly doing web stuff but holy shit I gotta get on that ML
Thank you! As you might be able to tell I’m new to coding and codecademy works writing it like how I wrote it, but the app I use on my phone works the way you wrote it. Is it possible that codecademy is showing python 2 and the app is showing python 3?
vscode \\w (remote development + python extension) or pycharm. But lately I have been using vscode more and more
I understand and agree with the usefulness of type hinting and validation... but damn does it make Python code cluttered compared to without :(
Yes, last I checked CodeAcademy wasn’t updated for Python 3, and glancing at it now it’s only got Python 3 available on their paid Pro subscription. Which, incidentally, I’m going to suggest can’t possibly be worth the price they’re asking. In Python 2 **print** was a keyword, not a function, and so _all_ the parentheses in the original string were simply ignored, so yes it would work. The function form is much more powerful and useful though.
We do what we must, because we can.
Selfishness. That's all you defending.
For the good of all of us (except the ones who are dead)
May i ask how long it would take one to do exactly those steps? :) amazing work!
I really don't understand how this is selfishness at all. Would you please elaborate?
Ok thank you
This is a great list. Clear that you actually put some work into selecting these. Agree that it's not "the" most popular, but honestly that list would probably be less informative.
This is fucking brilliant, man! I'm in awe. Congratulations!
This is so cool!
I had no idea sudokus can have multiple solutions

Purchasing a domain name without knowing what you'll use it for is a really dumb financial decision.
But there's no sense crying over every mistake.
Luckily $1 won’t kill me
Thanks... Have looked at the alternatives and at the moment it seems I need a DB with time series capabilities with full text search capabilities. In short, elasticsearch fits the bill best as I see it. Although, I am still keen on trying some of the alternatives mentioned and play around with them.
Thanks, your project sounds cool and certainly gives me some ideas. However, I am keen on using dash as the dashboard app for 2 reasons - one, I don't want to divert myself towards JS and web app development much and second, dash seems to have all the graphing and visualization capabilities that I need at the moment. Just as a proof of concept of this project of mine, I created the first cut using pandas data frames and then sending those to dash to view in tabular format. However, I have decided instead to use a DB to store the parsed data that I can retrieve and have text search upon via the dash app. Let's see how I get there.
I am going back and learning the basics of Python this week. I have a small amount of experience using Python in a previous CS course, but I want to explore and increase my understanding. Since school is out I have a bit of time on my hands so I really want to focus on data analysis because it seems to draw my attention. In the past, I used matplotlib and KNN to work with a loan data set to predict loan risk and I had fun with that. I know there are other cool things I can do with Python so I'll just be taking the next few weeks watching YouTube tutorials and looking for projects.
Please pick a License ASAP. It is very important to protect your copyright or that someone doesn't steals your work... It is also useful for making sure you are not liable for anything that this might be used for. I recommend MIT or 3-claus BSD but don't let it be in the public domain like this. Other than that, really cool project. Really cool, Thanks for sharing.
You just keep on trying till you run out of cake
What program do u use for your phone?
How long did it take to finish?
astroboy came out in the 1960s, I'm sure quite a few gramps have watched/heard of that one
And the science gets done, and you make a big gun, for the people who are still alive.
You should probably just try and see for yourself. I would suggest implementing both methods abd comparing them with timeit
timeit?
It’s a standard library module to measure execution time of small code snippets. And, if you are using Jupyter Notebooks or Ipython, it is implemented with a %timeit magic A simple google search will surely suggest some comprehensive examples
It is impossible. Here a.update({3:"demo"}) it is possible, because you put the dictionary object into the update function.

If the python script accesses the web via selenium and navigates to a few web pages would it still work?
I approve
Vim is preinstalled on MacOS I think. Just type `vim` into the terminal, altough it might be a better idea to type `vimtutor` first. Its a nice tutorial which will teach you all the basics.
Oh yah it is, just tried it. Im currently watching this video to learn more lol [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfscVS0vtbw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfscVS0vtbw)
Oh sure. Pygame zero isn't something I've got experience with personally, but it does look like real code to me. It seems to mostly be abstracting away writing an event loop and that sort of thing. That said, if she's at a point where she will understand what purpose the things it abstracts away have and maybe want to fiddle with them, then I'd definitely recommend it!
Proper ones can't. But if less than 17 clues are given in the beginning you'll come up with multiple solutions.
Without a separator between the characters, the only thing I could spontaneously think of would be regular expressions. You could do something like import re some_numbers_string = '-1-23' some_pattern = re.compile(r'-?\d') some_numbers_list = re.findall(some_pattern, some_numbers_string)
you will need to iterate instead of using split function. But I'm not it'll be possible because of how ambiguous it'll become. How do you know '-21' is - 2 and 1 and not just -21? 🤔
After a successful industrial vision analysis system I developed from scratch for a customer of mine last year with no past experience whatsoever, and since then I'm getting orders over orders for new vision systems. I'm working on the 5th project with a 6th already lined up, and if this keeps up I'll have to hire someone to help me with the developing. I think I found my niche market, at least for now.
Or create your own decorators that handle all this for you. Then the mess can be in that module and not in your current code. "Sweep it under the rug!"
Thank you so much for that, I just added it.
Very cool. Using opencv or a more commercial solution?

This is awesome
pytest plugin for using virtual environments in tests. There's already a few, but I have some ideas for making it faster that don't really fit into the existing libraries.
You may use ints in the map, but not in the parameter list; does this help? def addEntry(a, **kwargs): print("before:\n\t", a) a.update(kwargs) print("after:\n\t", a) new_entries = {3: 'demo', 4: 'install'} a = {'test': 2} addEntry(a, kwargs=new_entries)
What algorithm did you use to solve?
This works too, but a counter is probably more self-documenting: def is_anagram(x, y): return sorted(x) == sorted(y)
I second this! OP has an incredible real-world outcome from his Python journey. The key is he had the brains for it at 13, so obviously our own "mileage will vary".
Ah neural nets. &amp;#x200B; The "bootstrap it and call it a day" of data science. &amp;#x200B; Out of curiosity, was there a reason you chose that instead of some other modeling method?
Good question. I should have specified but never thought of how ambiguous it was until U pointed it out. There are only single digit numbers. So if it should split on everything that is not a minus sign. `[-3-21]` can only ever been `-3,-2,1` since `21` does not exist.
&gt;This is what I need. I tried almost this exact thing but it didn't work. What does the `r'` mean? &gt; &gt;Thanks!!
Interesting commits * f-string debugging. * `python -m asyncio` gives a async repl that supports top level await statements. * unittest.mock now has AsyncMock that can mock async for, async with and other async related code. * math.comb to compute binomial coefficients. math.perm and math.isqrt were added. * unittest gained support for async test case. * importlib.metadata got merged providing API to access package metadata. * Threading module now has an API to get native thread ID. * multiprocessing.parent_process got added. PEPs merged. 4 PEPs were merged in a single day with a week before beta release. * [Runtime audit hooks got merged PEP 578](https://bugs.python.org/issue36842) * typing related PEPs were merged : Add final qualifier (PEP 591), Literal types (PEP 586) and TypedDict (PEP 589) * [Python embedding got better with PEP 587](https://bugs.python.org/issue36763) * [Vectorcall for functions got merged PEP 590](https://bugs.python.org/issue36922) * [New pickle protocol with performance improvements PEP 574](https://bugs.python.org/issue36785)

I'm not sure if I'm understanding correctly, but if you just want to sum up the values along the first axis then you should use numpy's sum method while specifying what axis to sum along. If you want to represent missing data then I'd recommend using masked arrays, though if you're only interested in summing then zero values may be better.
Updated my link to add more correct velocity adding. I also separated the mass and size, so that they don't get to large. In addition I added a feature that the "screen" will center on the average center of all planets. You are more than welcome to steal what you want. :)
in Ukrainian and Russian it’s “the mess”, probably, in some other languages it’s also has similar connotation

What are you using to execute your code?
You shouldn’t be getting any error. Yea what are you using to run this code ?

I’d assume this is inherited from mom.genes or dad.genes. Though those feel like they should actually be init parameters. Given that class inheritance models “is a” or “behaves like a” behavior, then I’d think that Sophia should inherit from whatever type(mom) and/or type(dad) is. All pedantry aside, congratulations!

**solved** &amp;#x200B; Sorry! I accidentally figured out what I was doing wrong smh
The regex for minimum valid keywords/functions/identifiers is `VALID_NAME_REGEX = re.compile(r'[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*')`. - Has to be at least 1 character long (implying string) - Has to start with a-z or `_` - Can contain letters, numbers or underscore There are probably special cases and maximums, but shows why you can't use numbers.
I'm finishing up the rebuild of my twitter bot and adding tests so when I upgrade the pi it runs on I can more readily see what is still broken, and I'm building a topological data analysis library. Right now I'm just outlining what I need, and what functions are needed to make that work, but hopefully it'll be lightweight and easy to quickly see how data varies along some dimension.
Likely.

Be very transparent. Talk them through how you problem solve as if you are a subpar programmer. Great way of learning is by attempting to run a script, read through any raised errors, and correcting the code.

OK I think I managed to get it working. The fps is quite slow and instead of printing it in the shell, I used the Python Turtle Graphics. I think that is the most I could do and this would most probably crash if I added anything onto it. Thanks!

'Bardak' is Hebrew slang for joyful mess.
while(True): cry() time.sleep(30)
CRINGE
Are you sure it isn't just "sleep()"? :-)
Bardak means mess :) originally Russian as others have pointed out but in this case Hebrew slang.
His name is boaz. Also Hebrew inherited a lot of Russian slang; bardak, debil, zhouk, halatura, soler, kibinimat, rogatka and many more
Making a wrapper for GPSBabel. It is a open source program that converts GPS file formats. My school uses GPS's to track our aircraft fleet (flight school) so that students can review their flight path. I am making a Python script that takes in the GPX file from the GPS, converts it to KML for viewing in Google Earth, and then will email the student the file from their flight and stores it in a database with a formatted file name.
"probably" because mother's name is Arabian
I really think you should do things like that yourself (especially because those tasks seem quite trivial (as in just require a basic understanding of the language))... I'm a bit bored so if you really want to cheat here is how I would solve the first task (hint: your Teacher probably expects you to use multiple if else conditionals): &gt;!def atLeast2(a, b, c):!&lt; &gt;!if set(\[a, b, c\]).\_\_len\_\_() &gt; 2:!&lt; &gt;!return False!&lt; &gt;!return True!&lt;
From the sounds of your approach there won't be any issues until you are trying to make your 15th file for a method that is pretty similar to method 11. Also, now you are stuck trying to think of a descriptive and succinct name for your 15th file. I've been here and it is fine for very small projects but as it grows you start to wish you could just add another method to a broad "meta" class and have one easy import statement eg. From my_project import custom_method_description_12 Vs From my_project import scraper_methods.instagram_scrape_method
Why? Seaborn is literally just a code that sits on top of matplotlib.
Hey! Thank you so much for your help. I didn't realize this was against the rules for this subreddit and posted it on the appropriate subreddit just now. Of course these questions may seem trivial, as I'm assuming you've worked on Python projects FAR beyond my understanding, however, these are going to be some of the, if not the, hardest questions on the test. Thank you SO much for helping me out with the first one, as I'm not only a beginner in Python overall, but not stellar in the introductory class I'm taking either (it was a mandatory class to take, and although I actually do enjoy the class, I most likely wouldn't take it if I had a choice to, knowing how poor I am in this field). For comparison with a few other main topics on the final, it will mostly be dealing with the "Turtle" import, if-statements, loops, as well as touching a bit on classes (I peeped the explanation they gave for it on r/learnpython). So, yeah, this is one of the harder topics we've covered lol. &amp;#x200B; Anyway, again, thank you for taking the time to help out. Have a good night! :)
Interesting. French has bordel (brothel / mess) and débile (malnourished / stupid) from those as well.
Hebrew has the same. And also classeur, ventilateur, and other French words too.
I'm taking down this post because it violates community guidelines, so that's why it's gone.
Wouldn’t you print(“what is your name”) the. Do name = input()

I wonder which way the borrowings happened for bordel/bardak and débile/debil between French, Roshan, and Hebrew.
I'd guess from Russian to both, independently.

The netstat example on this page loops but by using read(1) on the pipe, there won't be any delay between output becoming available and when the python script reads it.

Ive only hired one analyst so take my subpar managerial skills with a grain of salt. I like to ask somewhat vague questions on the job requirements and see where they take the answers. For example if I ask about familiarity with demand planning and forecasting, does the response indicate a familiarity with seasonal forecasting models? To me it's not important that you use one specific method - but you should be able to justify your choice rationally and explain it. Or, what is your experience with tying data together from different sources? Then let the candidate bring up ETL code. I may ask questions about their comfort level with designing experiments for marketing teams. What type of things interest you? Your chance to go off on your passion projects that tie directly to the role.

**God object** In object-oriented programming, a God object is an object that knows too much or does too much. The God object is an example of an anti-pattern. A common programming technique is to separate a large problem into several smaller problems (a divide and conquer strategy) and create solutions for each of them. Once the smaller problems are solved, the big problem as a whole has been solved. *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Python/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28
&gt; If I'm putting my classes in separate files Why are you copying bad habits from the Java community? One class per file is an anti-pattern, a bad habit which is totally unnecessary. Especially if the classes are small, or closely related, or share code. &gt; is there any benefit to declaring the classes again in the files? Python doesn't have declarations. (Unless you count the `global` and `nonlocal` keywords, or type annotations.) What do you mean by "declaring the classes again"? &gt; so far I've avoided using any classes and it seems to work perfectly. So... you've written a bunch of classes in separate files that you don't actually use?
A lot of people learn in different ways. Some do well with videos, others by reading, others by doing. Once you find out what works, you're golden. I learn best by project-focused study. I'll do a few lessons on Codeacademy then think to myself, "But how can I do this thing?" I'll start with the tools that I know to get a basic backbone of the project then go on Openstack, read the docs, go on websites, crack open a book or my notes. I'll pull together multiple sources and through hours of bug chasing have a better understanding than when I started. The more interesting the project, the better. On my workbench right now is a text based recreation of a FFVIII battle, with if-else statements, functions, while loops. Basic stuff to start, but I'm planning to learn classes to make it smoother. I'm also doing a paycheck calculator, which will take the local date and tell me what my paychecks should be for the month and when I'll get paid. Hope you find what works!
I started using opencv but actually I developed my own analysis algorithms. Point is, the application is so specialized that it's more efficient and easy to do it this way. Lately for a color sequence recognition system I used Tensorflow to have a neural network give me a OK/KO flag. I was a little worried about using neural networks in the industrial field, but it has worked so good and so much better than the ~~crap~~ software that Keyence sold them which was based on color tables that I'm sold to the technology, at least when false positives / negatives are acceptable.

I tried to import a banana, and it didn't work. But seriously... if you still have to write a method to actually read the file and make sense of it, why not just do that? How does pretending the data is a module help you write better, more maintainable code? # Your way # write a json loader as a staticmethod in a class with json_imports: import foo process(foo.data) # The conventional way # write a json loader as a function data = load_json("foo.json") process(data) I know which one I'd rather read when maintaining code. I don't see any benefit to the magic import, especially since the *hard part* (loading the content of the file) still has to be done by the caller.
Nah, breathing runs on the subconscious daemon thread
With that multiple inheritance I hope you both have no common ancestors.
That one is good, worth noting counter is more efficient as you only pass through the string once.
Sorry, but that's really cringey
Watching video from the start is not the best learning strategy in programming. In my opinion, better way is active reading such practical books as Automate the Boring Stuff wih Python, Fluent Python, articles from RealPython. What do i mean on active reading? You read one chapter, and again start do the same thing in python shell - dirty hands approach works excellent: you remember better actually start to understand what's going on. You should work a lot in python shell to get in touch with structures, logic, syntax. Next you can watch tutorials, i recommend YouTube channel Corey Shafer and python tuts from Freecodecamp.
Ok then, take a look on github issue and take one :)
It's a set of interview problems. Those basically always start with "assume that every copy of the standard library and every third-party package everywhere on earth was just wiped by the Mad Degausser, how would you implement this". (which is a terrible way to interview people, but is nonetheless a very common way to interview people)

&gt; How so? You wrote qt apps? Too many. &gt; I use qtpy as a layer between pyqt4, pyqt5, pyside, and pyside2 so I write once and run on any of them. YAGNI. &gt; I don’t know any of them, yet I know all of them. When you go out and apply for jobs, you have to put what you know on your cv. when interviewers ask you what you know, they want to know that you know the pyqt api, because that's the one they are most likely to use and require, not a fancy wrapper on top which only a handful of people use. This is especially true for junior developers, as when you are senior you are basically able to find your way easily on a new API. You are only as productive as the APIs you know and can type quickly. A programming language is your grammar, and APIs are your vocabulary.

Oh sorry, Yeah I'm using MySQL and sqlalchemy.
I don't get to use Py much, so I basically jump at every chance. still being &gt;90% noob, Ill try anything and everything, even the most boring of projects as you can only learn by doing, getting wrong, reading up and doing again.. So this week, I have built a text version of our (The TV company I work for at the mo as a BA) pass management system. This might sound basic and well it kinda is, but, we have a few countries where the rules vary and so its been interesting building them in and using Pandas to manage numbers etc.. Once built, it has been handy to test logic designs against it and I hope that I can keep it updated to test changes wanted to the platform and how that will impact the logic etc.. &amp;#x200B; Anyway, anyone got any good links on understanding the self class stuff.. I just don't get it.. :)

Cool. I once taught an intro class and our final project was a sudoku solver using a brute force algorithm. I’ve always been interested in other algorithms for sudoku. Even have one in Answer Set Programming (ASP) that’s like 9 lines. Cool stuff.

Very Nice. You could pass that into an app, so anyone could take their own GPS data and see their trip on Google Earth, Plane, Boat, Car, bike etc.. You thought about reversing it as well, so that you could plot on Google Earth and load the route into the GPS (not sure if that would work or not tech wise? )
I'm sure the intentions were good, but I can't help but agree with you.
Indeed it is. I was oversimplifying for the purpose of understanding. :)
Yes, you'd need to convert the user's input to an integer or floating point number: num1 = int(input("What's your first number? ")) num2 = int(input("What's your second number? ")) total = num1+num2 print(total) Or, num1 = float(input("What's your first number? ")) num2 = float(input("What's your second number? ")) total = num1+num2 print(total) Hope this helps!

Python and JavaScript have lots in common but they are used for different purposes. So the hate that you are talking it is not real, the hate may be individually to someone. But in general there should not be any hate between these two languages, they seem to interfere sometimes but i dont think the interference is so much for reaching hates. Personally i have no hates to JS programming, i have taken some tutorial for JS and as python user i feel comfortable with it (maybe it has to do with those commons things that you have mentioned). Good luck
I've only heard bad stuff about "learn Python 3 the hard way" especially that the author doesn't really know what he's doing, teaches deprecated stuff etc. etc. I don't know a good english book on Python but only heard good things about "Automate the boring stuff". Also sentdex and pythonprogrammer on yt are great resources, as are the official docs
I started Coursera's "Python 3 Programming Specialization" 3 weeks ago and now I'm in the second course of the specialization. It's my second try to learn python from the beginning and this time I started Udacity's "SQL for Data Analysis" in parallel with my Python Basics class. Also, I want to solve some problems on [Codewars.com](https://Codewars.com) to train myself. I have a plan for being a Data Analyst and have change in my career path.
What is cringey about it?

May be, but I've dived in Python using LPtHW book. Although it was my way, you can use a lot of different books to dive in. After reading one beginner book you not only know enough Python, in addition you get the idea on how to continue your journey through the programming world. So the most important thing in my opinion is part of learning after diving in, not the diving in itself. And yes, I've also heard about "Automate the boring stuff" but couldn't recommend as it is not the book that I learned from.
What is your end goal here?

I think the answer to this depends on how you will need to allow the end user to customize the reports. Two that come to mind are Metabase ([https://www.metabase.com/](https://www.metabase.com/)) or Plotly ([https://plot.ly/](https://plot.ly/)). &amp;#x200B; Metabase is more "baked" - you can just point it at your django DB and it is pretty intuitive how to use, but you will have to iFrame the dashboards back into your django app, so it makes the "configuration" requirement hard. &amp;#x200B; Plotly is less "baked" so will provide more flexibility, but will require some creative ways to render the plots / dashboards on the front end. Plotly also has a few flavors, python, JS, and Dash. I am not sure your experience level with Django or how you have your app set up - there are multiple ways to get Plots to render on front end depending on if you are rendering in pure HTML django templates or using a JS framework like Vue (which is what I am doing). &amp;#x200B; For simplicity and validating your fledgling idea, I would suggest start with Metabase and see if that can work. It will require a separate server to run but can easily be brought up in a container and pointed at your Django database using credentials in your [settings.py](https://settings.py). Hope this helps.
I’m creating a wrapper to link the variables to a FORTRAN program. the new C file will just make functions to copy the memory location for the different variables. Someone else is working on the FORTRAN side to be able to call my C functions.

Hi, yes I come from a java back ground. My understanding it's also best practice in the selenium automation framework to keep each page in a separate file. By not declaring classes I mean in each seperate file I don't begin with Class xyz: I essentially just have methods in the file, and use the separate files as though they were separate classes. I'm wondering if there's any benefit to declaring a class even though they're already segregated via files.
NO. And stop shouting.
Hi, yeah I can see that being a problem in the future as the project gets bigger.
 def go_to_sleep(): # TODO pass
nums = [] numsToEnter = int(input("How many numbers would you like to enter?")) for i in range(numsToEnter): num = int(input("Enter number: ")) nums.append(num) smallest = min(nums) biggest = max(nums) print("smallest is ", smallest) print("biggest is ", biggest) Probably something like this but try and get the min and max without using min() and max()

Don't mind me asking, but how do you know what a valid word is? Do you have a file containing all the words in the English language?

This is great answer. Thanks for the help. I'm really new to Django as s framework, but pretty good at python (I think!). I will try to make I metabase as a starting point and then if anybody actually uses the app I can upgrade to a better paid service.

`random.choices` was added due to [issue 18844](https://bugs.python.org/issue18844).
How are you planning to import the data into python? CSV file, database import, or just instancing the data within the script for now?
The easiest way is to write a script that you would use instead of the shortcut for the game. The script would go through and start each dependency program, followed by PoE itself. Although you can do this with Python (`subprocess`), it's probably easier to just do it in a batch file or Powershell script [Simple batch file example](https://serverfault.com/questions/67636/how-can-i-start-multiple-programs-simultaneously): start /d "C:\Path\To\Dependency\One" DependencyOne.exe start /d "C:\Path\To\Dependency\Two" DepencyTwo.exe start /d "C:\Path\To\Path\Of\Exile" PathofExile.exe
Just within the script for now, our part volumes are small enough that it isn't too much of an inconvenience. Once everything is squared away I'll likely make edits to import the data as we have a lot of different part numbers and may not run the same one again for months at a time.
Multiple choice
Anytime. Think that's a good choice. Metabase is solid, and you might be able to allow them to have some configuration ability if you are okay giving them access with a Metabase login (and it would then be obvious you were using metabase for analytics if that is material to you). In that case, they would have extreme flexibility in building their own graphs as it is extremely business user friendly. The difficulty here would be dynamically rendering the user created dashboards, not knowing in advance how many a user might need to create. This could be possible but pulling a metabase API that defined the dashboards per user and then a for loops to render them into iFrames upon request, but I haven't personally done this. &amp;#x200B; One more thing I forgot to mention, not sure if you are looking B2B or B2C, but if B2B and you need multi-tenant, Metabase might present slightly more of a challenge as you will have to recreate dashboards for each Tenant (schema if using schema level isolation). If the end user is responsible for making their own dashboards, this isn't an issue. Good luck!
So they can make multiple identical copies... suspicious 🤔 But seriously you could explain it by the fact that they wanted to override some methods (like `live()`), to be different from the parents. But yeah you'd want it do be a singleton class to really make sense.
Check out some processor benchmarks. https://cpu.userbenchmark.com/Compare/Intel-Core-i7-8565U-vs-AMD-Ryzen-5-2500U/m591977vsm378273 The intel seems the better option based solely on cpu performance.

Personally i'd go for the ryzen 5/7 as it probably will be much cheaper than the i7 and give the same-ish performance. If you do any cad work then a gpu will be very useful, especially if you use software which has gpu acceleration. Python doesn't require much processing power at all, it's quite lightweight for the most part and all depends on what you're developing. If you want to use VM's and such then # of cores will be very important, otherwise choose a relatively high clock speed for a cpu, something from around 3.5+.
I can’t post pictures on the learn python sub
Already messing up and not properly following pep8....
What are some of unexpected consequences? Also it makes sense for tuple unpacking to happen RH first. A common use for it is swapping variable. `x , y = x + y, x` Furthermore it's consistent with how python evalutates single variable expressions: `x = x + 1`
You should try some of them. Qtpy was written by the authors of Spyder. It’s small, but it isn’t my backyard package. I laugh at anyone still writing python 2 only code when they could use six and support both. Same for anybody who writes serious qt apps in python and doesn’t use qtpy. Shoot, my backyard package is a fancy wrapper only used by a few people, and yet it got me a nice new job. There is nothing wrong with well done wrappers.
You should never post pictures of code anyways. It's not a useful way to get help. Use https://gist.github.com or https://pastebin.com and share the link that way, or just copy and paste the code.
That is extremely dumb. A person is an instance of a human. Also the inheritance is dumb. She should be inheriting from mammal, not from x.genes, which is also stupid as it implies that there is a class stored in attribute that has lowercase first letter. Her parents are the kind of programmers that do not care about naming conventions and they should be executed or at least fired. Ok, let's say one would write this piece of retarted "art". Assuming there is go_to_sleep method implemented in dad.genes class, the kid would most likely sleep like an adult. Kids need way more sleep and only sick fuck would make them sleep like an adult. PS. The documentation is awful. Please add some multiprocessing so we can get into the part where we execute and kill the children.
Hi there, from the /r/Python mods. We have removed this post as it is not suited to the /r/Python subreddit proper, however it should be very appropriate for our sister subreddit /r/LearnPython or for the r/Python discord: https://discord.gg/3Abzge7. The reason for the removal is that /r/Python is dedicated to discussion of Python news, projects, uses and debates. It is not designed to act as Q&amp;A or FAQ board. The regular community is not a fan of "how do I..." questions, so you will not get the best responses over here. On /r/LearnPython the community and the r/Python discord are actively expecting questions and are looking to help. You can expect far more understanding, encouraging and insightful responses over there. **No matter what level of question you have, if you are looking for help with Python, you should get good answers**. Make sure to check out the rules for both places. Warm regards, and best of luck with your Pythoneering!

&gt; There's often a lot of hate and criticism between the two languages, as they are consistently competing for the top spot as world's most used programming language That sounds toxic as hell. I've not experienced any hate between the languages. From the python side I really never hear Javascript mentioned. Maybe it's because I'm not involved in Twitter discussions or something similar though.
&gt; You should try some of them. Uhm no? &gt; Qtpy was written by the authors of Spyder. It’s small, but it isn’t my backyard package. I laugh at anyone still writing python 2 only code when they could use six and support both. You have very little understanding of real companies out there, and quality of developers out there. &gt; Same for anybody who writes serious qt apps in python and doesn’t use qtpy. Again, why? It's pointless to use. If you are a company and need to develop a UI, you don't need a wrapper that abstracts away which specific pyqt wrapper you are using. You pick one and stick with it.

Pick one? We just went through this with python 2...when your company hadn’t upgraded to python 3, were you writing python 3 compatible code? I was. Does your app only support one version of your dependencies? Mine don’t. Do you know the range of dependencies you support and do you know what breaks for each version you move away from that? I do. If I don’t care about fancy new feature x, I don’t need to update my dependencies. Picking more than one is a great way to improve the robustness of your GUI. It’s also really nice when you switch versions of python and your code still works. My GUI tools can be used outside my specific GUI. A legend or animation menu is pretty generic. Different projects have their own requirements and it’s rarely your task to lock them in. Requirements change over time, so when it’s suddenly a disaster your GUI is python 2 only, you don’t also need to upgrade all your dependencies that you were locked into for 7 years.
So being alive is the instance running. Ok
Sounds reasonable!
Yup! That is all possible with GPSBabel. The great thing about it is that you can call all the functions in GPSBabel from the terminal which you can control from Python.
Categorization is always very useful
This is the most neckbeardy post I've seen here, do you code everything in Assembly? &amp;#x200B; Are you on Linux from scratch? Do you write all your programs that you use for daily use in a OS?
PyCharm as the IDE. Set it up nice for her. You've set up plenty of IDEs so I'm sure you can make PyCharm pretty kid friendly. You could start a couple of empty template projects for her to fill in with her own code. Going from Scratch to writing a "game" in Python is a stretch. Think wwaaayyyy back to the first year or two and ask yourself if you could have taken on writing a game while also learning your first real programming language. By "game" I mean video game. If, however, you're talking guess a number type games then you're going in a good direction. Hangman? Tic Tac using a GUI. If she wants to use a GUI to make a game, I would stay away from the big frameworks for the same reason I would stay away from PyGame at first. It's a critical time for her. Successes is what she needs. Positive reinforcement. Projects she can grow on, but not become so frustrated that she gives up.
This probably doesn't matter to most python and macOS users since they likely have a separate version installed (and hopefully Python 3 but that's a different topic) but it may matter for those who distribute scripts, etc and do not currently package a python executable with it. I just thought it would be of interest to (some of) this audience
I find the questions being asked on here to be a bit annoying but I think that is because they are *supposed* to be on /r/LearnPython. If the decision is to allow them here, I think it *may* be okay. Honestly, I guess it is worth an experiment but we really do need to think of it as such. For example, the /r/matlab sub (I originally came to python from matlab) is super annoying with the excess of the same, super simple, easily-googled question. Not that is doesn't happen here too (How many times a week do we get "What's the best IDE?" posts?). A positive of this change would be for posts that really straddle the line. For example, an experienced python programmer may have a rather advanced question, but it is unclear if it should be learnpython since it isn't news or in the main python sub since it is well beyond the beginner stage (not that you aren't learning at the advanced one but it may be a different audience) So, FWIW, on an *experimental* basis I think it may be worth trying! I will say that the misery it adds will change with the time of year. Early falls sees a bunch of new coders and the resulting questions
More, there are legit strategies that exploit the fact that there can't be multiple solutions.
I don't see the harm. Why is it bad to have Q&amp;A discussions here? To follow the rules? Why do we have this rule? What value is there in shutting down discussion in a discussion forum?
Yes thanks god
Yes flairs would be great. We add a "Help" flair and then auto delete that post with a message to go to learnpython
What about Kivy?
This is great. It means homebrew can install python 3.x as “python” now instead of “python3”. I suppose that it removes the old python 2.7 if you upgrade in-place? Did they move their old python-using scripts to swift?
Subreddits help organize content and allows individuals to subscribe to the content they want. There is a subreddit dedicated to learning Python and getting help with python, r/learnpython. If someone is interested in that content, they should subscribe to that subreddit. That "help content" should not be allowed here since it has its own dedicated subreddit. This subreddit should only have content that relates to its purpose. People who are interested in this, can subscribe to r/python. If someone is interested in both, they subscribe to both. Right now, there's no way to escape the help questions and the same "besy way to learn python? Which ide to use?" posts EVERY SINGLE DAY.
Yeah I see your point, and I’m not trying to split hairs about it. I am aware however, that beginners and people getting into a new language may stumble across repos like this and be unaware of the implied context. But I agree this interview practice is frustrating. If you want to test my knowledge of algo design, test pseudo code. If you want to test my knowledge of a language and its best principles, then let me code it using the accepted standard libs/trusted 3rd party libs
Thank you!
Are you sure that’s what it does? The linked article says that future versions won’t ship with scripting languages but it only says that they’re *deprecated* for this version. Has anyone installed the beta? I would like to see them gone so that homebrew python 3.x can use the “python” name, not “python3”. Just recently, for me, it was confusing poetry which was making virtualenvs using the system python 2.7.
You'll have better luck if you search for **Android** development.

It's remarkable how many developers choose Python because it is easy, and then get offended when Python is referred to as "easy." Meanwhile, developers who have worked with other languages agree that yes, Python is easy.
Im very new to learning Python and CS Dojo on youtube seems to be good, but since Im so new I don't really have much to go on so I will check out some of the other recommended channels here
I start with a simple list of words and insert them one at a time checking for bounds and overlap. Ideally once the code is functional you could feed whatever list of words you wanted and it will fill those in then drop random characters in any remaining unused spaces to fill the grid completely
Python is easier than most to initially understand but to complete dismiss it is the most arrogant and asinine thing you can do. I would never hire a programmer that looks down on python as 'too easy' because they're the kind of idiot that'll spend 2 weeks on a project in c# when it would have taken 3 hours in python. Your attitude is incorrect.
Pretty sure Gokus dad ist called Bardock
This is interesting. Focusing on the idea that users don't get answers on /r/learnpython: With the helper bot, I've watched the /r/learnpython subreddit, and to me it looks like the rate of useful engagement is higher on that subreddit. While it's not instantaneous, within a 24 hour period there's usually a suggestion plus a request for clarification of the OPs post. After that it usually waits on OP to reply. Frequently from there there's a reply and a followup, and that either answers the question, or waits for OP. It does sometimes expand beyond that, but by that point I'd argue the OP has received help. Learning questions on this sub usually get shallow engagement, and most of that engagement is to direct them to /r/learnpython. There's also a correct way to ask a question, and most users don't do that right away. (And that's perfectly fine given that the OP is able to clarify later on) A lot of the posts asking questions on this sub that I've seen don't do that. (They either are missing example code, don't include the error, or don't indicate what they assume the code is doing vs what they see the code doing). So not getting help isn't a direct argument in favor or against a sub if there are commenters asking for clarification and OP never replies. Then there's the issue of advanced or very specific questions. Those require someone familiar with both the subject matter and the library, so failing to get engagement on the learnpython sub makes sense just on a breadth of userbase. Those questions have a better shot at getting useful engagement on this sub, but it's still not a very solid shot at getting an answer. The better place to go with those sorts of questions is either stack overflow, the source documentation, or github to submit an issue. In short, I don't feel like removing questions necessarily stopped them from getting an answer. It could, but it also could be a question no one engages in a useful capacity. To the purposed solution: I like the idea of flair. I think it should be tested in a demo capacity first, but if the sub as a whole seems to enjoy it, I think it's a good idea. I think we should be mindful that submission behavior changes in the summer vs school year because of students taking programming courses and asking for help with assignments. So the usefulness of the flair now compared to in August/September might change.
Check the variable names
"No escape" is not accurate when you can just scroll down 30 pixels. I get the desire to separate content, I just don't share that frustration. I barely notice when someone posts something that doesn't interest me. I move my thumb 1cm and I never think of it again. Meanwhile, people who are interested are having a discussion. An analogy would walking in to a room called "The Python Room" with hundreds of people having conversations in different corners and then demanding everyone asking questions to leave the room and go to "The Python Kid Zone" room instead. Just... stop listening to conversations that don't interest you. If you hear people getting heated, or someone posts about .NET, then yeah. Show them the door. I see no harm in rich, in-depth discussions to thoughtful questions in a forum meant to talk about Python. It feels very thought-police-ish. "NO ASK, ONLY TELL."
Here ya go: `name = input("what iz ur nme:")` `if name == "zach":` `print("fbi is watching you")` `else:` `print("Keep up the good work")`
I didn’t know another way to show exactly what was happening so I just posted a picture instead of the normal way
Look at your example. You're agreeing with me! Python: 3 hours. C#: 2 weeks. So, how much easier is Python? A lot.
Gracias, my dude
And guess who I will contract for an app, the person who will get it done in 3 hours. Just because something is time consuming or more advanced doesn't make it harder or more valuable. Just because nuclear thermal radiation engines work, doesn't mean they're better than liquid hydrogen and LOX for getting off the ground.
&gt; There is a subreddit dedicated to learning Python and getting help with python, r/learnpython This is not a worthwhile argument. There are also a series of other subreddits: * /r/pythonnews * /r/pythontips * /r/python_netsec * /r/python3 * /r/Python2 * /r/pythondev Following your reasoning, we can't post anything about Python3 in this subreddit, or Python2. Are we only allowed to talk about Python1, or potentially what's going to happen with Python4 and beyond? And should we just hope that nobody makes /r/Python4 so that we can still talk about that? Just because another subreddit exists, that does not in any way mean that the topic is not also relevant to this subreddit.
Well, Bardak means glass (as in water glass or shot glass) in turkish. What a coincidence.
I find using pyenv with the virtualenv plugin works well for creating venvs for spesific version. Poetry will pick up whatever env is active.
Mods, OP account is pure spam, please ban it.
Yeah Eclipse is a mess! It is unfortunate but that PyDev runs there as PyDev is well done. PyCharm sound like a good fit.
We just need a bot that copy pastes 'how to' questions into stack overflow and spits out a link to the results.
Getting into programming in the first place lololol
Why can't you conceive that 1 programmer might know more than 1 language? I would do it in Python, take the money, and think, "that was easy." And I would greatly appreciate all the programmers who wrote all the libraries that it made possible. And, that's my point. If it's really a 2-week project and I can do it in only 3 hours, who really did most of the programming?
I think this is a perfectly reasonable approach. I’d like to see it get a chance.
So they’re still keeping python3? “Will no longer ship with Python” makes it sound like no python2 or python3. I’m just confused by the title
If I say `x, d[x] = 4, 8`, I'd expect that to be the same as `d[x], x = 8, 4`. Unless `x` was already 4 before, it won't be (difference is similar to `x++` vs `++x` I guess). Similarly if doing `a.b = f()` can have strange consequences if `f()` changes which object `a` refers to. I guess being able to say `x, x["a"] = {}, 4` can be nice in some (very few) cases, though…? As for the dict comprehension, def delId(x): del x["id"] return x items = {x["id"]: delId(x) for x in items} I would expect that code to take a list of items containing an `id` field, and get a dict with those ids as keys. Instead, I get a KeyError because the field has already been deleted.
Stack Overflow is a phenomenal resource, but I think it can be daunting for people who don't know what they're doing. Having someone provide a reasonable and friendly link to Stack Overflow is actually a pretty great result for most people.
Kite is now "cloudless" and doesn't send your code anywhere. A year and a half ago the code analysis was happening in the cloud, but even then a human would not have been able to see the code. &gt;"Kite now performs all processing locally on users' computers, instead of in the cloud. No need to upload your code to our servers. You don't even have to sign up for a Kite account." The official announcement about that was a while back : [Kite Blog](https://kite.com/blog/launching-line-of-code-completions-going-cloudless-and-17-million-in-funding)
I think there are questions then there are questions. We really don’t want a huge wave of beginner questions on here, but I think there is room for more interesting questions. The volume on learnpython is pretty large. I don’t really offer any solutions on how to distinguish these though. I monitor and answer questions on learnpython regularly and tend to find that there are generally three kinds of questions: 1. Beginner questions that are super easy for people to answer. These are either easily googleable, easy to try out on the REPL or they do represent a fundamental misunderstanding from the user that someone has to talk them through. We don’t really want that kind of question here. 2. Complex or advanced questions that may or may not have a solution. Some of these concern the inner workings of python. These would have value being posted here. 3. Domain-specific our operating system based questions that are nominally related to python but aren’t getting answered because no one knows the domain. These are probably the most frustrating for posters as they often don’t know enough to know that their question is a bit inappropriate or they’re just trying learnpython as a last resort. I don’t know if there’s a good way to deal with these. Example: this obscure package that manipulates an obsolete file format isn’t working – you’ld need to know a lot about the package and/or file format to intelligently answer this question.
Shit like this is why I run Linux on my Macbook. I'm very tired of OS updates that fundamentally change how I use MY computer.
That's a great and in-depth summary and matches exactly with what I was thinking. I was kind of dipping a toe in to see how people feel about this right now, but I'll share my idea specifically for dealing with "Help" style posts. If someone posts something and labels it with "help" then I think there should be an automated response that gives an overview on how to structure posts to ask for help: * include your code (not a picture of code) * give an overview of what you have tried * also post to r/learnpython and join the python discord to increase your chance of help * consider stack overflow I think that this may, over time, ease people more towards using some of the other resources, and is a less jarring first experience here.
No problem, glad I could help
Hi (: I'm Aaron. I've written a couple of articles for Kite's blog and we use Owlskip links so that the articles' images and metadata show up correctly when shared, and not for any other purpose. If you've used Owlskip before, it's not a very powerful tool for analytics (GA is better), but it is helpful to keep link appearance up to date. We're also migrating the blog to wordpress so we won't have to do that anymore. &amp;#x200B; I prefer linking directly to [Kite](https://kite.com) (with PyCharm) because it's easier to type (:
u/pythonHelperBot is actually suppose to do that. Though it's a work in progress. Its first version used the stack overflow search engine but I didn't think the results were relevant so I've been working on getting a local copy of SO parsed for a custom search engine. [Here's an early test](https://www.reddit.com/r/pythonforengineers/comments/8nvbf3/untitled/dzzf4xy/) of the SO links. I liked the format but not the results
I would say you're right. It isn't as clear but I can't change the title
One community's (python-discord) experience with these issues, along with Kite developer responses can be seen in [this thread.](https://github.com/python-discord/site/pull/183#issuecomment-491127677) I never used Atom so I can't speak to the minimap issue, but I know it was resolved. It seems that a lot has changed about Kite in the last couple of years.
while on the topic of enforcing things like flair, how about restricting pics in posts like on /r/learnpython to cut down on the low quality content meant for karma farming. &amp;#x200B; I can't think of a single legitimate use for a post that is just a headline and a picture in a forum about things related to programming. If not out right restriction, at least add it to your flair requirement.
python2 ist still bundled but now prints this message every time: &gt; WARNING: Python 2.7 is not recommended. This version is included in macOS for compatibility with legacy software. Future versions of macOS will not include Python 2.7. Instead, it is recommended that you transition to using 'python3' from within Terminal. There is an python3 executable but it requires full Xcode to be installed: &gt; xcode-select: error: tool 'python3' requires Xcode, but active developer directory '/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools' is a command line tools instance Installing Xcode-beta yields a full version of python (including pip and others).
I hope you’re joking.
Try printf.read(-1)
Check section 7.2 of the docs here: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html Also, this is probably better posted to r/learnpython for future reference
I might be in the minority here, but I think this is a bad decision, because what I want out of /r/Python is news and in-depth discussion about Python, not beginner Q&amp;A. I do however, like beginner Q&amp;A being on /r/LearnPython, it's a great dichotomy, because it's easier to search and browse one or the other without having everything lumped together. I will have no way of filtering beginner questions out when browsing on mobile. If 60% of the questions end up being newb / beginner questions, then you've just filtered the original non-newb content of this sub down to 40% of what it was. So if there's a new PEP or some drama in the Python community, I've now got 60% less chance of it hitting the front page. Flairing a post doesn't really solve that issue. Maybe on desktop, but not on mobile. Let me propose a few alternate solutions. These are things that other subreddits already do, and they work really well: 1. Auto-remove the question post, and tell them to post it in a weekly / daily Q&amp;A sticky thread. Everyone is happy. 2. Auto-remove the question post, and tell them to re-post it on a certain day of the week, say, Wednesdays. Everyone is happy. 3. Keep the same behavior you have now (remove and forward them to /r/LearnPython), and do a weekly sticky post featuring decent questions from there (answered and unanswered), and a call for experts to subscribe and answer questions there. Again, everyone is happy.
It's open. What you are printing is the file object. You need to either print(file.read()) or something of the sorts. Check out the documentation for I/O python.
 This should work: f = open(‘file.txt’, ‘r’) print (f.read()) f.close
BTW, I run Arch.
Why not Gentoo?
It shouldn't take two hours to think of googling: https://duckduckgo.com/?q=python+how+to+read+a+file
Well, to be precise, the file did open if you look in the terminal. It just displayed the view of the view of the object (file_name, mode= '-r') So thechnically, only the f.read() part was missing. But learning more is always good
Try: f = open(‘file_that...’, ‘r’) content = f.read() f.close print(content)
Well, I posted that because, on the javascript subreddit, there was this huge post about why javascript was "better" than python, and a lot of people commented things like "I hate python". I don't know about the python community.
&gt; If I say x, d[x] = 4, 8, I'd expect that to be the same as d[x], x = 8, 4. Really? I wouldn't. If I didn't know the language well, I wouldn't even try to predict what would happen when you are both using and updating the same variable in a single statement, not without experimentation and/or careful reading of the documentation. If I did know the language well, I'd apply whichever evaluation rules the language used. And then I'd still test it in the interactive interpreter to make sure I understood the rules correctly.
Got it. Perhaps "hate" wasn't the best way to describe it. Thanks for commenting!
Filtering questions is 1000 times more work though.
Cuz I got burned out building everything from source. Stage1 and Stage2 were all that were available at the time.
That's true, but I haven't found anywhere in the documentation that mentions this behavior. Since everything else is evaluated left to right, I think that's the more intuitive way to do it.
Flair will give the people that aren't interested in helping a way to ignore requests for help. Perfect solution!
[Kite](https://kite.com) was recently released for Linux (: I have it running on my Ubuntu box.
mmmmh, implement NLP for auto removal of "how do I do this" posts? x)
Pycharm and VScode havecfunctionality to work on remote kernel...
The local code analysis does take a good chunk of memory, but that is the trade off for performing analysis locally. I typically use Kite when exploring a new package, as the documentation in the copilot is way faster (and more thorough) for me than the native PyCharm docs shortcut, and the completion suggestions actually do save me some keystrokes.
That's a good place to start. Thank you.
Well, what were you to expect? Note that `file.read` returns a File object, not a str.
Aye. Moderators should act in moderation!
Ugh, I did that and it was not fun
I'll explain my thoughts a bit more. I was a little unclear. As of right now, learn python posts are not allowed. They should be removed. Just like if someone posted a Ruby question. That's not allowed in this sub. So we have all these people who need help with python, all these people who complain about the help posts, and there is an active subreddit dedicated to helping people learn python. The learn python content should not be allowed. The content can easily be separated and everyone wins. (besides mods who have to still moderate). Now there is a python netsec sub. I don't think that requires we can't talk python netsec here though. But let's say 99% of posts were python net sec and we got the same complaints that there's too much netsec. I think it would be reasonable to suggest disallowing that content because there is a sub for it. I guess I'm thinking about separating major and dominating types of content?
I see where you're coming from. My analogy would be i walk into a room that basically says "news about python and no help questions" and as I walk down people are telling me their titles and its so many help questions. I can't not listen :( they aren't supposed to be in there.
Sophia shouldn't be a class, should be an instance of a class named "baby" or "offspring".
For the people who get angry with "help" posts, my question is, what if the people who are learning Python group up and ask advanced users to leave and find a new sub like /r/AdvancedPython? Will we cater to them if that number is reasonably big? I don't think so. &amp;#x200B; We can't simply cater to a single group of people. Just because there is a sub for learning it does not mean we can't do some of that that here. We can encourage the behavior certainly. For any post here, there will be a group of people who don't like that particular post. If we keep removing "help" posts, at the end there will be nobody doing anything. So it's better to coexist. &amp;#x200B; The solution proposed is very reasonable.

When moderators take a post that is not a question but still delete it and point the author at r/learnpython because it is not "news" then you have more pressing problems. You need to ***get your rules sorted out and stick to them.*** The groups rules do not mention news at all! &amp;#x200B; r/Python rules at time of posting: &gt; 1.belongs in /r/learnpython &gt; &gt;If you are about to ask a question about how to do something in python, please check out [/r/learnpython](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython). It is a very helpful community that is focused on helping people get answers that they understand. &gt; &gt;2.not related to Python programming language &gt; &gt;Please use other subreddits for things that are more generally programmer related, or for things that involve large snakes. &amp;#x200B; Moderators: act in moderation!
This comment deserves a trophy. But I think its reasonable to for this class to inherit from some gene class given that there's probably more common methods involving gene attributes rather than mammals. Mammals are incredibly varied after all and assuming that you only care about instantiating humans and not cats and dogs and such, it's a lot more efficient to just inherit attributes related to human genes and not attributes appropriate for an entire clade with as much variety as mammalia.
yes, yes, yes. Programmers of reddit, please heed what sounds like a very well thought-out and empathetic plan from someone that is looking to save thousands of hours in mod-time and user frustration
Classes are not meant to be data storage. You don't agree? Well, ok, let's say you store the genetic data in an attribute called "genedata". Now your "child" class inherits the mom class and then the dad class. Tough shit, your inheritance just overwrote the genes of the mom in child class and now it has exactly the same genes as the dad. You can solve the "too broad to handle" with deeper inheritance. A creature is an instance of a class, let's say HomoSapiens which inherits Homo which inherits Hominini which inherits Homininae which inherits Hominidae which inherits Simiiformes which inherits Haplorhini which inherits Primates which inherits Mammalia which inherits Chordata which inherits Animalia. "A dog and a monkey can move their tail, but a human cannot, how to have common methods for them?" you could use interfaces, abstraction and even deeper inheritance.
Yea... That doesn't really happen here :x
I like it. But maybe have the bot detect likely questions and then propose flair to those people? Keep updating the question filter to catch the ones that make it throigh the next time. I'd rather the option and not be bothered about it, unless I ask a question and forget the mandatory question flair. Then interject.
If beginner questions are allowed you end up with a "give a mouse a cookie" situation. Someone asking extremely beginner questions here, without reading the sidebar or even seeing out a sub like /r/learnpython, will not stop at one question. They'll be back an hour or a day later with another extremely basic question. Other users will see the pattern and spam their own simplistic and easily answered with a cursory search questions and then the sub is overrun and no discussion will happen. It doesn't matter if such posts are auto-flaired or whatever, the noise floor of the sub will increase substantially. That's not that the sub suffers no questions, if you come along asking for help with say a TensorFlow problem that's not likely to be fodder for /r/learnpython. Such a question should be welcomed here. It's usually pretty easy to tell the difference between "how tenserflow?!" and an actual question. The former is unwelcome and should not be encouraged.
Which means that in order to get a banana you have to import the whole jungle. That's the definition of inefficiency. Inheritance in this scenario should work where genetic data is stored as loci, and each loci is an attribute belonging to the human class. When a human instance inherits from two other human instances, they get a random assortment of loci to create a full complement of loci. Kind of like how it works IRL.
People should be reading side bars. But newcomers are inclined to just see "/r/python" as "The Python Community of Reddit" without the nuanced goals of this specific subreddit reflected in the name. Maybe the name shouldn't be this broad. /r/pythonnews seems to be a more appropriate name for what the rules of this reddit imply. Remember who is asking questions: young people setting out in the early days of their careers or older python novices who are adapting to new technology as their careers demand. They're generally confused, inexperienced, and need help. Many times they haven't been parts of communities before and are passers-by or people who haven't had the "internet ediquette" chat yet. Those people are really the heart and purpose of these communities. When new people are turned away or see the community as hostile, they may decide not to come back. It doesn't feel good. Why would want to join a community that salty and anal? That's what kills communities and projects. Nobody likes a curmudgeon, no matter how correct they are. I'm just recommending empathy over rules.
I would agree if flair filtering worked on mobile, but since it doesn't I would probably end up unsubscribing. I mainly like this place as a discussion about releases, the conferences, and other news. I realize that's somewhat finely tuned, but I'd rather have a quiet sub than a spammy one. The next tier that we currently allow are the informative posts and the show and tell posts. I'd prefer we do away with show and tell since most end up being basic and only cool because it's someone they're pretty young. I'd love to see this content for more advanced stuff but that's hard to regulate. This is the same argument for informative posts - I think a lot are way too basic and are really just links to blog posts by the author for views. I'd love to see more advanced topics this way, but again there are varying interpretations of advanced.
Not whole jungle. You don't have all the data in Mammal class, only those attributes and methods that cannot be moved up (appears in worthless places) or down (redundancy) in hierarchy. As far as I know, there is no reasonable non-hacky way to interfere with inheritance in python. And I don't see why there should be. And I don't see why one would use classes as data storage. And I don't see why one would want to use classes as instances.
Almost agree, but I've been an absolute beginner too. &amp;#x200B; Let's be completely honest here; A beginner is going to go through hell given forum rules and community attitude. &amp;#x200B; Q: "How do I do this?" &amp;#x200B; A1: "That's been asked before." &amp;#x200B; A2: "Use this niche fix that works for a problem I'm having or have recently had, but has nothing to do with your question." &amp;#x200B; A3: "MODS" &amp;#x200B; A4: (\*subtly harasses individual and suggests their incompetence) &amp;#x200B; A5: "What are you even trying to do?" &amp;#x200B; A6: "I remember when I....(bullshit)" &amp;#x200B; A7: "This is your issue. This is why it's happening. This is how to fix it." &amp;#x200B; A8: "You don't need to explain your code to me, I know how to read code" (Usually said by someone struggling to understand the code) &amp;#x200B; A9: "If you completely change the structure of your project, you could use this library!" &amp;#x200B; A10: "I can't believe you use...(bullshit)."
&gt;Those people are really the heart and purpose of these communities. "think of the children" &amp;#x200B; so if every community has to cater to the children, then there will be no place where adults can talk.

Wooot?
it's really hard to find the type 2 questions because of the flood of 1 and 3 and the shit posts of "look at this pile of books" or "my tattoo" or "my needle point" or "my baby's onesy with python code on it" those get upvoted to oblivion and bury the good stuff, like in recent memory someone asking about why something like clojure's ring isn't implemented in python. (turns out we all learn that ring and ruby's rack were inspired by wsgi, and the OP just needed to know about wsgi) or another one about dependency injection or design patterns etc.. that's the interesting beneficial content, not the questions or the karma farming shit posts. &amp;#x200B; also the "whyru using 2?" post are just another stealthy version of the karma farming shit post category.
&gt;For the people who get angry with "help" posts, my question is, what if the people who are learning Python group up and ask advanced users to leave and find a new sub like i was here first, I followed the rules of the sub as expected why should I leave bc lazy millenials would rather use reddit to do their google searching for them?
Why would they then? Just because you were here first doesn't give you any right for preferential treatment.
&gt;subreddit Got it - thanks for letting me know.
expecting community rules to be followed == preferential treatment lol
No. Following rules is not preferential treatment. You are claiming because you were here first, you should have a say on how the sub should run. That's where you are claiming preferential treatment. &amp;#x200B; And community rules are not set in stone. Just because some "advanced" users got angry, the mods added the learn python rule. Tomorrow the "learners" can raise enough vote to kick you out because you are "advanced" user. Whether you were here before or not doesn't matter.
I feel like, as a moderator and user of python, it has to be disheartening to take down questions of people trying to learn what you love, for that alone I would go for your proposition. But as GP said, the number of school assignments I've seen in other subs (/r/bash) is really really high.
Not really. Do you have to have a whole private space? Why not just have some discussions on higher level subjects and some at lower level? I feel that threads are properly isolated. I don't see why we need entire subreddits for different levels of discussion. I'll just subscribe to all of them and view them in a multi-reddit anyway. But that's me. As an amateur, I learned much from watching experienced people argue over minutia. Seeing what vehement opponents agree upon was extremely educational. Exposure to new terms, techniques, technologies, etc, was very useful. And I also learned a hell of a lot trying to answer questions and teach while trying to be as accurate and clear as possible. High and low level discussions were equally valuable to me. It's obviously a personal preference. If others prefer /r/python narrowly scoped to basically only non-self posts, so be it. I'll just read /r/python+learnpython for my jollies anyway.
Use [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/). It's the most pain free way of parsing html (although navigating html programmatically will always be a bit painful).
Filtering out posts is trivially easy if they're flaired, on just about every platform. Set your filters to ignore "help" posts, and all the mice that were given cookies are just filtered from your existence completely.
Several people have already given the answer, so I thought I'd provide something else: &amp;#x200B; In your terminal, start your Python command line (type `python`) Try the following commands: `help(open)` `f = open('myfile.txt')` `help(f)` `dir(f)` `help(`[`f.read`](https://f.read)`)` These commands will generate a lot of text and perhaps it's too much info, but try browsing through it. Really, the point I'm trying to make is: * `help()` can be called on most objects in Python to get useful documentation on that object ("object" includes functions and methods, because this is Python!) * `dir()` can be called on most objects to quickly list a menu of their associated methods and attributes * These functions work *quickly* whether or not you have internet access (meaning sometimes they might be better than Google) I hate reading docs just as much as the next guy, but based on OP's subject line it sounds like 15 minutes of reading would have saved a ton of time in the long run. A professional developer is really just a professional documentation reader in some cases. Cheers!
this would deff be possible in python but i would think node or django would be a better route. the only way i could think of doing it would be to use the python Flask module an have ur form post the data to ur flask endpoint then process the data it gets and return a dynamic html page of sorts with what ur wanting to display to the end user.
I think this is true in any subreddit with moderate to large number of users (in fact true of internet in general). The "quality" stuff doesn't always get more upvotes and we do not have a automatic sorting system that is powerful enough to sort questions based on quality (which is highly subjective btw). I think what is important is to minimize the barrier for people to post and engage in discussion. If there are too many hoops to go through they won't bother and post somewhere else. It may take some effort to manually filter out the bad stuff when one is browsing through but it is worth the effort when you find something truly interesting.
Sorry, but it seems that you asked for the opinion of the community and you are simply not listening to those that displease you, but rather trying to argue with them.
Providing a counter example is not just "not listening".

Show /r/learnpython the code you have tried and describe where you are stuck. **[Be sure to format your code for reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/faq#wiki_how_do_i_format_code.3F)** and include which version of python and what OS you are using.

Now make one with a Z axis
Speaking with no real knowledge, I suspect they aren't up to anything. From other posts on reddit, it seems like the bash to ZSH thing is because of the bash license (though there is debate as to whether that is *actually* the issue). And this may just be about the fact that python2 is deprecated (or will be) and they didn't want to ship python3. I will say that it bums me out a bit. While there is no real restriction from installing it yourself, it makes macOS feel even further separated from the rest of the \*nix world where you *can* assume there is at least some form of python (even if it is 2.6)
Putting all the technical stuff to one side, thank you for spending your time being an unpaid and under appreciated mod.
&gt; Please let me know what you think in the comments. I really do understand your point, but I don't think it's coherent in this given context.
You're welcome!
Personally I think if everyone wants to keep questions out of this sub, they need to make a commitment to going to learnpython and answering some questions regularly, make it a place people want to post questions to. But what do I know, I'm just learning.
I see a way to solve your issue with the flood of beginner questions without doing away with flair entirely. We could make distinct flairs for beginner, intermediate, or advanced level questions. As far as I know flair can be amended later, if a post not categorized correctly at first. And if I understand everything correctly, and people aren't intentionally mis-flairing their posts, there wouldn't be much more or less work for anybody involved, it would provide question askers with different levels of answerer knowledge and a larger userbase, and it would provide lurkers and answerers with a way of finding questions of a skill level they are most interested in helping. &amp;#x200B; If this weren't implemented here, it may even work in r/learnpython. &amp;#x200B; What do you think?
Just some quick tips, looking into the random module and the time module, with random you can spawn a random type of fish from a list of defined types and then do time.sleep(5) until you spawn the next one. On mobile so good luck man!
I am certainly open to a middle-ground solution (thought I'm not necessarily back tracking on what I've proposed, just exploring other options). I strongly feel that the flair solution is going to be a part of this moving forward - do we have agreement there? I'd like to challenge you *a bit* based on what you've said. Since someone else just accused me of not listening, I want to be clear that I've read what you've written, but I think differently. I want to be clear that a number of the concerns that you've raised are concerns that I also have, though we don't match up exactly. &gt; I will have no way of filtering beginner questions out when browsing on mobile. How are you browsing on mobile? There are certainly some filtering options available to mobile users, so if we can narrow down places where there's just no option to use filters, that would be helpful for me. &gt; If 60% of the questions end up being newb / beginner questions There is a significant amount of help questions already - they often exist for a space of hours or even days if I'm on vacation or otherwise unavailable - and they do not tend to get upvoted because, to be honest, they're not particularly interesting. &gt; ... you've just filtered the original non-newb content of this sub down to 40% of what it was ... I've now got 60% less chance of it hitting the front page. I don't think this math actually works out. PEP news *consistently* does very well here because it's almost universally relevant, so the upvote ratio is quite high. Help posts, conversely, do not do well. They are almost always downvoted. Personally, I tend to think that this means that they are a non-issue for most people, because they don't make it to the front page of r/python or to people's personal reddit front page. I think that this rule will actually have very little effect on the subreddit if we approach it right, and it will make the subreddit feel a lot more welcoming to people. I also want to say that if we do adopt this rule, and if your fear does come to pass, I'm certainly open to amending anything we've done (as I hope that this post shows). I think some of your middle ground solutions are interesting. &gt; post it in a weekly / daily Q&amp;A sticky thread / re-post it on a certain day of the week, This has the same sort of problem as the current solution, which is that it leaves a fundamental bad taste for people on their first visit, and it also has an additional overhead of taking up a sticky spot or requiring more bots to work. Interestingly, they could work in conjunction with each other, but that might get complicated. &gt; do a weekly sticky post featuring decent questions from there (answered and unanswered), and a call for experts to subscribe and answer questions there While I think this is a delightful suggestion, I don't think anyone is going to spend the time to compile a list of good questions from r/learnpython. A new moderator or two might be interested in doing that, but I imagine that in about a month, this would be a chore that the person would hate doing. I understand that this is a crappy reason to dismiss a suggestion, but workflow is an important consideration. &gt; allow the poster to re-submit or un-remove if they can point to an unanswered thread That's another good solution, and relatively easy to make work. Great comment, thanks for the alternate points of view. I'm definitely going to be considering this when we figure out next steps.

There would **certainly** be a trial period to see if this would work. I also think that we might restrict help posts in September or January, when students are just starting out.
When you say "doesn't work on mobile" what do you mean precisely? Many mobile ways to access reddit support flair filtering.
Flair is a separate issue, and may be worthwhile even if the treatment of Learning Posts doesn't change. You might want to change the title, set up a poll, or make a new dedicated post to get feedback on that specific change. Now, people like to be nice to beginners, StackOverflow shows this to be undeniably true. But there is a limit and that must be honestly addressed. * Would you feel the same with a 4x increase in the number of "how do I" posts? * Would you feel the same after the same damn question is asked and answered a dozen times? * Would you feel the same after the same damn question is asked and answered a mere two posts earlier? * Would you feel the same when the quality of the questions drops significantly? * Would you feel the same when the people asking the question become more belligerent as getting answers here, not being explicitly against the rules, becomes a "right"? * The quality of the answers might be deemed as higher here, compared to r/learnpython, but that is only because there are so few. * People didn't sign up to this sub to get distracted by beginner questions. * Being able to filter is not a panacea; that same argument could be used to justify having Ruby questions answered here. * Filtering is friction, and you shouldn't underestimate the razor-thin margin sub-reddits have in the market for readers attention. (The current popularity of the sub is as much a testament to the current quality of mod oversight, as the subject matter itself.) * The people most likely to abandon the sub due to the additional friction are least likely to engage with you on this topic. * It is easier to use a different sub-reddit than to use a filter.
Yeah, if you’re using the preinstalled version in a development environment, hoo boy your life is far more difficult than it should be.
I work remotely full time as a Python engineer for a company that makes a browser that may have a fox. 😀
TL;DR - Do OP's solution, but on r/learnpython and enforce a better structure (like formatting). I am also fully in support of any change we make and would be happy to lend a hand in this regard. &amp;#x200B; As a lurker on r/matlab with infrequent contributions, I have a couple issues with a flair system. OP is spot on with the problems of asking questions on both r/Python and r/learnpython. The way I see it, asking for programming help on Reddit should be somewhere between what it is now, and how it is done on StackOverflow. That is, the informal nature should remain, but there needs to be some structure that everyone needs to adhere to. Now, on the topic of r/matlab. The flair system actually does a good job of identifying and separating questions from the other content. However, r/matlab is choked with questions that are: \- copy/paste formatting garbage \- homework questions that expect a full answer to copy/paste \- made by throwaway accounts/first time posters &lt;- this is a whole rant that boils down to 'I have &lt;copy/paste code&gt; solve it for me. BTW I won't thank you or inform you or anything' [Here is my most recent experience on r/matlab](https://www.reddit.com/r/matlab/comments/bw1rg1/translate_matlab_code_to_python/) (Note that I gave the full answers to the question a couple hour after my initial reply). My belief is that if we start supporting questions on r/Python, we are going to end up with problems that r/matlab displays. That said, OP's idea is one that will work with a healthy amount of moderation (good formatting/ clear question/enforce flairs). This is not to say that this moderation is restricted to moderators, we regular users can also enforce this. My adaptation of OP's solution would be to do all this on r/learnpython. We should also encourage more people to join and contribute as well. As someone that likes to constantly learn and teach, I am guilty of not contributing to r/learnpython which is something I am going to rectify. I would be happy to help with any changes we make, it is important that we don't let this just become a discussion.
&gt; strongly feel that the flair solution is going to be a part of this moving forward - do we have agreement there? Sure, the more flairs, the better. Just don't forget to throw something into the sidebar that links to the filter-by-flair search page. I believe that mechmarket and r/homelabsales have these in the sidebar. &gt; How are you browsing on mobile? There are certainly some filtering options available to mobile users, so if we can narrow down places where there's just no option to use filters, that would be helpful for me. Narwhal for iPhone. I've no idea how to casually filter a subreddit by default. &gt; There is a significant amount of help questions already - they often exist for a space of hours or even days if I'm on vacation or otherwise unavailable - and they do not tend to get upvoted because, to be honest, they're not particularly interesting. You've got a point there, because reddit's algorithm (usually) won't put something on the front page if it's not upvoted. So to your point, the so-called cream should still rise to the top (Python news, drama, etc) as it currently does &gt; PEP news consistently does very well here because it's almost universally relevant, so the upvote ratio is quite high. Help posts, conversely, do not do well. Yes, I concede that. You're right. &gt; &gt; post it in a weekly / daily Q&amp;A sticky thread / re-post it on a certain day of the week, &gt; This has the same sort of problem as the current solution, which is that it leaves a fundamental bad taste for people on their first visit, Part of that is probably just down to the tone in which you're setting in the automod message to them. If you're doing it in a constructive and re-assuring manner, it's on them if they're feeling offended by it. &gt; and it also has an additional overhead of taking up a sticky spot or requiring more bots to work. That's a decision that most of my favorite subreddits have chosen to enact, and it's worked well to my knowledge. A few examples: - r/headphones - would be a nightmare without it! They run 2 stickys: purchase advice, and a general discussion thread - r/MechanicalKeyboards - same story, it funnels in the "what kind of keyboard should I buy" threads into one easy-to-navigate thread - r/mechmarket/ - They run a monthly price-check thread as a sticky, as well as a confirmed-trade thread. Would be chaos without these. - r/diysound - a smaller sub, the sticky threads still works well - r/homelab - They run a general discussion thread - r/homelabsales - They run a confirmed trades thread - r/amateurradio/ - They're throwing in all the "I just got my amateur radio license" posts into a single thread, which I really like. Those are just the ones off the top of my head, but there are more. All of those communities above are run really well by mods that aren't much different than you and the others on this subreddit. And just to clarify my original comment, I don't think any of us are going to be mad if you're trying things, throwing stuff on the wall to see what sticks. You can always change it and mix it up until you find a better solution. I've unsubbed from a lot of subreddits recently, but r/Python won't be one of them. It's a great subreddit and the mod team is definitely part of making it that way. Keep up the good work.
I like categorization. I want to be open and welcoming, but I think kindly directing “help me” posts to r/learnpython would be more helpful to everyone involved.

I mean. You don’t..have to update. CentOS 8 is removing Python altogether and you’ll be forced to pick with version you want. Also, on Mac there is brew if you really want python2
Here are presentations from the PyCon and PyData conferences; there are a lot so you will need to narrow them down with keyword filtering, or browse by author. [https://pyvideo.org/](https://pyvideo.org/)
Thanks for the reply :) I’ll look into this as 99% of what you’re saying is foreign. But it puts me on a path, nonetheless.
np! if u need any help dm me here on reddit always happy to help :)
GP answer is great and I'd like to toss in my $0.02, with the caveat that I don't browse this sub much or /r/LearnPython at all and have 0 actual data backing up what I'm about to say. I've seen other subs where an often posted to the point of being spammy concept, including "help" posts, gets moved to another sub and what ends up happening is the demographic of people who frequent the more specific sub significantly leans towards those who make the content that belongs there and thus lose the diversity that made the parent sub useful to begin with. So like you have I dunno 60% new people, 20% getting the ropes, 20% knowledged. Vs the main sub which is 20% new people, 40% getting the ropes, 40% knowledged. Thus you have people who feel "even when things are removed here, they get better answers" because the average experience of eyeballs landing on their question is higher. And similarly, you've got reddit ranking subs through magic on your feed and I feel like the bigger ones (with posts that necessarily get more votes) definitely get more weight so unless you're specifically going to the child subs you probably won't see posts there just casually lurking your main feed. All that's to say I think flairing posts here is a great idea for the community so newcomers don't feel pushed out to a wasteland of other newcomers asking questions none of them know how to solve. And then directing them to SO and discord is a great idea. Thank you for being a good mod here! Trying to do what's best for everyone. I hope it works out well for you too!
/r/learnpython mod here. &gt; I've been told that people frequently feel like they do not get answers on r/LearnPython I am surprised to hear that. Most questions on /r/learnpython are answered within a few minutes. Admittedly /r/learnpython is lacking in high-level answers. With a few very appreciated exceptions, most of the people answering questions are themselves learners or hobby coders. However for the vast majority of questions this is more than enough and the OP gets a good answer fast. Maybe change the language to "ask on /r/learnpython *first*" to give people the option to come back to the experts here if /r/learnpython fails.
It definitely is much cleaner to use `dict.get`. However, keep in mind if you are trying to optimize performance, it's 3-4x slower than `if key in dict`.
A yes, I should be inconvenienced because other people can't follow an extremely simple social contract. Don't bother asking the sub for opinions if you're going to ignore them because you've got The Solution.
Hey thank you...do u have any suggestions on how I would be able to go back and forth between links and scraping everything in order or at least in a organized way?
I have an i7 in a laptop. It's good for a few minutes and then thermal throttles to shit. Make sure you take this into consideration for all processors. The laptop must have sufficient cooling (and OEMs lie).
&gt;it makes macOS feel even further separated from the rest of the *nix world where you can assume there is at least some form of python Feels like this has been changing in general across the industry in the last 5 years or so. Pretty much every modern development technique makes it clear that you shouldn't assume ANYTHING and always be explicit about what you are using. I agree with it. If you need Python 2.6, then install and explicitly use python 2.6. Just running "python" might have worked for the last 10 years, but it won't in the future - build things to survive that.
Probably best to start by scraping the link in you posted in number 1 and storing the name of the antibiotic with a value of its URL. Then you can iterate over that and have BeatifulSoup scrape the necessary 'spectrum' information from each page and write it to a file. This is definitely a tricky one, especially since you'll have to toggle each of the expandables to see all of the antibiotics (doesn't seem like they're present on pageload as each click on an expandable sends an XHR request that retrieves the data then generates the dropdown)
For me, the flair-based filter settings do not persist for some reason. I don't come for a day and find them being reset.
Happen to know if get() is faster than the non-pythonic if block in the example?
I have recently deleted my account on Stack Exchange. Because whenever I do really have an IT question, it is immediately marked offtopic on all its subforums. SE is only good when you are too lasy to browse the documentation.
I agree. The subreddit name is the most generic it could be. Which is why there is no escape from this. It will never end because people do not read the description or the rules. I disagree that it's hostile or the community will die. It's as if people were posting Ruby questions and we wanted it removed, then we are called hostile. That content does not belong here. It's in the wrong place. Now because it's a Python question, it appears hostile, but that content is not allowed so it's not hostile. They're posting jn the wrong sub and they just don't realize it.
I was going to suggesst the weekly sticky thread idea as well since it seems to be the most elegant way to make everyone happy. Subsribers who don't want to be flooded with python beginner questions won't see new posts popping up daily on the subreddit and those who still want to post their questions here, whether because they don't know where else to go or feel they can get better feedback from this subreddit have a place to post them.
waiting for python 3, i wish it should be an easy installation by just doing pip install kivy,
There’s another very important property of deques (double linked lists), and that’s appending left/popping left is as fast as appending (right)/popping (right). Specifically, both are O(1) operations, whereas appending/popping left in a list is an O(n) operation. This doesn’t have any implications for a LIFO stack listed here, but it absolutely does if you want to do a FIFO queue. import time from collections import deque loop_num = 100000 list_ = [] t0 = time.clock() for i in range(loop_num): list_.insert(0,i) for i in range(loop_num): list_.pop(0) print(f'list: {time.clock() - t0}') deque_ = deque() t0 = time.clock() for i in range(loop_num): deque_.appendleft(i) for i in range(loop_num): deque_.popleft() print(f'deque: {time.clock() - t0}') list: 4.149204999999995 deque: 0.016936999999998648
Also a huge fan of categories and allowing general learning posts. I had a post that was removed due to "learning" but what I really wanted was discussion around possibilities from other advanced users. LearnPython didn't seem like the right fit, a question like that would be closed immediately on SO. So if I have general python philosophical questions I'm not sure where to go and /r/python seems like a natural choice.
I've been working the last 12 years remote. I actually started working remote because I couldn't find python work locally at the time (everything was Java and C++). If you've already worked in python and machine learning then finding a remote job in python and machine learning shouldn't be any different. Have a look at r/remotepython , have a look at [virtualvocations.com](https://virtualvocations.com). [dice.com](https://dice.com) also lets you filter job searches for telecommute. On machine learning, I've not seen as many openings for remote positions as typical software engineering positions. So, that might be a little tougher. I hope this helps.
I’m a learner, a total beginner. I just want to say that I haven’t posted in r/python before because I have seen that r/learnpython exists. I read r/python simply to get an idea of what is possible. One thing that might be missing - and this applies to R or C# or any other language - is the lack of skills in googling because noobs might not even know how to phrase their questions. Stack Overflow is intimidating at first. I speak from experience. I won’t post a python question on this sub because I don’t want to bother people. Folk finding this sub first and asking a newbie question should be kindly and with love be asked to post to r/learnpython but still have recourse to this sub if they don’t get an answer. Thanks to all the mods who look after all our communities. Except for the mods of r/funny. Fuck them.
More like `raise NotImplementedError()`.
People want the separation because they aren't interested in the help posts. It's the same questions every day. They are clutter and in the way. And your solution creates a win a win, people subscribe to the content they want. They create a multireddit. It allows people to only read what they are interested in. Now we have a practicality problem, people don't read the rules or don't care so the mods can't moderate it and keep up with the content.
```python name = input("what iz ur nme:") if name == "zach": print("fbi is watching you") else: print("Keep up the good work") ```
Use beautifulsoups find_all to find all the links you need, then iterate over them in a for loop, do a request for each link and extract the information using beautifulsoup again and store it in whatever data structure suites.
that was exactly what I was thinking of! to be a bit more general, the method he used was called constraint satisfaction
What if an additional subreddit was created? Maybe something like r/intermediatepython? I have also found learn python to be less than helpful to the intermediate to advanced level questions. Maybe a place where more advanced explanation occurs.
Look into https://github.com/eliben/pycparser There are some code generation examples. Here's a basic example to extract the names as you mentioned: from pycparser import c_parser, c_ast c_header = ''' struct address { char name[50]; char street[100]; char city[50]; char state[20]; int pin; }; ''' class VarVisitor(c_ast.NodeVisitor): def visit_TypeDecl(self, node): print(node.declname, ':', *node.type.names) parser = c_parser.CParser() ast = parser.parse(c_header) visitor = VarVisitor() visitor.visit(ast) The output for this is: name : char street : char city : char state : char pin : int
heaven compared to the hell of mailing lists in late 90's.
MIT intro to python do that before even thinking about anything else . I used to spend so much time looking for resource instead of picking one doing it because looking for resources is easier and gives you that satisfaction of “commitment”
Honestly I don't like this idea. Going to a website and clicking on "download" is not that much of a pain, especially when you know what version you want and how to install it. I never liked that Python (2) came with MacBooks, it caused more headaches than it solved, now Apple is going to stop but Microsoft starts?
The source states it will be Python 3.7, which seems fine to me.
You should charge membership fees for r/Python by requiring weekly duty at r/learnpython
Thanks a lot man. Will do. I have completed intro to python: absolute beginner and currently studying intro to python: fundamentals. Both courses are by Microsoft on eDX. Do you think the MIT course will add something valuable to whatever i’ve learned from these courses ? Also, at what stage are you right now in learning python ? And how much time did you take to reach that level of expertise ?
i guess he's looking ahead? assuming microsoft continues including python 3.7 in the far future when we start using python 4+, ends up being like apple with python 2
I can understand that but what's the harm in removing some more barrier to entry?
There are not 3D examples yet in the official docs, but 3D games are perfectly doable. You can check out this classic example: [https://github.com/fogleman/Minecraft](https://github.com/fogleman/Minecraft) After poking around with that, maybe drop by the Discord channel if you need help understanding something in the codebase: [https://discord.gg/QXyegWe](https://discord.gg/QXyegWe) &amp;#x200B; The upcoming pyglet 1.4 release as rudimentary support for loading wavefront 3D modules (obj). The next release after that (2.0) is a bigger one, as pyglet's core is being migrated to GL3+. That release will also get a glTF model loader, since it will finally have the capability to handle the material types, and PBR, etc.
I am just happy, because the computers at my school are completely locked down. I can't install or use Python at school because of this, unless I use an online IDE that I can't use modules on. I would boot into Ubuntu, but we are not allowed to bring any sort of external storage or even a USB mouse.
I just read this article on Linux Weekly News and wanted to share it. Very interesting to see what's possible to do with very little programming and very cheap hardware thanks to Python (in this case, MicroPython, actually). For those who prefer, [the keynote is available on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35mXD40SvXM) and the slides are on [Speaker Deck](https://speakerdeck.com/nnja/preso-c22944f3-ce78-4ced-8a34-f866656bf6c8).
It looks like some other advanced python or python news subreddit will have to be created.
fair point but do school computers ever get updated? i see some of mine are still running windows 7 lol
Most Linux distros come with Python preinstalled. It’s nice, like not having to worry about having a simple compiler for C/C++
I'm at a STEM school, so we are lucky enough to have newer thinkpads with Windows 10.
Ok. But what language was the assistantBOT written in?
sweet
For my own use: On the one hand, flair doesn't seem useful to me because I rarely visit /r/Python specifically, I see posts as part of my frontpage or a ~~multireddit~~ custom feed. On the other hand, I'm subbed to both this and /r/LearnPython anyway, so I'm not really fussed about filtering.
"who are learning Python group up and ask advanced users to leave and find a new sub like /r/AdvancedPython? Will we cater to them if that number is reasonably big?". I think that's happening right now and will probably happen. The learn python posts have overrun the subreddit and the mods can't keep up. It's probably time for a new subreddit for advanced users or just news or something. " We can't simply cater to a single group of people.". Subreddits have rules so we it's absolutely possible, technically. We now have a problem of practicality. People don't read the rules or just don't care and the mods can't keep up. And it's not elitism. It's people looking for specific content and trying to avoid other content, but not able to because the rules of the subreddit aren't followed. They're annoyed.
Or will they update it to the newest version every windows update and break your programs? Or what if you still want 3.6 and the Windows-installed 3.7 conflicts in unexpected ways? Generally I'm just in favour of packaging as little as possible with an OS, or with a new computer, and let users do what works for them, and if people aren't computer savvy enough to do that then they won't be coding anyways. I'd be happy if they provide some option not to include it, but I doubt it as Windows has been moving more and more towards controlling what you have on your computer and how it operates.
Yeah, the bloatware that comes with Windows 10 is pretty bad. I guess I agree if it was optional.
Was looking for multiple inheritance comment. Found the multiple inheritance comment. Left satisfied. Thank you sir.
As a matter of fact I am perfectly fine with this plan. Even though it may cause some issues, such as l programs designed for Windows being stuck on the only Python version that Microsoft decides to support. Which could theoretically and also actually hurt the further development of Python. However, the benefits are huge. The Python code will work on all future windows machines, elevating Python penetration to never before seen levels, which will increase demand for Python among youth. As long as Microsoft csn come up with a way of supporting multiple versions of Python this is a good plan.
I would advise getting a little familiar with HTML syntax first.
Funny, Apple just announced they will stop including scripting frameworks, like Python and Ruby because they don't want to update and maintain them.
 Including python is really good. It means you can share python scripts to non-techies without having to compile it or telling them to download Python.
Love it
&gt; JS being difficult to troubleshoot. which is mostly due to js programmers not really knowing how to program in the large. I have seen systems written around multiple things reading and writing from the same local storage or cookies etc which would have the same problems as using global variables. Throw in async operations and you just have a fucking mess that no one, not even the original author could reason about. &amp;#x200B; The language supports good design decisions, js programmers just dont seem to be making them.
Yes, That course accompanies a book from same authors. The course is very good intro to CS as a whole. That class is the first CS class CS majors take there too
Steve Dower who is a core dev working at Microsoft led this I believe, so hopefully it won’t cause any headaches. He mentioned it a few months ago on the Talk Python to Me podcast.
As long as Windows doesn't start relying on it. Python on Linux: Mess with the packages without using a Virtualenv, and break the OS.
Yeah I can see that value in it
Out of curiosity, have you tried [pyodide](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2019/04/pyodide-bringing-the-scientific-python-stack-to-the-browser/)?
Could I see your code? Do you have a GitHub?
I don't think your down votes are warranted. You're right. The rules can change and the mods clearly want to change them. An advanced sub or news sub can be created and everyone will win.
I get what you're saying but the mods can't keep up.
Hello! I'm a bot! It looks to me like your post might be better suited for r/learnpython, a sub geared towards questions and learning more about python. That said, I am a bot and it is hard to tell. Please follow the subs rules and guidelines when you do post there, it'll help you get better answers faster. Show /r/learnpython the code you have tried and describe where you are stuck. **[Be sure to format your code for reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/faq#wiki_how_do_i_format_code.3F)** and include which version of python and what OS you are using. You can also ask this question in the [Python discord](https://discord.gg/3Abzge7), a large, friendly community focused around the Python programming language, open to those who wish to learn the language or improve their skills, as well as those looking to help others. *** [^(README)](https://github.com/CrakeNotSnowman/redditPythonHelper) ^(|) [^(FAQ)](https://github.com/CrakeNotSnowman/redditPythonHelper/blob/master/FAQ.md) ^(|) ^(this bot is written and managed by /u/IAmKindOfCreative) ^(This bot is currently under development and experiencing changes to improve its usefulness)
What I read was “python” will invoke python 2.7 and “python3” will invoke python 3.7. And I thought why continue this python3 thing.... Python should be the new python3
It's ok, I help. I down vote shit I don't think belongs here, and sometimes I'll put the proverbial /r/learnpython And sometimes I'll answer the question in /r/python or /r/learnpython if I'm feeling nice that day. It takes a village...
Personally this might be nice for me for OS bootstrap automation for driver testing. But this is going to get hairy in 5-10 years. Apple made the right move. Anyone interested in scripting should be able to find the need version and run the installer. An inbox native package manager on the other hand would be nice... “nuget install python37 vscode”
I have found this to be of great help. Thank you so much.
Thank you so much. This has been of great help to me to learn the basics.
What's actually there is a small stub that launches into the app store to install Python. That installation in the app store is controlled by the core Python developers too, do it'll get updated to the latest version regularly. Steve Dower gave a talk about it at PyCon and I believe also mentioned it at the language summit there. So a lot of the concerns mentioned in the comments here should be mitigated.
Not at all a Windows user, but isn't this problem virtualenvs aim to solve? I have a few projects using 2.7, 3.4 and 3.7 all running in their own envs on both my Mac and Linux machines.
It seems to be a lot of pain for most users. Python on Android never got going because of this.
I think his point is that devs will target the version specifically running on Windows machines and fall behind in newer updates
Python on most GNU/Linux distros are recent enough for most admistrative task, and that's what it's there for. If you're not happy with the version, use virtualenv and stop whining.
&gt; STEM school &gt; thinkpads with Windows 10. what a waste
The article is actually very misleading to the point the are trying to be deceitful. &gt; you can get your Windows 10 installation updated to the latest version and use Python without having to **download from Python.org**. Python will _not_ be included in Windows by default. You still have to download them. PSF is going to start distributing Python via the Microsoft Store and Microsoft is putting in placeholder binaries for `python` and `python3` that opens up the storage page to the latest Python install on the store page. Each version of Python will be a standalone installation, similar to how versions of Ubuntu are standalone installations for WSL.
This is great.
I suppose that's a fair point. I'd imagine a big part fo why 2.7 is still around is because it's what everyone ships with.
The hashtags and @ mentions in the blog title gave me dysentery.
I’m afraid even this move won’t save Windows.. you know, they also tried to include Ubuntu and other distros. Unfortunately I see this as an attempt of the Windows OS to piggy-back on something popular (time and again). Python rocks in part because it’s platform independent. And the community (which by the was also in part uses Windows) will not make a change in spirit just because Windows includes it. At least that’s my hope. Sorry for all that rant. You may release your tomatoes and eggs now :-D
They are too busy with their new display stand support :)))
It only comes up occasionally, but remember that the default argument to `setdefault` will always be evaluated, even if it doesn't end up being used. In scenarios where you don't want that, use `defaultdict` instead. (I almost never use `setdefault` these days because I prefer `defaultdict` for consistency/readability reasons)
I would imagine that any serious applications will still just bundle a separate Python runtime with their install.
Sure, https://gitlab.com/dword4/wordfind is the repo for this project, just keep in mind its so very rough right now that I don't have anything even resembling documentation for it, all that will come much later once I have the code somewhat functional.
Oh, good. I was worried the Python community would get stuck supporting some ancient version of Python until Microsoft got around to updating it a decade after its release.
It is. It's going to be in the Windows Store, not part of Windows.
&gt;Apple made the right move. Apple stopped updating their Python install.
I mean if I'm paying a full thousand dollars for a monitor stand I better get fucking lifetime support on it!
I think that's exactly his point
If you want to get the name of some character for a name escape, you can use the `'namereplace'` encoding: def get_name(s): return s.encode('ascii', 'namereplace')
Probably makes sense since they can have swift to meet most of those needs.
Python.
This bodes well for Microsoft to replace VBA with python as a scripting language in the office suite. I’d be very happy with that. [discussion](https://exceldevelopmentplatform.blogspot.com/2018/01/will-python-replace-vba-as-inbuilt.html?m=1)
All this does is install Python from the windows store. As long as that continues to be updated, you will get the latest version. Windows 10 is not taking any dependencies on Python itself (which is the usual reason the Python version languishes in distros)
The version of python shipped is only 2.7, really old, and only used for legacy software. Most people will use homebrew to install Python, making the built in one useless to many.
On the other side of the coin, now you can have Linux sysadmins administering armies of both windows and Linux machines with one scripting language. Windows is not likely to go away for business any time soon. Microsoft dug very deep moats and managed to modernize before most of their customers jumped ship to linux.
I can definitely appreciate that the question posts are a lot of work to moderate. I like that this sub does not allow questions, even though I post a lot more in learnpython. But I use the subs in completely different ways. open learnpython sorted by new and look for questions that are something I can explain, where the OP has stated the question with reasonable clarity, and there is not a good answer already. I don’t really care if I am away from it for several days or longer, and it isn’t important to me what threads become popular—in fact, the more popular and commented on the post is, the less likely it is that I have anything of value to add. I expect the vast majority of posts to be something I don’t care about, and for any given post, as long as a person or two has tried to answer, that post has served its purpose. Redundant questions and low-effort posts are to be expected. Here, I look at almost every post, and especially so if it has a lot of upvotes or comments. If I am away from the subreddit for a while, it’s still meaningful to check what has been posted over the last several days. It’s meaningful to go back to something to see how the discussion has continued. The comments come from people who are confident enough in their knowledge of python to state an opinion, and I am interested to learn about what people think and why. On this sub, when I see a simple question post, especially a low-effort one, I have no qualms downvoting or reporting it. When people ask more advanced questions here, I have no qualms— but I admit that drawing a line between simple and advanced questions is not easy. I myself wouldn’t want to totally filter out the questions on this sub using flares because I do care about making sure people get help and I sometimes want to know how the answers are explained. At the same time, I feel this sub would easily be overwhelmed by the volume of question posts, and so lose something of its soul. And I think 99.5% of question posts really are better served by learnpython, where they will probably get a faster reply and the responders are prepared to be patient with the OP. Maybe as part of the middle-ground we could make it a rule that beginner questions are still discouraged. I think the division between here and learnpython is a very useful one, and I am concerned that blurring the distinction will make this place worse. But I really do get that this rule is a lot of work to moderate. So I am not insisting on anything. I think mods of any subreddit basically have the right to whatever rule makes sense to them, given the volunteer nature of the job. If users find the rules or the resulting environment intolerable, they can make their own community. Do what makes sense to you. And thank you for soliciting our feedback.
if this spins up locally hosted docs like Go does, sounds perfect.
And Apple is removing Python. What a time.
I am on Mac OS. Had Zeal previously. Pretty good. But I vaguely remember that it is not as easy to navigate as python's website.
Are you intend to distribute your final product as a commercial or just for learning? If latter, I suggest go with PyQt5, which basically has every components you need to build any gui or desktop applications. The downside with PyQt is, the learn curve is a bit steep.
Are you a part of the CS program or some other technical discipline? I’m a part of IT at my university and if people make a relevant request relating to their program we will normally do a deployment to those machines in the labs for that school. Talk with a faculty member to get them to push and make a request. I have grad students in the engineering programs asking for special special stuff and as long as it’s not licensed we will usually accommodate them.
I am majoring in CS at the local community college while attending high school, but it is a no-go on the whole "administration will understand." It is a small school, so there is no dedicated IT department. Instead, the office manager does the IT related tasks, although she has no Cisco certification, college degree, or past experience in any tech field. In fact, we are not allowed to bring a mouse to school, because "the drivers would fill up the computer and make it crash."
nah its just for learning, and maybe publish on a opensource site such as github. yeah im aware of some of the GUI options available im just looking for someone to assist with it.
This is still very early in development. I plan on adding more encryption types. If you are willing to contribute and help add methods I would really appreciate it! Hope this helps you encrypt data. Use Case: For me I use this to encrypt my json objects that are used in temporarily storing data.
Sorry to hear that. Get your general Ed credits and move on to a proper school. Best of luck.
Hey Thanks man! This looks closer to what I wanted. &amp;#x200B; I had Site sucker as an alternative but this is better.
Doesn't macOS currently require Python 2.7 to function? I would hope they stop including it as it is being depreciated.
*Glares at Apple.*
Wish Apple would take a cue from this.
&gt;Bootsnote Interesting. I wonder how it is different from writing markdown in VS code though.
well, i use linux, so i don't care, but i think that this move won't be safe, because it'll be easier to write malware, cause python is an easier language with big collection of libraries.
Would you like add Genius expert support stand care plan at just $499/pm ?
Why not just put anaconda on PATH?
Looks better than mine. Nice use of a class.
Basically, I hate the concept of app stores on desktop machines. The old and tested method of `.msi` installs was great and working, I wonder what made them get rid of that. Now that WP flopped in the mobile market too, what's the use of having App Stores on desktops?
And their cheese grater
I hope it is sarcasm! Because as a windows user, I never had to depend on Microsoft to get python, I always got it from &lt;python.org&gt;.
Centralized and standardized automatic updates.
why? Windows needs a proper package manager like Chocolatey.
well...ill be honest anaconda simply recommended not to download on path LOL but i was thinking that might actually solve my problems...but wasn't too sure. Will I be able to run Anaconda on the normal command prompt this way?
Wowee zowee a feature they should have included a fucking century ago! I'm amazed! (Kidding, obviously. Someobody rape my retard fucking face, cut off my dick, and force feed me my own testicles).
Centralized installs and updates can happen through robust CLI tools too such as pip/apt/composer/nuget/etc. Is there any special need to make it all grandiose like play-store does? If yes, then it should be an optional feature for those who are asking for it, not for everybody. As for `.msi`, it is very much a standard format for installation and updates. In fact, there is a popular packaging system called `chocolatey` in the windows world which automates .msi installs.
You can do what makes sense, but companies would use and develop in old built-in versions as present 2.7/3.4 experience is telling us.
Because windows is already large enough without adding more bloat most people won't use.
I was just thinking, "great, few years into the future we will try to make people move away from Python 3.7", but this sounds better.
It "did". _Scripting language_ runtimes are deprecated in 10.15, to be removed in future versions.
Yeah, I thought even that version 3.7 was picked to mock us all
Dont forget defaultdict
That’s fair. It’s the same approach they took with Java and many smartphones took with Flash Player. It’s just inherently insecure to have fresh OS installations with old and likely vulnerable scripting runtimes installed.
Yeah, good point. I am amused by the trajectories of these two companies, though.
You have more control with walled garden. Seriously at least since 2000 (I'm sure it was earlier) Intel, AMD and Microsoft were introducing various mechanisms to have control over what code can run on their platforms. It is hard since PC started with being open and allowing you to run any code. When smartphones appeared they learned their main and started with locked up system. It's already 10 years since then and people got used to it, so Microsoft used windows phone as an excuse to try doing it again on the desktop.
Well Windows 95 had its own optional Script Host (WSH) component, similar to batch files but more expansive. It became standard in Win98, and still exists to this day in modern Windows. Out of the box it supports VBScript (.vbs) and MS JScript (.js, **not** JavaScript). It also can run other languages like Perl 5 and Python (.pys) with the appropriate suites or packages installed. In fact it supported a lot of IE automation via ActiveX. Not to mention QBASIC was included with MS-DOS 5.0 and was available all the way up to Windows 2000 (no longer included). So MS has a history with scripting lanagues a lot longer than you’d think!
Also for this specific case `collections.Counter()` is probably what you want if you're accumulating integrals.
It's not. On my machine, the "unpythonic" version takes 73.5ns ±2.3 if the key is *not* in the dict, 103ns ±4 if it is, `dict.get` takes 230ns ±25 in both cases.
The windows app store is their equivalent of apt/yum, it's windows though so of course it has a fancy GUI.
Are you on drugs. Couldn't malware be packaged WITH python if the miscreant so desired?
I believe it's a reference to MacOS, which [ships with a weird build of Python 2.7 that never works.](https://xkcd.com/1987/)
From a first glance over the code, it seems to work only on dicts with string values? If so, it seems fairly limited and does not cover many real-life scenarios as usually JSON objects are nested.. Also, I see a lot of "if self.type == 'cbc'" in all methods. There has to be a better way to do this. But the idea seems fine, especially for implementing more secure client-based data storage, which is a big problem we are facing.
There are so many things wrong with the old way - people have to find the correct web site and individually judge the trustworthiness of author and distributor with limited info on either. People are terrible at this. - Even legitimate software often bundles malware or "offers" - Without info about source material it is difficult to identify malicious software and facilitate its removal after the fact. - with no singular way to manage updates either you only get updates when you manually go back to the site or every app runs a process at startup or at all times to handle updates. Package management allows maintainers to provide a curated set of known good software that operates in the users interests and notify users if software they have installed turns out to be erroneous or malicious.
By maintaining a curated list of sources instead a singular source for all software. This is more flexible but less secure
Python won't be installed by default. There'll just be one of those stub entries that let you install it easier.

That and - defaults encoding to ascii, must opt-in for unicode literals - 2.7 implicitly calls .encode and .decode, while py3 gives an error. (a good thing) (2 even allows you to call .encode on the result of .encode)

What about using try: d["foo"] except: pass
Microsoft is slowly getting their act together it seems. They did VS code, they haven't trashed GitHub, they haven't sued Linux recently. They could find a reason not to update it, but I trust them way more than apple. They do have a thing about backwards compatiblity though. It would be cool if python itself added a way to specify right in the source file what interpreter version should be preferred. Or maybe python could stop making backwards incompatible changes without incrementing the major version, but that isn't gonna happen.
Can i have that code please
Microsoft still sees value in Windows, Apple seems to view OS X as a legacy product that is a necessary platform simply to develop iOS apps.
&gt; I’m afraid even this move won’t save Windows.. you know, they also tried to include Ubuntu and other distros. Unfortunately I see this as an attempt of the Windows OS to piggy-back on something popular (time and again). Um, what.
I oft get that feeling, too, but I'm unsure if it's just the bias of being a spurned user, or if that's where we're headed.
They just aren’t that interested. They see the future in portable devices, and to be fair they have done a damn good job with iOS. I just think that touchscreen devices are fine for consumers but useless for creators, which makes them profitable but dull.
These old versions receive security updates so they arent any more likely vulnerable than latest versions. Actually they are even more secure because they are no longer in development, old issues get fixed, new features do not get added which does not increase attack surface.
Oh really thank God It was so stupid that windows lacked python3 executable. On Mac/Linux you could just lunch python3 and on windows it was stupid and you had to install py launcher and run `py -2`
I love this idea You can script the os out of the box
Iirc, Apple just announced that python will be removed from MacOS...
Awesome. Thank you.
&gt; “I was worried the Python community would get stuck supporting some ancient version of Python...” Lmao, the Python community getting stuck between an outdated system and a well-optimized and regularly updated live version? That would NEVER happen.
Does it mean that when Py3.8 will be available it will install it automatically instead on 3.7? And what will happens with libraries and code that doesn't support it yet?
It does seem like that. And I enjoy using the iOS devices. But it's mostly for some form of entertainment. Anything non-trivial quickly becomes an exercise in handling frustration. This whole thing is providing me with so many excuses to procrastinate. "Why bother building it if I will have to switch away from Mac anyway" type of deal.
The code you posted is not good code (the use of globals is a strong code smell), and there is an excellent implementation of sorting in the standard library (use the `sorted` function, optionally with a `key` argument if you want to sort by something). Why do you want to do this?
Cheap in the hit case (73.6ns ±2.5) but humongously expensive in the hit case (520ns ±20). Exceptions are expensive.
Using CBC without authentication risks padding oracle attacks.
I have an alternative proposal: restrict /r/python just to links, without text posts. Text posts will then automatically go to two subs: learnpython and (possibly) advancedpython.
Windows doesn't need saving, it's doing perfectly fine.
If you plan to switch from pyqt to pyside, you better have a damn good motivation, which unlikely will not exist. Even py2 vs py3 was mostly relevant for a transitioning which was expected to happen. I don't see a transitioning phase to move from pyqt to pyside because, say, pyqt is going to be outdated. As for the changes qt4 to qt5, the changes are so inconsequential that it doesn't really pay off, and when you do hit differences it's in API, which is certainly not fixed by qtpy.
I used to have this problem but now I no longer do. To be honest, I'm not sure if I was just doing things incorrectly before. What I do is use Anaconda only for creating new environments. Once a base environment is created, I open vs code directly (not through Anaconda) and 'Select Interpreter' from the Python extension. Vs code remembers this from session to session too so you should only need to do it when you want to switch environments. Hope this helps.
Thank you. It seems to be very helpful.
This is a dumb and unhelpful response to a legit question. You have a strong code smell and I think it smells like “pain-2-work-with.” Answer OP’s question or be more constructive w your feed back.
mitigated? just your comment was enough to let us understand. Let them be.
Does every common use OS now the start having some variation of Python 3 by default?
It is in Arch and Fedora.
Powershell is the biggest attack surface worldwide. And there's 50 different ways to bypass execution policy. Windows will be fine.
The nice cheatsheet posted today (https://old.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/bxbcdm/pandas_summarized_visually_in_8_pages/) explains: "With a DataFrame, Pandas creates one line per column" So i guess your dataframe df is suspicious. This example code might give you a glue how to format yor data or rewrite your question: import pandas as pd import matplotlib.pyplot as plt from datetime import date from pandas.plotting import register_matplotlib_converters register_matplotlib_converters() d = {'date': [date.fromtimestamp(100000), date.fromtimestamp(200000)], 'value': [3, 4]} df = pd.DataFrame(data=d) print(df) plt.plot(df['date'].values, df['value'].values) plt.show()
Here are some thoughts. Please understand that none of this is "how you must do it" but only a bunch of suggestions that you may choose to use or ignore as you please. First I noticed an edge case in your code: If a player inputs the opponents name they will flip some of the opponents picks. In your `is_full` method you've used an entire if-else statement only to return raw booleans. You can simply return the result of the condition instead (see code below). Your winner_check method returns `True and winner` which always evaluates to just `winner`. Also if you choose to return a boolean there should *always* be a boolean, i.e. return False if the win condition is not fulfilled. After `return` you no longer need to `break`. You were using a for loop to check if "XXX" or "OOO" are in that list. Easier would be to use the `in` operator. You can shorten that section to: if "XXX" in win_con: return "X" if "OOO" in win_con: return "O" Another note, since you said you're comming from Java: In python it isn't necessary, and indeed quite uncommon, to use one file per class. In your case you can simply put the code from your App.py underneath the class code. I've taken the liberty of trying my hand at a rewrite based on your code. Some things I've changed aren't "better", just "different". class TicTacToe: template = ("{} {} {}\n" "{} {} {}\n" "{} {} {}\n") @property def current_player(self): return "O" if self.num_of_turns % 2 else "X" def __init__(self): self.board = list(range(1, 10)) self.num_of_turns = 0 def __str__(self): return self.template.format(*self.board) def process_input(self): pick = int(input(f"Enter a number for {self.current_player}: ")) if self.board[pick - 1] not in {"X", "O"}: try: self.board[pick - 1] = self.current_player except IndexError: return if not self.has_winner(): self.num_of_turns += 1 def is_full(self): return self.num_of_turns &gt; 9 def has_winner(self): # diagonal top-left to bottom-right if self.board[0] == self.board[4] == self.board[8]: return True # diagonal top-right to bottom-left if self.board[2] == self.board[4] == self.board[6]: return True for i in range(3): # rows if self.board[3 * i] == self.board[3 * i + 1] == self.board[3 * i + 2]: return True # columns if self.board[0 + i] == self.board[3 + i] == self.board[6 + i]: return True return False if __name__ == "__main__": game = TicTacToe() print(game) while not game.is_full() and not game.has_winner(): game.process_input() print(game) print(f"Winner is player {game.current_player}!")
Looks nice, but why the Venn diagrams? Why??
Can WSH really run Python if installed...? How does it find out if it is? Does it work with py3?
Some classes of creators (artists, musicians, videomakers) can get a lot done with tablets. Not everything, but a lot - and increasing with each new release. Developers, no, they will probably find tablets fundamentally restrictive forever, because their workflow really requires a “super typewriter” and they always find more ways to waste power (“yo dawg, I heard you liked VMs, so I put a VM in a VM to run other VMs”).
Nothing will take me away from Docker and Podman.
I have my dataframe exactly the way you created above
Yeah, the motivation is you don’t want to be writing GPL code. Both PyQt (qt4) and PySide (qt4) are outdated. The current versions for both are PyQt5 and PySide2. Qt5 make quite a few things easier, but yeah, I’m the grand scheme, the changes are minor. Qtpy lets you write one version for all 4 qt versions. It is really nice as a develop to let my coworkers use PyQt whatever version or PySide whatever version as a way to simplify installation. If they feel like doing minor development or use it, they can; I don’t make builds that often. When the boss can’t run your code, he/she gets annoyed. There still are some differences, but there are very few. At least you don’t have to manage the mess of imports. I’m going to deliver one version of the GUI. of 4 coworkers using the GUI, each uses a different versions of qt. Some are on ancient versions of python 2, others use python 3. Some know how to manage software, others don’t. We’re not computer scientists, literally none of us are, so the skill level regarding software varies wildly. I’m an aerospace engineer with 13 years of experience with python who codes a lot, but couldn’t tell you what a linked list is. Someone explained it to me once and I said, oh yeah, I’ve written an algorithm like that. Other people are engineers without any useful experience in python. It’s also aided the python 2/3 transition when you use qtpy. We go years without updates to software tools. It’s nice when the still work because you use a thin wrapper layer. When you finally update it, at least you’re not worrying about the GUI library.
Compatibility doesn't break with more recent versions of python 3. Python 3 broke compatibility with python 2, which is why it's taking over 10 years to get everything updated.
Read further where? There's no link.
Fixed it myself : you need to sort dataframe according to dates, otherwise the line is drawn as per position of values in array which may not be in same order as dates. Hence the lines look confusing
Download on path? Paths get screwed up by installers, but you can manage it just fine.
Nobody has certs. Just learn the tools.

the bad thing Amd laptop not popular so the price is high ryzen 5 with integrated vga card (apu ) (Dell Inspiron 15-5575) is at same price of the i7 so if you take about money i7 with mx130 vga card is good price and ryzen 7 will be more expensive than the i7 also it will come with integrated card not like i7 the i7-8565u with mx 130 is dell laptop hp 15-da1018ne i found at the same price also a good one i7-8550u but with mx150 vga it ie lenovo ideapad 330 the cpu less 3% only in performance but vga card is 20% better my confusing is battery life it is 12.5hr in dell and 5-6hr in levovo and i never got dell they say it is not good as lenovo one so what you think still ryzen 5 or go for lenovo more graphic less battrey ( i care about battery in my consideration) or hp one
Hey, maybe our T[he Most Popular Python Scientific Libraries list](https://stxnext.com/blog/2018/09/20/most-popular-python-scientific-libraries/) could be helpful for you.
The yellow warning you saw it's because you installed matplotlib with - - user. Don't worry about it. Uninstall matplotlib and run the same command without the --user flag. You might need administrator permissions.

I worked around this by setting some PowerShell aliases so when I launch \`python\` or \`python3\`, it does the expected things. Obviously doesn't work outside of PowerShell, but does the job for me.
I think it worked. Did I do any harm to my computer or is there anything I should do if I want to keep things organized or prevent future errors from happening?
Thanks a lot. Will take a look. Any suggestions where I can learn to implement these libraries ? I’ve tried a couple courses but they’re meh cause they give you codes and you just have to cram it which is the worst way of learning any language.
Check reviews.
This is pretty great tbh. I never use the built in one, and it cayses lots of issues.
It won't do any harm keeping both installs (--user and without --user). Explanation: when you install with --user you're basically telling python to install that library in AppData folder (which is free from writing permissionand and thus doesn't need administrator privileges). Because there's no administration privileges, it isn't able to add an environment variable (PATH) so that when you import the module, python knows where to look/fetch. The solution (iff you didn't have privilege rights on the machine) is to add the install path of the module to an environment variable but as a user environment variable. This would fix it. But since you have privileged rights to the machine, it's preferable to install it globally (without - -user) as this would ensure python can locate the new modules without having to worry if the path environment variable is set. This environment variable is set once when you install python, and that's it. Going forward, consider using virtual environments. In particular, virtualenv. 😊
Will they be replaced by a non-standard $999 scripting stand?
* moar telemetry data for them to sell * finer control over what you do with "your" machine * enforcing corporate deals: MS endorsed products only
I would like to do this, because I don't want to use intrinsic functions. It's just for educational reasons. And I do not really get the point why global is bad here? Would be happy if you would explain the problem wrt. global but as well my original question :). Thanks
It doesn't matter, their primary consumers don't know much more about computers other than "this button prints my document and here's where the internet button is."
I run on windows exclusively, and "python" from the command line works. What were you expecting?
Not quite. I discovered yesterday that our code written in 3.6.8 breaks when upgraded to 3.7 because we're using Django 1.11. It's because of a fix with generator syntax. We have to upgrade to Django 1.11.5 before upgrading to Python 3.7.
This is a whole thing, and not as simple as you may think. For example, what happens when python4 becomes a thing? Should “python” continue to point to 3, or should it just, one day, start pointing to 4 instead, potentially breaking stuff? It would work if there was less dramatic shifts between versions and more backwards compatibility, but especially between 2 and 3 there just isn’t.
Yes, (and please correct me if I am wrong, I seem to recall these internals but I might be wrong) I think it also pays off to remember that this is due to the fact that lists in python are implemented as resizable arrays, not as linked lists. If they were linked lists, left insertion would be O(1). Right would however become o(n) as you have to traverse the list to get to the end. python lists are optimized for appending, and they are also optimized to reduce the occupation as much as possible, hence the array implementation. but then again, correct me if I'm wrong (I'll check the code tonight)
thanks so what your opinion after update post which one laptop go for
wtf is python2
Ok that's much better
This is great! Do the creators have similar materials for other libraries?
Meh, then it's not that helpful either... Having it pre-installed would mean ability to share python scripts like executables. Any non-technical person too will be able to run it.
Does anyone know what happens for those of us with the microsoft store entirely disabled? Hoping I'll be able to just download an installer and not have windows try to destroy it.
It's a pretty common way to visualize database joins
PyCharm, you can get free license on stepic.org courses
I'm going to get some hate for this, but Jupyter Notebooks if it's a statistics or data science program
The incredible machine seems like a lot more fun than the insult machine. Great work thought.
Common yet nonsensical. Silly idea: use venn diagrams to visualize database unions and database intersects instead of types of joins.
OOOOOH :)
I run Anaconda and VS Code. However, I downloaded VS Code separately and installed the Python extension. You can then set your default interpreter within VS Code to find your python install within the Anaconda files. This should then automatically find your python packages.
It is datascience. Why the hate for Jupyter Notebooks?
Microsoft always late for the party
They dont need to care stop crying like “people dont know to python mwaaa” this is not even an issue, install python yourself if you need to you computer using tree
"Python" should always point to the latest release on your machine, and older versions should be referenced like "python2" We're still having this discussion 6 months from the end of python2 support because the community has been too scared to break anything. We need to make it the easiest route for people to use the latest version of Python

I'd go for the inspiron. Dedicated graphics isn't necessary for python dev. Disclaimer: did 0 research on this.

Have you tried running a simple hello world program of pygame? If even that doesn't work then maybe re-install pygame and see if it solves the issue.
I foresee a future in which an API change or deprecation causes software to stop working after a forced update.
I also have this python 2.7 installed on my windows 10 that I cannot uninstall. I have tried many times to uninstall it but it is installed again after the reboot.

Hey guys, I tried implementing the calculations in numpy using numpy arrays for positions, velocities and masses and instead of getting a performance boost, the performance decreased. Here is the code : [https://github.com/anishsatalkar/python\_gravity\_simulation\_pygame/blob/master/gravity\_simulation\_numpy.py](https://github.com/anishsatalkar/python_gravity_simulation_pygame/blob/master/gravity_simulation_numpy.py) What am I doing wrong?
Well done! I have a small question, what if the input number is not in the number range, for example, input a character by mistake, or input a number but the corresponding space is full, you may add some lines to check this. I also wrote such a program before and put it on Github. You may have a look [https://github.com/Juliecodestack/Tictactoe](https://github.com/Juliecodestack/Tictactoe) . I appreciate much if you would give me some advice. I wrote it after reading a book on Python programming.(I mentioned the book and the author in the readme.md file). In my program, I suppose the user play the tictactoe with the computer, and I added some steps to figure out a good move for the computer, to make it smarter, so the play is more interesting. The funny thing is, at first, I chose random steps for the computer, and it easily got defeated. Then I modified little by little, and this time I lost the game. Seeing how it became smarter with the improvement of the my program is really a fulfillment. You may have a try.
I'm going to rephrase your questions slight as one particular question: "What if this messes up how the subreddit currently is and it becomes a questions subreddit?" At its core, I think that the gradations or levels that you've outlined all kind of lead us in this direction, so I want to speak to what my expectations of this outcome are, and what sort of actions we might take as a result of these outcomes. I don't intend for this to become "a help subreddit". One of the nice things about the bot that I'm thinking about is that it compiles a list of flairs that are used. This could be disclosed / public, and if the flair usages get really out of whack (ie - if help flairs starts taking off as a big thing) then we would certainly reevaluate. Part of this would be deciding what sort of "critical mass" would be required to rejig the system; if "help" is more than 10% of posts, or if objectively simple questions start getting a lot of upvotes, then I would say that this is problematic. There's another thing you said here: &gt; People didn't sign up to this sub to get distracted by beginner questions. A surprising amount of people sign up for this sub because they have beginner questions. Making a blanket statement like this is really hard to support, because as someone who reads a lot of the things on the subreddit, I don't think it's actually supported by data. &gt; Being able to filter is not a panacea; that same argument could be used to justify having Ruby questions answered here. I don't think this is the case. Clearly beginner questions about python could be understood to be part of a python subreddit, and just as clearly *any* questions about Ruby can be understood to be unrelated to Python.
This, for Red Hat or CentOS the python included is for the system, for example yum package manager is written in Python. I would go further than suggesting using virtualenv. You don't want be tied to system Python at all, for example on these distros you actually can use http://ius.io repo and have access to any version of Python, you can even install multiple side by side, combining these with virtualenv your application is completely disconnected from the OS. There are equivalents on other systems, for example on FreeBSD they made a smart decision to make system base not depend on any accepting language, and similarly they provide all python versions packages. On openSUSE I found opt-Python repo which similarly has multiple python versions and installs them in /opt to avoid conflicts with the system I'm sure other distributions have similar solutions
It's not a conventional IDE, I guess? I'm currently pursuing an economics program and I kind off enjoy the experience of Jupyter Notebooks, though occasionally I do switch to spyder if I'm working on, say for example algorithms. Truth be told, give everything a swing. You're doing no one harm by using anything else.
Based on your updated. All these will perform sufficiently. If they were all the same price I’d stick with intel/nvidia. Don’t neglect keyboard layout and feel. If you can find a laptop and try typing on it.
Wait so your baby isn't a concrete implementation?
That stand truly is the gift that keeps on giving.
Ubuntu needs to get the hell on this.
Or chocolatey windows store extension, just saying.
In no way should this post be construed as a grievance against r/LearnPython which I think is **brilliant** and I think any answer we have will still include directing people to /r/learnpython which I consider to be the sister subreddit to this one.

Well, for around 2000 particles, I am getting a performance increase of around 3x. But was hoping around 10x-20x using numpy!

I'd be pissed if I downloaded an installer for some program and ran it and it told me to download and install all of its dependencies and then run it again. The installer for an application should install all dependencies. The thing Windows is missing is a package manager. You should as a third party developer be able to declare your dependencies in a standard format that Windows will parse during the installation of your application and go out and install them. Commonplace things like Java and Python should be available through the package manager. I don't want to install 40 copies of the same Python version because the applications that depend on them are distributed as frozen binaries. The Linux world successfully employs a variety of package managers and I don't know anything about Mac but I think their Homebrew is basically the same thing. There is an unofficial package manager for Windows called Chocolatey, but unless it magically becomes available by default or automated install (hey Windows I require Chocolatey so go out to the store and get it) then it does not really solve the problem. Note: I've been a Linux user almost exclusively since 2009 so my knowledge of Windows is not really up to date.
Please take a look at Visual Studio Code. It has an excellent Python plugin that includes syntax highlighting and a solid debugger. PyCharm is excellent also, but seems a bit 'heavier'?
Global are just a bad habit to use. As your code scale and becone and bigger having variable that are available everywhere makes it hard to debug. One of the most important paradigm of coding is to keep everything separated and as contained as possible. Nothing should have access to more data than it needs in a perfect world and global go against that paradigm. Globals are find for quick prototypes and certains very specific case. If you are learning, you should avoid using bad habits.
It's like they intentionally decided to create something that exemplifies the "no, really, people will buy \*anything\* we put an Apple price tag on" phenomenon.
You seem to be very ignorant about computer operating systems. Especially since most casual windows users are just as ignorant about computers, if not more so
Yeah, even on systems with an up to date Python install by default, the first thing I do is still install Anaconda
People who care can still manage and maintain the environments they need? I’m new in python and there seem to be several apps that make this easy. The list of persons that both randomly decides to use only the App Store python and needs to worry about a specific environment seems small
There is a community edition which is free on their, JetBrains, website. For those who will object, indeed it is big and eats laptops for breakfast but I get way more done per hour in it.
Hi do you have an email to contact you to learn more about these openings? Thanks
The question wasn't rhetorical. I planned to give a different answer depending on what the user said - I'd give a different answer depending on whether the user had written the code themselves and was doing this to learn Python, was doing this for a homework assignment and had been given the code by their tutor, or was trying to solve a problem for work.
Hello do you still have these python developer openings available or have they been filled?
performing tasks on stepic.org you get a professional license for the all product pack for 3 months
Thanks, recently started using the logging module in production and it’s absolutely amazing
IIRC pycharm shows a visual rendering of markdown. I believe it does the same with reSt. It's however not an editor, rather a side by side on the fly rendering.
Do you still have these openings available or have they been filled?
Yes I think it’s part of a suite called ActivePython, been a while since I’ve dabbled with it though.
So, if you want to sort by `row[x]` first, and then by `col[x]`, the smallest change you could make would be to change: if row[b] &lt;= row[end]: to if row[b] &lt;= row[end] or row[b] == row[end] and coo_A.col[b] &lt;= coo_A.col[end]: Although it might be more readable (and easier to adapt if you need to add more comparators) to create a function: def _special_less_than(row, x, y): if row[x] &lt;= row[y]: return True elif row[x] &gt;= row[y]: return False if coo_A.col[x] &lt;= coo_A.col[y]: return True else: return False This also shows why having `coo_A` as a global is problematic. You might end up making it so that you can plug in different `less_than` functions, to sort various different types of data in different ways, but your function always sorts `coo_A` as a side effect of sorting `row`. It might be better to turn it into a generic method for sorting lists, and sort `row` and `coo_A` simultaneously by combining them into a list of pairs: # Quick Sort def partition(row, start, end): a = b = start while b &lt; end: if row[b] &lt;= row[end]: row[a], row[b] = row[b], row[a] a += 1 b += 1 row[a], row[end] = row[end], row[a] return a def quicksort(row): return _quicksort(row, 0, len(row)-1) def _quicksort(row, start, end): if start &gt;= end: return p = partition(row, start, end) _quicksort(row, start, p - 1) _quicksort(row, p + 1, end) # To use combined = list(zip(row, coo_A)) quicksort(combined) row = [c[0] for c in combined] coo_A = [c[1] for c in combined]

They break compatibility every version and sometimes in minor versions. The issue was unicode is hard to get right when all the tutorials suck and nobody knows it. It was so bad people just said screw it. Also, python 3 was slower until 3.5.
I would recommend Scrapy. It would make the link following part easier and it has json and csv output. https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/intro/tutorial.html
python to bring up python 2 python3 to bring up python3 Like on OSX/Linux Instead unfortunately they're both named python. It made transitioning harder then it needs to be(Mac/Linux also have symlinks with point versions so you can also run `python3.7`)
I thought Arch fixed it to python3, or is it still wrong?
Nope python3 binary is great, the only problem was that windows didn't have that command
VS Code does not have a data viewer for Pandas DataFrames in debugging mode which is a deal-breaker for me.
Everyone who actually use ruby or Python install new version by themselves anyway.
This is good news, can't wait
Aw thanks!
I know this is a late reply, but is it okay with you if I clone it to make changes?

That's not true, Python 3.7 broke the fuck out of shit by making `async` a keyword. For example: - [PyHive](https://github.com/dropbox/PyHive/issues/148) - [Apache AirFlow](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2716) - [Celery](https://github.com/celery/celery/issues/4500) - [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen/issues/8328) - [Twisted](https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/9384) - [Motor](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/MOTOR-248) Now, making async a keyword was *probably* a good decision, I'm not questioning that particular choice, but it's patently false to say that new versions of Python are backwards compatible. Shit **will** break, and I hope to god that it's possible to defer updates or to keep your old version of Python around when you update.
That's the way its gone, its very consumer friendly to have a store serve as a location of safe apps that are updated regularly. Windows is primarily a consumer OS. Anyone who needs a different version or wants better control will just uninstall it and setup their own environment.

Seems like they are working on proper datascience support: [https://devblogs.microsoft.com/python/data-science-with-python-in-visual-studio-code/](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/python/data-science-with-python-in-visual-studio-code/) However, I have to retract my recommendation due to the relative immaturity of the features they do have compared to other available choices in this space! Worth keeping an eye on it in the future though. It still is a great choice for general python scripting though.
I would not worry about the editor very much, starting out: use the editor that the instructor uses so you don’t get bogged down on differences. As you grow you’ll get some preferences for your tooling and you can try out different editors and IDEs as you like. If you notice friction with Atom, be thoughtful about why that friction exists and whether there are solutions to that in a different editor. For me I like to use vs code, with a vim plugin that relies on neovim, but others prefer emacs, some nano, and others prefer sublime. It’s up to you and there are a lot of ways to do the same thing. Sometimes you’ll prefer one tool over another depending on your goal. What matters is what matters to you. Python is pretty cross platform already, and the editor you use to make your programs shouldn’t affect that.
Sure, go for it
as long as i can brew install python i'm fine. the real problem is the hardware is even more overpriced and less polished than before. proud owner of a 2012 mbp still going strong, but i seriously doubt i'll buy a mbp again.

I think all of this sounds good. As an aside, can we have a discussion about the "What's everyone working on this week?" threads? I think it would be great if these weren't in contest mode. When there are ongoing discussions on a particular project, it makes it hard to follow and find when it's randomized with all of the threads collapsed. I'd rather make it easier to see the top projects that people are discussing along with the discussion. These weekly posts are some of the most valuable posts that /r/python does, but contest mode makes it less useful to review.
Wonder at what point it would make sense for them to split up the company.
[PEP 394](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0394/) was written to address exactly this. The TLDR is: Some distros did that, it broke things, badly. So until a critical mass point gets hit, \`python\` should keep being \`python2\` so peoples scripts don't break at random. &amp;#x200B; However most people should be smart and running python in a virtual env or docker now... so it really doesn't matter.
As a web developer IE not following stanards is still a huge pain in my butt. I could see that happening easily to a specific version of php they decide to adopt.
Sure, I can make that change.
Not a tutorial. I created this simulator after I somebody else's simulation video on this subreddit a few days ago. I love physics and coding. Hence I created one myself. If you want, I am happy to make a simple text based tutorial. Let me know! 🙌🏻

I can post a comment here once the survey is done on the results. :)
Good for you! AFAIC, my review would be even worse than before : no integration with vscode's interactive mode, buggy pycharm plugin with latest version :/
Sounds good. I'm not farmilar enough with reddit's internals, but is is possible to show a message to users before they post informing them that they may get better help on learnpython or Discord if they're asking for help?
We do that in several places already (the sidebar and submission page) but that doesn't seem to help much.
Can you describe the PyCharm bugs in the latest version? I'd like to send them to then engineering team, along with a request for integration with the interactive mode (I don't use VS Code enough to help there).
Isn't it already there? I haven't checked for years but I remember a thing called oneget that did that.
Awesome, thank you!

Pretty interesting situation. On one hand it will now be even easier to manage my local versions of Python on my Mac. On the other hand, its possible I would have never started learning Python without it being preinstalled...
&gt; The old and tested method of .msi installs was great and working, I wonder what made them get rid of that. Microsoft isn't getting rid of `.msi` and they have in fact published a successor standard that is even better in `.msix`
Check your first run and active setup reg keys. Whomever built the installer for python 2.x sucks at building installers.
They aren't including python though ...
Yeah I brew installed for 3. Still a little bummed.
I work for a company that accepts large data from our clients and imports it into a web app. The process of moving these files between servers and doing an integrity check on them were all done manually. I wrote a python program to do the moving and checking of files automatically as well as kick off the import. Only a few hundred lines of code and a couple of hours spend coding it, but it frees up 3 hours of manual labor.
That's what PowerShell is for though. Yea you'd like Python, but it's Windows so if you need to do that just use PowerShell instead.

It would be fun to see how long it would take people to stop buying Apple if they start going backwards with technology. I'm thinking somewhere around the abacus 7s and the slide rule X the Apple fans would get suspicious.
Very cool, I am looking to perform a similar process at my workplace. What were some of the libraries you ended up using to move these files?
I recently used pyautogui, a library that allows for virtual keyboard and mouse input, to automate the process of installing and configuring applications on new computer deployments for my IT department. They use to have to go in and configure each application manually multiple times a day. This program did the same thing, just automatically.
&gt; couldn't install This doesn't provide nearly enough information for anyone to come up with a helpful advice. Did you get errors while installing? Did it seem to install fine but your still got an `ImportError` when you tried to import it? Or anything else? If there are error messages, please post them here and specify the exact actions that lead to them. If there are none, please explain what exactly went wrong (how it behaves and how you expected it to behave).
The only library I used was Pandas and that’s mainly because the data sets are csv files. I just evoke Robocopy with Python since the severs are Windows and it’s already built in.

That's sick! I'll need to look into that!
I did what you describe in 3 different companies I worked at. &amp;#x200B; In the first company I wrote an AHK script that shortened a really boooring task from what took 5 people and 4 hours of work each to the script doing it in 10 minutes automatically. It was a sys admin-ish type of task that required ssh login into remote networks, running some commands, taking a screenshot of their output, saving it locally, and later uploading them to a ticketing system. This was a helpdesk/support role that I was in. &amp;#x200B; In the second company I wrote a scraper for Quora in Python, since quora (intentionally) doesn't have an API so that you wouldn't exploit "hot questions" for content marketing purposes. That's exactly what we did :) I was in a marketing role here and the script really brought a lot of value to us, since we were a startup and needed to be super efficient with time and money. &amp;#x200B; In the third company I wrote a bunch of utility scripts in Python for tasks like data normalization and formatting (mostly .csv files / Excel tables), and log analysis. I also had to use the dreaded Windows machine yet again, so I wrote a relatively big AHK script that gave me Windows experience on steroids, since I had every important / common action on a hotkey. Also, I used AHK to store all sorts of text templates, since I was working as a tech support engineer and I had templates for most of the usual communication with the clients through ticketing systems. &amp;#x200B; Today, I'm finally working as a python developer and I have to say that all those little scripts were a nice warmup for further learning and coding. &amp;#x200B; One more thing that I'd like to mention -- it's one thing to write a useful script, but promoting it to get clout can be tricky. It's more of a social / soft skills problem, so don't just go around bragging, think about how you're going to "sell" it to the management and your colleagues as well. &amp;#x200B; Also, consider trying AHK for some of the automation and hotkey stuff, if you are using a Windows machine.
You're right of course, since Glassdoor tells you salary based on location, which is one of the biggest factors when it comes to salaries. And the same message goes to the OP -- looking at average salaries for a certain type of positions on a country-wide level can be indicative of what to expect in general, but you really need to focus your research locally.
The developers would never break back-compatibility between versions, that's ridiculous! /s

Truth is, I heard about huge [objects 'cutting holes' in our galaxy.](https://www.mnn.com/earth-matters/space/stories/massive-hole-milky-way-galaxy) &amp;#x200B; I had a theory that it was 4th or higher dimensional objects. &amp;#x200B; What would happen in a simulation where a 4th dimensional object entered the 3D plane, and then upon exit, ceased pulling on the planets around it - sort of like dimensional rain. &amp;#x200B; I was wondering how you made yours and with what formulas, to try throwing extra dimensional objects at with some speculative math.
Hey anyone joining?
Ipython also works great with asyncio
Working on a tool to download multiple episodes of a show from a website.
If I see this correctly, you only specify your FFT values in the plot, i.e. only the values in y direction. This way python automatically uses the index within the array as the corresponding x-value. You need to plot the data using what you called freqs as the array in x-direction. So the command for plotting your data should be plt.plot(freqs,dataFft) Not sure what fft.fftshift does, I have never used that before. I cannot say if you need that or not (maybe try it with and without that command and see which is the expected graph)
Done! That was pretty short.

Second test should have "==" instead of "=".
you're missing the second "="

missing an equal sign, bub
Ok thanks but new problem
So it opens the shell and says line 6, in &lt;module&gt; roll_again == "yes" or roll_again == "y" Name error name 'roll_again' is not defined
you have to put it in an if else statement
Which line

Not knowing the data you're working on, it's hard to judge that result, but I think this should be what you are looking for. Keep in mind that most of the stuff to either side is noise in your signal. Try zooming into the central peak by only plotting from say -0.1 to 0.1 or something like that.
You should first of all don't paste a Foto or screenshit here, but instead post your code in the appropriate markdown syntax. If the code is longer, link to a pastebin like gist.guthub.com or alike. Secondly you should prefer /r/learnpython as subreddit for such questions. Last but not least: try to help yourself first! Read the error carefully and use a python repl in order to build up your script little by little. That way you can indentify much easier, which part of code leads to the error, which then makes it easier to detect the cause or search for a solution.
Thanks, I am having a look
Man, I sometimes play with JScript for mainframe automation. The language is pretty weird, but you can’t pass things in by reference! Some mainframe scripts are translated from one language to another and VBScript has pass by reference and JScript does t so the their functions are broken.
data #from csv time #from csv units of seconds &amp;#x200B; spec = fft.fft(data) freq = fft.fftfreq(len(data), time\[1\]-time\[0\]) &amp;#x200B; plot(freq, abs(spec)) xlabel('frequency \[hz\]') ylabel('amplitude \[arb\]') &amp;#x200B; The FFT returns positive and negative frequencies. If you aren't worried about energy conservation or the absolute scale of the y-axis, you can simply ignore the negative frequencies. fft.fftshift kinda flips the array \[-2,-1,0,1\] --&gt; \[0,1,-2,-1\] and is useful for presentation and is needed when doing Fourier transform spectroscopy. What I have given above ignores phase, but I suspect that is ok for your purposes.
Maybe someone at apple could *monitor* that behaviour, because, I for one cannot *stand* it.

Very helpful..thanks :-)
Thank you so much. This is great startingpoint. How do i increase the resolution so i can only see betweeen maybe 0-200hz only? your amazing
pyenv is wonderful
also how do negate the negative frequencies so i only see positve?
uh.
figured how to negate the negative just by doing .abs(freqs). how to increase resolution?
No problem. It was hard finding a good resource when I was learning this, so I'm happy to help. I think you are using the word "resolution" incorrectly. Resolution means the frequency spacing on the x-axis. So if your frequency axis is, for example, 0.0, 0.1, 0.2, ... Your resolution is 0.1 Hz. The resolution is determined by how much time you recorded the velocity for. The frequency range, which is what I think you mean, is determined by the time interval between each velocity measurement. That is both the frequency range and resolution are determined by your data. If you just want to zoom in on the plot, use xlim(0.0, 200.0).
That's not how you should do it. A better practice is to slice your array so that you only plot positive frequencies. Freq_ = freq[:len(freq)/2] Same with spec. Or alternatively just use xlim, like I showed in my last comment, to zoom in on the desired frequency range.
yeah
how about no?

Ask the question at r/learnpython . &amp;#x200B; This is not the right subreddit for it.
my apologies thanks.
Try filling those moments with podcast about programming or technologies as such. Also there are plenty of good books about the concept of programming rather than just writing the code you understand why programming languages are built the way they are. What also may help you is to start working on somekind of project just for fun, lets say your personal webpage which you can give out as a business card, that motivates you to make it look and work as best as possible since it represents you.
I have always found the best way to learn a new language is think of a project you want to do and start coding away. You will learn so much more from just doing than spending time reading or watching videos. I recommend something like codeacademy just to get the basic syntax then start implementing you project and google searches and YouTube videos later you will have a solid knowledge of the language.
&gt; I don't intend for this to become "a help subreddit" It doesn't matter what your intentions are. If you allow beginner questions to exist they will proliferate and this will be a help subreddit. Because people will come here *first* for help. It will be a help, and a news, and a meme, and a discussion, and a gossip subreddit. &gt; A surprising amount of people sign up for this sub because they have beginner questions. So what? Beginner questions are banned. Change 'signed up' for 'signed up and stuck around' if you like. The point is that the current, engaged subreddit populace are not here to see beginner questions. Just like they aren't here for Monty Python discussion, no matter how many 'signed up' thinking that's what this place was for. &gt; just as clearly any questions about Ruby can be understood to be unrelated to Python. You again missed the point. To most engaged subscribers, beginner questions are just as irrelevant as Ruby questions. A filter does not solve the problem of having extra noise in the channel. Adding flair does not make the distracting, uninteresting, irrelevant posts disappear. Flair is a way to _filter FOR_ not to _filter OUT_. Add flair, by all means. It is an enhancement for people who want to use it (say, to filter to find data science posts). But what you are proposing is to _force_ people to use it to exclude posts they don't want to see. In general, I think you underestimate how bad things can get, and how much work will be involved in corralling necessarily ignorant contributors. Discarding a black-and-white rule in favour of a purple-and-blue one will have far-reaching and unforeseen consequences. And it is not something you can simply or easily revert, as you would have invited in and endorsed a constituency that likes the change and will fight to keep it.
soup.find_all() is returning an iterable of tags to you. You have decided use the temporary variable name "link" for each tag. Now, each tag (link) has all the attributes on itself that you need. For instance: # print the href attribute (you are doing this) print(link['href']) # print the title (the stuff between &lt;a&gt; and &lt;/a&gt;) print(link.string) For each link you find, you'll need to do two things: 1. determine if you really want to follow it and get its text 2. if you do, use the same resp/soup method you used earlier on that url Since the steps you take to get the original marketwatch.com soup and the steps you'll take to get each individual article's page are the same, you should wrap the process up in a function. I've linked an example that takes as input a url string and returns a soup. https://dpaste.de/COWQ
You know what the best part of getting your CS degree is? Not having to do homework assignments. This looks complicated so I'm guessing it's something you need to know and isn't a throw away course you're taking to fill a credit. So here's my tip for you, figure it out. Google. Read your text book. Talk to class mates. If you get really stumped on a weird bug and can't figure it out after a genuine effort, format the code *properly* and put it here with a clear statement of your issue.
Thank you so much for the quick response! I'll take a look. You're awesome!
Nice fucking meme m8
I used the pysnmp modules to do some extra alerting and disk space tracking into xlsx files. Also, made a small dashboard for that same data with dash. Also made a log collector and sorter for errors and warnings. Too small of a company to afford the enterprise solutions that do the above.
&gt; Based on today's job market an Embedded Software Engineer in Lehi, UT (US) can make from $80k to $119k, with a median salary of $89k. With ~2 years experience you could make 80-85k doing what I do, but you'd have to have domain knowledge on micro infrastructure and wireless networking (not necessarily wifi, but all radios)
apt install FTW.
Choke on shit.
haha. Aye aye.
Thanks for the PEP reference So python is the new “python2 | python3” with many nuances
The [PEP394](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0394/) ref clarified this
Sure, but downloading and installing .msi (.exe) has always been the Windows way. If you're a long time windows user thats the way you're going to try to install a program. And it does work great. Anyway, I'd give the store version a try once they remove the note from the official documentation -&gt; https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#the-microsoft-store-package &gt; The Microsoft Store package is currently considered unstable while its interactions with other tools and other copies of Python are evaluated. While Python itself is stable, this installation method may change its behavior and capabilities during Python 3.7 releases
Have you seen PowerShell?
I think he was refering to the python msi installer. Which btw they didn't get rid of aswell.
...PowerShell
&gt; for the time being, all distributions shouldensure that python, if installed, refers to the same target as python2, unless the user deliberately overrides this or a virtual environment is active. &gt; however, end users should be aware that python refers to python3 on at least Arch Linux (that change is what prompted the creation of this PEP), so python should be used in the shebang line only for scripts that are source compatible with both Python 2 and 3. So arch didn't fix it? That's annoying
I think I'll join, sounds fun
Cool, can it not include all the other bullshit it comes with. Thx.
(beginner python noob) As someone who disagrees with your disagreement, I think the weekly/specific day thread is a great idea no matter what is decided. I don't like the fragmentation of reddit that is happening all over this site, but I can appreciate that some posters can be extremely annoying, expecting waaay too much. I see this happening in /r/rstats and these people are, imo, parasites who will take and never give back or follow the rules. However, I don't know where to post questions regarding more general python topics. Such as how to structure a python project, what packages to use, etc general topics that I think aren't as easily googable. So I think the general sticky thread is a great idea.
Amazing. If you told someone from 20 years ago that Windows was opening up to F/OSS while Apple was doubling down on "Not Invented Here", they wouldn't believe you. That said, it's good that basically all major OSs/distros have committed to phasing out Python2 one way or another - even RHEL/CentOS have stepped up to the plate.

I don’t know anyone who doesn’t use a version manager to install and manage their language runtimes at this point.
MIT made Scratch right? Fortunately, I'm from Scratch, and I want move to Python. Thanks!
Are there any great resources for learning data analysis with Pandas? I'd love to use this sheet along side a good learning resource :)
I took this course three years ago and then took the second one after that. Prior that, I have no good knowlwdge about programming and python. Now, I am working at an invesment bank using python in a daily basic from scripting, data analysis to automate test. Those courses are starting of my python journey.
Why does it have to be checked for the file size limit? Can you simply assume that you open each x bits of every file equally? Sorry maybe I'm not getting the problem! I definitely wouldn't care about the line count unless you make that data yourself and cab structure it in a predictive way!
Need to see the code, but my best bet is you have a simple syntax error. Just read your code carefully and you will find the bug.
haha: * You have NOT completed all the basic requirements, and are not yet qualified for the code jam. * You have completed all the bonus requirements, and will be considered an advanced user.
Yep! What I really found is that as soon as you know that you want to do, you can sort of break it down and figure out what you need to learn to make it happen. The other way around was overwhelming to me! I've been coding with Python for 8 years daily and I'm still learning new stuff weekly If not often daily! It's not a testament that this approach works better than the others, though. But it did make me feel like I was achieving something very quickly. That might help if you have limited time to do something!
I suggest you add error-checking functionality. The system can be easily broken, if intended. But nice job!
This is the right answer, AFAIK. But FWIW I prefer sublime text with 1-3 extensions (I'll edit them in here later).
Do you have any formal training before you got that job?
Ranges anywhere from 6 figures to minimum wage.
I'll do it for $100 OBO
I parsed a super complicated file in a really efficient way Then I sped that up by 500x, so a large binary file takes a few seconds. It’s at least linear up to 60 GB, so a minute later, it’s done. It then brought scipy’s savemat to it’s knees, which is kind of cool. Both the user and I thought my library was the problem.
Why does the link say 'python-2' if it's for 3.5?
I am a data analyst, and I do \*everything\* in Scratch!
Great video. I am beginning to use logging at work, this was a nice introduction. I subscribed for more content.
We manage a very large video library on YouTube (and other platforms). Around 17,000 episodes belonging to 100 and some TV titles. That's a lot of metadata (titles, descriptions, keywords, etc). &amp;#x200B; But one of the most time-consuming processes is putting playlists in the correct order after uploading a show. Although you can specify a playlist when uploading a video, you can't specify the video's position in the playlist. &amp;#x200B; So I built a script to do this, and today I finished the most awesome version of it ;-) &amp;#x200B; This was a long road, as I'm not a full-time programmer, very rusty and had to learn Python from scratch. &amp;#x200B; Originally, I built a simple script that allowed me to get all the videos in a playlist and dump them into a csv file. I would use the YouTube API Explorer to create my request and then copy-paste the result into a video editor, fix the page-breaks to make one long JSON file and then process this file with my script. &amp;#x200B; I then figured out a way to use YouTube's API, create a GCP project, obtain an API key, etc. Now I could give my script a Playlist ID and download all the videos at once. &amp;#x200B; But we still had to order playlists using YouTube's in-browser drag-and-drop interface.... which, when you have 180 episodes in one show, kinda sucks and kills your browser. &amp;#x200B; So I figured out how to update a video's position within a playlist. This meant learning the correct API call and parameters, figuring out how to do OAuth to be able to modify the playlists, and some other minor issues such as getting Excel to properly display YouTube video ids. &amp;#x200B; Though this made our job a lot easier and faster, it still needed a lot of human intervention. We had to use a script to download all the videos in a given playlist to a csv. Import that csv into Excel, use a formula to extract the episode number from the video's title, sort by this number, export to a new csv and then read this csv into a script that would connect to our YouTube channel and re-order the playlist. &amp;#x200B; Along the way, I learned to read and write csv files, to use Pandas dataframes and how to use Jupyter Notebooks; how to keep secrets in a config file, keep things out of git, moved from bitbucket back to github (thanks Microsoft!), etc., etc., etc. &amp;#x200B; Today, I finished my little project. It now reads a list of playlist ids, OAuths into YouTube using our MCN account (which allows the script to then edit/update any video on any of our channels), and then for every playlist, downloads each video's metadata, uses a RegEx to determine the episode number (regex is magic), stores everything in a dict, transfers that to a Pandas dataframe, sorts the dataframe by episode and then updates each video's position in the playlist. &amp;#x200B; What used to take hours, then tens of minutes and lots of manual, error-prone work, now takes a minute or two at most. It's beautiful and I'm super proud of it. &amp;#x200B; But there's so much more to build!
Does anyone have any samples of what people worked on in the last jams? Also I posted my [qualifier solution](https://github.com/wyattferguson/python-codejam5-qualifier) if anyones interested, Im curious to see how other people solved it.
Skip as much as you want. I like this website: [https://docs.python.org/3/](https://docs.python.org/3/)
I would highly encourage you to consider learning SQL, and looking for positions in Analytics. Very easily could be making more money than you'd make as an attorney in a few years, and your law degree could be put to good use in a variety of ways. Also, Python is a pretty powerful tool when used in conjunction with SQL. You will probably need to brush up a bit on statistics.
Why scratch and not something like Spyder or PyCharm?
I had electrical engineering background but then decided to shift to comp sci to easier landed a job when I moved to Canada. Most of the skills and knowledge I am using for the current job come from the past three years self-learning in python, and data science stuffs. I used edx for studying those subjects and the mit python courses are the best out there.
