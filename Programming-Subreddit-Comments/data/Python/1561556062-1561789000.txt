Until I can find a job where my skills lie (programming) I'm hacking my current job. You see, we print out time sheets each week, and fill out fairly regular fields each time (date, client codes, etc). **Ain't nobody got time for that.** But I got time for a Python project that uses SVG templates and the power of jinja2 to generate weekly time sheets in seconds. All I have to do is drum up a quick WSGI and share it with coworkers.
I like VSC. Works pretty well for me and has been improving. I have not done any large projects in it.
I've always thought it was the p and v operations on semaphores that required dutchness to grok.
Presuming that each page has a different url, you can construct the urls and loop them, applying your scrape function.
I've used the scrapy library and used their crawlspider class. It's really useful for dealing with pagination. [https://github.com/cbscientist/rabbit\_scrapy](https://github.com/cbscientist/rabbit_scrapy)
Very nicely done, thanks!
I did that. The urls are different solely on dates so I created a pandas series with a list of dates. If you’d like, I can PM you my code.
Yeah, sorry, don't buy this argument. There are tons of other things you might want to give people that require dependencies, not just games. The argument, "If people want to run complex Python programs, they need to learn how make virtualenvs and use the command line" is not a good one.
Yes you could post it on a pastebin or smth like that and share it here so everyone can see.
[https://pastebin.com/WdUVGdKE](https://pastebin.com/WdUVGdKE) &amp;#x200B; Let me know if this doesn't work
Less syntax for reading from a file, and the graphs are prettier, and quicker to make.
I feel the need to chime in to say: These are all EXTREMELY basic questions that you could answer yourself by either googling or browsing the Python docs. In programming it's very important that you're able to find answers to questions on your own.
It works. The problem is is that each time you are looping to the dates you are emptying the lists of top_song, song etc. So that's why you taught you are betting only one page, as you are getting the last one. Just move the initialization of the lists outside the loop.
I would hazard a guess that all of the Python GUI frameworks are capable of doing something like this. Since you said "Not much programming experience" in your post, I suggest taking a look at PySimpleGUI. [http://www.PySimpleGUI.org](http://www.PySimpleGUI.org) The way I would program this to use a single "Graph Element" (widget) that is the size you want the above to be. Then you can "Draw" onto the Graph Element the blue lines and each of the 4 quadrants. It will look something like this: [https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13696193/60187125-05b76000-97fb-11e9-963a-2a2cb755807e.png](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13696193/60187125-05b76000-97fb-11e9-963a-2a2cb755807e.png) Here you can see this concept running in your browser. It shows your mocked up drawing with the speed quadrant drawn in real time. [https://repl.it/@PySimpleGUI/RedditDashboardExample](https://repl.it/@PySimpleGUI/RedditDashboardExample) It's only about 30 lines of code in total so not much there to misunderstand. One quadrant down, 3 to go.
 [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/) Then install the Python extension as per the post link - decent editor if you're more of a Windows user. I like using it compared to some others, but would prefer a slightly easier way to get programs to run similar to Idle.
I find python to be useful in my data job, but it's pretty far down on my list of essential skills. 90% of it is SQL, Excel, and Database management.
I tell anyone trying to get into Data Science to learn Python OR R. You really don't need both. Even then, I'd learn SQL and basic excel skills first.
Even for mac btw. It's really nice.
Thanks 🙏 how Advance are you in coding?
On a scale of 1-10 : Meh.
Well better then me I haven't even started 😂😂 I just been eying and lurking.
No point in that - just get on and do something - find a mini project and hammer it until it works.
I'm glad that it's working on your end! Maybe it's the edition I have but after taking the lists out of the loop, I keep getting this error: **TypeError**: cannot concatenate object of type "&lt;class 'str'&gt;"; only pd.Series, pd.DataFrame, and pd.Panel (deprecated) objs are valid

I've still yet to find a decent python program with autocomplete as good as pycharm :(
This does history, diffs and revert well, but might be hard to separate from the entire Plone CMS. [https://docs.plone.org/working-with-content/managing-content/versioning.html](https://docs.plone.org/working-with-content/managing-content/versioning.html)
I like it also. Runs lighter than pycharm for me and debugging is better than atom.
Dedent! Better plots!
Developing tools for processing interplanetary probes images (in FITS and IMG formats) to do image processing and astronomical videos :)
What kinda of problem do you have with linting?
github.com/SethyRoosman/MandelbrotSet
Why does that make you sad? PyCharm does exist.
I am a big fan of Panda3D, and I believe it is the best option if you want both Python and 3D. However, it is very programmer-centric since it is more of a framework and does not have an editor, which could be an issue for someone new to programming. [Here](https://github.com/Moguri/awesome-panda3d) is a list of resources for Panda3D including some tutorials. If you can relax either of the 3D or the Python requirements, you can find lot of other alternatives. For example, [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) uses a Python inspired language (GDscript) as its scripting language. For Python and 2D there is [PyGame](https://www.pygame.org) and [Arcade](http://arcade.academy/)
I have been having issues with autocompletion not working with type annotated function parameters and sometimes not working at all! Hope they fixed that.
&gt; (which is a table separating columns with tabs) Why don't you just use... pd.read_csv('duty_state_10.txt', sep='\t', nrows=10)\ .to_csv('log.csv', index=False) no need for messing with file objects or `.read_fwf()`
&gt;I prefer to be spoon fed. That's my way of life
I haven't run it. The problem is hat you are using pd.concat into a list not in a pandas Data Frame. df = pd.DataFrame() # outside the for i in dates loop df = pd.concat(\[pd.DataFrame(top\_song),pd.DataFrame(song)\])
Microsoft also makes Atom so they’ll probably retire Atom in favor of VSC.
Technically it's still GitHub making atom though I don't doubt it'll be soon deprecated in favour of vscode. The one thing I like in atom is the level of visual customisation that's so much more extensive than in vscode. I hope that's coming too
Would love to see some of them(projects)! Can you share?
Thanks!, this surprisingly worked
Read the comments to that, lol
Tbh I’m not really sure but I watched the [numberphile video](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=NGMRB4O922I) to get a solid understanding of the Mandelbrot set
anyway thanks for nothing
`pathlib.Path.iterdir` and `pathlib.Path.glob` are honestly enough for most cases, preferred in that order.
1. /r/learnpython 2. Please don't post pictures of code. 3. Missing a `)` on the previous line.
Use the itertools "pairwise" recipe function (see python itertools docs): def pairwise(iterable): "s -&gt; (s0,s1), (s1,s2), (s2, s3), ..." a, b = tee(iterable) next(b, None) return zip(a, b)
But Pycharm is quite heavy weight
&gt;e fun Haha, I am still trying to figure out how lst =\[1,2,3\] works :P
The Pi is faster now. More serious, not sure what you mean. It's a bit hungry, but most people aren't developing on a machine with under 4GB of memory. I've not seen a cpu problem with it.
Just compare it with PyCharm linting. You'll see it yourself.
Easy - attach a go-pro to the modified blade of a blender, wire it up to a raspberry pi, send the signal for three pulse presses then 5 seconds of puree, snap a picture of the screen and send. This way you get your own uniquely horrific off-axis shots for your favorite python mandelbrot visuals!
Solved it ages ago Now I am trying to implement a delete function in a graph. I have ready created add edge and node function although the delete I am lost with. Appreciate the support if you know.
Password auth for a remote jupyter session is HUGE for me. Just started a new job a week ago and needed this implemented asap. I am going to fucking cry of joy OMG!!!
Just install kite for vscode
I want to make the switch and standardise on my IDE across languages but Pycharm still gets Python better than vs code.
I also want to learn how to do this... did you find a solution
 I started learning mySQL about a month ago. In order to test myself, I built a small, rudimentary billing database, then made a python script to make it easier to access, add or delete information. Finally, I created a ui in tkinter to further simplify the process. Today, I finished the first working version of the ui :D
welshboy14: &gt; Oh Pycharm, I want to find a boyfriend just like you Pycharm: &gt; Hey, I am a guy just like me! welshboy14: &gt; Yeah, but *you know*, you're like a browser to me. You just friendzoned Pycharm
Good spot there, will take care of that in my next commit.
The key thing about R is that it's for statisticians, by statisticians. Python is for everybody, by computer scientists. I'm not sure if it's still the case, but for a while the go-to package for SVMs in R was `e1071`, which I understand is literally the number of the room at the German university where the package was developed. When you compare that to Python's `scikit-learn`, which is thoroughly battle-tested, and then ask which package you'd like millions of dollars of company revenue to depend on... the answer is clear.
Your going to want to start by learning the fundamentals of programming. Then oop programming concepts. Use python as your learning language. Your correct that python can do all of what you are asking to to do but you will have to learn how to open the program and read the data from it.
Scipy has a t test in scips.stats.ttest_ind and statsmodels has a linear regression model which includes the t and significance values.
Looks like I can make the full switch from Spyder now.
Yea in the end, this is what I did! Thanks a lot :)
Wat
I need it for lasso and ridge regression. The scipy test won't work.
this is my thinking. I installed VSCode 3 days ago and, after the initial readjustment to the user interface, switched to it from Atom. It seems faster, has more features out of the box, and it was notable that it had git integrate without installing any extensions. I still have pycharm as my backup, but the more I can do without switching apps the better, IMHO.
It's ages ago, but I believe it was Tanenbaum that either use or mention p for wait and v for signal.
Ah yes the github situation.
Ridge and lasso will give you biased estimators, so using a t test is not that simple.

Thanks for the response, man! I guess I should consider telling her to switch to 2D with PyGame then. But the most likely thing would be me having to learn it first to teach her 😂 She is adamant about using Python for some reason. I've suggested starting off with some simple JavaScript browser games but she doesn't want that.

Awesome, thanks for the write up, Mike.
Dependency resolution is already supported. The arguement isn't whether complex programs should require a venv, they don't. Its whether python is the right tool for developing binaries and stand alone GUI based applications. It isn't.
I'm learning python for the first time so yeah...
I really love seeing Microsoft embracing tools and parts of the open source community like this. But... it still makes me uncomfortable due to their legacy of embrace, extend, extinguish. I know it's not really their policy anymore, but it still makes me nervous.
Thanks.. I already checked it out but sadly it didn't work for me. I just didn't like I guess🤷‍♀️
Bot for discord
I wasn't impressed with Kite personally. It didn't help much more than what VSC already does and it wouldn't stop bugging me, so I removed it.
Why do you say it's decent for Windows users? I like it quite a bit on Linux.
Please indent code by four spaces, as mentioned in the sidebar. This is what this looks like on Firefox (Android) and Relay (Android): https://i.imgur.com/PuhNsZw.png https://i.imgur.com/EagPr9c.png
Awesome man, thank you!
Being a Microsoft product, I was being terribly biased in its spread :-)
1. For learning python, use /r/learnpython 1. You're using github style markdown. Reddit markdown is different. Multi line code doesn't use backticks, it uses indentation 1. You've bad variable names. 1. `self.List = {}`: name is list, but is actually a dict. A better name would be `self.adjacencies` or `self.adjacency_lists` 1. `self.List`: variable names should not be CamelCased. It looks like you chose to capitalize the `L` in order to prevent a name collision with the inbuilt `list`. The convention in such cases is to use a trailing underscore instead - `list_` 1. `Graph.graph` is weird, since it doesn't provide much info about what the variable `graph` is supposed to hold. 1. You're using CamelCase in some places (`addNode`), while you're using under_scores in other places (`remove_node`). Be consistent. 1. Try using collections like [defaultdict](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html?highlight=collections#collections.defaultdict). If you set `self.List = defaultdict(list)`, you can pretty much get rid of your `addNode` method. 1. Your `addNode` and `remove_node` don't make sense. `addNode` adds the node into `self.List`, while `remove_node` deletes something from `self.graph` and also requires two edges? 1. What is `graph` in `remove_node`? Your first parameter gets passed automatically, and is an instance of the class `Graph`. Did you mean to create a [staticmethod](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#staticmethod)? 1. Incorrect comparison with `None`. Don't use `==` or `!=` while comparing with `None`. Use the `is` operator. So, instead of `if graph != None:`, do `if graph is not None:` 1. In a graph, if you want to specify an edge you can specify the two nodes which are connected by the edge. So, if edge `e` connects nodes `a` and `b`, then `remove_edge` can accept `a, b` to remove `e`. However, that doesn't work the same way with nodes. To remove a node, you can't pass two edges and expect to find the node that you need to remove. Overall, your code makes no sense, so we can't help you at this point.
JavaScript and Phaser is a nice combo for 2D games. If your friend just wants to learn and play around with 3D (rather than making a specific game), then [this](https://arsthaumaturgis.github.io/Panda3DTutorial.io/) Panda3D tutorial walks through a pretty simple, but fairly complete, game from start to finish.
I made a script that removes all audio files with one click, and I use it to manually purge the uploads from time to time. I haven't automated this as I may discover some cool music, and it allows me to easily find out how many people have used the converter. If one wants to convert audio files that are personal, surely they would convert the files offline (using audio converting software or otherwise), rather than upload them to a third-party website. With that being said, if my website were to become popular, I will consider automating the file-removal.
There's clearly been a cultural shift, though. People that learned to develop through the use of FLOSS-licensed software are the norm now. Embrace, Extend, Extinguish came from Gates himself, in the mid to late *90s*. That's twenty years ago, when Microsoft was absolutely dominant. They're no longer dominant, though. They're the underdogs. They're bringing the Microsoft development stack and tooling to other platforms, and they're adding a *one click* installation of *an entire Linux kernel* just so ubernerds can run Linux userland tools while still using Windows as their desktop OS. I'm going to give MS the benefit of the doubt. I've liked working with VSCode so far.
Can you show a screenshot ? All I'm seeing is the same linter module is usable on both.
Hi, I work on the VS Code team, could you clarify if you are comparing against the linter extensions for PyCharm, or the built-in "code inspections" that surface errors and warnings as you type? Thanks!
It's opensource. It's really nice when you get it setup. Microsoft also maintains several of the big packages, so they don't die if someone stops working.
VScode Runs on Linux too (at least Ubuntu).
Jupyter notebooks but that's really only for data science
I've been trying Spacemacs + Python layer + Evil mode. It uses anaconda-mode for autocompletion, and although is not as good as pycharm, it does a decent job.
For those of you having auto-complete issues with Visual Studio Code, I wanted to make you aware that we are working on a new auto-complete engine, the Python Language Server, and you can try it out by [changing your settings](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/settings-reference#_code-analysis-settings). It gets better every week, we are currently working through a set of performance improvements before we make this the default. If you run into issues, check out our [troubleshooting guide](https://github.com/microsoft/python-language-server/blob/master/TROUBLESHOOTING.md) for common setup problems and how to file issues.
Wrote a program that gets my schedule for the week for work, prints it to the console and also puts it in my Google calendar. Lots of string formatting required and learning a bit about the Google api and using mechanize for the website data but overall happy with how it is at the moment. On a side note I also found out the website I use to access my schedule also has everyone's schedule for the entire week which I can access.
I'm not sure R is "by statisticians" so much as it is a frankenstein-esque hodgepodge of different ideas from people in different professions, most of whom don't have a good sense of how to design a good language. I'd be happy to be rid of it forever, but unfortunately Python doesn't yet have packages that support the spectrum of methods that we need in our daily work. There's also the network-effect issue where most researchers tend to have R, but few have Python/Anaconda/etc. or know how to use it. Maybe someday...
Auotocomplete is definitely not as powerful as pycharm (which tracks types and understands type inference).

Does she really know python programming?
I've used notebooks quite a bit. Usually for prototyping something quickly. Then I swap to an IDE to do the heavy lifting
layers 2 and 3 in your system design are usually fairly tightly coupled and sometimes just included as the same layer. the separation of concerns design pattern usually dictates that this layer has two distinct responsibilities though: HTTP request control flow (i.e. CONTROLLER) and database access control and business entity modeling (i.e. MODEL). there are many different ways of organizing your code to achieve that separation of concerns. &amp;#x200B; what you're describing is yet another take on the widely used MVC (model, view, controller) design pattern and it's sound. in your specific case you might want to setup your database access layer as a bunch of Services where each service is responsible for interacting with a set of specific, interrelated database models. this provides a layer of abstraction that makes testing and refactoring easier.

Pycharm has been my go to for years on my personal desktop. On my work laptop though with a VM and other tools running pycharm doesn't run too well.
Hey would you want some help? We could do google hangouts or Skype live for leanring sessions! No payment needed btw. 🤗
Yeah I should've explained a bit more. I use pycharm on my desktop at home and love it. In work I have a laptop with less ram and a VM running. Along with some other tools, so pycharm doesn't run too well
Thabks. I'll take a look.
I'm following a tutorial right now so probably not, but I'll definitely let you know if I run into any errors or things that don't make sense 👍
Still working on my CI platform. It's composed of a collection of microservices, soon to be deployed into Kubernetes. I have my auth server done, and am not working on the jobs API.
Thank you!
Glad they are using a decent language to introduce kids to programming. One of the things that hurt my enthusiasm for programming when I was in high school was the choice of languages they used. It was all either Visual Basic or Java. Programming really clicked for me in college when I took a programming class in C.
Still can't point and click to method. The class/method type annotations intellisense isn't consistent
Thank you for your suggestion, just installed it, pretty good to use along with M$ python ext, but have no idea why after typed \`request.args\`, i only get 'copy()\` suggestion, not \`get()\`
If you debug the app (F5) just the output will be shown in the debug console.
Poor pycharm
scipy has general optimizers available: [https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/optimize.html](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/optimize.html)
There's also [`dpath`](https://pypi.org/project/dpath/) for this sort of thing: In [1]: import json In [2]: import dpath In [3]: blob = """ ...: { ...: "employees": ...: [ ...: { ...: "name": "Alice", ...: "role": "dev", ...: "nbr": 1 ...: }, ...: { ...: "name": "Bob", ...: "role": "dev", ...: "nbr": 2 ...: } ...: ], ...: "firm": ...: { ...: "name": "Charlie's Waffle Emporium", ...: "location": "CA" ...: } ...: } ...: """ In [4]: data = json.loads(blob) In [5]: dpath.util.values(data, "employees/*/name") Out[5]: ['Alice', 'Bob']
Agree with bolitho that with large sets of data this will be inefficient and hash is way faster. for small data sets efficiency is not as big a concern. So this is likely fine for you.. here is the example. \&gt;&gt;&gt; a = 'I am a farmer' \&gt;&gt;&gt; b = a.split() \&gt;&gt;&gt; print(b) \['I', 'am', 'a', 'farmer'\] \&gt;&gt;&gt; b.sort() \&gt;&gt;&gt; print(b) \['I', 'a', 'am', 'farmer'\] Note that the sort puts caps ahead of lowercase . You can convert to upper if that is a concern.
Your "open" statement is messed up. RTFM
PyCharm is amazing, but it's closed.
I am not judging you but I don't think people are going to be willing to spoon feed you for very long. Most want to help the beginners who try to learn themselves and spend time learning it. That is how most programmers learn, by doing and figuring things out themselves. If you want someone to do it for you I think you would be better served to go pay for a class.
Can't plug pycharm into vim. MS's LSPs on the other hand
I use Jedi with vscode and I‘m happy with it.
Makes sense but I think 2. 3. 4. could be named differently. I usually think of it like so: &amp;#x200B; 1. Controller layer controls the request and response of the service. E.G. routes requests, returns HTTP response codes. also can handle authentication and authorization 2. Service Layer controls the domain specific logic of the application. e.g. if you need to do some calculation do it here in a "Calculation Service". Or if you need to use a 3rd party service like sending an email that would happen here. Then, if you need to access the database, you would use the ORM layer: 3. ORM layer Maps relational database tables to objects. (SQLAlchemy in your case) &amp;#x200B; I usually even include front end and DB in my mental model of this, because I view those as separate entities. &amp;#x200B; Here is an example that I find helpful. It's in javascript but it will still be applicable.

If you're willing to take the adventure I'll pick up Emacs (vscode is still pretty good tho)

Python is producing the output you want; all the rest is from Powershell.
Once you understand the basics of python, [PyAutoGUI](https://pyautogui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) will be your best friend for finding buttons on the screen, simulating mouse movement, clicks, keystrokes, etc. As for launching a program, you can use python to launch the program through CMD, then use PyAutoGUI to control it from there.
Is cross language debugging possible in VSCode, i.e. debugging a python code which calls some C++ shared object via boost::python, then passing to the C/C++ debugger?
I'm not complaining. VS Code supports many good linters that work as they should work. I'm just pointing out that you can't get fast linting as you type and you also can't catch something like this in your code: If False: x = 1 PyCharm catches that perfectly. I now I can't compare an IDE and a text editor, but I just couldn't be silent about that.
When you call str(numberArray) you cast the whole array into the string '[1 2 3 4 5 6]' including the square brackets. You then call the join on this array, which iterates over every character joining them with Apple\n. What you want to do is print(" Apple(s) \n".join(map(str,numberArray))) or print(" Apple(s) \n".join([str(i) for i in numberArray])
i wouldn't even worry about the layers until your view functions are long as hell and contain a lot of repeated code, at which point it will be pretty obvious what belongs where and what layers are needed. trying to pre-plan this stuff is like trying to predict the future lottery numbers. &amp;#x200B; Just write the code knowing that you are going to rewrite it after you've learned some things about your app.
Extremely helpful! Thank you.
&gt; They're no longer dominant, though. They're the underdogs. Microsoft is the most valuable company on earth right now. How does that make them the underdogs? Maybe in a specific niche or two, but overall they are killing it.
Load testing with Locust!
I have used the pandas json\_normalize function with success in the past. Created dataframes out of json-based log files.
good answer, I would only add to that, that \`join\` adds the string inbetween each element of the list, which is probably not what you want since it will omit the \`Apple(s)\` for the last number.
vscode using pylint plugin complains about this easily?

Yeah that's true. You probably want print("\n".join([f"{n} Apple(s)" for n in numberArray]))
Sure thing.... feel free to post an Issue on the GitHub ([http://www.PySimpleGUI.com](http://www.PySimpleGUI.com)) should you run into troubles or have questions. There is nothing I see about your project, so far, that indicates PySimpleGUI wouldn't be a fantastic fit.
Did you do the googling part or reading NLTK docs?
&gt;Okay. Signing up now,
Yes, but I can't understand them. The snippets never work when I try them in Python. Not sure if I can find a simple way to analyze a simple txt file that is described in a how-to. Any tips?
I have seen [glom](https://glom.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) used for this sort of thing before. Definitely more complex than the single function in this post, but that may be what you want sometimes.
This IS a problem when I needed to switch from Ryzen 1600X desktop to old-fashioned Intel 2410M laptop. Input lags make me crazy, the whole laptop freezes. 2 cores at 2.2 Ghz are too poor for 2019
Try running "where python" or "which python" depending on your OS to see if your system Path has python in it, or if it now has multiple versions that might be causing conflict. You may need to update your system Path or specify the version of python you wish to use when calling the script.
I've had issues with it not resolving star imports or knowing types from Django.
Can you tell me more about this?
&gt; good answer, I would only add to that, that `join` adds the string inbetween each element of the list, which is probably not what you want since it will omit the `Apple(s)` for the last number. You can drop the list comprehension in both cases; `str.join` accepts any iterable so it will work with generator expressions as well. print("\n".join(f"{n} Apple(s)" for n in numberArray))
I'm doing this kind of nested dict operations a lot in production code, I find that iterative algorithms work significantly faster (in the orders of 10+ times faster sometimes).
What about if you have Anaconda distribution, I assume you can just have VSC reference your existing library?
Ik ben hiermee eens.
Your kerning needs some work but good job on the project.
Thank you. Any contributions are welcomed.
When you set up a new notebook server you can choose to password protect it instead of using a token. The pr related to the update provides a way to enter said passphrase. It doesn't support jupyter hub though.
That's great. Now, write the proof for the four color theorem.
Oh, thanks!
I liked pycharm up until the point they started to lock features into professional edition. Not features that you could call niche either. Ssh remote deployment being my biggest issue. I have found my way to vscode and although I have to use nightly builds on some things it does get slightly messy the more plugins you have to remember to use. That said I’m not about to drop $$ on pycharm for one or two features they took away and hid into a paywall.
the path in environment variables matches the path shown in cmd when I run where python. As far as I can tell there are not two Pythons installed. How would I specify the version when calling the script? I have certain scripts assigned to macro keys and that's how I usually run them.
The real test right here.
This is exactly it for me. The entire culture has shifted. They're not in the OS war anymore. They're prepared to be in the service wars, and this is how you begin winning it before the first shots are fired.
I can run one basic script but not my others. The one that runs is only using 2 libraries and I have saved it with Spyder already. Will continue troubleshooting.
When I try to run one of the scripts in Spyder it has a `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pyautogui'` error but when I try to install using pip it says all requirements are already met. &amp;#x200B; Is there some sort of special way to install libraries on Anaconda?
Not yet. It's possible in Visual Studio (VSC's big brother): https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/python/debugging-mixed-mode-c-cpp-python-in-visual-studio?view=vs-2019
Hi! The last few times I checked this out, VS code had poor introspection around dataclasses, which Pycharm does pretty well with. For instance, it had no concept of what the generated __init__ method would look like. Has there been any progress in the last few months? Is it on your roadmap? It's the main thing keeping me from seriously considering switching over as I use dataclasses all the time now.

Reinstalled pyautogui using the anaconda prompt following the directions from: [https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/pyautogui](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/pyautogui) Everything is working now. There should be something stated somewhere when installing Anaconda that this can happen, could have saved me an hour of headaches lol. Thanks for your help CreationEdge.
Thank you. I don't get why it's general and acceptable practice today to create a video to promote knowledge. The video: &amp;#x200B; \- can't be listened to in a shared office. \- it's slower to communicate information \- you can't copy and paste the code to try it out \- it won't be indexed by search engines.
The application layer is your service layer. In my experience you did the right thing and did not couple your HTTP request handling directly to the database layer. Your architecture is more scalable than if they were coupled, plus enables better unit testing since you'll be able to unit test your actual business logic without having to deal with the flask layer. It also makes your application more modular and re-usable since you can just have other applications import your application modules that encapsulate your business logic without having to deal with the web layer at all (like via command line or local GUI). Unless you are going to be distributing your business logic across many nodes, the application/service layer doesn't need to be RESTful to talk to the Flask layer, since Flask is the layer that is presenting the REST API to a outsiders, and requiring your service layer to also be RESTFul adds more complexity and encourages lazy breaking of encapsulation ("why not just call the API URL exposed at the app/service layer instead of the flask layer?) (plus it itself would also have to be a Flask application).
This? https://github.com/autozimu/LanguageClient-neovim Looks cool
&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1n-HMSCDYtM &amp;#x200B; I know this is physics, but... it feels so wrong. Nice plot, do you have the code?
Seriously though the new RPi looks awesome. I've got mine preordered
I've been writing ruby fulltime for 2 years to pay the bills and I don't mind the implicit return statements personally, and I don't even mind the optional parenthesis (much). What I do mind is: * ruby devs very often like to shoehorn DSLs into every library because ruby makes it so easy. I hate this aspect the most. * `end` sucks and I still dislike it. Give me a whitespace aware language. * Passing functions is slightly harder * No list comprehensions, although I get by with `map` decently well usually. `ActiveRecord` is nice though. You can't really talk about ruby without rails.
thanks that makes sense
Yes, it is multiple documents. I can upload them to GitHub. The relevant physics equation is L=Iw, ie angular momentum (a vector) equals the moment of inertia tensor (I) multiplied by momentary axis of rotation (w). The simulator rotates the object a tiny amount around it's momentary axis, then recalculates inertia tensor and uses the above equation and conservation of angular momentum to calculate the next w, which it is then rotated around. There is also a correction procedure to increase accuracy.
So you mean you ran "conda install"? That'll happen if you're running multiple versions of python and you simply start python from anywhere. The OS will use whichever distribution is first the path. Pip will then give you that message because Anaconda doesn't use Pip commands, it uses conda, so Pip only looks at the base python installation that you installed Pip with. You can still use your non-Anaconda version of python, too, if you need. But if you don't, I'd uninstall it to avoid conflicts in the future. Also, I highly recommend you know start looking at virtual environments! They're really easy to start using with the "conda create" command, and it'll help isolate package conflicts in the future.
It definitely shores up a couple glaring weaknesses. I do wish they'd just gone to a barrel jack for the power, but I understand why they went to USB-C. I'll wait until they get booting from USB figured out. The 3B+ is decent with a USB-SATA adapter as the root/boot device, I couldn't see anyone using it in earnest with SD card, both from the standpoint of I/O and data durability.
It’s really great.
Every time I enable it, language server process eat all my memory!
BTW, what I would put in that button right quadrant is an "Image Element". Then you simply make an \`Update\` call on that element, passing in a PNG, and it'll look like a movie at whatever frame rate you can feed it frames. I assume it's pretty slow moving stuff given your mockup. So, if you can get your mapping software to produce a series of PNG or other format images, then your display will be snap! It's a single line of code to change the image shown. And it's a single line of code to define the Image in your screen layout. Done. It's that easy for real.

I "automate" marketing for a living (SEO, competitive analysis, scraping/crawling, etc.).. the best way to find work is to look at ways to improve your process or the process flow. Examples: 1. Automate postings. 2. Pull engagement metrics (what you can) over time and build data visualizations. 3. Start finding ways to compile and manipulate the data (are your posts more popular in May? what if you used more emojis? what types of wording in posts works the best? Etc. 4. Find ways to scrape competitors postings and analyze their performance and compare to your data. Etc. Etc. Basically the long and short is to automate or improve the work product YOU provide. That's the easiest way to find projects you'll be invested in.
https://developers.google.com/edu/python/ https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/ These two should get you going. It always helps to learn a bit of the std library. You can continue digging deeper with built-ins and built-in class methods. Understand how everything in Python is actually an object and what's passed around in functions are the references. If you are to build anything I d certainly recommend setuptools, C extensions, pyqt and ipython shell.
A possible solution would be to output the data over a WebSocket to your front end visualization. Something like Django channels or aiohttp could be used to send data to the browser.
It seems very powerful.
Does the 4 not boot from usb? I plan on doing usb-&gt;sata too, so I sure hope I can
With the Django channels route, should the entire webpage be written in Django? That probably wouldn't be too complicated, because it would involve input boxes on the left, and a 3D animation window on the right.
In what way? PyCharm Community edition is Apache 2.0 licensed. Pro edition is just extra features layered on top of an open source base.
David Barroso just released something for working with nested JSON data in Python (earlier today actually). https://github.com/dbarrosop/pycatj
It will with a future firmware upgrade, but doesn't currently.
Same. Pycharm is so heavy on resources
So you would have to create an HTML page that includes js code to connect and manage a WebSocket to your Django Channels backend. Your input boxes can have their data synced over the WebSocket to control the parameters to your simulation. Something to look at in your case specifically would be the [worker and background tasks documentation](https://channels.readthedocs.io/en/latest/topics/worker.html). You could possibly run your simulation inside a consumer or as a django management command, and then send data to your websocket consumers over a channel layer.
I don’t know about `instabot`, but PyYAML is (to my knowledge) the standard, go-to Python package for interoping and dealing with YAML files and configurations. It’s a safe library.
Looks promising.
Okay, I'm just not all that experienced and I heard theres accidental ways to delete all the files on your directory with YAML if you're not careful. Also this is instabot https://github.com/instabot-py/instabot.py The requirements seem safe to me, but the pyyaml was the only one I wasn't sure about
Yeah, not sure where you read that. YAML is not an execution language like Python. It’s “Yet Another Markup Language”, more akin to Markdown and JSON or generic plain text in that you can’t actually run anything in it, other things use YAML files to define behavior and setups.
So, let me get this straight: You download the Python installer. Then you run it. Then you download the PyCharm installer. Then you run that too?
Okay cool! Thanks so much !
When I try to install it I get this ERROR: Could not install packages due to an EnvironmentError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/PyYAML-5.1.1.dist-info' Consider using the `--user` option or check the permissions.
I appreciate your advice! I've already been experimenting with much simpler Django tasks. I'll dig into the suggested documentation.
You’re trying to install it globally, which on most operating systems requires elevated privileges. On macOS, this requires running the command as the root user or with `sudo` as your user. Or, you can pass the `--user` flag and it’ll install it into a Python location in your $HOME directory (usually `~/.local/lib/pythonX.Y`).
I'm on macOS, so would the line be?: 'sudo pip install pyyaml'
Yes, but if you don’t need other users on the system to use those packages, just use the user flag. Also, you should be able to just `pip install instabot`, pip will handle all of the dependencies for you (unless you’re building it from source). If you still want to use sudo and you get a “pip not found” error, do `sudo $(which pip) install pyyaml`.
Dang :( well my preorder won't be here till august 20th (kanakit), so hopefully it's solved by then. Thanks for the heads up
Well my real issue is that once I installed instabot.py and all it's requirements and run it with `python3 -m instabot_py`I keep getting back, ImportError: files.Yaml handler requires 'PyYAML' package Install it with 'pip install pyyaml' even though I've already installed pyyaml with the sudo line and it said I sucessfully installed pyyaml-5.1.1
&gt;YAML is not an execution language like Python. Eh, [sort of](https://trailofbits.github.io/rubysec/yaml/index.html). There are YAML constructs which are designed to be directly evaluated by dynamic languages like python and ruby. There are, therefore, arbitrary code exploits made available by fully-compliant parsers. Most such parsers (including pyyaml) have a "safe" mode which does not execute the code, but that is achieved by *not implementing the entire YAML spec*. If you're using a subset of YAML, you're not using YAML. A spec which, incidentally, is begging for flawed implementations given how ridiculously complex it is.
I have pycharm which has virtualenv, but I'm not sure how to go about the process in there, even though I've installed everything I need already. The only issue is that it keeps telling me to install pyYAML even though I just did.
No offense, but the question is a bit absurd. gevent still gets over 100k downloads *per day* on PyPI. Putting that aside, even though they both do the same thing, gevent has a fundamentally different approach. It is based on implicit context switching whenever there is an IO operation. This allows it to offer functionality that will never be possible with asyncio, chief among them the ability to integrate with existing libraries. Personally, I find gevent to be faster, easier, and more pleasant to work with than asyncio. And if I had to use it, I'd still look to alternatives like curio or trio.
/r/learnpython 5 is truth-y. Try typing bool(5) and see what happens.
Sure thing. Keep an eye on [this](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/hardware/raspberrypi/booteeprom.md)

"You just friendzoned Pycharm" That's the first time that sentence has appeared in history.
Run a python shell (in terminal, "python", without specifying a file, but "ipython" is much nicer to work with). Then, bool(5). You already have your answer, but techniques are nice to have.
Go to /r/learnpython. In the learning resources in the sidebar they have resources for thise who [already know programming](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/index#wiki_new_to_python.3F). You can also get a copy of [Python Essential Reference](https://www.amazon.com/Python-Essential-Reference-Developers-Library/dp/0134173279/ref=dp_ob_title_bk) by David Beazley which has a quick intro to python followed by a comprehensive overview of modules in the standard library.
Love the software and the overall modularity of it, but it just falls slightly short to me compared to pycharm.. So for python, it's my second option :/

I'm working on a simulation for a production line. The process is non-linear so it's really hard to model. I'm using objects to represent the materials and the work stations. It's working, but I need to tweak the service time distributions.
So am I. Just found it interesting enough to share.
Thinking about design, use cases, and maintainability up front is bad? Keep your head down and just code? Someone doesn’t want to take the time to understand your complicated “masterpiece”? Yikes. I’ll pass, thanks. Most of this advice seems to fly in the face of Python’s entire philosophy.
Does gevent allow specifying the breakpoints for async context changes? That is, AFAIK the event loop wont break until we hit an await keyword. This let's you structure your code so that you knows 40-45 of a function WILL execute without interruption (and thus dont have to worry about thinks like locks on every line).
Is this... satire?
Still using Pycharm as well but I almost always have VS code on the side to open Python files outside my project for referencing xD PyCharm's not that convenient when you go out of the way to open stuff else where. For everything non-Python I use VS Code now.

Hi, I do research at my university with measuring social media tweets/comments using python. I’ve used the twitter and botornot api to determine how many twitter users in some countries are likely to be bots. You can do a lot of interesting things with python, machine learning, IBMs Watson API, and social media APIs, for example building a classifier that’ll scan through a twitter users’ tweets and determine if he/she is liberal or conservative, or a classifier that’ll tell from a post/tweet how a users feels (angry, sad, happy, etc). Good luck!
Thanks! That’s a really good point about not needing the service later to be a RESTful api
Is there a good guide to this?
I thought so.
Thanks for clarifying! We do have integration pylint integration, it runs on file save because pylint can take a long time to run. If you enable auto-save, then you will get rules as you type but may hit some performance issues. By default we use a limited set of rules so as not to annoy people with unnecessary style, etc. checks. If you want to enable the full set of rules, you can add an empty '.pylintrc' file to your workspace root. We also provide light-weight linting as part of the new language server which you can enable as a preview by [changing your settings](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/settings-reference#_code-analysis-settings). It does syntax checks, unused imports, and a few other basics, we are working on adding more rules to the new engine, so I think this should ultimately solve your problem!

A little more context : I have two variables (happy, sad) that I have set to false at the start of the program, any time any input is made that is in one of the two lists is made it sets one of the two variables to True but if input is made that is not in the list it returns "I don't understand" and starts over. However when any "happy" input is made it closes the loop and continues the program normally, anytime any "sad" input is made it still restarts the loop but happy is set to true, my else statement seems to work properly though so that's a plus.

Nah, they use nano
Your incorrectly using the “or” statement. You should be using something like if answer in [“Yes”, “yes”]: do things
You have to change the condition to "... or answer == "yes" and else condition to "... Answer == "no" Or and And evaluate different statements, or "yes" is always true.
`or` has a lower precedence than `==`, so `answer == 'Yes' or 'yes'` is equivalent to `(answer == 'Yes') or 'yes'` which evaluates to `True`. In python, strings that aren't empty evaluate to `True` in a boolean expression (you can see this with `bool('yes')` in an interpreter).
I thought pip has been part of the python installation since 3.4. Can you not access the python3 version by typing pip3?
Or you can use answer.lower() == 'yes'
if answer.lower() == 'yes': ......

This is not the best solution but I think it might be helpful `def zero2d(n_row, n_col):` `return [[0 for i in range(n_row)] for j in range(n_col)]`
You can use the numpy library : np.zeros(shape) https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.zeros.html
with numpy you can do: import numpy numpy.zeros(100) numpy.zeros((100,100))
[It actually is](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1390807), but I get your broader point. Out of curiosity, what types of things are you doing that you haven't found packages for in Python? I think the Python community has been a bit slow when it comes to the long tail of statistics functionality (no pun intended), but are there any particular gaps that you think are worth targeting?
Create a virtualenviroment in the settings of the project. Then switch your interpreter to the virtual env and then you you will be able to use the pycharm built in terminal to pip install packages.

Why is that ? Could you plz show what errors msg are in the console ?
How is this different from readlines? I think that returns the lines as a list.
That’s because `yes` evaluates to `True`; so you’re basically evaluating a tautological conditional statement. An more practical way to evaluate your answer is `if answer.lower()[0] == ‘y’`, which will work for *yes*, *yeah*, *y*, *yosemite*, etc. It is also better to do **if/else** since you are lacking an **else** statement.
Don't do this with mutable values though. `[{}] * 100` gives you an array with 100 references to the same dictionary.
I am hard relating to a meme which I saw a few weeks ago which was about automating tasks that literally take 5 minutes to do manually. Working on automating JIrA issue export and sending it as an email.
 &gt;&gt;&gt; a=[ [0]*2 ] * 3 &gt;&gt;&gt; a [[0, 0], [0, 0], [0, 0]] &gt;&gt;&gt; a[1][1]=11 &gt;&gt;&gt; a [[0, 11], [0, 11], [0, 11]]
`[0]*j` is only evaluated once. You end up with a list with `i` references to that same inner list.
Noob here, had the same issue last week, just installed openpyxl explicitly in the working folder.
Since you are you are using Jupyter. You can directly type-in type(variable) which would give you your required output.
So we end up in mess with mutable values. Got it, thanks!
Thank you for your comment. The interface is the same as a list, but Easyfile is more memory efficient. This feature is useful when you random-access lines in a large file.
Got it. Let's stick with the first
Your 2d array solution is what I do most of the time. If you're dealing with numeric arrays you could also use `numpy.zeros((100, 100))`.
Yes you can.
The writer clearly has no clue about Dutch language and culture. 😂

I'm working on [https://www.scrapingninja.co](https://www.scrapingninja.co) which is an API for Web scraping that handles rotating proxies and headless browser (Headless Chrome). Basically, you provide an URL, and and it returns the HTML code. I've been scraping the web for different companies and industry for a long time, and I often had to implement strategies not to get blocked. Running headless browsers is often necessary because of modern front-end frameworks and AJAX everywhere, but it's a pain to manage at scale.
This whole system is remarkably over-complicated. I like the idea of a standard, third-party auth library, but man is this trying so hard.

Did you read the repository README?
Yes, but like I said. I’m stupid and don’t understand.
Why not just ``` def zeros(x,y): [[0 for j in range(y)] for i in range(x)] ``` This _should_ create a new instance even if you don't use the literal 0.
What don't you understand? The four color theorem or the code?
Is there a reason why this efficiency is so important in your applications that you do this frequently? I'm just surprised that list appending is your bottleneck.
Interesting post. Saved!
I prefer **plotly** over bokeh for its shallower learning curve. You can use igraph with **plotly** to make beautiful and interactive **network graphs** like this. &amp;#x200B; [https://plot.ly/python/3d-network-graph/](https://plot.ly/python/3d-network-graph/)
Is there any such library that is not total overkill?
Yes
Look for Python and Machine Learning (separetely!) courses/tutorials for beginners
You could write the graph to a gexf file with networkx using write\_gexf and then open it with Gephi. Gephi has several layout algorithms to help visualize a large graph. &amp;#x200B; Alternatively, someone wrote the force atlas 2 layout for networkx that you can install with "pip install ForceAtlas2". More info at [https://github.com/bhargavchippada/forceatlas2](https://github.com/bhargavchippada/forceatlas2).
Love it, I like to see a similar for pandas. numpy is quite intuitive, while I find pandas the opposite. there are way too many ways to do stuff.
THanks for your reply .
I've been using vim for about 2 years now, mostly because I can't figure out how to close it.
Good work. A little tip: If one is completely new to programming, code can be very intimidating. So it's important to keep it as short as possible to get the point across. In your first example you use comments to explain what is happening, bevor even explaining comments. Maybe you should start with explaining what the # does or add a little box that mentions this.
That was Dijkstra wasn't it? Tanenbaum works in The Netherlands but he's an American.
Well I'm Dutch but I'm having lots of trouble getting my head around asyncio.
That sound very plausible.
Same. It is described in one of the longest manual pages in the python manual which reflects the complexity of the asyncio module.
Loo at Flask and Flask-Socket. More simple and immediate imho.
After refection, I moved like 80% of the foolery to the END of the article so that those who are just there to learn can do so without having to wade through my weird brain. Every writer needs and editor! Thank you so much for bringing this to my attention!
But in your code you already used the type() method? For your next question maybe try to google it by yourself.... ex: google python 3 type() \--&gt; One of the first results: [https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-type-function/](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-type-function/)
You can use `gevent.sleep()` to switch at specific points.
It's absurd if you already know both of them. It's not if you are trying to learn how they work and how they overlap.
&gt;Although practicality beats purity. The cost of being explicit in this case is extremely high. There are decades worth of protocols and corner cases being completely return. Maybe if the async keyword had excited since the beginning it would be different. &gt;If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea. I've read quite a lot of posts and blogs about how the way async was implemented makes it unnecessarily difficult to understand.
It's absurd to ask if it's redundant. It's great to try and understand them.
&gt;Two closed 10 month ago issues &gt;One not related issue &gt;One issue no one cares about You got to try harder

Hmm interesting, your work laptop is always running a VM for dev work? Never heard of that before so I'm curious. I just complained about performance enough and the need for a beastly laptop became apparent enough that I got one. No VM tho, just a domain account on Windows.
I've had some weird memory issues with pycharm and leaving it on after the computer has been asleep. This is with my newish 16gb ram laptop that also has a decent i7 cpu. Restarting usually does the trick. I can't imagine the things it would do on a lower spec pc, because it is pretty much unusable once I get to that point. That said, I fucking love pycharm and use it everyday for work. No regerts
Nice , clean website you have :) Here, in Singapore, you probably will get a temp position a dollar higher than average (USD 6 vs USD7/hr) if you know intermediate Python. Is it true for US too?
I applaud introducing the concept of objects immediately after variables for the absolute beginner. Presented in the right context (which this does), even those with no coding experience at all can grasp the concept. Too many tutorials treat OOP as an advanced topic rather than the foundational one it has become. Introducing data structures early is also a good idea. However much of the rest of this learning path escalates far too quickly. 1. parallelism can wait. 2. Interacting with sockets and basic network concepts should also wait. Instead introduce this world through interacting with HTTP/HTTPS through something like the requests library. People are already familiar with the web. 3. Set expectations properly: "When you write a ~~networking~~ *any* program, ~~sometimes~~ your program will *rarely* work at the first time. But *usually* ~~sometimes~~ it won’t." 4. Let's learn a little more before we start practicing for our first interview. This also implies that the primary purpose of learning a coding language is to get work as a coder in that language. Coding is a skill for anyone in just about any professional setting. &amp;#x200B; Also, libraries and frameworks are not an optional part of learning a language like python and should be introduced far earlier. Learning to leverage the work to solve common problems done by others doesn't take away from the overall learning experience. Asking a student to reinvent a wheel that was invented long ago is not an effective approach. I still remember a conversation with my CS professor when I asked why he insisted that the class implement their own printf on their first C assignment. "Thats the way I learned to do it" was the answer, the worst of all answers. Take a look at the article linked at the bottom, "Top Steps to Learning Python the Right Way". Its approach is more appropriate.
Pretty much all newer devices are using USB-C. While not all are necessarily there yet, I would assume that it would be the case during this Pi's lifetime. All my devices run USB C, plus my laptop has one C port that I use for a second monitor. Now I just need to figure out what the hell to do with all these USB micro cables I have.
You forgot to link to your favorite networking book
Personally, i find it harder for people to understand what green threads are doing then for async. For those who don't understand, it's far to easy too as in a library that either isn't supported, or you just don't monkey patch, and it stalls the event loop. We least with asyncio, your are aware everything had to be compatible, whereas with green threads it might not be obvious they are even being used.
Yes, you can.
So how did they learn eloctomagnetism or gravitation without calculus. I think learning scientific programming with python is your safest bet and you can implement what you think the book lacks with other books. I did that with cfd books so i think its feasable. That s what i think.
Keeping code snippets short is very good advice. Someone new to the language, or coding in general, tends to try to consume it all at once, and get frustrated, rather than mentally break longer examples into sections the way a more experienced eye would.
But wouldnt you need to edit the function itself?
The files take 4 hours to download for me. Is there another way to view them?
But *how*? I’m not sure if it’s the `name=` attribute in the `setuptools.setup()` call or the subdirectory name inside the package directory that should be changed, and in which way.
The former.
Sounds interesting. I have none projects at the moment, so I think I can help you.
Nice work and initiative, but I really miss an overview. Also, at the point you wrote "If you are coming from a different programming language, then you should skip to level 1." there should be a link or something so that you actually *can* skip to it. Scrolling gets old really fast.
If you have some interesting ideas in mind, then I would like to join.
Super cool. How many planets have been found so far with TESS?
I am going to say that it is entirely impossible. This is because your encrypted value is actually just a completely random string. This is due to this line: encrypted_letter_as_number += random.randint( ASCII_MIN - encrypted_letter_as_number, ASCII_MAX - encrypted_letter_as_number ) This is the equivalent of: encrypted_letter_as_number = encrypted_letter_as_number + random.randint( ASCII_MIN, ASCII_MAX) - encrypted_letter_as_number Which is the same as: encrypted_letter_as_number = random.randint( ASCII_MIN, ASCII_MAX)

Thanks again for your help. I tried IRC and didn't get very far. But that led me down a path that led to [this post and, finally!, a solution](https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxquestions/comments/c5wxh0/help_with_error_on_install_of_python37_from/es62261/) thanks again!
Wow, right! Haha I tried to solve it myself but couldn't. I'll update the script, thanks!
It is the strongest book I've seen this far and your suggestion might indeed be what we end up doing. However, the examples are not relevant for a large amount of the participants. For example, clinical biologists that did not learn calculus but need Python for data analysis. Our biggest challenge is to make the course available (and relevant) for students in a vast array of sciences, from engineering to biology and economics, which is why we want a book (or two) with a broader focus than just the mathematical sciences.

As of right now 31. There are a lot more planet candidates but they have to be confirmed by other telescopes. You can look at the parameters and perform searches on confirmed planets [here](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/cgi-bin/TblView/nph-tblView?app=ExoTbls&amp;config=planets&amp;constraint=pl_facility%20like%20%27Transiting%20Exoplanet%20Survey%20Satellite%20(TESS)%27) Since this is r/python if anyone wants to do home-brewed science you can look at the python package [lightkurve](https://github.com/KeplerGO/lightkurve)
No... Software development is a highly compensated skill in the US, and that's info you could have easily learned with a quick Google search. I consider myself to have intermediate Python knowledge (been a dev working primarily with Python for 2 years) and, while I'm not paid hourly, I effectively make $136/hr, which is likely an order of magnitude more than the average temp.
You're producing lists, not arrays. And a list of lists, not a 2D array. There are differences.
I didn't read the tutorials, but in my experience in teaching hs kids if you don't start with a repl as an advanced calculator and then do some turtle stuff you loose half the class before ever talking about classes. Of course the demographic is different enough that it might be different. Idk.
Im sorry for that, if you want to watch onlineyou have to buy this packagefrom udem . But in future we do it for free.
Been seeing some buzz around this. Will be *awesome* if it gets to where it says it's going. Right now, it sounds like it only covers the "simple" cases already covered by py2exe, pyinstaller, cx_freeze and so on: if pygame, pyqt, matplotlib and so on start working, then I'll be excited. The author states that it can be used for packaging rust in python projects: I would be interested to know how that function overlaps with pyo3 and its derivatives setuptools_rust and pyo3-pack.
Wait, could I write Rust code in Python with this? &gt; While solving packaging and distribution problems is the primary goal of PyOxidizer, a side-effect of solving that problem with Rust is that PyOxidizer can serve as a bridge between these two languages. PyOxidizer can be used to easily add a Python interpreter to any Rust project. But the opposite is also true: PyOxidizer can also be used to add Rust to Python.
Maybe I misunderstood you. If you are asking how gevent switches during IO, it provides alternate versions of the low-level IO operations, like `socket.read()` that switch to the event loop. asyncio does the same thing. Anything that calls gevent's versions of these functions can run asynchronously. You can force other libraries to use them with monkey-patching, even if the other libraries were never designed to run that way. This is how you avoid having to edit any other code. Some people find monkey-patching scary, but if you take care to do it right it works very well.
Closed issues doesnt mean they have been solved noone care to reply doesnt mean it doesnt exist. Try to search more issues or type it yourself with super() and click on method or even compare to Pycharm to know does it work or not if you aren’t nut.
That's perfectly understandable. I was ok with the concept of asyncio initially for the argument that it would help people, especially beginners, understand async IO. Python is a learning language, after all. But then I read posts like this one: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/brdm2k/how_to_retrieve_100k_objects_with_python_why_we/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/brdm2k/how_to_retrieve_100k_objects_with_python_why_we/), which tell me that despite the explicitness, asyncio may actually be making it harder to understand async IO. Personally, I don't find it very hard at all to see where IO is happening. `requests.get()`? IO. `requests.cookies.get()`? Not IO. I know that's partly experience, and a big part API design. As for blocking calls, there are other ways to find them that don't require you to rewrite everything.
If you are learning to code, I recommend just using python
Coderun
Code run uses the Integrated terminal and main point I can't use it is that you have to close the previous program completely before starting another.

What a fantastically constructive criticism. Well done.
Anaconda is nice because it simplifies the install of packages and it’s numpy is 4x faster than stock numpy on Windows. Spyder is just an IDE and while it’s built for Matlab converts and does a decent job, it’s not necessary to use it. Everyone has their own favorite IDE. Especially for beginners, I recommend it. It just works.
Hard lot of part involved, master each subject to not learn in a complete mess.
So IDE’s are just where u type code right? The overall python language is the same whether ur using spyder or any other Python IDE? And by “it” you mean that you recommend spyder?
Sounds interesting! Care to share what website(s) you're scraping?
Hey! Check yourself. Your dick's on fire.
I like this, clean and simple. My only issue with anything like this is I use PyCharm for all my work and jumping over to terminal to kick this off and commit is an annoyance. Any recommendations on a clean integration?
Yes, the IDE is just what you type code into. Some have automatic error checking. Some have debuggers. Some have vi key bindings or dark themes. Pick your favorite. Spyder is decent, but it’s not my favorite, which is WingIDE. It costs money though. Other people like PyCharm, which also costs money. Both have free versions, but those are not as good. Also, add Anaconda to your path. They don’t do it by default because it can mess up the path. Can, but most of the time doesn’t, but they don’t want that responsibility/blame. Neither does the regular python install.
You dont need to switch to terminal for all these. I set this up and before committing, I just run ```pre-commit run -a``` on the integrated terminal of my IDE and that runs all the hooks. Then I commit via pycharm or vscode as I'm used to. This is one extra step but can save a lot of trouble.
Do you have a degree? By intermediate, I meant fresh diploma holder in IT. Starting temp pay here is from $7 to maybe $10. Full time is from $14-$17 but not easy to get. I guess cheap Indian IT worker bring the salary down here. $136 is a crazy number
The theorem is preventing me from understanding the code.
Say you want to draw a map. Map of the Earth, map of an arbitrary fantasy planet, whatever. And you want to color the countries on these maps. You don't want two countries that have a common border to share the same color, because that would look stupid and it would be hard to differentiate them. Then four different colors are enough to avoid this situation. This is true for an arbitrary number of countries with an arbitrary number of borders and also applies to the background (so I guess the oceans if you want to draw a map of Earth). That's basically what the four color theorem says. ... at least I hope so, I'm not a mathematician. But that's how I understand it. :) The code basically applies this theorem to whatever map you feed it (i.e. it colors your map with four colors, and not more).
Jira is killing me slowly... every day.
I see so many people with the same complaint, it's just a huge app now and large people are moving away.
You can also integrate black into PyCharm using file watchers. Just add a file watcher for Python files that runs black with argument `$FilePath$` and it will reformat each file on save. (By default every time you leave the frame or when pressing Ctrl+S.)
 I do! Lets do it! 😝
Hey, thanks for the gold badge (I assume it was you) I'm happy that you got it sorted out! Pip's no longer puking and all? Happy Pythoning!
I feel like (unit) testing should also be part of this. I have no experience in that, but I had almost decided that that would be my next step. This article and you not mentioning that at all makes me doubt. Where should the place of testing be in your opinion, if at all?
Yep, that's the idea. IDE stands for Integrated Development Environment by the way. So it's basically what you use to write and run your Python code, but it still stays Python. You have some that are pretty different, like Jupyter Notebook, where you can run your code by what they call 'cells', which are just blocks of code, that you can run independantly and in any order (which makes it tricky sometimes), or more conventional ones like Spyder or PyCharm. Usually people like one over another because of some features, like auto-complete or being able to quickly change a variable's name across a code. I would really recommend Spyder to start. What I really like about it, is that you have a variable visualiser, which can be really helpful when trying to debug, and just learning in general. It allows you to quickly have a look at what is stored in a variable, and what type it is. I still consider myself new to Python, but I started on Spyder, and really loved it!
I'm not a dev by trade. I'm an IT technician. I do the dev stuff to make my job easier

It is and I don't know why anyone is paying someone with 2 years experience $136 an hour to program in Python. This would be almost a $300,000 yearly salary! I call nonsense.

It was really a great feeling seeing someone else manually counting the ignitions (basically we have a pulse every 7 sec, and we need to check that it actually works each time to know the reliability), then turn towards me and be like: "hey, you can code right? Why don't you make find a way to do that?" And 2 days later, bam! I'm so proud of how clumsy that looks, a webcam, some LEGO, a cardboard and that's all you need! :-) People in aerospace aren't the best programmers in the world, so even if this is pretty basic, it's great to see how a bit of programming skills can be applied in so many different scenarios!
If indentation is really an issue for you I’d scale down the scope of that project a bit, cause you need r/learnpython.
Yea code is in everything now. Python is really easy to pick up and code with also. That is one of the things I love about it.
Interesting, I like this and will give it a try. Current projects it could reck havoc so I wonder if there is a diff checker. &amp;#x200B; Thanks!
Definitely! Though this does require knowing some specific libraries depending on the problem, what I really like is how open most of it is. You don't have to pay to run your code, anybody can pick it up and use it. Also working with some hardware limits were interesting. In this case, the webcam I'm using is a 720p 30fps webcam, but my laptop couldn't process it at 30fps, but rather 15. After about 20h it went down to about 12 or 10 (probably due to some really poor coding choices of mine AMD basically 0 optimization), which made it pretty interesting to figure out how to handle in order to find the actual distribution of successful ignitions over time, as I was counting per frame. I really think these types of problems are super easy to come up against and are great ways to learn about solving issues with limited resources. Just to say, I totally agree, this thing is awesome!
probably not "shodan.io" but it could be nice to collect fligths data.
True.
Ahh I see the need for python haha. My current employer actually hired me for a completely different position but liked me because of programming. All the random ass odd jobs they wanted me to do, I would just start automating and now they just have me automating all the manual stuff in my company.
exactly!, as I wrote [in a github issue](https://github.com/indygreg/PyOxidizer/issues/27) , hello world apps dont add any value to the existing status of python app packaging.
I code with python as hobby for years now. But I never felt being good since I always learned things as I needed them. I mostly don't need advanced things either since I don't code for a living. I feel this will help me improve. Although I plan on learning different languages python is an important language to master and have on the side.
its a good restart
idk why i associate pycharm with mac computers
Sorry, to clarify I have 5 years professional experience. 3 years as a consultant doing some non-Python coding (mainly small internal tools, not true app dev), and then the last 2 years doing application development and data engineering in Python. My total comp this year will be $245k, so that comes out to about $136/hr assuming 1800 hours worked, which is 45 40-hour work weeks (I get 7 weeks paid time off annually inclusive of vacation days, sick days, and paid holidays). I also live in one of the highest cost of living cities in the world, so that certainly affects my pay as well. 6 months ago, I was doing similar work with similar experience in a medium cost of living city, and was earning less than half of what I make now. I also work in an industry known for high compensation, though I have friends with similar experience at top tech companies (Google, etc.) bringing home $300k+ (feel free to look at /r/cscareerquestions salary sharing threads to see tons of data points supporting this), so I'm not quite at the far end of the spectrum either. Believe me or don't, it doesn't really matter, my point was simply to say that learning software development using Python is certainly a skill far more valuable than +$1/hr over minimum wage.

Haha Though, say that to my advisor. Not sure he agrees.
That make sense
Nope, but I use venv instead (shipped with python) which seems to do what it should be doing.
Database. I like pandas a lot, but it should never be used just as a substitute for a database when storing/querying data. Especially not in production. However, if you're just passing relatively small amounts data around, why not just use JSON or another commonly-uses data interchange format?
Thank you! I assumed perhaps incorrectly that passing json between internal modules might be overkill - but if that’s more efficient and scalable, then I’ll certainly take a look at that
Super smart observations. I'm a rookie to coding after being out of the hobby for 30+ years. I'm learning Python as a way to automate or enhance my work on the web as well as in CG projects. It's still Greek to me but the fundamentals are close to what I learned in Basic, back in the 80s. I'm giving this Step by Step article a shot as reinforcement of what I'm currently learning about Python.
&gt; temporary data (5 I'd recommend using something lightweight such as a sqlite database if you were dealing with a decent amount of records. However, 500 rows max is super small, so you'd likely not see performance issues using pandas in production vs. using a database, and you may not want another dependency especially if you're already using pandas for data munging.
ruamel.yaml doesn't have a name like PyYAML to propel it to the top but is much better. Covers more of the spec, more secure, faster, ...
Is this being sent over some network connectiong, or just through internal calls. Internal calls, dataframe is fine. Over network, probably serialize it to json for the transfer.
Unit testing as a teaching tool is a fantastic idea.

Yep! Pickling it for now. Thank for the JSON suggestion, I am going to go with that

Try conda or anaconda
Well that makes me feel inadequate, with a card board box too. Salt on the wound.
Any luck? Usually depends on what packages are included with what you've set as your project interpreter. Also, I've had issues in the past with python on Windows, but it's gotten better recently as I've moved more towards Anaconda.
Lol, I'm actually working on that data also.
What is the app supposed to do? It's unclear
Say what you like about Legos, at least anything you construct from them will have A) predictable tolerances, and B) reproducibility. :)
Remarkable initiative, but debatable interpretation. I like choice of introducing objects right away, but it's a big dead end. Variables, conditionals and other basic are introduced very nicely, but then, when talking about classes, it slams users with links to Wikipedia as a way to practice inheritance. I can see a novice getting really frustrated after getting his hopes up when reading the first parts. Would be great to see such a resource improving.
pandas is great for modeling, but if you're really crunching some numbers, you might considering re-implementing your model with a different language also, yes. database

Good example of Python Twitter application, will be my starting point for Natural Language Sentiment Analysis.
If I'm reading this correctly, you can implement a python REPL and interpreter into a rust application. The rust app can read and execute the python source. Which makes sense cus I read a rust Medium a while ago talking about it.
I wish I could share what I'm working on at work, it's cool, but not for sharing here. On the side I'm working on visualizing some geographic data. Basically its a bunch of (about 250) latitude and longitude tuple . First pass shows them on a map: &amp;#x200B; I'm still amazed at how easy it is to create really good looking visualizations of geographic data with MatPlotLib and Basemap. The background image here is provided by arcgisimage and the World\_Shaded\_Relief service. Next step is to add another dimension to that data by color coding it. That requires finishing some code that reverse geocodes each coordinate then looks up some meta data based on that. Like most geographic visualizations it ends up mostly showing where the population centers on, but once I add the third layer, boundaries of that meta data (in this case TV markets), then it gets more useful as a visualization.
I started to learn code a few days ago and came to say about explaining the #. This would have completely confused me a few days ago.
How did you recognize the ignitions?
You *embed* a python interpreter in the rust application. You don't have to implement it yourself.
Fair enough. Thank you for the correction.
It's not a joke when some facilities has 30+ year old equipment that's heald together with ducktejp and teporary (reed permanent) jerry-rigged mountings. If it works it works, dont fix it. XD

Take 30 min to learn how to use conda for managing your Python environment. It will pay off almost immediately.

 I was originally planing to make a website to allow the public to play spy by encrypting stuff in images text and videos although I am going for a limited one as mypython coding for indention isn't the best and debugging with a few days left.
Downloaded all the videos woo hoo. Going to watch it.
Ron Jeremy?
Since you've seemingly aimed this at beginners, and I'm a beginner, I'm going to critique this based upon my impressions of this article as someone who falls into your targeted audience. The main problem I had w/ your article was not the content so much as how it was presented, and I felt that you went directly against your stated premise. You wrote, "The best way to learn Python is to understand the big picture of all what you need to learn **before** you dive in and start learning." From this antecedent statement, I think that it would be reasonable to surmise that you planned on covering the over-arching premises of Python, object-oriented programming, goals that can be accomplished by learning to code, etc. However, in *Level 0: The Beginnings* of your article, you dive directly into the nitty-gritty of the language: Variables, Data Types, Operations, Conditionals, and Functions. I don't see how this is any different than any other tutorial on the topic. Given your opening assertion about what's required before commencing learning coding and the fact that you labeled this *Level 0: The Beginnings*, (an expected precursor to the actual content of the language, if you will), I'm failing to understand why there's no "big picture" discussion. As I previously mentioned, I understand the content well enough to know that the concepts presented here can be conveyed across other programming languages, as well, but this just didn't seem to match w/ your presumptory premise. Delving into *Level 1: Object-Oriented Programming*, I noticed a peculiar graphic, one relating to automobiles, makes, and models. At first glance, I thought, 'O.k., this graphic might be used to communicate the idea of object-oriented programming, but I'm confused about the content of the graphic.' The graphic contains what I assumed were two makes of automobiles: Minis and Hondas. I say assumed, b/c I really wasn't familiar w/ Minis. Sure, I'd heard of them, but it's not like using a much more recognizable auto-maker, such as Mercedes, Lexus, or Volkswagen. As I came to find out, a Mini was a type of automobile made by another manufacturer, which confused the graphic even more. Why did Mini seem to be on the same level as Honda in the image? Why wasn't the manufacturer of the Mini placed above them in the tree-structure, the same way that Honda was placed above the Civic and/or the Accord. I found these questions to be distracting and confusing, as I was attempting to discern what information you were attempting to put across w/ what appeared to be an exemplary image of the distinction of objects. At this point, I could only assume that what I was seeing in the image would be covered in the text, and hopefully, my questions would be answered, and I would come to understand the basics of object-oriented programming. But, before I get to that, you wrote, "Everything in Python is an object," and then posed the question, "...what exactly is an object?" You followed that w/, "In object-oriented programming, an *object* refers to a particular instance of a *class*." This statement indicates that there are multiple types of classes, and one of these types is an object. If this is true, then "everything in Python" wouldn't be an object. Instead, an object would be but one type of class, and possibly, everything in Python might be a class. I don't think this is true, but this is how it comes across in the text. As I read further, instead of explaining the example in the image, you posed something altogether different. First, you stated, "...a **class** is like a blueprint of the *state* and *actions* that an object can take." You then proceeded to give an example of a person, their name, and age. The problem is, neither a person's name nor age are states or actions. They're traits. In the context of object-oriented programming, they may be states and/or actions, but what I'm getting at is, there are much clearer examples that could've been utilized. As I read on, I realized that the image related to automobiles was never addressed anywhere in the text. I found this to be quite odd. Sure, it's possible to write an article, where an image requires no explanation nor caption. For instance, if I'm writing about basketball, and I use an image of Michael Jordan, even though he may not factor into the article at all, virtually everyone knows who he is and his relationship to the game. Therefore, no explanation is required. I can simply use it as a topical image. That's not the case here. You're supposedly offering something that's a different take on an esoteric subject. To employ an image, which purports to explain this very subject, then never refer to it in the text is, I feel, self-defeating. Given that I found the nature of the image, as well as the fact that it wasn't addressed in the article, a curious choice, I began to wonder if you'd created this graphic, or if you simply found it elsewhere online. Therefore, I decided to perform a reverse-image search on it, and I found this image only one other place online: [https://www.afternerd.com/blog/learn-python/](https://www.afternerd.com/blog/learn-python/) The image is found on another website w/in the same article, word-for-word, that you posted here today. The article on the other website was posted four months ago. Given that you have a brand-new Reddit user account, I'm wondering if you wrote the article that was originally posted to [afternerd.com](https://afternerd.com)? I ask, b/c you seemingly presented this material here today as something new.

Looks great, shame there's no way to do this currently (AFAIU) in linux.
I just bought that same webcam a few weeks ago for a some random python stuff
Can people stop talking about conda? It's not the same thing as pipenv at all. Pipenv breaks because pipenv is bad. It's doing half the job that poetry does, and not nearly as well; it offers few improvements and plenty of drawbacks over native virtual environments. Its best feature is wrapping pyenv, in which case... just use pyenv.
I personally find pre-commit a pain to use, but it's the recommended thing for black so I have it in a few repos. The main thing I want from it is to silently format my changed files and add those changes to the commit rather than just telling me it's had to format them. It doesn't save me any effort right now (I still have to remember to format stuff before I commit): it just shouts at me sooner if I forget. I get that if you were to stage chunks of files, formatting and re-staging would blow that away, but that's a pretty rare circumstance in my workflow.
I would say that if you've mastered data structures, flow control, functions *and* OOP, all in step one (!), you're no longer a beginner and you're way past the scope of this - very short - introductory article. Concurrency and sockets can wait, if you really need them at all. There are several other things I think woukd more useful to a beginner, I would suggest tests, virtualenvs, properties, and perhaps some advanced-ish OOP using magic methods.
\^ "NASA". Looks closer. Sees Chinese laptop and Han looking characters on tissue box. Non-americans can into space too my friend.
I think this is an improvement. Thanks for being so receptive to feedback.
There’s always a loophole. My intention was that you don’t, as a user, directly execute a YAML file. There’s no YAML interpreter, it’s just a parsed language that relies on other interpreters or runtimes to determine what to do. You could say the same thing about plaintext or JSON when using BASH/JavaScriptand their `eval` methods.
A couple more thoughts on PySimpleGUI, particularly examples. There is a primary Demo Program section on the GitHub. These over 100 Demo Programs are meant to teach you a bit about using PySimpleGUI on tkinter. But, these programs are not written with only PySimpleGUI-tkinter version in mind. Often you'll find another one or two PySimpleGUI ports imported in the same project, just commented out. The idea is you uncomment one import, comment out another. Then under each of the different ports you'll find more Demo Programs. Not as many as the primary one, but still there's a good number of bits of code to use as scrap to get you started or give you ideas. It's fun is being able to try out all of these different platforms to determine which you like best, without having to make major changes to your source code. It's a write once, run in many environments kind of package. For example, today checked into GitHub a version of the Pong program that runs on both tkinter and in a web page.
This seems great. Didnt you put it in a github proyect page?
What's on the breadboard.
As someone who has hired a number of developers, including a number of Python developers, certificates meant nothing to me. There is no certificate or degree that I found gave me any signal into whether a person was qualified for the job. Your mileage may vary. I am in Seattle and so employers in your area may behave differently.

For those interested in this area (app distribution) please take a look at PyUpdater. It’s incredible.
Anaconda will save you massive headaches particularly when you want to do something simple and it requires the install of a package that might otherwise take you days to get the dependencies correct on a vanilla installation of python. Anaconda has basically everything built in that you could want for sci/eng work and it's easy to use conda to get additional packaging. I would start with this. Don't bother with virtual environments (some may suggest it) as it would just lead to confusion in the beginning.

This is relatively simple. Familiarize yourself with the discord.py package. Just remember that you want to use as many non-blocking methods as possible. You will need a way to persistently store the data. Aiosqlite is a package that could work if you think the frequency of the words will be low. If you want to risk volatility you could try storing in JSON, but I recommend avoiding that. Postrgres or mysql is probably overkill unless your server has 200+ users. But you would want to find the relevant async packages for either if you decide you do need it. You could join the discord.py discord channel as well. So long as you have most of the codebase they will help you.
There are a lot of musician/coders who have demoscene / game development background. I would look from some reddit groups related to those.
Has anybody had success with this?
Hi, there is a misunderstanding about sleep proxy, when a computer goes sleep all process in memory are migrate to disk, so there is no process running on operating system. But is possible to run a script in background if you using any Unix like appending &amp; at the end of your python script.

I recently started doing both music and coding. I've tried learning them both in the past but I wasn't as serious as I am now. I'm working on a hard-coded song generator right now ([source code](https://github.com/Sanseer/Robatim)). I've seen a few machine learning attempts at music generation that were underwhelming so I thought I would try to manually create one. My program tries to follow the rules of counterpoint and the conventions of a classical style. Through this project, I'm starting to think music is a great example of OOP. &amp;#x200B; I don't think I would be able to help you out on your project since I'm still a beginner in both music and coding. But I would be interested in learning more about it.
GNU/Lego
I watched this waiting for ignition flashes for way too long before realizing its not a gif...
Hahaha, sorry buddy
That's super specific indeed haha Though, I don't think this applies, the picture shows the webcam looking into the vacuum chamber, so we can't technically see the engine stand in this picture. We can see the engine-reliability-sensor-stand (fancy word for webcam LEGO stand) though. Don't know if there's a subreddit for that? :P
Engineering require multiple talents, I guess ;)
I honestly don't. I can see why this is fulfilling a needed gap. I think, though, it's really easy to roll your own with a redis backend or something similar. I should make a blog-post I guess?
Would love to read more details and/or help if I can.
Is that called Recursive Python?
Sounds like a Pulsed Plasma Truster or something similar. What's the mechanism here?
I'm sorry to bother you again, but I'm not sure how to get this running. More specifically, I'm not sure how the authentication process works. With tweepy, it was quite straightforward. You pretty much just enter your app credentials and then continue with what you want. I can't really figure out how to get the Google photos API running, especially for someone who's new to the whole concept. Again, thanks.
In a nutshell, the way the thruster works is by creating a big discharge of current through 2 electrodes (basically a big spark). To initiate it, we have a sparkplug creating an initial smaller spark (just like in your car engine, the sparkplug is here to initiate a bigger explosion (for the car), discharge for my case). This initial spark will create a conductive zone between my two electrodes, that will discharge through the electrodes a set of capacitors storing some energy. This leads to a big spark, just like a lightning actually, except this is controlled (well... just take my word for it) .So what I'm expecting to see is a big flash of light if it's successful, hence the cardboard, to block all the light the webcam is receiving, and only see what's going inside the vacuum chamber. I'm using OpenCV to do some very basic image processing, turning the image into gray scale (I only care about brightness, not color) and applying a mask so that only pixels above a certain value are seen. Then, for each frame, I'm calculating the average pixel brightness across the image. When nothing happens, thanks to the cardboard + mask, the video sees only black, so 0 pixel brightness across the image. As soon as I have a discharge, as I said, big flash of light. So the average brightness goes up. For each frame, I calculate the difference in average with the previous frame (to check for increase in brightness). If that's above a certain threshold, it stores that as a discharge (as a 1), otherwise not (and stores a 0 for that frame). The difference is done so that it only counts a discharge ones, and not on multiple frames (I basically only count the initial increase in brightness, and not all the frames where the brightness is above a threshold. That would have made it count the same discharge multiple times otherwise). In the end I have a big list with 0s and 1s of discharges and non discharges. I'm also storing the number of frames I can process per second (which is not constant due to non existing optimization due to my lack of coding skills, and a limited laptop), so that I can not only count how many discharges I have in total, but also plot how many I had over time, which allows me to see precisely how reliable the thruster is over time. Valuable data that I would not have otherwise! I hope that makes it clear enough :)
Well, kinda yeah haha But in this case, the cardboard is only here to keep the light out, there aren't any structural loads taken by the cardboard, if that reassures you :P
Lets practice together through google hangouts! 💭
Hey, my name is "haizek haze" message me!
Xiaomi mi Notebook pro! Love this laptop! i5 8th gen, my 150 GPU, 8Gn of RAM. Not a beast, but I bought it 685€ last year, it weighs 2kg and has a massive 10h battery life thanks to that low power i5. Never found anything better bang for buck! Sure it's a MacBook clone, but I don't care, it looks great. The back has no logo or anything on it, it looks so sleek, just that aluminum finish on it. It's not that powerful, with the mx150, but I can push some AAA games on it when sacrificing quality. It's also good for very light neural network training when I need to do it locally. I definitely recommend it! We don't hear much about it from EN speaking reviewers because it's sold in China and has a Chinese Windows version. A clean reinstall and it's good to go.
Basically all of it! I did the design choices, the CAD, sent it to manufacturing, and tested it! I wasn't 100% alone in the decisions of course, but I made it from scratch :) To be honest it's just 2 electrodes and some extruded pieces of Teflon + a sparkplug, so that might sound way better than it actually is.
Definitely recommend it then! :P
Capacitors to make a voltage multiplier! Cockcroft Walton generator if you're interested :)
Of course there's duct tape! How do you think the cardboard holds together? Pff, thinking I'm not a real engineer or what? (Couldn't tick the WD40 box though, I feel ashamed of myself)
Haha, I wish I could upvote that more than once.
To level it with the glass opening of the vacuum chamber, and set the webcam at the same height as the thruster inside.
i'm certain that they will appreciate your content
Never underestimate the power of duct tape in the hands of someone in need.
Not sure if your kidding because they're pretty ubiquitous. They are a set of interlocking plastic bricks used to build stuff. They're typically for children. [Click here for more info](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego)(en.wikipedia.org)
**Lego** Lego ( LEG-oh, Danish: [ˈleːko]; stylised as LEGO) is a line of plastic construction toys that are manufactured by The Lego Group, a privately held company based in Billund, Denmark. The company's flagship product, Lego, consists of colourful interlocking plastic bricks accompanying an array of gears, figurines called minifigures, and various other parts. Lego pieces can be assembled and connected in many ways to construct objects, including vehicles, buildings, and working robots. Anything constructed can be taken apart again, and the pieces reused to make new things.The Lego Group began manufacturing the interlocking toy bricks in 1949. *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Python/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28
Well I'm a French guy using a Chinese laptop working in Taiwan for this. So yeah, NASA isn't on board here. But on a more serious note, I'm all for international cooperation, and I think what most people aren't aware of is that a lot of people working in these national agencies come from all over the world. Some of the best engineers at NASA weren't originally Americans (most famous and controversial being Verner Von Braun, who lead the development of the Saturn V, and the V2s), a lot of people in Роскосмос in Russia come from previous USSR countries, a lot of people at ESA come from outside Europe, you get the idea. Which, I think is great. Because once we go up there, you can't really see those borders anymore :-)
No I was just adding to the other comments on incorrect pluralisation of Lego.
r/woooosh
You’d need an IQ of 300, to come up with that idea. XD
then he answered the question like one below you(as of 9:28 EST 6/27/2019)
I made a rudimentary media player with Python. Probably not what you're interested in tho. What exactly is this project you want to start?
I uploaded the code on gitlab, so I can gladly share that if people are interested :) It's very far from perfect, but it works. I didn't take it past the "it does what I want" part, and try to improve the code, since I had other things to do, but if people want to take a look, I'd be more than happy to share that! :D
You should ask questions like this in /r/learnpython. Also note that you should not post images of code. See the FAQ in /r/learnpython which shows you ways to quote code. You need to print a "newline" character to get a new line. You get an automatic newline at the end of the data you print when using the `print()` statement, so you could do: print('eeee') print() print('hehe') You can also put the "escape sequence" `\n`into a string which causes a newline to be printed instead the `\n`: print('eeee\n\nhehe")
Yep! Pulsed Plasma Thruster, that's exactly it! My thesis is on looking at the influence of divergent nozzles. So while it wasn't originally planned, I used this to measure reliability and compare how each nozzle configuration had an effect on how well and how long the thruster was able to successfully sustain a high discharge rate.
You can make use of a string formatter to have multiple values as your input. See this example below; &gt;&gt;&gt; answer = input("{}{}{}{}".format("eee","\n","hee","\n")) eee hee haha &gt;&gt;&gt; answer 'haha' &gt;&gt;&gt;
I might post it there and see how it's received then! :)
Great. Now learn how to reddit.
Lol oops
Absolutely not! You try it once, go: "oh damn, I need the webcam way higher to actually *see* what's going on inside the vacuum chamber". There were some LEGO lying around (actually to make stands inside the vacuum chamber, which side note, is a terrible idea, don't do that) so tadaaa!

'They're typically for children' That's just a lame excuse for parents to buy them for their kids, and then actually play with them, we all know that. Or, well, use them to make a custom stand for your webcam.
I employed one operating a testbed satellite on orbit. Turns out PPT's kinda suck and use waaaaaaay too much juice for a small EPSA-class satellite to sustain long enough to get a meaningful effect. Then again, that's probably 20 year old tech at this point. At least in that configuration.
Fair enough OP
Correct!
Yep, totally aware of that. But, a man's gotta do with what he has to get his thesis! And some people are actually coming back to them, as we've had imporvement in circuit designs. They're more looked at for orbit maintenance and attitude control rather than orbit changing though, because of those flaws.
Ok why don't you enlighten me?
Again, just poking fun at the flawed "America = best" mentality. Your work is impressive and international collaboration is a wonderful addition to scientific endeavour, nationalism is not. I applaud your innovative use of available tools in it's many layers.
A couple micronewtons on a Geosync/stationary sat might make sense... if it had near constant sunlight and a large battery. Can't imagine it would be *that* effective though. Hope i'm wrong. We had an old engineering test unit for ground testing. Whenever we had kids by to take a tour, we'd talk about it, point it at em, and fire it. Always made em jump.
Never, ever pickle something that you can send as JSON instead. It's *slightly* faster, much less compatible between languages or even updates to your own code, and deserialising a pickle gives whoever wrote it arbitrary code execution on your machine. There are use-cases that deserve pickle, but none that don't involve considering JSON first!
Oh definitely, these things are really terrible in terms of efficiency. But you know, we're doing this 'for science'.
...when the computer goes to sleep \*nothing\* runs.
Looking at the YAML spec, this is not unexpected. Aliases are how YAML represents a graph structure. `tempalte_dict` is parsed once, and the instances of `*tempalte_dict` refer back to that same node instance.
It is very weird to suggest using string formatting in this way. Even if you wanted to allow for the "eee" and "hee" to be variables in the future, it would be much more common to do `"{}\n{}\n".format("eee", "hee")`
IIRC, the only benefit was the Specific Impulse. In Geo, every gram counts. Panels can make enough power to run something. But fuel? Fuel is hard.
We've got the same laptop! Do you have the fan problem though? I've been experiencing it intermittently and it really pisses me off.
Most electric thrusters now are being developped for CubeSats, so LEO, GEO isn't as much of an interest as it used to. Satellites are becoming increasingly smaller, which makes every gram count even more! Fuel is where these trusters shine, becuase they use very little of it. PPTs are great for their simplicity, it's just 2 electrodes and a Telfon block in between. So the fuel is solid, no need for pressurized tanks and valves. That's a huge appeal.
/r/learnpython read the sidebar google first

What are your laptop specs?
Sometimes it feels like there's something stuck in one of the fans, and as soon as I lift it up, a big noise happens, as if some paper went through the fan. I checked it twise, never got to solve the issue. But when running, I don't have any problems what so ever, it's only when I move it that it makes that sound.

Dare I say coders who are also musicians are more common than musicians who are also coders. It's a lifestyle. That said there's a band called The Algorithm IIRC that infuses both subcultures that's pretty dope.
Geez yeah hardware should be pushing more than 15, so I guess you’re right, it could be your code or optmz.
Yep, but I worked around it, so it's not really an issue, and 10fps is enough to spot reliably all the discharges.

Could you copy/paste the error? I think I’m reading your code wrong because it seems to me like you’re trying to access indexes that doesn’t exist. (-1 and -2)
ok I thought indexes -1 where the last element (the biggest one now cause of sort) and -2; the second biggest because of sort Leetcode simply says syntax error I don't know not saying anything else.
From October 2014
Also rewrote it like this: class Solution(object): def dominantIndex(self, nums): max_index = 0 for i in range(0,len(nums)): if (max_index != i and nums[max_index] &lt; (2 * nums[i])): return -1 for i in range(0,len(nums)): if nums[i] &gt; max_index: max_index = i Now this is giving me the second biggest value not the biggest don't know why.
It could be I haven’t ever used sort in python let me check the docs but it would seem strange for them to have it indexed that way as typically arrays start at zero.
Wd40 will come in during maintenance.
Oh, that's pretty cool! I mistook those for a bunch of blue LEDS lol
It seems you are right. It may be something with the way you call the sort method.
yea I'm a mess lol this is an easy problem thats the depressing part lol.

We don't support dataclasses yet, we are tracking support for it [in this issue](https://github.com/microsoft/python-language-server/issues/399), upvotes appreciated! We've got fairly extensive support for typing and have made many improvements in the paths few months so it sounds like you hit some bugs. Could you try again with the latest release, [file an issue](https://github.com/microsoft/python-language-server/blob/master/TROUBLESHOOTING.md#filing-an-issue) for the init method issue and type hinting cases so that we can take a look?
Yikes, dude. Look up list referencing in Python. This has nothing to do with sort. It's a negative index, which returns elements from the end, and works the same on all lists.
If you have the path to your python executable, you can setup a macro that executes your active Notepad++ script. This page will help. https://silentcrash.com/2016/12/run-python-script-notepad/
We've made big improvements to memory in the past month, on the order of a 4-5x reduction after analysis completes, but we still may have issues in some projects. Please check in the Python output panel what version of the language server you're using, if it is 0.3.20+ and you are still experiencing issues could you [file an issue](https://github.com/microsoft/python-language-server/blob/master/TROUBLESHOOTING.md#filing-an-issue) on our GitHub repo with more information about your project (e.g. the modules used)?

8 years of python experience. a year ago I did the jump to python3. Still struggling with print parens.
yes.
Given the packages you listed, no such tradeoff exists. Modern pypy releases already support those packages. &gt; pandas Explicitly supported since [PyPy 5.7 released several years ago](https://morepypy.blogspot.com/2017/10/pypy-v59-released-now-supports-pandas.html). &gt; scikit-image scikit-* has [experimentally supported pypy for over a year](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/11010).
wait. companies switched from python2 to go to avoid python3? I mean go is relatively feature rich and overall fun to code but I couldn’t imagine converting your python2 codebase to it when python3 exists. (unless the company already wanted to move over to a compiled language to address performance concerns)
This just seems so over-engineered. Why write a function, when you can just do: names = [employee['name'] for employee in data['employees']]

LEGOs are amazing and come in handy for so many things! The more I think about it, the more I see LEGOs as a hardware program langauge. Basic building blocks that you can assemble together to make things for all sorts of stuff.

That would be interesting. My idea was to use some int enums (2, 4, 8, 16,..) and or them together to indicate which permissions people have. Put it in my Postgres, then I can specify it in a JWT token. and JWT can be validated with zero DB reads too. :)
If the data acts as a cache of some sort go with Redis. You can make redis persistent too. Use SQL for relational data.

Hey, I've always wondered this. How small is your smallest impulse, say if you wanted to zero out a rotation of the sattelite, can you ever really bring that to a...stop?
Also this will have an error when the list is less than 2 or the second largest number is 0 Consider using multiplication instead of division
Since this is a pusled thruster, we don't take into account the pulse frequency (because changing the capacitors in the circuit would allow to change it, while the geometry of the thruster wouldn't) so we talk in N.s (thrust / frequency) In my case, my thruster is at 0.06x10^-6N.s That is really, really small. So depending on how much "to a stop" you actually want, you can fine tune it very very well Usually we have the other problem, which is not very low reactivity.

In my opinion pipenv is cool idea but it is yet not production ready. It is slow and cause problems. It's better still to stick to pyenv and use requirements.txt. After all pyenv is really great imo.

This is more about reverse engineering than it is about python, not sure if this is true, but maybe the data is protobuf, when you use this tool: [https://github.com/jmendeth/protobuf-inspector](https://github.com/jmendeth/protobuf-inspector) You get output like this: ``` % python2 main.py &lt; ../14 root: 100 &lt;32bit&gt; = 0x44A1D1F0 / 1151455728 / 1294.56 101 &lt;32bit&gt; = 0x00000000 / 0 / 0.00000 102 &lt;32bit&gt; = 0x00000000 / 0 / 0.00000 103 &lt;32bit&gt; = 0x400C5591 / 1074550161 / 2.19272 104 &lt;varint&gt; = 1561050417 105 &lt;varint&gt; = 1561051712 200 &lt;chunk&gt; = message: 1 &lt;chunk&gt; = "guntrap.deployed" 2 &lt;varint&gt; = 0 3 &lt;chunk&gt; = empty chunk 4 &lt;chunk&gt; = empty chunk 5 &lt;varint&gt; = 9 ``` Not sure if this makes any sense I always thought protobuf is useless without a proto file.
Maybe, if it makes sense at some point.

Wing 7 is nice. As you already know, it’s got some nice new features. My company upgraded from Wing 5 specifically because it supports type annotations and we just started moving to python 3. I had it before that because I got an open source license. Ultimately if you can get a customer to pay for it, that’s probably the way to go.

Thanks for the feedback. Been a user of wingide since 4.x , I too had an employer pay for my license for 4.x and 5.x and 6.x payed for itself by me doing python @work and on the side. The typeshed integration and code warnings seems to be the only killer feature I can see at this time compared to 6.x. The say remote agent debugging has been greatly improved but I never have had issues copying and editing wingdb stub and launching an ssh tunnel. I have not used 7.0.1 much yet, I can renew the 10 day trial another 2 times but yeah, I am leaning on just going to upgrade to give some support and help keep this great IDE alive.

the biggest challenge for me with serialization is getting the eager loading right when relationships need to be included such as with compound documents in json-api. does this help with that?
Yep. The example in the docs includes a case for that exactly. If you declare that you want to return a \`User\` with all his \`Item\`s, by declaring a Pydantic model for the user that contains the items, FastAPI will know to get those items from the user (e.g. like when you do \`user.items\`), by accessing the attribute, the ORM will fetch that data and populate it for you.
I find Wing 7 a bit frustrating. The typehint and mypy/pylint integration is nice, but the overall code introspection seems not quite as good as wing 6 yet. Sometimes wing 7 is inexplicably and temporarily unable to find the definition of an object, for example. The split reuse policy settings I prefer have also been broken for a long time (although maybe this was the case in wing 6 too, I forget). As usual the devs are super responsive and working to fix these issues, but I feel like 7 should have stayed in beta a bit longer. I work on a large and convoluted code base though, so I'm not sure how typical these issues are.

looks cool, i'll give it a go at some point!
that's not exactly what i'm asking. the problem is if you are serializing a list of users. returning 10 users would end up being 11 queries. where you could do it with eager loading in the query you would ultimately only have 2 queries regardless of the number of results in the first query. yes you can configure it on the model, however it's not always needed so better to let the front end specify the relationships they want returned kind of like what a graphql client would be doing.
How do you start your threads?
So how exactly does your numbering system work?
This is really cool, but also, why? Haha. Great job. Though I don't understand what time it is.
makes an excellent reference. thanks.
Ah, get it. Yep, but that is more dependent on the ORM itself. Each one handles that differently. What you could do is set the query parameters for how many relationships you want to query beforehand. But also, if it's ok for you to require the frontend to speak GraphQL and you don't need the other OpenAPI parts, using GraphQL might be a better fit for you, at least for those cases.
Gonna take risks to feel alive
graphql might be an option someday if we can ditch ember and ember data which speaks json-api unfortunately.
That's a very good question. I'll let you do the math, you have everything you need ;)
why are you still using python2 ?
Ah, in that case, this might be useful. But still, you would have to define in your code how to fetch the data. &amp;#x200B; This ORM mode will help to serialize and filter the data before returning it. But I guess the fetching from the DB would have to be done in your code, handling the specifics of your ORM.
Not op obviously but it reminds me of I think Mayan glyph numbers. If I’m understanding it correctly, it’s like a vertically stacked base-5 system? I only looked at the readme for less than a minute so I’ll delete this comment later if I’m wrong.
Thanks for the idea! Just posted there :)
Contact these people, they have worked on this extensively. Years ago I played quite a few hands against their vexbot heads up limit holdem and it was pretty good. Very aggressive but there were recognizable patterns after alot of hands. I am sure they have made some big progress. https://poker.cs.ualberta.ca/
Same as in reddit, put 4 spaces in front of every line to make it preformatted/like code. There's no reason to "View this file in 'Raw' form for clarity"; just format your [README.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/damienrigden/Sof-Dot-Project/master/README.md) properly. I'm gonna do a pull request for this; it's a pity to have such an interesting project and confuse people at hello! 🙂
Thanks for the advice, I’ll fix it. New to programming/GitHub so I’m still figuring stuff out. Glad you are interested in my project!
If you click on my source code link there is some documentation explaining it.
&gt;Hi JB. Thanks for your interest. Glad you like it. I got around it by not scraping from the UFC site, instead I scraped it from FightMetric and betmma.tips &gt; &gt;BeautifulSoup will have no issues on those site :) So I went to * [http://www.fightmetric.com/statistics/fighters](http://www.fightmetric.com/statistics/fighters), and it redirected me to [http://ufcstats.com/statistics/fighters](http://ufcstats.com/statistics/fighters) . * Tried to scrape there, but got: The page you have requested has been blocked, because the URL is banned. * Are you still able to web scrape today? JB
That looks amazing! Thank you so much for the help!
Just to make things worse, that's not just a container, that thing most hold 1 atm of pressure without collapsing, so it's a thick cylindrical box! Unfortunately the scales up law doesn't really hold up with what's inside, it "only" cost a few hundred bucks to manufacturer the thruster.
I am an artist and wanted a way to write the date on my work without distracting letters and numbers, so I came up with this system. I am learning programming and thought this would be a cool project to work on as a way to learn. I thought some people would be interested in the logic behind it and want to see it in action. You can think about this clock as more of an art project than a useful clock.
https://pypi.org/project/launchpad_py/
Sounds pretty fun! I think it's wonderful. It reminded me of Mayan (or Aztec?) numbers with the dots and lines. Was that part of the inspiration?
I'm hoping to finish up my first Selenium project that automates entry of dispatch orders onto our portal. I have the steps down, just need to work on loading the input data from a schedule template Google sheet. But I may pause to look at enlisting Beautiful Soup to help with the scraping--it takes a little while to loop through datatables looking for the right row to click. I could just have bad loops, but I want to learn BS anyway.
No honestly I just started drawing dots and it kind of just happened. I drew 4 dots and thought that was enough dots, added a bar and it just kind of logically progressed. Didn’t really have anything specifically in mind.
I wish I was that intelligent/creative. Great! Sometimes you just gotta go with the flow. I feel like any and all of my projects are very unoriginal, so I envy that ability. Cheers!
Great concept
I might be interested. How does Slack work?
fun fact for sockets in python, instead of creating a socket and the created a connection with that socket you can just do "my\_sock = socket.create\_connection((ip, port))" and it does all the work for you (:
No, virtual environments are not IDEs. They act like fresh environments where you have to install each package again. Useful if you need to make sure your code runs on different versions of the same package, or if you have several different packages that each require different versions of the same package. Again, it's confusing, so forget you heard that term.
&gt; perhaps I should delete and repost ? clearly
Following tutorials and reading books is cool and builds background but you kinda just gotta go for it at some point and make a cool ass project... I guarantee you will learn regardless of if the project works or not

What kind of larger, collaborative projects are you working on and how could a beginner help?
It’s a lil messy but —&gt; github.com/SethyRoosman/CNN-Scraper
We would help the beginner with that, I personally think that helping someone is collaborating. In the past we had couple members develop their personal Django projects and got help from our experienced members. We are always open to suggestions
It's an app like mirc(I don't know if you have heard this also) think it as a chat room on steroids
# Back End Engineer Bermi is a video sharing app trying to reinvent and democratize the way content is shared online. As it is now, you can create a meme that goes viral and is used by millions of people and you end up with exactly zero dollars to show for it, while online content providers serve ads and profit from your meme. It might seem silly to worry about memes but if someone creates content that ends up being enjoyed by millions, they should reap the rewards. We think so, anyway. &amp;#x200B; Bermi uses the fact that cryptocurrencies have the ability to provide small fractional transactions in order to compensate people for liking, sharing, and recommending content. We envision a new world where profits from online content creation aren't distributed to the publishing platform in a winner-take-all fashion. &amp;#x200B; *This opportunity is on-site, in New York City, and they sponsor H-1B applicants.* &amp;#x200B; **Company Size and Health** Bermi is VC funded and they are a true product company. All the engineers have impressive backgrounds, coming from great schools or other great tech companies. But we don't discriminate against people based on pedigree. We let the quality of your code do the talking for you. The team is around 14 people and mostly engineers. &amp;#x200B; Bermi's office is a beautiful penthouse in Wall Street. The building has a pool and the office has many amenities, including beautiful views of Manhattan, the Statue of Liberty, Ellis Island, New Jersey, and Brooklyn. Snacks and meals are provided. &amp;#x200B; Bermi's video sharing app has 500,000 daily active users, mostly in Latin America. The only way to have a steep career trajectory is by either founding your own successful startup or by joining one. Successful startups grow much faster than they can hire good talent, so naturally there are always opportunities for you to pick up slack and provide additional value if you are so inclined. If you fill a responsibility vacuum well, you will most likely get promoted into that role, and you can keep that going until you rise to the C suite. Joining a company like Bermi, full of brilliant minds, maximizes your chances of experiencing an explosive career trajectory. &amp;#x200B; **Open Position: Back End Engineer** We are looking for an experienced backend engineer to work on our high-traffic short video app and build a new social network around the world. You will be joining a stellar team with people from Google, Facebook, Bloomberg, Kayak, etc. &amp;#x200B; **Requirements:** * B.S. in Computer Science or related field (M.S. a plus) * 2+ years of backend engineering experience, ideally building products from ideation to launch on a strong engineering team. * Strong programming skills in Python * Strong understanding of modern back-end frameworks: Docker, Redis, AWS, etc. ***Nice to haves:*** * Knowledge of machine learning and recommendation engines * Cryptocurrency knowledge &amp;#x200B; Apply now at [https://codefor.cash/bermi-backend](https://codefor.cash/bermi-backend)

Just a fun programming challenge!
Take a look at Pygame and Godot. QT is more suited for making applications. It is possible to make a game in it, but if you need to hit the nail, a hammer is a better choice than a pair of pliers. Just my personal opinion.

Hmm, I see that this class is offered on Udemy but costs $13: https://www.udemy.com/learn-python-and-ethical-hacking-from-scratch/ Does this mean this is a pirated version?
It would be much easier to answer your question if the code was formatted. Indentation is very important in Python. Either precede your code lines with four spaces, use a fenced block or publish it somewhere.
i tried to space it out a bit
Can I be a mod??? haha I've never heard of this sub before
Try: `if name1 in ("Sarah", "Sarah V"):`
This Package bought with our group ( downloadly )- if anoyne cant pay for it we offer to download free .
Thank you
Last time i have seen PyGame, it's support was dropped. Was thinking about Godot though.
Looks neat! I submitted a small PR with some changes to the equality dunder methods since I saw some redundancy there. Not the greatest sin, but I had a minute to spare so I figured I'd do it :P
Thank you so much! :D
If Pygame is no longer maintained, don't bother. Godot does look quite good and can also do 3D if you ever want to go further with future projects.
My pleasure :)
This is really cool!
Sorry to tell you that, but if you already struggle with indentation, there is no way you'll make something like that in 3 days!
For the visuals matplotlib, plotly or seaborn might give you the visual easily. For sound as an input I am clueless.
Did you submit the pull request? I don’t have anything in my inbox to approve.
`name` exists inside the function's scope. Your `print` is outside of that scope therefore `name` is not defined. You need to capture the return from your function with `name = name_checker()`
Thanks!
Came here to make some comment about useless inventions but this is really cool man, hats off to you sir!

Haha thanks! It’s art, not solving anything other than saving us from our lack of amusement.
Approved! Thanks for the help.
Same as anything that supports markdown*
That's pretty awesome of you, mate! Cheers!
What time is it? 😄 Very good work!! 💪🏻
It's very nice. I would recommend setting autoflush = False, and flushing manually after changing each second, to have it all change together
um...what operating system? if it's Linux than using something like init.d or upstart is the usual way to do it. Dunno bout windows.
which os?

Thank you! It is counting up from like 9:58:45 AM to 10:00:15 AM in this video.
Cool I will look into this.
Thank you!
 \&gt;&gt; What time is it? &lt;&lt; Its almost dot dot dot horizontal line horizontal line 10 dots dash
Thanks, after I am through with standard library, definitely gonna check out.
Shouldn't be a problem, you just need to flush at the right spot. Think of it as follow: everything you draw and undraw is done in the background, and when you call "flush" it all apears together on the screen. Without too much scrutiny I would believe just putting a flush at the end of the while loop should work
No nee
Sounds good for games, but i still consider some small app making in the future, should i do Godot anyway?
Thanks, I am a beginner and the sayings like 'flat is better than nested', 'sparse is better than dense' didn't ring any bell. But now I kind of get it.
Ik got it extended
It's always more experience points :) So far, you probably don't know yet if you'll like it. Try Godot for games first. When you want to make an application or you decide Godot is not your cup of tea, try PyQt. In my opinion it's better to be familiar with many things, but specialise in few than specialise in few and have no clue about many other. But, I also may be wrong.
Awesomeness. Animations look shaky? Maybe you should some [easing formulae](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13462001/ease-in-and-ease-out-animation-formula).
Impressive credentials! I would like to apply as well.
Alright, that sounds really reasonable, i shall try the Godot and pick up Qt in case i don't like it or need to make an app ;) Thanks for your help man ;)
Cheers. I tend to err on the side of being (perhaps overly) verbose so relatively inexperienced people can follow along.
Sure, even though the "4 spaces before each line" isn't really standard. GitHub Flavored Markdown and Reddit's Snudown parser *do* have it, but technically code blocks are supposed to be marked by triple backquotes (`\`\`\``). Sort of. Markdown is a mess 🙂

I don't know if the library you are using supports it but there is something called double buffering that can stop the flickering
Nice, that would be very helpful. I’ll check it out. Thank you.
What do they do?
Since you’re using Windows, you could use Windows Task Scheduler. Then the script can be set up to run when the “startup” or “at logon” event occurs depending on your needs.
That's really weird then.
Please don't upset the Russians. We still need their RD-180 rocket engines. Thanks, the US space program.
how are you going to make it support hot reload? reading dart errors and finding sources in python is a problem too. why not to do it in usual dart? (which is quite good btw)
You say this is not beatable because of alphabeta, but a human could potentially score higher than it in games vs other players. It's unable to take risks that might result in beating naive opposition i.e. it doesn't know how to play suboptimally to exploit a weak opponent.
I guess? I created it just for fun, so you're welcome.
YEET
Uhhh okay

Start with the docs for each of those packages. They usually have them on their website or GitHub and even have getting started tutorials and examples.
[pyinstaller](https://www.pyinstaller.org/) or [nuitka](https://nuitka.net/doc/user-manual.html)
Have you looked at [Enaml Native](https://www.codelv.com/projects/enaml-native/)?
That's what I figured, was just curious if there was a better way I didn't know of. I think placing it in the startup folder might work as-well, going to try that later.
It oddly reminds me of binary tbh. 1 10 11 100 101 110 111

All I do with Lego is build huge sculptures, like Lady Liberty. Or some random dragon with an engine to make it fly, which obviously won’t work.
Thanks, not bad. I like enaml. I tried to build something similar after I saw how Kivy uses kivi lang. Could be useful to be integrated in my project. There is no markup for Flutter yet.
Yeah, a minute ago I thought: "To be able to build the transpiler I have to learn Dart anyways" Hot reload should not be a problem and to find errors I could use a kind of line-mapping-file.
good luck then
Much Future!
Cool! With a combination of the knowledge I gained from your clock, in addition to my own computer clock, I can tell that I am making this post at 5:34 PM.
A statisical approach using Leivenshtein Distance should be enough: &gt;The Levenshtein distance is a metric to measure how apart are two sequences of words. In other words, it measures the minimum number of edits that you need to do to change a one-word sequence into the other. These edits can be insertions, deletions or substitutions. [https://medium.com/@categitau/fuzzy-string-matching-in-python-68f240d910fe](https://medium.com/@categitau/fuzzy-string-matching-in-python-68f240d910fe)
Thanks
Just add a loop around the guessing game that only stops if the player has succeeded. something like: for difficulty in (10, 50, 100, 150): while True: [guessing game] if correct: break
That was one of the approaches I was thing of. The OCR text outputs a return character for each new line. I was going to split upon the return character and do a distance measurement vs each "sentence".
Real question is: Why not?
Yeah of course haha. The algorithm and the like for this kind of problem is like using a super specialized tool for a rather simple task. The real goal of this project was to make the computer interact with an user just to practice my OpenCV skills. But you're absolutely right!
There are tutorials, cutting edge presentations, and everything in between from the PyCon and PyData conferences, nicely tagged and searchable here: [https://pyvideo.org/](https://pyvideo.org/)
What do you want to achieve in the following part of your code? ``` players_return[(players_return.id == x.id) &amp; (players_return.date_g &lt; x.date_g)] ``` Maybe it is something specific to panda, i dont know that.... but are you computing the index by applying a bitwise and operation to two boolean values or have you mistaken the bitwise and for a logical and operator?
In before someone suggest going to /r/python If you prefer learning through books, checkout "Automate the boring stuff" and gi as fast as slow as you need. https://automatetheboringstuff.com/ If you prefer learning through videos, just speed up the video. Skip the things you already know. Need more info on what you meant by "cannot do anything at all with them"? It can mean anything from you think you know how to code but you actually don't... to I can code but don't know what to do with those languages?
Thanks. It means I know the basic syntax but I'm not sure what I can use this for
I will try this thank you

I also thought of the Mayan numbering system. It misses the zero with the eye wich would look nice.
You can also subscribe to [https://pymotw.com/3/](https://pymotw.com/3/) and of course read previous posts.
Do you want to be loved and hated by people? Here is a thought. Refactor the code so that the end result looks more nice, more eye friendly. Do not tell anyone what you are doing. Do not post on git or reddit the new result or the code. Add some extra smaller random visual elements but which are with no real meaning, just to confuse people. Take a message or a secret code or a poem or a blockchain private key and hide it in the end results between the dots and lines. Make it so that only small parts of the message are visible at different time intervals. Make it so that it takes a large amount of time (100 or 1000 or 10000 years...) for the entire "message" to be discovered by real people. Make a creapy site, add a short creapy question or message to it so that people are intrigued and post the result from your code to the site. Make sure the hosting people cannot see your code. Get back here in x years and check.how thinks has evolved.
Didja even try googling this? Or reading the sidebar? Or posting in a more appropriate sub like /r/learnpython?
1: /r/learnpython 2: read the sidebar 3: google "python [library] example/tutorial" Come on, man.
Actually yeah ı goole it but probably because of my country ı couldnt find any source that answers my question an as you in my profile ı am new in reddit so ı couldnt look the oldest posts sorry for that
I don't have any code at the moment, but I do have a recommendation. Try and demake a game into a text-based game. That's what me and my friends are planning to do with a game called [redacted]. Try it with a game you like!
I think your best resource will be [SciPy Lectures](https://scipy-lectures.org/). It'll be a good resource for Python itself but more importantly, will be a good resource for ways to use Python an you may expect as an engineer. I often suggest this resource to those coming from Matlab since it is geared towards that audience but does *not* make Python a Matlab clone\[ish\] (which you *can* do given how flexible it is, but absolutely **shouldn't!**)
What's your age and interests and available time? I could probably give you a suggestion based on that?
I am in my 30's and am available outside of normal business hours. My interests (as it relates to python) is using large amounts of data to investigate and solve problems. I really like the idea of using APIs to gather data, although this is outside of my current abilities.
Actually, the four spaces thing is the standard, according to the [original reference implementation](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#precode). The backquotes form is a newer extension popularised mainly by Github's markdown variant.
Building out a site now that will offer real projects up. Plan is to start an incubator August 1: www.growthtesttube.com
Why not write something that helps collect your own data relating to your interests/health/wellbeing and has a way to show the relationships between that data? A practical project that could improve your life if the data can be made sense of?
What if you made a console program with different excercises routines(reps/weight, running routines, types of workouts) that you could use to map out your gym time? Ie. Prints to a file an arms routine combined with cardio etc. That should give you some good practice utilizing dictionaries and creating different rules for which exercises can be combined in a single day?
Hmm, new Braille system!
The way I see it, programming languages are like tools. Suppose I brought you into my machine shop, it has all the tools anyone could think of, for example, drills, hammers, nails, a lathe, etc. Then I tell you, build anything you want, feel free to use anything in this machine shop. What would you build? The same goes for programming languages. You can tell your computer to do almost anything, what would you use it for? Here are somethings that Python is commonly used for. Analysing and visualizing data, building web applications, scrapping the web, programming electronic devices, simulating math models and control systems, image processing and computer vision. There are a lot of things you can do with Python. I'm biased, but in terms of market development, web development or data analysis would be you best bet.
I'm making a large collection of such games here: https://github.com/asweigart/pythonstdiogames They are: * Under 250 lines of code, so they're short enough to understand. * Fit in 1 file, so they're easy to copy/paste. * Only use the Python standard library, so there's nothing extra you have to install and they work on all OSes. * Are text-based, so the output you see on the screen can easily be traced to the print() calls that produce it, making it easier to see what parts do what. I'd copy the code by hand, play the game a few times, make changes to the code to see how they affect the program, and then try to recreate the game from scratch. Don't worry if you don't get the code exactly right: as long as the program is interesting and fun then you've made an accomplishment. I'm interested in feedback on this approach to practicing how to code, especially how it compares to doing practice problems.
There's another very similar framework I recently came across - https://anpylar.com (/u/anpylar) Would be lovely if these projects could gain more traction.
Bro make a watch for blind people with it.
Just remember that on most OSes, tasks started automatically behind the scenes may have less info prepared than your task might have assumed. Your task may start with the current working directory in a system folder or root, not your user home. Your task might not have a place to print standard output. Your task may not have many environment variables populated.
But why?
I’m into alternative propulsion and space travel in general. I hope you don’t mind my questions. What kind of drive is it? Is it an ion one, or a true EM drive? If the latter, how efficient is it, and what’s the biggest problem stopping it from being mainstream?
That's a really cool idea - marking the date of your projects with your own custom system.
Why are APIs beyond you now? Go and pip install requests, find some free API and go for it!
That example made me say bleugh! The function returns both a number (which is now even) or a string (which represents an error).
I fully agree actually. I would never write a function that returns an int or a string/None. But, I also wanted this to be an approachable piece and I didn’t want to introduce concepts which might be new/intimidating to beginners (I know exceptions were for me when I first started). Maybe that was a mistake after all.
It's valid pandas usage.
Although the lambda depends on a local variable... this is where you either use a class, turning the lambda into a method, or you turn it into a function (which takes players_return) and returns a second function (the lambda), OR you define it with parameters `def f(players_return, x)` and use functools.partial() when you call it
How about just `return number` of it's already even?
I guess it’s the least horrible option if we don’t want to raise an exception, yeah. I’ll revisit this example tomorrow morning. Appreciate the feedback.

That is some trippy shit dude.
Hello! I'm a bot! It looks to me like your post might be better suited for r/learnpython, a sub geared towards questions and learning more about python. That said, I am a bot and it is hard to tell. Please follow the subs rules and guidelines when you do post there, it'll help you get better answers faster. Show /r/learnpython the code you have tried and describe where you are stuck. **[Be sure to format your code for reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/faq#wiki_how_do_i_format_code.3F)** and include which version of python and what OS you are using. You can also ask this question in the [Python discord](https://discord.gg/3Abzge7), a large, friendly community focused around the Python programming language, open to those who wish to learn the language or improve their skills, as well as those looking to help others. *** [^(README)](https://github.com/CrakeNotSnowman/redditPythonHelper) ^(|) [^(FAQ)](https://github.com/CrakeNotSnowman/redditPythonHelper/blob/master/FAQ.md) ^(|) ^(this bot is written and managed by /u/IAmKindOfCreative) ^(This bot is currently under development and experiencing changes to improve its usefulness)

🤔 if I’m going to do something like that I’d start from scratch. I like the sound of this though. I’ll keep it on the back burner.
It's definitely not an EM drive, I would love to tell you I have a working one, but a lot of people are trying to figure that out already. No, this is a much more conventional Pulsed Plasma Thruster, solid fed with a block of Teflon. So it's not an ion thruster, those usually refer to Hall effect Thrusters, but it's an electrical engine nonetheless.

Yes! More Java developers switching over, trying to write Java in Python. /facepalm
Your python 3 example code isn't valid python. That doesn't give me a lot of faith in the rest of the project. Also, having to go from the website to the github page to the RTD page to get any details is kind of a pain.
Thanks

Python 3 example code from where the RTD or the README? Yes, I'm going to add a link to the RTD page on the website.
That could just as easily indicate that Python is more difficult and requires more searches for people to be effective in it. I don’t believe that, but does this make Python better than Java somehow? Honestly if you’re going to make a career in software development you better learn to be language agnostic if you want any sort of job security and mobility. Learn to use the best tool for the job at hand, and keep a bunch of them in your toolbox.
&gt; does this make Python better than Java somehow? Nopes. It just means that the Python community is growing. Which is a good thing if you like Python.
The gif in the readme should use `np.array([1,2,3])`. There's also a couple of places in the docs where you refer to the `numpy.array` type, but the type is actually `numpy.ndarray`: `array` is just a function which can create an `ndarray`. I also think it's a little confusing that you refer to "numpy arrays", "list arrays" and "tuple arrays".
The way you not raise an exception is to use a decorator.
What do you need an algorithm for? Just read the file start to end, dumping bytes out to a file whenever you reach a threshold. So long as the files are named in a way which is easy to sort, you can just concatenate them at the other end. See the unix [split command](https://www.ostechnix.com/split-combine-files-command-line-linux/) for an example interface.
Bloody Mary or mimosa?
 get!("io/print"); get!("io/stdin"); get!("types/to_int"); That's an great way of having 500 line imports! I say things like `true`, `while` should not be keywords but things that you import. Maybe we can make a turing complete language that has nothing but imports.
&gt;you I attempted to use Cython in neutron for python, but some features in Cython where not implemented (most python magic methods) which neutron originally utilized. I gave up trying to use Cython, but I may take a crack at it again. Right now, neutron is written completely in python, no c (except for maybe Numpy). One day (when I have some time), I should make the Numpy stuff run in CPython and the other stuff to be run on PyPy . Tomorrow I fix inconsistencies in docs regarding `ndarray` . Do you think I should change the syntax of the collection literals back to those of python?
Think of something that causes you problems, and try solving it. I did that, and took way too ambitious project that I never finished (but I am now retrying) but oh boy how much stuff have I learned.
lol I should make the imports better^(tm). Right now it feels too sluggish, so I should do make it more elagant.
what are your specific issues ? I'm running it in a pretty corporate environment and its working well. The buggest hurdle would be access to the plugin repo so you don't have to pull down packages yourself and manually install. The non-admin installer works well for us.
I think you can make a reasonable argument (from the trend, not the cross-over point) that learning Python is a better long-term investment than learning Java, but that's been true for years.
What was the problem?
I too found your sub interesting and would both like to subscribe to your newsletter and can help mod. Double whammy!
Me too! I work in propulsion at NASA and didn't know about this...
I love the clock.
Thank you
&gt; I am an artist and wanted a way to write the date on my work without distracting letters and numbers, so I came up with this system going to confuse the absolute hell out of some archeologist in the post-post-apocalyptic (once they rebuild and start rediscovering history) future someday. /s
A lot of it got eaten away by Android.
Well, as I said, Markdown is a mess. The original implementation can hardly be called a standard.

This is probably meanigful to many, maybe even most but there isn't a Python job within 100 miles of me so I'll continue focusing on C#, VB, Java, and PHP because those are the choices I have if I want to work as a developer in my area.
Nice. Python is a beautiful programming language.
Reminds me of Tokyo Flash watches
Python and Java are by far and large my favorite languages. Having said that, I wouldn't write a utility command in Java and I wouldn't write a complex system in Python. The title gives me the impression of a competition mindset. It's not. Each type of problem requires its own tools to be solved. In terms of search volume, it's obvious that more people will be searching for Python, between data science, (some) web apps, scripting, game development, etc. Of course not as many people are searching for Java while they're building enterprise-scale apps, distributed systems and large, complex code-bases. A simple comparison of volume/quantity has absolutely no bearing on whether one is "better" than the other. They're completely different tools with different approaches to solve different problems and they're both great at what they do - especially now that Java is on the fast track again with the OpenJDK 6-month release schedule! Python is probably the more versatile one, on top of the lightweight, concise syntax. It's only natural for it to be more widely used - but those "advantages", like any design choice, mean the language is lacking in other areas - some where Java excels.
Depending on what you do for work, "Automate the boring stuff" (available on sidebar) might be a good read. The book is VERY accessible and it feels good to get real gains from your code when you're still learning

Whats your skill level or what has been your learning path so far? What system do you use for programming? If you are looking to collect and track data, django is a great way to go, especially if you know a little web developement.
Well, either python is becoming the dominant programming language or you've shown the admittedly more interesting conclusion that snakes have become more popular than coffee.
According to these revisions, snakes &gt; Indonesia? https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&amp;q=python%20programming,java%20programming
My skill level is pretty limited. I have worked through codacademy and a few other free tutorials. Next month I am taking an in-person python course through general assembly. I am currently using anaconda for programming. I’ll check out Django. Thanks!
I hate strongly typed languages because it takes me about five times as long to declare everything as it does to track down type mismatch errors.
I wish I could implement python into my day job but python has pretty been shut down at work, unless I can prove it’d benefit the company (which I am not skilled enough to do yet).
Java now has `var` declaration for local variables similar to Javascript (non-dynamic) http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/286
I have no trouble picking up short-term remote python contracts. https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/search/?f_TPR=r2592000&amp;keywords=python&amp;location=Remote&amp;locationId=OTHERS.remote

Dangit, and I just started to learn Java after doing python only for 2 years
Have you seen PEP 484's static type annotations?
I don't know if mpg321 will do what you want, but there are ways to remote control audio playback,like this dbus spec: [https://specifications.freedesktop.org/mpris-spec/latest/](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/mpris-spec/latest/)
Hi there, this post has been removed as it is not directly related to the Python programming language. It might be more topical on /r/programming, /r/coding, or /r/technology. Cheers, /r/Python mods
Then again, for remote contract jobs in the past 15 days: Keyword | LinkedIn | Indeed ------- | ---------------: | -----------------: Python | 15 | 9 Java | 10 | 10 Javascript | 21 | 14
Yeah, I know they exist. Do they make things faster? Because I would declare things inside my inner loops if that would help, after everything is running and I know where I want to optimize.
Cause kotlin eating away at Java.
The floor is Java
Well, you could make a higher/lower game for a change /s
I appreciate your enthusiasm for sarcasm, but indicating it defeats its purpose.

No they don't, but you just mentioned repeating yourself and mypy has nice type inference ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
Nobody mentioned it though. And no, it’s not the same thing. They’re not trying to solve the same problem.
got it extended
I might need to dabble in something like this, could be very beneficial for a friend of mine
Check out the post. You can add snippets and time execution prompt to your notebook.
This image doesn’t mean you shouldn’t still learn java.
Code pls Btw cool
How many used cars do you need?
If it automates a routine task you may have it could definitely benefit them while also giving you an opportunity to learn. I’ve built scripts that make routine excel dashboards in a few minutes that used to take hours to do. That’s a real value add.

How accurate can those plots be? I mean python as a word is not only a programming language, java too means something else. Javascript on the other hand is only a programming language. That said the javascript community rarely uses javascript for searching. Its always a library name (jauery) , a comile to js name (typescript) or nodejs when on the server.
And schools are using python to teach people programming or to help non-programmers (stats majors etc) do stuff.
I assumed you used beautifulsoup? Just wanted to make something like this for work and could use a few pointers
Yeah he prob did
most typed languages have some form of implicit or inferred typing also types are much quicker to type than doc blocks. if you're not documenting your code, you should feel bad
when you select "python" or "java" you can select what you mean, i.e. coffee, island, or language

Wait, how do you identify good deals?
It's not just stats. It's completely dominating the sciences as the teaching language (well, some stodgy physicists still use fortran, but their students don't).
I understand how the seconds work. What about the minutes and hours?

I'm assuming it's 9:59 at the start of the video?
I 100% agree with this comment. I feel like this is how many people start. Then, we realize that we can make more difference with smaller apps aimed at a specific audience or a specific problem, and divide all the stuff we learned from that one big project to different projects.
Ok, so heres the comparison with nodejs included. https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&amp;q=python%20programming,java%20programming,javascript%20programming,nodejs&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app You could add typescript, react etc to the mix and add them all up as javascript.
Could someone explain what those approximately annual dips are? Christmas holidays?
The second link can still be improved....use topic "programming language" instead of "search term" to avoid excluding other related terms: https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?hl=en-GB&amp;tz=-180&amp;date=today+5-y&amp;q=%2Fm%2F05z1_,%2Fm%2F07sbkfb,%2Fm%2F02p97&amp;sni=6
