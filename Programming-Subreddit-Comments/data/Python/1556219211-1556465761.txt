Yes. There's `tkinter.Entry` for single line input, `tkinter.Text` for multiline, and `tkinter.scrolledtext.ScrolledText` for multiline plus a scrollbar. Try /r/learnpython next time.
An amazing journey of an amazing language.

Thank youuu
Anytime mate!
Yes, but it introduces some other issues. It would be best for Python to just abandon the distinction between mutable and immutable data types in general. Instead all objects should be immutable by default and explicitly made mutable by some keyword, like: def foo(mut x: list): x.append(1) It would fit more the "Explicit is better than implicit" rule from the Zen of Python.
While you're learning I would recommend using Jupyter notebook. Google that and how to install it, and it will let you program Python and get feedback from your code directly in a local web page.
Can i have your WhatsApp sir?
Why any problem?
Management: "There is a business need for X" Engineer (You): My research shows that X is best implemented in Python Management Resp 1: Cool, I heard good things about it, go ahead Management Resp 2: I don't care how you implement it. Management Resp 3: What is python? Management Resp 4: No, I have trouble hiring Python developers, please implement it in SQL. Hopefully, your job looks like 1.
I felt like all the rails people moved over to node, at least in my area.
I feel sorry for them
At first glance was 100% sure this would be a 4chan browser judging by the colours.
Are you talking about internal mutability or mutable bindings? Because avoiding internal mutability without a Rust-style ownership/borrowing system is not really feasible.
What is a 4chan browser?
My bad I meant 4chan client.
That's a terrible color scheme for people (like me) who are blue-green colorblind.
What does 4chan client mean? seriously I don't know

An application to browse 4chan. Kinda like reddit for mobile but for 4chan.
Oh I've never heard about 4chan before
I will try to give an example, what I'm thinking about: x = [1,2,3] # you can't mutate this list by x mut y = x # but you can by y x.append(1) # this gives an exception y.append(1) # this works fine assert x == y == [1,2,3,4]
It’s probably a good thing to be honest. Visit /r/4chan for its finest but I’d suggest not visiting that soul corrupting website (at least not at work / around spouse / children / parents / friends / pets / church)
And how is that going to help with your original issue?
Crazy, Python 2.6 was EOL in 2013 AFAIR. A lot of dependencies refuse even to work with it.
You aren't. And try /r/howtohack, example: https://www.reddit.com/r/HowToHack/comments/3fw71n/python_for_hacking/
let's not pretend we're not capable of thinking critically here
cheers man, this is a great list a fellow matlab survivor here
Awesome! A very useful tool
I am 16..... now is that appropriate to visit that now?
Thanks man!!
You do you dude but I'd advise sticking to reddit :) I'm 30 and I stick to reddit.
Hey, thanks for that ! It worked really well !
Sure then I'll stick to reddit for now 😁
Of course this should run on Linux. It is python !!!
Not sure, what I read about type annotations is that they are ignored by the interpreter, so I am not following the reasoning that we should replace the unit test. and as a side note : I have never seen test coverage of 20 to 30 procent for typed languages (usually around 70%). this was mainly for Java.
To Elixir here.
Dead language or at least no obvious additions to its relevance.
How did you get all the data of the chemical compounds, did you manually put it in or import it somehow? Nice job by the way
Don't worry, all the node people ended up migrating to Go.
All stupid questions regarding JavaScript have been asked already :)
For many types of project, this is not something you should aspire to. Whilst there may be some types of issues that can be mitigated by type annotations rather than tests (such as type confusing between cooperating components), this only works if all the code is type checked before it runs. For a monolithic project this may be true, but if your project is a library, or will otherwise interact with code that isn't type checked, or isn't typed, then that code can pass any types it wants around with impunity. So you still need to test what happens when someone passes a `str` into your method that only accepts `int`, because unlike in a compiled language, you can't prevent that happening.
Thanks, my case is the second and i didn't really find a good alternative to the main lib. :(
There is no such thing as a endoffile() command in vanilla python. The `not` operator simply inverts the operand. So `not True` is `False`, and `not False` is `True`. Try /r/learnpython next time.
What's with everybody using typing now like it's mandatory?
That's absolutely how I look at it. My big thing right now is trying to incorporate classes and when it's proper to use them. At this point, I'm trying to review other code and libraries hoping to gleem some commonality between them about when they choose to use make something a class.
I was about to comment literally exactly that :’( poor ruby indeed
The function is evaluated at definition. So are their arguments. It's not a quirk. it's not a bug. It's not an "unintuitive quirk". It's how function definition works.
Well, I figured it's more like saying "what's your first kitchen job like". And sure, there will be some variation depending on the type of restaurant, but there are common tasks like prep work that need doing that don't require a lot of skill.
Sounds extremely interesting. Could you share some code? At least snippets? Pseudo code? Anything! :D

What's the difference between Ruby and Rails? I've only ever heard "Ruby on Rails," personally.
 You might have a better time making the GUI in PowerShell as well, somebody made a generator for this: [https://poshgui.com/](https://poshgui.com/)
Because SQL is a domain-specific programming language.
Also, did you try Curio as well?
Sounds good i'll post my code in that sub.
Aha! thank you!
That’s because the people who built it (Atwood and Spolsky) were big names in the MS ecosystem already. They basically brought those established communities on the new platform. Also, they very much targeted SO as a competitor to the legendarily annoying “expertSexChange” and other VB-oriented forums that had been stuck on crappy late-90s vBulletin instances for ages - a demographic that was crying out for change.
That... doesn't sound all that good for Go, to be honest :P
Hell yeah!
Great! Glad to hear it!
SQL was always big; it was just overlooked for a period when we thought ORMs could do everything we’d use a database for. We were wrong.
I've tried to embrace a few of the typing mechanisms available, and I'm not sure how ashamed I should be of ultimately not liking any of them. I'm still grumpy at the semi-standardization that's going on after the initial proposal seemed more committed to keeping Python agnostic regarding annotation interpretation.
Rails is the node/django of ruby
Python has platform depended libraries, so just because something is written in python doesn't necessary mean a seamless cross-platform compatibility.
Ruby is the language, Rails is a web framework built in Ruby. Rails dominates the Ruby landscape so much in the West that I've often heard that Ruby devs have to specifically state if they are a "Rails dev" or a "Ruby dev".
Sorry I can’t help you then. I’m using DirectXDesktopDuplication method on windows with 1920x800 resolution. I can reach about 30fps with very careful implementation.

I agree with you. They are, to me, completely unreadable. They make a mess of the code and provide nothing of practical value.
Just making some simple games to get experience.
I wish I could refuse to work with it
A Q&amp;A site where for the most part the starter / learning languages / languages used by non-programmers have the most questions, who would have thought...
I found typing quite helpful to write more self-documenting code. It's also required to use in dataclasses, so if you have to use it in some places, you can as well try to use it everywhere in your project. And it can give you a hint that maybe you should rethink your code, when you can't write your parameter type in less than 80 chars.
Try using numpy multiply functions.
I see no value in dataclasses to be honest. If I have to use that functionality, I use traits or traitlets.
I will refer once again to the Zen of Python and bring the rule "Although practicality beats purity". The main question in my post was have you every used it the way it is? Well, have you? Because I have never seen a single example that was not a bug. But there is plenty of code everywhere written to get around it.
&gt; have you every used it the way it is? Yes. memoization, caching and lightweight objects. Especially useful to inject an external cache for performance gain.
Making a tool for my job right now actually, it'll be very useful if I can piece it together! Thanks man
No. Just write unit tests. Unit tests are not a hack replacement for static typing, they're a superior, nay necessary tool for establishing that the behaviour of your non-trivial code is correct. Your aggregate of 20-30% in other languages aren't "getting away with it". They're just writing more code for which unit tests would be low or no value. Python code is typically more expressive and so a higher proportion of your code is solving problems rather than getting boilerplate correct. Tests aren't a crutch, they're the lifeblood of maintainable code.
I would love to see some code, since I really can't imagine any case this would be better solution than making a class or a decorator. I just don't see any advantage (maybe some hidden small performance gain that I'm not aware of), but I do see big decrease in code readability.
I'm four weeks into a weekend project, and hitting a point where I need to redo a large chunk of it. I'm building a pipeline that will turn documents into ereader friendly formats, with a focus on starting with latex source. Right now I'm just trying to get a solid amount of latex rendered into html using python to call htlatex, but I'm having a painful time getting it to render most documents. I want to be done with this so bad but I want this tool more than I want to be done with it, so onward I code.

The Russian strategy by and large isn't to promote one political ideology over the other. The only reason they wanted Trump to win is because he's incompetent (which lets Russia expand their influence unopposed for 4-8 years) and because he is controversial (which divides the American people and makes the government less functional by reducing the possibility of compromise). If the DNC had put forth their own controversial and incompetent candidate, there's a good chance the Russians would have pushed for that person. The Russians played both sides in the election; the were found to be running both pro-Trump and pro-Hillary groups, designed to express controversial and extreme views from the right and left, to try and nudge people to the fringes. They ran pages that were outright racist trash, but the *also* were responsible for running and promoting some of the BLM, Antifa, etc pages and websites, specifically because they're controversial.

a non-turing-complete programming language
Well there is some weirdness here. Python is built in by default to many machines unlike other programming languages. Python has a low barrier of entry for scripting (like php, but easier and not just for web). And python is the most taught language in college these days, and who stack overflows more than people new to a language. I’m not dissing it, I use it a lot for localized scripting, but there is more than, “it’s the best language” out there.
Tbf, I started working with C# about 3 years ago and it has easily become my favorite language and .Net, my favorite web framework. But when I was in college we only programmed with Java and C++, so the syntax sits better for me.
Java's persistance is irritating
What's the weight? Questions being asked(like newb questions) vs. jobs/market share?
Honest question: do you think many people working on many things which may oppose each other is more efficient and effective than many people working towards a few, or one thing? I keep seeing this counter argument - vegans have their own opinion. Then it’s about military spending. Then green energy. Then it doesn’t matter because of what the last president did.
Thanks for posting the code! Do you have any objections to me forking it and playing with it myself?
Serious question from a Linux dev: &amp;#x200B; Why does everyone hate Electron? Is it basically Node.js for windows?
All those questions answered and still nobody knows how to use javascript.
Is Javascript even useful/worthwhile to learn if I’m not interested in building a website? Sorry for the noob question in advance
I'm right here guys
Why is ruby missing? It's right under javascript over half the time in this time series.
I'm based in UK and I'd be fine charging the equivalent of $90/h for standard jobs (the local market charges a bit less on average, but certainly not $20), more if the timeframe is compressed. If you already have a 9-to-5 that pays the bills, then you have to ask yourself if the additional time spent on a job that you don't like is really worth the small "raised capital" it would produce - time is the only currency you can never earn.

I was rooting for python but then I realized that it was statistically likely that it would win. (Based on my very small sample size of 1)

For a python3 to take precedence you need to modify modify your PATH. Also read up on virtual environment while you are at it. PATH and virtual env is what you are looking for.
python -&gt; python3 This is against python's own recommendation. See [PEP 394](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0394/0). &gt; My present solution is creating symbol links in /usr/bin/ Yes that would create problems with any program that wants to use python2 and you instead run it in python3. If you really want python -&gt; python3 make an alias in .bashrc, so it won't harm anything else.
This sounds like Windows advice. CentOS is a type of Linux.
Do you care to explain how so this sounds like a windows advice? :)
Windows names both python2 and python3 executables "python.exe", so the order of the PATH determines which will run (unless you are using the Windows Launcher). In linux python is installed with the major AND minor version, eg "python3.8", and we use symlinks like OP was describing to decide what to run.
I love it, even with a pytho gui limitation (i mean, the mostly are very old or rudimentary in some way) you managed to make a pretty decent and cute GUI for your app, very nice. Also you inspired me to make something similar but with biology (my area). Good job. PD: Maybe the next step should be make a web app?
JS can be used to build a site, Electron desktop application (resource hog), or a mobile app using something like React Native. Node is also good for server-side stuff, but that's about it. If you're looking at developing native programs then you're probably looking at C# or Swift/Obj-C. Python is the king of data science right now, so if that's what you're interested in then there really isn't an alternative other than maybe R. Scientific applications you're looking at either Python, R, Matlab, or Stata. Java, Go, Scala, Node, and many other languages are good for server-side stuff as well. There is no "best" programming language, they are all tools suited to certain tasks, so choose the best one for your application.
we hate it because Electron apps each consume at least a half GB of memory.
My current solution is to use pyenv for managing versions of python and virtual environments.
Because loading an entire copy of Chrome for every single app is a bit intense. If you have a complicated web-app that you want to get a desktop app for, or just building a complicated desktop app in general, it's fine. But if you're building something like OP's tool that has one screen, it's overkill, but so many people just go "I'll build it in Electron cause it's cool"
I tried your code with Modin: https://github.com/modin-project/modin ``` import modin.pandas as pd a = pd.DataFrame(data=1, index=['2018-12-31', '2019-12-31'], columns=range(0, 10000)) a = a * 1e-6 ``` On my 4 core MacOS machine the multiply takes 50ms, where pandas took 2.6s.
Everytime python beat another language I unconsciously touched myself
Man, I love C
Exactly. PHP and JavaScript are languages that have long been populated by barely functional, not really engineers. Shockingly, people like that ask a lot of (often fucking stupid) questions.
So anybody who mentions Clinton, Obama *or* Trump in /r/gif *or* /r/politics is now a Russian bot? Boy, does this make me proud for the Motherland. I'm not even certain there are still people on Reddit not in service of our glorious President. Jokes aside, OP has made a classifier of people who are maybe interested in politics, crypto, etc *vs* people who are here to exchange GTA screenshots and turkey recipes. Even if bots were initially correctly detected by reddit (надейтесь, лошары), you can't just compare them with general population. For starters you need to sample the same subreddits, maybe the same age bracket as bots tend to impersonate, the same political affiliation, that sort of thing.

Most of these animated bar graphs are built in Java from what I’ve seen/heard. I’d love to be proven wrong on this though — I’ve been working on one with matplotlib and seaborn in Python. It’d be great if somebody had suggestions for other packages.
Interesting variety of quotation characters they've got in their code blocks.
Oh I don’t think this graph is suggesting it’s the best language. Just that people have had the most questions about it haha. You’re totally right about the low barrier to entry skewing things here. I think “big data”, “machine learning”, and “AI” have emerged as successors to “blockchain” as the buzziest buzzword in tech. All three are in Python’s wheelhouse.
Using Python requires fewer questions.
Don't do this, or every distribution provided application that expects /usr/bin/python to be 2.7 will explode horribly. Just call `python3` as needed.
Where did it say it was the best language?
Is `a *= x` faster? You're creating a whole new dataframe afaict
javascript had a fun journey too
I didn't consider this before. Thank you!
What song is it?
You think the Russian bots use PRAW? LOL.
Man, I love Fortran
A lot has changed since 2015. 2015 is when most open source packages finally had python 3 versions. It's when many companies started to transition. Shoot, my company still has't other than for one project. EOL has a way of giving people a kick in the pants. I'm dropping support for my project in a week or two or whenever I get around to finishing the release.
True. Gentoo does this by default, and every time I run a python2 executable with `./` I get an error. It gets worse if a codebase depends on python2.
I'd still like to see what their message is for myself.
C'mon, Python! You can beat JS! You can do it!
In your face, Ruby! ^(j/k I like Ruby too)

https://pypi.org/project/marshmallow/ not very fast, but more powerful than jsonschema
I guess, OP needed nursery pattern, so that other tasks are cancelled, `gather` does not allow this.
I feel of these libraries are created by people who don't understand Python philosophy much. Many packages have syntax that is exactly opposite of what you would expect. Who would have thought that iter(df) gives you column names instead of rows?
The creator of Calibre needs more than a swift kick though. 2017: &gt;I am perfectly capable of maintaining python 2 myself. &gt;Far less work than migrating the entire calibre codebase. &gt; status wontfix And he's being encouraged as late as last month by an Arch package maintainer: &gt;As I've mentioned in the comment immediately above yours, &gt;there are valid reasons to suspect that just because the PSF &gt;drops python2, does not mean python2 will not continue to be &gt;supported elsewhere. Python2 is already long since frozen &gt;except for security fixes and the odd bugfix, so as long as &gt;someone continues to work on security issues, it's not really &gt;technically correct to state that it cannot be used, like, at all. The person quoted above also insists repeatedly that Python 3.x is "a completely new programming language" and not just a new version. The madness continues.
There are valid use cases for this construct, and yes I have purposely written code using this quirk for memoization. For example: ``` def fibonacci(x, *, _cache={}): if x in _cache: return _cache[x] if x &lt;= 1: return 1 y = fibonacci(x - 1) + fibonacci(x - 2) _cache[x] = y return y ``` Without storing the results, the function would encounter speed bottlenecks quickly as input values increase. Since this is meant to be used internally, protect it by making it keyword only by placing it after `*` and prepend with an underscore to signal to other programmers to not mess around with `_cache`. I will concede that this is not a common situation, but ask and you shall receive.
Check u/hvrc23 profile for Web app dude. I made this project based on his web app
Petition for more A11y compatible options on reddit, might help.
Could explain why you love C# so much?
I know but couldn't you simulate that doing what I mentioned? You catch the exception which is thrown by the initial task, then cancel the remaining items.
An only half-joking suggestion: try [nix](https://nixos.org/nix/) 😃
It's an excellent library. I'll try that. Thank you!
And that's what costs us a new smartphone every year, looking for a bigger RAM to accommodate apps written by some lazy millennials who don't believe in resource optimization and time/memory trade-off, and who think that only way to develop a portable app is a web app. Just because you can address larger memories in 64 bit archs, it doesn't mean you must use a gig of memory to check today's forecast. For those who started programming in the age of Turbo C++, egavga.bgi, Windows GDI, MS MFC and TCL/Tk etc. can actually appreciate these simple and elegant APIs.
Yeah, its trying to brand itself as "asyncio for toddlers" and "asyncio for expert python programmers" at the same
Yeah and R is where the real data scientists are, so you’d never see them equating stackoverflow questions with popularity.
Jokingly in the office we talked about a way to check if there was coffee without having to go into the kitchen. We use Slack a lot so I thought why not make a Slack bot to track it and have some fun with it. This includes a leaderboard so you can clearly see who the best person in the office is by checking who has made and reported the most coffee statuses! Hope somebody finds enjoyment in this :) This is a Flask API with a few endpoints that work as the commands for the webhooks from the Slack Slash Command API. It's setup for 2 pots but it's really easy to add more! This was a fun project to make tonight and think the guys in the office will love it in the morning :)
&gt; I used to say "human-music" English as a second language speaker here - "human-music" as in "music for common people", "folk music", or as "human music" vs "machine made music" (acoustic vs electronic?). I'm having bit of a problem with grasping the layers of "for humans" phrase thrown around in Python world.

Use virtual environments, that’s the way you should do it, if you want to run Python 3 projects on CentOS.
I don't want the most filled up space. I want the information to be easy to understand.
I feel sorry for them.
Use plotly, its great for animations too
Not very interesting, a bit of home automation. `stream()` loops over an infinite stream puts objects continuously in a queue/channel. `command()` sends commands in an infinite loop and alters its behavior slightly if there's something in the queue/channel that matches some condition. I wanted `command()` to gracefully break its infinite loop when `stream()` raises an exception and vice-versa, and when both have gracefully exited, restart both. Very easy to catch exceptions and gracefully cancel coroutines in trio, but I just couldn't get my head around it in asyncio. I could get `stream()` to gracefully terminate `command()` but not the other way around. I tried "signaling" between coroutines with a queue, which again only managed to gracefully terminate `command()` when `stream()` excepted but not the other way around, with the additional overhead of managing a half-closed queue. This was baffling to me because it was easier to communicate between threads in python2 than coroutines in python3. Then I switched to trio and all the exceptions propagated the way I expected, when one coroutine excepted I could gracefully terminate the other, there's no half-closed "signalling" queue/channel to tell one coroutine when the other excepted, and everything just works the way I expect it. How can it possibly be more straightforward to handle exceptions and signals between threads than between coroutines? I must have been doing *something* wrong, but I really don't care to find out because trio does it right.

This has to be threaded or async because `stream()`'s stream breaks upon disconnection and can't be correctly resumed without restarting `command()`. Similarly, `command()`'s behavior is incorrect without input from `stream()`. I wanted `command()` to gracefully break its infinite loop when `stream()` raises an exception and vice-versa, and when both have gracefully exited, restart both.

OK, hold on. Are you actually the developer of the _original_ Crypto For Science? If so, why do you want to port it to Python? If not, why do you want to clone something that's already there?
I paid for the development. I also helped a bit with the code. I know JavaScript, but I'm better with Python. I want to port because I believe more people would help its open source code in the Python community, I don't want to code in JavaScript anymore, and I feel like the Meteor framework that was used in order to build it is slightly dying. I'm also very good with testing and CI/CD in Python, but I'm Null in that with JS.
I did write one line in curio before deciding I'd better try trio first because it's simpler and go back to curio if it doesn't do what I want. I was amazed that my code worked exactly the way I expected minutes after gutting the asyncio blocks, so I didn't get the chance to go back to curio because everything works now.
You don't have to convert the ui file at all. You can use PyQt(4/5).uic to load them directly. Then you just subclass the object you get and all your widgets are attributes of the class.
I transitioned from python to R entirely a few months ago. Anything python can do in terms of statistical modeling or machine learning, R can do twice as well with half the code. Of course, Python still has the advantage of being a general purpose programming language. However, its use in data science and the scientific community more broadly, is certainly in decline.
That was the plan but the exceptions hitting the try/except just didn't propagate the way I expected. I'd bother getting to the bottom of it but everything works the way I expect in trio.
I’m reminded of the first webcam https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trojan_Room_coffee_pot
That's typical Kenneth Reitz. The guy produces excellent software, but is really full of himself.
God I fucking hate JavaScript. I enjoy coding in Python or C or Powershell, but JavaScript turns coding into a tedious chore.
Nice. If you want to expand on your work, have a look at RDKit. You can use it to convert smiles to molecular graphs and let it draw the structure instead of scrapping a webpage. You could also use it to match substructures. I am using it heavily for my research. Feel free to ask questions.
nice !
Thanks! I didn't know about DesktopDuplication, it looks promising! Would you share your implementation or some other code snippet?
&gt;trio Reith has made lots of cool libs, but Trio is not his library and he did not pull any code to that. You was misguided because of quote of his as the first line of Trio's README Trio was made by Nathaniel J. Smith , if I am not missing something;
He is a prick, and he used his bipolar as an excuse. It's a few years back, IIRC and at least one thread have been deleted since then. Kenneth wrote an open letter to the python community, where he basically asked people to love him because everything unloveable about his charaqcter was caused by brain chemistry. As a clinical depressed developer, I can only say bollocks to that.
There's probably a reason for that. Everyone wants to teach people to code with websites for some reason, even though web technology is so fucking fractured. I created a simple website with forms from a template, and to get it to work took SIX languages/technology: HTML, CSS, SKEL, Sass, JavaScript, PHP. And yes, I understand it's important for beginners to get an early sense of accomplishment from their early work, but I can do that with a logic/math problems instead of a graphic and keep everything contained to a single language. So, when a majority of beginners are trying to learn computer science with JavaScript, it's a super frustrating language to learn and you are going to get dumb questions. Seriously frustrating, it would take me HOURS to write simple JavaScript code because I didn't know how to get it working. I attempted to learn computer science with JavaScript and failed because I really fucking hate JavaScript. I find it super strict with formatting and absolutely horrid to work with and it absolutely does NOT spark joy. When I took a computer science class in C, I picked it up instantly. I then learned Powershell for automation, did some really cool shit with it, and I've been focusing on Python since I got laid off. I love Python, and want to get into some others, but I'll avoid web technology like the plague.
Elegant solution: class Cache: def __init__(self, func): self.func = func self.cache = {} def __call__(self, n): if n not in self.cache: self.cache[n] = self.func[n] return self.cache[n] @Cache def fibo(n): ... Best solution: from functools import lru_cache @lru_cache def fibo(n): ... You are mixing two things in one function, caching and computing. This is not a good code example.
Turbo C? Why would you do that lol
I'm new to both R and Python (and any programming) and find this very interesting. I thought it was the opposite, that more and more data scientists move to Python? This since Python is broader and what I've been told is better at data heavy tasks that require multi-threading etc. My friends (that mostly do Python) might be wrong and biased. However, our statistician at work has also thought about moving over to Python from R, but maybe he shouldn't? What's your opinion?
Damn I thought it was generated by some algorithm. I was really amazed at how would you do that. But it's just web scraping 😆 Still nice job
Sounds great, thanks for answering.
Thanks for the elaboration. And it does sound interesting! I must to try trio. Still, if you would like to share some code, it'd be fantastic.
Yes, you can always work around it. Hell, you can create a class with a dunder call method and do whatever you want. The point is that if there's any reason for which you want a function to have state, and you want to be able to override this state, and you don't want to go through the cost of creating a new class, that's when you need that pattern. The problem is that, in general, having a function that keeps state is a rare occurrence. But there are legit cases, and again, the language must bind those objects at definition, not at execution, because it simply can't bind them at execution.
The solution in the standard library violates a fundamental point: it was a initial and fundamental assumption that annotations were that: annotations. They carried no logical meaning. As far as I am concerned, it would be like having the logic on your code depend on docstrings content.
Just right click the directory in project view, mark as, excluded.
It's always good to be multi-lingual. I work in Python a lot and we're converting a lot of our terminal based applications to Web Applications so non-programmers can use them, this means needing to know JavaScript. Obviously its main purpose is web development, so if you're 100% sure you'll never touch webdev, then no. But if you think maybe some day you'd want to go the web app route then yes. Websites these days can be turned into dekstop applications (ie Spotify, VSCode, Atom)
It's popularity is rising because of machine learning and data science gaining popularity. A lot of non-programming professions are now side stepping into python instead of using spreadsheets. I know a few business analysts who use python to do their analysis'. And machine learning is everywhere from search engines to even hackers running classifiers over breached servers to figure out whats valuable.
My school is still living in 2017
funcion + state = class. This is exactly what class is for. Sorry, but until I see some real life example, I have to assume this is just about people producing bad code.
I was seriously hoping this would be a guide explaining how to use basic cryptographic libraries for researchers. Someone should make that too.
Dude can you share your idea for that biology project? Even I can give it a shot.
Can you share more details about the smiles to graph part? That interests me
Oh I didn't know about that since I use it in depth. But making your own GUI gives you more control over things I suppose

OK, thanks!
All because of Android I am assuming
yes, function + state = class, but... sometimes, some languages, provide facilities to speed up the creation of classes. This is the point: there are shortcuts. This is a shortcut. lambdas are shortcuts. list comprehensions are shortcuts. with statements are shortcuts. If you look at pep for the with statement, you can implement the same behavior with ordinary code.
Better yet, mark it as "Resource Root". Pycharm seems to still try to search the "Excluded" directories when you search in the command palette.
Don't take me wrong, I love Python, but I am also somehow sorry to see PHP on the way down :( According to Stack Overflow: "From 2016 to 2017, the year over year growth of Python in the US and UK market has been a steady 27%, much higher than the rate at which PHP has been growing." Now, let's just say, that I've coded in PHP for years, and the language is very dear to me. I've used it to create webpages, web services, standalone scripts on Windows and Linux and it's just a great language, no one can convince me otherwise. So, when over the past couple of years, someone came up with to me with a Python argument, I gave it a look, but I just couldn't persuade myself to consider learning a new language. Especially not the one that forces on me to indent my code in order to not to break the functionality. Hell no, that cannot be more superior than PHP. But then I have it a shot and as I am learning Python, I am constantly catching myself thinking, "Man I should have been doing this long time ago". What a great design, how nicely readable and simple and how easy is to add a new library, and how versatile... Anyways, what I am trying to say is, if you're new to Python, don't resist, embrace!

that should be easy
knowing python is like having a super power
Because simple apps using 500mb of ram with extra helper processes
Enterprise uses Java a lot
I learned Java and C# before Python. I really had a mind-block on Python simply because it didn’t have brackets or semicolons. I’m over it now, but I really got hung up on that for a while without fully understanding why. I love Python now.
I see it differently. What a journey other languages had towards the bottom. PHP died with its inconsistent design and its PYANAMAMK error messages. C# became irrelevant as java became irrelevant as the shift moved to web programming and data analysis. Everything else (C/C++) requires years of training to fully handle without blowing your face off. Perl was shit to begin with and so only those desperate and old enough used it (slashdot and bioinformaticians)
I was using BASH on windows. But `npm` seems to break when not using cmd.exe -- maybe they use non-cross-terminal output. They do a lot of re-writing cells.
I implemented the A\* algorithm and Dijkstra's algorithm. A\* uses Manhattan heuristic. Blue/white tiles are tiles in closed list and the color represent the distance for Dijkstra and distance+heuristic with blue being highest and white being lowest. Teal tiles represent open. Green is the starting point and red is the goal. This was done using Python and pyglet.
I just Wanted to poke fun at the jQuery guys :p
Sure! A good place to start is the [Getting Started Chapter of the officiel documentation](https://www.rdkit.org/docs/GettingStartedInPython.html). In principle, you can transform a smiles string (or different chemistry formats, like .mol files) with rdkit: ``` from rdkit import Chem mol = Chem.MolFromSmiles("COC(C)(C)C") ``` This procudes a graph in mol with all chemistry information. Important here is to understand [what a graph is](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics\)). Drawing the molecule can be done with rdkit too, although the quality is not on par with ChemDraw. But it's great to quickly visualize molecules: ``` from rdkit.Chem import Draw, AllChem AllChem.Compute2DCoords(m) Draw.MolToFile(mol, 'tbme.png') ``` It's also possible to get a PIL image to use it somewhere else: ``` img = Draw.MolToImage(m, size=(300, 300), kekulize=True, wedgeBonds=True) ```
Having paths be strings is actually ... kind of a problem sometimes. A path on POSIX systems is just a bag of bytes that are not guaranteed to have any valid encoding.

If you're looking to build a desktop app, you can build your interface in Python using something like PyQt, and then customize it using a declarative language called CSS.
No problem - happy to share!
Until last year, I was supporting Python 2.4, which I finally got to port to Python 2.7 ( all I did was remove hacks and fix a couple bugs). I also ported a Python 2.3 program. So yeah, Python 2.7 isn’t disappearing. However, it will be increasingly hard to find dependencies. I’m sure they’re out there but even as of today the binaries for wxpython 2.8 are hard to find. In 10 years other things will also have decayed. That Python 2.3 program had no exe and used numarray, so I didn’t even have a build to compare it to. Also, it’s only half a million lines...what’s that a month to port? Maybe as little as a week? It takes projects like wxpython longer because they maintain backwards compatibility and they decided to cleanup their build process.

What’s a declarative language? (I guess the language that stylish it, am I right? I tough CSS was mainly for web content)
I do primary geospatial analysis, maximum likelihood modeling, and network analysis. I was previously using Arch GIS for geospatial analysis, Stata for statistical modeling, and doing network analysis in python. It's been substantially more efficient to just do everything in R. I use an Nvidia GPU for parallel processing in R.
I think you are looking for GUI packages, right? You have tkinter for example.
A declarative language is one where you can't describe a sequence of actions, or control flow, or anything like that - you can only declare things like "this button should be red", and it's up to the language (or in this case, Qt) to figure out how to actually get it done. Also, CSS was originally designed for web content, yes, but many toolkits have adopted it as a way to customize their desktop apps as well.
Thanks! I will look more into it :)
Thanks! That was helpful :)
I have used kivy for some time to build a few apps and simple games. The problem with kivy is that it is pretty hard to compile all the dependencies to Android and the APK sizes turn out big sometimes if you have a lot of dependencies. If you really want to try maybe this will help you (I guess you use Tensorflow) https://stackoverflow.com/a/42891407/8098331 But especially in your case I would go to write your app in Java, because translating it is probably much faster than trying to compile the project and eventually fail with it. From what I heard about BeeWare is that it is still in early stages and even simple apps are broken there.
Cool stuff! Though I think more people might check it out if you linked to a Github repo or similar, rather than a zip file.
It might be a detail, but you would need to wait until all the tasks are finished cancelling. Just calling cancel() won't wait for the cancel to be finished.

I was partly on the windup with my original comment - Python adherents seem particularly zealous. A very basic summary is that most of the latest non-ML stats comes to R first - due to academic statisticians mainly using it. On the other hand most ML comes to Python first, and it’s probably more mature as a full stack language. But, in truth, R is rarely far behind with ML - if at all - and is catching up rapidly in terms of ease of use in production. It was never that hard given it’s been in use for years already in production scenarios. Lots of newish packages making various things (like multithreading) very easy. Similarly, Python is rarely far behind in non-ML stats. So basically pick what you like. Julia is also coming up fast. It makes things like multithreading really easy, albeit it’s not such a mature ecosystem - at the moment. But it’s got most of the main stats/ML stuff, with a lot being added all the time. Plus recent addition of debugger etc. In theory I think Julia should supplant them both - but it’ll be a while and might not happen if they’re just too embedded already.
R is fine except for manipulating those pesky dataframes. I do data import and all dataframe manipulation in python with pandas,numpy and save them as csvs and then import into R. But I mostly do statistical stuff and regressions where R is way more polished than python.

If you are doing scientific computing, NumPy is essential. So many other libraries depend on it as a backend that it might as well be considered part of the standard library. In fact the `...` constant has no real functionality within vanilla Python; it was introduced just for NumPy!
Thanks!!!!
I still use Stata for most data management tasks. Doing data management in R makes me want to put a bullet in my head.

Take a look at [PySimpleGUI](http://www.PySimpleGUI.org) as it fits well with getting information to run a script of some kind, and then outputting the results of the run. Are you making a call from the Python library in order to execute your shell script? One easy way to go about things is to create an "Output Element" in your window. This routes stdout to your window. Then you an update your user in the window by simply printing. Here's a little sample program I wrote for you to see how it works. You can run it online using repl.it: [https://repl.it/@PySimpleGUI/Reddit-Example-stdout-to-a-window](https://repl.it/@PySimpleGUI/Reddit-Example-stdout-to-a-window)

`pathlib.Path` is not subclass of string. Brett Cannon has clarified [the reasoning behind that](https://snarky.ca/why-pathlib-path-doesn-t-inherit-from-str/). Which totally makes sense, but omits the fact that some of the developers (me included) would rather prefer "practicality over purity". The library is targeted to these group. The other reason is that I wanted a simple api (like infamous `requests`) with `pathmap`-like functionality of [rake](https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.0.0/libdoc/rake/rdoc/String.html#method-i-pathmap).
Why not use select to wait on all ports atr the same time, and handle it all in one process?
Cool! Looks helpful, and a nice way to abstract over config formats. A couple of things which I think might be nice additions: `config_type_priority` takes a list of strings. You as a developer know what values those strings can be; I as a user do not, and will probably have to delve into your API docs every time I want to find out. Even if I remember the names, is it `"envvars"`, or the more pythonic `"env_vars"`, or what? You could vastly improve the discoverability of your interface by optionally using `Enum`s (possibly the `StrEnum` from `enum34-custom`, for interoperability), where I can say "Oh, I need a `ConfigSource` here" then press tab and immediately have all the options in a way which plays nice with type checkers. This `str`-as-enum pattern is a pervasive headache in python, which made sense before we had actual `Enum`s, but we've moved past those times now. A more minor thing I suppose is that PyYAML is a big dependency with compiled components which may not be compatible with the same interpreters that the other parsers are (is it compatible with PyPy?). It might be nice to hide each parser's dependency behind an `extras_require` key so that downstream users can flag exactly what they do or don't support (and thus avoid particular dependencies if they want). You could have a `full` key which grabs all of them, of course. A cool feature might be adding an option for recursive search to the `ParseIt` class, where the directory and file a config item is in adds to the key sequence (a tuple). For example: ``` config/ ├── global.json └── inner1/ ├── inner2/ │ └── that.toml └── this.yaml ``` and `parser = ParseIt("./config")` would allow me to find values like ```python parser = ParseIt("./config", recursive=True) parser["global", "my_global_key"] parser["inner1", "this", "internal_key", "key_i_want"] parser["inner2", "that", "things"] ```
I didn't know A*. It looks cool, but I guess it can be fooled with a malicious map. It would be interesting to see some maps where Dijkstra is faster.

Hi, Thanks for your input, all 3 issues are valid points I think are worth considering but I don't think this is the place for this so if you could open a ticket about them &amp; we will talk it over using proper methodology?
I think I'll attempt to build my own midi library. I don't need much anyway, just creating a file and adding some notes. I'll have to research how to do that, otherwise if it's too difficult I'll try again with this one
Use some markup for your code next time. Please specify ‘infinite input being taken’, do you mean that the while loop continues forever? Because then you’d be entirely right. As long as you give input that is greater than 0, your loop keeps going. You’d have to rephrase or build in a condition on which the loop breaks. What are you trying to achieve actually?
 Sir, I want to know why is it forming infinite loop. My input command is outside the while loop. So how is it depending on the while loop condition .
Great illustration on the methods. A* appears a lot quicker, did you run into any maps (size, layouts, etc) where Dijkstra's algorithm won? Did you ever test any maps with no solution (completely blocked path)? Is this open sourced somewhere?
You can also just give it more RAM if this is the case. I let pycharm use like 4GB of RAM because I can.
? what a waste of time.
&gt; pathlib.Path is not subclass of string. Correctly so. Writing an entire library to undo this feature seems like a step backwards and an absurd conceptual compromise to save on explicit casting by typing *str()* for the diminishingly few libraries that still accept only byte/string inputs for paths. &gt; practicality over purity The most practical thing to do is to always weigh the cost vs. benefit of injecting an additional dependency into your code, esp. when it replicates functionality already built into the standard library. EVEN IF making paths a subclass of strings was somehow better (it is not), that is still an extremely small benefit (i.e. saving someone from typing 3 additional characters to explicitly cast a Path to a string in the few places where that still remains an issue today) in exchange for adding an entirely new third-party library that needs to be maintained. You can expect that built-in Pathlib will be well-written, well-tested, and well-maintained for some reasonable period of time. In contrast, the author of paz might be a terrible programmer, or get hit by a bus tomorrow (that is not a threat). So in my mind PRACTICALITY is : - A) Can I write my own array/matrix library or use python's built-in structures to replicate it? No, of course that's insane, the most practical cost vs. benefit thing to do is to use numpy. - B) I don't like sometimes having to type str(path), even though that is the conceptually correct thing to do. Should I replace built-in Pathlib with an entirely new third-party library? No, that's insane cost vs. benefit wise... that's how you eventually get to crap like [left-pad](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/03/23/npm_left_pad_chaos/)

Thank you for the helpful comment.
If this is the case for OP the memory bar in the bottom right corner will be mostly full. I don't know how to increase it though, but I've never had a project as large as OP (only large file trees of non code files).
OP needs their solution to be deployable on Windows, and Pyserial only supports fileno() for the Serial object on Posix platforms. Where I've had to mix serial and network communication, I use select() on the sockets with a timeout then check in_waiting on all the serial ports.
Oh thanks

A\* works by using a heuristic to tell it what the minimum distance between any two points is, and assumes that the current edge with the minimal (distance\_sofar + minimal\_distance\_togo) is the most promising. If the heuristic never overestimates distance (as the 'straigt line' or 'manhattan' never do) it will always find the best path. &amp;#x200B; A map that would 'fool' A\* is a map where you are lead towards the target but in the end encounter a dead end, so it needs a seemingly suboptimal move at the beginning to find it. A breadth first (like Dijkstra?) will explore that branch earlier than a 'best first' like A\*.

That code is very hard to read and it probably belongs to r/learnpython . &gt; however, once the user cancels writing when they go to read they are put into a loop this happens because once you answer `y` after the first data input, the value of `cancel` is "y" and `if cancel=="y"` is not inside the `while cancel.lower()=="n"` as it should be. This answer your specific question but is not very helpful, the overall approach of this module is very messy and I suggest you do not go along this line. In the **being helpful** spirit I suggest: 1. read [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/), try to follow its syntax guidelinse 2. do not post screenshots of your code, you have the code, even the less in a slideshow; you have the code, use it as text 3. look for

Honestly, yes -- you're reinventing the wheel. If you're looking to manipulate tabular data in any form, there's `pandas` or `dask`, depending on the scale of data. As far as ETL scheduling/orchestration is concerned; you're looking at apache `airflow`, as you mentioned.
Since you're still new at Python, PySimpleGUI will be a good fit for you. It will take maybe a couple of hours to get what you need up and running. Take a look at the sample program that shows realtime output. All you have to do is plug in the values to get to your EXE and then run the command. Take a screenshot or two once you've got something working. It should take you an afternoon to make the kind of GUI you're describing.
a quick question....how do you install rdkit? Its not available through pip install also
Awesome
I am only aware of the possibility to install it with anaconda.
How long have you been learning Python for? How long did this project take to complete?
I made a couple of somewhat similar demos, for instance: - [A simulation of a bunch of particles doing Brownian motion](https://youtu.be/TFJikEX2XyY) - [Visualizes time evolution of various waveforms allowing for a choice of different dispersion relations](https://youtu.be/_fsjPMSnZqc) Both use PyQt5, the first embeds an animated Matplotlib figure, while the second is done with PyQtGraph &amp;mdash; which IMO performs somewhat better than Matplotlib for animated graphs.

Predict whether an MLB player makes the all star team or not using logistic regression. Possibly might use a neural network if it's not too difficult.

Yeah, but like you said - it just will be explored later than it could otherwise have been, but it will still be explored *eventually*, as Dijkstra is equivalent to an A\* with a heuristic `h(node) := 0`. You are just sacrificing an extremely-rare-worst-case performance for the sake of much better average-case performance.
What did you use to process/get data to plot from the Audio?
Interesting, Im starting in on the same task. We just picked Huey and will be playing around with it in Django.

I nodded a few times reading this :) Perhaps you could add mypy? It's an essential part of every project I work on nowadays. Even if you don't use type annotations, it is useful for identifying type errors. Places where None values aren't handled properly etc.
Take an actual python
And how is that done? Any idea?
Did you try looking for it on github?
Random geekout: these two are typically brought up in the context of motion planning, but they are applicable to finding paths on any graph that satisfies the algorithms' assumptions (e.g. non-negative weights). For example, you can express some action-space as a set of nodes with associated costs, throw A\* at it, and now you have a F.E.A.R.-esque easily extensible agent AI.

Just to help clarify what stebox is saying. On the one hand, jsonschema refers to a schema language, on the other hand it refers to a python lib to use this schema language. The python lib is completely based in python dicts, lists, strings, numbers and booleans. No serialization to jsonfiles is necessary. You can programmatically create your schemas in Python code and then valdiate your Python data structures. I personally use it all the time.
I spent most of today creating a tool to extract email/category information from our (terribly mismanaged) outlook shared drive, exporting the output into various excel tabs. This will allow the team to manage work flow, ensure we are responding to requests and that mailbox is being used properly.

You can totally get a job with language X (e.g. Python) even if you don't have previous experience with it. So what you should take with you beyond your resume is some understanding of your strengths. Instead of saying at each booth "I've no experience with Python..." you should lead with "I'm great at building reliable software" or "I'm great at scaling web applications" or whatever it is you're good with. &amp;#x200B; More here: [https://codewithoutrules.com/2018/01/23/job-with-technology-you-dont-know/](https://codewithoutrules.com/2018/01/23/job-with-technology-you-dont-know/) &amp;#x200B; I did a resume review open space last year, might do one again this year, so if you're interested look for it on the open space board.

There is probably a higher-level way of doing it which makes more sense if the boards are already networked, but (py)serial would be the standard answer for low-bandwidth data across short distances like this.
Why on earth are people posting those in a PROGRAMMING SUBREDDIT.
It got removed.
Ah, I see, their verbatim copying of the original article isn't copyright infringement because they put one line of text linking to it.
I would suggest a simple server/client setup. Would be able to transfer all the data.
Awesome!! &amp;#x200B; Was looking for something like this. Great job!!
Business card if you have, and also be ready to code: some presenter booth sometimes have some live coding/MCQ about python – which is technically not the job fair, but is still worth trying.
Im trying to figure out how to make and apply a neural network
Install anaconda and install it from [the rdkit channel:](https://www.rdkit.org/docs/Install.html)
Well technically I have "experience" with python because I use it almost everday in my free time. How would I be able to showcase my personal projects? I don't know if I will be able to get something on Heroku in time for the fair. Should I actually print out some code?
Sounds interesting. I don't know if I would be able to use the booth since I'm only signed up for the job fair, but I hope so.
&gt;So the x axis represents the wave length and the y axis represents the amplitude in its current setting. Id have to change it so that the x axis represents wave frequency then i suppose. Your code is pretty odd... Normally this kind of plot is done with an FFT. You're doing something with zero crossings instead? Can you explain it or add comments? zero_crossings = np.where(np.diff(np.sign(v_sample)))[0] data = [] for i in range(len(zero_crossings)-1): x1 = zero_crossings[i] x2 = zero_crossings[i+1] diff = abs(x1 - x2) frequency = diff / len(v_sample) amp = max(max(v_sample[x1:x2]), abs(min(v_sample[x1:x2]))) data.append((frequency, amp)) I think what you're doing would only make sense if you were analyzing a single sine wave, but not a mixed song like you have here.
Would love to read an article about this.
I'd like to give the traits stuff a real go, and have been reading the official docs and examples, but I'm not very comfortable with it yet. Can you offer any example projects making use of it, and/or your take on (big) traits vs traitlets? Or any forums/chats where I might get some interactive discussion/support?
its usually 20 Hz to 20 kHz, 0 couldn't be reached on a log scale
&gt; Can you offer any example projects making use of it None. People apparently don't like Enthought (no idea why) and therefore don't want to use anything they make. traitlets: well, jupyter. &gt; and/or your take on (big) traits vs traitlets? traitlets is very simple. Does not do very advanced notification, and has no UI capabilities. traits is a lot more versatile when it comes to notification. It can notify for list content changes, for example, or it can dispatch to different threads. None of this is possible in traitlets.
Thanks, appreciated!
Just talking about them is fine. Honestly most of the people in the booth are trying to convince \_you\_ to apply to their company, that's their main goal.
Pipe of resumes, dress professionally, notepad/notebook to take notes and contact info down for follow-up from conversations you have, some snacks if you want.
Im going to write it up on github soon
I don't know what FFT is but I'll look into it, I honestly have not ever explored anything with audio before so this was a first. Basically i just found each point at which it crosses 0, then measured the distance between them to get the wave lengths, and then used those wave lengths to find the frequency for each individual wave by dividing the wave lengths by the length of the samples which are in view. Feel free to correct me if I did anything wrong, im sure you're more experienced than I :)
Well, that would make me stand out from the crowd.
That’s a pretty big area for python, and since this is a python sub that seems like a bad idea.

Yes, that is wrong, because your music isn't monophonic. To see why, go to Desmos.com and graph 3 functions: sin(3x) sin(5x) sin(3x)+sin(5x) You'll see that the zero crossing rate for the third function (which is polyphonic) doesn't tell you the frequencies of the individual component sine waves. What you want is an FFT, which you can get with np.fft.fft()
How did you manage to get such high fps with that precision fft bins?
Combination of pyenv + poetry solved so much of my issues with python packaging, you should really give it a chance and test it !
You can use Google Collaboratory, cloud equivalent to Jupyter notebook.
look into [jupyterlab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), dependent on the exact use case it can be a bit limited. There is also a Web IDE integrated in [Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/2018/06/15/introducing-gitlab-s-integrated-development-environment/), also a bit limited. Finally, a fully fledged web IDE is [Eclipse Che](https://www.eclipse.org/che/)

I don't think with an accurate heuristic for A\*, which I did use, Dijkstra would be faster than A\*. I didn't test on the maps with no solution, but thats a great suggestion. I'll clean up my code and upload to github soon and I'll make a new post about it.

It's been a while I don't look at this...but from what I remember is possible to install anaconda without having admin access to the machine You can install on your local user only
Just use vscode in portable mode
You could look into iron python which is a .net implementation of python.
Check higher up - he (somehow) didn't use FFTs for this and instead detected frequency via zero-crossings.
Thanks! I just implemented it and it looks like it's made an improvement :)
Google Collaboratory 100%
It should. The Fourier transform literally replicates the exact same signal but per frequency, you can run the inverse operation to get the exact input back. It should help your program run faster (it's insanely optimized) and improve the accuracy that the visualizer appears to have. Side note, if you haven't already, the Fourier transform returns a complex number, so make sure that you take the real part of the numpy array or take the absolute value. It should be able to handle it without but you might get warnings trying to plot a complex number or something.
I have been looking as well for some time but have only come to two options: &amp;#x200B; 1) [https://codenvy.com/](https://codenvy.com/) 2) [https://repl.it/](https://repl.it/) Codenvy is great but really limited. I have not been able to use matplotlib for instance. You can do command line output but you won't get any package that does visualization to work. &amp;#x200B; I recommend repl. It has come a long way from what it was. I have been able to use all (mostly) packages without much issue and even done some flask prototyping with it.
I've put it on github now, the file with FFTs is the [fftfreq.py](https://github.com/ravenkls/Visualise/blob/master/fftfreq.py) (obviously) [https://github.com/ravenkls/Visualise](https://github.com/ravenkls/Visualise)

Prototype Project DLRP - 2019 Hardware: Raspberry Pi 3 OS: Ubuntu Mate 16.04, RetroPie V4.4 Languages: Python, Java Temporary: Berryboot OPERATING SYSTEMS Ubuntu Mate 16: Currently striping down the OS to the bare minimum I need. An alternative I've chosen over starting from scratch, (A server or mini.iso), then building up instead. Version 2 will be done using this method, but for the time being I need to learn more about the main components of Ubuntu, and the new kernel recently released in UM 19. I've been using my favorite command for cleaning; “sudo apt-get purge --auto-remove ProgramName*”. This method is fine on a small scale where I'm familiar with what I'm purging, but doesn't help me remove large packages and dormant software. Synaptic is also a good tool to use, but it's limitations are still my ignorance. A comprehensive guide on the steps to take to strip down a distribution to its “barebones” or my essentials would be greatly appreciated. RetroPie V4.4: More testing is required before community support is necessary. OpenELEC: Analyzing code and components to determine if integration, into an admittedly crowded system, is even necessary. (The thought or idea is that there would be a specially designed OS to handle the three general tasks of; Gaming, Audio/Video, &amp; Administration) HARDWARE ISSUES Power: Will consistently show lightning bolt symbol in top right-hand corner of the screen, indicating it doesn't have enough power and/or USBs are demanding more than the unit can constantly produce. Boot: Looking for solution to avoid having to keep third party bootloader installed, (Berryboot), in-order to have an OS run from a USB. GENERAL QUESTIONS Is there an easy method for overriding or forcing components to update? Either one-by-one or in bulk. I realize that some aren't updated because there could be compatibility issues with the newest version of the software, but I'm not a typical user so problems caused will be documented and repaired. Is there a comprehensive guide to programming a Python project start to finish? Maybe a template? I can only conceptualize it to a certain point before it becomes redundant. In other words I need to know where to draw my lines. For hosting a small website, (single domain), is there open-source python tools or examples to aid? Have no experience with website creation or hosting so would need to be a beginner's guide. Packaging the stipped down UB OS once Version 1 is completed - then it can easily be installed on other Raspberry Pi units, as well as extracting the necessary components to build a version that can run on an early 2000’s (former XP) computer - which will act like a headless server with only text output. **AUTHOR NOTE** The Ubuntu community is notorious for telling you not to do something and/or to do it their way. This is why my post exist in the first place - I have specific questions that need specific answers. That's not to say don't give your opinion, just please give an actual answer along with your justification. In return, I promise to research your answers before I ask for clarification - in other words please don't dumb it down for my sake. I look forward to chatting with all of you! :)
where is the "symlink a library into project folder" one?
If you're interested in playing around more with audio and digital signals checkout the scipy.signals library. Another pretty visualization (of a whole audio file) or any digital signal are spectrograms. Matplotlib has a function built in for graphing them called specgram. I wasn't able to get it at the quality of matlab/octave makes but they're pretty cool.
I think matplotlib's rendering speed would be the bottleneck waaaaay before the FFT size.
Probably going to have some fun with some mild web scraping -- post-finals joy.
You should look into using MQTT. Very easy to use and quite lightweight. Good for sensor networks.
That's what I'm looking for in my case. Users will be creating the fields which will be stored in the database. Then, when I get an input, I'm be creating a schema using the fields on the fly from the DB and validating the input against it.
You the executable was written in python, or you want to make tools to decompile it in python?

You're right about the zero, my bad, but you're wrong about the 20. It goes down to 10. The value is rarely shown since it is inaudible and sometimes it is ([like this one](https://browse.startpage.com/do/show_picture.pl?l=english_uk&amp;rais=1&amp;oiu=https%3A%2F%2Fi.pinimg.com%2Foriginals%2F6e%2Fa3%2F40%2F6ea34080ca808d0e66aeb468b78cacb5.png&amp;sp=fcd964c94e3162a8fa8e2d08ea2ad94a&amp;t=default)).
Instead of "The same code without Paz" in the docs it would be nice to see the same code in path.py and pathlib.
Oh i didn't know, i thought you was inspired in a similar app, the web app also looks nice. Well i dont have anything yet but maybe a some kind of pokedex but with animals or plants.

Probably it’s that the version of OpenSSL included in the repo is not new enough, you’ll need to update that first. The alternative is that you don’t have the -dev package installed for the library.

Even better: Redis.
I’ve done something very similar to this with Redis: https://github.com/rpj/rpi It works so well I wrote a minimal RPC implementation on top of it as well (it’s in that repo), and also use it with Arduino’s with this library I wrote: https://github.com/electric-sheep-co/arduino-redis Of course it’s equally easy to interact with from just about anything else too, so writing web UIs that consume the data or database sinks to persist it becomes trivial. Have fun with your project, sounds like a good one!
I have also found that python multiprocessing module supports remote access as well, [https://docs.python.org/2/library/multiprocessing.html#using-a-remote-manager](https://docs.python.org/2/library/multiprocessing.html#using-a-remote-manager)
Cool
FreeCAD is terribly underestimated piece of software. Its importance for open hardware might be enormous.
I did think of using some form of DB but was worried about the raspberry pi's lack of CPU horsepower, but I am probably being to worried, the 3b+ should be able to cope, and I really only need two becasue of two screens. I'll take a look at redis too.
Redis isn’t really “a DB” and therefore is incredibly lightweight. The central manager device for my whole home network is a super-old RPI 2b, it runs Redis just fine as do all my Zero Ws. In fact I literally run it on every Pi I have as the local IPC mechanism. Definitely take a closer look at it, I think you’ll be pleasantly surprised!

I can not answer all questions but this is what I know: auto update packages can be done with ubuntu package "unattended-upgrades" Python app: I presume backend for the web app, look at Django or flask. flask tutorial : https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world Hosting website on the ubuntu machine: nginx or apache tomcat (think it only supports java, not sure. been a while since I used it) enjoy the project
Great! Keep us posted.
To include in an existing python project, http://pythonnet.github.io can work well.
quick and dirty: X supports "external" displays, run on one computer, display on another one
yea, it's a bit slow though. I am doing that to develop my code, and it works fine to develop, but the display is slower over X than on the pi it self, plus I am not sure about touch over X
Thank you for your quick reply, and your helpful answers!!
I'm aware it's very long and borders (if not crosses into) rambling, but please bare with me as this is my first time reaching out to an online community for guidance. Future posts will be concise and to the point. Let me be clear up the confusion by stating my first specific goal, and we can work from there :) I need instructions on tearing down a Ubuntu to the bare minimum. In this case it's the journey not the destination as I want to learn this particular disto &amp; flavor inside and out. I know there are minimum and server versions I can build up from - but that only works of I'm fimilar with all necessary components. The Raspberry Pi is actually fully operational and is currently running updates in the other room. It uses Berryboot for two vital reasons; 1) I don't want it to run off an SD card. 2) I like having it choose between two or three distinct ISO that are specifically designed to do different tasks. Please let me know if you need further clarification.

The author has said they wanted to put an interface around the built-in path and file manipulation libraries, in a similar way to the requests library. I think you're doing it a disservice by going on this long rant about how the author "might" be a terrible programmer etc. To me, the briefest scan over the docs and the code show that it's not about paths being subclasses of string, which seems to be the issue you're fixated on. It's an abstraction, built on top of those well documented and tested ubiquitous libraries, not an entirely new library. I think your post is pretty unfair, unwarranted and just all around negative.
List 3 submissions to this sub that are about machine learning and *aren't* just quickly thrown together lists of libraries to import and I'll take back that blanket statement.
Congrats on your first program! Hopefully the first of many :)
Try looking at the [learning resources wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/index#wiki_new_to_programming.3F) in /r/learnpython. Best to ask questions there.

Are you sure you should be using pip and not pip3? Please do ` which pip pip3 python python3`
How about looking into using C# or F# or PowerShell? When all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.

Probably an issue with you requirements.txt file, but clearify that with /r/learnpython

You can use python in RStudio if you have R's reticulate package.
&gt; As a first step, what I was planning is that the bot should follow an admin account - which can just tweet or DM the bot account commands like “add keyword docker”. That’s why in “main.py” admin handler is defined as a listener. Ah that makes sense. &gt; I’ll implement these functionalities when I find time, maybe in the upcoming summer. What other features can I have? An obvious one might be to get the admin account to tweet some stats, for example how many "insta" responses it made, how many tweets, retweets, likes etc it made, how many urls from each news source did it use etc, in a certain time period (or since last time you asked)?
Lower (and upper) end of a spectrum are not hard defined and depend on the application (your graph for example goes up to 50 kHz) - they just can't be 0 in a log space. For the average audio application, 20 Hz - 20 kHz is probably a good default, although the lowest frequency is often also limited by FFT size (at 256 bins your resolution is 86 Hz). Also, if inaudibility would be the issue, I'd argue that anything above 18 kHz (and often much lower) isn't really relevant for anyone past high school
Massive working codebase that needs to be ported, checked and tested. This entire exercise adds no business value and prevents revenue generating features from being delivered

r/learnpython is the best place to ask questions about python.
Depending on why IT and the higher-ups doesn't want python installed, they may not be happy about this. Do they want you spending your time writing code? And how excited are they going to be about this: &gt; upload files if possible
It does. The joke should be about companies instead :)
It's not going to go away instantly, and plenty of people and companies will keep using Python 2 - and that's OK! The real benefit for the ecosystem is that every open source project who wants to go to Python-3-only can do so from January, and refuse any Python 2 requests that don't come with patches or funding. I know I'm looking forward to that for my projects!
&gt; My first REAL program!!! Man, that evoked feelings of my first programming successes. Congrats, keep it rolling!! Also, props for the well-organised repo.
Tremendous job!
AWS Cloud9 is pretty awesome. It’s basically a remote development environment running on top of an EC2 instance. Which means you have full access to the underlying machine (upload, download, ssh, etc). It also has an “auto hibernate” feature that shuts down the machine after a predetermined amount of time to save you money.
wish i knew about `path.py` before. it provides the similar functionality i needed. though it lacks `pathmap` (guess the authors might consider adding one). `paz` is the way i tend to pronounce `path`, since i'm not native english speaker. my language lacks `θ` and `ð` phonemes, so it's one of my weakest points (besides using an articles improperly sometimes).
I'll check it
Get on the winamp milkdrop levels, then we talking, kid.
Saved you a click: it's a linear estimator. We estimate the slope of a linear relationship between variables, and check it against all the values we know until we find the best relationship. Then, add a bunch of fancy new vocabulary to keep people from understanding.
Has SHA256 been cracked already? But I'm interested in the source code anyway.
Apologies for the poor video format as this is my first time uploading my code to reddit. I would have linked a GitHub repository but I'm really not that familiar with it and tend not to use it as I code mostly my own projects. Anyways, hashcracker.py allows for dictionary attacks on MD5, SHA-1, and SHA-256 Algorithms via custom wordlists. You copy and paste your path to the wordlist, and you're good to go! I'd like to work on adding the option for outputting to a file and reading hashes from a file. Also, eventually adding compatibility for salted hashes would be good too. If you guys want, I can quickly throw the code up on GitHub, but I figured I'd finally share one of my projects with Reddit.
Yeah, the algorithms I'm using are by no means secure for storing passwords, but that doesn't stop developers from using them.
Care to share your code? I want to see it in action.
How is it a crack then?
Sorry, a better word would have been resolve. The program doesn't actually do anything with the algorithms aside from just hash each line in a wordlist. It's a pretty simple program.
Absolutely, just setting up the repository now.
Sounds like it should be pretty simple once you get a generator that produces the successive primes.
Not really. Just recently [git moved from SHA-1 to SHA-256](https://public-inbox.org/git/20180725083024.16131-1-avarab@gmail.com/). This code is probably just brute-forcing with very poor efficiency if it doesn't use a dedicated compiled C module. If you really want to crack some hashed passwords use tools like [hashcat](https://hashcat.net/hashcat/). It proved to be quite efficient even on a typical home computer's GPU.
Im still learning the basics, and the free app Sololearn has been my go to place. They offer a bunch of different introduvtio courses and they have a small community, forums, challenges etc. You can interat a lot with others if you want to
Git still uses SHA-1. Since it's such a foundational part of how Git operates moving to another hash algorithm is going to take some time.
So you’re using a rainbow table?
Hey, im really new to python. Can you tell me what program you use? Thank you
Sorry, I was careless. Corrected my comment.
Anaconda does not require to be admin of the computer. (which not means that IT will be pleased about that, but they cannot prevent you from installing it)

More or less, except that I'm actually computing the hashes where a rainbow table is precomputed.
Instead of a blank `setup.py` file, you can add a `requirements.txt` which lists the python packages needed to run your project. Pip can spit out your currently installed packages into that file with `pip freeze &gt; requirements.txt` and then you can trim it down if you want. For instance, for this you might just want pygame ~= 1.9
OpenCV builds for Windows, OS X and Linux differ in some ways. For Mac the GUI part is probably build using os-specific libraries and that's what You see.
I guess it will give an exception instead of silently filling the default list. But this is a huge change. If you wanna a immutable list, why not using a tuple?
So you’re brute forcing the hash algorithm until you get a match? Or do you have a plain text file of common passwords that you convert to md5/sha256 hashes and compare?
He is running a dictionary attack. For every word in the supplied list, the hash is generated on the fly, and compared to the output. When a match is found, the plain text version of the hash is displayed. Nice little program.

Hey I'm actually trying out learn python so I can build a copy and paste bot for a subreddit I created. I need a bit that will copy any post made on that Reddit and then paste it as a comment on the post. Do you have any suggestions or hints for me? I'm a complete noob at python and programming in general so I don't even know where to start. Thanks in advanced
My program does the latter; You specify the location of your wordlist and for each string in that file, it is encrypted into whichever hashing algorithm is picked and compared to the unknown hashes the user enters.
You’re absolutely right about my code not being efficient. I understand there are programs out there like hashcat and John the ripper which run much faster and much more effectively than my program. When I decided to make it, I figured it would be a good way to understand some new concepts and be a fun program to code, which it was. It was something I wanted to try, so I did it.
So since people seem to like it, lemme explain. Fuzzle isn't your ordinary search engine that indexes the content first and uses some fancy-ass class to store your data. Fuzzle is very simple and that's where the beauty lies. If you need to change Fuzzle, go ahead! It's easy. Need a version of it for your website? Easy AF as I've made a JavaScript version and am already using it to showcase how (relatively quick) Fuzzle's algorithm is on my [website](https://dan6erbond.github.io). Fuzzle takes key-value pairs (dictionaries in Python) and requires at least the key "key" to be present in said object. It uses that as the main source of finding matches but also supports the key "tags" which needs to be a list of strings/characters and scans those with a lower priority. It saves values like coverage, accuracy and category in the return objects/dictionaries and if there was a singular match, it only returns that in a list. The JavaScript version has been customized to support custom fields as well. That means Fuzzle Js will prioritize "key" but then look for "tags" and whatever else you specify. I'm currently working on expanding that functionality to the Python version and creating some (simple) models that allow you to tell Fuzzle what field is most important/should be weighted the most.
No, it hasn't.
[https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/)
No, it hasn't.
Good way to learn!
It's not an example of "encryption".
Since there's really no way to go back from the hashing, I suppose it really isn't encryption. I'll change the word to something better suited.
 Aren't those breaks unnecessary? def promptPickMode(): userMode = "" while userMode not in modes: userMode = input('\nError, please enter the hashing algorithm you want to use (md5, sha1, sha256)') if userMode == "md5": print("MD5 algorithm selected, continuing") return userMode break elif userMode == "sha1": print("SHA-1 selected, continuing") return userMode break elif userMode == "sha256": print("SHA-256 selected, continuing") return userMode break
I’d real encourage you to use git for all code just to get familiar with it. Amazing to me with the popularity of github that most entry level engineers have no idea how to use source control because it’s not taught in college.
Practice is important. There are some aspects of the code that should be modified/refactored to be more concise and cleaner, though. I mean general programming stuff, not specific to this project. Would like a subjective list?
If you're offering absolutely. I'd love to get better any way I can.
Consider making an Asciicast with Asciinema instead of using video.

Nice program, but aren't there already a lot of other programs for this already, like hashcat?
Yeah there are, but I thought it would be fun to make my own in python.
Great job. I read the code, really nicely structured.
Yeah why develop your own stuff for the purpose of learning?
Agreed and if your reasoning is you don’t want to share (for whatever reason) then use gitlab or Bitbucket, both of which offer free private repos.
Gotcha. I’ll take baby steps with some of the online versions and try that over time. I’m pretty familiar with the coding/user aspect, but not the ‘safety’ of using it and how and what python has access to. Do you have a link by chance that easily explains the behind the scenes of anaconda, or python in general? Sorry if that’s a dumb question.
I checked it out! Turns out it’s going away in the near future :(
Not trying to bash you or something. I‘m a real noob in programming. How do you now, that your cracker worked? Would love to know it. Thank you
It’ll be cleaned. Sometimes excel just doesn’t cut it for some of the big files we use. I think it’s probably safer to just have it hosted on the computer but lacking the vocabulary to explain that. Do you have a link that might help me explain the security questions they might have?
Github offers private repos as of about 2-3 months ago.
Am noob, what is this program designed to help with? &amp;#x200B; ty :)
GitHub now offers free unlimited private repositories for people with free accounts. I believe the only restriction is that you can just have up to three collaborators per private repo.
Python anywhere
Would u mind saying this in plainer English please?
Those three things are cryptographic hash functions. Essentially a function where if you give it an input (anything input from numbers to text to binary) it will output a "random" hex string of a fixed length. It's random in that the same input will give the same output but slightly different input will give very different output. Given the output it's very difficult to get the input.... Cracking means finding the input given the output These hash functions are used in cryptography, passwords etc.
Lots of stuff, actually. For one I made [Fuzzle](https://github.com/Dan6erbond/Fuzzle), [RGB](https://github.com/Dan6erbond/RGB), [Egosaurus](https://github.com/Dan6erbond/Egosaurus) and [Seedless](https://github.com/Dan6erbond/Seedless) which are all OpenSource and available for you to download and customize to your liking. They're very simple scripts which is what makes them so easy to use and add to. I'd love to see people fork them or even contribute to them! My main project right now is actually **Banhammer** which is a Discord bot [Mariavi](https://dan6erbond.github.io/mariavi.html) has been working on for a while now and hopefully will be available soon. It comes from an idea the moderator team at /r/casualChildAbuse had as we used Discord a lot and getting notified when a new post was made was quite handy. The bot streams posts, comment and even modmail in addition to notifications about actions taken by the *Anti Evil Operations* to specified channels in your Discord server and uses reactions that allow you to delete, lock, approve, ban the user of a post etc. and is currently in its beta phase. Still on our to-do is working out what happens when the bot is removed from a server while he's scanning subreddits as well as what happens when he's unmodded or doesn't have the right permissions to perform an action. Sounds simple but just having a bunch of if-statements is gross ;-). I also recently worked out a bot for the [Substarters](https://discord.gg/njYdKYH) community which is a Discord based community for Redditors and moderators alike that are working on getting their new subreddit on its feet or trying to revamp an old one. We're open to having any new members and would love to see anyone join! The bot helps us in explaining common problems as well as sets you up for the server.

Take a look at the [gist I prepared](https://gist.github.com/wodny/45f9094c2ff3683d1aac5d5ce0a435eb). It contains comments.
&gt;Once the program is running, just click point with the mouse to create a live cell. &gt; &gt;Once you have a pattern, press space to run. When you want the pattern to stop running, press space again. &gt; &gt;To kill a cell, just point and click a highlighted (or live) cell to kill it. Add quoted into readme file, create third section there named "Usage". Good job!
Thanks for the recommendation. What do you like about python anywhere?
I had been working on writing a comprehensive blog post about `scipy.sparse` module and just finished it the other day. I was using `matplotlib` to create dynamic animations for the various formats by accepting any 2-D array and output relationships to the underlying sparse structure. - [article](https://matteding.github.io/2019/04/25/sparse-matrices/) - [code](https://github.com/MattEding/Python-Article-Resources/blob/master/sparse-matrix/sparse_matrix.ipynb)
Ah that sucks, it was a pretty cool idea. I used it a few times but my workflow is almost all console based so SSH and tmux works better for me.

&gt; Its importance for open hardware might be enormous. Very true! It already has promising integration with [KiCad](http://kicad-pcb.org/), an electronic design automation tool. It's also used for design by the [Open Source Ecology](https://www.opensourceecology.org/) project and I'd like to do a redesign of the [Precious Plastic](https://preciousplastic.com/) machines in FreeCAD.
I think it’s awesome that you put so much effort into making this and sharing it. Hopefully you’re learning some things from the input you’re getting.
&gt; I think it’s probably safer... You could well be right, but that's immaterial and not what I asked. Security often isn't about being secure, it's about following the rules. If the security department is unhappy, you will be unhappy, right or wrong.
People are plain stupid, and stupid knows no boundaries.

Ive always wondered. Are ALL MD5 hash and salt algorithm the same? Like if I go to facebook.. ohhh nvm they save their password as plain text🤦🏻‍♂️.. More seriously though, if I take a Hashing algorithm from ONE company, if I input "hello" as a password, would the Hash string be the same FOR EVERY Hash algorithm?!
[removed]
[removed]
Forgive me if this is a newbie question but does this use a database or this works for anything with MD5 encrypted
[removed]
I would love to be able to write security pentest programs like this, but I dont know where to begin, even if I'm familiar with Python . Any advice or resources you could point me too?
Love it. Aiohttp APIs in production and a couple of complicated low level software mostly talking to industrial hardware using different TCP protocol. Blazing fast, rock solid
It's not really a company thing but the algorithm. MD5 is universal and should give you the same result everywhere. SHA1 is the same everywhere. But MD5 and SHA1 will not be the same . And then salting is a different story. Two different companies will use different salt which will change the output for sure (that's the point).
that would depend on the salt they are using. If you just enter "hello" you will always get an md5 hash of 5d41402abc4b2a76b9719d911017c592 but if they salt it with say hello + dontstorepasswordsinmd5hash = f98b75786f5a05105df3ebe5e28ea189. The hash will always come out as the same if the input is exactly the same. That being said hopefully companies are not generating and storing passwords in md5. I would hope they are at least using something like Argon2 or bcrypt to manage that.
Not always... An example was something I built for hashing files. It used sha256, but never gave the same output as regular sha256. I assume it's because of the method of chunking I used... But, I kept it in, harder to recreate and crack without the app. However it will panic people that hash it manually and compare the hashes.
Sweet! I was wondering because I wanted to make a program that takes a password as an inout, converts it to hash strings, modifies the hash strings and returns the actual word of the modified hash string. Is that doable?
Sweet!! So for instance "hello" will have the same hash output for let's say Facebook and Instagram ?
So what is md5 used for? I mean I have very little knowledge of how computers work but from my understanding, they are encrypting a string of text.
The hash they store in their server you mean? Absolutely not.
They wont because of salting right ?
“The cloud” is just other people’s computers. That said, AWS Lambda is pretty nice for this sort of thing.
One use I know of is to check for authenticity. You get a md5 sum hash and a file. To check the download server hasn't been compromised you check the md5 sum of the file you downloaded and compare before executing it.
Thanks! I hope so too! ;)
Would LOVE to see how ya did it
&gt; props for the well-organised repo Thanks, I tried my best basing off of how others have done it.
So if the sum is different, something happen to the file ?
Yep
Thanks!!
&gt; Instead of a blank setup.py file, you can add a requirements.txt which lists the python packages needed to run your project. Tbh, I got ahead of my self when sharing the repo. I was just really excited that it worked at all. &gt; Most seasoned pythoneers then know that all they have to do to grab this project's requirements is run This is why I have a setup.py instead of a requirements.txt ...even when I first started out, this was so alien to me that it took awhile to understand. With the setup.py file, you can just do python setup.py and be on your way. Truth is, it's just easier for the end user in the long run. With the requirements file, it's easier for the dev in the long run.
&gt; really nicely structured Thanks! Making readable code has been a big point for me since I first started. I'd rather have my code be readable than be clever.
&gt; Add quoted into readme file Thanks! I'll take a look at it when I have some time.

Glad you did. This discussion was int*eresting.* *+1 to* [Scrabbilisk](https://www.reddit.com/user/Scrabbilisk) for mentioning [asciinema.org](https://asciinema.org) As an old coder, who's become a dirty manager, I echo the sentiments to get yourself a github account. Source control management is an art I've seen some of the best programmer, do very poorly. I set one up just to become familiar with the differences from Subversion (SVN), Perforce, CVS, and TFS which I'm more familiar with (oh yeah, and visual source safe; I did say I was old) so I could get familiar with what "the kids" are using these days.
Wait, that's illegal
input() function returns a string, which you then compare to an integer, this is basically what python is trying to tell you.
Wouldn't precomputed hashes be more efficient? Not as dynamic but the most tasking part of the program would be handled before running it so the runtime of the program would be shortened dramatically.
VScode with the pylint and pep8 extensions, and venv for virtual environment. In VScode, if you create a virtual environment in your project directory, you can easily select that as your python interpreter. Easy and simple setup that suits my needs well.
Welcome. Try posting to /r/learnpython
Wrong Sub! thanks for the correct sub :)
It's not complicated at all, really. import hashlib WORDLIST=input("Word list file: ") MD5 = set(input("MD5's comma separated").split(",")) with open(WORDLIST) as wl: for line in wl: md5 = hashlib.md5(line.encode('utf-8')).hexdigest() if md5 in MD5: print("Hey mate, I found ya secret! '%s' is md5 of %s!" % (md5, line)) That's not tested and just quickly tossed together, might be some string/bytestring/line ending bugs hiding around it, but should give a general idea.
Thanks for the recommendation! What do you like about AWS?

That's a rainbow table
It was taught in my college and we used it for all of our assignments. But college programming assignments don't really necessitate using git. Each assignment is in its own repo and you're the only one working on that repo. You don't need to resolve merge conflicts, or stash changes, or branch from master, or cherry pick changes. Git logging and diffing and reverting and stuff probably would have been useful to me back then, but I got by without it. Long story short, I've been using git for years and I'm finally starting to learn how it is supposed to be used since I started working. I put on my resume that I was familiar with Git. I guess Dunning-Krueger wins again.
[Mido](https://mido.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) looks pretty good, but be sure you have all the dependencies installed, including for whatever backend you're using. For just creating a midi file and adding notes there's also [MIDIUtil](https://midiutil.readthedocs.io/en/1.2.1/index.html).
Please edit your post and format those folders lists so we understand what is your goal here. Module is a python file. A directory having \_\_init\_\_.py file in it is a package.
Md5 hash the solution the program offered. If the resulting hash matches the input, your program worked
I doubt any of the big websites are using md5 for password hashing.
I tried to format folders, hope structure is visible now.
I recommend using [PRAW](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), this library makes the use of the Reddit API super easy. What you would do is to first create the PRAW instance, then get a submission instance and assign its text to a variable. Then you will call the reply() method on the submission instance with the contents of the previously assigned variable. It will take around 4 lines of code.
Modules are python files, directories with \_\_init\_\_.py file in them are packages. If you don't want \_\_init\_\_.py file in a directory that means that you want to instruct Python that no code is placed in it or its subdirectories.
To be fair, MD5 isn't much better than plaintext.
It would be very simple to to this using the standard Python sockets library.
/s?
Yeah sorry I communicate exclusively in meme references now, it can get confusing
Thats what im thinking haha
No. That is the point of a cryptographic hash: you cannot go the other way.
Isn't "crack" a terminology for something that was reverse engineered? As far as I know, all those algos are hash also, therefore can't be cracked but guessed by brute force attack

To clarify, MD5 and SHA are not suitable as password hashing algorithms. You should be using something like PBKDF2, bcrypt, or Argon2.
Super awesome

How could there be a problem with the requirements.txt file given it is creating the file, not reading from it? doing "pip freeze" gives the same warning.
It’s not random. Hashing algorithms compress bits of data into smaller bits.
No, pip and pip3 are the same,python adn python3 are the same, this is in a 3.5 virtualenv.
For you to be getting `Could not parse requirement: -ython` then somewhere `-python` is passed as an argument. I wish I could help more but I am as clueless as you are.
That code is for Python 3.
Is your code, especially the model, open source / hosted somewhere?
Use python2's string format: `print '{}'.format(len(s))` or `print '%d' % len(s)`
Even on single-person projects it can be really helpful. It's a log of your progress, lets you try new ideas without worrying about breaking things, a backup, a way to transfer work from computer to computer, helps you pinpoint bugs, and more.
There's aspects of randomness. If you take a file and hash it, then flip ONE bit in that file and hash it, there should be no relation from one hash to the next and it should appear seemingly random. Cryptographic hashing algorithms should produce a hash that is essentially equivalent to being random. If I gave you two arrays of bytes, one being a sha256 hash and one being 32 random bytes, you should not be able to determine which is which in any possible way. It should appear perfectly random.
He is just brute forcing by converting a list of common passwords and converting them into hashes and matching them. So if someone uses an unusual password, it won't be cracked regardless of the encryption scheme used.
yeah, thats what I am thinking, that it is a typo in some pip config file or source code. I did update pip the other day
I agree with the first part. But the goal of a hash is not to make things appear to be random.
Hey thanks for the advice. Most of what you said makes sense. Im still a little lost about going about and getting started but I think that's just cuz I need to understand python better. Do you mind if a message you along the way if I have any questions?
thx

Rainbow tables are entirely different than this. Rainbow tables rely on pre-computed chains of hashes https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_table

**Rainbow table** A rainbow table is a precomputed table for reversing cryptographic hash functions, usually for cracking password hashes. Tables are usually used in recovering a password (or credit card numbers, etc.) up to a certain length consisting of a limited set of characters. It is a practical example of a space–time tradeoff, using less computer processing time and more storage than a brute-force attack which calculates a hash on every attempt, but more processing time and less storage than a simple lookup table with one entry per hash. Use of a key derivation function that employs a salt makes this attack infeasible. *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Python/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28
You should not use md5 for that purpose, [because it’s possible to generate hash collisions.](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/1434/are-there-two-known-strings-which-have-the-same-md5-hash-value) An attacker can replace the executable with another file with the same md5 hash. One use I can think of for md5 is checking integrity of files after you copy them locally.
There's still a lot of that shit out there. Maybe not google, but I would not be surprised if a tech giant out there is doing something similarly insecure when it comes to passwords. There was that Adobe leak where their passwords were encrypted with the same key. No one had the key, but they also leaked the user question and secret like "What was your first car", and the encryption algorithm produced the same output for the password "hash" for the same password. Essentially breaking user passwords was a crossword puzzle. You could sort it by encrypted password so you have a bunch of users with the same password, then you could look at all their questions and answers and be able to guess what the password was if it was simple enough. I would not be surprised if a decent amount of popular companies still do similarly bad stuff, especially older companies. md5 hashed passwords was popular for a decent amount of time, and then salted md5 was considered a best practice for a while too. The knowledge that you need strong password hashing like bcrypt or PBKDF2 wasn't common until relatively recently... and companies sometimes don't spend the time to migrate old passwords and fix this stuff. It's not trivial all the time. You have to do something like wait for the user to log in again, validate it, then if it's good take that plaintext and re-hash it with the more secure algorithm. Or crack them all manually and re-hash if it's weak enough. It's not the easiest thing and if they use the former method, older accounts that never log in again are still md5.
Oh good to know. Lots of website still provide md5 hash with the file so that's what I knew. Thanks for the updated knowledge :))
I’m kinda impressed, relieved and sad at the same time. Encryption is cool
Ok, there is a mis-named package, $ pip list Package Version \-------------- ----------- \-ython 0.29.2 &amp;#x200B; but I can't uninstall it becasue of the - it thinks -y = yes, then looks for an option -t and there is none $ pip uninstall -ython &amp;#x200B; Usage: pip uninstall \[options\] &lt;package&gt; ... pip uninstall \[options\] -r &lt;requirements file&gt; ... &amp;#x200B; no such option: -t
Hey good job! I love seeing people learning through practical examples like this, but I have a few suggestions if you're wanting to improve this: you dont need the user to tell you what type the hash is. MD5 is 128 bits, SHA-1 is 160 bits, and SHA-256 is 256 bits. you can get the length of the hash they enter and know what it is without user input. command line arguments are more useful than an interactive program. having your program require no input from STDIN allows your work to be used by other scripts and really increases its general utility. Go learn about argparse and try to implement that. You will never be faster than hashcat or john, and that is fine since it seems you are doing this to learn. just keep in mind you won't be able to outperform them.
Could be a few reasons. They could use a different algorithm. One could use PBKDF2, the other bcrypt, both being common and secure password hashing. Even with PBKDF2 you can use different settings, a different number of rounds of a hashing algorithm (usually sha256 with PBKDF2), and the output would be different. If you go [here](https://www.dlitz.net/software/pycrypto/api/current/) and find the PBKDF2 function, you'll see the function signature looks like this: PBKDF2(password, salt, dkLen=16, count=1000, prf=None) If any of those arguments is different, it'll produce different output (well, like one in a trillion odds of producing the same output if it's the same length I guess).
So MD5 hashes are 16 bytes long. It's a cryptographic hash (not the strongest and not recommended for cryptographic purposes these days), and that means it has a few properties. It should be seemingly random output and indistinguishable from random data. Even if you flip just ONE bit in a gigabyte file, it should produce a COMPLETELY different hash from the one without the flipped bit. Changing the file at all should make it completely randomly different, with no relation to the other hash. It would be similar to encrypting wildly different files. This means that it can be used for a few purposes, one being checking the integrity of the file and making sure it is the exact same, as the same file will produce the same hash. There are other faster ways of checking file integrity. CRC32 is maybe more common when you want a very fast way of making sure there were no errors in transit, but it's not good for cryptographic purposes (neither is md5 anymore though, but that was its intention). You'll often see either MD5 or CRC32 used to check to make sure a file is the same.
No problem! Knowledge in the security field is ever changing, it’s difficult to keep up-to-date :)
Wow I guess my professor was wrong...
A capstone project for the python course I am taking is to build a blackjack game. Simple rules, involved process. I learned a lot and would recommend it.
It's a dictionary attack, not a algo cracker. Professor is prob still right.
Or rather use python3. Python2 will soon be [obsolete](https://pythonclock.org/).

It wouldn't actually be sha256 then, though, right?
Nothing I said is specific to the MD5 and applies to any hash. I used it as an example and you can fill in your favourite hash instead.
Relative imports only work within packages, so you'll need an `__init__.py` file in each directory containing code in order to use them. If you really want to run a module located inside a package as a script, and it uses relative imports, you can set the `__package__` attribute of the script and it will work. I wrote the [set-package-attribute](https://pypi.org/project/set-package-attribute/) program to do this automatically.
I did it in java for my senior comp sci project with a hard coded AI 😂 I found it two days ago and it was awful 😂😩 I was so proud of it back then
1) go to r/learnpython 2) just forbid any further movement when they are in touch
Honestly it’s mostly that I’m more comfortable with it having used it longer than other similar services. Given that you’re a beginner, I’d say just find something with a free tier you can play around with and learn on one platform. You can branch out later.
 don't import like you did either use this: `from InstagramAPI import *` (\* means everything here) or just `import InstagramAPI` I recommend using second one, cause it prevents libraries from overriding two functions with the same name
I think (may well be wrong here as I also struggle with import related issues like this) you need to insert the path to the directory where the module is into sys.path. Before the import statement you just need to import sys, and then run sys.path.insert(0, &lt;path to the directory containing the module&gt;).
Can you paste the code?
It looks like the package itself is not installed. Use `pip install .` to install it. Or just use `pip install InstagramApi`
Well it doesn’t matter cause it’s the same no matter what I type. Also it just started working again for some reason and I’m really confused
Thanks for your suggestion :) I corrected that and am still receiving the same error message, but I appreciate the help! I'll keep that in mind!
look for a script itself in Lib directory, to check, if it's installed
Thank you!! I tried `pip install InstagramAPI` as the library said to, but I received the message: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement InstragramAPI (from versions: ) No matching distribution found for InstragramAPI I also tried `py -m install InstagramAPI` as suggested by the author, no luck :(
Great, but there are some other tools that are not native python, like sonarqube, invaluable for codeanalysis and technical debt. Also logging and logging aggregation like Elk, Loggly or splunk and Nexus3 repomanager are invaluable apps. I have them running in containers with external volumes, so I can access them via the net, or spin up a new one in a few minutes.
And if you uninstall the package with `pip uninstall InstagramApi` and use `pip install .` from the Instagram-API-python folder.
It’s a feature of PyCharm to inform you that everything went okay. If it would’ve been otherwise, it would give the exception to you.
That’s what I thought. But it gave me that response when I opened up parenthesis and mashed on the keyboard

This is great and all, but your silly toy will never crack ROT13. This very message has been coded with dual rounds. If I upped that to three you wouldn't even be able to read it.
Probably you don't have ffmpeg install or it isn't in your PATH. (See the last line in your stack trace.
Not to be overly pedantic, but [hashing](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function) and encryption are actually two separate concepts. Namely, encryption has to be reversible whereas hash functions like md5 or sha-256 are (ideally) non-reversible beyond performing a brute force lookup.
It's definitely more a simple exercise than anything.
It does matter because if it's enclosed inside a function and you aren't calling the function then it would probably do what you're explaining.
[https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/public\_server.html](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/public_server.html) You can run the server on localhost and share the password with your co-workers but there is no build in isolation to protect you from stepping on each others code, so be sure to checkpoint (or even rename) your notebook file before sharing. &amp;#x200B; This is the line (from jupyter\_notebook\_config.py) that configures the server to only listen to connections made from your host and not to any external connection attempts. # The IP address the notebook server will listen on. # c.NotebookApp.ip = 'localhost'
More seriously though, if I take a 'dividing by two' algorithm from ONE company, if I input "8" as a number, would the result be the same FOR EVERY 'divide by two' algorithm. Hope that makes it clearer! Yes, if implemented properly, the results should always match
Hmm... pydub gives an error on flac files because it uses simpleaudio, and the easiest way to get flac files to run is use _play_with_ffplay instead.
So it's basically just a wrapper around `ffplay`? Neat, but I wouldn't really call it a "sound engine". Also, command injection vulnerability in `loop_file` - you can do arbitrary filesystem writes with that, and probably other stuff too.
Saying you made a sound engine seems a bit deceptive when it's just a thin wrapper around ffplay.
it looks like you need to install `moviepy` lib
Can you? The subprocess command isn't in shell mode, so you can only write one parameter. I don't think you can do `&amp; other function`.
I don't need to - ffplay can write to a file with the right arguments, and IIRC there's even a supported way to invoke an arbitrary binary as a filter.
True enough. It did feel like I was cheating. I didn't want to have the commands for ffplay in the other projects I'd be using them in though, so it made sense to have some other library for them.
Huh. Yeah, that could be a security vulnerability. Might as well enforce a must_be_a_file_string rule then. I think that should make it harder to break things.
I insert a PDF, I select what pages I want and your program outputs a new PDF with only those pages. Go!
I believe I made a mistake not adding __init__.py into my folder structure. Every folder has __init__.py, including root folder of the project. I'll add them into description
The correct way to handle the filenames part, assuming ffmpeg even supports it, is to pass a special argument `--` between the options and the filenames, so something like `ffplay -blah -blah -foo -bar -- $filename`.
&gt; doubt any of the big websites are using md5 Oh, yeah, why use md5 if can just use plain text. Personally I wouldn't be the least surprised - why change something that has worked great the last decade.
&gt; "hello" will have the same hash output for let's say Facebook and Instagram No, Facebook uses plain text so it will output "hello" (and insta is owned by fb so...?)
I recommend you to start playing doing GUI programs with frameworks such as QT or GTK or any other, I don't know how to do this yet so I want to learn soon.
Normally it gives red text with error messages. But it gave no error message. But I did try a string I know works “print(“hi”)” and it did nothing
I like to read job postings to get project ideas.
Alright, fixed &amp; pushed. I also checked that the string passed in was a file, and that 'loops' was an int.
Idle is ole reliable for me haha
Gotta trust the explanation from a guy with a username that is a truth table function.
I’ve just been programming for 6 to 9 months now, and started by making programs that interested me. I tried automating things with selenium and requests in conjunction with bs4. I made some games in pygame as well and basically just tried to use python wherever I felt I could implement it. Just find an aspect that you enjoy and try to become proficient with that.
no, Facebook does not use plain text to store user passwords in their databases. I think you are confusing the recent news where passwords were inadvertently being *logged* in plaintext. There is a difference.
Try running it in the termainal
Mostly it is free and it gives you a server to play on. You can even host your own website from it.
An image classifier these days can amount to only a few lines of code, due to all abstractions available (this isn't a bad thing, but might not be the level OP is looking for). Try training an image classifier on your own task for added difficulty :) Also pytorch is worth checking out as well
Create `my_app.pth` file with content being path to your my\_app directory (like `/home/IDCh/projects/my_app/`) and place that file in your site-package directory (like `/home/IDCh/.virtualenvs/my_app/lib/python3.7/site-packages/my_app.pth`). After that you may do: from submodule2 import part2 Or you may add `projects.pth` with content `/home/IDCh/projects/` and then do: from my_app.submodule2 import part2

Crosspost this to /r/crytography.
That’s a good idea!
Not sorted, indexed somehow. I think binary search trees are popular. Python's dict would have worked well for lookups
Cracking is the correct term for "reversing" hashes. &gt; As far as I know, all those algos are hash algos, therefore can't be cracked but guessed by brute force attack Cryptographic hashing algorithms cant feasible be *inverted*, the only way to crack them is by trying combinations then comparing them.
I never expected this type of response and am thrilled to have had all the valuable input I’ve gotten!
Thank you so much!
A (perfectly spherical) sorted list is exactly as efficient as a BST, both O(log n). Using a BST is not essential—it’s just one way to get the list sorted. The sorting, which must be done to allow efficient lookups, is what’s essential. Design vs. implementation.
asecuritysite.com If you are interested in pen testing stuff, learning the kali tools would be useful. OP has written a simple version of John the ripper.
Nitpick: Brute force is a technical term for a specific type of attack. This is dictionary attack.
Btw, awesome job. I take it that you are interested in crypto?

This isn't really a pentest tool, but it's a good exercise to better understand some aspects of pentest tools and methods
Hashes can't be reversed, but you can find an input that generate a specific hash.
Thanks! To some extent. It was initially what drew me to programming (cracking secret ciphers with python; decent book) but I’m not the strongest with math so I’ve never really delved into more complex elements of cryptography.
&gt;Essentially breaking user passwords was a crossword puzzle. [You say that, but someone literally turned it into a crossword puzzle.](https://zed0.co.uk/crossword/)
I can not understand a word of this comment. Clearly a master hacker have encrypted it with the bestest of cryptoz
Ill try that
Trying to work json/dict into a Pandas Df... Aaggh!
You might be interested in other security topics, like reverse engineering, network vulnerability, web security. You can do all of these without a lot of math - they instead require you to keep a lot of complexity in your head and a lot of creativity, which I feel is much more similar to code-cracking than modern cryptography. At your coding level, I would definitely recommend participating in some CTFs and looking at past questions.
Take a look at [Cryptopals](https://cryptopals.com). They're a series of crypto programming challenges designed to help you understand the various concepts in the field. Since you appear to be a decent programmer, why not take a stab at them? I've been working on them on and off for the past few months. They're definitely tricky and require a lot of thinking (and googling) but helped me get better at understanding crypto. PM me if you want to work on them together. I could certainly use a friend :)
Also, be VERY careful about what you upload to a cloud service. You could get fired if you upload sensitive company information. I’m in this same situation and I installed Anaconda Python rather than risk uploading company data to the cloud. Good luck!
Definitely a good sentiment!
The pth files are just appending the directories to `sys.path`. The script still cannot run as a script and also use relative imports such as from .submodule_2 import part2 I'd recommend setting the `__package__` attribute in the script in order to use this kind of directory structure. It runs the script as part of the full package.
I think you haven't read the op, I'm answering the question and obviously not giving an advice.
What am I missing? He gave the directory structure and as I read it he wants to use relative imports from inside the script, running it as a script.
I deleted my comment as I accused you for something I've done. :-) I thought he's asking a way to do absolute imports.
Yeah I’ll have to check that out. And I’ve been meaning to find someone I can work on projects with. I have a couple cs major friends but they don’t like to code outside of schoolwork. I’ll shoot you a PM!
Automate your automated tasks :). Will help you optimize your workflow if you decide to stick with python. I do a lot of data analysis and I have scripts that automate every kind of visualization that it thinks would be useful-- essentially saves me God knows how long writing Seaborn code. Think of it as a personal tableau that thinks the way you want it to.
Hilarious! Thanks that actually explains it 😊
I can already write plugins with C#, I just wanted a simple way to write little one-off pieces of script. Is there some method I am not aware of? I also use VisualStudio to write those plugins, but if other users want to do a little something, it's not practical (this is for business use). Doing it via python would make it easier for the less savvy.
Why not take in the hashes from a file as well instead of pasting them?
&gt; Two different companies will use different salt which will change the output [Best practice is to have a distinct salt for each password.](https://github.com/OWASP/CheatSheetSeries/blob/master/cheatsheets/Password_Storage_Cheat_Sheet.md#use-a-cryptographically-strong-credential-specific-salt)
&gt; One use I can think of for md5 is checking integrity of files after you copy them locally. Might as well use a simpler checksum for that, unless you've got some kind of md5 hardware acceleration.
A rainbow table is an actual algorithm, more than just a list of precomputed hashes.

They're both one liners you can mention in the readme, I don't think it's as different as you describe. After they install your project, now they need to know how to run it... Which also needs description. `setup.py` also assumes that your code is a full self contained package that wants to run, rather than a gentle one time project made using other stuff.
Question from a brand new Python user. Is it possible to make a program that when a file hits a folder, it gets posted to a website and then sent to two specific email groups then gets printed to a office printer? I would also need it to print eight copies three hole punched. I know this sounds weird but it's something I have to do often and it's annoying. You don't need tk tellw how to so it unless you want to. I just want to know if it's realisticly possible. Thank you.

LOL that's awesome
Protip: `import random ; random.shuffle(deck)` actually works.

holy shit, you can code starcraft bots in python now?
Okay, but the code on my GitHub repo is. I don't know what point you're trying to make but a video is a good way to visually get the point across and the code is included.
It would be, just not the actual one. Rather, the sha256 sum of the sums of those chunks. It was a bug but I kept it, since it's even less likely to get brute forced. However, if the file size is smaller than a chunk it gives the correct sum.
Cool project, i tried it out and it seems to post scraped posts on repeat. seem like it could use a database to check for duplicates? also it seems to only work with an app tokens from the same user who created the app, are there any plans to make authenticate other users? &amp;#x200B; also a typo on readme (should be git): gi checkout -b deploy and on Windows, to activate the bot, I had run the activate.bat on the Scripts folder. The "workon bot" didn't work Thanks and good luck
Ok, ok.
Yes. The specifics depend on a lot of things, like how posting it to a website works, whether you own that website and can just send it to a remote directory on a webserver or have to actually make a request to upload it and how that site takes that upload request, what sort of email service you use (likely has some form of smtp emailing), and I've never programmatically printed something but it's possible. Thing is, anything is pretty much possible with python. At worst, you might have to write some really low level code, or maybe a C library that uses the CPython API. The difficulty and complexity really depends on the way you'd do it normally and if that's easy to automate. You can use [watchdog](https://pypi.org/project/watchdog/) to monitor for changes to the directory, and run code when a new file gets added. [You can send email with python](https://realpython.com/python-send-email/). I mean, this is done all the time for any python website that sends emails, like "Forgot Password" type stuff or validating an email by clicking a link in an email. A quick hacky way is to create a new gmail account, I think you have to enable insecure 3rd party apps or something in its settings, then triggering it with smtp(s). [Gmail](https://stackabuse.com/how-to-send-emails-with-gmail-using-python/) And then with printing, it depends... [This might work,](https://smallbusiness.chron.com/sending-things-printer-python-58655.html) though use `subprocess.call` or `subprocess.check_output` instead of `os.system` since you might have to pass a variable as the filename.
Thank you so much. The good thing is it's a company website. We use outlook for emailing so I dont know how that works. In tryimg to learn to code to automate these types of things. Thanks for the information!
Vim!
No problem! For outlook, I imagine you have outlook installed on your workstation so you want to open it up and [inspect the settings](https://www.wikihow.tech/Find-the-SMTP-Server-in-Outlook-on-PC-or-Mac) to get the host for triggering the email. Since it's a company website, you're in luck because you can literally just talk to the web devs and explain that you want to be able to upload files programmatically, and ask if there's a REST API you can use to do this, and if not, if they could add an endpoint for you. Just tell them you want to use python and [requests](https://2.python-requests.org/en/master/) and ask if they know how you might programmatically do this.
Passwords are supposed to be hashed with a random salt. If they do this then you shouldn't be able to steal passwords and run dictionary attacks on them.
There is good tool dedicated for that. Right now, I think about autobahn / wamp that give you access to rpc and pub/sub in an clean way.
I didn't think of that. Haha porn on the local Govt. Site. That would be bad for PR
Thanks you! That made it clear!!
I did something very similar with Python. I also added a functionality to mutate the dictionary keywords to try and match. For an example, if the dictionary had a keyword of 'hello', my program would try: 'Hello', 'hELLO', hello123' ... etc. It's something you can add on. Here's my github [link](https://github.com/limittox/hash-solve)
How do you make a crossword from it? Like how do you know beforehand than 3rd letter is same in the two passwords?
Happy cake day
Have you tried the following? from unittest.mock import MagicMock a_mock = MagicMock() a_mock._somthing.xyz.trigger.return_value = 'foo' More importantly, you should consider passing an object returned from create to the initializer instead of creating an instance from inside it (this is called dependency injection).
This sub is pretty much split down the middle on PyCharm and VS Code. Of course some people here still use Atom, Vim, Sublime, etc. With extensions VS Code isn't much different than PyCharm. They both do a lot and work great for intellisense support. Maybe not out of the box but still. Best thing to do is compare both IDE's and see which one you like best imo.
Good old “have you tried `import solution`”. Love python!
Yeah, you're right. requirements.txt would be easiest in retrospect. I'll have to refresh my memory on the differences again.
Can you mention specific channel names to fetch music from as the tracks are uploaded?
If you’re looking at numpy arrays, then it’s scientific data, right? Have you considered matplotlib to view the 1D or 2D data? Within the VScode debug utility, you can import matplotlib and simply display the values of your numpy arrays graphically.
Installed VS Code today and really liked it
hashing : 1. Keyed hashing - where the output of every plain text will be different because different keys are used. eg HMAC 2. Unkeyed hashing - where output of every plain text will be same. Eg MD5 hashing and cryptographic encryption are two different things.
If you are using VS Code, ensure you've also installed the python extension.
Pickle is an option.
I just store it in a python file, and then i can import the variables trough the import function
Programs like these are quite simple to write in most modern programming languages that come with cryptographic libraries. The ONLY thing that would make any such program interesting would be the speed at which it operates, be that using single or multi/distributed computing resources. As a learning concept what you have produced is great, but in reality that's where it's usefulness ends.
I never understood the purpose of pickling however i watched a youtube video about it and it seems like exactly what i need.

No problem. I'm a VS Code user myself and enjoy using it a lot. Must have extensions are of course the Python extension, but Code Runner is also great. You will have to follow the instructions [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50689210/how-to-setup-code-runner-in-visual-studio-code-for-python). It runs Python inside the IDE. I use ctrl+alt+n to run my script. I figured out a way to customize the colors of the built in terminal as well which is nice. Another must thing to learn with VS Code are [user snippets](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets). It's pretty easy to learn how to use and makes life a lot easier when programming. [Here's an example](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-python/blob/master/snippets/python.json) of good user snippets in Python.
The second paragraph in the `tkinter` [documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html) explains how you can find out. Also r/learnpython

I mean for quick new styled apps I personally like to use electron. Allows you to use css/html to make the views, and then can have node call your python methods. Tkinter works well but is also hideous 🤷🏽‍♂️
You might have to add it if its not running when you import it. Thenewboston has some pretty good tutorials for tkinter
Something like... for key, value in dictionary_to_merge.items(): If key in final_dictionary: #see if it’s already a list or not, then append or create list Else: Final_dictionary[key] = value Should be as simple as that unless I’m missing something. If you want to impress the lecturer, validate your code using a unit testing framework.
What type of data (tabular, document, relational, graph, etc...)? How large? Do you always load all of it, or sometimes just parts? Does it need to load in any different software? Would you like to edit it in an program like Excel?
IMO you should usually use json before pickle, if at all possible. It's portable and, perhaps more importantly, easily readable with a standard text editor.

If you use Discord, you may think of creating chat bots. I am just a hobbyist programmer at best, but I have made a few using discord.py and enjoy cooking up new things. I host them on a Raspberry Pi 2B, not even a recent model. Works great, though.
Misleading title man..
If you want to go purely by definitions, sure, it’s not accurate. But if you know anything about hashing algorithms you would understand they are one-way, i.e uncrackable. Password cracking is a commonly used term used also by many other programs to describe themself. I see how using “cracked” in conjunction with hashing algorithms could be confusing, but it’s common terminology.
Depending on your skill level, you can have a look at "Impractical Python Projects" by Lee Vaughan. The projects in there are a lot of fun! But as I said, it really depends on how much experience you already have! Luckily though, you can find a description of each project on the book's homepage. So you can check that out before you buy it.
Suggestions: You only need to calculate hashes of wordlist **once**
It is a bit old (...) More in the book ..
No, it's not. Pickle is a serialization format for live objects, code and all. You don't need that. All you need is a serialization format for dumb data. Pickle comes with rather hefty security implications; essentially, your pickle files are code, and that makes it impossible to validate them properly before loading, you have to trust them blindly, more or less. If your data is tree-shaped, use JSON. If it's table-shaped, consider CSV. If it's a more complex shape, look into SQLite.
You're doing brute force stuff in Python? Isn't that pretty slow?
I'm going to look into automation with selenium, sounds interesting. I've also made a few pygames for shits and giggles, but whenever I look for coding ideas on forums and random websites, they never really call to my attention. I'm not sure why. I think I may have found a fun project recently though, a simple flashcard application. I might use kivy for it, not sure. Anyway, thanks for the input. Sounds like you made incredible progress in such little time. Keep it up!
Thank you. Yeah, I have a Kali distro machine and have been playing with the suites. I guess I'm more looking on how to bridge that gap between script kiddie and "professional " hacker (i.e. writing zero day attacks)
Yes, you're right. My mistake. Still would be a fun project to better understand hash algorithms.

Google about daemons in Windows, it's what you need I think
https://www.benfrederickson.com/dont-pickle-your-data/ This might be somewhat outdated, but pickle is also slower than json.
Can you give me a more specific reference? When I search daemons in windows i get daemon tools which is probably not what i need.
*****Shine bright like a daemon*****
Crack is the right term. Back in the 90s we used a free program called [John the Ripper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_the_Ripper): &gt; John the Ripper is a free **password cracking software tool**. Initially developed for the Unix operating system, it now runs on fifteen different platforms (eleven of which are architecture-specific versions of Unix, DOS, Win32, BeOS, and OpenVMS). It is one of the most popular password testing and breaking programs as it combines a number of **password crackers** into one package, autodetects password hash types, and includes a **customizable cracker**. Emphasis mine
How do you feel about storing Matplotlib figures in a Pickle?

Of course, a daemon is a program that runs when system is started, I didn't set up one of this on windows, but in linux is easy and runs in the background, (if you have a laptop, be aware because a bad script can takes too much battery, at least is what was happen to me, but I'm a pretty noob programmer :( I think in Windows it has something to do with this link: [https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/137890](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/137890).
Why do you say stupid? All programmers started somewhere. As long as you understand the code and what every line does, you have learnt Python. Most important thing is, did you enjoy writing it and are you proud of yourself?
Cool :), don't look down on yourself, if you don't have your own back nobody else will :b

check out [hackthebox.eu](https://hackthebox.eu) and look around youtubers for pentesters. it's an extremely broad subject and you just have to dive in and keeeeep learning and eventually you'll start figuring things out &amp;#x200B; a guy i really like goes by Zanidd or /dev/null on youtube. his content is better for newer learners because he himself is no genius 1337 hacker. I watched a playlist he did about a hackthebox challenge and it was really helpful to see him trying and failing at things - whereas most guys just post a video of them knowing exactly what to do and succeeding and it doesn't teach you as much &amp;#x200B; i'm not much of an expert but i'm learning cyber security and here's a couple of python tools i made: &amp;#x200B; \- FileHasher. creates a hash of the given file, then checks a dictionary of hashes (filename,hash). if the file has been hashed before, compare the old hash and the new in order to check for integrity (aka file changes). if the file hasn't been hashed before, store the hash \- MalwareChecker. you give the script a file and it hashes it, then uses the virustotal API to check the hash against their database of known malware for a match \- TCPResetAttack. uses scapy to send TCP reset packets to a target, attempting to end TCP sessions
If you mean Pandas, it has built in support for CSV https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/io.html
I don't use Windows, but I suspect that in pythonw.exe it is not waiting on console io and so it's just running full-tilt on the CPU. Try [time.sleep](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.sleep) inside your main loop. How often do you need to refresh your app? Depending on your use-case you could sleep for 1 second each loop. The longer you sleep for the less granularity your tracker will have but the less CPU you'll use. More sophisticated code will allow you to keep a constant loop speed by measuring how long the last loop took. This is often used in games to ensure a constant refresh rate. I'm assuming you're not using a GUI. If you use a GUI then things change a little. Often toolkits will have a timer that will allow you to call your code every certain length of time, and this is probably what you should do.
Dude, this is awesome! I didn't even know what programming was when I was 14 - kudos to you.

Useless projects bring you experience for build bigger projects. Keep this in mind mate.
Did you learn anything from creating it? If so, it was useful. Keep going. Keep learning. You will do great!
Well I'm 15, just a year older than you :v, I started programming when I was 12, It's not stupid if you learnt from this project it's very nice for you experience in programming, you can't be ashamed of what you've done. Dont worry I've done alot of applications like this and I've learned a lot, mainly on why things must be efficient but if you are a true beginner don't worry about that yet, you will get there in the future
Yup! HDF5 is a great format for large databases (but not that large Big Data pipeline is needed, think 5-40 Gb). You can for example access the data in batches without loading the entire dataset in memory. I've used h5py on a large-ish deep learning project and it worked great. If you need something simpler, json is usually the prefered format.
Every professional feels like a beginner too

It’s easier and faster to encrypt a complete wordlists and creare a txt file with hash:word So the tool will crack the hash faster since it needs only to find the already cracked hash. Example wordlist: 8b1a9953c4611296a827abf8c47804d7:Hello 16272a5dd83c63010e9f67977940e871:Ciao Now that the wordlist is saved as txt file we now create the tool def crack(tocrack): with open(‘md5file.txt’, ‘r’) as f: for hash in f: if tocrack == hash.split(‘:’)[0] return(hash.split(‘:’)[1]) Now you probably asking how can this be useful? Easy, just create another function the encrypt a word and automatically save it in the word list (md5file.txt)
Well, I am 30 and started coding at 28 😂
I just started python and this is pretty damn cool! Would really wanna know how you did this. Could you show your source code you used? On a side note: where did you learn python programming? I’m searching for online resources and would really wanna know a good one.
Wow this is really impressive for a 14 year old! Wish I would have started that early. Keep going man. You will go places!

Hashing Functions != Encryption. Hashes are not meant to be broken as they are whats referred as one way functions. Encryption algorithms are meant to be reversible. Main reason why websites hash passwords is for a few reasons, its generally very reliable, its quick and its predictable in terms of a result (md5 will always return a 32 character string). Hashes are not only useful for hiding passwords but they are also used as a sort of identifier for well really anything because anything you put in will (generally, except in the event of a collision) create a unique signature. Could be text, could be a file. There is a lot you can do to play around with hashes and salting techniques, its one of the main reasons i got into and still enjoy programming. Cheers!
No, that's also why there is virtually no CPU usage on the console application. The loop updates every 2 seconds to check one boolean to break the loop, and every 88 seconds to do the expensive update process. The automation thread that I added, which doesn't require user input anymore, sleeps for a few hours till it's time to stop the execution. It could have something to do with the GUI, considering pythonw crashes when it is asked for input() in the script.

Hm, I converted my script to exe using pyinstaller because the thing from your link only takes Windows NT applications, whatever this is. Then I linked it to this exe.

Thank you!
Thanks a lot man!
Yup, you should invest in learning how to use Git, then make a habit of putting these projects somewhere like GitHub or GitLab.
Most of the time you have to start of useless and practice while being useless for a long time, to get to being useful :D So you now you have made a good start on that journey. You're ahead of all the people who looked at it and said, "nah, I'm good sitting here at the starting line and shouting about how hard things are".
I vote for JSON too, if it is feasible (JSON cannot handle circular references or custom types – use YAML or pickle for that). If you need to serialize lot of data and this data can be expressed as bunch of records then consider JSONL – “one JSON document per Line” (http://jsonlines.org/). Then you don’t have to load into memory everything at once. Tools like jq (https://stedolan.github.io/jq/tutorial/) understand JSONL too.
Ahhh it doesn’t let me open the video :(
Thanks for all the replies! I'm fairly new to python and I havn't gotten a chance to learn any of these modules (except a brief into to pickling). I will try to implement most if not all of these recommendations to get a better feel for each module.
When I created the scrapers initially, Twitter used to eliminate the duplicate tweets by itself (the API used to raise an exception). However, it doesn’t seem to work now - maybe because of hashtags. Yes, I planned to eliminate duplicates, by a short span database of scraped tweets (I think I mentioned it in the comments of either scrapers.py or functions.py). I’m planning to generalise the documentation - sorry that it didn’t work out for you. Check out this [tutorial on DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-scrape-web-pages-and-post-content-to-twitter-with-python-3) I wrote, for details on the scraper aspect of Chirps as well as virtual environment setup instructions that it links to. Thanks for pointing out the typo and thanks for your wishes!
Still proud there even is a Paint alternative. In pure Python, no less. Speaking of alternatives, especially free and Open Source ones, GIMP is probably the best option.
cute!
A teamspeak serverquery chatbot is really fun and you’ll learn a lot about data structures and how to deal with them.
Is SQLite3 a bad option here? It’s easy to work with in my opinion. Unclear on performance so if anyone could clarify that would be great!
GG! Don't stop now, yo. Think of something you can improve for yourself and others and then try to do it using Python or whatever. My first project was a simple script that played some music when a new TV show torrent was out. Think of something that can help you and see what you can do with it.
It's a difficult age to see the value in learning these skills. I've been out of college for a few years and I build "useless" projects all the time. They're not useless though because every project I work on teaches me skills for my next project. The more I fail and learn the better I am. You dont realize how much you have learned until you talk to someone just starting out. Share your skills and experiences. I wish I would have been this good of a programmer at 14. Who knows where I'd be. Awesome keep it up.
&gt; it doesn't feel like the executable is run, since the executable has file system impact when it is run. &gt; &gt;When I run it manually it works though. Unix developers are used to this kind of difference: "it runs manually but not in background/daemon/cronjob mode." When run in the background, it often does not have the same environment that a manually-run script does. Do you assume what directory is the current working directory? Does your script execute sub-tasks which might not be found if the %PATH% weren't set? And so on.
Its primarily object creation however I can edit the data to beter cater to my needs. It only needs to load in python however excel would be a nice touch.
-find an api you like. Currently I'm working on a crypt exchange bot. Twitter can be fun. You can combine multiple api's. -a game. Text adventure is easier with no graphics. Make it more than a 1t minute play. Utilize a db. -get a raspberry pi. Make some home automated tasks.
It's seeing some love for Gitlab
Oh, I'm agreeing with you there - just clarifying that the algorithm may be fooled into being inefficient, but it won't fail outright - if there's a path, it will be discovered *eventually*.
Good Job!
Disagree - we still are, we just got used to the feeling
You made something without having much experience. Don’t call it useless! It was a good start and I hope we get to see your progress in the future :)
Yes, it actually accesses files in the working directory. Here is a (link to my python code)[https://github.com/LoliHaxxer/pot/blob/master/POT.py]. pathogen is the variable that searches for the directory the file is located in. So maybe it would work if I change it to an absolute path?

Give it even until just before the end of grade 12, if you keep this pace up, you'll be an excellent dev. Keep learning and having fun!
Your resource usage shouldn’t be any higher with pythons. That’s just poor measuring by Windows. It’s a non GUI program that probably doesn’t need to be run continuously. You also have a while loop. I’d just stick a few second sleep at the end of the loop.
Sorry dude, you're talking about youtube. I was away from this topic and didn't notice. There's a lot of formulas that you can make/use inside IFTTT. I don't know exactly what do you want, but first, you need to connect your YT, spotify of whatever you looking to get/put, then you can use the pre-made formulas to do what you want automatically. I use IFTTT to sync my playlists from Soundcloud to Spotify. good luck!
Dude u already have a headstart than most folks while I got myself into python in my 40’s. Age should never be a factor!
vscode = G.O.A.T.
Okay, sounds like your program is a little more complex that it sounded at first. How are you suspending execution for 2 seconds or 88 seconds? What GUI toolkit are you using? Are you also running the GUI when you are running under the console?
Hey friend! You have something that works and you've still got years before you're out of school! I, and many others, wish we started out as early as you! You should be proud of yourself for getting started! Especially with something cool like that! Great things ahead of you! Keep it up!
Salted hashes don't protect against dictionary attacks. They *do* protect against rainbow tables. The only way to protect against dictionary attacks is to generate your passwords in a better way (which isn't quite the same as using a "more complex" password).
14?! when I was 14 I was sitting on my ass and playing gta san andreas. &amp;#x200B; I'm 28 now and I'm still sitting on my ass but this time on reddit.
Yes and they're fun too. We all did it, didn't we?
I'm a professional and im still a beginner!
Looks solid, kid. Keep up the cool stuff
IMHO, is not useless then. Experience is basically what make a person a good developer. If you are learning something, it's never useless.
Yep, you're right but also depends how you salt the pw too. If u use an algorithm to combine the salt and password you can make dictionary attacks more difficult.
I just finished a scrapper that: PHASE 1: (Selenium) Sign in (user/pass) Pick a course manually because it's a carrousel element and I wasn't able to deal with selenium (lack of knowledge) Click on any course module to make the class it visible and creates a local directory with the module name Click on each class, create a dir with his name Download all attachments on this page and move to the correspondent class directory. Download source code of current class page inside class dir. &amp;#x200B; PHASE2: Beautifulsoup Open source code and get vimeo URLs and download videos for the classes. &amp;#x200B; Everything with log system and resume in case of failure. Was needed to deal with some exceptions and use some waits because of vimeo dw restrictions.
Don’t stop, never stop.
Hundred of times. And I still do every time I want to learn a new programming language.
There are sleeps everywhere. As stated, running in the console is stated as 0% CPU usage by Task Manager, while using pythonw seems to use 25%. Percent. That's a quarter. I can even hear the fan going typhoon mode.
I'm 35 and still am not at this level yet. I'm still learning the basics. Don't be so down on yourself!
Execution is suspended using sleeping of the threads. Since input() crashes the script. I first amend settings of the script to autorun mode, which skips all input sequences in the following run, disables autorun mode for the next run and automatically executes and then stores the collected data in a .statisthicc file. The GUI shouldn't be used in the script, but is only used to circumvent a console window showing up.
What background music did you use for your video?
I only started learning Python (1st programming language) at age 28. And so far it's opened a lot of doors for me. Seriously, starting at 14 will set one up for wizard status in and after college. &amp;#x200B; One thing I wish I had known earlier is that every profession needs coders. It's not just a web development skill set. Economists, sociologists, and astronauts - to name a few - all use programming. Even if you don't want to major in CS, you're still investing in your future by taking these efforts now :)
Is it getting the job done faster? Test how long it takes to run N loops without sleeps. The way you save power is you use a processor a max capacity and then you turn it off or give it to something else. Processors are constantly switching as well, so you have to run things repeatedly to get a good handle on repeatability. Windows CPU usage is also not that accurate.
Dude I’m 26 and can barely write a function. There are a lot of people that wish they could do what you’re doing at 14. Keep up the hard work!
Let me tell you something..... In the beginning when I was small, I used windows and programmed in vb.net, it's a bug brother of the old vb6. There, i used to frequent a website called hackerforums.com. This site had a vb.net section. I used to go there and see in awe all the clever(at that tine) things people used to make. I also got interested in making ui of applications. These UIs were classes that your program can inherit and it would look like that. All the drawing on these uis were done using gdi+, a type of rasterization used by windows in the old days. It consisted of statements like drawline, fillrect, etc. EVERYTHING was made by these statements. And i was mad for it. Eventually, i met a god(in my eyes), namely Aeonhack and saw his posts. I started building on his themebases to make something better, different than everyone else. I was planning to make a complete themesuit for your application complete with skinned controls, smooth animations, anti aliasing etc. Most of these things were unheard of the vb.net theme world. But as I kept at it, I developed my skills. I made small controls and themes bases and tutorials. My audience was very small, a miniscule portion of internet, filled with edgy people and even in that, those who chose to visit the vb. Net section. Not to mention, the crowd at hackforums was very unwholesome and rude in general. You haf to really do something serious to even get noticed there. Among those, there were some people like zilog, ninja, mavamarteen etc who inspired me. But still, I kept doing it cause I loved it. These themebases are heavily based on oop concepts so that helped. Finally, i released my 1st version of my themesuit and posted it. It was completely different from anything that had been posted on that forum before. And i got praised! (•‿•) For the first time in my life, I was recognized on the internet for doing something. Ans this made me very happy. Now, looking back at those github repos, it would seem lame and even stupid to make such a thing, something that almost no one uses, but i have safe on my account and it is there for everyone to see. I consider it as an achievement, my first big programming project. Lookibg at it all these years later is a very satisfying feeling for me, i can proudly say that yes, i mastered oop in 8th grade thanks to this, i learned how to use git thanks to this, i learnt to have self confidence thanks to this. No project is stupid if you put enough effort into it.

Lmao I did the exact same thing when I was 14 in my first year of school comp sci. Im pretty sure I didnt put that project on github though, there was a problem with adapting the cursor (a turtle) to keeping the offset with certain screen resolutions. Nevertheless this is well done, great job. 👍🏻
&gt;\- Since most students find this assignment to be somewhat more difficult, I will give many hints if you ask me to in the Discussion forum.
And the best ones still are. :-)
We all start somewhere stick with it you're doing great
Nice job! Keep at it and in a few years you could easily be interning or doing Google Summer of Code.
Quite good regardless of your age, keep it up and keep exploring python more and more!
The first thing I ever coded was a really shitty version of Flappy Bird on my graphical calculator, called Flappy X. And yet I was so damn proud of it, and it started a hobby that's now gonna be my career. 14 is a great age to learn code, keep at it! The more you practice the better you'll get, and it never stops being super rewarding.
It’s not a unit test if it takes 15+ minutes to run. All my 889 tests run in 9 minutes and they’re not all unit tests. A unit test is small. An integration test is more of a line in the sand test, but is incredibly difficult to prove it’s correct. You may prove it doesn’t crash, but that’s not the same thing as calculate the area of a single triangle that you worked out to be 2.
Ewww...just store the data in an numpy npz binary file. Replot the data.
That’s actually an incredibly fast way to do it.
Lol when I was 14 I wrote bash scripts that opened explorer.exe 10.000 times
Well my channels name is python with jackhammer u can check it out there
It's not a tutorial dude, it's video of you creating a shitty clicker window without explaining anything. Like letsplay, but letscode. Actual crytique: Why only place? Where are pack and grid? We don't need to use pack, but WHAT PACK IS? What's the difference between minsize and geometry? No explanation in video From when mainloop() opens windows? What if i want 2 windows? 2 mainloops? Why do you teach everybody to use global variables? WHY FOR GOD'S SAKE Global variables are bad, and your functions cannot be used more than once
