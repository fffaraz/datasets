With that logic Haskell would be really popular since it's the first language being taught in many European universities.
If you really care about your employability: check Indeed in your area for your language of choice. You will see if you are still relevant. Questions and GitHub stars are a small portion of the community. I teach Python in college, but I also teach my students the choice of language for a project is a strategic choice for most companies.
Going to be adding payloads and support for Linux tomorrow. Also planning on implementing a way to create Payloads from the program itself. 
If you don't have enough experience in python and web app development go with Django. Flask only looks simple when you do simple things.
It's worse than a poor metric. The number of questions indicate the number of people having problems with the language. It doesn't indicate necessarily that strictly more people are using the language, it indicates *also* that more people find the language difficult to use or that it has frustratingly frequent edge cases. It probably also indicates other factors that aren't controlled for, so I feel comfortable declaring that it's not a bad metric. It's *not even* a bad metric.
Back ends or pythons?
I won't say Node is the worst. It's *not even* the worst. It's so far off the plot that it doesn't even make sense to rank it relative to anything.
I thought Ruby was still loved these days?
Trying to augment xonsh with the ability to pass objects between python functions instead of just strings, so I can write something like pyls | where lambda f: f.size &gt; 1024 It's a bit challenging, because the idea of text pipes are built very strongly into xonsh..

&gt;My company started rewriting our GA framework in C++ last month. Yeah, it's more typing, but it just works. We won't have to deal with bugs 3 years down the line that are hard to track down because one function 10 layers up the stack trace returned None No, you'll have bugs much worse than that and messy code that's hard to read. Python has Type Hints now which helps. 
What is wrong with white men? I thought everyone were the same so why does it matter whether they are white or not? I mean, if everyone is the same whether or not there are white men, brown men, women, yellow men, whatever is completely inconsequential... because they are all the same... right? &amp;#x200B; ... And if they are not the same why should we legislate similarity? After all, they are not the same.
You're obviously not from around here.
does it work without xserver?

I was going to say that if I am already on Xserver then why not just open the image but then I realized it can be useful if I want to quickly see an image on remote server without having to download it first 
Just use black instead? :)
I've just submitted a PR that adds Linux support (and macOS/cywin, hopefully).
I tried with all the good will I had. However, it mutilates the code to such an extent that for both me and everyone I know it is far too brutal :D Personally, I see the problem with black that its formatting is surprisingly far from the standards I know as well as from the code I assumed to be perfectly sweet and readable.
Does smokeping test throughput as well as latency?
there are a myriad of scripts and tools that do this...
nobody with an answer??
I checked many programs which claimed to do the same. But most of them either required some extra dependencies for terminal or were very simple ASCII image browsers. For example, cacaview is an ASCII image browser. Take a look at this comparison: ![](https://i.imgur.com/BUQdUxb.png) Left one is generated by cacaview whereas right one has been generated by my script. :)
No extra os related dependency has been used in this script. All you need is a linux terminal on which ANSI color palette can be rendered.
Look again, please: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grail\_(web\_browser)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grail_(web_browser)) \- no converting necessary. Just use `&lt;script type="python"&gt;` (or something) and go for it. Probably better to use `type="python3"`, these days.. ;) And yes, this is from our great Ex-BDFL!!! My theory: it was Tk, breaking the Grail's neck by being to ugly (sorry!) for Apple-Computer based influencers. ^((Just kidding! I'm completely aware of the many ugly things that happened during the browser wars. Also:) **^(not)** ^(sorry!))
I prefer things like this for projects of this type: https://pypi.org/project/tinydb/ No need to complicate your stuff with creating databases and tables and schemas. This just writes json. Save SQL for when you need things like transactions and joins. NoSQL is fine for something like this. Other caveats: Your sleep schedule in this script is subject to the execution time of the script. It will drift and be somewhat random, not being exactly on the minute. It may be more beneficial to defer the scheduling of it to an OS level tool. Cron or scheduled tasks. Or you can run your task in a separate process. I love the &gt; except KeyboardInterrupt: It's essential to catch that in scripts like this and I don't see enough people do it for a clean exit. Just some over the top ideas from a DevOps engineer. 
r/titlegore
...yes and? Some core developers have more competence and experience than others.
lol that's how I felt about YAPF. It absolutely mutilated the code I tried it on. It didn't improve a single thing and I saw several horrendous effects (e.g. this weird staircase effect on dicts). Black didn't necessarily look much better, but it enforced consistency to their standard and even though I felt like I could do prettier by hand, their standard works well enough for me.
Ball pythons, in particular, are a more popular pet lately.
I started using the 'bpython' repl. Gives me IDE like completion/selection and is just generally more enjoyable for this kind of exploratory work. It's in the cheese shop.
As if reminding someone of the nature of open source makes me a SJW...
that comparison is stupid. here's a good example script that does what yours does, but better: [https://github.com/JonnoFTW/img\_term/blob/master/img\_term.py](https://github.com/JonnoFTW/img_term/blob/master/img_term.py)
[Permanent](https://help.github.com/articles/getting-permanent-links-to-files/#press-y-to-permalink-to-a-file-in-a-specific-commit) GitHub links: * [JonnoFTW/img_term/.../**img_term.py** (master → 35f0f40)](https://github.com/JonnoFTW/img_term/blob/35f0f40b98b36d985079dc8a7d8e6064ac3ec86d/img_term.py) ---- 
When you go with the defaults, YAPF wreaks havoc :D However, after tweaking for a couple of hours I got what I wanted (except for comprehensions this topic is about! and deeply nested dicts/JSONs). All in all, with black I would keep my code consistent yet my eyes would be extremely dissatisfied. And here comes YAPF, which offered me a great reward in return for the time invested in tweaking its settings. I would love black, just like I love `gofmt`, as long as it would have acceptable default config.
The argument is not that all humans are identical at any given point in time. It's that the distributions of what populations are capable of given the right environment are not nearly as different as current "outcome" data would suggest due to systemic biases, and also that because every individual sits on a distribution, one should not be excluded purely because of the subpopulation they belong to. Take basketball as an example. The average height in China is lower than it is in the US, and consequently few people of Chinese descent play in the NBA. However, that doesn't mean that Chinese people should be explicitly excluded from the NBA, because obviously all populations have outliers - see Yao Ming. The professional thing to do, in fact, is to encourage an environment where Chinese people are not berated for being Chinese. Furthermore, while it's generally been considered that the height distribution in China is due purely to genetics, recent changes in diet among Westernised East Asian people have seen the average height skyrocket - given the same environment as Americans, we could easily see a lot more NBA-worthy people of Chinese descent. Software development is very much centered around university-educated English-speaking people who haven't had a systemic bias against them pursuing STEM. Shocker, most of those are white men. That has a great deal of inertia - it reinforces outdated stereotypes and a monoculture governing body is generally very bad at considering issues which don't affect that monoculture (as we can see in this very thread). Qualification for a governing body is not just about the right now - it's about the future. By not investing in broadening the governance, we are contributing to the continuance of that monoculture and implicitly driving away entire swathes of potentially extremely valuable contributors.
I would not call this a cookbook, it's pretty brief.

How does it compare to IPython? IPython has completion and other stuff like being able to view function signatures, docstrings, and source code.

I also think that using sqlite is a non-issue, but to play devil's advocate, JSON is pretty readable even when read with a normal text editor. Personally, I would have opted for a csv file format to have an output format that even a non-technical person can work with (plenty of gamers that want to know these stats but don't know how to program, so you might get better adoption that way). 
Making a Flask app would most likely be easier. But, then you'd have a web app not a desktop gui app. IMO it's really hard to find good tutorials for any Python gui libraries. I think I saw a `getting started with PyQt5` post in this sub relatively recently.

&gt; CoCs are the first step in officially making a commitment to reduce assholery, though, and forking a project specifically to thwart the maintainer's anti-asshole efforts - What kind of unicorn and fairytale world do you live in? CoCs do not "officially" do anything. They aren't legal documents. And historically there have been cases of them being too vague and then used as a weapon against people, or people fucked over because their general use of language is more "offensive" than others. For example I come from a culture where at least 25% of my behavior involves profanity. You say "you're being unreasonable" and I would say "you're being fucking assinine". But I'd be kicked out because I decided to express myself in the manner that everyone around me would have expressed themseleves to me. &gt; manufacturing a safe space specifically for prejudiced, unprofessional people in order to make it easier to exclude minorities - does somewhat imply a pro-asshole stance. Except that's not why people have a problem with CoCs. Remember that vagueness and cultural relativism? That's why people are against CoCs. Because they don't take that into account. Whereas without a CoC, it is the leaders' responsibility to kick generally agreed assholes out and the community's responsibility to fork if the leaders protect the generally known asshole. If I say "this function is shit" to you, I'm not an asshole, I'm saying it how my culture would, and it possibly is indeed shit. If I consistently say everyone's code is shit and do nothing but be rude when asked "can you elaborate", then I'm a true asshole and need to be kicked out. And if I'm not kicked, then everyone who sees my assholery needs to make a fork.
My mom did not buy a Rasberry Pi
Totally! You can find it via my website (http://connerlane.net) 
OOOhhhh.....This is a great idea! I'm not one to use a dedicated sqlite db, so I'm going to create something that will log data to Prometheus. PM for details - it'll be done sometime today/tomorrow-ish.
UR the best Connor! 
I did something similar to this before for a research project when I was in college. We wanted to find all inbound links for Page X within Y clicks. The exponential growth of execution time was outrageous as the degree of separation increases. I really didn't want to get banned by Wikipedia for hitting the site so many times.
No u (╭☞ ͡° ͜ʖ ͡° )╭☞ 
Yeah the branching factor is huge
is this a joke?
There's no query language... that's the point... Also pip... pip install. This is Python. New requirements should absolutely not scare you. Just like gems in ruby. 
Because json. The universal language of all the things.
The script dumps the database tables to CSVs when closed (via keyboard interrupt), but that's admittedly lacking for long-running tasks. A command line flag could be added to perform the CSV dump without running the test scheduler.
I have been trying to get it to work and keep running into an invalid syntax error. Do you know what maybe causing it? root@DietPi:~# python img-viewer.py dog.jpg File "img-viewer.py", line 17 return f"\x1b[48;5;{int(get_ansi_color_code(r,g,b))}m \x1b[0m" ^ SyntaxError: invalid syntax
It's actually 2 tables, one for pings and one for speedtests, but they're JOINable by timestamp.
&gt; New requirements should absolutely not scare you Sysadmin here, that's not a good mindset
&gt; Did you realize you are presenting a perfect example of where it was faster to use another language and then use python as the interface? Saying numpy is really just a python interface for c code is sort of like saying Python is just a wrapper for c. At some point you have to stop. If it was Pyqt or something, then yes you would have a point. numpy is python.
Or, since it looks like OP is into ML, have your algorithm learn where the links are found on the page over time. That would be super cool too
This solution also sounds like it would drain WikiPedia's servers a little less.
This would be great for the wiki game
If I understand what entrust is, I think so. 
It seems you are using Python 3.5 or less. f-strings are a new feature added to Python 3.6+. Just replace `return f"\x1b[48;5;{int(get_ansi_color_code(r,g,b))}m \x1b[0m"` with `return "\x1b[48;5;{}m \x1b[0m".format(int(get_ansi_color_code(r,g,b)))` 
Yeah, that is one thing that is easy to get confused about
PyCharm CE is great.
I like StrictYAML for such purposes, but TOML is more popular and well known among the community
I mean, you could just fork the project on GitHub and replace the sqlite bits with whatever you need.
My group at work uses wxpython and wxformbuilder for design. There are lots of wxpython/formbuilder examples out there.
Hey that’s a good idea. I might try that
Haha yeah that one is fun 
&gt; CoCs do not "officially" do anything. They aren't legal documents. No, but an organisation adopting one (and by adopting, I mean actually enforcing) does do something. I'm not sure I understand your point - you're criticising a CoC's vagueness but promoting the use of a much more vague, opaque, and arbitrary system. A CoC is just a set of guidelines for what sort of behaviour would lead to the community generally agreeing that an asshole should be kicked out, and giving the leader something to point to when that person is kicked out, to say "you were warned". It reduces the power of bad actors to arbitrarily drive individuals out (based on prejudice or other assholery), which I'm almost certain is a more common issue than people "CoC trapping" someone to get them kicked out. &gt; For example I come from a culture where at least 25% of my behavior involves profanity. You say "you're being unreasonable" and I would say "you're being fucking assinine" In a professional setting, your first meeting with a potential client or something similar?
I don't know if Windows's ping tool supports checking the routing chain, but that's certainly an interesting idea. I just went with pinging Google since the issue will almost always be somewhere on my ISP's end (and it's a hell of a lot easier heheh)
Is it possible that the cesspools of the internet are not the best places to take cues from when it comes to setting standards of professional conduct? What content am I missing out on with reddit's 'censorship'?
It does not appear to.
I'm interested here too because, as with packaging, this landscape is hard to navigate. Between, flake8, pylint, then pycodestyle or pylama... why can't we respect the "one preferred way to do things"?
Are you able to find Two Wikipedia pages that does not have a connection?
&gt; Our preliminary results show that developers adopt static analysis tools to check code style conventions only. I think that's totally backwards. The primary reason I do it is to check for errors and warnings. There are often false positives on the errors, so take them with a grain of salt, but warnings (e.g., unused variable x), usually is because you typo'd something or forgot to implement a feature. I also fix the spacing and line width because I just want pylint to shut up.
Working on a program for automatically tracking fast (relative to asteroids and comets) moving objects with a telescope using OpenCV for video tracking. It uses a simple algorithm I wrote to find the local minimum difference between a reference image and the current image. It then averages the reference frame with the current frame so that it is adaptive to changing lighting, perspective and target shape. The reference frame is created by left clicking a targeting box on the webcam window, and for target box sizes up to about \~50 pixels it will generally be limited only by the webcam frame rate rather than by the speed of the program. This will be integrated with a telescope control loop to keep a GOTO capable telescope pointed at the object.
You da bomb. I glanced over the PR; code looks good, I really appreciate that you added named groups to the regexes. I'll give it a test on Windows when I have time, hopefully at some point today.
I think the answer to this really depends on your focus. Are you interested in keeping the style of the document consistent across developers? Are you wanting to catch bugs? Are you interested in adhering to a standard? Additionally, I think the answer depends on how important those factors are and how much effort you're willing to sink on every commit to adhere to the tools you're using. I am of the opinion that readability is really important, but that static analysis is only a small portion of the story when it comes to python and quality. Additionally, I think that pylint is aging and less on point than something like mypy for what it does. I feel like pylint is overly verbose in comparison to flake8 and mypy is more likely to catch actual bugs. So if I were making the decision today, I'd use flake8 to create a consistent style, and mypy to make development less likely to create errors. That said, I also want to make a final statement. Type annotations are completely ignored by the processor. They're developer friendly, but a good docstring tends to have the same effect. Mypy doesn't work on docstrings and _can_ catch bugs, but in my code bases so far (about 1 million lines total), I've not found many bugs through mypy. Most bugs I find tend to sit around inappropriate logic and a lack of good tests around exercising an API vs actual type problems with the API itself. That said, Python interfaces nearly always require exercising the interface to figure out the exact type required when they do not include an actual type annotation. TLDR; use flake8 and mypy. 
Someone remind me which song that is?
First of all, your script is amazing! Secondly, I ran into two other issues that I will list here in case other users will need help running this. You need to install both of these packages in order for it to work: apt-get install libatlas-base-dev apt-get install libopenjp2-7-dev Now I can browse images using RTV (terminal reddit python client) and it works great! 
Try https://github.com/manatlan/wuy It's done for that !
I actually considered using the dumps before I made this. While I acknowledge that it’s faster and friendlier to Wikipedia, the problem is that the dumps are all pretty old. IIRC the newest one I saw was from like 2008

I don't know. Maybe it's just folks liking to approach a problem their own way to learn something new. Either way, it is sometimes annoying not to know which tool to pick.
Are you talking about [ctypes](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html#structures-and-unions)? 
Oh, it seems like these two packages are required by the pillow library. It seems you are not using some regular linux distro, that's why the need to install these packages exclusively. Thanks for sharing!
It's going to be in a public git repo, but I do most of my work in GitLab, and it's tied to my real name. With Prometheus, I don't really need to do a lot of the stuff you've written in your script, so there's not much benefit to forking. I'll make sure I attribute the inspiration somewhere in the readme or script comment though.

I don’t, sorry 🙏 It depends on your internet connection and the amount of content on the page 
&gt; No, but an organisation adopting one (and by adopting, I mean actually enforcing) does do something. So is it official or is it not but "does something" because you say so? Which is it? If the former, you are bullshitting. If the latter, you are making a claim which is impossible to emperically back up. &gt; I'm not sure I understand your point - you're criticising a CoC's vagueness but promoting the use of a much more vague, opaque, and arbitrary system My system is not more vague, it is more lenient to contexts by imposing a sense of democracy in determining whether or not someone's an asshole rather than the "they offended me and only me so kick them out even though such language is common amongst their culture". &gt; A CoC is just a set of guidelines for what sort of behaviour would lead to the community generally agreeing that an asshole should be kicked out, and giving the leader something to point to when that person is kicked out, to say "you were warned". It reduces the power of bad actors to arbitrarily drive individuals out (based on prejudice or other assholery), which I'm almost certain is a more common issue than people "CoC trapping" someone to get them kicked out. Yes. Except they are used as weaponry instead disregarding context and applying it to the individual level treating the complainer as a victim without considering the person the complaint is against. &gt; In a professional setting, your first meeting with a potential client or something similar? I can't tell exactly what you're trying to say, but I'm assuming you're asking if I've done my example in professional settings-- yes, I have. Indeed I have done "worse". And others have done "worse" to me. I have been told "I wouldn't wipe my ass with this module" and I have said "this is fucking ugly sphagetti and to be honest you should be ashamed-- you tricked the linter into accepting it". I have not done such nor heard such, in say, an interview, but I have heard and said "this &lt;profanity&gt;" when describing a variable or lines or whatever.

I love creating content related to Python Programming Language. I recently came up with this comprehensive playlist which discusses various concepts related to dataclasses in detail. Do check it out and let me know your suggestions, if any.
Don't take it personally, that person was an ass. Great work and please keep it up.
Just for ease of other's access By docs campbellm means the README on GitHub, [link to section here](https://github.com/msiemens/tinydb#query-language). The relevant section in the documentation is called [Queries](https://tinydb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html#queries).
I hadn't ever heard of this library but checked out the site, it is neat, but as a novice user of Pycharm, I don't see the need for it. I took code that Pycharm auto formatted and dropped it in and saw minimal difference. Perhaps someone will chime in with something that sets it apart in that regard? One situation that comes to mind is if you can't install an IDE with auto formatting due to admin restrictions, this could be helpful. What is your use case versus the alternatives?
There's no answer that will please you, just use what you know and don't ask questions.
The point of code styles and formatteres is that everyone who looks at and contributes to the code will be seeing/committing code styled in the exact same way. It's not about Pycharm or Black having better auto-formatting, it's about enforcing a consistent style across all team members and potential team members. If you have code that will never be used by other people, you still should consider your future self "other people".
Fair enough!
Either so it all through API calls e.g. have some context creation/destruction routine, or write a native extension for Python. The latter won't be portable between python implementation though.
Sure enough, I had forgotten about `tracert`.
This is awesome. Is the local minimum difference algorithm only looking for the fast objects? Or does it also deal with stars looking slightly different from one picture to another? I'd imagine the atmosphere and half pixel movements make the stationary stars appear to 'move' too?
Could you use this to test the idea that all links in Wikipedia lead to Hitler? (or that it takes few links to get to him?) 
**GOT IT** So, basically, the color attribute I was seeing everyone set through the various attributes (like degree of centrality, etc...) was done through a color map instance, but that is NOT required for setting sets of nodes as different colors or sizes. The key here is the way the ColumnDataSource (CDS) was constructed. By using the line: nodes_source = ColumnDataSource(dict(x=nodes_xs, y=nodes_ys,name=nodes) There is no assignment of color or size as an attribute. Worse, I wasn't able to see what the CDS actually *looked* like. So, I experimented and found that I can add: node_color=pd.DataFrame.from_dict({k:v for k,v in network.nodes(data=True)},orient='index').color.tolist() color = tuple(node_color) nodes_source = ColumnDataSource(dict(x=nodes_xs, y=nodes_ys,name=nodes, **_color_= color**) This assigned the attribute that I retrieved from networkX as a value for each node as a function of its ID, passed it to a tupple, then placed it in the CDS which will be retrieved by asking the Bokeh construction to retrieve data from the column who's name is passed as a** STRING**: plot = figure(plot_width=800, plot_height=400,tools=['tap', hover, 'box_zoom', 'reset']) r_circles = plot.circle('x', 'y', source=nodes_source, size=10,**fill_color="_color_"**, level = 'overlay') Worked like a champ. In retrospect, I probably don't need to pass it to a tuple, but I was curious as to how to interject the data into the CDS in a way it allowed.

Snap! Learned scraping today, so made a script to log into an aspx page and pull down data based on content of an Excel sheet. It's let me partially automate a monotonous manual task at work. This was my first real-world python project, so I'm pretty darn pleased with it. Next step will be to automate the collection of the worksheet data in the first instance, to fully automate the entire process.
You need to pass the fully qualified path for gecko driver file. 
Fair point! That makes total sense, so it's better to just ensure that some "tool" is used to keep that consistency then.

&gt; Which is it? A code of conduct, that is, a text file thrown into your repo, does nothing. An organisation saying "We will be officially adopting and enforcing this code of conduct, which we will also place a copy of in our repo" is a commitment to do something, just like an organisation saying "we will throw out assholes" is a commitment to do something. &gt; Except they are used as weaponry As I said in my post, I'm almost sure that such instances of CoC abuse are rare compared to the abuse of a lack of CoC (or enforcement thereof). That is, I strongly suspect that there are many more assholes going unpunished than there are people weaponising CoCs. &gt; I have not done such nor heard such, in say, an interview, but I have heard and said "this &lt;profanity&gt;" when describing a variable or lines or whatever. This is my point - your behaviour among coworkers is the business of your culture and work environment. If you all have that kind of attitude to each other and you all know that you'll all accept it, that's fine. That's a fundamentally different proposition to an open source project, though, which is necessarily outward-facing, just like you would be in an interview or client meeting or whatever. Swearing is not in any way related to this point. Nobody is proposing banning contributors for saying naughty words. It's specific personal attacks, or unconstructive disparagement, which are unprofessional, and I think you know that. You may be fine with it and you may know your coworkers are fine with it, but open source projects broadcast their culture to potential new contributors, to downstream users, and so on - it's outward-facing. What's wrong with showing some civility when it comes to giving feedback to a new contributor? At the very worst, couldn't you manage a neutral "X needs to be improved in Y way" rather than "you horsecock-gobbling seminal ooze, what kind of negroid hysterical spic do you have to be to write X without Y". Open source is in the game of trying to get more people to invest and contribute. What do you have against showing some basic professionalism to further that aim?

One thing is extensions, plugins, requirements, etc., they're part of what we all do and very necessary. Another completely different is "This is 2018! Just install the 27 requirements for this program! It's easy!", and then you end up with so many dependencies to the point that you can't control what you have in the machine because you really don't know. Having little dependencies is a good thing. On a dedicated Docker image that only has the single app with it's dependencies it makes more sense, of course, but on standalone servers it's not a good habit at all.
I don't really know what your end goal is, but to summarise: You use a for-loop to iterate through something that gives you a set sequence of values. For instance, something = [5, 6, 9, 3] for num in something: print(num) would print each number in the list `something` one by one. You can check if a list, tuple or some other supported container contains a specific value using the `in`-keyword: if 6 in something: print("Found it!") If needed, lists also have built-in methods that let you remove or add values to them.
&gt; On the build server, in the IDE, ...? both. &gt; Do you tend to enable different warnings in different contexts or do you rely on the same configuration? The same. That seems like far too much work to setup. I obviously focus on different things between the build system's more global approach and look more in depth on my local computer, but the list is the same. Flake8 vs. pylint also have a different definition of what a warning is. I go with the pylint definition (e.g., accessing private methods or unused variables/functions are warnings, missing docstrings or long lines are not).
This is awesome, thanks

Thanks for checking that for me. Those are the correct IP addresses. I wonder why on my MacBook or iPhone I'm not getting the IPv6 address along with the IPv4. I'm using the exact same function as you are. Maybe its something with Wi-Fi/network. Oh and you won't be able to connect to the server unless you connect to it on the right port.

You could try out [Nuitka](http://nuitka.net/pages/overview.html) that translates Python into C while making lots of optimizations. Then devs claim it’s 3 times faster than pyston (although they refer to “pystone”, which is a benchmarking script for Python, but I’m assuming they’re talking about pyston). If you want to embed a scripting language into your game, you probably should go for lua because it’s been designed for this very purpose, so it’s tiny yet powerful. 
Hey, thanks for the suggestion! I decided to store geckodriver.exe in the same directory as Firefox itself, which is how I have my PATH set up. Based on your suggestion, here's what I tried: driver = webdriver.Firefox('C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Mozilla Firefox\\geckodriver.exe') This threw an error about an invalid directory, so I removed the geckodriver.exe at the end and did this: driver = webdriver.Firefox('C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Mozilla Firefox') This seems to run without any errors, but I still run into the same issue where Firefox opens up, but doesn't navigate anywhere. It just sits there at a blank tab and eventually closes out. I do see this error... &gt;selenium.common.exceptions.InvalidSessionIdException: Message: ... but there's nothing after Message. Any ideas?
Oh damn, that's really slick! Nice work!
I think people mis the point of Python. Python doesn’t exist to be fast, after all it is interpreted, it exist to make programmers fast. Very few language can do both and frankly only Apples Swift comes close at the moment. To put it another way if you need very fast performance out of your code Python is the wrong choice in many cases. The qualification here is that Python has had many libraries written in C/C++ that can make some apps fast enough. But in generalPython focuses ondeveloper performance not code performance. I really don’t understand the constant inquiries about Python performance. Easy is your trade off when choosing Python. 
Need to check out what's on Binging With Babish first.
Oh, I didn't realize they provide regular dumps. Thanks for letting me know. :)
You are incrementing your month to 13 and then using that value before you try to fix it. There is not key 13 in your dictionary so it fails. You need to change your if statement to 'if month &gt;= 12:' or something like that.

So the situation is that there are multiple proposals for the governance model, which will presumably be debated and voted on. &amp;#x200B; (I'm just stating this point to clarify; I'm not making any arguments one way or another.)
You didn't answer my question. I run an open source library. I care about users first, not new features. So which versions of python should I support? &gt; You can’t keep supporting the Python 2 series forever. In the end you will end up with another COBOL! That's a false dichotomy fallacy. EOL for Python is at the end of next year. I don't intend to support a 40 year old past EOL version of python. As I said, what do I really get for ONLY supporting the latest version of Python, which by the way is not on TravisCI yet? Python 3.7 was released 6-8 months ago...
Some core developers have a greater degree of experience than the rest.
Thanks, I'll check that out too. :)
Neither am I-- just making it clear that the email you referenced is for a different model than the one the post is.

The first thing to consider about the mock library is "first try and figure out a way *not* to use it". Realistic tests are extremely useful and severely underrated.
You need to be more specific. List the functions. UI ( as in HTML) can be done fast when using a framework (i.e bootstrap). But you also need some logic. Maybe store data (crate data model), login user(s), change password, upload files, etc. 
thanks, that seems quite impressive
Game development requires performance. 
When in doubt on dimensions, print the shape of both sides, so: x[:,numpy.arange(0,8),:,0,0].shape It's (10,10,10) and not (10,9,10).

Have you thought about downloading the [Wikipedia database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Database_download) and building a graph out of all pages? I'm not sure how big it'd be to serialize the graph but that would make it substantially faster to search and also let you see what pages have the furthest distance, closest distance, and most direct references.
&gt; or have two parameters of 'interface= ' This definitely won't work. Keyword parameters are passed as a dict, and dicts can't have two separate entries with the same key. (Trying to pass a keyword parameter twice actually throws a SyntaxError, but even if it let you do it the above issue means that the receiving function wouldn't be able to receive the two separate values.)

Game engines need to be performant, those are written in C/C++ or similar languages. What matters is for the engine and what you ask of it to be optimized. What language you write the high level game logic in has a negligible impact.
Am I the only one who generally doesn't like PEP 8 or what?
Thank ya! It’s just statically hosted on AWS S3. Nothing fancy 
Absolutely haha. That was one of the first things I tried. I’ve tried thousands of starting points (i wrote a separate script) and I’ve yet to find one page that was more than 3 clicks away from Hitler 
It’s a BFS https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search
**Breadth-first search** Breadth-first search (BFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the tree root (or some arbitrary node of a graph, sometimes referred to as a 'search key'), and explores all of the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to the nodes at the next depth level. It uses the opposite strategy as depth-first search, which instead explores the highest-depth nodes first before being forced to backtrack and expand shallower nodes. BFS and its application in finding connected components of graphs were invented in 1945 by Konrad Zuse and Michael Burke, in their (rejected) Ph.D. thesis on the Plankalkül programming language, but this was not published until 1972. *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Python/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28
it is alright. Glad yapf isn't the only option 
Yes
Link dump and Dijkstra?
There are probably a lot of small incomplete pages that don’t link to any other pages or have circular references to a small graph of pages. For big pages I highly doubt it. 
[Big O](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation?wprov=sfla1) is your friend.
Just curious, are you an attorney? I ask because I've seen a few posts by attorneys saying they program in Python and have incorporated using Python in there practice. There are only certain types of information that's going to go on a caption page (e.g. contact info; title of the court, title of the case, nature of the paper/pleading, case number), in addition to the 28-lined court papers, with footer, page numbering, and line separating the page number and footer. That's what I'm asking whether or not it's possible to automate those entries with Python. Thanks.
Pip -r requirements.txt
Ok I see how it works. requirements.txt has to be maintained manually right?
Depends. If you have a working environment set up you can generate it via pip -freeze. And I think that an IDE such Pycharm can help you as well because it has its own package manager for the project you’re working on

I am not an attorney. I work in bioinformatics and because dna can be considered to be a language, I'm also interested in natural language processing. That's a good deal more helpful of an explanation of what you're looking for. I don't know what the "28-lined court papers" means though, or what the source material looks like. Still, because you're looking for some highly formatted information (title of court, case, etc) a good deal of it could be automated. There's a chance you can't automate everything, but you should be able to write a program to do a lot of it for you. If you're new to python, I recommend "Automate the Boring Stuff" as it's a good introduction to both python and automation. and explains a lot of the components you'll need. It should help you significantly in this task. I also recommend the /r/learnpython sub for future questions. They wont do the work for you, but they'll help guide you to a solution that works for you assuming you give enough detail about your problem when you ask. This post also should have been asked there. Automated programs like these are not easy, and there's a lot that might break or not work. But if you stick with it you should be able to get something that helps you out and you'll have the skills to expand to other problems and help you solve other tasks. 
Yes it's quite simple. You should do it with the dump though. 1. Make a graph of pages and their links 2. Pick a random page 3. Walk through the graph from step `2` 4. All unreachable pages are those that you haven't marked visited In fact all those nodes marked as visited cannot reach those marked as unvisited.
Nice script! Beautiful and succinct. i have been looking for this for a minute, thank you :)
Yeah. I'd say, OP, if you are too lazy to reimplement it using a dump, at least make your code in its current state not work so that people can't (as easily) download it and scrape Wikipedia (and also put a comment in saying to use a dump). If you're feeling diligent, go ahead and reimplement using the dump. But don't leave it up as is.
I compared autopep8, black, and yapf and found autopep8 to produce the most pleasing code with the least amount of fuss.
I tested on Windows and found a couple of issues. Added fixes in the comments of the PR.
Dang, you're good. 
Now we need to find out which two pages are the farthest apart
Beat me to the punch
Wow this is just wow, so simple, so pythonic. Exactly what I was looking for. THANK YOU!!!
on styling i agree, one thing i like about black is that it guarantees the new formatting produces the same AST as the pre-formatted code. sometimes autopep8 has returned code that wont run 
It's great. Thanks mate
I started my programming career with [Lynda.com](https://Lynda.com) and I have to say I don't regret it. The quality of the content is great and the instructors are mostly great as well.
Python's package management is bad, but so is Node.js' package management, so, if you are OK with the later, the former will, probably be fine too. Essentially, Python has a built-in package called `distutils`. It's a bunch of clutches, duct tape and other nonsense thrown together to make a very primitive packaging and distribution system. It has a lot of flaws in its design, s.a. for example, it doesn't allow you to have multiple versions of the same library installed, while, on the other hand, it allows you to execute arbitrary Python code during package install, which may, potentially wreck havoc in your setup. But, instead of replacing this package, there are several attempts to... drum roll... extend it! The most popular one is `setuputils`. It extends `distutils` by pretending it is `distutils`, which confuses a hell of simpletons developers, who write some stuff in `setup.py` expecting it to do what the documentation of `distutils` said, but it does something only vaguely similar, or does nothing at all etc. Both `setuptools` and `distutils` use `easy_install` code to download dependencies, unless you use something else in `setup.py`. For both of them, the default archived format of your package is EGG, and that's how they will install your packages by default, if used by the end user. However, if you are running them via `pip` (which is what happens when you do `pip install ...`), depending on the alignment of the stars, it may install an EGG as is, or, install a WHEEL, or download a WHEEL, unpack it, create an EGG and install that. There are countless ways in which this process may fail. Even though the process is so fragile, the pains of doing it right and throwing away the old stuff are so big and numerous that every new generation of Python enthusiasts wraps a new layer of duct tape around an already massive structure, mostly made of duct tape. This is how `virtualenv`, and later `venv` were born. Their role is to try to manage Python interpreter and library sets, i.e. to allow you to have several independent environment, where you can have different versions of the same libraries installed (which wouln't have been necessary if `distutils` was functioning correctly). However, neither solves the problem well: they are themselves written in Python, and so present a bootstrapping problem. In particular, you cannot only have Python 2 interpreter, but use `venv` (because it's written in Python 3). Another problem is that virtual environments don't contain Python C headers in them, so, when Python's binary API changes, your environment becomes invalid (because your extensions used system's Python headers to compile against). Finally, the culmination of this absurdity is `pipenv`. As with the previous contenders, it is not a rewrite, but an attempt to put yet another layer of duct tape on an already terrible system. It's a poorly written program with a bunch of bugs of its own. It's drowning in its own bugs related to incompatibility with other Python infrastructure, s.a. `pip` and `virtualenv`, and every attempt at fixing those creates a bunch of new ones. The program grows in size and complexity very quickly. Works terribly slowly and quite unpredictably. On top of compatibility problems, there's the `pipenv` authors poor comprehension of system / infra kinds of problems. So, for example, in order to implement their command line interface, instead of using built-in packages, which handle input correctly, they used a third-party library, which doesn't understand what system locales and codepage settings are for, and does some random nonsense (as a result, you cannot use `pipenv` on systems with locale being set to `LC_ALL=C`, which is quite often a default on Linux). ---- #The bright side If you aren't doing anything complex, i.e. you literally have 3 libraries you rely on, and all of them are well-supported, regularly tested with a bunch of package management tools and live on pypi.org, then going with `distutils`, `setuptools`, `pipenv` or (not mentioned above) `poetry`, `pybuilder` etc. will most likely work.
https://docs.python.org/3.7/c-api/capsule.html Even though I don't know what you mean when you say "passing data structure into Python". The above allows you to pass an opaque pointer, which Python will store and will manage its lifetime (by calling your code when it doesn't use it anymore, for cleanup). But this will not automatically create a Python object that has all the bells and whistles of C++ objects. If you want something like that, use Cython or SWIG to generate that kind of code for you. You could obviously do it by hand, but it's a lot of tedious work with a lot of opportunities to screw yourself over some obscure parts of Python implementation. For a hand-coded version you may use this: https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/blob/master/python/google/protobuf/pyext/message.cc#L2926 as a reference 
Trying to build a script that seeds the DB with millions of orders Easier said than done for me, because it means I have to create the other things that require to build the order. I have a framework to work with so it's not like I have to build it from scratch, but it also means I have to understand how the methods in the framework work and how to get them to work to how I want. I'm also a noob in Python nor have I coded in years so this causes me utter stress in the office. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
Glad that you like it. :)
So... tl:dr is we are screwed if we have too many dependencies? But for my project there is literally 3 libraries in use at the moment, 1 of them is not well-supported (not using a lot of functionalities though, I can probably avoid using it if things go wrong). So I'll be fine at the moment?
look into SWIG. Its a pain to setup but once you get it going its mostly just-works.
Tell that to Eve Online that was built with Stackless Python.
Graphql? 
Cool thanks for the summary. I did read through it a bit though. Really interesting search, makes me wanna try my hand at something similar.
Love black. I've covered most of my team to it using the vscode setting
So you wrote an AI competitor for The Hitler Game?
&gt; I'm into game development, so having a tiny runtime of a language similar to python would be good enough. If you don't mind using a full-fledged game engine you should check out godot (https://godotengine.org/). The engine is written in C/C++ and for game logic it uses its a custom language GDScript which is very close to python syntactically.
The choice is between one global lock and many small locks (otherwise python itself might have race conditions) the former is faster by an order of magnitude. Several people have tried to remove the GIL (e.g. the Giloctimy project) and none have been able to achieve the same speed as CPython.
ratatat? :)
Does this work on a directed graph as well?
I should leave it as an exercise to the reader to convince yourself it's true. Consider what happens when you reach a leaf...
Thanks a lot for sharing your experience/expertise with us! It is quite interesting what you are saying. If we exclude pylint, each tool can provide fast check for a specific category of issues. The question is: do we need to perform all the checks at every change (and maybe it is better to use pylint) or are there no really fixed/suggested rules regarding when to perform such checks?
Just use a lambda and the `key` argument?
Why not? What you dont like about it?
Stop putting your shitty spam in the subject text.
&gt;sorted(l, key=lambda e: 0 if e is None else e) This is a good solution as it also puts None before negative numbers as per Py2.
I should really try harder because the two times I tried I found it morecumbersme than venv+pip.
Could you share your code in github please?
If you use linting to check for errors, it makes sense to at least lint before each commit/push. It would be embarrassing to push changes with misspelled variable names.
 import math l = sorted(l, key=lambda x: x if x is not None else - math.inf)
Thank you, I'll try to take inspiration from your answer. However, there are case where my key function relies on rich comparisons, and I need to test if this will work when `x` is not an `int` or `float`.
In this case you could have a `key` function that returns a tuple to namespace comparisons by type comparable types. e.g. def namespaced_key(item): if item is None: return (0, None) if isinstance(item, (int, float)): return (1, item) ... sorted(l, key=namespaced_key)
I couldn't be bothered to go to the docs; but this seems much more optimal as you're going to lose as whole bunch of function calls (if pretty fast ones).
https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html
I didn't like it. 
Yes. You train the model in Python, save the weights in a format you can parse in Java, then load the weights in Java, forward-propagate the data through them, ..., profit!
vscode, sublime and atom are editors, not IDEs i believe
You should not add external libraries to your Git repo, unless there is a really good reason to do so. In order to do this properly, you can add a file to your repository which lists all required dependencies (libraries). Usually this is called requirements.txt, and can be generated with pip, which you also use to install the packages: pip freeze &gt; requirements.txt. In order to install packages on another device, you can then execute pip install -r requirements.txt. By default you will use tour global pip installation, meaning that a lot of unwanted dependencies will be added to this file. In order to reslove this, you can use a separate environment, as mentioned by other comments.
The lambda tricks will work, but I’d focus on the architecture of the program, why are bones being added into the dataset to begin with, how are these values created, and used? It creates a bad anti-pattern, and requires other programmers to account for it for all instances.
I just want to say kudos for the migration, it's nice to read this instead of the usual "I don't wanna"!

&gt; sometimes autopep8 has returned code that wont run Do tell! I'm trying to get everyone on the autopep8 train, so I'd rather have the map of where the sleeping dragons lie. 
Can you elaborate? I'm not sure what project you are working on. 
Probably not. What are your obejctions? And all of you who downvoted, why? If you hold PEP8 as a religious tenet that must not be questioned, you are not heeding *A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds.*
What are some common use cases for Selenium? What functions do you usually have to write whenever you start a Selenium project? I’m just doing a research type project involving Selenium 🙂
Why does this have down votes? 
Sometimes the data has holes. These holes existing is not an issue, and coercing them into values does not make the program more correct.
This is the bettest/safest version. For the original query, that becomes `key=lambda v: (0, v) if v is None else (1, v)`
Well, the first thing I personally do is call webdriver to chrome and such. Then I use webdriver to load a url. &amp;#x200B; For example: driver = [webdriver.Chrome](https://webdriver.Chrome)('/path/to/chromedriver/') driver.get('r/https://yourwebsite.com') &amp;#x200B;
Use poetry. Very pleasant to work with and it replaces the need to create venvs, pipfile, requirements.txt, setup.py, lets you easily manage dependencies and dev-dependencies, manages versioning.. 
If this was a multi dimensional array, with sparse fields, I’d agree. But there’s many solutions to dealing with nones that don’t require sorting them, like not having them in the list to begin with, and storing none occurrences in a counter.
Holy shit I did not expect to find exactly what I was looking for... what inspired you to make this? Cause I thought I was a genius for a minute.. 
[I made the [HN post](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18182791) that seems to have prompted this question.] &gt; I've read about python and how it's a complex language which is hard to optimize and make faster. What sort of feature, if removed, could make python so much faster? I love python for its syntax, but honestly I don't really care about much else. The top comment by /u/spinwizard69 says "Python focuses on developer performance not code performance" and "Very few languages can do both". While that's true for current languages, I don't think there's any fundamental reason why a language couldn't be both productive and performant. One way for a language to achieve much better performance than Python would be to use static typing. Could a statically-typed language be as productive as Python? [Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org) or [Nim](https://nim-lang.org) may be able to achieve this, but I fear that both are destined to fail in the marketplace as they compete directly with Go (which is becoming very popular, despite its shortcomings as a language, because of its powerful runtime and the backing of Google). On the other hand, V8 and LuaJIT have shown that it is possible for a dynamically-typed language to be much faster than interpreted Python. But, with the success of TypeScript, type hints in Python and similar technologies, would a new dynamic language, no matter how fast, have a chance in the marketplace as the industry seems to be moving away from dynamic typing? &gt; I'm into game development, so having a tiny runtime of a language similar to python would be good enough. Is something similar to lua but with a syntax similar to python? Interpreted Lua is not significantly faster than interpreted Python. However, Lua's simplicity allowed Mike Pall to create LuaJIT, which is *much* faster. It would be possible to design a lightweight Python-like language with a LuaJIT-like runtime, but it would be a *lot* of work - and would anyone use it when Python, Lua[JIT] and JavaScript are all established languages that each provide most of the benefits?
At this moment in time the language with the best possibility of giving us "both" is Apples Swift. It seems to have the right combination of easy to write, a REPL and a avenue to compiled code. However Swift is very new and it remains to be seen how widely it will be adopted or how it will mature into a reliable language. Lua is very interesting as it is embedded in a number of Applications, Python is also. The point here is that the languages end up being exposed to people that are not mainstream developers. Adoption by developers outside the mainstream has been a huge win for Python as it s now used in the engineering and science worlds extensively. I see this non mainstream development as key to getting any replacement for Python to the point Python is now.

lmao this is exactly why you don't use python for games, non-scientific animations, graphics, ect.
This is like the third or fourth time I've tried to complete Automate The Boring Stuff and I keep hitting a wall where the easy stuff is too easy but the hard stuff is too hard and I get stuck. Like everything from Chapter 1-3 I understand, even the practice projects. But right when I get to the chapter 4 practce projects, I have no idea where to even begin. Just kinda sucks cuz I'd really like to learn Python but I think I'm just not smart enough :/

“Python codes”
What if my objects are ORM models, and contain attributes that can sometimes be `None`. If I want to `groupby` on a key attribute that can be `None`, I need to sort them because `groupby` won't accept unsorted iterables. In that case, how would you proceed?
Lot of games these days are written in javascript, that use an engine written in C++. That division of labour is the same as the one spinwizard69 descirbes above. 
Python is great for games if you don’t rely on pure python for number crunching (which is usually what kills a python game), but to flat out say it can’t do it is ignorant.
I'm aware, but that doesn't answer my former question about optimizing python. I hate js. And i doubt that so many industrial level games are written in js anyways. I'm not here for arguing.
What do you mean by misused? Code conventions are a great thing to enforce. I know that I could save my code and run autopep8 on it, rather than fixing the whitespace myself. But more often than not, I do get a warning of errors or very shady practices. 
It's not what I m asking for, but thanks I already know about godot.
It's because they optimized the parts where python is slow.

I’ve just started using [yapf](https://github.com/google/yapf) in VS Code, and am pleased with it, but, if nothing else, I find this argument compelling: &gt; [yapf] is based off of 'clang-format', developed by Daniel Jasper. In essence, the algorithm takes the code and reformats it to the best formatting that conforms to the style guide, even if the original code didn't violate the style guide. The idea is also similar to the 'gofmt' tool for the Go programming language: end all holy wars about formatting - if the whole codebase of a project is simply piped through YAPF whenever modifications are made, the style remains consistent throughout the project and there's no point arguing about style in every code review. 
I do login/logout in every selenium test, also I upload files a lot. I wrapped login and logout in context manager: # 'nav' is a wrapper for WebDriver with additional methods that specific for our UI def test_create_security(nav): with Session(nav, ADMIN_CREDENTIALS): admin.users.create_admin(nav, ...) Also, `Session` in `__exit__` creates screenshot of browser if there was exception and writes that screenshot in Allure report. Between tests I need to perform cleanup, for that I use decorators like @Cleanup(users=True) def test_create_user(nav): ... I would definitely recommend you to create some wrapper around WebDriver with common elements of UI that's been testing. For example, filling forms or clicking dropdown menu: class WebDriverWrapper(): def input_form(self, key, val, clear=False): path = f"//div[./label[contains(text(), '{key}')]]//input" for elem in self.locate(path, multi=True): self.input(elem, val, clear=clear) def click_dropdown(self, name, val): self.click("//button[contains(text(), '%s')]" % name) # click a button to expand menu self.click("//a[contains(text(), '%s')]" % val) # click to select an item in menu
Now write software for video screen capture.

The test system isn't forgiving at all. I can accept that if each lab does provide all the needed information related to the expected output, but that's not always the case. Some of my solutions succeed with the tests given in the doc but not with the tester code and I have no idea why. I wrote Pythonic code, as much as possible. Is there a way to get the code reviewed ? 
Still what's the point of downvoting it
Lmao, never said it couldnt. You just end up with garbage that looks like shit. To think there arent a dozen tools that are 30x better is ignorant.
I don't, but that's pretty funny
Well fuck now I will
My condolences 
&gt; It could ranging from ½ a day to a week or easily a month I second this. I've personally had GUI's that took months to really figure out, and then I've had one where I got the majority of it done in a week or two. There are so many variables to consider, like how familiar is the developer with the language, what library you're using, how long you've been using the library, community support for the library, documentation, etc.
Seems kind of hacky.
I just released my very first Python package. It's called \[fBrowser\]([https://github.com/FastestMolasses/fBrowser](https://github.com/FastestMolasses/fBrowser)). It's supposed to be a selenium helper library. The goal is to allow you to quickly create selenium applications using convenient functions. Some functions include a browser handler, authenticating a web page, creating new tabs, and more. Please check it out and let me know what you think!
Physics, matrix manipulations (e.g, cloth simulation), depending on the scale of the game; damage calculations (in an RTS without unit limits for example). Basically anything where raw math is being done would be faster in a C/C++ extension. As for how; SWIG, Ctypes, Cython (can’t really speak from experience on that one) are all good for highly specialized stuff (but you have to write the C/C++ yourself except for cython, which is a python superset). There is also numpy if you want to stick to “pure” python (I believe it uses CTypes under the hood), and different interpreters like pypy. 
Garbage in garbage out. If you write shitty code you get shitty results. What tools exactly? You have the same OpenGL interface in python that you do in C or C++.

You’re mistaken . I wasn’t calling OP’s code shitty, I was calling yours shitty.
It feels like my brain doesn't have enough RAM for logical problem solving lol 
Caffeine and melodic music 
There's a way, but it's very hard to pull and you need to get a memory dump from the running computer (my guess is you're on Linux, and that's not as easy as if you were on windows). After that you should run volatility against the memory, extract the memory of the process your code is running on (I guess a python instance), and then you'd have to extract the bytecode of your program, and "decompile" it back to source form. Never had to do this crazyness, though a guy at my uni used to do stuff like this as digital forensic challenges, which is why I got a bit of an idea. At this point, you're seriously looking at rewriting the changes from memory as a saner alternative.
What do you mean when you say "the algorithm"? You should be using a NN library/framework in the first place.
You could also add a \_\_float\_\_ magic method to handle "converting" to float on your classes (if that doesn't bring more trouble, of course).
Hi, hope I can help. Your if statements are checking if a is equal to the variables rather than the strings. You need to put quotes around each expected input. Also, as the cheerful bot states, r/learnPython is probably the best place for this type of question. Good luck though, let us know how you get on. 
It has to be true... It has to ve true... It has to be true... ... Okay, I convinced myself
No. You train the model ("the neural network") with python tools, then your write it off to a file in a binary representation (HDF5, for example) and then you load that file from you Java code, using the appropriate method/class in the Java NN framework you picked.
numpy does a *lot* of C stuff under the hood.
Sorry for that. I'm new to neural network and python. Thanks!

Eh, a one time download of ~5.6G of data to make the BFS searches nearly instantaneous even in cases of no match.

Oh ok, I thought so, I was hoping that one of the attorneys (or even a paralegal) that posted to this community would respond. However, thank you for your response, and I'll keep in mind your suggestions. If I can figure out how to get the caption page automated, and maybe even having the format of the pleading paper constructed by Python, it'd be a great asset. Here's a link to the type 28-lined paper if you're curious: &lt;[http://www.vinotique.com/postpic/2015/04/california-legal-pleading-template\_403466.png](http://www.vinotique.com/postpic/2015/04/california-legal-pleading-template_403466.png)\&gt; For example, the formatting of the28-lined paper is specific. The contact information goes to line 1. The title of the court goes to line 8. The title of the case goes at line 11. The footer is required to have that horizontal line over it, and the page number just above the horizontal line. And the nature of the paper (i.e. Notice of Motion and Motion to Dismiss) goes next to the right of the title of the case. Then if you look closely you can see how the double spacing (also required) of the paragraph are aligned with the 28-lined numbers on the left margin, as well as the two vertical lines on the left margin, and the single vertical line on the right margin. Question: What does bioinformatics involve? &amp;#x200B; It's also interesting what you say about DNA being capable of being considered a language. I never thought of it like that.
r/woosh. Im not surprised someone who can't understand the simple statement of "use the best tools for the job" is am idiot 😂
For directed graphs, it's wrong for your quote "all those pages that can't reach each other have different colors". Imagine a simple directed graph with two nodes A and B, and one directed edge A -&gt; B. If your random algorithm chooses A first, they'll both have the same color seeming to indicate that you could start from B and reach A (which you can't); if it choose B first they'll have different colors if you don't recolor B after visiting A (seeming to indicate if you start with A you can't reach B, though you can). That said if you interpret A and B having different colors meaning that either A has no path to B **or** B has no path to A, then it works; and similarly A and B having the same color meaning that A has a path to B **or** B has a path to A.
Gah I wish I had a more precise response / an example to show you, it has been at least a year since I stopped using vim-autopep8. All I can say is vim-autopep8 at times produced invalid python files, though I cant say it wasnt an interference with other commands I was running on save in conjunction with the formatter (isort / remove white space / etc)

Enforcing style would be excessive IMO, but narrowing the linter's configuration to only catch errors and including the linter could catch errors your test cases wouldn't. I can't think of that as anything other than a positive.

Doesn't every project? I mean what's the difference in me using numpy, scipy, VTK, PyQt, which are written in C that I don't have to mess with? I get that Python is slow, but that doesn't mean game development is not possible in Python. Sure, it's a problem in pure python, but almost nobody even uses pure python, so it's a moot point.

Normally I don't let go of a file before flake8 is satisfied. Most of the complaints can be handled by autopep8, so I don't spend that much time futzing with whitespace. We are a mostly C shop, so there are many genuine bugs uncovered by the warnings. For instance, people have a tendency to `from something import *` that is a shitty practice on many levels, not least because sometimes symbols become chained through several such imports. That is so close to a real bug, that I don't see the difference. But of course, if we had greater maturity in writing Python, flake8 might not be as effective a tool to locate programming errors. 
What would I use instead?

it great you are finding some practical uses for python! &amp;#x200B; i have found its great for quick utility scripts, the most notable one i have made is one that downloads a zip file and unpacks some DDL's out of it, then puts them in a folder. &amp;#x200B; and if you wanna improve the script a bit, you could do something like this: from random import randint, randrange def get_rolls(): return randint(1, 6), ('Heads', 'Tails')[randrange(2)] while True: if input('\ndo you want to roll? [y/n]').strip() == 'y': dice, coin = get_rolls() print(f'dice: {dice}, coin: {coin}') else: print('seeya!') 
Not using 'else' is bad practice. Instead of if == 'no' you could use else and achieve the same objective and more.
No, probably not screwed. You get into "we are screwed" when you have a couple dozens of your own libraries that you want to use internally in your company, not sharing them with the world, or upwards from that.

I like this comment, as It gives an actual, critical responce to the OP, unlike all the others which feel the need to point out that they don't agree with him because of his politics.

That is no python.
I'm already planning to use tinycc as a scripting language instead of python. Python is too big and large for a game, at least to my taste. I'd rather use scripting that runs every frame, rather than punctually or once every 2 seconds. I would choose python on a server, but not on the client. Look, don't try to act all offended because I don't want to use CPython in a game. My question was just about having python syntax in a language that is fast enough with a low memory footprint, and what is making python slow, which I could get rid off.
Yeah, I used to have a jenkins job configured to check code with some of these tools + test coverage. It doesn't even mean you need to be 100% correct because often you enter a project in the middle of this life. A jenkins job can check if the number of bad practices in code don't grow. If you want to monitor your pylint violations you can also use sonar interface. 
It's not python! 
What is your question?
Hi, The question is: how do I get the code to work? Cheers, Jean-Christophe
Found the cause and solution here: https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/5520#issuecomment-426371485 I still need to invoke it as `mypy --strict .` instead of `mypy --strict file.py` though.
Still not worth it.
&gt; Double asterisks in dictionary literals How did I merge dict before the `{ **dict1, **dict2 }` syntax I would never know.
Why bother even asking? If they started the program they obviously need to flip coins. Just ask how many times you need to flip a coin and roll a die and output and array no need to ask redundant questions.
The ever elusive Python 2.8
What's wrong with anaconda?
Well, the error is quite self explanatory. Go to google console and check out whats up with your API key, and see if it's limited?

I like to make the randint import smaller with from random import randint as ri x = ri(0,6)
It don't want none unless you got buns hun.
Ok this is much more helpful, I can almost help flesh out a useful program. First, is the example paper you linked your desired input or output? Assuming the pdfs are not scans and you can copy and paste text, you'll want to use a pdf reader. From automate the boring stuff, [here is a section which should help a little](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/chapter13/). I recommend taking the pdf and saving the text as a text file so you can begin to see how the reader grabs text, and you can start looking for patterns. Eventually you'll need to write a parse that goes through the newly created text file and looks for your target information and grabs it. After that, it'll need to reorganize the data into a format for the new pdf. I'm not sure what template you're use to using, but I recommend using LaTeX to generate the page, [here is one template](https://github.com/gkochans/Legal_Brief_Using_LaTeX) and a google search for court pleading latex template yields many other results. I recommend latex because it's easy to write a python program that generates the .tex file, then make the program compile the .tex file into a pdf. The toughest part is going to be the parser. It's just going to take a lot of staring at the source pdf, the new .txt file, and then your parsers grabbed sections. I write a lot of parsers and that's really the secret. Stare at it a long time, make a few changes, look at the results, then hand it a new file and see if it still works. Iterate until you have an acceptable solution. 
I know of the software... But my system is low grade. 32 bit, 2gb ram. The video will lag.

How it felt back in the day when trying to install Pandas/Numpy/SciPy on a Windows machine.
In your opinion, why there is the tendency to produce static analysis tools that wrap other tools?
No. Without the parenthesis means it is printing what is stored in the variable ‘roll’, which is a random number 1 through 6
I see. Thank you!
That's anaconda. Try miniconda.
{k:v for k,v in itertools.chain(dict1.items(), dict2.items())}
Suggestion for script refactor: `import random` `print(random.randint(0, 1)`
In this case it will execute both if statements every single time This could result in performance issues if the logic being tested is intensive Even if it is not intensive it still just wastes processing time for literally no reason ____ It offers no increase in readability. You can understand the code exactly the same with either layout. If you really want to use another if, use `elif` at least.
Good to know, thanks for the insight!
Brilliant -- thank you!
those were just some oversights when i made it, thanks for pointing them out
r/learnpython https://python.swaroopch.com/ http://interactivepython.org/courselib/static/thinkcspy/index.html Countless YouTube tutorials Best way for me was, and is, learning by doing
I agree but I also think its not a major deal unless you're being very processor heavy. If you do want to speed up your code/make more efficient perhaps, else is a good a good statement to know.
`randint` is not too long to type, i just leave it as-is

That's why you always put the bay covers back in after taking out a cdrom drive
I agree, i started with what worked.
`dict1.update(dict2)`
I doubt if you can make your code smell, but it won't take many to make it stink. Seriously - can those parameters be packaged as a data structure, an object, passed with one word? 
haha yeah, asking questions is a bit of a skill, and a bit of an art. And you're correct, the algorithm is basically the exact same, you just swap out the final pdf step with a MS Word instead, so you'd use something like [this for the template](https://templates.office.com/en-us/Legal-pleading-paper-28-lines-TM03992040), and [this to populate it](http://pbpython.com/python-word-template.html)

I need to use selenium to log into google chrome and then run its automated process.... does this support this and or is this possible
The migration from 2 to 3 will do that to you
Man, Linux is free and would probably run better on your low spec machine. Also a windows 10 Pro key is 8 euros on eBay. If you list your specs I could recommend you a Linux distribution but Windows 8 sucks you'd be better off on 7
I think cobra kai swept your knee. 
I do have authentication code that will automatically login. However I do know that Google has their email and password inputs in separate screens. I’m going to be releasing an update soon that will support this, as I understand a lot of other sites do this too. 😀
I liked the metro look and the dashboard alternative view as an alternative to the desktop. It was fun putting widgets for all my favorite things on the landing screen. Not really sure why people hated it so much except that it was different

Not because it was different but because it didn't make sense. On a big non touch screen, tiles were horrible. Big, unevenly spaced, with only few colours and advertising thrown in for good measure. Search function was horrible too. Don't get me wrong I love full screen dashboards and use the KDE environment one daily but that windows one was everything a dashboard shouldn't be. Completely unorganized, unresponsive clutter. Add to the fact that users were force fed this tablet esque landing page with no alternative and you are essentially entering a user experience nightmare. That is why I hated it. Not sure about other people.

Yes I have a gpu. Not huge (GeForce GTX 750 Ti) but enough for me to play around with. Thanks for this. Maybe it's time to drop anaconda. It's good because most of this gets automatically installed, but bad for the same reason - any change to what you're given upsets all the rest.
Man that case is very strange. Or am I just very young and that was standard when i was little.
Cracking me up over here
I mean the original question was "Are you able to find Two Wikipedia pages that does not have a connection?". In that context I would say "connection" is poorly defined. In my answer I interpreted "connection" as being that you can go from A to B or B to A.
Is that not a ball python? It looks like a ball python to me.
drop it off at geek squad.
&gt; Also a windows 10 Pro key is 8 euros on eBay. That sounds rather sketchy. Is it not?
That's right, it was a cob-rt mission.

I don't even see a tail **¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯** Who knows though. The shape of the head reminds me of my old ball python, but I am hardly a expert on snakes.
Thanks for this article. As a noob,I can tell you this definitely helped. One suggestion - this def add(a, b): print(a + b) b = add(1, 2) Can be confusing when you're just learning and try to make the connection/distinction with the variable assignment 'b', and the second parameter 'b' in the add function.
The tip should have been "if you have an import scoped within a function, then rewrite your code and put the import outside". This is my general problem with `patch` as well. In 90% of the cases the code ought to be rewritten so that patching isn't needed. 
I don't have first-hand experience doing this so perhaps there's a preferred method, but my first gut instinct would be to communicate over a socket, rather than interface between languages
*Cobra
You don't have to use IDLE. It's just what they suggested you use because it's simple. It's very limited though. Try WingIDE or PyCharm. They're both free for students.
Without an example, you're not really making your point. I certainly don't follow the rules 100% of the time, but in general it does make cleaner code. I'll take somethong easy. Ideally line length is less than 80 characters is a good thing. Why would you really care if someone's code used 81 characters? You're not following the spirit of the recommendation if that's the case. What about 100 characters? What about 120 or 36000? 100 is a lot to me and the where I try to cap things, but still whatever. I also hit 36000 on very, very rare occasion. It's just a list of numbers, so whatever. Code logic is one thing. A string that's supposed to be 120 characters representing a single line that's indented 20 spaces maybe gets a pass. So why is your line so long? Is it because you shouldn't make 1000 lined functions with highly indented, hard to follow behavior? That's usually the reason. Not running though is stupid.
Had that same HP tower for years.
My open source library is super niche and gets 1-5 downloads per day. That's terrible. It's damn good though. What I care about most is the foundational libraries like numpy, scipy, pyqt, and vtk vs a niche 3rd party library and secondly that your niche code uses them well. Ever tried coding an eigenvalue solution or a sparse matrix solve routine? It's a pain. Wait...why am I reading C++ docs for pyqt and vtk? It works...
Looks like a shitty Dell case. They made a lot of stupid cases over the years, but you'd pretty much never see this kind of thing in a case you buy yourself.
I interop with C# somewhat frequently, and I usually just use xmlrpc.
Yes, and `.update` returns nothing, which is very annoying in the "functional programming" bits of the code.
It's doable. You could have a flask app or even just serve a static page with simple http where the JavaScript on the web page polls your python script for updates and then updates your page content.
You could have some javascript to do an ajax call every second, that lets you keep control of the page appearance while the request is in progress. You could use a page with the meta refresh header; that will reload the entire page every second.
Yep...
[This](https://youtu.be/rfscVS0vtbw) is what got me started.
You might need to just Bash this one.
You should make a new virtual environment (something like conda create --name coolproject) and then install those scipy, numpy, tf, etc on the this coolproject environment. &amp;#x200B; Usually you don't want to pip3 install in your python root/base environment
Oh, a real python! IMHO, you can sue https://realpython.com/ guys.
The dark theme IDE is key.

Worse for me was I didn't know my PyCharm had been set up to be using Vim. I randomly installed whatever plug in was shown in the installer. Even though I am from a Unix background, I had to wreck my brain around why was the laptop making weird noises when I was typing. It wasn't even typing. Then I randomly pressed random keys out of frustration that I suck in learning Python even. That's when I figured out what the problem was. 
Man, it's Cobra.

I get the joke but technically an anaconda is a python
Naw that is a project
I agree, this is a boa 
Code and usage instructions here: https://github.com/nikhilkumarsingh/prettype
This wouldn’t happen if you had proper cooling.
Actually thinking of it more, my interpretation was wrong too. Two nodes having the same color just mean they can both be reached from some common ancestor and does not mean there is a path between them. E.g., imagine a directed tree with a root note R and two child nodes C1, C2 (only edges are R -&gt; C1 ; R -&gt; C2). If your random algorithm selects R first with first color, all nodes get same color (because R can reach C1 and C2). However, there is no path from C1 to C2. Probably best to do something like [Kosaraju](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosaraju%27s_algorithm) or [Tarjan's strongly connected components of directed graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarjan%27s_strongly_connected_components_algorithm). If two nodes belong to different components, then we know at least one way it will not work (and DFS can quickly show which way, if not both).
It's Cobra bro. Stay away from it. It would have been nice had it been python.
Nah, you can use whatever. I "have" to use eclipse for school and use VSCode instead. Far superior editor with a better dark theme.
I think we could consider antivenin a dependency in this case
Maybe you have a big inside. I believe python is being used to search for that bug
Im not fully agree with naming. I think, that writing *knn* instead of *k_nearest_neighbors* is better. If you write code in a concrete domain, use domain's acronyms. It just easier to read the code. Everyone in data science domain knows what does knn mean. You write code for yourself and your colleagues. If you a data scientist, web developer don't have to understand your code. Moreover, even if you write "k_nearest_neighbors* it says nothing to person, who doesn't know what does this algorithm do. 
Wow, this guy is still active! Bought his book in beta and never got the promised update. Gave up after emailing him multiple times!
I second VS Code. Lightweight free editor with debugging functionality and quite a rich extension library.
Cobra extensions is currently unstable and possibly lethal when opening containers. 
It’s hp. 
 Why can Filter Function be used for Boolean and List? How dose it work? And the output I have seen is '\[2\]'? Why is it so? When I got the output, I am really confused.
It's a cobra
As someone who has to code review data science code single everyday, I disagree, I would rather it be explicit and named k_nearest_neighbour. If cnn or another acronym with _nn is used it can get really confusing to understand the reference and often in data science projects theres an abundance of abbreviations and acronyms that are slightly different.

Boooo
Thank you! I will move to learnpython. So i'm assuming the ajax call will be supposed to poll my Python scrypt? How can i do it? &amp;#x200B;
Hello, thanks! What it's not clear to me yet, is how can i make JavaScript poll my Python script, through an api for example? &amp;#x200B;
Look into rest APIs. You can expose a rest API on your flask app, and then use JavaScript to send get requests to it.
Don't bind lambdas to names and reuse them within other lambdas. There are *functions* for this purpose in python! 
gRPC/ProtoBufs might also be worth looking into.
I've done my fair share of Python, but how would a loop be better in this scenario? Wouldn't the script be longer?
I prefer starting with just any text editor and the terminal shell, so that you won't get distracted by the fancy features, until you learn enough to know exactly what IDE best suits your need (or none). Also nice to play around with bash commands and git from the very beginning.
I think the correct syntax is 'dun dun dun'

@siddhi do you think is possible every time to rewrite your code to put an import outside a function scope ? Do you have some article that spoke about it ?

oh man... exiting vim is bad enough when you know you're in vim. i can't imagine the frustration of not realizing you're in vim on second thought maybe i can. my keyboard has a function lock that makes the F- keys perform alternate functions without having to hold the fn key. additionally, a few keys on the right side become a numpad. there were a few times early on when i hit the key by mistake that made me think i was going insane or my os was broken
As u/Bolitho said don't ever bind names to lambdas and also don't use names like `x`, `y` and `z` because you always inevitably end not having an idea what is going on as you just did. &gt; Why can Filter Function be used for Boolean and List? How dose it work? The filter function tests a predicate over all elements of some lists and returns only the elements which pass the predicate. The predicate is a function which returns a boolean, it is not a boolean by itself. For example: `filter(lambda x: x &gt; 3, [-1, 5, 2, 7])` = `[5, 7]` &gt; And the output I have seen is '[2]'? Why is it so? When I got the output, I am really confused. Because the algorithm you coded gives that as a result? What did you expect?
Take a look at the [requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/) library.
I mean I don't know the reason why the output is '\[2\]'. Can you help me explain it? I am getting stuck in this result. &amp;#x200B;
Ive been using this for AGES! Its good to see it get some love again. Thankyou for updating. &amp;#x200B; Anything important changed since the last version??
Congrats on your first package. Did notice that you shoved everything in __init__.py , a lot of people hate that and would give you quite a bit of grief for it. You should add your dist and egg folders to your .gitignore. You should also consider writing some tests. Tests are a prerequisite for most people who would want to use your package. Something as simple as this don't really need it, but you should make it a habit. By the way, love that you used type hints. Highly suggest you also type hint your returns. Even if higher up in the stack doesn't have type hints, they may one day and then you're already get the benefits. Type hints can just point to a class such as: class SpecialObject(object): def __init__(self, x: int, y: str): self.x = x self.y = y def some_function(x: int, y:str) -&gt; SpecialObject: z = SpecialObject(x, y) return z Now I've type hinted the SpecialObject but if it weren't, then you'd get some benefit but not throughout the stack. Since it is type hinted I get it throughout the stack. Even so, un-hinted, it still allows for a lot of code introspection.
Who the hell says "boo lee in"? 
You can also hit run in the top menus (I can't check which one cause I'm on mobile) and then select your version of Python (basically, I don't 100% know what it is) and then hit the little play button and it should run and should output in the terminal at the bottom of the editor. That might make no sense so apologies in advance
Nice. Button colors are um, weird tho
I'd possibly recommend starting with an Anaconda installation and using the Spyder IDE it comes with. It's simple and comes with many common and useful packages.
&gt; Get started by just using any text editor. I'd rather say use a text editor that is smart enough to understand that a .py file is a Python source code file and has sane defaults like using spaces over tabs and using four of them for pep8 compliance.
So use assembler or machine code.
IT'S COBRAAAAA! Better call GI Joe.
Waooo great playlist shared. Thanks a lot. 
I also experimented with Anaconda but nothing came of that.

It would raise an IncorrectQueenLyricsError, which is a subclass if IncorrectLyricsError, but it deletes all your files, tells you to get your shit together, then BSODs your machine.
Well that's terrifying, I'm guessing that's India.
True but technically it's a Cobra.
That's actually amazing. Plus his 403 error is just a page saying "hi". lol
It’s like chinese 
What's your end goal? Do you just want to be notified when a webpage changes? 
r/Lear python is more likely to help you.
Clone the repo and execute the command as documented in the repo. You should execute the command from the root directory of the project using a terminal window 
If you know nothing about Python I would suggest you go away and learn the basics before you dive into using libraries. 
Why is it called prettype and not prettypi ? 
Yes, 10 or 20 webpage changes
Then why not use some sort of a cloud service to do that? Many of them offer free plans. 
Good!

What do you mean by can’t? And you **check** check every value individually by iterating over a list..
Sssss Sssss Sss
I mean I have to find another way of checking through an entire list, without using for loops or the all / any functions
im not sure of how to interate through an entire list within a while statement
Checking through an entire list **is** iteration. You *can* do this in a while loop, but it’s not good practice to do so and gives the same result as using a for loop because - as a mentioned above - the only way to check every item in a list is iteration. I suggest you head over to r/learnpython and learn the basics of the language..

But why the mutable response variable? In most cases, and especially in the case of an http API, the best mental model is usually that of a pure-ish function that takes parameters and returns a response. Why have you opted to instead offer a mutable response variable as an input parameters, where the user will then often fall into the trap of passing the response around like nobody's business? I realise this must be a somewhat popular pattern, because it's all over the place, particularly in a lot of NodeJS APIs, but I still struggle to see the appeal compared to the more traditional way of just returning data.

P.S. I apologize for the mistake: corrected the word "symbol" in code
You mentioned install restrictions - are those only on the ubuntu machine or can you install things on your mac? &amp;#x200B; If the later, then just install python 2.7, create a virtualenv for your Qt app, and then use PySide 1. &amp;#x200B; Honestly though, you should just use this as a learning project and create a port of your app that works with python 3.7 and PySide 2. Python 2.7 is EOL in just over a year, there's little reason to use it for someone who is just learning.
I just noticed your reply and wanted to thank you for this! I remember the old days. For several years, I built internal analytics web pages using a corporate CSS description and pymssql. It was pretty goddamn performant, all things considered. 
Mind sharing?
You can make iPython function complete by hitting tab while typing. At least when you're in a Django shell. I haven't used iPython just by itself.

I used to write websites with c++! First language I learnt. I kid you not, I miss the performance... I'm planning on getting into Rust soon. My issue is that the ecosystem isn't very mature yet. Also I don't think the IDE's are quite there yet either. If it's not an enjoyable programming experience then I just don't do it. Rust's performance is just damn insane and the language promises many of the things I dream of, except legibility... 
This kills the computer 
Now make it into a for loop and add a your own guitar solo
I guess what I'm asking is these one line codes aren't generally considered readable even for people who know what they're doing?
List comprehensions are fine for readability as long as the operations are somewhat simple, like a map or filter. Also far more readable than python's map() or filter() functions. 
This is true for the base IPython shell as well

By the way, PyYAML has a `safe_load` function (and associated `SafeLoader` class) that can be used to disable the arbitrary code execution. Though I have not personally audited it since I haven’t used it in a public interface before.
Links from sinxloud.com have an invalid certificate. So this one plus [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/9njhuk/importing_data_python_for_data_science_cheat_sheet/). Looking at your post history, there's quite a few.
I don't see any invalid certificate ... Yes there is post history. Go and check the link you posted. It redirects to the importing data cheat sheet.. 
In your view what's the clearest benefit/biggest differences of this over established micro-frameworks like flask?
I know. I always disliked that. At the minimum safe_load should have been load and load should have become dangerous_load. It's not in the slightest bit obvious that that should be the default, hence people just use load without thinking about the consequences: https://github.com/kennethreitz/responder/blob/9b0cae37947a186a09bebc008de429d390b91725/responder/formats.py This was one in a series of issues that led me to write strictyaml.
I should know that 🤪. Ok, perfection! Thanks again!

It's not a party until there's a `while True:` involved.
Not gonna lie, this looks like a great addition to the standard list of microframeworks. I don't know where I'll be able to use this personally, but it's a great start.
I don't know of any specific Quart extensions for this, but Flask-Login works.

iPython can do a few things if you have the right packages. I think the ones you most need are Jedi and Readline. Readline is the really important one.

Good old Vim for me! :)
It’s pretty simple if you have pip and know how to use it. `pip install -r requirements.txt` installs from a requirements file. `pip freeze &gt; requirements.txt` makes a requirements file. Other than using virtualenv as a best practice to keep your requirements from getting cluttered and having version conflicts, that’s all you need to know. Happy coding!

My bad, I had the impression you were talking about YAML as a format.
API design, usability. Less looking at the docs.
Neat interesting little program. However, I would prefer that you change the italics selection from '&lt;1&gt;' to a regular integer. Just change: curve = str(input("Italic? (none, \'&lt;1&gt;\' or \'&lt;2&gt;\') \n&gt;&gt;&gt; ")) to something like: curve = input("Italic? (0: None, 1: Left Slant or 2: Right Slant \n&gt;&gt;&gt; ")) I love your logic for creating italics (and indeed I learnt something.) Plus, I love how you allowed the user to enter their own character of choice! I would like to "fork" and re-write your program in C. Would be a cool mental exercise for me!

And why please ? Eclipse bashing from intelliJ afficionados is boring. You probably have arguments.
Python isn't slow because it's interpreted, it's slow because every operation is a dozen hashmap lookups and function calls under the covers. Lua is fast and interpreted, for example. If you want a fast language that allows for rapid development, I recommend Go--I use it to prototype solutions before converting them to Python to be integrated into our Python code base. For most things it's about two orders of magnitude faster than CPython. You could also check out Pypy which is a Python interpreter that's about 1 order of magnitude faster than CPython.
Yes, great idea! The previous option of entering the settings was much worse, but I didn’t even think about optimizing italics... I added your solution to the code. Thanks! So maybe I will also do a C program. If there are no other projects.
There is a -table command in pdftotext. How is that one different?
This isn't true. Python isn't slow because it's interpreted; lots of interpreted languages are fast (Lua, JavaScript, etc). Python is slow because it's so dynamic. Every little thing is a dozen hashmap lookups and function calls under the covers. If you were looking to make Python fast, make it more rigid. An alternative is to invest more into a JIT compiler (like Pypy or any modern JS engine) since JITs tend to do a good job at optimizing dynamism.
Nothing beats https://tabula.technology/ it requires Java though

I can't seem to get it installed, does it not support 3.7? I get "Command "python setup.py egg_info" failed with error code 1" when running pip install fBrowser on Windows 10 with only 3.7 installed and within a venv.

&gt; Lots of applications aren't amenable to calling into numpy, etc. I worked on a team that insisted on using Numpy and they actually made performance worse because they needed to invoke a Python function on every value in the array and calling back and forth between Python and C so much ended up costing more than the savings from using Numpy. Sounds like they were not vectorizing their code. You have to write your numpy code in a specific way to get a 500-1000x speedup. Otherwise, it can be a 5x reduction in speed. It really is worth learning how to do it right.
Does that work on mac 
Don't return `True` if you're just doing I/O. If it goes well, it returns `None`. If it goes badly, it's probably good to raise an exception instead of returning `False`.
I'd recommend using the python console as well
It is a shame FREEBSD will sue you.
That's pretty much what it boils down to. Choose a limit. If you don't want to choose a limit, "handle" it by estimating the time needed to complete computation, and pop up a warning if the time is more than one minute. ("Calculating a dice with 100000 sides will take 134 minutes. Are you sure you want to continue?") Other than that, there really aren't any options. I either you only accept a subset of numbers, or you accept all. The only nuance there is is that you could determine the limit dynamically by precomputing the maximum number of sides the program could solve within one minute and using that as the limit, rather than choosing a hard one. But really: Just choose a limit. Take 999 or something.
Seems useful, will test it!
input scrubbing is a common necessity. a simple if/else statement that outputs a meaningful error message if the number is too high should be sufficient. enclosing it in a loop would ensure the script does not close immediately upon a typo causing user frustration. writing two separate functions with the if statement enclosing the function call can also provide a hurdle between input and calculation. for the size of code both solutions are reasonably equal in effectiveness. &amp;#x200B; in the future r/learnpython or r/learnprogramming would be a great place for this question. Good luck on your classes!

I made this demo pip-installable and have tested on both Windows and on Linux. I was surprised when the pip install worked on Linux. It downloads all the artwork you need and sample pgn files too.

The code that drives the interactive part is from 129 to 160. &amp;#x200B; All in all it's quite compact code. Enjoy! Feedback is always welcomed.

Cored Schaefer on youtube. His videos teach you literally everything about python while making it very easy to understand. 
tldr; don't use classes...nope.
Not likely; the array values were largely pointers to Python objects, and the majority of the time was spent calling between C and Python.
You could use a container or a VM
&gt; the majority of the time was spent calling between C and Python. That means you didn't vectorize your code. Doing this is slow... c = np.zeros(a.shape) for i, ai, bi in zip(count(), a, b): c[i, :] = np.cross(ai, bi) this is not... c = np.cross(a, b, axis=1) A well vectorized code means you don't use for loops or if statements.
Agreed on this whole subthread. Mainly there's little value in condensing code in Python. For most purposes any performance gains are so slight they won't matter much, and usually aren't worth the trade-off in readability.

Hah, I see what you mean now, but that's not what "vectorization" means; however, programming in the style you describe allows Numpy to use vectorization optimizations. Unfortunately, it's often impossible or infeasible, for example, calling into domain specific logic on each cell (or even when your array is an array of object pointers).
I've heard this a lot, but how do other languages get away with this (for example, Java or Go)?
But this is Python, even if it isn't easy one way, it is easy another way. Download from github and from the folder you downloaded try: python setup.py install Or pip install -e . I have not tested it, so no 100 % success, but this way worked for me at least once. Good luck. 
That's what numpy and matlab call it. I'm an engineer that codes, so details like what vectorization is isn't a thing I'm clear on. I'm also not up on the differences if any from more standard vectorization if any. The first goal is to get into C and avoid C-python function calls aa much as possible. Numpy does a lot of optimizations and makes use of BLAS well. Furthermore, there an optimized Intel MKL library that makes numpy even faster. I'm not clear on the case that you're referring to that makes numpy slow, but it sounds like there is a better way to do it that does take advantage of numpy properly. I'd need to see the case. Properly written numpy is faster than pure python when your array size passes about 10 elements. I use 100k for a small case.
Considering the link you posted here doesn’t work for me either, I’ll assume he means the entire thing is gone...
Is that the definition of idempotence? I thought idempotence was when a function can be applied multiple times but not change the result beyond the first application, i.e. sorting or the absolute value operation.
I used [Jpype](https://github.com/jpype-project/jpype) for a project and it worked well. It is worth checking out at least.

There is probably a way better way to do this but you can also do this like so. &gt;&gt;&gt; a = -9846.8000000000 &gt;&gt;&gt; b = 3938.0500000000 &gt;&gt;&gt; a-b -13784.849999999999 &gt;&gt;&gt; format(a-b,'.10f') '-13784.8500000000' See https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/floatingpoint.html for an in depth read on why.

Honestly classes are unnecessary in 80% of use cases. I've been mentoring people at work on the use of classes (they are novice programmers and scared of using Python classes for some reason). I reassure them that it pretty much comes down to 2 or 3 use cases, and those are: state machines, multiple inheritance, and monkeypatching/operator overloading. All the other use cases for classes are situational or "preference". Most people who learned a different language before Python (looking at those Java/.NET people) think classes are required to namespace or encapsulate. They don't realize python functions are first class objects and .py files are their own namespaces so native closures and dicts satisfy the majority of abstraction requirements (and are slightly more optimized for this purpose since they don't need to carry around bits of state that are unnecessary). A side benefit of using this pattern is that it also makes teaching the concept of decorators easier (not to mention, intra-class decorators are leaky as hell and on top of that, in native CPython, functions are pickleable whereas classes are not; the complete opposite of Java). Furthermore, since nothing is truly private in a Python class, it's not like classes can enforce purity/immutability without advanced tricks either.
That creates a new list seven times as long every iteration of that (infinite) loop. You're going to run out of memory real fast.
But does this actually kill the computer? Lol, like will it not work anymore? Haha I’m slow right now. 
I think he means deterministic, of which idempotence is subtype of. [Of note](https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/4ibvqd/what_is_the_relationshipdifference_between/)
Thanks a lot! That solved it! 
If PDF is evil, what is the best format to store printable data, like page setup, texts, images, vector graphics and tables? I can export my `*.docx` or `*.pptx` to PDF, but extracting even texts from PDF is messed up.
Stop using PDF. Also, Microsoft Office Python packages are shit.
It shouldn't cause any permanent damage, but it'll make the computer unresponsive very quickly.
Neat, thanks for sharing! :) are you familiar with fast.ai library at all? If you are then is this kinda similar? Could you compare them a little?
For future, regex101.com and similar sites are very helpful.
just import Decimal and the operators should work "normally" most of the time.
[pdfminer.six](https://github.com/pdfminer/pdfminer.six) is my goto for tabular data from PDFs since it detects bounding boxes.
Yeah absolutely. I use it and it's great. But this is meant to be different in some ways. This is meant to work in total sync with Pytorch, Numpy. There are many things which Pytorch doesn't offer for some reason, there are many examples of that on forums, it would all be added to it simultaneously. For instance, keras provides cross entropy loss with support for one hot encoded tensors but pytorch doesn't, you are required to manually manipulate yout Tensor for that. I've added support for that and many others to bring convenience. Fastai has kinda become independent where in let's say you create a learner object, then you are required to use its modules to be able to proceed forward, i don't intent to create such dependencies. Tensorop would return objects which would always be readily available to run with Pytorch or Numpy for that matter for ease of use. It all depends on what you wanna use afterall. I may add integration support for fastai if development goes well giving more flexibility to users. 
I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit: - [/r/askprogramming] [Best way to create APIs when i dont have the source code ?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskProgramming/comments/9nroho/best_way_to_create_apis_when_i_dont_have_the/) &amp;nbsp;*^(If you follow any of the above links, please respect the rules of reddit and don't vote in the other threads.) ^\([Info](/r/TotesMessenger) ^/ ^[Contact](/message/compose?to=/r/TotesMessenger))*
next time try r/domyhomework
That sounds like it would be massively in violation of the terms of service. By definition an API is something *they* would provide. What you're trying to do is create a proxy, by scraping their regular interface?
Unnecessary and convenient are very different. I get a nice print method. My IDE recognizes it. I don't need to import all the things related to it that will probably get moved, but not changed at some point. I can introspect the object and see obvious functions and attributes that are laid out in a logical way. Also, you can totally pickle classes. Just delete the file objects and dictionary references to functions. You have a bug in your code if you cannot pickle your class. I also couldn't care less about non private data members. We're all adults.
Well tbh, I was thinking the same. Probably I'm treading on grey area here. But then again, all I am trying to do is automate certain payments that I make every month . For example- House rent , Electricity bill etc. How is it any different from normal web scraping ? Also, I don't think I'll use the script for more than once a month so I guess I won't be abusing their servers.
I thought you were trying to make it available for third parties, which would be really dodgy. If you want to make automatic payments, you can just give them authority to hit your credit card every month, or your bank account. This seems like way too much work when the entire banking system exists to help with this kind of thing.
To answer your first question, yes, you should learn *how* to write like that. Expanding your collection of tools is one of the critical steps to mastering any craft. Knowing ***how*** to condense your code doesn't mean you must always write like that, but not knowing how completely removes your ability to write compactly, and severely cripples your ability to understand when someone does. Time and experience will help but you should be making the effort to master Python regularly. Bottom line, the ability to write very terse code is mainly rooted in really understanding how the language works. Even if you never once put one of those clever lines of code into production, there will never a time where you'll be upset you learned your craft well. 
No, I'll be using it for my personal use. Reasons why I'm even doing this in the first place : 1. I don't have credit card . And my debit card doesn't allow automatic payments. It requires OTP everytime a payment has to be made. So currently I am thinking of using the in app prepaid wallet to make payments . 2. I have never made a command line tool. Having contributed to few open source cli projects on GitHub, I am very interested to create one of my own. 3. I am trying to improve my python skills and discover more libraries as I learn. This project would be the perfect opportunity to learn something new.
Personally, I believe it’s a combination of many things: natural talent, a lot of study and conscious practice, the environment (being the the right industry or moment of life), and a sprinkle of luck. Admire those brilliant people, but don’t berate yourself. You might be equally talented, but lacking the opportunity. 
Am I the only person that uses a pattern something like this? DEBUG=True def debug(*args, **kwargs): if DEBUG: print(*args, **kwargs) Then you can fill your program with debug() statements, toggling DEBUG global on or off as needed, where needed? I mean, it violates his notion of purity, but I just find it so useful. Additionally, the whole idempotent thing (he uses the term wrong, but let's use his definition in this context): there are so many cases where it is useful to not adhere to this. Sure, it is harder to test, but you can do neat shit. Like anything with state tracking. Even something as simple as random.random() which maintains an internal state violates this. Sure, you can test by seeding it with something specific. But as soon as you're doing anything that isn't math, functions that return different results for the same parameters become super common.
danger, Will Robinson!
I tried that, but my finger got stuck. HALP!
Well that's all very logical, and it's a perfectly valid project as far as command line tools go but you're running the risk of having your account suspended for suspicious activity. I wouldn't mess with financial institutions if it were me.
Damn. But I'm so tempted to proceed. This is gonna be actually useful if I can pull it off.

It really depends upon the specialization. Numpy and the math stuff obviously requires a very specialized education in mathematics and algorithms ... which takes both a certain type of intelligence and a lot of hard work to master. For just general libraries though what really separates the best stuff out there from absolute horrendous crap is simple organizational skills. A library that is easy for end users to use ... small ... lightweight ... and fast ... is generally that way not because of some magical algorithm that some ultra-genius created ... but simple organizational skills. I guess you need some general intelligence to be able to think abstractly, plan, and organize a project ... come up with a design that you can execute ... but to me the sort of organizational skills I'm talking about are things most people possess and are capable of but fail to really execute on. A lot of times it seems like people obsess and over-architect things ... or they do the opposite and just focus on each little problem obsessively without taking the time to think about how everything will work together .. and instead of an easy to understand unifying design you end up with a mess of spaghetti code that works by sheer luck and the force of nature that most coders end up being. Most developers seem to be fairly well organized in their lives, but when it comes to code they just get overly excited or something and things turn out in a much messier way. When it comes to larger projects with more and more complexity ... all of these organizational skills become that much more important. It doesn't really matter if you are a genius with algorithms if you can't organize it into something functional ... especially when you're working with a project that has 20 developers and a bazillion lines of code ... organization is *key*.
Yes I meant or. At least one of them. Bad phrasing on my part. 
I would like to know as well, but I would think they actually have high level of passion that allows them to persist and stick through in learning? Also I would assume they use the language so much that they can contribute some complex stuff 
There's a [nice documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/floatingpoint.html) explaining why this happens. It all comes down to the fact that the only floating point numbers understandable for the computer are finite sums of integer powers of two.
If you have to ask for clarification on this then yes :)
Didnt see that massive roast coming. 
They might be more talented but education, experience, work situation/role and a motivation and opportunity to push on are more important. 
Are they really? Like, I honestly don't think people who contribute to open source are somehow automatically "smarter" than "average programmers". Are they more experienced with the specific thing they're working on? Sure, they are, but that doesn't make such experience impossible to acquire for the "average programmer". In fact, those projects are usually understaffed, so they are very much interested in bringing in more "average programmers" to help out - this means they'll often have a process for onboarding and mentoring contributors, or at least "good first issues" for you to get your feet wet. Those would be a good place to get started :)
I work on my 140k lined open source code as a hobby. I do it right and don't really take shortcuts. If it takes another 6 months, so be it. I write far more hack code at work. I also try to continually learn how to optimize the code by taking better advantage of python and dependencies. The code didn't start out fast. When I got a 500x speedup in a critical module that took a problem from 45 minutes to 4 seconds, well that was pretty neat. You'd be surprised what you can write in 7 years, even if you write while drunk once in a while. I code by throwing darts at the wall approach. I have 26000 tests.
Someone smarter than you might have seen it
There are many ways to kill a cat. Thank you for your suggestion. 
Which Linux distro do you recommend for a beginner. Also were can I get it to download. 
Is there any OpenDocument format that works as PDF in the sense that it's just a rendered document? Because while someone could just send an .odt directly to me, I'd like to sometimes open it in a reader rather than an editor. 
Also being in open source, people don't want to commit subpar code for public to see and berate them.
Also being in open source, no one would be using their library if that hadn't made all the right choices for at least a little while. 
That is looking pretty slick! Loving how concise the code is
stahp he's already dead
What makes you think they're smarter? Having looked at lots of open source code there's very little code that made me think "wow, the author is smart". Maybe they just have more free time, or more energy to write code in their spare time.
(1) is vague: number is a concept that is not immediately applicable to languages, which is what you are dealing with. These are all examples of numbers: 1e-100, -π^i, 0xFF, "сорок восемь". You probably want to express it as a language rule, say, "not a digit", or "neither digit nor minus, nor plus". The rest is easy, but, I think your specific problem was combining the two, so, I'll try to reflect on that. First, the solution: ^[^\d+-].*201[789] This ensure that the matched string doesn't start with digit and contains the years you wanted, however, it may contain strings like "120178", which may not be relevant for you, because, coincidentally they contain the year you are looking for, but they don't really mean it the way you do. As for the regex: 1. First `^` (caret) instructs the matcher to apply the regex at the beginning of the input only. 2. `[^X]` is a way to saying "match any character that is not in class `X`. 3. `\d+-` defines a character class as a union of digits (0..9) and signs "plus" and "minus". Be sure that if you modify this expression, the minus sign is the last one in it, otherwise, it has a special meaning in the character class specification language. 4. .* instructs to match any character (except new lines) zero or more times. 5. `201` matches that string literally. 6. `[789]` matches either 7, 8, or 9 digits. Without giving too deep into theory, you can use this as a rule: if you want to perform a logical and on two regular expressions: if they apply to the same chunk of the input, it's a set intersection operation (typically, you'd have to find which parts of source expressions will match both inputs, and keep just those); if they apply to different chunks, it's a concatenation operation (typically, you'll simply add a `.*` between two parts).
some of them aren't smarter, but since they manage to produce code that is helpful to many others, they are definitely much more hardworking than the average procrastinator :-)
Go to a convention and talk to them or read their blogs. Most are normal humans. They tend to be successful for the same reason kids can beat me at new games. Time investment and passion. I think accepting that at some point most people have imposter syndrome or feelings of inadequacy helps. Don't focus your limited brain juice on that. Read one more book. A few more lines of code. Write lots of little stuff to make your own life better at home or work. Eventually you get to the best version of you and if you do find a problem to solve that many others have too maybe you get the next requests. But even if you don't, most of us don't, you're still getting better at fighting back the chaos.
I personally found it difficult. I think there was some issues with the Python API Wrapper, but these may be fixed. Your best bet is to probably search GitHub for someone who has already done it (search for the newest update will most likely give you the best results)
That sort of thing is definitely possible, and an ideal candidate for a python script. I've written something similar in the past. You're already off to a good start by breaking the problem down into individual steps. If I was you, I'd make a new .py file and add each step as a comment with a line or two between them e.g. # Wait 10 minutes # Check if drive is available # etc. Next I'd use my search engine of choice to figure out how to implement the first step. Your search term could be "python wait" or "python time delay". You will find that you'll need the sleep function from the time. You'll need to import it once at the top of your script, then you can use it e.g. from time import sleep # Wait 10 minutes (600 seconds) sleep(600) # Check if drive is available # etc. Once you've got that working, move on to the next step.
Unless there is a CoC.
I still prefer PDF to ODT for export format. But PDF is hard to extract tables or text. It seems like everything are just vector graphics... Extracting texts isn't very consistent.
Support of ODT should be for a while, as long as OpenOffice.org and LibreOffice are still using it; as a free competitor to Microsoft Office. Yes, PDF is very mature, but ...^ see above.
The way I've seen this done is by spinning up some Azure VMs that are set up with the required packages. Then put a link up on the whiteboard, and a number on each desk, so they can each get a different VM to work on. Getting some low-power VMs for a couple of hours is pretty cheap if not free, and I believe (although I've not done it myself) that Azure gives some nice tooling to help. Also, since presumably this will be done on university machines that the school kids don't have logins for, I'm guessing you'll have demonstrators or other helpers logging into the machine to set them up before the kids arrive. In that case you'll be able to get them to open up the right notebook server at the same time. Something to think about is what you want the students to get out of the lesson. Is it going to be a walkthrough where they run prewritten cells, will they copy and paste code in, or are you expecting them to write some code themselves? If so, how long is the session? Some (non-physics) materials you might want to look at as a potential basis: http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/ http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/ (If you're not familiar with Software Carpentry, check them out, they offer lessons and workshops targeted at new graduate students, but that teach skills applicable to all researchers that you might not already know. The lesson materials are designed so they can be followed independently if you can't get to a workshop.) Since you're going to be teaching the material (and may also be doing teaching of undergrads, and may has aspirations of doing so as a lecturer once you finish your PhD) I'd also recommend checking out [their Instructor Training](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/) and this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmVKGxPlTvc) from the person who wrote them in the first place—I've found these more informative and motivating than any other teaching course I've been on.
I met the creator of sympy once. Super awesome dude, he somehow found me interesting enough to chat with me for an hour at a bar mixer of python developers. Apparently his secret for having time was to sleep 4 hours a night for the first couple years while getting the project put together. He tried to not sacrifice time with his wife and kids by just sacrificing sleep. Once the project was big enough he didn't have to anymore. I mostly just looked at him like he was crazy, and ordered a strong drink afterwards. To be fair, he's from somewhere in eastern Europe and goes around dressed like a cowboy, hat and all. Really cool dude, 10/10 would chat with him over a couple beers again. The SciPy conference (where this happened) was really humbling for me. I've had coworkers tell me in a big fish in a small pond, because where I live (Arkansas) there aren't a lot of devs, and there aren't a lot of jobs, and the ones that are here mostly suck. I consider myself a pretty decent dev given my experience. Going to SciPy, you end up in a room with core devs for jupyter, numpy, scipy, pandas, matplotlib, dask, and many more libraries. Also, like half of the attendees are phds from around the world. I felt like a minnow in the ocean there. 
And take a look at the [Pycon 2015 Keynote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIJdFxYlEKE) by Jacob Kaplan-Moss, Loosely, the topic of which is "Hi, I'm Jacob, and I'm a mediocre programmer".
Thanks for the info! I should have specified that these tutorials would be for them to do in their spare time, rather than in a class, so I'm not really in control of the programming environment. Hence why I was hoping to find some simple browser based environment that has a couple of modules pre-loaded. My dream scenario would be a Jupyter notebook that I can simply send the URL of, but it requires them to have a working installation of Python.
Also being in open source, they get feedback very quickly from other very good programmers.
Complex things are just lots and lots of simple things put together. 
It was just an expression. I would really like to learn something from you! Peace!!
This one made my day!! 
Sometimes there are people who search for students to make them a website (which you *could* do with django and html) Other than that I personally have never encountered anything.
Yeah, I would really like a starting point. Share github link if possible..
I know a lot of smart people like that and while some of it is natural talent it's definitely a learnable skill. If you want to get there you just need to code, watch some YouTube, and know how to read. The different imo between very smart people and "everyone else" is that the smart people put their energy into being smarter and everyone else puts their energy into other things.
Yeah.
Don't have kids! Either that or give up sleep (even with or without a project) 
Could I ask what the optimization was? 
I'm not sure if such a post belongs on this subreddit, or the learnpython subreddit. I've posted this on the learnpython subreddit, and I'll delete this post if it doesn't belong here.
Thanks, I will give it a try. 
Just read how other python projects are organised. You listed a few yourself. Good projects always start with good planning. From there it's a matter of filling in the blanks and iterating. 
I think the CoC is currently a hot topic with the updated Linux CoC. Which is why I made the comment.
Even if the dude above is a genius his stance on this just screams insecurity 
There are no jobs "in python" period. Knowing django might help some, but bottom line, people are hired for programming ability, not for their proficiency in a specific language. I mean, it helps and would probably make a difference if you were an expert in more obscure langs like COBOL, SQL, or erlang, but everybody knows python, and it's an easy language to learn on top of that. Don't market yourself as a python coder, market yourself as a programmer. 
Hear yee hear yee!
Yep, they've got some domain specific knowledge and are good at breaking big problems into little problems.
&gt; am I the only person No. Though many would use `logging.debug()` there. It internally checks the currently-configured log level. And can happily ship into production. &gt; the real world Yup. The innermost parts are the most pure and the external most parts have the most side-effects. Even the most pure example has a single outermost layer doing some IO to print the result - not having side-effects makes the program useless. Testing and reasoning about the parts with side-effects is painful, so try to minimize them but never eliminate.
&gt; Even if the dude above is a genius his stance on this just screams insecurity https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humour Insecurity is what you'll experience looking at my open source projects ;-)
Thanks for the advice :)
So what do you suggest how do I handle the account login if the tool is being used by others? Because this service requires username and password. Along with that an OTP is sent to their mobile. How do I handle this ?
Yeah a lot of people don’t realize that code for libraries is specifically designed to look good to the public. Coding a library actually takes longer than other tasks because you have to make sure it’s presentable beyond being functional. It takes 2-3 times as long to finish projects this way. It’s less about being smart, and more about effort. At least that’s the way I do it, and I think everyone else does it the exact same way.
Same goes for a lot of industry developing. I wouldn't dare put subpar code out for review at my job. My team is gonna look at and then some jackass down the line, probably me, will have to look at it later and try to figure out wtf I did. 
&gt;Honestly classes are unnecessary in 80% of use cases This is what I've found as well. When I first started learning Python, my first language ever, I was desperate to figure out classes because Python is an object oriented language. Classes are what "you're supposed to do". One day it *finally* clicked and I totally understood classes, but in doing so I realized I don't even need them 80% of the time, as you said. I've barely used them at all since then, opting instead for short, well defined functions that take few parameters and (ideally) perform only one task each. Classes are overrated
Really? OP didn't seem to take that as humor. Something even tells me you made the dude feel bad just to stroke your ego for a bit.
Is it even possible to make all of the right choices. One thing that makes a huge difference in the open source world is the freedom to follow your own path thus the many libraries that do the “same thing” rather well. In a world where there is seldom a perfect choice, people will gravitate to the best choice for them. If not that the solution that has the most common interest. 
im not a seasoned programmer, but you should take a look to codewars, proyect euler and code abbey, they have programming challenges of increasing dificulties so you will probably find a nice level for you
It takes time, practice, and direction. Remember that by the time you hear of some large open source library, it's probably already been in development for years with many authors with best practices. And remember in most cases - they didn't create the patterns or algorithms there, they wrote implementations of things others have discovered and perfected, which have often been written in other languages. We all stand on the shoulders of others. Also remember that many people are paid to work on this software (presumably google pays people to work on tensorflow and other libraries, etc), they may have full time project management, etc. As a final note, many are specialists who have spent a lot of time studying particular fields. Don't be discouraged by someone with 10-20 years of experience in programming and data science or nlp knowing a lot more than you. Instead, use them as inspiration for your own study.
I've contributed a new feature numpy and have some mixed open source contributions, but I wouldn't necessarily say that makes me a genius or even above average intelligence. I was bored one day and frustrated with the way things were and decide to submit a pull request. And I was too stubborn to let it die and sheparded through the reviews and rebases until it was accepted. And then had to fix the bugs that were revealed and had to comment on all the stupid issues brought up about it. It wasn't anything special. I ported a feature from R, I didn't let it die and I only did it because I was trying to avoid real work. I was lucky to have found a feature I wanted, but one no one else had implemented. I've never found something else I could pr in since.

On the other hand there most certainly are smarter people out there. These smarter people exist in any profession. I know this because I’ve run into some extremely smart people my time, many levels above me. The funny thing is others have considered me to be smart. As for smart I’m less inclined to consider myself smart but rather I’m not lazy! To this end a good portion of what people consider to be a sign of intelligence is really just an internal drive to work on something. Sometimes that drive results in a bit of unbalance in ones personal life and responsibilities. “Smarter” does not means better person. 
Believe me not everyone can code. There is a segment of society that just doesn’t have the intelligence. Most of us lie in the middle of that bell shaped curve. As such you can’t dismiss the fact that some programmers lie at the other end of the curve. That is there are a few extremely smart people in this field. 
They're not. You just think they are. Go try to work on those open source projects. At first you will have a hard time, but if you stick to it you will eventually understand the code and be able to make meaningful contributions. You can even go work on the Linux Kernel if you want. It's not hard, it's just a thing you don't know about yet. 
I think you missed a tester function for `bridge_hand_shorthand`.
Going to such a conference must have been interesting! As for PHd’s I see obtaining such a degree as a sign of hard work and drive as it is a sign of general intelligence. There are certainly PHd’s Out there way off the scale I ntelligence wise but you can’t dismiss the effort that goes into getting such a degree.

Take a task you know how to do manually, like doing a few formulas un excel. Now try to replicate doing that in python with xlsx writer and pandas. Pandas you will be able to create an array of numbers and you can turn this into a dataframe (tabular data like the output of SQL). With this data now in memory, you can manipulate it. In the example i am providing. Figure out how to create the writer object via xlsx and then write the dataframe into the file created. The documentation will provide you with the way to then write formulas in excel. (Note, writing formulas in excel are for the example, but you can also do the same manipulations in the dataframe. Then you can paste a finished product to excel!). Goos luck, everyone was terrible when they started programming, don't beat yourself up and understand it can take awhile.
Yes they have. 
Indeed. The dtype system is something that I know Travis is quite proud of. He is very thoughtful and very smart, and tackled a very hard problem. You have to keep in mind that at the time he was creating Numpy, he had to integrate the best bits of Numeric and Numarray, both libraries with lots of users and very different internal architectures. It is one of the few times that reality has run counter to the old "existing N APIs suck, I'll make a new one so now we have N+1 APIs." 
Thanks for the advice. Do you think any companies would accept volunteer work for experience?
Use a service to handle the SMS sent to the mobile: https://www.twilio.com/docs/sms/tutorials/how-to-receive-and-reply The user name and password you'll save off. Like I said some sort of credential manager, the thing is to post to a site that doesn't support it you'll need the actual user name and password not a hashed version. There is some inherent risk. Providers which support an API key make it where you won't need their actual passwords. 
It sounds like your intent was stir the pot but not really add anything of value.
I don’t understand what you mean what does it do
Then there's a good chance they have an api, just not a public one. Get Fiddler/Charles and you can check the requests that app does. Then just emulate them in your script.
Thanks . But looks like my cookie method is simpler and would work for most cases. I could just encrypt and store the cookie file , first time the user manually logs in. After that whenever, he wants to make automatic payments, I'll just decrypt the cookie and use it for logging him in. Twilio doesn't seem to help. I have used it earlier. It requires you to purchase a number for receiving and sending messages . But the users would have already used a number to make their accounts on the payment platform. So I don't think twilio will work here. I guess I'll stick with the cookie method.
I was aiming more for comedy based on a shared experience than pissing people off. But some of that comedy is certainly the heightened emotions people are experiencing from the whole ordeal.
Fantastic comment. I think of library writers as normal people who happen to have a passion for something and thus apply a fair amount of time at it. By no means do I want to lump myself into the category op is referring to, but I'd like to share that I simply got into open source contributions as a way to learn to write better software.
Also, is it possible to use Charles/Fiddler on the website itself instead of the app ?
How does anyone find time for any hobbies or fun activity? You find the time, and often it comes at a trade-off of not doing other things (e.g., a little less time browsing Reddit each day provides a lot of time over the course of a year).
I’m actually a business management major. I’m aspiring to create a startup related to upcoming technologies and I figure I should get to know what I want to build a business around. Even if that does not work out I’m sure what I’m learning will not go to waste. Thanks for directing me to that sub
Awesome, will definitely check it out!
Don't think that other people are smarter than you because of a some accomplishment. Some people just give it all they got, obsess with stuff and work 18 hours straight until they solve the issue. They stay up late, yell at anyone who interrupts them while they are working, and think they are more productive just because they take their work more seriously. It's better to have the common sense to stop working on a dead end problem for an hour or so and do some research or ask someone for help.
Hello! I'm a bot! It looks to me like your post might be better suited for r/learnpython, a sub geared towards questions and learning more about python. That said, I am a bot and it is hard to tell. I highly recommend posting your question there. Please follow the subs rules and guidelines when you do post there, it'll help you get better answers faster. Show /r/learnpython the code you have tried and describe where you are stuck. **[Be sure to format your code for reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/faq#wiki_how_do_i_format_code.3F)** and include which version of python and what OS you are using. *** ^(this bot is written and managed by /u/IAmKindOfCreative) ^(This bot is currently under development and experiencing changes to improve its usefulness)
Are you gonna tell us what it is?
He might not want to because it seems as though his github account is not under the same name as his reddit account.
It is less so being smarter and more so having will and passion. Anyone can make a library. And anyone can commit to a library. Not everyone can do it consistently. To do so consistently, in creation, one needs the passion to solve an unsolved or poorly solved existing problem, and the will to maintain it indefinitely. To contribute one needs the passion for the existing project and the will to not give a shit about credit (because it is unlikely they will get any for a decent chunk of time). Both need the capability to make time for this project beyond what they get payed for.
If I can look at a GitHub repo to see someone's work that probably tells me a bit. Volunteering for open source can allow that. If I'm looking for someone to get me solutions I'm not exceptionally concerned with why they can. Unless it's theft or something. I'm also going to talk to them etc during the process. I do not have a degree in CS or related and I did not start in the field. I was a hobbyist that built proveable skills. But being a kid does limit your current options a bit. And that's not really a bad thing.
Seems to be back now.
all possible latlons is a plane, can be represented in a 2d list. all points on the list have a single country designation. you now have a 3d list [f][f][str]. to get a random location in a country pull a sublist by the 3rd element and pull a select a random element of that sub list. or is there something im missing?
There's a lot of lat/longs possible in a country, no?
This is the most interesting question I've run across in a while ... I imagine it'll be hard, and the only way I can think of is both hard and inexact. But here it is: - _somehow_ represent the country as a collection of little squares on a grid, [like this](https://media.istockphoto.com/vectors/germany-dotted-map-germany-map-dots-highly-detailed-pixelated-germany-vector-id881260522) - choose one of those squares at random - return some arbitrary point within the square
Almost every payment service has an API. With which service are you trying to integrate?
I can't even think of anything off the top of my head.
Functions make a better API, more easily composable and more understandable.
It's way more impressive when the problems are big. Days to minutes...wow! You'll now want to run bigger problems. My standard problem has gone up by 10x. I'm impatient, but 30 seconds means I can get coffee.
Interesting method, but as you said, basically the same as the last method which sounds computationally intensive. [Just came across this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_in_polygon), so maybe if I found a way to express a country as a polygon I could replicate one of the methods here?
For the most part no. There are legal issues with that, and they have little to no guarantee you'll be able to contribute. The majority of dev work is not writing code. It is collaborating with other devs.
Work on something that is interesting to you.
you may create a random lat lon that is inside the country borders using packages like geopandas. you can try a while loop until it is included. what do you think?
Well, they're represented by real numbers so in theory there's an infinite number, you only need enough to reach a level of detail suitable for what you want (and you can always fudge the rest by adding a random real value to each latlon after you know it's on land just randomly adjust it by up to 20m or so. I'm sure you can find data for the ranges of latlon that are on land or an API to check if a latlon is over land/water.
Nice. It has a security flaw but that code is useless anyway and doesn't need to exist. 
6 years ago I made my first contribution to a small project, just fixing a tiny annoyance of mine. I took me two weeks and a lot of back and forth with the dev of the time to for example ... not put semicolon at the end of lines, find the right style and the right location in files. That was my first contribution to IPython QtConsole to add a keyboard shortcut. That lead me to become a core dev of IPython and one of the founders of Jupyter. Write something you _care_ about, after some time you'll be an expert, without realising it.

You may want to ask /r/gis for general advice on how to determine whether a point is inside a given country or not. Your question is more topical there, anyway.

Out of curiosity, do you have any links for MSOffice Python packages? As shitty as they may be, there might be something there that's useful for me.
I just quickly looked at code but didn't read it, 5 is not in there? 2 to the power of 5 is 32, your list does not contain 32, not sure what your issue is.
Tangential, but I just made the transition from big fish in a small pond to a total nobody at a big-n. It's 100% good for my career, but I'd surely be lying if I said I was happier.
This could work. How do I check if it's in the country borders?
I think PDF was *designed* to make editing and extraction hard: i.e. to be like printing on digital paper. IMO, .odt, is only a good format for people who use LibreOffice. I think most MSOffice users may have problems with opendocument type files the same way there are issues with .docx files in LibreOffice. 
First hit on Google when searching for "Paytm API": https://business.paytm.com/developers-api Did you not attempt to search for an API?
Even if you're in the smartest 1% of all human beings alive today, there are 75,000,000 humans smarter than you. The beauty of open source is that we self-select for the best work and we get to save that work and re-use it forever. I have no illusions about my abilities. I can glue things together pretty well, and that apparently makes me one of the smarter people out there. But I look like a drooling idiot compared to the people who wrote the things I'm gluing together. But as long as they keep paying me obscene amounts to play arts and crafts, I won't complain.
Take a look at your old code. Get another couple programmers to look at your old code. See how much it has improved after a week.
I mean to do it like one of the other commends said, store a grid of land latlons pick a grid coord and then pick a spot from the grid.
You can start generating a random latitude (or longitude) and check the bounds for the valid longitudes for that latitude. I mean choosing a line across the country, then a point of that line that lies within the country (which I believe it's not very hard to determine with some kind of intersection between the line and the country borders).
If so, please share it with me!
I really think it’s best to think of this as primarily a skill which most people can develop. Successful projects often get that way from a combination of quality of craft – less genius insight than attention to detail — and especially the ability to keep in mind the learning curve for someone who is less experienced with that library/topic. Much of that really comes down to time and prioritization, and a healthy dose of luck for getting adoption and support. Using an example, requests is super popular but early on there were plenty of people who asked why you needed it when it didn’t do anything you couldn’t do with the stdlib or other libraries. The genius wasn’t in cutting edge networking development but in Kenneth Reitz having a really good sense for a Pythonic API and appreciating the advantages of lowering the cognitive load for routine work. 
I agree, not everyone can do it. That would be insane. I'm saying if your goal is to write a program that's used by multitudes of people, that's an achievable goal.
I would guess that most of the people contributing to those packages use them for work and it's part of their job. There are some people who do contributions in their spare time, but that's pretty thankless work IMO.
I am quite sure that you can use geopandas with a shapefile with country borders. however, there is also a python package that does exactly this but I don't remember its name. once I open my laptop I will check into my code.
Actually they are not. You are just looking at the product of months of work, trying to digest it in a few minutes. 
&gt; I'm not clear on the case that you're referring to that makes numpy slow, but it sounds like there is a better way to do it that does take advantage of numpy properly. The "solution" would be to rewrite a big chunk of our domain logic in C in order to eliminate the linear cost of calling between C and Python. This entails modifications to our build and deploy infrastructure as well as training for our engineers on how to write, debug, and maintain C code in a secure way. Instead, I rewrote it in an afternoon using a Python list and a for loop and performance was acceptable.
Oh my fucking god he fucking dead [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSccP3-ZoG8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSccP3-ZoG8)
Are you thinking of PostGIS?
Thank you!
here: https://regionmask.readthedocs.io/en/stable/
no, just a piece of software able to tell you if a point is inside a polygon shape defined by a shapefile. I normally use R for this however geopandas should do the trick if you use a proper shapefile (like what you can find on natural earth)
Your problem is ancillarily connected to two other interesting issues - that of partitions, like Voronoi partitioning, and that of hulls. **Approximation 1: Bounding boxes** Let B be an array of tuples `(lat, lon)` that describe a boundary point of the country. Then, the bounding box is defined as the rectangle ABCD of each of `(min_lat, lon)`, `(max_lat, lon)`, `(lat, min_lon)`, `(lat, max_lon)`. In other words, you have to find the tuples with the largest and smallest latitude and longitude values, each. This can be computationally expensive so there are some shortcuts. `numpy` has a built-in called `numpy.min()` and `numpy.max()` that can do this pretty efficiently for you if you're casing the whole thing as a `numpy` array of 2-arrays. Even if it's not sufficient for your purposes, you are most likely going to need the bounding box parameters. Not every number between `(min_lat, min_lon)` and `(max_lat, max_lon)` are going to be in the country, but every point in the country is going to be within the bounding box. Typically, you can only parametrise random number generators with a minimum and a maximum, so if you intend to use a generate-test-discard/keep strategy, these are going to be your best bet – efficient functions to generate a random number within a triangle or some other polygon sadly don't directly exist (there are algorithms to pick random distributions in triangles, described [here](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~funk/tog02.pdf), but it's a hard nut to crack computationally efficiently. **Approximation 2: Convex hull** This is by leaps and bounds better than the bounding box. A convex hull is always bigger than the polygon, but ordinarily by a lot less than the bounding box. There are pretty convenient algorithms to calculate the convex hull of a polygon. Testing a random coordinate generated by the bounding box minima and maxima against being within the convex hull is a pretty good approach. If you're lazy, `shapely` polygon objects have the `.contains(x:Point) -&gt; bool` method that'll do it all for you. If not, you can implement the [Scott ray-casting algorithm](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Ray-casting_algorithm#Python). **Approximation 3: Ray-casting the whole thing** The ray-casting algorithm runs at O(n^2), meaning that the fewer points you've got, the better – the risk being that your point might fall outside the country. In the end, you'll have to figure out how and where you want the balance to be struck between the hull resolution (the number of points circumscribing the boundary) and time. The boundary of a country can be approximated by any number of points larger than three ([the coastline paradox](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coastline_paradox)).

**Coastline paradox** The coastline paradox is the counterintuitive observation that the coastline of a landmass does not have a well-defined length. This results from the fractal-like properties of coastlines, i.e. the fact that a coastline typically has a fractal dimension (which in fact makes the notion of length inapplicable). The first recorded observation of this phenomenon was by Lewis Fry Richardson and it was expanded by Benoit Mandelbrot.The measured length of the coastline depends on the method used to measure it and the degree of cartographic generalization. *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Python/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28
I think a large part comes from already knowing those programmers. If you're a rando writing a library, without being plugged into the social ecosystem, nobody's even going to notice it.
I love programming as well. And I’m glad you’ve found the field that suits you. To increase my general knowledge of python, I use codewars. On this website, you can view challenges in almost all modern languages. Codewars specializes in algorithm challenges. Personally, my rank is 5kyu and I would not be where I am today in programming without this website. As for resources on AI, use Siraj Rival and Sentdex (both youtube channels). I’m no AI programmer myself, (although I’m taking the necessary math courses on khan academy to do so) so take what I say with a grain of salt. Good luck!
This is a terrible solution. If you can create a possible coordinate list to begin with you can test to see if a point is inside some enclosed region. I would do the following 1. Randomly generate a coordinate Z in a space that encloses you Country of interest C 2. Test if Z is in C 3. if Z is in C return Z else goto step 1 This (rejection) sampling technique is constant time, constant memory and evenly samples every coordinate in your country. Think smarter not harder.
I'm assuming you can figure out the necessary imports (shape, cartopy, etc) but this code will get every country boundary: &amp;#x200B; `shpfilename = shpreader.natural_earth(resolution='50m',` `category='cultural',` `name='admin_0_countries')` `reader = shpreader.Reader(shpfilename)` `countries = reader.records()` `all_countries = [country for country in countries]` &amp;#x200B; Pick your favourite country: `for country in all_countries:` `if country.attributes['NAME'] == 'Bangladesh':` `bangladesh_geometry = country` &amp;#x200B; You can then test whether a point is within a country or not `all_points = np.vstack((lons,lats)).T` &amp;#x200B; `for loop_points, point in enumerate(all_points):` `this_point = Point(point)` `find_country = this_point.within(bangladesh_geometry)` &amp;#x200B; This returns true if the point is within the country. &amp;#x200B; You could fairly easily adapt this to do it the other way around. Use the bounds from the geometry to select a random point inside. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
Valid point!
Christ some of these suggestions are bad. I would do the following 1. Randomly generate a coordinate Z in a space that encloses you Country of interest C 2. Test if Z is in C 3. if Z is in C return Z else goto step 1 This (rejection) sampling technique is constant time, constant memory and evenly samples every coordinate in your country. Now for the representation of you country C. I would make a polygon(s) that define the border(∂C) since that representation makes it the computational cost only depend on the complexity of the border and there are some prebuild algorithms that you gets to immediately use that run in O(n) time. As apposed to enumerating a grid and then picking from that grid, it runs in O(n^2) time and losses grid resolution FAST if you want to be able to run a largish country (For the USA with only a 1km^2 grid it would take ~ 120MB) Think smarter not harder. 
They aren't called import functions, they're called modules. And you don't have to memorize their APIs. It's useful to know what you will find in a module so you know where to look when you need something. Some useful modules are math, sys, os, iterator (or something like that) and maybe subprocess and thread, for a start.

I am thinking of using PDF for exporting format, but I need an editable format. I have had hard time looking for one... beyond `*.xlsx`... It should be possible to render `*.odt` solely in Python, then export to PDF (but I am not too sure about that.)
Practice makes perfect. You too could be a SME in any field given enough time.
&gt;The whole post is more based on a feeling that looking at code in a library it looks impressive. But isn't this nearly always the case for a large code base? Lol, no? Most large code bases are garbage, they're just hidden inside companies.
All the lines in that block that start with self. are over-indented 
You don't need to indent lines 62-70 after your import statement. They should be the same indent level.
In fact every line that starts with self. is over-indented
Niceee, in future you should add comments and docstrings so people can better understand your code, but this is great 
Just what I needed to complete my college's project.
Hm, I'm not sure what you mean. When I work on python projects, I lock down the python interpreter version and use a local instance of pyenv.
Have you considered [geopip](https://github.com/tammoippen/geopip): you can select the shape file you like, and it basically computes the point in polygon, to see wether a coordinate is in one of the contained polygons / countries.
Working on a webscraper &amp; implimenting gui automation for my supervisor to create performance reports. Maybe next I'll propose a eink display to show productivity for the day that refreshes at lunch and clock out time.
python has specific rules about indented lines. You can not indent line 62 (or all your "self." lines) FWIW - The error message, "unexpected indent" ... is a pretty good clue for what is wrong.
"In some case, function can make a better API. Use the tool that fit your needs" &amp;#x200B; Yeah ! I agree with your non-dogmatic answer ! Have a nice day pal!
Maybe I am not understanding the parameters. I imagined the function is something like this: def random\_latlon\_within\_country(country): return(lat,lon) so what your saying is just keep throwing random lat,lon values at a map until you find one that returns the country specified? Seems that the smaller the country, the longer you'll have to run it. My solution is O(1), since you start with a list of lat,lon for every country, and randomly select one from within that list. &amp;#x200B; Imagine there was a country that only had a capital, or a single point on a map. You would statistically never find it with a guess &amp; check method. My method would return that single point with one list shuffle.
If you want to start a business, learn how to build websites, learn about Django, maybe flask. Learn how to automate things, that was my favourite, and the most helpful to me.
Not always. Python can give people a lot of bad practices and false assumptions. I think starting people in C is the way to go so they will understand fundamentally why you should't just assume all high-level hand waving is peachy.
Some of this is the classic imposter syndrome. If I focus on threads threads, and nothing but threads, then I probably am going to blow your threading knowledge out of the water. I might not be able to do file io worth a damn. There is also some darwin involved. If I put up a crappy (gets 3 stars) library; you probably don't know about it. If I put up an awesome 4,000 star library, you might know about it. Unless there is some other hype behind my library, I doubt I can get to 4,000 stars without making something well. 
`hashk` is an integer, but you’re comparing it with strings later on. These comparisons will always be false, so none of the loops will be executed. 
Sounds like a beautiful accident waiting to happen. ***"Man automates online payment process and accidentally buys 2,147,483,647 items. Says he is thankful he did not use longs.".***
There is no need to limit yourself to class or functional design. When I start on a project I often do not know how this will work out. often a function may solve it or it may be easier to abstract it in a class. After years of perl, php, java, scala, javascript and python, I've learned that there are lots of programming patterns out there that might fit.
....with respect I don't get the relevance of your comment here whatsoever
Why remove the question? I was going to read this later but now it's gonneeee.
I've gotten some feedback that the font is small... I'll increase it for the 3rd video. Any other feedback would be helpful.
Good job brother! Clear, simple and to the point. Other than the visibility of the code, it's great.
Generate a random coordinate pair, feed into Google places API, check state or country to verify it's on land, if not generate another coordinate pair.
Can u improve readability by using PEP8, as a young Programmer that will help you importe your coding style
I haven't listened to the podcast yet but a very nice list of many libs I wasn't aware of.
well, if you dont want to make it difficult with graphics, I would suggest a console implementation, maybe with a black square character meaning a closed door, a C for car and a G for goat further that that, the implementation is pretty straightforward, import random and an array to store the doors
No your algorithm NOT O(1). First you must construct a list off m*m grid points (already O(n^2)) then you want to shuffle or sort them( at least O(n) to O(nln(n))). On top of the problem that you don't uniformly sample that space but only at discrete points, you could miss quite a bit of local features in your approximation. Obviously you would have to scale your sample space to your region of intrest to make it scale invariant. refer to step 1, (a space that encloses C) a minimal bounding box or set of bounding box regions if C is not connected would clear your worries about scale variance. Thirdly, it is quite clear that your samples should be drawn from the output of intrest. If you want to sample from a finite enumerated set it would be far better to just directly sample that set. Monti carlo approaches are useful for infinite sets, highly dimensional functions and the like.
Thank you! Yea, I just heard from someone else. I'll make this next one bigger. Next up are windows that stay open. &amp;#x200B;
No legitimate operation would offer this; I'm sure you can find someone that will "let you work for experience" to build them a website or app/service prototype, but these people will have nothing to teach and it is usually far **far** more trouble than its worth(probably half the field has fallen for this trick when we were your age). Honestly, spending the next 2 years working on established open source projects is the best path forward. Hiring below 18 is a pain and would require extra training for several people above you, hiring below 16 can get legally questionable *real* quick depending on which state you are in. Until you get older you will be viewed as a liability nightmare in the eyes of many HR depts and most office environments are not setup to handle minors in their workforce.
This is exactly what I've been looking for. Thanks!
Which question? 
I use gephi, it's a programme outside python. I use networkx mostly to create the networks and get statistics. 
They are not, why do you think they are?
[Already did that](https://habr.com/post/313452/#comment_9879654). &amp;#x200B;
OK, thanks for the advice :)
You should have a slogan like Django does. "The native GUI framework for perfectionists with deadlines". All in all, thanks for the awesome project, I sure use it instead of CLI to make it easy on my colleagues.
Thanks for this tutorial! What do you think about this one vs. Tkinter?
&gt; Is it just plain interest/hard work Mostly, yes. Plus being given the time and opportunity to pursue those interests and expend that hard work. You can have all the passion for a topic but if you are busy sweeping floors to house and feed yourself and your family you might not be able to pursue the said passion. &gt; Or they are just simply smarter than us? No. In fact, often the people who excel in a vertical field are not the ones most identified or seen as experts in that field. Again, refer back to being given the opportunity to spend the necessary time. &gt; Are there any particular steps to be followed to reach at that level? See the aforementioned interest/hard work.
Wow, hard to say. I could use many of them. But a couple grabbed my attention a little more: * fSociety: Because I'd like to use it to perform some Chaos Engineering via the [Chaos Toolkit](https://chaostoolkit.org/) (Maybe, it'll be popular enough to get on your podcast ;)) * Prophet: I would like to see if I can apply it to some of the data I have (it also reminds me of the new [Google Inference API](https://cloud.google.com/inference/) * SertpentAI because it looks a lot of fun * mimesis and API Star also look useful so I'll explore them (I use [Connexion](https://github.com/zalando/connexion) for a similar task of the latter). 
Definitely not smarter in all cases. Open source contributors are definitely passionate, though. A lot of people that program as their day job don’t want to think about work when they get home. Others come home from their programming job and write code until they fall asleep.
Good job :) &amp;#x200B;
I'm a **big** tkinter fan! I just don't want to write tkinter code. PySimpleGUI "wraps" tkinter. It makes the tkinter calls so you don't have to. You get all the same widgets, look and feel, etc, as a tkinter program. But the two **interfaces** look completely different.
I use the official documentation. What are you struggling with? I have to admit I did not make the transition from 1.1 to 2.x yet.. 
For sure change your CLI apps you give to people. You can even package them into a .EXE file if they're on Windows. They'll love you for it if they're non-computer people. I still find it pretty wild these short little programs can be turned into EXE files that look like a "windows program".
It does seem to be ASGI by piggy-backing off of uvicorn (but it also lists ASGI as a "future TODO", so I'm not 100% sure of this either. I also may be missing something, but it's not clear to me that ASGI will be significantly faster than standard deployments of WSGI apps (e.g., where your deployment on multi-core systems ends up running several parallel WSGI workers).
Now how do I write an interview question that tests for this?
Actually, if you draw a rectangle around the country and keep generating a lat/long inside the rectangle until you hit a point that's on land, then I think you'll be fine.
The "in a space that encloses your country" part is typically "in the smallest lat/lon rectangle that encloses the country". If you pick England, you know the farthest east, north, west, south extent of the country, so don't bother picking samples outside that rectangle. With points inside that rectangle, do the test. The ratio of good vs rejected samples then depends on the crinkly-ness of the shape, not the overall size of the country.
I'm going thru a quantum chemistry course and I am trying to document the math in sympy/numpy as notebooks so I an take arbitrary inputs and see what would happen. Actual Eigenvalue problem solving seems to be a pain in numpy, if anyone could give me a resource better understand these types of problems in a python setting, that would be fantastic.
Then you are saying that op is talking bs.. I don't get the point of this post tbh

I feel like I have heard the term "array" used more broadly than this to also refer to 2-D data (matrices/dataframes), but I'm not sure because I honestly never learned the technical definition. This image matches how I think about these terms though. Anybody with more knowledge on this want to chime in? 
I personally hate PySimpleGUI. It's so unreadable. And you don't have any control over what's happening compared to a full fledged tkinter app. PyQt is obviously superior to both in terms of features, but I think that pysimpleGUI takes away too much of the code to a point that's barely understandable if you didn't write it yourself.
Ah, okay. See, I am coming from R and have only started with Python, so that's probably where the difference in terminology comes from. 
Does python even have arrays and vectors?
Pretty much the same in matlab, I don't really differentiate between these three either. In the end, it's all just data to be analyzed. 
It does if you use a library that has native C bindings and uses them to differentiate between the types. Numpy is known for doing this. The result is that you get some type constraints, but native ndarray operations are super performant compared to normal list operations.
Not built-in, Python originally has lists and tuples. You can install numpy, which introduces arrays to Python, it's fairly easy to learn. I suggest [Python Datascience Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/02.00-introduction-to-numpy.html) to get started with numpy, it's an excellent tutorial.
In C: - Array - Array of arrays - Array of arrays of arrays - Array of `void*` arrays - Array of arrays - Array of `void*`
You want [Automate The Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com). 
Tensors
This isn't related to Python
Yea I feel like array is a bit more of a general term than a 3 dimensional object 
I am coming across many instances where there are isolated clusters in my final visualization, so I am debating whether to have multiple views of each cluster zoomed up, or running different centrality measures prior to the draw step and only visualize high value results. with so many isolated clusters, the initial output is so far zoomed out, that looks like a mess. From an analytical standpoint and assuming I am the only one using this tool, it is totally OK and I can pan/zoom as I need, but if I want to share this with other individuals, or other teams, I wanted to make it a little bit more presentable. When getting into eigenvector centrality, I struggle with the easiest way to transition to another graph specifically looking at high Eigen score nodes. Since eigenvector looks at nodes that are connected to other highly connected nodes, I worry that if I take the wrong steps, that I will leave out nodes in that particular cluster that do not have similarly high Eigen scores. In short, what is the best way to target and map clusters that contain the high Eigen score nodes I believe I use 2.2? But def a 2.x Thanks! 
That would be great thanks

I turned up the volume on the video and on Windows 10, and I can still just barely hear what's going on.
 It requires you to register your business with them before they give you the API details. I don't own any business. 
Didnt explain enough my bad. The tool is written almost exclusively in python, the GUI is to be written in python, and more specifically i was looking for an answer about etiquette in the python specific culture. I figure its different between different enough languages id need to come ask the people directly.
By "Interfaces" I mean the functions and classes you call. &amp;#x200B;
Drat! I just got this microphone... I''ll turn it up! I don't think I can edit the video that's already posted. &amp;#x200B;
That would do it. I know Linux always looks up AAAA records, and I know Windows won't look up AAAA records if it thinks you don't have v6. I don't know what OSX does but I suspect it's probably more on the Windows side (and in either case, you won't be able to make v6 connections without ISP support). There's some kind of NAT64 network test functionality in OSX that's designed for exactly the use case of testing iOS programs on v4-only networks (I kinda assumed you were already using it).
So far, I seem to be the only one who brought it up. I'll try it with headphones next.
I think the last two would be considered lists in C as well (linked lists are especially common).
Somewhat around 1000-2000
It's not bad with reasonably priced headphones.
Would generating random points and filtering on whether they lie [inside a polygon](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-check-if-a-given-point-lies-inside-a-polygon/) or not be helpful? A country polygon GeoJSON may be found [here](https://github.com/datasets/geo-countries/tree/master/data). Good luck.

How do you show in an image that an array is defined as a fixed size while a vector can have N number of elements? - IMO that’s what needs to be emphasized Plus an array can be 1d and more than 2d If one would want.... lastly - where’s the love for hash or dictionary objects with keys ?? And I digress.... :-)
I brought it up in matplotlib first, was directed to the numpy forums which then ended up being taken over by someone else who wanted something better and discussion about his own method. I had gotten some positive sentiment in the meantime, so I went ahead, but my initial attempt to gather some support had 3 comments directed towards me and 25 directed to the random spruiking his own method. I put the PR together, had about 10 people comment over the period of 2 months, almost all with style concerns (except for a request for tests), at least 4 rebases required to due to upstream commits. It was finally accepted after a lot of bikeshedding. I then realised there was a bug we'd all missed, put together a PR for the bug, and it was dropped for 5 months since I didn't keep bumping it. This was only picked up after another upstream commit broke the PR and the feature was already in rc0. I would update the PR every time someone made a comment, rebase instantly (which was quite painful at times). And bump if it had gone inactive for a week. It's about luck - find a feature that you can implement (using another language/maths is always nice), persistence and patience - keep updating and rebasing and not get mad over the constant bike shedding, and communication - get someone in the core team on your side and you navigate the issue of if, and instead have to deal with how.
Doesn't numpy have a specific matrix class, with matrix specific operations, as opposed to the ndarrays, which are pretty much a catch all in numpy?
I think this image is extremely confusing and misleading. If this showed up in a textbook, and I didn't know Python yet, I would be pissed a few weeks later, when I finally figured it out. 
I'm looking for feedback on what you guys want to learn. What do you want to learn how to do with this package? I can record tutorials on any application of the package that you can dream up. &amp;#x200B;
I find this unhelpful
I think you start by contributing and learning and asking for advice, typically. 
The amount of people in the world using numpy and calling themselves data scientists while not even knowing what tensors are is absolutely horrifying

Is that the video that is 2 minutes and 13 seconds long?
No. A tensor is a multilinear map from the cartesian product of vector spaces and their dual spaces into the given field.
I think it more right motivation, practice and experience. Together they combine to appear as talent. It is definitely learnable to be able to write smart code. Motivation - Something feels important to you and you are ready to do to whatever it takes. Practice - You do the same thing over and over again until it becomes natural to you. Deeper level of thinking is revealed to you. Experience - You learn by mistakes to avoid writing bad code. Each iteration is more refined than the last one.
Ignore the other guy, a tensor is just a generalized version of an array. The way I think of tensors is just an n dimensional array. A vector is a tensor, a matrix is a tensor, a 30x30x30x30x30x30x30x4 dimensional array is a tensor.
Can the same be said about Game engine developers? Im sure there are not more than 10 developers in this world as smart as John Carmack for eg.
...Yes I agree
In mathematics and physics, yes. In data-science land, there is no imposed structure on the tensor. It's literally a n-d array.
So data scientists only work with one basis?
Defining the polygon and testing for membership is a non trivial task to someone that hasn’t done it before.
I've heard arrays with more than one index referred to as multidimensional. The confusing thing is that different languages use these terms differently or not at all.
Not a tuple
More generally, you would call "3-d" matrices tensors, contains all the concepts of matrices, but abstracts them to higher dimensions. Not all 2-d datasets make sense to consider as matrices, either. 
I've stumbled into very low level of open source contribution by posting but reports and trying to help figure out what happened by digging into the source code, debugging in PyCharm, testing potential solutions, etc. I'm not even good enough at git to have ever done a pull request, but putting hours into testing and debugging and posting what you learned on the comments on GitHub or Stack overflow is contribution. Also since I'm a Windows user, I can investigate windows bugs more readily than all these Linux / Mac devs. Another way I try to help is by posting a bug report if I find something wrong or confusing in the documentation. There are ways to help besides writing genius library code. In the process of debugging, you'll read a lot of code and figure out how it works and why it was written that way. Learning what good code looks like or as some say, smells like, (hence the term 'code smell') is a critically important skill that you can learn by reading and discussing. I also track the issues of my favorite projects to see how the lead devs discuss things and learn. If there is a chat channel they use, even better. Another suggestion is when you are stumped on a problem and you work it for a while and solve it, consider writing up your question and answer on Stack Overflow for others' benefit, or possibly submitting your code to https://codereview.stackexchange.com/, or at least putting it on GitHub to share.
Yes. You can think of it that way, you can also think about it geometrically, as BittyTang did (effectively, they're saying they same thing, in another language.) That's one of the really cool things about tensors, is that they are such a broad tool that can pop up in many different circumstances. As such, they have a wide variety of definitions and approaches to them, which all take a different perspective of the underlying mathematical structure. 
Is it supposed to be interactive (i.e. the computer plays the TV anchor and the user is the player)? Or are you building a model of the game that describes its properties (i.e. for example, just prints the probabilities, or maybe prints the probabilities given room layout etc.)? There are many ways of doing this, you need to at least hint as to what you wanted to do.
Not necessarily, but you can apply a change of basis to an arbitrary tensor, and not all n-d arrays necessarily make sense under a change of basis, or an ideal basis is trivial to find. A geometric approach is exceedingly general, but may very well be overkill for the problem you're trying to solve. 
This is so confusing. How are lists and vectors different? This picture doesn't answer it. 
PyNastran I think it's called? I have had some conversations with him over the years because we're both in the aerospace field. I have coworkers at NASA who use Nastran, so I thought it was cool to discover the dev on Reddit. Interestingly, I don't know if the Nastran stuff is his day job our his hobby though... lol.
Just built an api that takes in a picture of my co-workers and then returns their names. Looking to turn this into a service that will take a group photo of my co-workers, identify each of them, and then distribute the photo to their emails.

In Geopandas, Every shape object has methods associated with it to check if they intersect with other shape objects .
In geopandas, look into overlays and spatial joins.
Instead of an array, shouldn't that be called a tensor?
An array is just a contiguous block of memory filled with instances of the same type. Numpy `ndarray`s are Python objects containing a pointer to an array, together with information on how to index it. This is what implements the “dimensions”. Vector and matrix are terms from linear algebra that are somewhat crudely applied to mean arrays with 1-D and 2-D indexing and an additional set of mathematical operations. For example, in Numpy, a `matrix` is a 2D `ndarray` with the product operator defined to align with the matrix product instead of the element-wise Hadamard product used for other arrays.
 The `ndarray`s are all just a flat array, with the pointer contained in a struct that also has information on dimensions and indexing.

Hi! I had the same idea. I love the Monty Hall game and it was my third Python program. Learning Python as well! &amp;#x200B; First, I started off with **data storage**. Essentially, figuring out how I could store the doors and their states (whether it was a goat or car, revealed to the contestant, and selected by the contestant). I decided to store my data in a **list** with three values, ranging from 0-5: &gt;0 = unrevealed goat &gt; &gt;1 = unrevealed car &gt; &gt;2 = chosen goat &gt; &gt;3 = chosen car &gt; &gt;4 = revealed goat &gt; &gt;5 = revealed car Starting off with three doors, all with goats: `doors = [0,0,0]` Randomly changing one door to be a car: `doors[random.randint(0,2)] = 1` This allowed me to easily change between their states later. For example, if the contestant chose a door containing a goat (0) or car (1), I could simply add 2 to the value to change it to a chosen goat (2) or car (3), allowing me to retain what it contains. &amp;#x200B; Next, I defined a couple **functions** in parts so I could call them later, using `def function():` &gt;Displaying the doors. Emojis work! For example, `if doors[i] == 0: print('🐐', end='')` &gt; &gt;Revealing a goat. For this, I brute forced it and had a random number generated and checked if goat/car. If goat, it would be revealed. If car, a new number would be chosen. I could call these functions in later code, making the later code easier to read. &amp;#x200B; Finally, I wrote the **main code**. This involved a lot of inputs (such as `input = input('Pick a door: ')`) and changing the values in the original list (`doors[input] += 2`). I also had a win indicator initialized at the beginning (`win = 0`) and used it at the end to print a congratulatory message if the contestant won (`if doors.count[3]: print('Congratulations, you won a car!'`). &amp;#x200B; This was definitely a bit more complicated for a third Python program, since I was coming from some background in Java before switching over to Python. Let me know if you have any questions or if you'd like to take a look at my code!

In order to improve this image: - “array” is never specifically 3D. in python land, “array” mostly means `numpy.ndarray` which doesn't have a fixed dimensionality. in c land, it's 1D. Therefore array should be above all of vector, matrix, 3D-array, and an ellipsis signifying more dimensions - lists can also contain other data types, e.g. individual numbers or strings (scalars). the heterogeneity of data frames should be reflected in the depiction of lists as well. Then again, it's mostly bad style to have all kinds of objects in a list. In my code, heterogeneous collections of individual objects are usually `typing.NamedTuple`s or data classes.
What do your program look like? Does it have a GUI, that you need to move to HTML? If not, do you need to create some sort of graphical interface? And how about code execution? An easy way to get Python embedded into HTML is to use [Transcrypt](http://transcrypt.org/) tocompile the python code into javascript, and embed it into a HTML page. If that doesn't float your teachers boat, then look into a simple web framework like Pyramid or Flask. 
This picture sucks but does anyone have any images that don’t suck?
python doesnt run on web my friend, so you have two options. easy one - either precompile your python program to javascript, as other user already marked, or learn javascript and program the whole thing again in js hard but cool - if you want to spend some jours learning about HTTP (im assuming you dont know much), you can make it as a multiplayer online game, using python for the server and js for the web note that when I say javascript, im ovbiously talking about html, javascript, and if you want css
