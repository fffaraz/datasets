Hey, I third-fourth-ed Sentdex as well. But now that I'm here let me shamelessly self-promote my videos on data science/engineering with python: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPb2L7gy8Rbr56JfoHrBEHQ?view_as=subscriber Hopefully, some folks will find these videos helpful/interesting!
You’re right about the goal node; I could have thought of a better example perhaps for why it might be slow to evaluate the heuristic. Point that the guy you replied to I think was trying to make was that evaluating a heuristic might not be worth the extra cpu cycles. Anyways, I think this discussion was of basically no utility to anyone, so I’ll stop it here.
he also live streamed him solving advent of code 2018, which were really helpful.
I never had a message from a bot about this. But I'll bear in mind your suggestion for next time.
That's actually pretty funny
&gt;Sentdex &gt;Underrated One of these things are not like the other.
I really enjoy the dry humor. Make the subject more engaging.
I was all ready to go 'Oh jeez, another self promo', but these are actually quite good. Keep it up.

Bucky ?
Will check out.
One of my faves. She goes pretty quickly, in a good way, and by checking the dir / help, in almost all her videos, got me into the same practice. Also, a second for the humor and science-fi references.
Yeah I’ve begun construction on it :)
I’ve never done programming before. This is my first ever trying to program something that makes sense. I’m in a Network Administrator program. We are required one programming course and I’m now taking it. I tried doing Linux last semester but the book was horribly written so I didn’t understand it.
It was a Linux class we were supposed to write scripts in bash. I hated it. Couldn’t understand it. Book was horribly written so I gave up.
Corey Schafer!!
seems like a real missed opportunity
..
Bash is not a good way to learn programming. Bash is good for automating system administration. Each language has strengths and weaknesses.
Yup. He shows up with almost any search related to python... definitely not underrated.
[24” Pythons](https://youtu.be/fKJDAVvs_JA)
Yeah, I learned so much about python from watching those
ha yea I hear you, thanks for the comment!
Your code formatting is bad, but that doesn't matter as you need to read the sidebar over there on the right side of your screen (assuming a desktop web browser). (in other words you need to go to /r/learnpython)
Why is he so good? It's incredible. People should just model all AI teachers on him and everything will be perfect in the world.
Clever Programmer
He reminds me of Khan Academy (Sal) but for computer programming. Explains everything clearly and simply. He translates intimidating concepts into plain english.
I would say he is highly overrated, in my opinion. He has some good stuff but not a channel I was too pleased with after a while.
Code Bullet
I have several monitors and have never had an issue with font rendering in any of the JB apps (PyCharm, GoLand, Rider, etc). I use VSCode for small and quick things, or things which like Terraform HCL code, but much prefer the JB products for their intended languages. It doesn't have things like automatic virtual environment setup or more advanced and useful things that I know of, at least. Even if it did though, I still much prefer PyCharm. VSCodes git support is pretty basic from my bit of use of it. You get a pane that shows a list of files that were changed and a text box at the top for you to put in a comment. You hit stage, commit, then push. That is all I ever really do with it though. From a visual point of view, JB products have much more indepth tooling.
You don't *have* to pay unless you use it commercially. It's free to use for non-commercial use. You lose a few features, but still has plenty of the core features in free mode.

Thank you, currently playing it now :). Sorry for the long reply.
Haha. Been there. Even so, this a nice visualisation and generated a healthy discussion. A* would definitely be cool to see how much it improves.
Thanks for the share! I have Zelle's book but it has collected dust for about 3 years! I am motivated to go through it again now after looking at that website.

Thank you again! I figured out my problem and looping is exactly what I needed to learn. This is literally day 2 with any programming language, so I really need to learn patience. Looping was my very next lesson.
I like working through the problems on my own... but like it that there is an answer if I get really stuck :)
Thank you so much for your series. But I would love you to teach something from core python topics just for some change from data science lectures. This is not to say that I don't like them, I really like your teaching style.

This looks cool. I made something similar that has O(1) lookups. See [ldtable](https://github.com/Jwink3101/ldtable). Do you know what the lookup/query complexity is?
Don’t worry about how it is stored. Worry about how it is presented as a string. You can do this any number of ways: '{:0.2f}'.format(num) '%0.2f' % num f'{num:0.2f}' And there are some others.

Corey Schafer is not underrated. He's literally rated. There is not a single thing but absolute positivity and support people have said about his fantastic channel. I came here just because I knew someone would mention him, but he is not underrated in the slightest.
Absolutely not. This guy's channel is trash.
He's not underrated in the slightest. His channel is fantastic, and everyone knows it.
This PEP severely excites me. Yes, it would be nice to see the performance benchmarking methodology and some real world use, but security &gt; performance. If you're concerned, then restrict it to early in your build/deploy/test process. That might not catch a highly targeted attack using intimate knowledge of your processes, but at least you won't get hit by an en masse backdoor like what is referenced in the PEP.
I started with Bucky on New Boston. He is a great teacher.
What do you mean *so important*? I feel like it's rather uncommon that you use them in python.
This would be better to ask in a social media or Twitter specific forum, because you aren't asking anything related to the Python language or any language really. Ask there, get some suggestions and maybe come back with asks about how we'd suggestion building XYZ app. Just a thought.
QB requires single user mode to make admin changes.

Great channel, but doesn’t he hate python?
Why though?
This is my friend's [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/FixingTinyTediousThings), he is working on a python course, you will see it up by next month. Keep an eye guys!
Who the hell is Bucky?

I wouldn't say he hates it, he hates the way it does some things and is weirded out by the fact that PYTHON IS SUPERIOR AND WE DON'T NEED SEMICOLONS
&gt; when they could just iterate over the objects directly, no indices needed. c++ has several for-each methods std::vector&lt;int&gt; v = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5} for (auto i : v) // access by value, the type of i is int std::cout &lt;&lt; i &lt;&lt; ' '; . int a[] = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}; for (int n : a) // ... print n . std::vector&lt;int&gt; nums{3, 4, 2, 8, 15, 267}; auto print = [](const int&amp; n) { std::cout &lt;&lt; " " &lt;&lt; n; }; std::for_each(nums.begin(), nums.end(), print);
just another leftist maggot who thinks "minorities" are his chattel slaves
I believe list comprehensions and normal loops (for just side effects) are more pythonic than map/filter.
Often use of map and filter will be replaced by generator expressions, and materialised in to lists with list comprehensions. I think map and filter are a little faster than using generator expressions and comprehensions. I use functional programming in my job as a python developer. I avoid using mutation in everything I can. When I first started trying to remove mutable state, some things I did were not functional, they were just complicated contortions of too much crammed in to too small a space. Nowadays, code I'm writing appears to be very simple, with abstraction through simple composition of
 He may not be underrated. But, I want to take this moment to thank him for bringing me back into python world. I was wandering around and his videos were an amazing place to start afresh. I completed 2 of my flask mini projects based on his flask tutorials. Corey Schafer, I want to give this complete credit to you. Thank you for the wonderful work you do.

&gt;diversity of thought &gt; &gt; COMES from unique experiences that other races, genders and sexual orientation have LIVED through that white, cis-gendered heterosexual males have not. &amp;#x200B; That's nonsense. &amp;#x200B; You are \*literally\* saying that a White Russian from Moscow with a background in Computer Science and a White American from Steadam Oklahoma have more in common than a Asian "queer" who grew up in Seattle has with his neighbor who happens to be white. &amp;#x200B; You need to get out and see the world. I've lived--and worked--on three continents in the last 10 years. I can tell you from personal experience that an Australian of European descent raised in the Outback has a MUCH MUCH different experience than their third or fourth cousin living in the south of England. &amp;#x200B; You should join the military and actual spend time with people from a variety of backgrounds regardless of their skin color. &amp;#x200B; I had a guy in my unit from the Florida swamps.

I \*literally\* had nothing in common with the farm boy from Wyoming other than the color of our skin and the uniform we wore. &amp;#x200B; I will agree that diversity of thought and background can bring better solutions, but ONLY when those people are selected on merit \*FIRST\*. &amp;#x200B; Judging someone's "experiences" by the color of their skin or their sexuality is the sort of bullshit bigotry one expects from progressives today.

Both **map** and **filter** are perfectly Pythonic, that’s why they’re builtin functions. They’ve got a lot of overlap with generator comprehensions, certainly, but those came to the language much later. And if you have to apply a function to a filtered iterator the **filter** / **map** form is shorter than the comprehension... much more so if you’re doing a whole pipeline of transformations.
cs dojo
What would improve his channel, in your opinion?
That’s a bit of a circular question... **map** and **reduce** / **fold** (and to a slightly lesser extent **filter**) are fundamental primitives of functional programming as a paradigm... you can’t divorce them from FP, you can just rename them or provide some syntactic sugar around them. So since they’re fundamental to FP they’re necessarily fundamental to FP in Python. _Why_ they’re fundamental to FP is a bigger question; without them how would you transform a domain of inputs into a codomain of outputs via pure functions? With those two primitives you can recreate every list method... really you can do that with just **reduce**, though **map** is much prettier.

&gt; am keen on learning Python, but wish to do so with the aim to develop a music synthesis application (desktop) in mind. &gt; &gt;I have found jythonmusic.me and it is very interesting for what I wish to achieve, but the fact that it is jython based and not cpython is a bit of a put-off. I wish to learn pure python, if possible. Wondering if there are libraries, that offer a high-level abstraction to deal with musical elements -- notes, key, scale, chords, instruments, channels/tracks, tempo, bars etc., programmatically in python ? They may well work with MIDI as underlying technology that then used with a software synthesizer or external hardware synthesizer -- may be used to generate polyphonic, multi-timbral music ? Idea would be to avoid using very low-level sound generation constructs if possible. Ideally a library that is pretty efficient, well documented, has samples/tutorials and has decent community support behind it ? I know, I'm probably asking for a lot, but I'd consider all alternatives. Thanks again @\_redmist. music21 is quite a find! Thanks for the tip-off. It seems to be very very well aligned with what I was hoping to find. At a first glance, i.e. looking at the API -- I thought that it is only for music analysis and study, not for music generation, but reading a bit more looks like one could use it to also generate music (though it seems to be sort of later plumbed-in extension -- main goal still being, way to study existing music). This definitely deserves more time.

&gt; Python has no JIT and it's often orders of magnitude slower than JS's V8 interpreter That's not been true for a long time. PyPy is one Python JIT compiler. JS's V8 is a JIT compiler, not just an interpreter. JIT compilers for both JS and Python are far faster than their interpreters. JS's V8 should be compared to PyPy if you want a fair comparison.
&gt; PyInstaller PyInstaller is for bundling the Python program and all dependencies into a single executable. I do not think it is the usual way to distribute Python programs, especially not relatively simple ones that have presumably few fringe dependencies (i.e. your imported packages are not at risk of being depreciated).

The problem of the orbit not returning to the starting position happens when using Euler's method to solve the differential equations. Something like RK4 does not have such a big problem with growing errors. Check this out: [http://codeflow.org/entries/2010/aug/28/integration-by-example-euler-vs-verlet-vs-runge-kutta/](http://codeflow.org/entries/2010/aug/28/integration-by-example-euler-vs-verlet-vs-runge-kutta/)
The function make_incrementor returns lambda. So “f” it is function. When you call f(0) variable n takes value from parent scope (using closure), and x you pass with param.
Thanks, I will look into it!
I don't know I haven't watched him in like a year. From memory, he moved really fast and skipped over some concepts and kind of brushed over them.
I wish there were a shorter syntax, more like rust’s, but I don’t think it’s any more “Pythonic”, probably less so... I haven’t really seen any anonymous function form that’s markedly better, though.
Oh.. I got it now.. Thank you 😊😊
I actually wish Python had *more* functional programming primitives. I’ve needed an unfold more than a few times.
Even the Java lambda syntax is better and they don't even really have the semantics to support lambdas.
Convert each sentence to its own mp3 file. Then look at the length of the mp3. Walla
I’ll readily admit I’m no Java guy, but based on a quick look, what’s fundamentally better about this: () -&gt; System.out.println("Thing"); ... over this: lambda : print(“thing”) ? Or how is: (a, b) -&gt; a + b; ... markedly an improvement over: lambda a, b: a + b ? Other than handling block syntax (which Python answers with a nested **def**), what’s it offer that I haven’t seen?
Oh yeah Python could do _loads_ more to support FP, but without rewriting the stack management and finding a way to maintain a RecursionLimit for OOP-style code but somehow do tail call elimination for FP-style code, I’m not sure how far they need to go with it inside Python itself. I’m assuming you’ve seen [Coconut](http://coconut-lang.org/)?

Can agree, Flask is the best one to use. It's great for removing all he stuff you don't need. You can even just push out html in the code if you so wish.

40+ here, no issue with learning at 37. Yes I'm sure some companies want that fresh faced Uni leaver. You have the maturity and the proof that you can re learn at 37, which shows you are not stuck in what you already know and are willing to learn new skills. Learning Python got me back into development when I was around your age and I ended up writing a web based VoIP recording platform for my current company. Python is so versatile and should help you in many tasks.

Yes, and there is one administrator who only ever comes in to do those single user mode tasks after hours or on the weekends. That's not the problem.

&gt; A LOT of video editors aren't programmers, I imagine most - yet they *never ever even once considered this*. This seems a bit much, it's more likely that they weren't interested in supporting your use case, or at least didn't have the resources to devote to installation guides. For what it's worth, from a quick glance it looks like the dependencies of these scripts should be fairly straightforward to install even on Windows. Strictly you probably don't need to know any Python to get it working (assuming the scripts do actually work), but you would need to set up a python environment and install some dependencies, so it would help to go through some basic python tutorials. It looks like you can download the scripts themselves [from Github](https://github.com/mikrosimage/ColorPipe-tools), but they aren't distributed as an installable python package, so you'd have to download everything and run the scripts from the right folder. This also isn't hard, but again it will help to have a little python knowledge. /r/learnpython is a good place to ask for help along the way, if you want to try it.
I came across this youtube channel "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2HIN53hM4_ZW8IdmWrJGtw" - pylenin and found his videos on the point and fairly good. I've done a udacity course where I studied python and his teaching methods are as good as any leading teacher of the language.
From context, I surmise it indicates the position of some particle.
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2HIN53hM4_ZW8IdmWrJGtw
An oop approach could work here
Correct. I plan on making the particle darker with increasing mass and more redish, the faster it is moving
what do you mean by that?
I used to recommend Corey Schafer all the time on these types of threads, but I think the word has clearly spread about him. The next \*actually\* underrated youtuber is \[Tech with Tim\]([https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4JX40jDee\_tINbkjycV4Sg](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4JX40jDee_tINbkjycV4Sg)) Not only does he have a lot of high quality tutorials coming out, he streams for pretty long stints and he's quite good at it.

I don't know how are you creating the particle, but maybe you can create a Class called "particle" and give it a mass and a function to interact with the mass of other particles.
Thanks for the feedback, wish it was a little more detailed. No matter what I do, people will simultaneously complain a tutorial is too fast and way too slow and belaboring on the basics. I'm not sure I've yet earned the highly overrated tag, but I'm not one to call myself underrated.
This guy (Python Programmer) [https://www.youtube.com/user/consumerchampion] He has a big collection of free resources for learning Data science with Python.
Of course, as the developer, I'd love to plug my own work. But as somewhat of a beginner getting into programming and working on learning as many languages as possible, one of my first projects I made with Python was [Fuzzle](https://github.com/Dan6erbond/Fuzzle)! Maybe you like it? It's a search engine that may not be anything special, but it works fairly well, isn't the slowest around and is very well to adapt into your own projects, especially web-related stuff since there's both a Python and JavaScript version of it! In addition I'm planning on releasing a Kotlin/C# version for other use-cases.
/r/LearnPython, but you most likely do not need to use loops with numpy arrays.
SoloLearn (Android app and website) was quite helpful for me.
The second edition of his book just came out.
Not exactly a channel, but my favorite Python-related video ever is [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e08kOj2kISU).

you'r'e kind of proving my point; variety of experiences is a GOOD THING. Also, I'm not talking about HIRING; I'm talking about training and mentoring and giving opportunities to those who OTHERWISE would not have the opportunity. And yeah, white males can have VASTLY different experiences, as you've noted; this is great! Let's see if we can't channel that uniqueness into providing opportunity.
It happens when you don't use a symplectic integrator. You can use something simple like [semi-implicit euler integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-implicit_Euler_method) to get much better results.Runge-Kutta is not a symplectic integrator, so you will have the same problem.

You're my hero. Starred and looking.
I like where this is going, keep it up

What modules are you using for this?
Thank you!!
Numpy and PIL
Oh I love this! My final project for a computational astrophysics class was to build an orbit simulator and then sample different orbits to build the famous [porkchop plot](https://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/spotlight/porkchopAll.html). I have very little formal training in python, but this was an amazing project that taught me so much, even if the finished product wasn’t as fleshed out as I initially hoped. I see someone here mentioned RK4 sampling; it sounds intimidating but was actually really simple to implement. I won’t dox myself by linking my GitHub (has my real name and contact info for professional reasons), but feel free to message me and I can share my code! This is such a cool project and I really hope you keep working on it!
David Beazley, perhaps a little more advanced but usually blows my mind at least once per video. Usually they are conference talks from PyCon or PyData
Interesting project, though I wish the title was more accurate and less clickbate. This is not, a wrapper for any API. It's a framework to simplify API wrapper creation.
you know what I never thought about that you are right I'm changing description (atleast on github). Thank you for attention!
changed it to "AnyAPI is a library that helps you to write any API wrappers with ease and in pythonic way."
Very Cool!
man, you're truly amazing, thx for keeping all that good stuff out there for all of us. I've learnt a lot from you
You should check out leapfrog too. It's easier to impliment and better for classical gravity solvers
Oop= object oriented programming
I hope you get an answer from more experienced users in these matters. Try writing your own post to this sub. I've just dipped my toes into web-dev. I've interacted with flask, and moving towards Django. Check this link out: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9081123/is-django-for-the-frontend-or-backend I do believe that the greatest difficulty people face when learning something new is that they try to just learn how to code without having a goal in mind. What I found extremly useful was working through a tutorial which in the end would get me to a project that I was interested in, or really enjoyed.
Try vpython! It's what's usually used for intro physics students doing these Sims, and you can make 3D simulations!
I so much hoped it would draw a penis. Missed opportunity..
I'm an old school, I use virtualenv package to create my virtual environment. As to store the environments, I create a root directory called PythonV, and all the environments are stored under PythonV directory. Try to avoid create your virtual environments in multiple places since if you use IDE like VS Code or Sublime Text, you will have to keep changing the directory path if you want to switch gears. If you are saving all your virtual environments under the same root folders, VS Code and Sublime Text will recognize all the virtual environments under that root folder.
r/learnpython?
That's a good suggestion, in that the symplectic euler method should conserve the energy of the system, but being a first-order integrator one would still expect it to have much higher error than RK4, even if the latter does not conserve energy.
For strings, always quotes. Also, r/learnpython is a better sub for learning questions
&gt; do we have to use quotes in the parenthesis while writing a value? No. Why do you think you might? Can you give an example of code where you do have to use quotes? Are you aware of the difference between *strings*, other values, variables and so forth?
nope + r/learnpython
Of course it is possible. But what does it have to do with Python? Is it a good idea? No, no, a thousand times no. "Greying out" user interface elements has meant that the UI element is disabled for well over 30 years. Despite a (horrible, bad, hard-to-use) fashion for grey-on-grey colour schemes among some designers, you should use "greying out" to mean "this button is no longer enabled and cannot be clicked". As a learning exercise, sure, go for it. Just please don't use it in a real application as an interface, unless you want to annoy, frustrate and confuse your users.
Thanks, this is awesome! Just installed it on my system and love it already.
Bad bot.
Read some books: Fluent Python -- really good Serious Python -- just started but it's good Effective Python -- heard good things about Hitchhikers Guide to Python -- read online version High Performance Python -- looked interesting There aren't many choice book wise regarding advanced Python programming. Read the source of some open source programs, Hitchhikers Guide to Python has some recommendations. Learn some JavaScript so you can build a frontend to a Python backend. Do some coding challenges like cryptopals or Project Euler. Build a game in pygame, learn about deep learning and reinforcement learning and get a AI to play the game you made.
I just recently did the 23andMe ancestry report, so depending on what they do with my DNA behind closed doors I guess clones aren't entirely out of the question...
Just made a change that may be of interest to others. Here is the new [Demo Program](https://github.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI/blob/master/DemoPrograms/Demo_Debugger_Integration.py), a modification of the one listed in this post. The new version starts with the debugger "off". If you want to bring up and use the debugger, there's a button in the app window to bring it up. This will allow you to launch and close the debugger at will while your program continues to run as normal.

Lichess is open source right? I believe the source code is up somewhere
I personally prefer virtualenwrapper over the bare virtualenv. First if all, I used to create virtual environments in the root for of the project too, but then it can get tricky to manage in that's also a git repository. Do you use the project name, or something like venv or .venv, to name your environment, so that you can put it in the ignore file? Then you're forcing collaborators to use that name for their environments. With virtualenwrapper, all environments are created in your home for (I believe in .virtualenvs), you can list them, destroy them, or create new, from everywhere. As for the name to use, I often use the same name of the project too!
&gt; &gt; A LOT of video editors aren't programmers, I imagine most - yet they never ever even once considered this. &gt; &gt; This seems a bit much, it's more likely that they weren't interested in supporting your use case Is that supposed to be *better*? Intentional neglect ("screw the video editors who aren't programmers") rather than accidental ("all video editors can program, right?").
Unfortunately, this is a real problem with software. It is especially a big problem with Open Source, for many reasons, but it applies across the board from super-expensive proprietary software to freeware and everything in between. I like to describe this as ["And now you have muffins!"](https://northernplanets.blogspot.com/2007/11/internet-tutorials.html) syndrome. It is an aspect of the [Curse of Knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_knowledge) so as annoying and indeed as obnoxious as it can be, don't take it personally.
I had never heard of him so I'm glad he was mentioned.
I think he means that you have an image on the button and then while you hover over the image it greys out, but as you mouse away it recolourises again?
Back in the day I'd just name them after the projects or repo name. Just made associating them easier. Consider These days, I prefer to work with containers with Docker and Docker Compose and avoid project-specific virtual environments. Since most of my deployment targets are containerized environments anyway, this works out great. I do still have a few virtualenvs my system that mostly function as scratchpad/utility environments that aren't terribly important that I "manage" with virtualenvwrapper but they're not terribly important and exist as a convenience factor.

Cheers , I will look into it
For a gravity solver conservation of energy is much more important though. With the semi-implicit euler method the system is stable, with RK4 you either get an inspiral or the two bodies drift of. You can also use higher order symplectic integrators like verlet etc., but the semi-implicit euler method is just the easiest to use.
This is in fact what I mean. &amp;#x200B; Ive been trying a few things, each to no avail. Everything I am doing is for learning and experience purposes. I have made a class button that would change the activebackground on mouseover which worked well enough so now I am attempting to take it a step further. I have built a GUI that contains 9 frames inside it (3x3 grid formation) and those 9 frames have 9 buttons inside. These buttons each have an individual background image. I wish for these to initially show as "greyed out" then 'colourise' (if you will) on mouseover.
Solarsim.net
hmmm, firstly I would test out greyscalling on demand with Pillow, then test out mouse positioning on the screen and you can map the coordinates of the mouse to the different boxes and have a loop of when the mouse going into the certain coordinates, it calls the function to greyscale the image. Maybe [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3698635/getting-cursor-position-in-python) could be useful to you?
Turn that around! Be happy that you dont know things. Approach situations with the mindset that your knowledge is limited. Be eager to learn something new every day. A bad software developer is one that knows everything.
Or worse, thinks they know everything, while knowing a lot less. Opportunities to learn are great.
You should check out this course. https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6aFlwukCmDf0-1-uSR7mklK While it isn't for Python you can still learn a lot from it. I'm following it with HTML canvas right now. If you're interested in making simulations on a 2d canvas I recommend you watch it.
&gt; Is that supposed to be better? Sure, it respects the fact that all the author(s) really did is write some code and post it online. In fact, they went further by making it easily available to others and writing some documentation for it - that's amazing! But the fact that they put in that effort in no way obliges them to support any particular use case. That said, it's vastly more likely that they ran out of time or interest than that they actively tried to restrict use of their tool to programmers. But even if they actively decided to devote the resources they did have to other things, that's completely fine.
The field were in is ever changing. Knowing things is not enough. What's important is the ability to learn and be taught as well as a desire to learn.
this is sound advice, its not something that will hold me back - I love learning it wont stop me, but just wondering if everyone else has that feeling...
Yes of course. I had that feeling until I got a mentor and my first job. Our engineer works very close with me. Were always talking about new tech, better practices, etc.
Most of stuff I already done in reards to this program is in python, so I was hoping to find a answer to do this in python.
The more often you solve a problem, the more confident you'll get at confidently thinking "I'll figure this out." After 20 years I still find problems all the time that I struggle with but at this point I have much more experience eventually solving them than experience giving up.

Find something you want to build, whether due to some perceived need, or for fun. Build it. When you get stuck research solutions, implement those solutions, and fix any bugs you find in your code. &amp;#x200B; As /u/zlasre suggested, there are some good books as well.
The sidebar has a lot of useful stuff here, [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com) does a good job at introducing more advanced concepts. A better look into the more computer science side of things is also something you could look at. [Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures using Python](http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/pythonds/index.html) does a good job at introducing graph theory, along with sort and search algorithms.
Don't be an arse. For centuries, men had virtually all the power, status and money, and today they still have the lions share of it. If you want equality, that means equal shares in power, status and money, not "men have the good jobs, the money, the power, the high status, and women will take the shit ones, that's equal, right?" What did you think equality means if it doesn't mean, you know, **equal**? Even today, women are already well over represented in the low status, low-paid, chronically harmful jobs^1. Taking on more shit jobs while leaving high status well-paid jobs to men isn't equality. &gt; This is, of course, absurd, unless you're a Communist. Well done, you've just demonstrated an appalling level of ignorance that beats even your earlier pig-ignorant comment about "Marxists". Please, do explain more of your philosophy to me, I could do with a laugh. &gt; long, and hard. Deary deary me, another sad little man making a sad little penis reference. Sounds like somebody is compensating for something. ^1 Usually jobs like cleaning and assembly line work, which are often repetitive and lead to long-term *chronic* injuries, sometimes debilitating ones. As opposed to *acutely* dangerous work, which is often high-skill, high-status and well-paid, like fire-fighting and soldiering, where there may be a significant risk of sudden injury or death but the compensation and status is usually proportional to the risk.
I know what the description means. So using the convention which has been standard for most popular GUIs for thirty years, that means that moving the mouse over the button disables it, and moving the mouse away enables it again. Whether you *actually* disable/enable the button is irrelevant, you're still signalling "this is disabled". Hence the confusion and annoyance. As I said, if the OP wants to do it as an exercise, go for it. As an exercise, or a joke (like those practical joke apps where the buttons move out of the way of the mouse and you have to chase them around the screen) it sounds fun. Just don't put it into production.
&gt; you'r'e kind of proving my point; variety of experiences is a GOOD THING. Nobody has every said it wasn't. What people are objecting to is enshrining \*diversity\* over \*competence\*. And this \*IS\* happening. &amp;#x200B; What people are starting to notice is that some White Americans have a fetish for "diversity", but other minorities groups have a preference for people who look and sound like them. &amp;#x200B; What people are starting to notice is that \*some\* American's preference for "diversity" is skin deep. That they want rainbows where every color thinks alike along certain axis. Look at what happened to Brandon Eich--there is ZERO evidence he EVER discriminated against anyone on any basis, but he got run out of Mozilla just because he donated money in support of Prop 8. Look at what happened to James Damore. He \*followed the science\* (such as it is in sociology) and got fired for talking about it. There's another Google Engineer who's written an essay up on Medium (at least it was for a while) who's been repeatedly been reported for creating a hostile work environment simply for disagreeing with someone in a protected minority class. &amp;#x200B; Most of us have no problem with hiring the best people for the job. What we object to is basing "best" on the color of their skin or their genitalia.
Security &gt; performance only when it doesn't hurt the default case. I don't care about when hooks are added. But in the unavoidable case when you don't have hooks there is a performance hit. That's what I'm worried about. I am *especially* worried about it because that 1.05x performance hit seems to be on microbenchmarks on the unavoidable case. The implementation is ridiculous. The relevant hook caller could have easily been implemented as an optional (default off, since 99/100 times people do *not* have security audit hooks) argument to the python process, which if that argument is enabled, turn on the hook caller.
Any decent GUI framework will have a MouseOver event or equivalent. The OP u/Oldogstyle probably wants to change the button's image state on MouseEnter and MouseExit, or whatever the GUI framework provides. Mapping the mouse coordinates to the images by hand doesn't sound like the right way to do it. Firstly, you're re-inventing the wheel: the framework almost certainly knows which button or image the mouse is over. Secondly, doing it in pure Python is likely to be slow.
really dude
&gt; I have built a GUI Is the GUI framework or library you are using a secret? You might get better answers if you tell us which framework you have used (tkinter, wxPython, SimpleGUI, etc).

Functions is what you're looking for.
You aren't happening to be doing this to represent money, are you? Floats and money make for bad times. See: Office Space
With two bodies, if you conserve energy the only way you can go wrong is precession and (de)circularization, which aren't as bad as in/outspiral, but elsewhere OP mentioned wanted to do a lot of particles and it is less obvious to me that conservation of energy will help significantly there, whereas a first-order vs fourth-order method will definitely make a big difference in error. I'm not sure how to understand the stability of the two methods when simulating lots of particles, as the actual system being simulated is itself chaotic and unstable. As I recall with 3 bodies you can get chaotic behavior and with 5 bodies you can send one of them off to infinity in finite time (although that might require 3 dimensions?).
You **cannot** define custom _keywords_, you **can** define custom _functions_: def say(thing): print(thing) say(“Hello”) Though you can also give a new name to an existing function: say = print say(“Hello”) Though that only works in Python 3, as previously **print** was actually a keyword. And yeah this is best to ask in r/learnpython.
You can't make code 'private' in Python in the same way that you can in other languages.
I quite like this have an upvote
Superb
Even if you have lots of particles, conservation of energy and angular momentum is crucial, this is how a stable system is defined. If you don't conserve energy, particles will either all fall together or drift off to infinity after a while. Using even the semi-implicit euler method you can simulate systems over very long timescales without this happening. If you want to do science then obviously you would go for a higher order integrator, though something like verlet or other symplectic integrators. In this case of a simple n-body simulation for fun semi-implicit euler is more than enough.

No secret, id post the entire code however it doesnt paste over very well. Its all in tkinter as of now. Im open to anything to expand knowledge as this is all just intriguing exercises.
Here the Class I played with to get the mouseover effect i currently have; class HighlightButton(tk.Button): def \_\_init\_\_(self, master, \*\*kw): tk.Button.\_\_init\_\_(self,master=master, \*\*kw, relief='flat') self.defaultBackground = self\["background"\] self.bind("&lt;Enter&gt;", self.on\_enter) self.bind("&lt;Leave&gt;", self.on\_leave) def on\_enter(self, e): self\['background'\] = self\['activebackground'\] def on\_leave(self, e): self\['background'\] = self.defaultBackground &amp;#x200B; All images start as greyed out, trying to make them 'come to life' when you mouseover. Surely the above is heading in the right direction? &amp;#x200B; surely

Hmmm, good point, so although semi-implicit euler might diverge from the correct solution ("micro state") much faster than RK4, by conserving energy its "macro state" should stay accurate longer, and certain degenerate macro states are obviously wrong to the viewer.
Ugh!!! r/gifsthatendtoosoon
[https://andrewdelph.github.io/solar\_sim/](https://andrewdelph.github.io/solar_sim/) the database feature is broken now. but its tore orbits that would last for 15 mins
thank you for your help in Github.
If you want to test the accuracy of your algorithm or even improve the accuracy, check to see if momentum of the system remains constant through the simulation.
Sugoi desu nee
Correct URL: https://www.humblebundle.com/books/artificial-intelligence-deep-learning-books
While I'm impressed at the output, I also have no way of knowing how accurate this is.
Energy is conserved, but not momentum. At the start when the dots are not moving there is zero momentum and builds.
Thanks! I'll try 'em
Who'd guess a few dots can be so entertaining :) good job!
Thank you :)
Momentum should be conserved also. If the system starts at zero momentum, it should stay at zero. Positive momentum will be cancelled out by negative momentum as the velocity of the particles increases.
What notebook you been using? What's your fav?
I am using Jupyter notebook since its the only one I know xD
Working on sharing an endless loop running on a single server with multiple clients that are each running a Tkinter gui to visualize incoming data, WITHOUT any blocking.
How about continuity? I’m a little rusty here but if your momentum is being conserved that doesn’t necessarily imply that your mass is also being conserved. If continuity is conserved here may I suggest showing that where the “dots” increase in size accordingly? Also, have an upvote!
Well, momentum is mass \* velocity. If you do the math and want mass to stay constant you get the velocity after the colission with v = (p1.mass \* p1.velocity + p2.mass \* p2.velocity)/(p1.mass + p2.velocity) But you are right, thats the next thing I will be working on. Changing the size based on mass
Codebasics
The dots are never not moving
I think you got it mixed up. Momentum stays constant in an inelastic collision but energy is lost in it. Also the energy always changes from potential to kinetic
Great man, have an upvote
Thanks for the advice!
Total momentum is conserved if there are no external forces. This is a direct consequence of the symmetry of the energy of the system with respect to special translation of the whole system. The conservation of energy is a similar thing but the relevant symmetry is the time translation one
Be cool if the colliding masses grew in size directly increasing their total gravitational pull on other objects. But that's just a thought
Same, did you use a library for the equations?
They infact are increasing their pull. I just haven't got around to doing it
numpy for the calculations with vectors and PIL for visualizing the pictures
Couldnt have said it better. An upvote to you three
Gravity is an additional force in this simulation my dude.
Momentum doesn't change due to collisions true. the momentum immediately before the collision should equal the momentum immediately after but I do mean immediately otherwise the gravity changes your numbers.
They are speeding up and slowing down due to gravity.
Couldnt have said it better. An upvote to you four
Agreed
Are you trying to save the Quadrisolarans?
Couldnt have said it better. An upvote to you five
Practice on Codewars.com or leetcode
Both energy and momentum are conserved, since their isn’t any sound or heat loss
Wouldn’t you believe there was a new bug as I was making the release? It’s kind of like hurry up and get me an example or you’re probably waiting a year for it to be an official version. So I woke up to what I needed, made the fix in 20 minutes with a test, found more documentation bugs (Sphinx doesn’t crash when it can’t process at Jupyter notebook rst files, so it skips the block), and finally got around to announcing it Friday. It’s always another week, so it takes a month to do a release.
Are you calculating the interaction particle by particle? If you like an additional challenge, look into the particle-in-cell method. It's usually used to solve problems involving a very large (&gt;10e4) ensemble of particles under the influence of electromagnetic interactions, but it can be just as well be used to solve gravitational systems for a large amount of massive bodies. You could, for example, make galaxy simulations.
Like fractions? You should add some examples.
Like fractions yeah but not quite. Where would you like to see examples? On the README.md? Or now?
I’d put it in the readme and probably here just so people know what your code can do.

This is so cool. I’ve been thinking about doing some n-body problem stuff after watching the first couple of [3Blue1Brown videos on differential equations](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=p_di4Zn4wz4). I will have to dig up my Astrodynamics textbook and play around with this idea. I feel like it’s all just a result of Conservation of Angular Momentum and Newton’s Law of Gravitation using some numerical integration.
Can do. As soon as I take a break from packing I'll add an example in both places. Good call!
I will look into it
&gt;v = (p1.mass \* p1.velocity + p2.mass \* p2.velocity)/(p1.mass + p2.velocity) You mean v = (p1.mass \* p1.velocity + p2.mass \* p2.velocity)/(p1.mass + p2.**mass**) in order for the units to work out, I assume?
oh yes, sorry
Cool.
Hi /u/mitra1789, I was going through this tutorial today and noticed it doesn't accept the user input in section 2, get\_user\_choice( ). I added int( ) around the input and it works now. Otherwise, very helpful, thanks for posting!
But wait energy can be radiated when a collision happens
Do you need to use the cloud? There are plenty of python (or at least python-callable) programs on the desktop that can do it.
Can you link to the repo?
Since it has not been mentioned yet: [decimal module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/decimal.html) in stdlib.
If you made it so that a new dot appeared every time two combined it would make a dope screensaver
Great Idea
Is this a Symplectic simulation?
Nice. If you are interested in taking this further, you could turn this into a "Big Bang Simulator" of sorts. Create hundreds/thousands of mass points and watch it go. I even saw a video once where someone used the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation to 'tweak' the density of the mass points in certain areas.
Heh you're inelastic, on a side note do the inelastic collisions combine the mass of the point masses?
or read Fluent Python. As far as I'm aware there's nothing that is nearly as good and comprehensive (and reasonably recent)
Edited
Sure, using tkinter you can do what you describe where you have a tkinter canvas on top (where you can draw pictures on) and the bottom can be a multiline text widget to display text. Here's a tiny example: import tkinter class Window(tkinter.Tk): def __init__(self): super().__init__() self.canvas = tkinter.Canvas(width=800, height=400, bg='blue') self.text = tkinter.Text() self.canvas.pack() self.text.pack() # draw something self.canvas.create_rectangle(10,10,790,390,outline='white') self.text.insert(tkinter.END, "Hello there\n") self.text.insert(tkinter.END, "How are you?\n") w = Window() w.mainloop() Programming a gui application is quite different from a console application though (what I assume your current program is)

GitHub?
&gt; always changes from potential to kinetic You can compute both tough. And while it isn't conserved in collisions, energy conservation is a good check for the gravity solver itself and colissions can probably be turned off (commented out etc.).
I just don't understand why people using Python 3 are still using virtualenv when venv is built in and works the same or better.
Matter of opinion I guess but I would rather see python get 1.05x slower so that this feature is possible. But: &gt; Analysis using the Python Performance Benchmark Suite [1] shows no significant impact, with the vast majority of benchmarks showing between 1.05x faster to 1.05x slower. They really need to be more upfront with which benchmarks see what impact. Some are faster? How? Experimental error? Can we trust this statement at all, it certainly isn't useful to me. Would be good to see some benchmarks with simple hooks too. At least one that is simply logging to a text file or something.
can you give source code please?
People just adding +1 just to gain karma.......
The Five Body Problem?
Python shouldn't be a factor.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-multiplication#Rule_of_Three
Thanks. I’m not at all familiar with that sort of thing.
Yeah, once it got down to 2 bodies in a stable configuration the gif should have just kept playing for eternity.
This is exactly what it does but now I wanna create a class that inherits Proportion and calls DoubleProportion by doing a/b/e = c/d/f
Oops. I can't count
Pretty cool!
Except one ball absorbed 3 while the other only 2.
it *looks* like it's dissipative - the final two objects seem to be spiralling in on each other at the end.
Oh yeah, I forgot that you can't have a stable 2-body system if the masses aren't equal.
Sounds like you have your project there; now get coding! Good luck :-)

Anaconda does not add itself to the PATH environmental variable by default, hence why your system is not finding it. You must run it from the folder containing the anaconda binaries (which will be located where anaconda was installed into).

So run it from the anaconda binaries. The PATH environment.
Wow! This reminds me of my old gravity simulation I made in mathematica. The fun part is experimenting with alternative force laws (for instance 1/r, or the modified gravity force law)

I will try to clarify. Your operating system has an "environmental" variable called PATH. This variable contains the list of directories where the operating system will search for programs when it is asked to execute one. For example, you run the command `ls` in a terminal which lists the contents of the current folder. Your OS searches the directories in PATH for a program called `ls`, once found it will run the program and list the contents of the directory. When you try to run `conda` the OS again is searching through the directories in PATH for a program called `conda`. However, it does not get found because the directory containing this program is not in the PATH variable. This default behaviour is by design to prevent anaconda from polluting the system with multiple python installations (Linux systems always come with python installations). Solution 1 (preferred): As a solution you simply have to find where anaconda put `conda` and its other binaries (ie programs) and run said programs from that folder. Solution 2 (not recommended): You could add the path containing `conda` and the other anaconda programs to PATH. However, now when you run `python`, how does the OS know to use the system python or the anaconda python? You may break some programs on your computer.
What is the moon?
Are you using general relativity equations or newton's classic physics?
SEVEN
Definitely curious to see source code
That mostly makes sense: so the PATH directories needs a reference frame it doesn't have. In order to get it to reference it I need to get it to run from that folder. So the question is do I do this from the terminal and how?
Generally speaking to achieve clumping requires some kind of non-gravitational process to shed energy from the system, such as collisions that generate friction. The details are going to depend on what kind of behavior you are trying to achieve (and if you actually want lots of small particles to coalesce into a larger body that moves as a group, you'll have to plan carefully how to perform the computations efficiently). This is part of why dark matter is so different from ordinary matter. It is believed that dark matter only interacts through gravity, so it is unable to form clumps like planets and stars.
I love this. How creative and what a fun project. Good job.

Just use google colab to start and open it in the chrome app. Its a cloud based jupyter notebook. Then all youd need is a keyboard, if you want.
venv was introduced from Python 3.3 and onward, if you are using Python version lower than 3.3 (which a lot of companies do these days), then virtualenv is recommended as it won't break other dependents or system tools. I guess to your point, if a user is using Python 3.3 or newer, than yes, venv should be the preferred method.

You might have [Imposter Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome), which is quite common in our field. I think it arises from consuming too many blog posts or videos or even Reddit posts from people sharing their projects and work, and it makes you feel like everyone is doing awesome things that we can't compete with. The truth is that those people only account for a small percentage of professional programmers. Most professional programmers aren't showing off their work or promoting themselves online. Keep your passion, keep on learning, and don't think too much about what others may be doing. If there's a skill you feel like you're missing, go ahead and try to learn it, but you don't need to know everything to be successful.
Maybe not put the @ in front of py? If you’re trying to run a python file, try doing like python urfilepath, or python3 urfilepath.
tried it, unfortunately, it didnt work, it gives me the same error :( any other suggestions?
Try using r’&lt;your path&gt;’
i'm sorry but can you type out an example, i'm almost brand new with all of this.
Just checked it out that’s really cool thank you!
They are at rest in the beginning.

Honest question: How does this simulate gravity?
Bad bot
Hey, when two planets coalesce, did you account for the fact that the mass has been doubled? Also, can you share the source? It's super cool project.
Sounds like it cannot load the base.png. Double check it is in the folder
Tips on how to do this? Like libs and stuff?
The link on the top of the repo (https://www.piratesrewritten.com) leads to a site with no content FYI.
Imagine each black dot is a body in space
That’s soo cooool
^
Oh, that makes sense. For some reason I was thinking it was some sort of graph. So he must also be simulating momentum since it keeps going, right?
Looks good to me 😎😎😎
You calculate the force on each mass due to the other masses. Then you have acceleration, which you can multiply by a small time increment of your choice to get velocity (acceleration x time = velocity). From there you can determine the distance each dot travels in on time increment. Then repeat to get a cool video 😎
Yeah
Yeah
Very nice! Just an advice though, a requirements.txt file would be nice.
Cool, thanks!
any tutorial on how to get started with something like this?

Looks like you are trying to run a Batch script with the Python interpreter.
What are you trying to accomplish here ? Are you trying to run a Python script using a batch file ?
Yeah I think I have base python at the moment. To use tkinter would I need to download something extra ? Also thanks for the help.
Can you just google it? Why do you post your search query?
I was googling it, but all of results are things that i personally don't see as something that would require new language to learn.
anyone who believes this actually happens outside of physics class has lost the plot
That's Reddit for, br3w0r.
I don’t think that IDLE can be used for writing .bat files. Could it be that what you wrote would cause an error in Python, so IDLE tells you. Use a program like Notepad to write a batch file
In case you missed it, I think this from the official Python site puts it succinctly: &gt;C++ &gt;Almost everything said for Java also applies for C++, just more so: where Python code is typically 3-5 times shorter than equivalent Java code, it is often 5-10 times shorter than equivalent C++ code! Anecdotal evidence suggests that one Python programmer can finish in two months what two C++ programmers can't complete in a year. Python shines as a glue language, used to combine components written in C++. So depending on your use cases it may make sense to use a language that is easier to read, write, and maintain.
Yes!
Wouldn't 1/r Just lead to a scenario in which everything collides since there isn't a escape velocity?
Just Newton
I am familliar with js and few of its extensions like node or react already. Thanks for answer, did you ever made any bigger Python app, if yes, how would you descp Python? Was evrything easy and clear?
What do you mean?
/r/learnpython
My question is not about specific python problem but Python as language.
Well. I used numpy for calculations and PIL for visualization. Each particle is a Object with the Attributes mass, velocity, position and acceleration. Then there are 4 methods (update position, -velocity, -acceleratiom) for example update_position: position = position + velocity*c With c you can regulate the Size of your Timesteps. Then just keep updating them over and over whilst plotting their position
physics book and pyglet for visualization

Nor is your question unique. This is the wrong place to ask it, and this is the wrong way to have it answered. Search the subs for the many, many times this question has been asked and answered before.
You're welcome. I edited out the JS reference from my comment if other people are confused by the thread. I meant to imply I'm not very familiar with Python syntax myself, mostly started "exploring" it just to understand the differences in setting up a dev environment and to see how easily the general programming concepts would cross over. Loops are a thing of beauty. I'm sure others here will chime in, but it looks like an excellent language to pick-up. I'm committed to various JS w/frameworks/Node.js stacks, and do not personally have the compartmentalization ability to separate a lot of similar looking syntax without losing focus. I wish I did, I admire people who can pick-up a lot of languages ,and am just grateful I can use JS on the backend now.
This is actually quite simple. You don't need any libraries for it. I first did this 2 decades ago in 300 LOC in Pascal, running on DOS, with a thousand objects or so. It's not computationally expensive, that's what I'm saying. Using plain old basic Python will work just fine.
General relativity would be a huge overkill given that you lose so much precision when doing discrete steps and not trajectories defined by differential equations (which is prohibitively complicated for anyone to do today)
Funny enough, i know pascal from highschool (yeah we teach pascal here)
This way there will be quite a large mass accumulated quite quickly which would not make sense. Maybe if the rest of the objects "evaporate" some mass to compensate
...I guess it could be just me, but there have been like three times in my life when I've felt genuinely dumb, and number four is now reading the top comments. I'm reading the words, but half the time my brain is just like "error, error...does not compute". And now I'm sad because I just got happy that there's still smart people out there...somewhere. Damn that pen is strong.
Don't worry. I am also confused by some suggestions. Confusion is part of the learning process!
Are these elastic collisions? Can you do them with other Shapes than circles?
They *should* be elastic, however, they are not quite - some energy is lost. I think this is due to floating point errors. &amp;#x200B; I am currently adding Rectangles, but for what I'm making I don't need custom Polygons, so I likely won't add them
Congratulations, you accurately modelled the last few Cheerios in my cereal bowl. Joking aside, I think this is great and makes me want to have a go.

Very cool! Saved for later
This is for my A-level Computer Science coursework, so I'm not sure if I can post the source code online yet. Message me in about 8 months and I'll be done with it and I'll be able to release it publicly

You can run python on a raspberry pi. It costs 25$.

Nope, tkinter comes with Python. (on some Linux distributions you do have to install a separate package, most likely called python-tk or pyton-tkinter)
Native is probably a better option.
Ficking hell, mods, can you ban this shit already?

Didn't realize that those posts weren't that well received either.
These collisions do not preserve energy. But you are correct, an Hamiltonian system would conserve both
That's the gif loading. The initial conditions have velocity
Native is best. Easy to implement. The next worst thing you want is an interpreted language having fuckloads of frameworks on top of frameworks like javascript has become. Keep it silly simple, yet effective.
Bouncy!
Thanks for these and great work on the project.
So this became a bit longer than I anticipated, please excuse the wall of text. Your post just hit a nerve as I was faced with the same question many years ago. Off we go: &amp;#x200B; Which kinds of applications do you create in C++? Which kinds of applications do you want to create, for which platforms? Python is great to interface with all kinds of technology and libraries but not so great at performance out of the box and it is not the right language to program extremely limited micro controllers. I think it is important to also consider the environment and existing libraries, frameworks etc. when talking about a programming language. As a rule of thumb, with Python gain a vastly quicker development turnaround at the cost of performance. That said, there are frameworks for Python for specific niches such as math and science (numpy, scipy, pandas - math and matrix manipulation and charting libraries gradually replacing long-time industry favorites such as Mathematica and R) which are written in faster languages more fitting for the job such as C++ or even with assembler optimizations. TensorFlow for machine learning also comes to mind. Thus, you can have the best of both worlds, an insanely quick development turnaround and great performance where it matters. This is why Python is loved by many startups but also in machine learning, big data and other fields which are very fluid and require quick adaptation to new challenges. People saying Python is a glue language for binding together code written in other languages sounds pessimistic. In reality this is exactly what you do in other languages as well - it is just that the libraries you use are coincidentally written in the same language. * If you write a GUI application in C++, there is a number of frameworks to choose from, such as QT. * If you write a GUI application in Python, there is a number of frameworks to choose from, such as QT... you catch my drift. **Why?** So, some upsides of Python include: Python code is much shorter, more clear, easier to read, write and maintain. Don't believe it? Neither did I. But with 20 lines of Python I can do the same as with 200 lines of C++ previously without having to worry about header files, make files There is a great standard library which follows a "batteries included" approach and contains not only low-level and algorithmic stuff but modules focusing on real-world problems. Want to do HTTP requests, parse CSV files, read a ZIP file, create cryptographic hashes, do simple XML? It is all there, with nice interfaces and great documentation. SQLite3 database support is also baked in. If you want to do more than "pip install" a module and go on your merry way. "requests" for HTTP is a well-liked library, for example. Want to scrape web sites? Take scrapy, beautifulsoup, requests-html. Want to automate a full-blown browser? Python + Selenium is a bliss. Speed in development: I dreaded Python slowness for startup and execution - but in reality, I found out that most things I want to conquer don't require hand-optimized assembler code. Python conquers real-life problems on real-life computers which nowadays are way fast enough to account for the performance hit incurred by the language. This was a difficult one for me to let go. But for accepting the performance hit when running an application, you gain enormous amounts of time while developing a solution. As I become older time is of more importance to me. I cannot buy time. I do not want to spend hours and hours obsessing over a pointer error in some piece of C++ code. I want to live my life and for this I want to get things done quickly. You can crank out a functioning piece of software with a significant amount of functionality in an afternoon. It is truly mind-blowing coming from a language like C++. In fact, I am sure many Python projects stay in the "good enough for me, don't have to polish" phase because it is so insanely fast to get a working result. With C++, it was more of a "dig in your heels" approach for me, overcoming great obstacles to eventually reach a goal. I had a myriad of time-consuming future projects lined up- With Python, the prototype is running within a few hours and I don't even have enough ideas for new projects anymore because everything I want done is done. I like Python idioms. The language has shortcuts of pure beauty for everyday problems. Look at list comprehensions, for-each loops, "enumerate", string slicing for starters. Python has just enough functional programming support to fulfill my needs without forcing me to use it all the time. There is zip, map, filter, lambda functions and more. Reading Python code by good Python developers is a joy. That also applies to other languages but with Python, it is extra true. This starts with the forced line indentation which provides easy understanding of nested code blocks. While in other languages there are may ways to solve a problem, Python strives for a "best", "Pythonic" way to do it. Of course there are more than one way to do a job but code by good programmers will use specific idioms consistently which makes it a joy to read their code and so easy to understand once you grasp the core ideas of how to do something in a "Pythonic" way. It enables you to quicker understand the code and focus on the ideas and problems it solves. There even is a kind of world-wide accepted coding style (PEP8) which most Python programmers adhere to to a large degree. There is a tool called "black" you can use before checking your code into a source code repository that automatically formats your code according to a style accepted by most developers world-wide. There will always be personal preferences but most everybody can live with it, given the upside of a common style everybody knows and understands instantly. No meaningless coding style wars over curly braces anymore, ever, period. There is a great developer community. You find answers to most of your questions with a quick Google search and without reading through developer manuals for hours. Python is also in the process of surpassing the other programming languages on sites such as StackOverflow. It is the language currently taught to most computer science novices at universities. At the moment, it seems like it really is the future.
Agree, but chill out. OP will learn soon.
thanks! sorry for responding late I didn't see this
Well, I get the point, and as a rule of thumb I agree. But sometimes code using very good librairies tend to be more effective and readable than code without. And sometimes good librairies make it into native code too. For example, the guy behind Trio is I think trying to get his implementation of coroutines supported natively, perhaps along, perhaps in part replacing the already supported implementation. Perhaps another way of approaching my issue is to look at medium code-bases making extensive use of native async generators, to see if there is a good balance between efficiency and readability. Any source / repository to point me to?
Couldn't agree more
Part2: **Pitfalls** Let's shed some light on some downsides and possible pitfalls: Performance: Interpreted Python execution is slower than compiled languages, sometimes by orders of magnitude. However, as written above, this does not affect most real-world solutions. Pure Python hogs only one CPU core (global interpreter lock, GIL). "Multithreading" in Python means multiple "threads" in one Python interpreter, on one CPU core. Multiprocessing gives you access to more CPU cores but it means several Python interpreters run in parallel, each with a big startup penalty - only making sense for longer-running processes. Pure Python is thus not the best language for CPU intensive applications. One way to work around this is to find the critical path and functionality and then optimize there with your C++ knowledge or "release/relax the GIL" - that's the way I do it, for example. Libraries such as numpy achieve exactly that and provide great speed along with easy use and fast development. GUI applications: though you can use QT and other libraries for great user interfaces, creating a large GUI application can be a challenge - for example, due to the way "multithreading" works in Python. Granted, creating large GUI applications is a challenge in every language. There is an official Python QT binding as of now but it is not at 100% yet and there are a number of other bindings with many more examples via Google searches. Also check the licenses. Python3 is the right starting point for learning Python today but Python2 (with many breaking changes between the two) is still around and old code bases will not die out for decades to come. If you want to be a versatile Python developer you should at least know the differences between the two and how to develop not-so-nice code that if you have to support both. Python3 is also still changing a lot from minor version to minor version. New goodies in new versions are not supported by previous ones. Libraries not in the standard library each have their own update cycles. As a result, packaging applications for shipping and deployment can be a harrowing experience as compared to other languages. Different operating systems and versions come with different Python interpreters. You can always install up-to-date versions but your end users might not. Creating "native", compiled packages usually refers to packaging a full Python interpreter together with your code and dependencies. No small binaries for you. This also means that Python is not the best language to program low-level stuff such as micro controllers. But those get more powerful too, so there is MicroPython to fill this gap if your hardware is powerful enough. One pitfall for a C++ programmer might be the dynamic typing - on the other hand this could make you a better Python programmer as you would never dream of changing a variable's type which is bad form anyway. **Books** As you are fluent in C++, you will quickly grasp the basics of Python to get up to speed becoming an intermediate Python developer. Once you are there, check these books for an epiphany: * Effective Python: 59 Specific Ways to Write Better Python * 59 short chapters on how to do things right in Python, with short examples and recap - great, easy read once you are at an intermediate level * Fluent Python * long, hard read on how Python works and why one way might be better than another * This is no book for an afternoon and you will pick it up again and again, even if you ever make it through - but it provides a deep understanding and intimacy with Python internals. **Real world examples** A well-known real-world application written in Python is Dropbox, for example. Python is also used extensively by virtually every big IT player, from Google (YouTube!) to NetFlix ([https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/python-at-netflix-bba45dae649e](https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/python-at-netflix-bba45dae649e)). There are many great applications we use and don't even know about that they are written in Python such as the "Terminator" terminal in Linux. Many huge web-sites run on Python web frameworks such as Django and Flask. **Finally, do not forget about the web site you are reading this on. Reddit was written in Python, too.** I hope this helps and you will have a lot of joy with Python. Cheers

Oh man, i would give u plat, but i don't have any reddit coins on my acc. Thank you for such deep and interesting answer. I think that i'll sink into phyton just to experience creating working solution in few hours (Yeah, i See that we shared mutual problems with c++ development so you can imagine thats unthinkable for me). Is there specific field that you would recommend for me to create my first anything with Python? BTW. my job is about servers virtualization. (sry for my English :p)
I was already making this for fun, then our class started talking about the coursework, so I'm now using this to make a mechanics learning aid. I'll probably rebuild it over the summer to be better and record the debugging
Thank you for your reply, you are welcome. I so remember asking myself the same questions. This is a throwaway anyway, no need to waste virtual coins. For your first anything in Python, I would recommend checking out the following free book and choose whatever you find most interesting: [https://automatetheboringstuff.com/](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/)
That made me chuckle
I surley will, thanks again for your effort, hope you will have great day, ill spend rest of mine slowly getting to know Python with cup of tea.

I read this as featuring unrealistic collisions and was very confused
Not really knowing quantum mechanics, what causes the wave to get stretched out like that?
^^
Thank you, a wonderful day for you, too! Two more pointers to avoid some pitfalls I fell into: &amp;#x200B; **1) Use the interactive prompt for help and insight:** Python has great built-in help in the interactive prompt, e.g., through "dir" (show all attributes and methods) and "help". These work for built-in stuff and additional libraries as well, once you import them and if they are well-documented. Example for Strings: python3 &gt;&gt;&gt; dir(str) &gt;&gt;&gt; help(str.strip) &gt;&gt;&gt; help(str) Exit with CTRL+D (Linux) or CTRL+Z (Windows). ...Stay away from the \_underscore and \_\_double\_underscore stuff ("dunder-methods") for starters. Those are Python's way of defining "private" stuff. You can still access and change them but it is usually not a good idea. You will need to overload some for classes in object oriented programming. &amp;#x200B; **2) Don't kill your operating system** I suppose you are on Linux: Overwriting/changing your system's Python installation is not a good idea as your OS relies on it and you might break it. As a rule of thumb, everything that requires sudo rights in Python tutorials could be disastrous for your OS. In Venv's, sudo is not required and your OS stays untouched. After installing Python3 and Python3-pip there should be no need for sudo. For a low risk approach for testing all kinds of libraries, use virtual environments: python3 -m venv YOURVENVNAME source YOURVENVNAME/bin/activate which python #should point to the interpreter in your designated venv directory which pip #should point to pip in your designated venv directory This creates a copy of the Python interpreter in the designated directory. As long as the Venv is activated (second line, your terminal should signify the change), libraries you "pip install" will also land there, leaving your operating system's Python installation untouched. Also an easy way to move a solution with all dependencies between two computers.

Well, I got some good news for you! I'm working on exactly that
Very cool! Will the mass also increase with size?
The size will be dependent on mass

There's a useful tool for rendering data that might be cool to use to render your simulation, it's called ParaView.
Working on multiprocessing as I'm making simulations for roulette. Just started with learning but already seeing big improvements in running times. Though now i'm figuring out the best way to store and use variables, as one function is used over multiple cores but with variations on the variables. There is still room for improvement as without multiprocessing a simulation with 1e8 turns takes 402 sec. and with using 10 threads it takes 86 sec.
I'd like one science, please.
Did you made this with turtle?
Just like the position has an uncertainty, so does the momentum and therefore the speed. As time goes on, the faster components of the wave package will distance themselves more and more from the slower ones.
If you got time, could you explain (like i'm five) what is this used for?
How did you do it?
Could be your versions. If you've python 3 and 2 installed then try installing using pip3 install numpy
You probably need to call an update() method. Some frameworks do it automatically, but other expect you to call for an update call. Changing the value of attributes does not make this call automatically. I am on mobile, but something like button.update() can do the trick.
It is open-source, non-commercialized chess website built by developers. I like that, and I want to make similar thing, only for card games.
A slot machine game for a school project. I’ve missed a bunch of lessons so I gotta learn a whole gaggle of new syntax and stuff just by trial and error. It’s going well though
If you are using linux you can create a cronjob. The only way to run a script when your pc is off is to run the Script on a server or antother pc.
there are many ways but your laptop/pc has to be on.
For the second question, could you give an example of what you want the script to do while your PC is off? maybe you could rent a virtual private server and run the script there?
So you have a brief overview of what particle-in-cell is?

that alone didn't work, but that was actually the last piece I was missing. I had to change to... odoStart = int(input("Starting Odometer Reading:\n")) OdoEnd = int(input("Ending Odometer Reading:\n:)) after i did that it still wasn't working but the parenthesis fixed it. Thank you.
Only joined to tell you I found a simple fix to our wifi calling DNS error. I had it for months too. I have moto 5 gs too, mint mobile, which is t mobile reseller. I read your posts here and on t mobile. I kept searching, as just lived with it for months, and after seeing you fail I got lucky. Some obscure post had the answer and made a simple comment he fixed it! Uninstall app manager, I did it, then rebooted and for the last hour no DNS wifi call error. I lived with it so long!!! If you still have your phone test this and then update your few posts on this issue. I don't generally post online anymore as a waste of time and I normally get into debates etc that are fruitless as not really real just babbling online. So I just sign up to tell you!! I had the exact same issue as you and they kept tell you to exchange phone, etc. Here is where I just found it, again I just decided to troubleshoot the issue for the first time and you were everywhere as the main one seeking an answer, well, this is it! I never even knew I had the silly app and mine has a stupid little green robot. I just added one-a star review to that app, but maybe all app managers do it. I read a few posts and it seems it may be a stock app install, not sure where I got it, but it let me uninstall it. I still saw the error, so rebooted and so far so good!! It jas been over n hour, and like you before if I rebooted it fixed it for 15 min but this seems different. Hopefully it does not return, but I think this is the simple solution. Here original guy found the answer... https://forums.androidcentral.com/moto-g5s-g5s-plus/923789-wi-fi-calling-fails-t-mobile.html?amp Here is the bad app for me not sure his but probably the same app. If you still have your phone and this problem and this solution works then update your posts here and t mobile site for others.

The `.agg` [method](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.agg.html) allows you to apply different reductions to different columns by passing a dictionary with methods. Here's a MWE ``` import pandas as pd df = pd.DataFrame({ "A": [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1], "B": [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1], "total": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], "quantity": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], "invoice": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] }) df.groupby(["A", "B"]).agg( {"total": "sum", "quantity": "sum", "invoice": pd.Series.count} ) ```

Oh, yeah. I forgot about/ misunderstood that. But that does make sense. Cheers mate for the clarification
Corey, i have learn so much from you, Thank you dude you are great!!
The Hamiltonian is an equation of motion in physics, that focuses on the conservation of momentum/energy in systems. By evaluating the partial differential equations of that formula, rather than integrating using Runge-Kutta, you can conserve energy in a system you simulate, and don't have to worry about your system losing or gaining energy in the rounding errors that are part of computing.
Corey - i learned most from him Engineer Man is great too!!
You get rid of the second copy of python on your computer. It’s possible to run 2+ versions, but it’s a lot easier if only one is on the path. Beyond that, Anaconda can change the version of python in it’s virtual environments, which is really nice and a whole lot easier than having multiple versions of stock python.

this is really cool
I am working in a hexagonal architecture example program for learning Python. [https://github.com/ferminhg/training-logger](https://github.com/ferminhg/training-logger)
"simple"...
Position = Position + Velocity Velocity = Velocity + Acceleration Acceleration = dependent on the positions of all other particlea
No. Only PIL and numpy
WHY ARE YOU POSTING IT HERE INSTEAD OF IN THE SUBREDDIT DESIGNED FOR LEARNING PYTHON?
/r/learnpython and read the sidebar.
I just read that book! I get that reference!
Essentially this is a particle in an infinite square well which means the the particle will never be able to tunnel through the barrier since the potential energy is infinite. Thus, this wave just bounces back and forth between the two barriers. What the actual wave is telling us is that is that the particle is located under this curve where the higher the peak the higher the probability of it being there (100% probability of it being under the wave). But as the Heisenberg uncertainty principle tells us, this means we know less about the particle momentum. As time goes on in the simulation, we will start to know more about the particles momentum and less about its position. Hope that helps! &amp;#x200B; Now some more background if your still interested. This scenario becomes very applicable to the real world and engineering when we move to an asymmetric wall. Imagine that the right walls potential is finite now. If the energy of the particle is great enough it has a probability of phasing through the wall! Meaning the we would have a wave on the right side of the wall with some probability p and one on the left with some probability p of it being there. If we think about this as a classically mechanics problem, imagine trowing a tennis ball at a wall where 90% of the time it bounces back and the other 10% of the time if phases through! If you're really into computers I'd imagine this is a fun concept to learn for it effects out everyday CPUs (quantum tunneling does at least) and for the most part can be learned with minimal maths skills.
No. Fuck off.
I've found that a raspberry pi is great for running cron'd tasks. That frees my desktop or laptop from needing to be on all the time
Ok thx
lmao
Use the code block button in the editor, or triple backticks before and after, to format your code properly. The error message tells you what's wrong. `what_scale` isn't defined when you try to call it. It looks like this is because you call `main()`, which calls `what_scale()`, earlier in the script than your `def what_scale()` line.

Thank you for the feedback! Very helpful!
Such a unique project! How are you factoring for the added weight of the dots(?) after a collision?
Lots of water and sleep.
You can perhaps also check [Numba](https://numba.pydata.org/), if it applies to your problem.
LMGTFY: https://github.com/slackapi/python-slackclient/blob/master/README.md
I just replace one of the particles with a new one wich has the values described by the formulas of a inelastic collision
You dropped this: /s
I think you might be mistaken.
Yep, I have that. It's weird because I can't think of one project I just couldn't do - I know how to find the information I need to get the work done. I've been professionally programming in many languages for twenty years and feel like an equal on my team. Sometimes, however, I feel like I don't know enough... So weird. That being said (to @op) the feeling you have is common and shows you care. You are never going to know the whole language, just know where to find what you need.
This is fantastic! I was a CS major and a physics minor until I switched from physics to math, and I love simulating physics and biology in code. I am interested in the approach you used for inelasticity in your collisions. Did you just decide that if the units are adjacent or co-located you add their masses together and make them a single unit? Or did you get more into it than that?
!. Go to settings view 2. Select editor on right hand side 3. select show invisibles about 3/4 of the way down

Such a thing isn't really possible unless your GPU is a Quadro model that explicitly supports running in a VM context.
Apart from the bit where you say "we bring our own shared libraries", this is not true and I have called you out for it before on reddit already. \&gt; So inevitably, you’ll end up compiling something against some host system libraries and some anaconda libraries and after an update you have a mess and no idea why it’s breaking with random segfaults suddenly. We have very clear delineation between system libraries (we call these CDT packages, they are repackaged CentOS6 RPMs and are not used very often - and less so by conda-forege) and non system, conda-provided libraries. conda-build checks every executable and DSO that it builds to make sure that any system libraries it does link to are declared in the recipe. Try to build any recipe that involves compilation. The DSO linkage information errors and warnings are comprehensive. \&gt; They can only fix those unintentional leaks on a case-by-case-basis, and a system without anaconda won’t have that class of problems, so I’ll stick with a system like that. Please show recent bug reports or issues you had. When was the last time you tried to use Miniconda (I recommend that over the full Anaconda)? We're pretty obsessed with quality and have some great things in the pipeline. disclaimer: I work for Anaconda on our compilers and tools.
I used the following method in my Particle class: &amp;#x200B; def test\_for\_collision(self): for particle in particle\_list: if particle != self: &amp;#x200B; distancevector = self.position - particle.position &amp;#x200B; if np.linalg.norm(distancevector) &lt; 3: &amp;#x200B; self.position = (particle.position + self.position)/2 self.mass = particle.mass + self.mass self.velocity = (particle.mass \* particle.velocity + self.mass \* self.velocity)/(particle.mass + self.mass) self.acceleration = np.array(\[0, 0\]) &amp;#x200B; particle\_list.remove(particle)
It should’ve kept getting closer and faster then when they collide 4 dots ejected in 4 directions and they float down back to the starting positions
Happy learning!
This also left me scratching my head. But if you watch, I think you can see the heavier particles accelerating slower. Good job, /u/mittwochmensch. Totally ausgezeichnet! I was expecting them to just stick together (totally inelastic without deformation). So two 1 pixel particles colliding yields a 1x2 sized particle. But I think the OOP way you're doing it, it will be easier to just scale radius by mass. Until you want to take internal compression and variable density into account at least. :)
Thanks. Is the code just making a shape and putting text in it or could I make it so that all my outputs go inside of it ?

Replace as much bare python with numpy as you can
This looks pretty much on the money, if I am reading it right. I suppose it would be way too nitpicky to have them meet at the mutual center of gravity rather than just the midpoint between them, but given the small distance (3 pixels?) it really doesn't matter too much. I really dig what you did here. I am guessing the big O on this is ridiculous, but have you tried it with more particles?
Thank you! Trying to get some data from a Google sheet, format it and copy it to another Google sheet
Hm. I haven't thought about that. It might be better since I had some situations in wich 3 or 4 particles collide at the same time, one gets slingshot. But you are right, usualy the small distance is insignificant. I am currently simulating it with ~600 Particles but it takes a long time for my PC. One simulation took over 4 hours! I will post an Update soon
Lovely !
all functions have an implicit return of type None. when you define the return you choose what type and value you'd like to preserve outside of the scope of the function.
Could you please give an example where "return" makes a difference I didn't understand what you said.
What do you mean by infinite square well? Obviously the plot itself has to be finitely spaced, but your label for axis ticks confuses me.
And projects? You missed that out this time - it's part of your original message to me and you, instead of explaining your decision, get terse and abrupt. I am genuinely asking for explanation so I and others can determine future actions. For example, what is a project to the moderators? How do you determine news? More detail on the transgression given openly, could help inform your readership and give you less work to do.
The return statement (not function), is fundamental to any C-based programming language. When you call a function, and want the caller to receive a value from it, you "return" that value to the caller. When you do blah = f() blah is assigned the value "returned" from calling f()

yah sorry I started on my phone and had to move to my pixelbook
I’m not a mod, ya dink.
Return basically assigns a value to a function. So I could say def aFunc(): Value = 4+20 return Value if aFunc() == 24: Your code here return is useful when you need to execute a lot of code and be organized, so you could just stick that code in a function and if you wanted all that code to return a string I.e., return is what u use.
So the one spacial dimension is x. However, the Schrodinger equation is a PDE. When we solve for the boundary conditions we solve for the potential energies. Thus, in this problem there are three boundaries; left of the wall, the center, and then right of the wall. When we solve it we find that the potential energy is 0 in the center "Inside the well" and infinite outside the well "Barriers". If we had barriers with some finite potential energy we start to see the effects of quantum tunneling.
That one seems outdated to me, because it talks about the need for a "Slack API token". And when I google for how to get one of those (it doesn't say in that tutorial unless I'm missing something), I find [this page](https://api.slack.com/custom-integrations/legacy-tokens) which says: &gt; **Legacy tokens** &gt; You're reading this because you're looking for info on legacy custom integrations - an outdated way for teams to integrate with Slack. These integrations lack newer features and they will be deprecated and possibly removed in the future. We do not recommend their use.
I actually just finished a course in PDE's and boundary value problems, so this was a great explaination! I just never had thought of the boundaries based on different potential energy values. Neat :)
Look at the difference between function_0 and function_3. They are the same but the former doesn't have a return statement but the latter does. What is the difference in output? That is why you use return.
I'm in the process of renaming the project from \\ PySimpleGUIdebugger to imwatchingyou There's no reason to have PySimpleGUI in the name. This is an application that happens to be built using PySimpleGUI, but that's where it all ends. This is an application unto itself, so, I chose the name ***imwatchingyou*** because you get to "watch" your programs internals while it's executing. And I thought maybe the slight "creepiness" may make it memorable. Now the problem is how to "migrate" people over. Even though it's only been a couple of days's there are a couple thousand people that tried it. I would like to make it smooth for them if possible.

Oh,I am so sorry for causing problems! I definitely didn't read the rules of the subreddit! I will be more careful next time. Have a nice day :)
This is quite amazing; well done!
Are you able to share code?
Beautifully done! Any plans to try out a well or a barrier?
Thank you! I would love to see it!

Here is a sneak peak: http://imgur.com/gallery/Ir9wKSs But I still have to Adjust some things
Thank you! Yes, I want to make a finite asymmetric well where you can change the barrier potentials to allow more quantum tunneling.
I use pop os and it came with python 3.7.3 installed
You've raised their standing by *not* being a member. My apologies for replying to you as such.
Depends on what integrator OP used, it would likely eventually spiral out or in. If it took relativity into effect (I doubt it) then it is inherently unstable anyway, as there's no absolutely stable orbits in relativity.
Yes I will post it on the right sub, thank you. What do you mean by the fact that I don’t need to use loops ?
Just try them all out? Part of being an engineer is testing things for suitability and listing the pros and cons of them
Thank you for your answer! I am trying it right now. I can’t figure out why it doesn’t work but my knowledge on multiprocessing is not enough yet I guess
I agree, we all know gravity is a lie made up by NASA to hide the reality of the flat earth. It is meaningless to calculate such interactions between objects, as a mode for understanding of the behavior of satellite, since satellites are fake because space is fake, and learning the formulas behind this is just indoctrination. We live under a dome on a flat earth. Density is the force that causes things to move. Wake up sheeple!
This is based on my personal experience of these things. If it's purely an ephemeral key/value store, them memcached is great. If you want more advanced data structures, persistence and much more, redis is great.
cool. I'll have to try it out one day. Elementary is pretty cool on an old core2 duo we had lying around, but mostly I stick to Ubuntu.
The majority of problems can be expressed in a "vectorized" way, using only linear algebra. That will generally give you a 100 to 1000 fold speedup, and is best practice.
No worries, good luck with your problems
I didn’t know that thanks ! I looked it up a bit online and found more efficient ways to fill a matrix I wasn’t aware of
Lol
If you're just trying to fill with a given value, why not one of: shape = (100,100) ary = np.empty(shape) ary.fill(value) ary = np.full(shape, value) ary = np.ones(shape) * value
Actually it is not a given value. For each cell of the array, I have to do a regression and fill the cell with a calculus on the residuals of the regression
Could you write out what you are trying to do in english, without any consideration of the code required to do it?
Yes of course; Lets say I have 100 temporal series (each having a number assigned: 1, 2, ... 100 in order for them to be classified) For each pair of series in those 100, I do a regression. I then calculate the estimated standard deviation of the residuals and apply a simple formula on this standard deviation and store the result in the cell. The triangular superior of the matrix will store values for the régressions of a higher index temporal series on a lower index, and reciprocally for the inferior. Therefore in cell [2][65] for example, I would have a result from the regression of temporal series n65 on n2
Something looks off about the 2-body part at the end. It doesn't look like what I've seen of the known closed-form solution.
&gt;You've heard that machine intelligence is going to transform our lives any day now. This is usually presented in a way that is vague and non-descript. &gt; &gt;This week on Talk Python To Me you'll meet Patrick Hayes the CTO at SigOpt whose goal is to accelerate your machine learning by "optimizing everything". That's a pretty awesome goal! Listen in on this episode to learn all about it! This is episode number 51, recorded March 3rd 2016. [https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/51/sigopt-optimizing-everything-with-python](https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/51/sigopt-optimizing-everything-with-python)
In this sort of problem, 'regression' usually means fitting a model or curve. Since you are comparing pairwise "regressions," perhaps you mean something like the correlation or coherence between the two signals? Either way, it sounds like you probably want to be using a package that handles the details of this for you, e.g. scikit-learn, chainer, tensorflow, pytorch, etc.
Well, it's gaussian Integration so there is always some error
Here's a simple explanation -- A function accepts some input, does some calculation or transformation to it and then either returns or does not return an output. Let's say you've got some number and you want to square this number, and you want to write a function to do that. Let "num" be the variable for the number you want to square, "square" be the function and "squared_num" be the variable that stores the squared number. ``` num = 2 def square(x): squared_x = x * x return squared_x squared_num = square(num) print(squared_num) # this will print out 4 ``` By using the return statement you're "returning" the calculation done in the function and assigning it to the new variable squared_num. Now if this same function didn't have a return statement, you'd be doing the calculation in the function but by not using a return statement, you're essentially returning nothing and hence "None" will be assigned to squared_num.
this is a formula that specifically requires to work on the residuals of linear regressions between those series. I use sklearn to do so
Then surely you can write your formula out in a way that is purely linear algebra and just operate on the entire array at once?
You mention key:value, but also say that you have rows of text data. Does each line have its own key? Additionally - what do you prioritise? Speed? Compression? Human readability of raw data? Being able to load a specific entry without loading the entire dataset?
Maybe I could try ! I won’t be able to modify the code until tomorrow and but I will let you know how this works. Thanks a lot for your time and help !
Firstly, use ssh-keys in preference to password authentication. Regardless of that, if you want to get a password securely: from getpass import getpass password = getpass("enter the password: ")
How is the data currently stored? What are you doing to the data? Will the data need to be processed more than once? Is this running on a cloud API, vps, private server, laptop? Where are you going to store the data after? Will it need to be accessed through an API or webserver? Will you need to process the data again at a later point in time?
What is an off-white monitor, and why would you ask people who read /r/python what language you should use?

Yep. Came here to say this.
[This issue](https://github.com/cvxopt/cvxopt/issues/127) looks to be related to your problem and the steps suggested there may help you.
You could porobably find a way to do it with matplotlib but I don't know it. An alternative would be pyqtgraph, which is kind of overkill and comes with quite a few dependencies, but is a really powerful vis tool and has a builtin ROI object [http://www.pyqtgraph.org/](http://www.pyqtgraph.org/) [http://www.pyqtgraph.org/documentation/graphicsItems/roi.html](http://www.pyqtgraph.org/documentation/graphicsItems/roi.html)
I'mma capitalize the terminology so you can get into talking shop quicker :) This was also rushed and I didn't want to spend a lot of time with typos and conciseness. Everything about programming is in this structure: input -&gt; doing stuff -&gt; output Now let's imagine we branch off of "doing stuff" with more of them. input -&gt; doing stuff1 -&gt; passes data to inputs input -&gt; doing stuff1-0 -&gt; returns data from output input -&gt; doing stuff1-1 -&gt; this one returned no output input -&gt; doing stuff1-2 -&gt; returns data from output input -&gt; doing stuff1-3 -&gt; returns data from output does some arbitrary stuff -&gt; output Outputs from functions are generally implemented using return values. The MAIN FUNCTION calls other functions and is regarded as the "main part of the program". This thing has a bunch of tasks in it that you want to run. Functions are written to be MODULAR, aka, separate from your MAIN FUNCTION. Functions are generally written to CREATE, CHANGE OR DELETE something from the INPUT/PARAMETERS that is PASSED TO IT when it is CALLED. They are written to be REUSABLE, so that you DRY (don't repeat yourself). Just like in math, when you CALL a FUNCTION, you give it INPUT, and you usually get an OUTPUT. Let's make it human: You're wearing a shirt that says "MAIN". You have a list of big tasks in your hand that you need to do to make a party happen. Some of these things are multiple steps, and are really repetitive, so you invite some friends over. You give each of them their own special unique note with steps of how to do these sub-tasks. Your buddies, each of them wearing a FUNCTION shirt. They sit around until you CALL them to do their thing. You yell "FUNCTION2, "4", "VIP", "Bon Jovi". He goes to the store, purchases, and RETURNS you a phrase "Success: I have 4 tickets reserved.". (his tasks were to go to the city, buy tickets for next month's concert, and deliver them to you). You wanted that feedback of "YES I HAVE THEM" or "NO I DON'T". Functions can return any kind of object in Python, or they can return None. You can also return a list of objects, it's quite flexible. Create something in the function and return it. Return an integer, return False. Return None. Hopefully it's getting more familiar at this point.
This is awesome!
unless you have crazy requirements either of those will do the job. I commonly just go for whatever has the best tooling and support for the language I'm working with
I... but... how? I’m so confused by how amazing this is lol. Very nice job on this! How long did it take you?
&gt;You mention key:value, but also say that you have rows of text data. Does each line have its own key? Yes. Out of all of those, Being able to load a specific entry without loading the entire dataset is top priority.
&gt;How is the data currently stored? Currently the data is stored in CSV files. &gt;What are you doing to the data? An algorithm is going to come up with the key or row index, and the text corresponding to that will be shown to the user. &gt; Is this running on a cloud API, vps, private server, laptop? At the moment laptop, but plans for private server in the future. &gt; Will you need to process the data again at a later point in time? The data does not need to be altered if that's what you're asking.
I think he's trying to bot a shoe website.
If you don't want to just a simple 1, 2, 3 etc for the id, I'd go with objectid (mongodb uses this by default) that tries to reduce the number of collisions in an algorithm already. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22606364/collision-probability-of-objectid-vs-uuid-in-a-large-distributed-system
This might sound rudimentary, but see if python’s stock shelve module works for you.
I would be fine with the simple 1, 2, 3.
Elasticsearch.
PostgreSQL makes a pretty good key value db, and has some full text search functionality
Just MariaDB (MySQL) or Postgres. Much more manageable, flexible, supported, well-understood, etc. Some options you mention are in-memory, so in worst case you need a server with 200 GB of RAM.
I prefer MongoDB due to it's flexibility, and you can use just a 1,2,3 if you want. Most any database is going to allow, (even automatic) an integer as the key, primary key, or unique key (depends on the db) The biggest thing I learned about databases, the hard way, is the correct database should be used for your project... Duhhhhh lol... I wrote an app with an SQL database because that's what I was comfortable with. However the performance was not great, I learned mongo and found out it had things I didn't know a datastore could do for me. Definitely take the time to understand the scope of your project. Learn how you want to store AND access the data.

This comment is underrated, thank you sir!
Read the sidebar. Visit r/learnpython and read their sidebar. There is a *ton* of information already out there and curated for you; you've just got to take a second to have a look around.
You're asking for a "best" VM for doing a highly specific and niche hardware-specific task. There really isn't even one choice. The task you're hoping to do is in direct conflict with virtualization. Just dual boot.
You should look into vfsforgit if you want partial git repositories. Your solution relies on the github API and it will not work on other git repositories or git hosting services.
Pandas.resample
The documentation seems a little confusing but Ill play around with it a bit, thank you
This is exactly what i needed to get started on my image classification project, every python ML post on this stuff seems to use the typicall mnist dataset, and its tiring seeing the same regurgitated info worded slightly differently.
I am trying to learn how read data from and excel sheet with pandas and parse and manipulate it. Kinda basic but I am hardware guy, not software :) Data science is very interesting

Ok yes but come on now
For all the talk about how hard it is to get a threaded program right, this whole coroutine thing doesn't seem all that easy either. I guess it pushes some of the hardness into libraries, which is good, but still. With the right tools deadlocks aren't too hard to debug until you get into the really crazy stuff, and there's tons of lock-free(At the high level) patterns like queues anyway. Threads aren't that hard compared to FP and non blocking stuff.
I look forward to seeing it.

Ten million rows with 2,000 characters is about 20GB, even tens of millions of rows you're looking at a few tens of gigabytes. While you don't necessarily want to load that all in RAM at once, that's an amount of data that's not terribly difficult to process. Postgres or Maria will easily handle the data and searches will be really fast if you properly index the data. The database does not need to fit into RAM for either DB to perform well. You can also take advantage of Postgres' [full text search](http://rachbelaid.com/postgres-full-text-search-is-good-enough/) to efficient index and search your corpus.
/r/learnpython read the sidebar google first, ask thinks *in the correct subreddit* later

I’ll pitch SQLITE3. Very lightweight database and you can create in-memory versions for testing or production (if you have sufficient RAM). The beautiful thing about SQLITE3 is that the database is just a binary file. Store it, copy it, etc. It’s just a file

Could you provide a single example line of the text data? Doesn't need to be real data. BTW, it's always helpful to include this type of info from the start - it's super nice for us to provide suggestions when there is plenty of info in the original post ;)
It is 4 am where I live. I hate timezones.
&gt; Matter of opinion I guess but I would rather see python get 1.05x slower so that this feature is possible. You're missing the point. I don't give a damn about that 1.05x. I care about the fact that it misleading in it's own existence. Adding such a hook system would add CPU instructions to every act that causes an event. Microbenchmarks don't matter, general benchmarks won't catch the true issue that we may see performance hits that are far more significant (ex, 1.5x) in real world code.
You got downvoted because you were a complete dickhead about it in the thread. Tip: Don't be a complete dickhead.
Al, I just finished your "automate the boring stuff" udemy course and loved it! By far my favourite udemy course. I still crack up at the "anybody that says any different is trying to sell you something ; buy my book"
/r/learnpython
Yo, i love your book! It is the resource point to for anyone wanting to learn python, but also programming in general. I think your book does a great job at demonstrating what programmers actually DO. So many introductory books are just toy programs, and its hard to see what fills the void between toy programs and 100k+ line professional applications. Your book excels at showing the practicality of programming. Thank you! I would not be writing python at work if not for your book.
At best this should be a meta post on r/learnpython, it’s not a question for this forum. Also you seem to be doing a lot of work to gain those downvotes.
I remember a while back when I first started with python, the return function had me blown away. Not sure why, but it did. Try to practice using it and eventually you will be like "oh, that was so easy, am I dumb?". (my entire programming life)

Sounds legit...
Use docker or pipenv because Linux actually supports cgroups and chroot environments without installing a VM, or being super explicit about installed python version like every other OS. Linux distributes binaries, I'm unsure why you chose to compile as you already mentioned knowing deadsnakes. This seems like a deliberately oppositional standpoint. Also if you're only running on 3.7 instead of supporting multiple runtimes, how do you monitor performance regressions, breakages?

Ikr, I'd put this shit on resume "built a spam bot with a throughput of 150k messages/second"
😂
1. /r/learnpython 2. You probably did `print = 'something'` earlier in the session.
Thanks, :D, I'm sorry for asking stupid question
Did you set it or was it automated??? :)
Its WIP, feel free to make it better :)
Automate the Boring Stuff was the first programming book I read and Python the first programming language I learned... Boy was I disappointed when I couldn't find anything nearly as comprehensible for Flask, Kotlin or all the other things I've looked into afterwards. Thank you for sharing your knowledge and for understanding what 'beginner' means.
What is this, XOR over some key determined by your mouse position?
They're not really compatible, no. You'll have to reinstall your stuff.
Darn curvature of the earth. You need to move to a flat planet.
As far as your Python packages go, you can dump your environment packages to a yml file, I believe, and use that to populate a file to use as a requirements.txt with pip. As far as the environment variables and Python version, you will probably have to specify those manually at the time you create your virtual env.
Why would you expect that a tool written by programmers for their own needs would be designed for the use case of people who can't code? Development is complex, setting up software to be distributable and usable by non-programmers takes time and effort which nobody is going to put in unless you're specifically their target audience. Not all tools are for you, even if you might find them very useful. You're lucky that it's in Python (which runs on Windows without too much fiddling) and not Zsh or Ruby. Most open source tools are not written for everyone. They're written to solve a specific problem for a specific person or group, and then made available to whomever might find them handy or want to improve upon them. If I sound defensive, it's because your "they never even once considered this" sounds _incredibly_ entitled.
Yo I think you missed the point of my previous comment which is agreeing that their methodology and transparency with it are both rather unhelpful. I didn't think I was being that obscure. I don't know why they implemented as they did, perhaps if you're right and it could simply be walled behind an process argument, then that will come out in what I imagine is a more productive discussion around the PEP itself by the people who matter.
If you want to make a really good impression, refactor your code into a reusable library, cover it with unit tests, and then build multiple frontends for it. If you can show a well tested piece of code that works well both in a web app and a console application, that's going to be _very_ impressive.
/thread Well, that is a good challenge above all those challenges in the assignment. Thank you good sir. Hey Siri, how to make a python library.
Found exactly what I was looking for. How to read and create UML class diagrams !!!
My first project is a text adventure! Ive learned more building this little game than I ever have following a more traditional class based structure :D Although all I've made so far is a script that determines weather or not you are an adult based on your input &gt;.&gt;
I started making automated info-graphics using After Effects using Python. I made a whole tutorial for it too: http://codegreg.net/2019/05/21/python-project-01-create-automated-content-using-python-and-after-effects/
To make a Python Library you will first need to acquire an ample supply of constrictor snakes. The lease out adequate room to the snakes in. Final steps include creating rental cards that allow the users to procure snakes for small allotments of time before return.
It looks like you tried to define str or print by putting "Print =" or "str =" Post your code to pastebin and Ill look at it. I also just started Python :D
-50 karma. Wow. That was quite some read! 😬
LOL I literally has that thought aa I was posting... "hmm there's a project here somewhere"!
Thank God for vods
noted, updated the post, and here it is below &gt; Attentional, RNN-based encoder-decoder models for abstractive summarization have achieved good performance on short input and output sequences. For longer documents and summaries however these models often include repetitive and incoherent phrases. We introduce a neural network model with a novel intra-attention that attends over the input and continuously generated output separately, and a new training method that combines standard supervised word prediction and reinforcement learning (RL). Models trained only with supervised learning often exhibit "exposure bias" - they assume ground truth is provided at each step during training. However, when standard word prediction is combined with the global sequence prediction training of RL the resulting summaries become more readable. We evaluate this model on the CNN/Daily Mail and New York Times datasets. Our model obtains a 41.16 ROUGE-1 score on the CNN/Daily Mail dataset, an improvement over previous state-of-the-art models. Human evaluation also shows that our model produces higher quality summaries.
There’s a space between print and your open parenthesis. Write `print(` instead of `print (`
Okay. You mentioned that you have key:value data. I assume that the "key" in this case is the line number? Or is it text as well?
Other than the horrible bot detection rules for the site, nice list.
I'm not a professional programmer yet, but everything I've read about getting into a job is that it doesn't particularly matter what scraps of paper you have, from whatever schools or programs; What matters a lot more is your coding abilities. If that's somewhat true, I'd say skip Microsoft's course. There's plenty of free, and much cheaper, resources to learn Python with.
I have no idea what the hell is going on. Could someone be so kind and explain it? I know basic Python. :)
Thank you! It took about 3 days working on and off. Then like a day to touch up on everything.
Quantum???
Anyone looking at this should probably use boto3 over boto at this point. But good list
God dammit, 10am for me. Can never catch a break.
Quantum cryptography https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_cryptography.
**Quantum cryptography** Quantum cryptography is the science of exploiting quantum mechanical properties to perform cryptographic tasks. The best known example of quantum cryptography is quantum key distribution which offers an information-theoretically secure solution to the key exchange problem. The advantage of quantum cryptography lies in the fact that it allows the completion of various cryptographic tasks that are proven or conjectured to be impossible using only classical (i.e. non-quantum) communication. *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Python/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28

Sorry, what bot detection rules?
Yeah, that's what I was thinking, just using an int for the row number. If there's anything better I am open to that as well.
I didn't know about deadsnakes when I went to python.org. If the prefered way for a user to install python is deadsnakes, then the big yellow download button on python.org should point to deadsnakes, not a tarball of source code. I don't know why it is hard for linux-fans to grasp, but a project's main page should have the standard download format for the common case users. We are only running on 3.7 because our project is a website. We tell devops what version of python run in production. Why support multiple versions when we only run on one?
Where are you from?
I'd second this: employer's look for either a degree in computer science / software engineering or they don't really care about your educational background and care more about results.
I want to use a file in C:\\Users\\pc\\Documents\\Ai Test\\Text Test AI\\TestBench3 Rap but I have no idea how to reference it in the conda powershell prompt
This article doesn’t add anything new and doesn’t have any opinion on the topic. It also doesn’t clearly explain the PEP.
I don’t know which country you’re from, so I can’t help, but in the US they’re not helpful. I have like 10 different MTA certs on my resume and nobody looks at them. I’ve asked a lot of people about it, and they all said that in our field certs don’t matter, unlike IT and netsec.
1. /r/learnpython 2. What do you want to do with the file?
I just want to use it, as in normally you would type cd C:\\Users\\pc\\Documents\\Ai Test\\Text Test AI\\TestBench3 Rap and then type [train.py](https://train.py) in cmd, it is different here.
"Different" how?
Fortunately, the point of virtual environments is that they're reproducible. They're designed so that you can trash them and create another one with a couple of commands and a few minutes. Make sure all your projects have a requirements.txt which specifies everything you need for the full development environment, ideally with hard versions. Then you're one command away from reinstalling. If you're dependent on non-pypi conda packages, you can do the same thing with an environment.yml, but it means that you'll be forever dependent on conda.
No. Anaconda doesn’t follow the virtual version requirements and regular environments can’t install other versions of python.
You can't call it like you call it in command line.
&gt; We are only running on 3.7 because our project is a website. the internet can use python &lt; 3.7 &gt; We tell devops what version of python run in production. So you tell ops who have fancy new titles. This is throwing things over a wall. Devops is supposed to be the python programmers learning about deployment, contributing so things are not thrown over the wall. You also don't get to dictate in a devops culture. It's buzz-word dev-ops and it's harming both you and the ops team by allowing you to dictate they spend extra effort supporting your chosen python version. &gt; Why support multiple versions when we only run on one? If you only ever support one version, or only forward versions, then how do you cope with breaking change? What if the business decides you must in-future support python 3.5 because they don't want to pay ops and you have to backport those code changes? If you supported multiple versions you could pin to minimum 3.6 or 3.5. You would be forced to make decisions like "Hey fellow coders, you have to use `"x: {input1}, y: {input2}".format(**inputs)` instead of `f"x: {input1}, y: {input2}"`. You could set a performance budget and make the business case for one over the others.

Yours is the second book I used for learning Python. And it is so good. Thank you.
If I were to run the file train.py in that location, what would I do?
This command does exactly that. Are you getting an error?

You need to provide the full path, not just `train.py`.
Would that be C:\\Users\\pc\\Documents\\Ai Test\\Text Test AI\\TestBench3 Rap\\[train.py](https://train.py) ?
Yes, but in quotes, since you have spaces in the path.

While you may agree or disagree with the premise of the pip the fact that it will break a lot of applications or libraries is a big mistake. You should not do that unless you want to call it 4.0. Also for security critical applications using pip/external libraries may just be banned so good luck with that.
Look, you don't get how our company works. It was pulling teeth to get them to let us use 3.x at all. The rest of the company uses 2.7. They don't plan to upgrade. Ever. Our boss^2 traded favors to let us use a modern python, and we are going with the most advanced one available because we probably won't be allowed to upgrade it.
Thanks for your comment. I am glad that it helped someone
TBF apps depending on these libs are probably stuck with 2.7 anyway
Impossible. It *must be* that there is a conspiracy of /r/learnpython contributors pumping up a book over a weirdly arbitrary definition of "constantly updated".
I know a little bit about quantum key distribution (have actually done some work on single photon sources for QKD). I'm not exactly sure what this program is doing. Buuut my guess is that your simulating what sort of message you receive if measuring a stream of photons using a range of bases angles. When the angle matches that used to transmit, the message is received intact. The more 'wrong' the basis is, the more randomness is introduced into the message. But gotta say that's just a guess and funnily enough no-one ever mentions what happens when using non-orthogonal bases.
I am a bit advanced in python also then I don't have any idea. But it looks cool and functions Well with the cursor over method.
Wait I think it's a knob kind of thing. Well done!!
Got super tired of the food program I was making, so taking a break learning web scraping from "automate the boring stuff".
Me too!
Please keep the battery included
The only issue OP should keep in mind is if (s)he needs threaded concurrent *write* access. If it’s mostly read only, then I agree it’ll be great. If you do need thread safety access, you need to do some fancy work. BTW, sqlitedict is a thin wrapper around sqlite3 with a lot (and maybe *too* much) emphasis on thread safety.
What the fuck?! 3 days? You must be a genius dude cause that’s like really good time.
Ping???
Once this library will be able to download images/videos you get from the others withou notifying them you did so it will have a lot of usage in....science.
I would heartily second this fantastic advice: seeing a nicely decoupled system with proper separation of concerns is far more impressive than a flashy UI that is terribly implemented.
The title is misleading. The PEP is not about getting rid of "batteries included" but suggesting removing some libraries that seem old and unnecessary from the standard library. The goal is reducing maintenance by removing unneeded libraries. The proposal even suggests packaging them into a separate "legacy standard library" that can be easily reinstalled should you need it.
Yeah, that’s it

Oh I see, thanks for the clarification !
Your skills are important. The way you've gained them *usually* is not important. I say *usually* because on a market where demand for developers is lower than supply companies can set some filters like "we need a developer with a formal education in this field". I recently heard that something like this is happening in India: it's hard to find a job for a developer without having formal education. In most cases around the world it will not help you, but you should check job requirements in your region.
Which of the removals are actually in widespread use?
Doesn’t matplotlib’s scatter also take a ‘size’ array as argument?
You could create a polling function that checks job status on an interval.
Formal education like a degree?
Is that because you can statistically determine the message with enough key guesses?
This is not a best practices answer, just my own practice. 1. I keep my venvs in a central location, outside of any project folder. This simplifies working with the project folder, as I never want to transfer or commit or distribute the venv; that's something that can and should be generated from the requirements files. It also simplifies cruft-cleaning operations, when I want to cull the old big venvs. 2. I name the venvs the md5sum of the project path they relate to. I don't care what the names are, just that the venv path can be determined from the project path, and is filesystem friendly. 3. Yup [These are the zsh functions](https://github.com/AndydeCleyre/dotfiles/blob/master/.python.zshrc) I use to facilitate this stuff (`envin`, `envout`, `vpy`).
It was a while ago, but [here is the comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/ay349t/perl_or_python_or_something_else_you_can/ehy84zy/)
Cool list. Does anyone has experience with the listed TestScenarios? It looks like a lot like pytest fixtures but with more complicated setup. Maybe there's some functionality I'm missing in my quick skim of the docs.
This ought to be good.
You'll definitely need to touch on the GIL (global interpretor lock) for your series. Threading in python is great when you have IO bound problems but with the GIL CPU bound problems are unable to run concurrently.

Hi thanks for your suggestion. The issue is very much true, in fact I just discovered this issue just days ago. And yes, I will have to cover them in order to cover the limitations of threading in python.

To clarify-- it's a simulation of using [this phenomena](https://youtu.be/zcqZHYo7ONs) to encrypt a message. The idea is behind the filter a certain amount of "light" appears on the "behind" of the "filter" you are seeing, sampled by some chosen area. For example (I haven't looked at his specific code, but it would be one way to do it), squares of some size are sample, each square is a character, in order, top-right-down, the "intensity" of light, plus some constant per square, determines what character. Changing the filters changes the intensity on each sampled square. Calling this "quantum encryption" is an extreme stretch. It's a simulation of quantum phenomena, and he's using that simulation to encrypt some text. True encryption would be to use sensors and arduinos and whatnot to perform this detection on (a) physical filter(s). But that would probably he extremely expensive and hard to control.

You can do whatever you want. For instance, here are some docs on what is possible with the Text widget: [http://infohost.nmt.edu/tcc/help/pubs/tkinter/web/text.html](http://infohost.nmt.edu/tcc/help/pubs/tkinter/web/text.html)
Look into golang. My distributed computing class that started 3 weeks ago introduced me and I’m REALLY enjoying it so far.
[here's a link directly to the PEP](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0594/). The article pretty much adds nothing and misrepresents what the PEP is really about.
I've been a professional software engineer in the US for 10 years and I've never heard anyone talk about certificates to any meaningful degree. By and large I think it's accepted that, at least when it comes to something like software engineering (as opposed to IT, for example), a certificate doesn't really prove anything worthwhile. Showing what you know with code samples and proving you know how to think about and break down complex systems is much more important than proving to me that you know how to program Python to some standard from Microsoft.
oh ok, thanks. I'll check the Discord out as well.
Thank you everyone, if it's true that certificate is not worth the hassle, then I will just keep on polishing, improving and learning new skills so I can face the competition in the market. Once again, Thank you. :)
Bad bot, no dinner for you
The README file mentions `pip install -r requirements.txt`, but I cannot find any `requirements.txt`.
Robots don't eat dinner.
Both are solid places to go to get help, it's the web forum equivalent of "I don't know the answer, but I know someone who might"
Thanks for pointing out. I could have sworn it was there earlier. Added one just now.
For completeness, C extension modules can release the GIL too and could do all sorts of computational work in a thread if they're so designed
And another question: By using Sphinx automodule I'm able to emphasize variables in docstrings like: class Foo: """ :var name: instance name :type name: str """ The problem is when multiple classes have the same variable name - in such a case I have to make prefix like: :var Foo.name: instance name :type Foo.name: str That is kind of ugly (not with Foo, but with SomeNotSoSmallClassName... :), so is there a way to instruct Sphinx to look in current scope (it prints error with the scope in text) and so implicitly get this done without prefix?
Don't worry, I'll drops it's amperage. That should suffice. An evening of brownout is as close to no dinner as I can get.
Awesome, I didn't know that, I haven't really gone into the wormhole that is C extensions yet.
Given the absolute beginner level of this article and the pure python implementation I dont think mentioning that would do anything other than confuse the people that need it. If someone is just learning threading how to create python threads they dont need to he overwhelmed by something as complex as the requirements to really get anything substantial out of something like numpy matrix multiplication to replace for loops
This could work. def try_parse_vlan_id(vlan_input: str): try: vlan_id = int(vlan_input) if vlan_id &lt; 2 or vlan_id &gt; 4094: raise ValueError() return vlan_id except ValueError as e: return None vlan_id = None while not vlan_id: vlan_id = try_parse_vlan_id(input("enter vlan id: ") This will repeatedly ask the user for the vlan number until they give you something that's right. This is probably a bit more vanilla imperative python than what I'd do. I just wrote it on my phone, so it might not be perfect!
you're right, my response was aimed more at its parent and not at OP
The only ones that are causing an active debate are cgi/cgitk. Personally I think PEP 594 has a sensible rationale, though it is also possible that those end up not being removed upon popular demand despite the maintenance burdens.
I think it might be worth editing into your first article. It's important enough to need to get people thinking about it early but can easily be explained at a high level.
Regardless of the specific technology (I’m not familiar with Dask) as a general principle the system holding the file should chunk it up into pieces which get distributed. And that’s just about all it should do.
They're not entirely compatible as other people have mentioned, buuuut you can try to naively port a conda env to a regular venv by running "pip freeze &gt; requirements.txt" while in the conda env and then running "pip install -r requirements.txt" inside the new virtualenv. This won't be perfect but it should get you a file of all of the python dependencies installed with their proper versions in a manifest as a starting point.
Yes. A lot of developers I know have studied without going to universities or any offline courses. All the information you need is available online.
This is one of the coolest articles I've seen on here. Success stories with Python are awesome and it's even better to see people making practical uses in businesses with open source software.
I dont understand neither "self", sorry, can't help you :/
https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ I prefer to write my projects using this plugin. Looks like it will be a part of sphinx starting in 1.3. better syntax.
"On a side note, Kenneth Reitz, creator of Requests, is a great engineer; reading his code is always a treat." WTF?
No you can't call sigmoid with two params. This is wrong. it only takes x, which is a one parameter. I hope this answered your question. Can you please indent your code next time. Thank you. :D
There's not a lot to it really. `self` is always *automatically* the first argument to a method bound to an object. If you call `my_network.sigmoid(inputs)`, it's basically the same as calling `neuralNetwork.sigmoid(my_network, inputs)`. They behave differently since `neuralNetwork` is a class (with unbound methods) and `my_network` is an instantiated object (it's methods are bound to it). There are decorators to change this behaviour - see [classmethod](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#classmethod) and [staticmethod](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#staticmethod).
Also did you try cvar or ivar? (Instance vs class)

Well, I think i found a solution by accident. I moved forward with comparing the one town with others in the county using df.groupby('towns).Total\_Rev.mean() and the series returned included the format. So I went back and added the groupby function to the single town, and it came out more or less how I wanted it. I hadn't thought to try that because in my mind I had filtered the results to only a single town, so there was no instinctive reason to do a groupby. Fun stuff.
That's not doing what this is doing. Ping uses ICMP to determine if a host is reachable, but a lot of servers (unfortunately) have ICMP blocked. Additionally, if a web server crashes then ICMP will still work... HTTP will not. Personally though I'd rather just use curl, since that's built in to *NIX systems usually by default, and for Windows I guess this is handy.
You could use the [locale](https://docs.python.org/3/library/locale.html) module. For example: `&gt;&gt;&gt; import locale` `&gt;&gt;&gt; locale.setlocale( locale.LC_ALL, '' )` `&gt;&gt;&gt; locale.currency(town_finances[town_finances.Municipali=='EXAMPLE-TOWN'].Total_Reve.mean())` should return the string "$8,535,358.75", which you can then `print`
So, it looks like the keyspace is pretty much the angle calculated by the pixel the mouse is on? That's actually a very small keyspace and easy to bruteforce if so.
My question is specific to dask, which is a python library. General language-agnostic parallelization advice is welcome as well, but suggesting a different language doesn't really help me at all.
Nah spherical Earth is best Earth.
aiobotocore
&gt;Hello MatLabers Maybe try r/matlab...
pynamodb is much more Pythanoic than Boto3.
Considering the fact that the message is resistant to imprecise keys... fucking duh
By the time you get to a c extension there’s no point in threading anymore as it’s so fast
Sometimes, but not always. You don't know other people's workloads :)
Try porting a simple function to a c extension. It’s fairly simple. Just by adding typing to a function you speed up your function considerably. Helps a lot in slow pandas loops
In all seriousness though, was the keyword "tutorial" in there what most likely caused this thread to be hit by your bot?
I already understand threads better!
If you want performance, stop using python. Even node is so much faster and is great for prototyping. The only sticking point for python the ml libs
I love when people want to learn and really want to like the work that you've done, but I have to agree with the bot and say this should have been posted to learnpython instead. I'm going to come at this very critically, with the reason that you are **falsely** portraying yourself as an expert when your article and comments make it clear you are a beginner. You start off the article with false information: &gt;“Multi Threading” is the least used concept among python programmers Then your example of threading doesn't even make sense. You say look at this block of code: for i in range(30): time.sleep(1) Then on the threading half, you show us this: def operation(iterations): for i in range(iterations): time.sleep(1) t1 = threading.Thread(target=operation, args=(15,)) t2 = threading.Thread(target=operation, args=(15,)) You have already done the math and hardcoded values that are supposed to show how much time was saved. I can't stress enough how critical this error is in your article. Threading is used to concurrently run expensive operations. You (generally) have little control over how long the operation takes. In the real world, you can't just say "ok operation, take 5 seconds to finish instead of 10 this time". You need an example that actually looks like something in the real world. You don't show your code for using multiple-threads (3 and 6). Presumably because you don't want to explain the "magic" of where you changed it to sleep for 10 seconds, or 5 seconds or whatever. A better example (still using sleep), where we need to call an expensive function multiple times. Non-threaded version: def expensive_function(): time.sleep(10) for n in range(10): expensive_function() Threaded version: for n in range(10): thread = threading.Thread(target=expensive_function) thread.start() threads.append(thread) for thread in threads: thread.join() From there, you can build to passing arguments and a real example (file IO would be a good one) And I know its been said, but not starting off an article titled "Multi-threading in Python" with no acknowledgement of the GIL makes me raise my eyebrow.
Make Pangea great again.
No, the keyphrase trigger was 'newbie'. It's a pretty solid autoreply keyphrase, as there aren't many posts like this which use the phrase in their title. I think it's accuracy over the past two months is something like 12 strongly correct, (measured by mod actions, op actions, or karma) 2 undefined (measured by the lack of confirmation by positive or negative karma, mod action, or user action), and this incorrect (measured by karma). Though for these numbers I just skimmed the bots recent comments on posts with 'newbie' in their title. I don't have the code built for auto scoring the accuracy yet. But that's how I loosely score the bots performance.
Of course, but if you're looking at interacting with the entirety of AWS's services you can't use a high level library like pynamodb
That's true. I try to keep my AWS interactions to a minimum!
I will! I've been meaning to, just have so many projects and not enough time 🤷♀️
Huh, cool. Thanks for explaining a bit
Highly recommend
Fair enough! We run everything off of AWS so I get to deal with all the nitty gritty details
Gotcha. I've only used AWS for a single project. I found Boto3 very hard to grok. If you know any good tutorials I would love to read up.
&gt; Helps a lot in slow pandas loops Whenever I hear this alarms go off in my head. Exactly what do you mean by "pandas loops"? In general you shouldn't be doing much looping with pandas, since you lose a lot of the benefits of the numpy backend
Sorry, but now you're rambling. Also it's funny you mention node, which in itself is a single threaded engine
I highly recommend [this typing library](https://github.com/alliefitter/boto3_type_annotations) it makes life a lot more bearable and I recommend [this add-on](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/console-recorder/). The thing to keep in mind is that anything you can do via the console, you can do with boto3. (some exceptions apply). I think a better way to approach at it is to see what AWS offers from an architectural perspective and what you can leverage and then figure out how to use its boto3 to glue them together. It's probably not worth learning boto3 in a silo.
You sure you use the right version of python. I mean I have had some issues with different version of python on the same device. Might come from there I guess. Can you import it in command line ? Check your versions
Thanks I'll check those out.
I’ve read up and down the pandas performance enhancements. Some things you just have to iterate over using the dreaded apply
There’s no need for threading on node when it’s that much faster than python for the tasks python is stupidly slow for. There are many things wrong with node, speed over python is not one of them, especially on the v8 engine
&gt;If an instance calls a parent class' function, then that instance will pass itself in as the first argument to the function. Otherwise, everything works like normal and you have to pass in all the arguments manually. I read from elsewhere. This is accurate for Python 3, as for Python 2, just forget about it. Here are some code examples: In [1]: class Bar: ...: # this is ok for Python 3 ...: def foo(): ...: return 'foo' ...: def foo1(self): ...: return self ...: In [2]: Bar.foo Out[2]: &lt;function __main__.Bar.foo()&gt; In [3]: Bar.foo1 Out[3]: &lt;function __main__.Bar.foo1(self)&gt; In [4]: Bar.foo() Out[4]: 'foo' In [5]: Bar.foo1(Bar.foo()) Out[5]: 'foo' In [6]: b = Bar() In [7]: b Out[7]: &lt;__main__.Bar at 0x1050be7f0&gt; In [8]: b.foo1() Out[8]: &lt;__main__.Bar at 0x1050be7f0&gt;
I hope this is allowed, sorry in advance if it isn't
I never said node was slow. Please take your lame trolling elsewhere. This is totally beside the point here
Some people may care but I don't
 default = { 'address': '0.0.0.0', I'm impressed -- and not exactly in a good way. You'd think that, of all the projects, one like this would have some idea of why they need to support v6... and yet it defaults to v4-only (or maybe only works on v4; it's a little hard to tell just from source code inspection) and also seems to only support v4 payloads. Forget "Forget IPv6", from the repo I can't see any evidence that the people behind this thing even know it exists in the first place.
You come with your snarky comment and I’m the troll? Write python 4 to prove how cool you are hackerman
I was initially trying to use MatLab, but they told me to use Python, since I do not know anything about the two ...
Not appropriate for this sub. Don't care. Check the sidebar before posting. If on mobile, check sub rules.
&gt; Try porting a simple function to a c extension. It’s fairly simple. Or just write Python code and wrap it with Numba's `@jit` decorator :)

So it’s a nice tool, but it’s not necessarily checking if ‘a site is up’. A 302 looks like it would result in a down. There are other possibilities too, such as bad gateway (which doesn’t mean the site is down, but certainly unreachable from your current location). Not trying to split hairs, but thinking to maybe help your efforts.
Unless there’s something I’m missing, I’d tend to agree here. That should result in an error. Something along the lines of ‘takes exactly 2 params, 3 given’.
I use Git Bash on Windows, and it used to be that venv only created activate.bat, not the Bash-compatible activate script, whereas virtualenv made both. It looks like venv makes both in Python 3.7.0, but didn't in 3.5.3, so I'm not sure exactly when that changed.
Ouch, and thanks for your feedback. Your suggestions are very true, and I will update my blog right away. I am a beginner, and I write blogs to cement my concepts on the topics. GIL, is an issue that must be, and will be covered in the subsequent parts of the series. The goal of the first part was to make the reader belive that parallelism can have a significant impact on the execution of the program. And yes multi processing which is almost better than multi threading will also be covered. I will do more research on such topics, and will use them to ultimately improve my subsequent posts in the series. And, I will also take into consideration your valuable suggestions for having more intuitive function names. Thank you for your constructive criticism.
Yes, I will do that as soon as I have access to my laptop.
I messed around with this for a bit and this was the best I could do. Unfortunatly it only works with sphinx.ext.napoleon. Without the extention it only give a description of the variable no type link. class A: a = 1 "int: the a attrib" #: int: the b attrib b = 2 def __init__(self, c=3): self.c = c class B: a = 4 """int: the a attrib""" #: int: the b attrib b = 5 def __init__(self, c=6): #: int: the c attrib self.c = c

1. I like putting them in each project root. That makes it easier to configure tools like VSCode generically (`"python.pythonPath": "${workspaceFolder}/.venv"`) and auto-load the environment when `cd`ing into the project. 2. I use `.venv` for the same reason of making config generic. This is also the default name used by Poetry when you set `poetry config settings.virtualenvs.in-project true`. 3. That's a good approach since it's built-in now. That said, I'd recommend checking out something like Poetry so that you don't actually have to manage virtual environments yourself. I've started using it for my projects and like it a lot.
I have worked with dask before.(2 week R&amp;D) Each worker will need their own local copy of the csv/txt file. Otherwise you could use a file hosted on aws / hdfs etc etc. The dask scheduler does not distribute the CSV. It will aggregate the data in case of aggregate operations like join. I maybe wrong so don't quote me on this.
Python in Processing code is in the blob_slices dir in my generative art repo: https://github.com/aaronpenne/generative_art
not quantum
I’ve been geeking out with asyncio and sanic for concurrency. Asynchronous functions are built into the standard library too. You might get better mileage and documentation than multi threading.
People still care about binhex?
I'm not sure - it's been a while. It resulted in oscillatory sort of collections of particles. It's hypothesized that galaxy dynamics can be described by a 1/r force law... And, you know, I can't remember but the escape velocity from an approximately 2 dimensional object (spiral galaxy) would have a different r-dependence for escape velocity? As always, I need to look at this stuff again :) but again, I encourage you to try it, for simulations sake.
Thank you for this. It's a cool project that I might have to play with.
Personal or business project?
Are you sure that's what's in the tutorial? I searched a couple of the lines on Google, and this looks like the source: https://www.kdnuggets.com/2018/10/simple-neural-network-python.html This is the actual line there: output = self.sigmoid(np.dot(inputs, self.synaptic_weights)) Your version is missing the call to `np.dot()`. For reference, the line from your version definitely wouldn't work. `self` is always passed implicitly when calling a method on a class instance. You can pass an instance explicitly if you call the method on the class itself rather than an instance, but if you try that on an instance, then you'll get an exception: &gt;&gt;&gt; class Foo: ... def method(self, x): ... return x ... &gt;&gt;&gt; Foo().method(1) 1 &gt;&gt;&gt; Foo.method(Foo(), 1) 1 &gt;&gt;&gt; Foo().method(Foo(), 1) Traceback (most recent call last): File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt; TypeError: method() takes 2 positional arguments but 3 were given
When I'm over my cold, I'll give it a go! Thanks.
Yeah, I will miss a lot of kitty snuggle times with my cat to figure this out.
I don't care about your certification. I'm going to give you the same test problem and I still expect you to do better than the other people. Your ability to communicate your solution is incredibly important. Furthermore, the way we design the tests are so we can see you struggle. Nobody gets it right without help. We need to see how you work under pressure. I don't care if you learn how to code on your own, your company taught you, or you took a course. If you're good, you're good and if you're bad, you're bad. What I do care about is if your ability to use a specific language/framework/library is unique among other candidates.
That has a ton to do with the derivation of how orbits are defined. You'll find almost nothing is stable for even a small number of periods. If you define stability as a perturbation from an existing orbit to find out if it's stable or not, you get things much closer to reality.
They went all out to make a converter - and their potential audience is mostly non-programmers, but they didn't spend.... how long would it take to build a couple of command-line exe's to increase the accessibility of the project. It's a big effort to get something like 0.1% of their potential audience... such a shame.
How many video editors are python programmers? How many video editors would find a batch convert useful? I bet the overlap is tiny, and how long would making it in to a command line exe or something take anyway? Add the link to the end of the project page, job done. I wish someone would build it! -cries-
Thanks! So far sounds like I'm gonna manually scatter the data, then run the computation.

1. As pointed out, this subreddit is dedicated to discussions about python, updates, and the state of the language. Please post all queries regarding code help to r/learnpython 2. What you need is a basic list comprehension and a for loop. You will need to scrape either using the requests library or using a web driver such as selenium; after downloading relevant files, you will need to parse text using either basic string search functionality or regular expressions (regex). My personal way of accomplishing this task would be to use selenium as that is what I am most comfortable with. I would use a web driver for chrome to access each url. I would then return the text from each url, looping through the relevant exchanges/dates. Following I would parse the text using regex. Search YouTube for a video by Corey Schafer for a great introduction to regex. It is 53 minutes. After setting up selenium and importing the relevant libraries your code flow would be something along the lines of: Import statements Driver = WebDriver(path=path/to/chrome/driver) Exchangelist= [‘Nasdaq ‘, ‘S&amp;P500’] Date_list=[‘05221998’...] For exchange in exchange_list: For date in Date_list: Url =f’ ...{exchange}/{date} /.... Driver.get(url ) BeautifulSoup(driver.page_source).text .... Etc etc... this should get you started. You will just need to save the page sources to some relevant directory and then parse the directories. Two trivial tasks with google, and stack exchange.
The entire file must be replicated on every dask worker. You don't need to partition each file manually

Why WTF?
I'm not an astrologist, so you're going to have to spell things out a little more. You skipped a few steps there and lost me. I'm not familiar with Runge-Kutta. You lost me with your definition of stable, are you saying it's a path that nearby orbits will trend toward? Doesn't the existence of such a solution say very little about whether the orbit will be sucked into the origin? Not to mention, I am hard pressed to think of a case where two point masses would have such a solution. What we were referring to with the term stable was an orbit which, trending to infinite time, will not decay or escape. Do the physics change significantly between considering the bodies point masses and considering them, well bodies? I'm fairly certain everything I said is true if they're point masses.
I've found np.vectorize to be a faster and neater alternative to df.apply()
I just checked it and you are right, i forgot to put in np.dot Thank you for explaination
Yes but you can’t vectorise some functions
I’m not an astronomer either ;). I’m an aerospace engineer. I’ve never studied things like stars or quasars or black holes. I’ve done orbital mechanics and interstellar probe pathing though. So things like launch, Hohmann transfer orbits, orbital stability, rendezvous, reentry; hypersonics, thermal management, things like that. So Runga-Kutta is a method to improve accuracy when integrating. You typically fit a 4th order polynomial, but can do more and and evaluate the function at specific times (e.g. t, t+dt/2), which takes 1st order truncation error down to O(h^5) and total error to O(h^4). That’s still not good enough for the huge time steps you want to use, but it’s a lot better than V*dt. Depending on the method you use for integration, you can introduce fictious forces and you can also add excessive damping. You want to balance the two. A stable system will resist a perturbation and tend to stay stable (think a marble in a bowl). An system may be conditionally stable, but as soon as you perturb it (e.g., a 3 body problem or truncation error), the error tends to grow with time and it’s like you just drove off a mountain; it’s not going back. A good test problem for stability is to have a large mass like tye sun and a tiny mass like the earth. Give it an initial tangential kick and see if the orbit stays the same on each revolution. With no third body, it should, but what you’ll probably see is the orbit decay. This is not an issue with point masses vs. not. For solar system dynamics, you can use point masses.

Yes, you can create two threads and pass messages between them through shared queue.
Multiprocessing is no l neither better or worse than threading. They are different. Threading is good for speeding up IO (API calls for example), and can take advantage of shared memory. Multiprocessing takes advantage of multiple CPU cores while not having any shared memory (can't write in the same data structure, can't read from the same memory, thus this is much more demanding in RAM)
I want performance, security, and ease of maintenance. Why would I use node in this case if it's interaction is bad at all of these? Python is at least only bad at performance. Otherwise I'd just use D. Python sticking point is the language itself. JS is more verbose, and isn't built for handling data. The concept of slices makes working with data much easier, but is completely foreign in JS. Also performance? Really? That's ridiculous that you should mention JS in terms of performance. Especially when in Python you can wrap your bottleneck code with @numba.jit and it's going to be a fast as Go. Especially when even without that there's PyPy.
Python code is around 10-20 times slower than RUST, which is consistent with fast interpreted languages. Properly written Python code that leverages its libraries is very fast. You have no idea what you're talking about.
I have passed the "Microsoft 98-381 Introduction to Python Programming" exam and to be honest it is quite basic. Nevertheless, there are some python peculiarities that could fail you, but overall it's a basic exam. If you want to invest money in *certification* I personally would recommend investing in a course that has a lot of different projects that you can show in addition to you certification at the end of the course. Good luck and happy coding :)
Ugh sure you Can optimise python to run 1800x faster than normal or whatever the quote is. No one has the time to do that. Pythons usecase is not speed. Simple as that. Rust is markedly faster than and go is markedly faster than python. Depending on operation type. Pythons slowdown in pandas and scipy is typing. Mypy does not yet do anything to make typing static at runtime. Please do tell what standard libraries you are leveraging to make static typing a thing in python. Aside from sarcasm, I would if you could prove me wrong. I would this solution in python so I don’t have to branch out elsewhere to get my performance boosts
That was my point. I’m only talking about performance. People getting offended because they feel like I’m shutting on python. It’s a great prototyping Lang that I will use all the time. Except when it comes to performance. I was only makin. A comparison to node in performance terms. Don’t get me started on it’s bad parts
Plotly has online and offline plotting. [Here](https://plot.ly/python/getting-started/#initialization-for-offline-plotting) is their documentation to get started.
Depends on what you do. My performance problems in Python are limited only to memory usage in multiprocessing, and too the fact that whatever I wrote was 2x slower than SQL (complex row level processing that other people usually do using cursors (even slower)), but far more readable, which was an OK trade-off. Pandas is most often misused as a replacement for SQL. It's bad at it. Pandas is slow. Use it only when no other reasonable ways exist to pass data to ML. I composed a coding challenge we give to candidates. It starts off very simple (took me 30 minutes to complete the first tasks that are usually the only ones touched by candidates). The rule is that everyone who starts off with Pandas, will fail, citing performance issues. My solution is simple, tiny, also using Python, barely registering a memory footprint. It all depends on what you want to do with it.
In that case, post on r/learnpython, and include your data and what code you have so far so that we have something work with.

Yeah, we’re in the same path. Of course sql is much more performant than pandas. I have exhausted that route. The operations I need to perform are model based per row. Vectorisation is not possible to the best of my knowledge. If I could be proved wrong it would make my life so much better
Well im working on a innovation project being stuck in the deep end of a project that is requiring Python as a code in the time I have been learning Python I have been able to open the program and use mouse and keyboard control to access the program ("Sapera CamExpert") but i need to take the program further and see about capturing images from the camera after it has moved 4 degree from the stepper motor inputs. &amp;#x200B; Does it make sense? it doesn't to be me ether. &amp;#x200B; Any help would be appreciated for a beginner like me.
Great input, out of curiosity have you tried LSTMs with multiple features such as technical indicators? If so did you normalize those as well? - mostly interested in the 'how' here.
multithreading might help, or it might not. It really depends on why your handler is slow. A better solution might be to use multiprocessing, or an async eventloop like asyncio or similar (if the reason your handler is slow because it's dispatching e.g. network events)
It does but it is still dependent from the zoom level of the plot :/
Great vid. I’d suggest to share it on r/Aussiefinance as well.
