Thanks for clarifying
&gt; That is what I usually start with but the pandas documentation isn’t very clear imo and I haven’t been successful with using the .read_csv commands. You can do the following when loading a file via read_csv(). names will replace the column headings. df = pd.read_csv(filename, names=['x','y'])
I repeatedly said that the advice was crap so the thicko moderators banned me as the thickos who didn't know what they were talking about got upset. There are so many vastly superior resources than the dreadful /r/learnpython that it's laughable that anybody can advise using it, except for yet another thicko.
I explicitly didn't subscribe to it (or anything with "learn") because I figured it would be flooded with idiots who don't know what's going on and questions that confuse me That subreddit would only be good for a tutor/professor/expert who won't get thrown off but hass-at backwards logic and can clearly guide the majority of people with questions
You gotta give me a little insight into what you're actually doing to get that error. There is no module in the dependency chain called `commands`.
I would not try and parse xml your self it is an absolute pain in the ass. I tried doing it for a laugh in C#... It quickly got annoying trying to deal with all the edge cases and broken xml. That's with out dealing with attributes and other weird things. If you do try and parse xml your self go with a class based, recursive structure rather than something like regex string manipulation. I would recommend you look into the requests library to get the xml automatically for you and beautiful soup the html parsing lib as xml and html are simelar. Also see if the site can give you json instead of xml. Some times you can change the response from an api can by modifying the http headers in the request. Json is a lot easier to work with. You may also be instrested in web scraping. I regularly find random sites and just try and scrape all of there data for fun. I always find it enjoyable to break apart a website and see what I can get. If this sound fun to you just pm me and I will dig out some links to some resources when I next get on my desktop. 
Learning django. Building a small eCommerce site, just to learn Django.
I want to go from C to Python, not the other way around. Thanks though! 
all ive done is use that exact code and this is the error Traceback (most recent call last): File "C:\Users\na\Desktop\f.py", line 3, in &lt;module&gt; import shadow as sp File "C:\Users\na\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python37\lib\site-packages\shadow\__init__.py", line 12, in &lt;module&gt; import commands ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'commands' &amp;#x200B;
I didn't set up a distutils or setup.py for it. Try cloning the repo and running `python example.py`.
Now i get this error Warning (from warnings module): File "C:\Users\na\Desktop\ShadowMusic-master\ShadowMusic-master\example.py", line 18 div = (sp.sin(space, 17) / sp.sin(space, 3)) * 0.2 * concertA #dividing signals to generate complex waveforms RuntimeWarning: invalid value encountered in true_divide &amp;#x200B;
The app we use is called MyState and it's free for all students, but I am planning on releasing my version to the public! Mine will just pull up a window with the tkinter package and display the predictions for the routes and stops you requested. So right now I'm mostly done just working on making it more general purpose so other people can use it. I'd be happy to post my final project when I finish!
it makes a noise i just get that error also just to clarify lol &amp;#x200B;
&gt; I would not try and parse xml your self it is an absolute pain in the ass. Really while not ideal I find running a request call and [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) py script to parse html/xml to push to zabbix on a cron. A easy and reliable way to scrape web site. 
Definitely do that! I implemented that same functionality :) 
Warning, not error. That's to be expected- you'll note that we're dividing by `sp.sin(space,3)` and a sin will sometimes output a zero. That creates a pop in the output.
Oh nice 
If I've understand, 
I've made the app on twitter and imputed the 4 different login items, yet it keeps on giving me an error. Any advice? Thanks.
Can you send me a screenshot of the error? You can direct message it to me if you'd like
Not sure what that monster in line 16 is, but it sure isn't python.

Okay the error was fixed. My next problem if you could give advice is deleting only tweets made by myself. I don't understand how to avoid deleting retweets, and to just purely delete my own tweets using the: "Delete tweets that have fewer faviourtes than: Delete tweets that have fewer retweets than:" as well as "Set Max favorites Set Unlimited Set Max retweets Set Unlimited" Could you possibly explain how to use these functions to only delete my own tweets?
*Then, you should checkout P++.*

As of right now I have it set up to treat tweets and retweets the same. One workaround you can do for now is use the "whitelist tweets" functionality to save all of your retweets. I will look into separating those out in the future.
Thanks for the message/review! Yes I mention that "clean architecture" is the name that Robert Martin gives to this type of architecture, in the first chapter. Thank you for spotting the error in the tests, I will fix it as soon as possible! As for the implementation: yes, I understand what you say, and I am aware that this might not be the best implementation of the concepts in Python. I'm curious to see other implementations, as after all, I am more interested in learning new things than to defend what I wrote ;) Thanks!
Exactly! It's pretty slow going at first but I literally know a 13 year old who can rip the stuff out in his sleep. It's not impossible! Keep up the work!

This is a bad first job because your first job should have senior devs who teach you how to be a better dev. I’m sure you can still middle through and figure it out but it’s not ideal. Your code will look hideously awful to you once you have real mentorship.

I'd go with [pybind11](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11).
That page seems to link to an out-of-date fork of [pybind11](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11) instead of to its main page.
I am also a noob. Although I think I could potentially solve your issue, I don't want to give you the wrong info. Also, the best way to allow others access to your .py files is via GitHub, but I really don't understand how to use it.

Of course! Thank you, I'll upload it now!
Working on dockerizing my flask web-app. Just found my first use case for a decorator, which turned out to save an absolutely enormous amount of boilerplate code. Figured out what the hell dependency injection is and how to use it, and why. I feel like I'm getting the hang of flask, and it's nice to have a ton of moving parts come together and work.
Just share it on github so that we can see the code
Oof. Sorry, but I /much/ prefer the separation of concerns promoted by both flask and django. Conflating business logic with front end elements? That just seems a little whack to me. Also, you should note to more junior folks that sending outbound requests will actually cause your WSGI service to block, which can be a Bad Thing (and even just provide links to related reading material).

What timing! I have been working on [some code](https://github.com/metaperl/wanderfocus/blob/master/wanderfocus.py) that needs to generate one of two sounds to train someone to concentrate their mind. I would like to have a bell sound for concentration and then maybe the sound of a loud restaurant when the mind is allowed to wander... 
A tournament in which everyone plays every opponent exactly once is called a "round robin." One example with 12 players is here: [http://www.mytennisgroup.com/no-confusing-round-robin-algorithms/](http://www.mytennisgroup.com/no-confusing-round-robin-algorithms/).

this is a little more complicated because it is 4 players all playing for them selves in one game. four teams if you will.
I enjoyed sololearn but W3Schools is definitely a brilliant source, I also recommend looking at documentation for some modules so you learn how to read that stuff.
Here's a chart from doubles tennis: [https://www.printyourbrackets.com/12-player-doubles-round-robin-tournament.html](https://www.printyourbrackets.com/12-player-doubles-round-robin-tournament.html) &amp;#x200B;
Or you could take the pairings from the round-robin and sit them together. &amp;#x200B;
I use python daily (for last ~ 1.5 years) and find this to be worthwhile so far. if you only care about learning Monte Carlo then I would probably recommend just finding some materials that strictly focus on that, this is more for gaining additional exposure to python through small projects.
This was the first thought i had but i was hoping to do it in less sessions by allowing it to be uneven. Is that not possible?
Thank you! 
Look into openCV and haar cascades. Food is pretty common so there’s definitely free cascades out there for them so you won’t have to develop your own.

Hello all, I may be facing a very interesting situation where I need to strip out a VIP's (VERY VIP) twitter handle from a bunch of archived tweets that I have both in an iPhone, as well as the internet. Basically, they don't want the VIP's twitter exposed to anyone and want to be able to either strip out or replace the tweets in the retweet fields in all of the tweets we want to send out. I'm not sure if something like this is possible with python, or exporting all of the tweets to DMs and doing find/replace with a batch processing program of some sort. Does anyone have experience with something like this, and/or suggestions on how this might be accomplished?
...is it Trump?
whats the /r/python discord? &amp;#x200B;
I'm practicing python requests to buy something on a Shopify site. Really interesting stuff. 
Might help if you posted something specific that you're having trouble with. If you're not even sure where to begin, start by breaking down (no code) the overall goal (the game) into smaller discrete tasks. Once you have your sets of tasks, start coding them.
Probably because everyone who says that had never bothered to learn C++? Just a guess
Geany is my default lightweight text / code editor. 
IDLE isn't an IDE. Neither are jupyter notebooks. It's like saying "What's your favourite fish? It's controversial, but mine is cheddar!".
It sounds a *lot* like you're claiming that C++ has simpler syntax than python, which is **patently absurd**.
&gt; I'm not even sure that counts Reading comprehension! 
For an IDE I guess PyCharm but using IDLE to launch things is really easy and fast.
It's great, simplifying is evolution in programming, eventually AIs will be able to write for us by plain language but that is a good bit away. I know C++ and other things provides deeper access and that is needed for now (also compiling is useful) 
I think the second guy clarifies it. The question is which language has the simplest syntax not the simplest language. C++ syntax is certainly not as simple as python. The language may be simple in architecture or whatever, but the syntax is not as simple as python who is designed primarily to be as human readable as possible. 
Yes I assume he intended to say "They never learned C++" or something along the lines of how it shows deeper programming but failed at doing so.
For the most part it is meant to mimic written English (although as minimal as possible) and many English conventions in math (for example curly brackets for an array).
Yeah they are fun but most only play them if they are hosted on a webapp like hitch hikers guide to the galaxy.
Yeah I hear that... I used to do JavaScript for em and I still could but I'm already writing this one in Python and would need to transfer the code over... Ah well lol Thanks for the info!
Grew up with them. Miss them, so I would definitely. 
Well I'm working on another one right now, let you know when it's finished, gonna use something to get it online. Think I might use repl.it.
Python is great for simple stuff, but i feel like i run into nothing but walls with it. I tried to implement a Tkinter GUI into a simple program i wrote, but since it contained a forever loop it would either get stuck in the Tkinter main loop or the forever loop of the program. Theres a ton of talk about it, threading, using the after method, and so on, but nothing worked. So i went with just standard CMD prompt output. On the bright side it looks pretty. I like python for its simplicity, mainly though because i took a year of python in highschool. To be fair, i also took Swift3 and HTML but I dont do much with either of those. Since highschool i have also personally taught myself a fair bit of javascript and c#. Comparing all the languages to python i feel like python just makes *sense* over the others. I like the way you import modules, i like how you declare variables and how everything is so black and white, a function is a function, a variable is a variable and strings are strings. Im not sure if its just that people learn python and are more familiar with that, so they think its simpler just because they understand it better or if its truly simple.
Serving static files can be super fast and streamlined when you're not pushing the process through the layers of a web app. 
Have you done web dev before? You kinda have to know alternatives to understand why flask is hyped as is. Personally I prefer Django but for something quick I’d definitely use flask 
No worries, if you don't need it you don't need it! https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/details.html#additional-test-output
I'm doing the same thing! I cant offer any help. But best of luck!
Ran the client, AV didnt flag it and it connected me It said 2 users online which i assume was me and you, but you werent responding, so maybe you were just letting it run 24/7 to see if anyone would connect. (If that was you) cuz i didnt get any responses back. Anyways, it worked fine, the text didnt wrap and the return key entered a new line rather than submit, also the GUI loaded ok
What's more shame than pipenv itself is that many tools we relies on like Pycharm and GitHub are eagerly supporting it, as if it's the standard and best practice in Python world.
No I am pretty sure you can use python and javascript to make a webapp for it, I wouldn't know in depth but python can defo be used as a backend for these things.
Also Cython. Just like straight C-Api it goes both ways 
I’ve been working on a text RPG as well. I’ve been doing Python for 6 months now and I never thought I’d been able to get here! Best of luck on yours :)
Pipenv should leave, it is a mess of code that combines a lot of things, a swiss army knife, it looks good at first sight, but you never feel comfortable when using its functionalities separately; and is designed in a very personal taste, without a convincing core concept and well-thought philosophy. &amp;#x200B; I think the proper way to work with Python projects is using poetry for dependencies management, and another tool for creating and switching virtual environment based on directory path.
I think I'm just going to repl.it which would be easiest... Could do brython or something to make it native, but I'm lazy and I want people to see the code directly pretty easily. Pretty sure repl.it will be my way
So instead of using a function url_for(), what if you just had the &lt;script src=xyz&gt; hard coded in the html? Wouldn’t that be as fast? How slow will it get if the files are small and you’re expecting from 45-60 requests an hour?
Repl is cool for testing code too, but I work with GUI's more so I don't use it as often.
Where else do we use a keyword to tell the interpreter to *not* do something?
This isn’t really an answer to your question, but I wouldn’t want anyone doing I/O without explicitly acknowledging the cost.
Yeah I'm using an IDE currently.. I'm just gonna use repl when I put it online lol
Wouldn't x() just be read as a function? Whereas await x() is wait for the function x() to happen before doing y(), I think that is it but I'm not sure.
I am new at Django and trying to build a web application for my internship. It has a simple login a logout authentication which is good enough at the moment and takes answers of several questions' input then saves them to my SQLite3 database. Application is working in local host of my laptop for now. Clients is displaying and answering these questions like we do on other web sites. &amp;#x200B; However, if want to change front-end of my forms, I have to manually put the same html elements that my forms have. This makes my code not optimised and makes me feel insecure. I am using functional view and "forms.Form" structure for my needs. I was wondering if class views and generic forms can help me with the my form-template conflict. For future plans I will make this a web api while learning JS and React so hoping things will work out. Later, I am hoping to start mobile application development instead of web view.
await doesn't imply I/O at all. It just lets the caller know that it is calling an awaitable.
In the typical case where x is a coroutine, it is semantically identical to calling x as a function.

i just came here to drop this off. scratch dot mit dot com. i dont reddit but i downloaded an extension that just shows me reddits. 
I don't think that is true! Python is one of the languages where its Syntax fosters easy readability, probably because it resembles to the style of *pseudo* programming, scienientists are using as notation for discussing or teaching algorithms. And for lots of people - including me - it is the best readable code overall. But its Syntax isn't the simplest one! You could easily prove that by counting the Syntax elements and compare them to other languages. All Lisp dialects - I only know Clojure and a little bit of Scheme - have much less Syntax. 
`break`, `continue`, `else`
I agree completely, and I have several thousand lines of async code under my belt. Unfortunately, the Python devs chose the same path as several other languages, not realizing the knock-on effects it would have to the language. Under your scheme you wouldn't need special `async for` loops or list comprehensions. Today, there is no generator expression syntax (ie no `(x async for x in agenerator)`), and there's no `yield from` in an async function. I've converted thousands of lines of python to async, and it was mostly to tell the interpreter what it already knew.
We already have a way of doing concurrency without explicitly marking the context switch. It’s called threading 
I wouldn’t want anyone doing potential context switching without explicitly acknowledging the cost
Isn’t it because simply promoting a function to async does not change execution model?
Explicit is better than implicit. The interpreter knows which function is async. *But you do not*. 
This isn't something people have to speculate about – both options were discussed extensively at the time, and the choice to make it not-the-default was taken intentionally. The reason for requiring `await` is that the Python designers view `await` as a flow-control operator, like `if` or `yield`, and in Python we don't like invisible/implicit flow control. This isn't discussed as well as it could be in [PEP 492](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0492/), but in the section "Why not reuse existing "for" and "with" statements" we have: &gt; The vision behind existing generator-based coroutines and this proposal is to make it easy for users to see where the code might be suspended. Making existing "for" and "with" statements to recognize asynchronous iterators and context managers will inevitably create implicit suspend points, making it harder to reason about the code. Another important influence was Glyph's well-known essay [Unyielding](https://glyph.twistedmatrix.com/2014/02/unyielding.html), where he argues that making points where your task can be suspended/resumed is important for making it easy to reason about code (and in particular race conditions). For example, consider this code: self._totals[key] += 1 With threads, this code has a nasty race condition – if two different threads run this line at the same time, then some of the updates might get lost. With async/await, this code is *guaranteed to be safe*. We can see there is no `await` in that line, therefore, we know that it executes atomically. I also tried to describe this [in my PyCon talk last year](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLkfnc_UMcE), in case you like videos better. (The discussion of async/await starts at ~10:25 in the video.) (Having explicit syntax also makes the implementation simpler and faster, because the compiler knows ahead of time where it has to await. Otherwise, the interpreter doesn't know which functions are async until runtime, so it needs to be prepared for *any* function being async, which adds overhead and complexity to regular non-async calls.)

In terms of the specific question about how to train your model - yes, you need to apply some techniques to turn the tweets into a "bag of words" (or rather, a vector representation). Have a look at the CountVectorizer function in scikit-learn and the various tokenization options in NLTK as a starting point - what you ultimately want to do is to extract the most _relevant_ words from your corpus of tweets (i.e. get rid of really common words or really uncommon words, maybe focus on specific types of words like nouns or adjectives, decide what to do with emoji or hashtags, etc.) so that you've got workable data that you can feed to your model for training. Don't restrict yourself to looking solely at neural networks; they're very trendy and they _are_ really good at some tasks, but for text classification on short documents like tweets they're often outperformed (in both speed and accuracy) by simpler things like Support Vector Classifiers. The nice thing is that scikit-learn is set up so that you can try out a lot of different models using almost exactly the same code - they take the same input and give the same output, so you can easily write a script to train a bunch of different models and see which one is the most accurate for your data. For the broader machine learning philosophical question... (Which isn't really a Python question but what the heck...) Yes, the model you train will effectively be mirroring *your* choices, including any biases you may have put into the system. One way to balance this out could be to work with other people on the human coding part of the task, so it gets inputs from various different people (but then you need to be careful about inter-coder reliability - if you all have very different criteria, it'll muck things up badly). Another, honestly, is just to say "okay, there's nothing I can realistically do about that in an undergraduate project" - sometimes there's no harm in acknowledging something as a problem with your research but doing it anyway, as long as you explain the resource constraint issue and do your best to fix the problem by showing how you ensured your *own* logical consistency in the coding process. BTW, 5000 coded tweets is a lot - if you can do that many, great, but a number half or even a third that size ought to still give a good outcome. You should also look at prior literature on this - there have been quite a lot of papers published in recent years about using machine learning or other text mining approaches to identify depression (or suicidal thoughts) being expressed online. (The suicide-related literature is more prevalent because there's more urgency about identifying those extreme cases, but the same techniques should work for you too.)
&gt; I would love to see no more 2.7 code around. &gt; We have a dreamer, I see.
Dreams must be big, as big as legacy codebases
From [The Python Tutorial]https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/), which is part of the Python documentation: &gt; Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming. Python’s elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms. So it is "easy to learn" and an "elegant syntax". But this does not mean it has the simplest syntax. I never heard that someone claimed that python has the "simplest syntax".
I love Python
I wish one day python catches up with the speedy languages or the hardware gets so fast that it doesnt matter any more.
You might want to consider changing the title of your post. Most people are self-centered and don't care about your story, they care about how it relates to them. I bet if you called it "how to learn source and building open source tools" you would get a lot more eyeballs.
I still do my everyday work in 2.7. As I've never coded in 3.xx, I'm actually afraid of the upcoming deprecation of 2.7.
I wish for a simple script to executable on every platform. E.g. Android, iOS, windows, Mac etc... Or for Python 3 to be built into all these OS... 
If you really have enough free memory (check with `free`) than this might also be caused by too many open file handles. 
You should really try! So much stuff has been added to 3x to make your life easier. It sucks that a lot of libraries might not be there yet :(
&gt;this out could be to work with other people on the human coding part of the task, so it gets inputs from various different people (but then you need to be careful about inter-coder reliability - if you all have very different criteria, it'll muck things up badly). A Interested in suggested papers. \~ Regards.
Kivy and Bulldozer purely in 3.+ 
I guess I should :) I should really start some 3X projects of my own. Wish I had the time!
I had to do a python 3, python 2.7, python 3 front flip when I learned python 3, got a job where they used python 2, then finally talked them into coding in 3.6
Just to hype you, check how to join two dictionaries or compose strings in 3x :)

Get rid of the most standard library. Promote the use of cffi and cython instead of c API. 
I want to be able to code different kinds of snakes....
&gt; Get rid of the most standard library. That seems like an odd wish to me. Care to elaborate on what that would look like, or how that would improve python?
Dude the standard library is awesome. Batteries included for the win.
I wish that someday python will let me make a living with it.
Happy Birthday
HB to you!
Can somebody eli5 the "standard library"?
I wish there will be no future with Python 4. We've had enough with version transitions.
Shit, python is a month older than me. I thought I had a few years on it. 
fstrings and asyncio are nice wait till you use the requests module

I wish for a pure python gui framework that's easy to use and looks good like java's swing. 
shorter syntax 
But it is right ? Get termux on Android and Pythonista on iOS
Happy Birthday! Live long and prosper!
Most programming languages have a "standard library" of basic to advanced tools (classes, functions, etc) that can be used in place of implementing the code yourself. For instance Java's standard library includes a GUI api that you can use out of the box without having to know the really low level system calls for graphics drawing on the screen or whatever.
Thanks! Why do people want to get rid of that?
Which OS is it? This subprocess call seems to indicate it's starting another process (or restarting itself) via fork... Said that you might have run into a commit limit.
Things that will never happen. I have the same wish
Please reintroduce "automatic tuple parameter unpacking" I would like to be able to write this: result = sort(dict1.items(), key=lambda (key,value): value) instead of the uglier: result = sort(dict1.items(), key=lambda elm: elm[1]) 
CentOS Linux release 7.6.1810 (Core) What you mean "commit limit"?
I hope it will someday reach python 4 which by then can build many things like high graphic game development like unreal,native mobile app development which shits on flutter/react native and so on. But dreams are just dreams...
I'm starting the upgrade at work now. The planning and bulk of the work is all on me. I'm freaking out just a little. There was always another priority...and here we are now.
Because people who say that have never heard of languages like lisp.
The murder of the GIL. I understand why this was used originally, but nowadays with the prevalence of multicore machines I think this is more a hindrance than an advantage
What does `dmest -T` say? You might be still getting killed even if you have plenty of ram spare due to a cgroup limit.
Python 4 which has breaking changes
Happy pythonic birthday!
Also, you do not learn 'source code'. You learn a programming language, programming, or 'coding'. You wouldn't learn how to 'food' either. You learn how to cook food.
Which libraries are not there yet? py3readiness.com lists 359/360 of the most downloaded packages as python3-ready, the last one, Apache Beam is also almost there: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-1251 I haven't come accross maintained packages that don't support Python3 for quite some time now. Which is great, because 2-3 years ago the situation was still quite different.
you meant to say `dmesg -T`? I found this in `mount |grep cgroup` cgroup on /sys/fs/cgroup/memory type cgroup (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,memory) Is there a memory limit??
Good luck. I'm currently stuck at that "another priority" part, and few months later I'm still gonna be stuck at that. Luckily all the libraries etc. are version locked for 2.7, and I hope there is no need to update to 3X anytime soon.
Nice writeup! Is the limfit module the same as the scipy curve_fit function?
Braces
It's a combination of html, css and python. Python iniates the element. HTML dictates the type of element it is. CSS changes the cosmetic features. The beauty of this module is that everything is one file. Got some neat features for micro apps as well. I will stick to flask, ninja templates, and js libraries to do these things, but I really appreciate the fact that the community still would like to make python the ultimate coding language 
It almost certainly won't be for a very long time. I believe that after 3.9 will be Python 3.10, unless I'm mistaken.
/r/learnpython
Definitely getting there. Love Pythonista, but both parties need the app or go through full development process. Currently difficult to roll out an apk unless anyone knows different and Macs have tonnes of difficulties with 2.7. Linux generally easy and Windows not too bad with pyinstaller. It's my wish that this all becomes seamless...

Nathaniel, what do you think about Lua coroutines? They brings ability to sit both chairs: change sync to async functions without changing upper code.
A functioning `antigravity` module.
Imagine all the people, using python 3
&gt; Most programming languages have a "standard library" More like a minority of languages. Most "modern" languages have one, as they this from Python.
This.
I wish for a touring-complete python which can run python 2 and python 3-code side by side. Let's call it Python 6 and change the logo to a snake with racing stripes, to make clear how fast and leet that is.
&gt; you meant to say dmesg -T? Yes. Is there anything returned when you run `dmesg -T | grep -i kill`? &gt;cgroup on /sys/fs/cgroup/memory type cgroup (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,memory) That's perfectly normal. 
I like python
That I stick to one thing and not keep experimenting with python.
I'm a journalist by trade, but my latest employer have been very trusting in letting me combine that with programming, so the last week I've 1) Written a script that grabs data from a Google Sheet through their API 2) Converts it to a Pandas DataFrame 3) Exports that to JSON for another department to use 4) Generates a simple article aggregating stats from the DF as variables. Then I wrote a very simple Flask server to host this locally so that the graphics guys can just access the URL and download the JSON with a click (including a preview of the data in the browser), and other journalists can grab the generated article as HTML. I consider myself a very basic hobbyist, but this is some of the most fulfilling work I've done in my 11 years as a professional, and it feels like I'm making massive progress every day. 
It's actually really easy - I did a medium-sized codebase that way and it was systematic work, but there were really no hangups. First, start by putting this line on the top of all your files from __future__ import absolute_import, division, print_function, unicode_literals and then make sure that everything works OK. (Probably 95% of the work will be fixing `print` statements, but do look at all divisions...) Then use the [`six` module](https://github.com/benjaminp/six) to write code that works on both 2 and 3. At the end of this, your code should work exactly the same on 2. Now you can try it on 3. 
"Let's get rid of the thing that most people like the best out of Python! Let's break nearly every Python program every written. What could go wrong?"
They're trolling. It would break almost every Python program ever written, for one thing.
I wish Python 3 could coexist with modules written in python 2.7 (yes, I'm aware Tauthon exists, but that's more the other way around).
It ain't that easy. People have been trying to do this for a decade now. Right now, if two separate threads do something like "append an element to a list" then there are only two possibilities - thread 1 appends and then thread 2, or thread 2 and then thread 1. If you got rid of the GIL and replaced it with nothing, there's a third possibility - "the internal data structures for the list get broken and Python will crash when you try to use it".
A real python to be inserted rectally for anyone still using 2.7
Que the "Have you heard of Kivy?!" response.
I don't get this comment. You can make a lot of money as a python dev.
Yeah, try it in Python: &gt;&gt;&gt; from __future__ import braces File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1 SyntaxError: not a chance (I kid you not...)
Aren't we there already? 
You're evil, haha.
For the thrift compiler to start building constructors properly. 
I haven't touched python 3 yet. Once I'm up to speed, I'll update this library to be compatible with both. 
I wish python 4 won't break backwards compatibility with python 3.
static typing (yes, I know the MyPy project) No more GIL
static typing pls
no... I haven't
The most difficult thing for me first was getting used to the print function instead of statement, but you get used to it. 
It's simple. I'm not a python dev. (Yet?)
Usually a major version change means braking changes. So (maybe|hopefully) no python 4? Only python 3.84?
Why so harsh against op, this is the problem with opensource, instead of praising the work and effort of the ops contribution, you guys criticize some meaningless errors. Shame on you. 
You are So right bro. Totally agree. 
Perhaps it is either a limitation that you hit in either filehandles or processes. http://www.linuxhowtos.org/Tips%20and%20Tricks/ulimit.htm If the error message is indeed correct, it could mean that the memory is fragmented so the process is unable to get a big enough continous part of the memory for some reason. I have encountered that problem with Java at one or two occations. 
Less deprecated libraries. 
IIRC 3.9 was basically going to become 4.0. So, maybe nothing too crazy
Concurrency support as in Go. Kill the GIL. Single binary deployments as in Go. Cross-platform compilation support for the aforementioned single binary deployments, also as in Go. Fuck it, I’m just switching to Go.

Have you checked out [goreleaser](https://github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser)? It is really awesome. I now distribute binaries for at least 6 different OS/architecture combinations for my go-based GitHub releases.
I think it only makes sense to change the major version it it has breaking changes that would make code written in 3 impossible to run on 4. There is this recent trend to just keep increasing the version number just to make it bigger (like Firefox and Chrome) that makes no sense to me. I am not opposed to breaking changes, if that means evolution, but if it's stable, it's stable... Semantic version ftw. 
For me pybee/toga is the torch carrier. I hope it meets its ambitious goals.
I know of that Easter egg. One can only hope though.

I wish a certain customer could at least upgrade to 2.7 at some point.
praise every contribution.... got it. /s
Been working on a tool that i can use to automate downloading of webdriver's for few other projects where i run robotframework in conjunction with selenium. Initially this was someone else's project but the original maintainer didnt seem to react to issues nor pull requests so i forked the project and and been updating &amp; maintaining it for a good while now (as part of my work). &amp;#x200B; Currently supports linux, mac &amp; windows and i just fixed the project to work inside cygwin too, wsl might be next and it can be used to download corresponding webdrivers for chrome,firefox,edge &amp; safari. Might add iedriver support but i havent really found a nice source of official releases that would provide atleast somewhat machine parseable source for them. &amp;#x200B; Project is available from pypi via name "webdrivermanager". &amp;#x200B; Besides that, been also helping out my colleges with with robotframework-whitelibrary that can be used to test windows applications. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
My comment was about getting this functionality in Python. I’m spoiled by Go.
I second that.
I wish that I can be a very good Python programmer. Right now I am a begginer because I just started to learn Python but for me it is a very good language!
That's some weird code, even for a beginner. What course are you using?
I don't say remove it and replace it with nothing, but i say that you have to get rid of GIL somehow: The issue that GIL solves is primarily about resource aquisition of different threads. Back in the day were multiprocessorsystems were rare and single threaded performance was more important, the easiest way to implement a type of multithreading while keeping the single threaded performance was to use a GIL. I would argue that nowadays single threaded performance is less of an issue, but a solid multithreadable architecture becomes more important year after year. The main reason why the GIL wasn't replaced yet is that many of the original C code relies on the GIL to work. But Python 3 already had to rewrite big parts of this C code so rewriting it again for a new Python 4 could aliviate problems that exist in the C code at the moment while making multithreading easier. On another note: The Python backends gilectomy, IronPython and Jython don't use a GIL.
Happy Birthday
No. Numpy, tensorflow and many other compute intensive libraries are implemented in faster languages.
Oh, it was intended as constructive, if it came off as harsh, I apologise!
It's not complete i think?
Yes
There were a lot of data structure optimizations between 2.7 and later 3.x releases. 3.7 will probably be even faster.
Ohh I see. I misunderstood what you were saying.
No far from it, but native widgets on all platforms is a pretty cool goal.
well they did a damn good job I was surprised to see the speed difference.
Yes , if it succeds. I researched a lot of gui framework for the project i am currently building and after a long search for pure python ones i gave up and am using pyqt5
Like assembly and FORTRAN. Why rewrite what you can FFI? Especially if the data primitives are nicer to use in Python?
Wish guido will connect to me on LinkedIn for lulz...
No, keep doing and using `url_for`'s, hard coded script tags and the like. What's happening is that nginx routes all requests to your Flask app (yes, even the script tags) who then serves them to the user. Separate your static files (images, scripts, css, libraries) in a different folder from your views, templates, and the like. Then set nginx to serve the static directory directly. (i.e. a new location block matching requests to your static files)

Didnt know you could do that. Whenever I use lambda I always wonder why they dont implement this because its so pythonic and intuitive. If they can add useless and unpythonic thing like assignment expression operator, they sure should add this back.
I remember Brett doing an informal audience poll at a PyCon plenary talk, and asking who even knew about this behavior.. when very few people raised their hands, he casually remarked something like, "OK, it's gone." This must be on video somewhere... 
A course in my school. I’ve could not attend to first licture so I was kind a improvising with the help of the lecture slides.
And I’ve just noticed that the format changed after I posted it.
I think web interfaces are the lingua franca for a GUI. Although if you want pure python nobody should rule out [curses](https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.html) without seriously considering if it would work for their users.

I just started building gui in python so iam just a beginner. But everywhere it's mentioned that both are essentially the same and code is interchangeable. And since pyqt is much older so it being more stable. Also gpl vs lgpl which requires you to buy a license for pyqt to build a commercial application
So I can write everything in python.

Get rid of GIL and implement something better
Fixed. New version [0.3.3.1](https://0.3.3.1) released.
Pattern matching instead of if/elif/else chains. https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch06-02-match.html#the-match-control-flow-operator

[hap.py](https://hap.py) birthday!
You're missing a colon, by the looks of it (if number == 1)
Also a lot of python3 features have been backported into 2.7, I'm glad for format str, with and round(), and I'm a bit reluctant with utf-8 characters in jsons. I need to run code on old servers with only python27 installed, but luckily it gets upgraded with the OS so it is recent python2.7.15 But I'm really fond of the new f"{v1/v2:.0.2f}" (2.7) and awaiting PEP572 inline := operator (3.8) Which will make me ditch 2.7 unless they are backported. 
If you prefer static typing in Python, you can use mypy to statically check types. For example: def print_name(name: str) -&gt; None: print("The user's name is", name) print_name("Joe") You'd then check and run it like this: $ mypy my_file.py $ python3 my_file.py A lot of common libraries have mypy type stubs available.
I haven't used npyscreen. You're right, it does look cool.

Linux generally has some overcommit enabled, while other unix might work with strict commit limits. &amp;#x200B; Essentially this means if a large process forks twice it's private memory is required during fork (virtually the memory isn't touched mayb some pages) until the child execs, the memory is mapped copy on write so twice the amount gets reserved. This is for a normal fork some systems have a vfork (sharing the address space with child must run and exec before parent continues) or a combined fork/exec like posix\_spawn &amp;#x200B; "sysctl vm" gives you three overcommit values like eg: vm.overcommit\_kbytes = 0 vm.overcommit\_memory = 0 vm.overcommit\_ratio = 50 &amp;#x200B; This should shed some light: [http://engineering.pivotal.io/post/virtual\_memory\_settings\_in\_linux\_-\_the\_problem\_with\_overcommit/](http://engineering.pivotal.io/post/virtual_memory_settings_in_linux_-_the_problem_with_overcommit/)
- Sane performance, - Sane concurrency (GIL really! Something like goroutines is great but it won't happen), - Better support for static typing, using static types to gain performance, Static typing in all libraries, - Sane anonymous (lambda) function - Stop adding nonsenses to language (eg, := operator) instead of good features. 
My valuable feedback: Storing numbered zip files in git defeats 90% of the value of using git. 
There's this https://goless.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ (never used it, never would :)) I haven't used much of coroutines (none), so I don't know what's missing. I'd assume at least the select would be weird in python. And problems with GIL are exaggerated I think. It's just something that is popular to bash on because it's uncommon. But it doesn't pose that much of an issue. Actually, it makes stuff safer! (a bit of sarcasm here of course)
Bring back `print` statement! ^^^please ^^^don't
For every python dev that requires better performance there are 9 that only talk about it.
I really wish 2.8
The problem with that is that it's non-intuitive, especially for lambdas. I _know_ how tuple parameter unpacking used to work and yet, your example requires me to stop and think if it's equivalent to JavaScript's `(key, value) =&gt; value` or if it works like it actually works. This specific example should really have ditched the lambda all-together and used `itemgetter(1)` anyway.
1. Don't use zip files when using git 2. Use Python 3 instead of 2 3. Read PEP8(!)
&gt; get rid of colons after if, def, etc Please no. It can catch errors (especially when refactoring), reads better, allows for at least some one-liners, ... and would still be required for `lambda`, creating inconsistency.
&gt; a turing-complete python Boy, have I got news for you!
Do you have an example?
Programming Python is good. Uses tkinter and goes into sockets etc...
Horses for courses. Some times it's better to embed ASM or call out to existing Java, C++, or C# libraries for compatibility and stability. My goal has never been to get everyone using Python all the time for everything. I think it's a much better world if as many people as possible are doing as much as possible in one language, and that language is definitely Python.
&gt;Yes. Is there anything returned when you run &gt; &gt;dmesg -T | grep -i kill &gt; &gt;? Nothing
For every person that requires gay marriage there are 9 that only talk about it.
Damn 2.7? Lucky I'm forced to use 2.5 
\&gt; I would love to see no more 2.7 code around. Short fix: I would love to see no more Python code around.
I wish Python is written in Python, not C. Oh, and I wish it can be compiled into a single binary with cross-platform compilation.
That's awesome. This is my first time hearing about this.
https://xkcd.com/353/
Took me a few weeks with youtube tutorials.
my vm.overcommit_memory = 1 I can't modify value: permission denied... I think my VPS provider is the problem...
I wish that their is tail recursion in python. Because of this I have to switch to c++ for solving most of the recusrion question. 
Maybe
My hope is Python not being a compute bottleneck. There's nothing wrong with using other languages for compatibility and stability.

I’d be seriously impressed if you fully learned it in a few weeks but yes to get a basic grasp it takes a week or two :) 
I'm all good with 2.7! Is there something specific in 2.7 that drives you nuts, heh?
&gt;java's swing Hell. I'll settle for a JavaFX and SceneBuilder equivalent.
Can you give an exapmple of colon help error catching? I'm curious.
I might not have think that one through and I conflated two issues into one. If the next level block would be still required after new line following if/def/etc, I don't think anyone would change.
There's no context switch. A coroutine awaiting on a coroutine puts the new coroutine on the call stack. You have exactly as much information about whether an awaited coroutine will pend as calling any non-async function. Calling `time.sleep` will pend the current call stack. So will awaiting `asyncio.sleep`.

2 weeks to 2 years. Depends on your study habits.
I’ve been leading the upgrade for the open source project Pants, which is about 150k lines of code. We’re publishing our blog next month, but tl;dr is: 1. Use an incremental approach. For us, this meant using blacklists with our CI. We would run as many tests as we could with Python 3, and run everything else with Python 2. 2. Use the future library. It’s a souped up version of six that is meant to write Python 3 code that also works with Python 2. 3. With the future library, it has a futurize script. Start by running stage1, which makes safe changes. Then slowly run stage2, which makes breaking semantic changes. Please feel free to DM me with any questions! It’s an intimating project but a worthy cause for how many Py3 features you’ll get like f-strings. 
I would like to have a job with an employer that is more welcoming to python development. 
I'd love to see people stop developing in python2.
3.9 + .1 equals 4.0 At least that was the plan when Guido was BDFL. Not sure if that's still the plan though 
Well ok; you might want to have a look at 1) f-strings and do the table yourself 2) pprint - the standart pretty printer Hauling a giant big data library Just to print stuff is... Yeah
'kill the gil' misframes the problem anyway - the gil is good and here to stay, it just needs to be made mostly non-exclusive. even hotspot has a vmlock.
Dictionary unpacking. Being able to do like `{"x": 1, "y": 2} = some_dict` (where 1 and 2 are default values) or maybe like `{"x", "y"} = some_dict` (no defaults) would be _very_ helpful. Being able to do use raise as an expression would be nice too, especially in conjunction with a None coalescing operator: `x = y ?? raise NoneArgument("y")` ala C#. Better support for generics because right now interacting with them is kind of garbage. Better support in terms of "yo, gimme the type parameters" _and_ getting the MRO of a generic in a useful way because apparently that's not a thing and makes doing metaprogramming with them hard.
The bigger problem is that it's a nightmare to support in inspection tools which are becoming increasingly popular due to type annotations flourishing. I used to use it but good riddance in hindsight.
BDFL
&gt; looks good like java's swing I think you and I have very different definitions of the word “good”
Hey, this is very interesting. I did a four-channel piece using NumPy last year for a gallery in Berlin. I was amazed at how effective and easy to use it was... the code basically worked the first time. But that was fairly easy, basically just a lot of linear fades between the four speakers. You have a lot of interesting ideas here which I need to read more about. Hey, you should put up a SoundCloud page with some samples so people could hear them!
&gt; or the hardware gets so fast that it doesnt matter any more. Python is plenty fast now because of this. If you want it to be faster, fix your program (because I guarantee you’re iterating a bunch of times you shouldn’t be), or if it’s still not fast enough for whatever you’re doing, use one of those speedy languages. 
&gt; py3readiness.com Just a heads up, looks like it's actually .org
I appreciate the argument that Glyph makes in making context switches via a `yield` or `await` explicit, however, the practical matter of a nontrivial code base waters down his argument. The problem is the viral nature of async functions. Any function that might possibly call an async function (or even a superclass method of a subclass that has an async method) must itself be async. You end up in a code base where 80% of your methods are async. **Almost** **everything** becomes an await, and nearly every function call ends up being marked as a potential context switch point. At this point, you might as well just assume that every function call is a potential context switch. You've already lost the ability to evaluate races locally, and you have to understand whether each function call might actually switch or not. At this point, the await keyword is just line noise. I already know if I'm doing race-sensitive stuff that I have to be careful with any function call at all (which is still far superior to the old threading case). TLDR when enough of your code base is async and every other line has an `await` or `async for` in it, the explicitness loses its appeal.
Amazingly enough, so is python. 
Death to the GIL!
Good is subjective i guess. Well i don't use java and swing is the only gui framework i know in java. I saw a youtube channel in which the guy was making cool gui using swing. The gui looked really cool and professional to a beginner in gui development like me.
Yeah! Death to the GIL!

Well, my main goal with having a separate language was to have a clear separation of concerns between the design of the pipeline and the implementation of its components; having a separate `.pipeline` file with an easy-to-edit description of the pipeline can create a useful abstraction.

I was grew up on IBM DOS 1.0 - I'm a 59 years old guy, who learned the basis of this language in previous year. I wish all the best for Python for coming centuries ...
I think you might be correct. I should've said "Python 4.0 will basically just be Python 3.10".
r/learnpython 
A simple wish that I do not keep discovering features that I had previously never used. I think I know it and then I discover I don't know it all.
Easier ways to distribute code to others. Virtual environments make it easier but I want it to be stupid simple. 
People stop moaning about it.
Okay but that doesn't explain the problem I had in mind. The problem in mind would occur with that with that setting set to 2. Anyway as you write with that much memory free as you said that shouldn't be a problem at all. 
Honestly it's no big deal, with one noticeable exception. The differences around strings and bytes if (say) you're taking data down the wire have been shown to be a right PITA. Besides that there are so many resources showing you how to port your code to Python 3 that I wouldn't worry about it, even assuming that you have to port. If it ain't broke, don't fix it? :-)
Usually I like to use Python for small scripts and leave the heavy lifting to something like C/C++. 
Now multiply this across many codebases that consume and interact with each other and different teams maintaining them with their own prioritized schedule. 
The requests module isn't standard Python, it's a third party module that's been around since at least Python 2.7, maybe earlier.
2.2? 2.7 is the last version of the 2.x anyone should be supporting these days. 
Assuming that you haven't read it all ready start here [https://docs.python.org/3/howto/pyporting.html](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/pyporting.html). Now, as they say on the stage, go break a leg :-)
I'd like off python's crazy ride plz. Most peps are ivory tower stuff. As far as I'm concerned, it's feature complete and most of the things the language actually needs is meta tooling, like actually good dependency handling, packaging and distribution. Just stop at what you have and what *needs* to be in the core language and isn't some cool thing you thought of when you were high last time. We are at a point where python does what it needs to do, we should be thinking about better ways to express what we want done in code, but that doesn't necessarily mean it should be done in python. Like, how to write functions and programs that are agnostic to whether they are executed in parallel or not. I can write a sorting function for a list that splits the list in however many threads I have and puts it back together later. I'm sure there are lots of cases where this could be applied, it's just super difficult to do.
i'm well aware its a third party module forgot it still suports py2 tho
Some Python 3 features were backported to Python 2.6!!! I cannot see the later features you describe being backported, so seems like you'll be waving goodbye to 2.7.
i am almost 5 months into learning python from scratch, no previous programming experience, and based on my current knowledge plus feedback from companies i am 3-4 months away from being ready for a job as a python developer.
Thanks! It's not so bad, when you put it this way...
All libraries that work only on 2.x are no longer maintained, so you should avoid them even if you are coding on Python 2
Thanks!
Maybe you could help get [http://www.jython.org/](http://www.jython.org/) ported to 3 and then you could just use swing directly.
You treat like if python 3 is a different language. That was a lot of FUD, just write code using Python 3 and you will be there. There really only minor differences.
Not if [https://pythoncapi.readthedocs.io/gilectomy.html](https://pythoncapi.readthedocs.io/gilectomy.html) works but note that I won't be holding my breath.
I read python crash course, learning python and then programming python and I feel the author jumped too far ahead with big examples and I found it very hard to follow. Even the author explains himself it is a very brief introduction to network programming. The book I felt was heavily Tkinter oriented. I think youtube would teach you more than this book. 
Have you tried PyPy?
&gt;turing-complete python This rules out Python 3, at least if you believe the infamous arsehole Zed Shaw [https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/nopython3.html](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/nopython3.html)
Removal of the GIL.
`pylint` with `--py3k` option is good at catching potential issues. It has some false positives, but appears to be fairly good at catching the divisions. Adding type annotations using comments and running `mypy` can catch other issues like bytes vs Unicode (note: that you need to run it twice, on Python 2 and Python 3, suche python 2 mode od a bit relaxed about that), but adding types might take quite some time.
I made a tutorial and video about how to use Python, Raspberry Pi, and the Dark Sky API to create a weather dashboard. [https://www.hackster.io/elizabethna/dark-sky-api-weather-dashboard-047ae5](https://www.hackster.io/elizabethna/dark-sky-api-weather-dashboard-047ae5)
Thanks! I plan to upload stuff to soundcloud once I've got the software a bit more mature (it needs an arpeggiator, at least). My goal this weekend is to use it to build a Louis-and-Bebe-Barron-esque piece worth sharing.
Did you succeeded Python 3 migration of is it still in progress?
I highly recommend you look into JavaFX. 
Calling time.sleep releases the GIL allowing other thread to run and mess up your data before you return to the same place. Awaiting coroutine in asyncio allows event loop to run other coroutines and mess up your data before you return to the same place. So yeah, context switch. Only in the latter case you know it explicitly from the code. It’s all about causality and knowing where it might be broken

Might as well just pick a different language at that point lol.
"Why is my code so slow? No, you can't look at the code. Guess." Okay, I'll bite... are you running things like this? for i in range(really_big_number): ,,, In Python 2, that builds a big list, then has to garbage collect the lot when the loop is done. In Python 3, that's a small, compact, fast lazily-computed "range" object. Are you assembling strings with repeated concatenation? s = '' for part in parts: s += str(part) That is *extremely* sensitive to platform and OS details. It may run really fast, or *painfully* slow, depending on the interaction between your script, the specific strings you are concatenating, the specific version of the interpreter, and details of how your OS manages memory. There could be a bazillion other differences too. Have you tried running the profiler to see where the code spends the most time? 
Hail yeah! 
Nope. What you want to do is use an if/else based on a random selection. Have a number. Between 1 and 10 be chosen randomly, if 1-5, do loop 1. If 6-10, do loop 2. That's a simple way to do it that's understandable. 
Might as well use Go at that point
This is not a dashboard. The code you're sharing is basically a data converter that pulls from the DarkSky JSON API, and pushes the data to an InitialState API. The dashboard has to be built in InitialState, i assume? &amp;#x200B; And you're not even building that converter in that video, you're merely telling people to get an API key and clone your code from GitHub.
Yes, that's how the versioning works, and it confuses many people, but if we believe [PEP 563](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0563/#deprecation-policy) the plan is to have 4.0 after 3.9.

Thank you so much! I’ve been working on this assignment a while trying to get this to work! 
I’m not sure what you mean? What are you referring to with 2.2? We’re supporting Python 2.7 and working to add Python 3.6 and 3.7 support. In two major releases, we will drop 2.7 and only allow 3.6 and 3.7. 
Compare subscriber count: &gt;r/TheMonkeysPaw ~160000 &gt;r/monkeyspaw ~2000 I don’t know about you, but I would go with the former.
We’re in the last stage: changing our release process to allow a Python 3 wheel. Our project uses Rust for its engine, so we have some complications with having to specify the ABI. Other than that, 97% of our CI is now running with Python 3 and we run it all at night with Python 2 through a Travis cron job to check for regressions. See https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/issues/6062 for our issue tracking the project.
&gt;Concurrency support as in Go. You could implement it with asyncio and processes, there is also lessgo as someone pointed out. &gt;Kill the GIL. It is easy to do it, but then Python is much much slower. There was GILectomy project, but looks like it didn't go anywhere. To remove GIL and still have performance I think we would need to once again break compatibility. &gt;Single binary deployments as in Go. &gt;Cross-platform compilation support for the aforementioned single binary deployments, also as in Go. Isn't [zipapp](https://docs.python.org/3/library/zipapp.html) module introduced in 3.5 essentially doing it?
Benevolent dictator for life. Unless you meant something else
I think the project's been long abandoned.
That's a good idea! My team and I develop this [service](https://periodix.tk/) that helps to find a job fast. We added different platforms and job boards to show the best results for a freelancer or remote worker. Perhaps, you find it useful!
wow, it's good. When will python GUI frameworks become this good \*sigh\*
Oh man. I just noticed that it is a quirk of your lists not line breaking on my device so the end of your first list item was right up against the "2." you used to number the list. 
/r/learnpython Put the loops in functions, put the functions in a list, randomly choose from that list.
Hah... yeah. You could use IronPython and WPF https://markheath.net/post/wpf-and-mvvm-in-ironpython But: Windows only. If you want cross-platform, .NET Core + IronPython and WPF may work, but I haven't tried it.
Oh yikes. I edited the post to hopefully fix that. Definitely not supporting 2.2 haha. Sorry for the confusion!
lol, not likely to happen thrift py lang is screwed bugs are features and features are bugs. They have someone working on getting thrift-py3 lang from facebook to compile outside of facebook. When that happens it will be awesome. Asyncio/Strong Typing/Fast

Currently, I am on a deadline to submit my college project. I am using pyqt5 for now. But I will try more during my summer vacation. Well, I am currently just playing with npyscreen that I just found out about, thanks to /u/[**MarsupialMole**](https://www.reddit.com/user/MarsupialMole/)

What platform are you designing a GUI for? Traditionally, Qt with PySide or PyQt was the best option for desktop apps. For web-based apps with a python backend, there are dozens or hundreds to choose from -- React, Bootstrap ,etc. 
&gt; I would love to see no more 2.7 code around. Yes. This! And performance Especially in for-loops Happy birthday, old slowpoke!
 &gt; So my question is, can I make my game in python and have it constantly talk to my javascript later on...? Yes you can build it this way. What I'd do, if this was my plan would be to build a separate front end and back end in Python, and have the front end send 'requests' to the back end, which it interprets and sends a response to. These 'requests' could be simple dictionaries containing the player input (and the player game state perhaps. Depending on how you want to deal with the game state). The back end could then respond similarly, with the text to display and the new game state (if required). Then when you want to turn it into a web application, you can 'wrap' the back end with the web server, building the end points which javascript will send requests to, and sending those requests on to the back end in the format it expects. This way you can swap out the front end, and add the webserver layer without modifying the back end. 
I wish to learn python beyond just basic concepts! damn, I said my wish out loud so now it will never come true! :(

Didja even TRY googling something like "python voice changer"? No, of course you didn't.
This isn't really a python question. There are plenty of voice-morphing programs out there choose one and pipe your microphone through when recording.
Downvote me back to old-style classes, but I'd like to see a 2.8 that has all the backportable features from 3.x and doesn't make me: &amp;#x200B; \* distinguish between strings and strings depending on what package I us \* write list(map(f,l)) \* ever deal with rogue floating point numbers except where I explicitly ask for them, &amp;#x200B; or anything else that makes me regret I don't have a rigid type system when all I want is to manipulate and display bytes of data. &amp;#x200B; I don't mind it living alongside 3.x for people doing stuff where those are positive features, and I'll concede the print function if that helps. They can probably even share most of the interpreter code.
I launched a course on *how to deploy Python machine learning applications*. It's been really encouraging to see students rating the course highly as I put a lot of work into it (100+ lectures, 8 hours of video, accompanying code repo). The course covers: - ML system architecture options - Using scikit-learn pipelines - Packaging models - Flask APIs for delivering predictions - Use of CI/CD for training/testing/deployment - Specific ML testing approaches - Dockerizing applications - Deployment on PaaS (Heroku) - Deployment on IaaS (AWS) If you're interested in checking it out, here's the discounted price link: https://www.udemy.com/deployment-of-machine-learning-models/?couponCode=REDDIT2019
The entire point of git is that you don't need to store different versions alongside each other in a directory - use branches or just the history (possibly with tags). If you want someone to install a particular requirement, put it in a `requirements.txt`.
They don't use a GIL because they run on a VM that has the proper magic. In CPython, the only way to remove the GIL is to lock the individual data structures (lists, dicts etc), but you pay a cost for that even when running single threaded. That was a cost Guido didn't accept. Besides, the discussion is irrelevant: 1. The only moment when the GIL actually comes along as a problem is when you want a secondary thread to do work. 2. if you want your thread to do work, you might be using threads wrong. Threads are excellent at waiting. 3. if you really want to do work with a separate thread, it means that you care about performance. 4. if you care about performance, you write your code in C, and therefore relinquish the GIL. The GIL is a non-problem. In all my 15 years career, I only saw one problem with the GIL slowing down a fast rendering visual appplication, and the reason was that the guy didn't know how to use threads.
Ok, so is nginx and flask running on the same computer? Sorry, I don't even know how to set up nginx or how it's used.

/r/learnpython And you've said there's a syntax error, but you haven't posted the error message. Why would you do that? Has it occurred to you that there's a reason that errors produce messages? That *maybe* the designers of programming languages included those messages to help debugging?
No need to get cocky. I dont know if this is how you satisfy your ego but I’ve clearly stated that I am new to the enviroment and programming. Take care, wont be needing your help.
GIL-ectomy.
I tried googling scripts for editing the audio in the video.
I don't fucking care 
How do you record through the script?
Well, Python definitively won't become a statically compiled language, I mean it would no longer be called python. Type annotation like mypy, can provide some benefits of statically typing, and that's great, but it only helps with bug hunting, it won't increase speed for example. The other day I talked with someone about it, and as looks like you think the same, that most of the time we do actually write statically typed programs even when language is dynamic and once in a while we use a dynamic behavior. So ideal language would be statically typed that allows once in a while do some dynamic operation. I'm wondering in case of Python such language is Cython. It's superset of Python, you can declare variable types which increases performance, but if you don't declare types you fall back to dynamic mode.
One of the key parts of learning is being able to read the most basic elements of documentation: for example, the sidebar of a subreddit telling you that there is an entire different sub *specifically* to help you with learning the language (and that such questions are therefore banned on this one).
Compiled pure-python modules to LLVM.
I have no problem making major and basic mistakes and I would be grateful if you pointed them out in a non-cocky way. Anyway, I am always open to improvement and will be more careful further on. Take care!
Yes. You extract the audio file (if it's not separate), import it to python, do audio processing, and output/save said audio file. Audio processing is signal processing, and that is a huge domain in itself. What exactly is your idea of scrambled / anonymized audio? just pitching it down? 
Python 3 shipped with Windows, and treated as a first-class scripting language; like Powershell.
A 'goto:' bit of code....I know its silly but its something I miss from the first programming language I learnt. It'd be so useful in Python:)

Python 4.0 won't break stuff. They learned plenty from 3, so the goal is to make all 3.x applications work fine without any modifications on 4.0. Python 4.1 though will replace indenting with curly braces.
Some time ago someone (I think in this subreddit) mentioned that they used Cython to migrate to Python 3. He essentially used Cython to compile Python 2 code and then import it in Python 3 then incrementally replaced Python 2 code with Python 3 module by module. It supposedly worked. I haven't tried it myself so I can't guarantee this is the right path.
It you want to know which vps provider have this memory limit it is Hostinger. They suggest a host upgrade to level 2, but i don’t want to upgrade.
It needs to be more then that because all it takes is pitching it up. Finding any useful information on this has been a gigantic nightmare. It's been so bad with people providing nearly useless information that I'm seriously considering filming b-role of standing in front of the camera and just using text to speech and pitching it down. I really don't want to do that though.
&gt; What would you like to wish for the 28y of python? Raymond Hettinger becomes the new BDFL.

I didn't know C++ had tail recursion. My understanding was that tail recursion was only available in functional languages that didn't have loops, and tail recursion was a way to implement them through recursion. Python has loops, so it is a silly reason to switch a language.
Tbh text to speech would be the easiest. 
This is so misunderstood, I suspect intentionally so. People need to stop being so daft as to pretend Zed was speaking literally. By calling python 3 not Turing complete, he was **mocking the claim that it was impossible to run Python 2 code on Python 3**. Zed was quoting others saying that Python 3 could not be modified to run Python 2 code in the same interpreter. Now, because all Turing complete systems can emulate all other Turing complete systems (that's what 'Turing complete' means), of course that's not true. Python 3 could definitely be modified to run Python 2 code, it would not be impossible, just difficult. The people claiming it's impossible were exaggerating to win the argument rather than fessing up that it was a matter of resources and practicality. They should have said it was *difficult*. Saying that it is *actually impossible* is equivalent to saying that Python 3 is not Turing complete, and is worthy of mockery. Come on people, you know better. Don't pretend to misunderstand a guy just because you think he's an ass. You can keep thinking he's an ass without having to disagree with every point he makes.
For algorithms like dfs where in iterative version its pretty hard to do pre and post order stuffs I have to switch, as python will generally give run time error even if the stack size is increased as well as the recursion limit. &amp;#x200B;
Spotify has a very nice API but I am not sure if they have added a python wrapper , what do you want to do?
I wish for stronger typing.
It's impossible, at least the impl cannot be robust. Some TRUE impls like macropy is so dirty(inspect, get source code via io), and others, the FALSE ones like Pampy, etc., just provide something inefficient, rough and plausive which I'd regard as DYNAMIC CONTRACT instead. To achieve the true pattern matching, at first we should support one of following ones: - Staging and macros, like Julia - Matching protocols(many years ago, in python ideas, someone proposed a feasible way to implement pattern matching via __match__ magic method) and pattern compilation. - allow user to request ASTs from compiler(this could make macropy less msgic and more robust)
Everyone's saying to get rid of the GIL, but what I would like is for everyone to stop misunderstanding the GIL. 99.9% of the people who think the GIL is their bottleneck are wrong. If the performance bottleneck of your code requires the GIL, you're doing it wrong. (And if you think that your current performance bottleneck is holding the GIL for most of its run time, it probably isn't)
It's basically all the stuff language that's built-in, that's available to you to use without having to install 3rd party packages.
the IPNetwork class in python's ipaddress module has an `address_exclude (network)` method for exactly this sort of thing: from ipaddress import IPv4Network supernet = IPv4Network('172.16.0.0/12') supernet_components = [] subnets_to_remove = ['172.25.64.0/22', '172.17.0.0/16', '172.19.5.0/24', '172.25.113.0/24'] networks_to_remove = [IPv4Network(subnet) for subnet in subnets_to_remove] for net in networks_to_remove: # first time we run .address_exclude() it returns a list of networks representing the fragments of the supernet # that don't overlap with the network we specified in .address_exclude. # We'll populate `supernet_components` with this list if it doesn't exist if not supernet_components: supernet_components = list(supernet.address_exclude(net)) else: # if `supernet_components` already exists, we need to iterate over it to find the network that `net` fits into net_super = None for supernet_component in supernet_components: if net.subnet_of(supernet_component): # Once we've found the network that `net` fits into, we need to remove that network from the list, # use .address_exclude(net) on it to chop it up, and then put the pieces back into the list. net_super = supernet_component if not net_super: raise Exception('Could not find a network in supernet_components that {} fits into'.format(net)) new_pieces = list(net_super.address_exclude(net)) supernet_components.remove(net_super) supernet_components.extend(new_pieces) from pprint import pprint pprint(supernet_components) Results in: [IPv4Network('172.28.0.0/14'), IPv4Network('172.26.0.0/15'), IPv4Network('172.24.0.0/16'), IPv4Network('172.25.128.0/17'), IPv4Network('172.25.0.0/18'), IPv4Network('172.25.80.0/20'), IPv4Network('172.25.72.0/21'), IPv4Network('172.25.68.0/22'), IPv4Network('172.20.0.0/14'), IPv4Network('172.16.0.0/16'), IPv4Network('172.18.0.0/16'), IPv4Network('172.19.128.0/17'), IPv4Network('172.19.64.0/18'), IPv4Network('172.19.32.0/19'), IPv4Network('172.19.16.0/20'), IPv4Network('172.19.8.0/21'), IPv4Network('172.19.0.0/22'), IPv4Network('172.19.6.0/23'), IPv4Network('172.19.4.0/24'), IPv4Network('172.25.96.0/20'), IPv4Network('172.25.120.0/21'), IPv4Network('172.25.116.0/22'), IPv4Network('172.25.114.0/23'), IPv4Network('172.25.112.0/24')] &amp;#x200B;
Just the normal stuff. Play music with some general controls (play/pause/skip), via voice control. Yes, I’ve read a lot about the Spotify stuff, that was what I found most of during my research. The only reason I’m looking for possible alternatives is because the library(s) I was looking at either do not actually PLAY audio, or have been deprecated. I can link the ones I was looking at when I get a second, it’s possible I was just looking at the wrong stuff. Additionally, as stated, I’m not opposed to hooking up to their API in a way that is currently supported via the official API, I was just curious if there was an alternative method for streaming in general, even outside of Spotify, that I was missing.
I wish [PEP384](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0384/) was more popular with authors of binding generators. Looking at you, SWIG and Cython. &gt;:-/

tkinter, time and random and turtle is fun too I guess.

So far my favorite is a new line after every opening bracket and brace. 
Could you expand on how it does work, and how it differs from what you expect? 
How about you simply downscale the image by your pixelation factor and them upscale it again with nearest neighbour? Would be literally 2 lines of code and very fast due to native opencv
‘socket’
Not yet, i am on python 3.6 and they just recently made it available for that version.
Ahaha this is true 😂 getting very philosophical here 
But yes you can definitely get a decent understanding of the basics in 2 weeks, but to be able to write useful and complex programs I’d say a few months

What would be good hardware to buy to speed up python?
My point is that it’s probably the program that needs fixing. Modern CPUs handle python quite well. 
I might just go with that. The only issue with it is the easiest way to do it is by having an avatar anti-SJW style because it's hard to do anything specific in a video when all the speech is going to be added later. Pitching down text to speech makes it sound a little less obvious and overall makes it feel better, but it's really not an ideal solution. Youtube really isn't the best place for monologues anyway. They're better suited to text and the advantage comes from people discovering your content through suggestions.
isnt `**dict` what you want?
I really disagree with your statement. I can care about performance just the right amount to still want to use python but not want my threads limited to a single core

Ahh cool approach, thanks! I was playing last night and came up with something somewhat similar... &amp;#x200B; import ipaddress import numpy as np supernet = np.array(list(range(int(ipaddress.IPv4Network('172.16.0.0/12')[0]),int(ipaddress.IPv4Network('172.16.0.0/12')[-1]+1)))) to_remove = ['172.25.64.0/22', '172.17.0.0/16', '172.19.5.0/24', '172.25.113.0/24'] for x in to_remove: remove_list = np.array(list(range(int(ipaddress.IPv4Network(x)[0]),int(ipaddress.IPv4Network(x)[-1]+1)))) for y in np.nditer(np.setdiff1d(supernet,remove_list)): f.write(str(ipaddress.IPv4Address(int(y))))
I agreed until you said Swing. Fuck Swing. I find it extremely ugly and will go out of my way to not use Swing applications because I have looking at them.
They works if I'm unloading all of a dictionary into a function or something. I'm suggesting that instead of: x = some_dict["x"] y = some_dict["y"] Or using `get` if a default is provided.
That the 3-4 transition isn't as painful as the 2-3 transition.
If you do BFS you pretty much have to implement it iteratively, DFS can be easily implemented using recursion, but you can also do the same as DFS and use stack instead of queue. We are trained to use recursion especially in coding challenges, but everything that is recursive, can be rewritten iteratively and generally it is faster (not that it matters in Python) and easier to turn that into an efficient dynamic programming solution. Also the way DFS works, I'm not sure if tail recursion will activate unless you write the code in a similar way you would write an iterative solution.
&gt; Like, how to write functions and programs that are agnostic to whether they are executed in parallel or not. I can write a sorting function for a list that splits the list in however many threads I have and puts it back together later. In Java, you can do this in one line: list.parallelStream().sorted() It sometimes makes me wonder why I'm even here.

Ping is a poor indication for if a server is up. Hung Windows servers often will respond to ping...
It's a bit confusing to make a GUI program using tkinter, but it's still awesome!
Other measures are implemented to keep services running. I will know immediately by the stupid number of calls and emails arriving if a service is hung and I'm not looking for an in-depth solution to reporting on that. Pinging is all I currently need, otherwise I'd look up an enterprise solution for reporting.

That's cool, but it wasn't really my point. It's more like... transformations into a different space in the mathematical sense? I have a problem and I write a simple program. Then the problem transforms in a known way, and I want the program to adapt or be adaptable. I don't want to insert function calls or checks every few lines.
I tried "1.1.1.1", "www.gmail.com" and "www.fhjdshehusgejqud.com" The script worked just fine, the problem seems to be that the direction is local. From what i've read, you can turn off the firewall or ensure that the AV isn't intercepting the packets, just be careful

Totally missing out. f-strings, ordered-dicts(by default), assignment-expressions (3.8), speed improvements, async improvements (off the top of my head). I haven't come across any packages I have needed to use that don't support 3.x.
I think it's fine when you take notes on it.
certainly a couple of loops on a range, not so much of the str addition ops. I know it’s not ideal without the code, hence my apology. It’s a pretty small script though so it really couldn’t be too many things.

zipapp doesn’t embed the interpreter or runtime...with Go, it’s machine code so the binary has the runtime and all depo compiled in statically.
I reaaaally like scikit learn and scikit image!! Another one I just came across is tqdm. I use it when I can't vectorize something and need to loop over a massive amount of stuff. It creates a progress bar with a bunch of cool information to let you see how much has been/still needs to be done.
I should begin using tqdm, thanks!
Add a feature to rewrite Reddit comments without deleting and this might actually become useful. Otherwise it'll just flag your comments on removeddit.com
Do you actually mean implement or do you mean use? They're very different. I use a car every day, I sure as hell couldn't implement one from scratch. Also, try and write some code without any lists or dicts, see how far you get. Or, in fact, read any python code at all, or any tutorials.

This is a good idea. It'd probably be super fast.
I cannot help directly but I'm vastly interested as I've suffered anxiety and depression on and off since 1982.

So for example, I could use a list to hold a priority counter for a log to be processed. Or a dictionary to hold a lookup of users. I wanted to know what real world examples people encounter Day to day to allow me to wrap my head around when or when not to use a list as opposed to a dictionary.

That was a joke, I wanted to imply they again are breaking all applications, although after thinking about it, this type of change would be very easy to apply automatically. BTW: Many people cite `print()` as the hardest part to migrate to Python 3. That part though is very easy to change automatically, and large applications generally don't use `print` instead they use logging. The biggest issue when migrating was the Unicode change, and the fact that most Python 2 applications are broken, because Python treats data and text as the same thing. Python 3 makes a clear distinction and disables implicit casting between them. While the broken code kind of worked on Python 2 and crashed with special characters, now it crashes every time until it is fixed.

I see this a lot for Python, but so does NodeJS, so does Ruby, Perl, PHP, Erlang, and any other scripting languages and noon scripting ones that use VM like Java. Go is a single binary, but even hello world is as large as smallest OS with functioning GUI (KolibriOS). The reason why scripting and VM languages exist is that you can write single code and be able to run it everywhere without modification. 
Numpy, Pandas, Tensorflow, OpenCV, Keras, Pytorch, Pocketsphinx, Librosa, oh there's so many.

I've all ready said it previously but I'll repeat, an excellent response, well done :-) The OP needs [https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/profile.html](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/profile.html) Then to show the difference it can make take a look at the following code from the \`eliminate\` function at [http://norvig.com/sudoku.html](http://norvig.com/sudoku.html) `## (1) If a square s is reduced to one value d2, then eliminate d2 from the peers.` `if len(values[s]) == 0:` `return False ## Contradiction: removed last value` `elif len(values[s]) == 1:` `d2 = values[s]` Put simply in Python it is way faster to compute \`values\[s\]\` once, say \`vs = values\[vs\]\` and \*AND\* don't call \`len\` twice as function calls in Python are expensive, so maybe):- `vs = values[vs]` `lvs = len(vs)` `if lvs == 0:` `return False` `elif lvs == 1` `d2 = vs` I did this when the wonderful Norvig sudoku solver came out and knocked 5% off of the run time speed. I will leave it to others to try this out on modern computers with modern versions of Python. Please let us all know if my original assessments stand up to modern scrutiny, not forgetting that runtime speed isn't the bee all and the end all of programming, productivity is crucial. 
From DWH QA perspective: pytest, pandas, ipython and jupyter, pyodbc, pylint, flake8.

Clever
I understood that, but what do i need to look for in a cpu to make python even faster?
`OrderedDict` from `collections`. Most of the stuff I've done revolves around Linux, so I use `os`,`dbus`, and `gi.repository` most often. `re` module for regular expressions. Wouldn't call them my favourite, but most commonly used
Two thoughts. 1. Use your favourite search engine to look for "python regex findall" as you will get loads of hits. 2. Use the standard Python REPL from your command line or an advanced version such as [https://ipython.org/](https://ipython.org/) to play with your examples as that's a great way to learn. 3. Ignore any advice to use /r/learnpython as it's a crap resource with much of it poor or downright wrong.
Infinity.
Raw CPU cycles, additional cores, more RAM. 
I wish to wake up from a nightmare in a world where python 3.0 didn't break backward compatibility.
You're obviously way smarter than I am, and even smarter than the BDFL, as he's admitted that he doesn't know all about the 200ish parts of the standard library, not to mention the 100,000 libraries available on [https://pypi.org/](https://pypi.org/). So without cheating how much do you know about [https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html](https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html)?
To actually learn this damned thing! I've tried AtBS, multiple apps, different sites with little challenges but I keep running into a wall and can't progress further. 
My Wish list : 1) Ability to package python interpreter easily for deployments, with no external dependencies (and no , virtualenv is not the answer) 2) Removal of the GIL completely 
Blah blah blah!!.. just remove the GIL already!

I hear PyQt is pretty good. But not native to Python I guess.
Thanks dude
Thank you so much! I will try!!
And fun fact Hunter S. Thompson died exactly 14 years later.
Coincidentally I decided to start learning Python today.
Thinkin' about start to a bot project for instagram.
Someone actually [implemented goto for Python](http://entrian.com/goto/) as an April fool's joke.
What are you using for the ecommerce plugins? Or are you building it out completely on your own? 
/r/learnpython and read the sidebar.
Beautiful Soup. 
It misses [https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#template-strings](https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#template-strings)
Not the answe you wanted but use twine http://twinery.org/
Should I be worried if I didn't get the joke? (a friend of mine asks) 
I want *tiny* single-file statically compiled binary deployments, as in go. Not a self-extracting zip with a whole standard library and a python / libpython.so that still relies on glibc.
Awesome! Sounds like we’re in pretty similar boats
I think that's not too far away from my research, been looking into this. Down with paperwork
Agreed. I just started it today.
This sounds interesting. What interests you about the data you’re collecting?
Right now, I have just started so you can say I'm completely building on my own. If I start using any I'll update.
Be careful with curses! My experience has been that there isn't much built in to curses. This means you'll have a lot of choice in how you do things but it also means you might end up doing more work than you anticipated.
Sorry about that 
MyPy feels so bolted on and is limited to other typing libraries like flowtype for javascript.

They announced it was on the short list last year but no other announcements since
I'll repeat for the umpteenth time that if you're not reaching for https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html then you're not writing Python. You should also see https://pypi.org/project/more-itertools/ which has the recipes from the previous link plus extras.
That block is in the Plotly API language, which is a javascript-based graphing library. If you just want to make a web app with basic UI, Dash is pretty good on its own. If you don't need a graph, then you don't need to worry about any of the Plotly stuff (even though it integrates nicely with them). It's actually possible to use Dash to build interactive web graphics with matplotlib (!!) or anything you want as the back end. 
I mean, the CSS is probably in a separate file. Plus, you can split up the Python into modules and classes like a normal Python program.
I'd start with the functions available under the heading **Combinatoric iterators** at [https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html](https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html). Don't necessarily write code, just play around at the Python REPL, please see [https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/interpreter.html](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/interpreter.html).
REQUESTS

```import re as witchcraft```
&gt;also compiling is useful Python is compiled, guess what this [https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#compile](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#compile) does.
Glad to help, cheers !
Can we get rid of this crapbot as it needlessly points people to the useless /r/learnpython?
itertools, functools, requests, pandas, numpy, argparse, cmd, code, flask, socket
yes but I mean when it all runs at one time instead of line by line.
flask, pygal, pandas, bumpy, nltk
I would be Interested to see it, and to know what your experience deploying with that platform is.
I forgot to mention in my previous reply, but are you starting a GoFundMe or Kickstarter for this?
Going to need some more elaboration there. Why do you consider that sub to be useless? 
I don't plan on "deploying" so to speak. I'm not trying to be a real indie Dev... I mean maybe it's the most indie indie could get.. I write games that are special to me and make me feel what I want. They're also chatoic because I don't really have a storyline in place just a general concept.. like this one, at the moment has 2 story lines. One is with a warrior named Brock and another is Ella the Archer. I have had years of computer programming experience but I've enjoyed writing these super simple stuff :)
Proper immutibility and chaining high order functions. Really I just want to map and flatmap and deal with futures like I have in Scala but have it in python. I hate having map be it's own function vs a method on a list, it's so much harder to write immutable code without scala's flatmap syntax. 
Data manipulation as good as dplyr/tidyr (pandas is fine...). Data visualization as good as ggplot2 (seaborn is fine...). Python's tools for these tasks are ok, but not great, in my humble opinion.
I wish to learn C++
I wish that youtubers delete their videos when they are teaching us an outdated python version OR at least tell us the probs in the comment section ( cuz modern codes wont work like ancient). But for now r/learnpython helps me
"And then I was like `witchcraft.search('^foo[A-Z].\d+?.*',some_string_var)` and the problem was gone" . . .something like that, right ? 
Python has came a long way in the past few years. Still my favorite language.
Eugh; what I really want is a static binary, with no unused stuff from the standard library at all. Like https://cython.org or http://nuitka.net/ but with aggressive dead code elimination to throw away unused code.
Repeated poor or downright wrong responses.
What would you suggest to make a GUI 
Notice no mention of the dreadful /r/learnpython :-)
Flask urllib Colorama json
https://github.com/jarvisteach/appJar It's a library which wraps away a ton of the boilerplate of tkinter and makes it really quite easy to throw a gui together. The best part is that all the widgets it provides extend the tkinter widgets, so they have all the same properties and capabilities should you need access to the more advanced tkinter functionality.
four years ago I was pretty exclusive to python, but I too yearned for more. I yearned for the ability to show other people my programs without having to install crap, the ability to do cross platform hardware accelerated graphics (easily!), and a chance to have nice looking UI. So I took a break from python for a while. Still used it, but javascript became my go to. It was nice. Now for small projects I've found that javascript is great for self contained projects for end users, and python is great for programs to be used by me or other programmers. It is good to have both tools under your toolbelt. &amp;#x200B; tldr I recommend you *pause* python and learn js.
I overwrite with edits right now, but I can definitely add a feature to rewrite without deletion.
&gt;from \_\_future\_\_ import barry\_as\_FLUFL whaT! &amp;#x200B; what else is hiding in the \_\_future\_\_ module?
&gt;Just stop and look at what you have and what *needs* to be in the core language and isn't some cool thing you thought of when you were high last time Good. &amp;#x200B;
Isn't it ambiguous? \`(lambda a, b=5: a+b)( (2,3) )\` should return \`(2,3,5)\` or \`5\` ?
&gt; I feel as if the python syntax is literally too basic for any real world application.... lolwut. https://www.quickstart.com/blog/10-famous-websites-built-with-python/

tqdm for making easy progress bars in CLI applications.
You shouldn't use for loops like that. Try numpy. This operation should take far less than a second.
"Controversial" Adorable.
Already working on it! Thanks! 
Yes
Have you tried the library? How about the python for noobs sub?
This is both awesome and hilarious.

Learn python is a great resource, it helps you ask questions and everyone there is so nice.
btw, this took me almost 600 lines of code for those wondering. I wrote functions for every single pattern and defined every single variable so that I could call it from anywhere in the program. 
The [learning resources](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/index) in the /r/learnpython subreddit is a good place to look. You can also ask questions about learning python there.

Hi there, from the /r/Python mods. We have removed this post as it is not suited to the /r/Python subreddit proper, however it should be very appropriate for our sister subreddit /r/LearnPython or for the r/Python discord: https://discord.gg/3Abzge7. The reason for the removal is that /r/Python is dedicated to discussion of Python news, projects, uses and debates. It is not designed to act as Q&amp;A or FAQ board. The regular community is not a fan of "how do I..." questions, so you will not get the best responses over here. On /r/LearnPython the community and the r/Python discord are actively expecting questions and are looking to help. You can expect far more understanding, encouraging and insightful responses over there. **No matter what level of question you have, if you are looking for help with Python, you should get good answers**. Make sure to check out the rules for both places. Warm regards, and best of luck with your Pythoneering!
Hello! I'm a bot! It looks to me like your post might be better suited for r/learnpython, a sub geared towards questions and learning more about python. That said, I am a bot and it is hard to tell. Please follow the subs rules and guidelines when you do post there, it'll help you get better answers faster. Show /r/learnpython the code you have tried and describe where you are stuck. **[Be sure to format your code for reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/faq#wiki_how_do_i_format_code.3F)** and include which version of python and what OS you are using. You can also ask this question in the [Python discord](https://discord.gg/3Abzge7), a large, friendly community focused around the Python programming language, open to those who wish to learn the language or improve their skills, as well as those looking to help others. *** [^(README)](https://github.com/CrakeNotSnowman/redditPythonHelper) ^(|) [^(FAQ)](https://github.com/CrakeNotSnowman/redditPythonHelper/blob/master/FAQ.md) ^(|) ^(this bot is written and managed by /u/IAmKindOfCreative) ^(This bot is currently under development and experiencing changes to improve its usefulness)

Appreciate your interest. Yeah, I had this idea 1 year ago but i've been through depression and panic due to anxiety and focusing on this work was making me pretty bad. Now I fired me from my job to take care of my mental health. Now I feel more comfortable putting effort on this final project to finish my undergrad. I know and read some papers about this area, lot of psychologists and doctors already working on that. If I want to contribute with that I'll need a lot of people of course. if you want to contribute with ideas, that would be awesome. Thanks.

But now that they exist, you can use them in Python. Not that there's never a performance issue with Python. My point is that for most things you can use Python in 99% of cases, and then optimize the remaining 1% (which you might be able to use Cython for, if optimizing the algorithm doesn't do the trick).
Pip installs opencv properly. It's just that some of the features are disable in pypi version. You need to manually enable these features and build opencv.

Have you read web site use policies on which your script applies for jobs ? Bc bots are not welcome in general for various reasons. I would say the best thing you can do is to put it on github and add it to your resume.
There are a lot(such as erewards), but I wouldn't necessarily condone this as 1) it will falsify any relevant survey and 2) it is almost certainly going to be against any website's TOS and if they catch you will lead to account/reward termination at best and a possible civil suit at worst. It's not technically illegal(at least in the US), but there can be a case made against stealing. If you were to theoretically do this, make sure your bot hides its IP through a VPN and try to "humanize" the actions your bot does.
You forgot the required parentheses around the parameter definitions. (lambda (a, b): a+b)( (2,3) )

This is pretty fucking cool - next team meeting my collegues will be flashed :D
PySimpleGUI is also an option.
I'm also learning Python while on board in stints of 3 months. As already recommended by others be sure to download the Python documentation, download all of the modules and their documentation which you will need for the book/lesson/project you're going through. I'd recommend Udemy. Really cheap and good courses (which are always on "sale") which you can download on your smartphone. Download books like Automate the Boring Stuff, and if you find some good Youtube videos try and download them. Sentdex is the first Youtube channel that comes to mind. Also, try and find a list of some exercises to solve if you want.
Fuck that. The entire ad/data sales industry is trash. Hope this guys succeeds, makes it public and these companies get what’s coming to them.

This was a gamechanger for me. One of my scripts performs a numerical optimisation which can sometimes take up to an hour. Tqdm shows me that it's still iterating and hasn't hung. Keeps me from doing a keyboard interupt and trying to tweak my parameters 
I was just saying that to cover my ass, that's why I gave the hypotheticals at the end. But if we're going that direction, I totally agree.

Ya know because they use colour and I use color.

Tkinter is old and limited in it's widget selection. The only benefit it has is that it's included in the standard library. I'd recommend Qt5 and PySide2 if you're using python 3 (they don't distribute binaries for python 2 on Windows). If you have to use python 2, you would use Qt4 and PySide. There are tons of tutorials, and a lot of the GUI can be designed visually in Qt Designer.

I come from Fortran, and the changes from Fortran 77 to Fortran 90 were huge, but old code still compiles on modern compilers. Of course, there is a lot more pressure on C and Fortran to keep backwards compatibility. Also maybe backwards compatibility is easier to implement on compiled languages (I think, but I'm not an expert on programming language development). I personally welcome the changes in 3.0, but many of my projects had to be halted or had their transition to 3.x heavily delayed while waiting for their dependencies to be updated, and that is what I dread the most about a future major update.
I completely disagree that image recognition, or even identifying cats, is solved. Why does self-driving car still disengage to the AI?

A better question is, why are you copying files using `subprocess`?
This is likely a lot easier using `shutil`. Hell, even using `bash` would be easier, faster too. 
You could also just put the right things into your IPython profile.
I was very happy with my old Apple ][+ on a monochrome green Monitor /// for many years until I saw an Amiga with the Video Toaster card installed. Nothing else in tech has ever blown my mind like seeing that for the first time.
Every regular old numpy call releases the GIL already, there is no need to reach for cython or numba unless you have a custom algorithm that can't be implemented as vectorised numpy (in which case writing it in pure python would be the main source of your speed bottleneck, not the fact that it holds the GIL) . 
I used to use mplayer with this ASCII art plugin to watch movies in this novelty mode back in like 08. Glad it's still fun.

`file` is just the file, and not the full pathname including the directory. So of course it's not finding it if it's in a sub-folder. If you do some debugging it will help to find errors like this. It's not finding the file? OK, print the filename it's looking for. Had you done that you would have seen the error. You should be using /r/learnpython for this type of question.

Can software associate one piece of information with another known piece of information? Doubtful. /s
aiohttp, flask and re
How so? It already names the objects. 
I would imagine that every class would need a distance label as well which i assume would be difficult to come by.
I made ample adjustments to [u/Kuerbiskernkeks](https://www.reddit.com/user/Kuerbiskernkeks)'s homegrown method. It uses an array of ascii chars going from dark to light and indexes them based on brightness: **"▓@╠■#§=+\~/&lt;\\"':. "\[B\*15\] # where 0&lt;=B&lt;=1 represents brightness** The parts I added were basic exposure and resolution corrections, both of which achieved by division and stuff.
Nope, it’s completely impossible to lookup data based upon other known data. /s
Glad to be obsolesced by such a formidable system :) Anyway I can get this to run on my mac?
Just speculating here but I would think it would have to update all box positions based on Field of view and the refresh rate / replacement of box are not synced so we get flashing and jittering due to dimensional approximations (not 100% placement each time).
Yeah. One potential hack is to use 2 cameras, and just triangulate the distance of the center of the objects outline. So the model would find the object, and then there would just be a calculation to find the distance by comparing the 2 cameras.
Keep an eye out for 1.2.0!
What I'm really getting at is camera based geofencing. So you specify a 3d area, and specify which object classes can and cannot enter it.
I would poop myself if that happened. @-atomsforpeace-
I would assume there's a confidence threshhold, something like "there's a 51% chance this is a mouse, and a 28% chance it's a shoe", and in that case it's marked as a mouse, but if it drops to 49% (or whatever. confidence can be expressed any number of ways), it no longer warrants marking it. there are tricks you can do with consecutive frames in video that boost the confidence of something that's already been determined that would reduce flickering, but would magnify misidentifications too.

i trashed the old idea of the long road, and made a game i really want to play, a roguelike in the same atmosphere as the original. right now the game is incredibly easy as there are only 2 levels per character, and i dont have much time, but i will continue to work on this game even if nobody but me wants to give it a go lol &amp;#x200B; no extra libraries... just pure vanilla python 3...
I've always had trouble choosing the right word to describe that black thing where I spend 70% of my time computing. I've stuck to "command line" because unlike console, shell, terminal it's not a synonym for anything (which effs up many google searches). Do you know what the difference between all these terms are?
from the title I'll admit I was expecting print('You walk a long road.') while True: input('Press ENTER to walk farther')
plus one for the screencapture hack. Great way to save time producing a gimmick you'll only actually use for a few minutes ;)
It's not a far cry away from that lol!
You could "record" it into a text file with minimal tweaking :) Play back can be done too. Let me know if you want this and I'll be happy to patch it in
Thank you
I know im going to see this on a Facebook post in 6 months saying “How algorithms are controlling everything and AI is going to rule the world”
Thanks for all the ❤️ guys &amp; gals. If you're an iTerm2 user you can use ⌘+= and ⌘+- to adjust the resolution (like browser zoom).
/s stands for "this is sarcasm" but it should've been obvious even without
Whatever startup idea you're thinking of. Yes you can do it. 
I can't thank you enough for your very detailed answer and useful tips! Finally got it!
This is correct 
Uuhhgg why call it "opencv" if you aren't going to open source the whole thing
Should've been obvious? Only to those that know the subject matter. But thanks for explaining what /s means. I was unaware of that as well.
Shouldn't it have a way to identify that? I imagine that if it identified something in an area of the image, for the next frame, the threshold for recognition should be lower in that area for that specific thing.
I was under the impression that it was pretty much a one man show, but then if it is dead and buried I don't suppose that it makes much difference :-(
I don't see why it wouldn't be possible to have a separate process running that would allow that, if you know the distances in a static 3d space. My simple mind would think just having it measure the distance from your point of reference to the first pixel a "foreign object" is in frame would work, though I'm sure there's more sophisticated methods. Please correct me if I'm being an idiot, working with images isn't my field
Thank you! Actually, it wasn't me. There's just a problem with server, trying to figure it out. 
I'm not nice to thickos who haven't a clue what they're talking about so give out completely misleading data about how to write Python. When you correct the thickos they get all upset and bleat to the thicko moderators, so I get banned for telling the truth. Hell, /r/learnpython is far worse than stackoverflow and that really is saying something. My favourite comment from the latter "Why have you downvoted my perfectly good answer?". "Because it's not the one liner the OP asked for". Jeesh :-(
Do you have a video of it in action? ( No sex action, just the machine)
Pandas doesnt look so scary. Does it have any data cleaning utilities? For example, if I need to pull from a text pdf, i use something like tabula. Then I will sometimes have a few columns stuck together, or i need to have some artifacts removed,
To learn Python I recommend [https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/tutor](https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/tutor)
Anyone still looking for a team member or looking to form a team, don't hesitate to PM me, or join this unofficial Discord server that I just made. https://discord.gg/AzUFZtn I've already solved the practice pizza problem (in Python) and would like to discuss previous rounds' problems. I know the deadline is horribly close, ideally am looking for someone who's attempted any one of the previous problems.
Typical of the questions that they ask to defeat bots is "What is four plus 5?" and there are loads more like that. Have fun trying to get around them all.
Yolo is trained on images, not video.
Argparse. You don't realize how nice it is having excellent argument parsing built in until you have to make an application in pure c++ without it.
It’s like terminator vision 
Just curious, what hardware is running this? I assume high end GPU of some kind. 
this is really cool ,,, and its cool from u to share it, thanks man 😉
I’m new as well, like two weeks. I bought a robot car from Amazon uses the Raspberry pi. Between web sites and now this robot car, I’m a full up Python student. The Pi Car-S is a cool smart car that can work with Raspberry Pi model B+, 2 model B and 3 model B+ 3 model B. So wish me luck!
Again as I and the bot have told you before, I'm going to suggest you try asking in /r/learnpython. As the rules for this sub state, **"If you are about to ask a "how do I do this in python" question, please try r/learnpython, [the Python discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/3Abzge7), or the #python IRC channel on FreeNode.** You'll want to show the code you've got and explain where you're stuck, and don't expect the sub to do your homework for you. 
Real-time vs. not real-time.
Good luck man :)
It also isn't 100% sure about the first prediction, so if a different class becomes more probable it will choose it
GPU is usually used for training the model, while as CPU is usually used for running the model. Personally, I’ve never seen Python running a model (eg Keras, Tensorflow, SSD, YOLO, et al.) with anything but CPU.
People should not that ordinary dicts are now ordered by default, please see [https://www.blog.pythonlibrary.org/2018/02/27/python-3-7-dictionaries-now-ordered/](https://www.blog.pythonlibrary.org/2018/02/27/python-3-7-dictionaries-now-ordered/)

Even though no one else has mentioned them I think OS and SYS are pretty useful 
Working on implementing a data scraping script (Self written) that will efficiently find and store NBA player statistics and then develop an algorithm to rank such players based on efficiency considering all variables and spot patterns in the way they play follow for example a blowout loss, or a narrow win. 
Pandas is like Excel in my opinion. Regarding your question, I think pandas is very efficient in data science in general. So you can clean and format your data the way you want. 
what's the difference between files.watcherExclude and a .gitignore?
Interesting

psutil
I tried it but i couldn't get its functions to work, the sensor_temperatures () function "didn't exist" and the function that should have returned the cpu temperature returned 0.0, which was wrong.
Sorry! I should have said...what you've done is very cool and it's always worth writing things if you find it fun. (Certiainly my hobby code is almost only of interest to me and replicates all kinds of things other people have done). I meant the above in the spirit of "Another cool things, which is both fun to play with and also a source of inspiration for ideas of things to code is...." So you can do things like: ``` $ gst-launch-1.0 v4l2src ! videoconvert ! fisheye ! videoconvert ! aasink ``` It looks like gstreamer also builds + runs for Mac OSX and Windows, which is something I've learnt today. https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/installing/on-mac-osx.html Have fun :-)

Me too I'm taking a python class but I want something more challanging than write a program that asks a user for x input, does simple calculation and prints the result while Y condition is true.
This is why you shouldn’t be watching porn if you do 9-5 mon-fri... we see the data all around you.
Thank you. I will do some research one these.
Not sure if this would be of help to you, but you should check out InstaPy on github, its pretty good and open source
my 2cents: create a simple web app thing using glitch.com. Here's my tutorial on how to get started: https://irumble.com/tutorials/python3
console: that's the virtual output device shell: that's the program that parses input from commands terminal: is the physical output device
[There's a demo program](https://github.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI/blob/master/DemoPrograms/Demo_Base64_Image_Encoder.py) posted on the GitHub that will convert a folder of images into base64. That's what I use to create my Base64 variables. Your icon needs to be a PNG. &amp;#x200B;
If you know what system utilities are available to get this data, you could wrap them with Plumbum. 
Excellent write-up! I don't know C and am just a novice with python, but even I was able to mostly follow. I'm curious. It's always seemed to me that to really use Cython, you need to learn all the fidly bits (which you mention and do a great job discussing). If you really need that type of performance, wouldn't it be best to just write your program in C natively? When does it benefit to have your basic code written in Python, but have a critical execution speed requirement?
Thanks 
I keep seeing these computer vision posts and think they are so cool. I'd like to throw an idea out there. Is it possible to teach it hand gestures too? Like it would be cool if a user could tell the CV to do stuff. An example would be like 1. Track a specified person or object 2. Alert me if a specified object changes 3. Take a picture whatever else seems useful.
My setup: https://enchiridion.red/2019/2/13/visual-studio-code-extensions/ A bit richer with some recommended fonts and non-Python extensions. 
Input returns a string and you are iterating the chars. Split and strip and convert to int.
Cool. Good to know. Thanks.
Thank you, I'll have a look at it and i'll see if I can use it to obtain my data.

Then you are probably using them wrong. Or your temperature sensors aren't supported. Or one of a million other things that the forums and documentation for that library can probably help with. Better yet, check out how other system monitoring tools written in python are doing it. The vast majority of them most likely have their code on github.
The advantage of Cython is in my opinion the combination of the following three (maybe I should add this to the post): - The ease with which you can write new extension modules. Without Cython, a lot of boilerplate code is necessary to bridge between Python and C. - The ease of integrating with C code, or generally C tools. You can easily use the standard C functions, such as the math ones, compiler-level extensions like OpenMP, and other libraries, which you can then integrate into Python as an extension. - Going from correct and tested code to correct, tested and fast code. You can write Python, make it Cython by renaming it whatever.pyx, and then optimize it within the annotate-profile-modify loop, all the while using the tests you wrote for the pure Python code.
I didnt even think to use sum thankyou 
I'm working on plugging holes on my Shakespeare Insult Generator, Secure Password Generator, and a Number Guessing Game programs that I wrote this week. I'm learning a lot!
datetime. I can't explain why, but on at least a weekly basis, whether it be colleagues at work, family, friends, whatever, someone needs something datetime-oriented calculated. And then I reach for a python shell, import datetime, and more often than not some incantation involving datetime.timedelta. A goddamn superpower right there.

Usually working with mnist like classifiers, you need to specify images of the exact same size (x,y) of the ones you used to train the model. 
Expected a target lock eventually 
I never use the minimap and have no need for it, but i'd miss it if i took it off.
While this is true, adding in a bit of memory seems like a logical way to make smoother image recognition in video
Hello everybody, last year I started diving in the obscure world of WSD. It's a protocol that enables network devices such as printers and scanners to be detected and instructed. Windows has obviously full support for this protocol, since it's Microsoft that contributed the most to the related RFCs. I thought to post it here to seek some testers or people interested in the project. The dream would be to complete the python implementation, develop a CLI and maybe start a C porting/binding for CUPS/SANE backends. It would be cool IMHO. 
&gt;Without Cython, a lot of boilerplate code is necessary to bridge between Python and C. Compile a DLL with: gcc -o my_lib.o lib.c gcc -shared -o my_lib.dll lib.o Then, in python: import ctypes _my_dll = ctypes.CDLL('_my_dll') To call a function: my_function = _my_dll.my_function # Tell Python what the return type is my_function.restype = ctypes.c_int # or some other type my_function.argtypes = ctypes.c_int, ctypes.c_long # or some other types my_answer = my_function(some_value_here, some_other_value)
Thank you

Very nice 
According to the benchmark given, it's faster than [https://github.com/WojciechMula/pyahocorasick](https://github.com/WojciechMula/pyahocorasick). (I haven't verified this myself.)
I'm not 100% sure if VS Code automatically removes watchers from every file in a .gitignore. So this improves performance if that is the case.
Yeah my bad. I totally forgot about the learn python sub. Thanks. 
I like it. But to add the Termanator twist you could use a laser. [Hail Skynet](https://shaneormonde.wordpress.com/2014/01/25/webcam-laser-rangefinder/)! 
This is so sick! Can you set it to only identify certain objects? Say you lose your keys somewhere and want to find them quick?
So what exactly is the purpose of having this?
That requires a recursive NN which is not part of YOLO.
I use the Intel Neural Compute Sticks a lot because they can really speed up an embedded CPU like a RasPi.
You could easily make this a cli app. That way a user can just pass in some params instead of modifying the main method for a new user or nee site
I can’t say that I’ve ever heard of, or used that. Thanks for the tip, and I’ll go check it out.
OP also try Python Principles. It worked well for me. https://pythonprinciples.com/
cool, but this would only give me the distance of the thing being lasered...
From what I see you are following the "tell don’t ask" principal. If I was to use your classes it would look like person.replenish(aPotion) That is some grade A telling. All of the necessary logic is contained in the method 
Pandas is way more efficient than Excel in many ways. Merging two datasets with hundreds of thousands rows takes seconds in pandas and half an hour in Excel, if it manages to not crash.
It doesn't have any automatic data cleaning utilities. But if your typical operations are joining or splitting columns or doing string operations, then those are easy/well supported in pandas.
That would require a different model architecture that takes multiple frames into account as input. Doing that would require datasets that are labeled in video form, which is difficult to find.
thank you :)
Anyone with experience working deeply with this and Pycharm want to comment on some of the major pros/cons of the two were for you?
thank you :)
Haha, I guess it cant happen in near future :P
At some frame, the confident for prediction is below a threshold (for example 50%) then it will not be counted as a "good" prediction, and skipped. That's why you see the flashing
Exactly ! Nice explanation
Thank you for your comment! You are right. If there is someone interested in setting up IPython profile, I recommend you to check this post (It's not mine but a nice post): https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-automatically-import-your-favorite-libraries-into-ipython-or-a-jupyter-notebook-9c69d89aa343
Yolo is not an RNN or LSTM model. In other word, there is no correlation in time between frames :)
Yes. Exactly :)
While datasets for object detection tasks for video are not too rare, I agree that it is still much less common than ones for image
Yolo is not an RNN or LSTM model :)
The one with highest probility is chosen
Yes sir :)
Your assumption about the confidence threshold is absolutely correct. Yes these tricks does exist. But it is not a part of Yolo :)
Yes, GPU NVIDIA 1070 (as I remember)
haha
A good idea. It is possible if we have suitable dataset :)
thank you :)
Hi, No in this model :)
thanksss
thank you for nice comment
thank you :)
thank you :)
Yes, if you have training data with key
Well there's the problem. Is there a similar algorithm that would handle video input better? Because of so, why not just use that?

Ok no problem
Right, I agree with your assessment. Did it stop being a mouse in the next frame?
I just use a .pythonrc file to do this?
If you want to invent sth new, first you should try to implement what already exist :)
This sounds like a fun little project. Just for entertainment, though. Maybe I'll just set it up in a VM environment. I don't want to subscribe to a cloud server when I can do this for free locally.
Actually Excel has come along way with data. Using M &amp; DAX in Power Query/Power Pivot is very powerful. 
It's also more complicated, harder to work with in production, more gpu usage, higher memory bandwidth, etc. Although everything I said can be fixed with lower level optimizations and higher level library support for said optimizations!
