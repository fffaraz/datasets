Yes, what else?
Well, even so, there are a couple reasons you would still want to use virtual environments 1) Updates to his application adding dependencies with features. This could cause issues that can be solved now instead of when they happen. 2) Version management. I dont want _OP's_ version of requests to be my globally installed one.
Not me on twitter there haha. But yeah im definitely not saying this program specifically is very bad and will cause immense pain and suffering, im just worried about name search becoming more and more developed to the point where google needs to take more action, wasting resources, in order to ensure the web isnt just a bunch of bots building advertising profiles. I like to see the posts about classifying animals from satellite imagery, i dont like how much exposure the facial recognition and web scrape posts get. Thats all really, im just picky about my own feed and temporarily justified the pickiness by saying "maybe" this kind of post shouldnt be allowed here. I think theres at least some truth to my notion that this kind of tool shouldnt fall into some teenager's hands, especially as this tool could so easily be modified to, say, find any mention of a person's name, or find any mention on the web of a town or address. Its just this kind of post makes me nervous and id rather see people posting about object recognition and baseball projections rather than web scraping and metasearch.
VIM isn't in the same ballpark as pycharm in terms of python dev. It's really only good at editing config files or something quick. There is no way to make it even comparable in terms of dev to pycharm. You will struggle for days to get vim to half of what pycharm will do for you in a few hours.
To make you a little less concerned, this program basically tries to do a direct user lookup and if it returns a 404 consider it a bust. It essentially tries to directly do www.reddit.com/u/user123 and then checks the response code, for every website down the line. It'd be pretty hard to modify this to look for someone's address. Any mention of their name can likely be more easily found using some targeted Google searches. The world we live in is scary man, I'll give you that. But I'd rather be aware of how scary it can be and how easy it is to get this information. It makes me more cautious and more careful. I like the machine learning, computer vision, data synthesis projects too. But even a simple project like this, there's something you can take away.
I wouldn't downvote this, as it to me seems obviously some sort of joke. But I have no clue what it is referring to.
[https://github.com/python/cpython/releases](https://github.com/python/cpython/releases)
I’ll look into that, thanks for the help 
some of those are release candidates. I was trying to find way to update with git clone url and do some commands like ./configure make and then make install for updating a stable. 
Additionally it should check the content of the page the see if the site gives a page but the page says 'the user was not found'.
Thank you for the suggestion my dude!!
Yes, but there are tags for every stable release as well.
Obviously! 
&gt; EDIT: found solution, exclamation point before pip (*Spyder maintainer here*) Please avoid this and follow the advice of using pip in a terminal. Our IPython console is **not** a real terminal (which is what pip expects) and that could cause several headaches and troubles for you down the road.
i was trying to imply I used the tool in question to stalk OP and had been doing so since junior high school. the name "jessie" was a name i thought vaguely resembled the username granted, it wasn't necessarily funny, so downvotes are welcome, but the responses make it clear people completely missed the point
Noticed that the json file had a duplicate in it for Houzz. Looks like the read of the json file ends up removing the duplicates, but still... There is a pull request for the updated repository, if you want to merge it in.
Why do you want to add? Just keep them in a folder. They are all .ipynb files anyway. Give them meaningful names and keep them. And when you want to use them, you can open Jupyter via terminal and use them too. 
I have been planning on doing this for some time now. Commenting to find this later. 
OSINT (open source intelligence). People are using these things recently to track ISIS (and related groups) or stuff like Twitter misinformation campaigns 
Isn't the whole point of a cheat sheet to try to shove as much on to the page as possible? For use as quick reference rather than learning.
Awh. Figured there was a joke in there and I just didnt get it. It's hard to pick up those type of jokes through text on reddit. And people LOVE to downvote. Makes em feel powerful I suppose. The stupidest shit gets downvoted, or a dissenting opinion people just downvote instead of engage. It's sad
I don't think I have update with git clone with tags for stable do you know how to do that? and how do you get python packages when using python from source through pip or the debian repos like usual? &amp;#x200B;
Hold on. What's your end goal here? 
The legitimate uses would be related to the creepy uses. It's the difference between white hat and black hat. This could be a useful tool for security audits.
Finding incorrect users on a site is still finicky.
Didn't know that! Smart use
It appears to be an inefficient update method. 
This question doesn't really make. Anaconda is a python distribution, it's a bundle of programs and tools that are useful for building python projects. What do you mean by "add existing notebooks to anaconda"?
Getting a ton of false positives with this thing.
Delete the whole last block and use eval(f‘{num1} {op} {num2}‘). Not really safe, though...
yeah I got a lot of false positives
Yes, this is very non-pythonic. The pythonic thing to do is to not use getters and setters at all. Your code should look like this: class Foo: def __init__(self, seed_val): self.value = seed_val; Nothing more is needed. However if you really insist on using getters and setters, you need to pick one. You have 2 different setters right now. Either do this: class Foo: def __init__(self, seed_val): self.value = seed_val # call the setter @property def value(self): return self._value @value.setter def value(self, value): self._value = value Or do this (less neat): class Foo: def __init__(self, seed_val): self._value = 0 self.update_value(seed_val) # call the setter @property def value(self): return self._value def update_value(self, new_value): self._value += new_value --- If you have more questions like this it's better to post them on /r/learnpython. Be sure to [format your code for reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/faq#wiki_how_do_i_format_code.3F) or use a site like pastebin. Also, include which version of python and what OS you are using. 
Look into pipenv + pyenv if you want multiple python version support. 
Isn't Docker a better solution for this issue?
Why it’s not safe 
Really? Could you make an issue on the GitHub page so that I can fix it?
Tried a username that doesn't exist on any of the sites, and got 16 hits – quite a few false positives! I'd also recommend using Colorama for colors, since as it is now, the colors don't work on Windows and instead litter the text with visible control codes.

I still don't get your point. Aren't you just describing google at this point?
Docker is super heavyweight, and although I know some people who run everything on Docker, I think its not really useful for this. I mean, it is useful if you dont trust this program, and want to sandbox it. However, I am only worried about not installing dependencies globally, which is a perfectly reasonable job for venvs.
i was inspired by this users bash script [https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/a96p59/the\_linux\_way\_of\_wishing\_christmas/](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/a96p59/the_linux_way_of_wishing_christmas/) &amp;#x200B; here it is if you wish to try it yourself [https://github.com/kevin-nel/MerryChristmas](https://github.com/kevin-nel/MerryChristmas)
Rather than checking if it returns a 404, would it be optimal if it doesn’t return status code of 200?
Can't atm for reason. You can reproduce this by using "dfsgdfgdfgdfgdf" as the username. One potential work-around, I use for a similar programm, is to parse the &lt;title&gt;someErrorGoesHere&lt;/title&gt; element. I use selenium which is much slower but offers additional functionality that you may need to properly deduct if a username is truly valid. Btw, the python source code is a bit difficult to read. I would recommend the color encoding.
Most definitely theres a lot to learn from a project like this. Im just hoping budding machine learning scientists get interested in other things besides surveillance
This is a very high exposure subreddit and im worried people will get into machine learning through this project and subsequently few engineers will be good at object recognition and physics simulation and many will be experts at surveillance and scraping together advertisement profiles.
Usually `pip3` is a small script that will call `python3 -m pip`. BUT, sometimes it hard-codes the absolute path to `python3` with a different value than you're expecting. The `-m pip` method will always work.
print("And to you too!")
What a stupid title. Why?
Worth a post to fansubber subreddits for animus and such. Cool project!
Thanks a lot for this, I will post in learnpython next time. Definitely my first thought is always to just to directly set the values, and not get bogged down in properties and setters and such. But note this example is a stripped down version of a class that has a lot of other stuff built in (e.g., validation of attributes). What I will try to do is get rid of as much of that as possible and see how much I can get away with, and post the minimal example at /r/learnpython, which still has enough detail to see the complexity. Your third code fragment is helpful even if nonpythonic: I am still learning the ropes of when I can drop the underscore, and when I can't, so that was actually really helpful on that front. 
You're right, this sub is absolute garbage.
I completely disagree! Instructions should be as simple as possible to get it working. If you already know about virtual envs then you likely know how to install this. But I will say that the install instructions are non standard
json and os are pre-installed with python anyway. And requests you pretty much should have installed globally
Friendly suggestion: don't use requiments.txt for a package. You should really deploy to pypi but otherwise you should put the requirements into the setup.py and have people clone then `pip install -e`. You might want to also consider doing adding an entry point. 
&gt; I am still learning the ropes of when I can drop the underscore, and when I can't You seem to thing the underscore is meaningful. It's not. It's just part of the name. We may as well have used the prefix "spam": class Foo: def __init__(self, seed_val): self.spamvalue = 0 self.update_value(seed_val) # call the setter @property def value(self): return self.spamvalue def update_value(self, new_value): self.spamvalue += new_value However the underscore prefix is tradition. It tells other programmers "this variable is meant for internal use, please don't touch". 
I am working on this project and unable to solve the problem. https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/a9hhy5/database_in_python/?utm_source=reddit-android
Give the full path for the Excel file and you’ll be fine. 
Yes, I understand this convention, but there seems to be one piece of magic I still don't quite get: in my original code I don't use the underscore in `__init__` but I do use it everywhere else, and this seemed to work out. However, in your third example if I do this, and drop the underscore in `__init__`, I get an attribute error because I haven't got the `@value.setter` in there. My understanding (limited as it is, from Maxwell's book on 'Powerful Python') is that dropping the underscore in the initializer actually invokes the setter. So it isn't *quite* true that it is not meaningful. Please correct me if I'm wrong, I am pretty new to this.
Wats your goal? What u ean to achive with this? Is for practice? You want to go live?
Snipping tool is great to take *A* screenshot. If you ever plan to take more than that or actually do something with the photos I would recommend installing something more functional.
Okay, so how do I do that?
Interesting topc. I probably start in www.nltk.org have fun. 
"dropping the underscore" is not a thing you should be saying. `value` and `_value` are completely different names, and as far as python is concerned they are in no way related. In your code `self.value` is the getter / setter method (depending on how it's used) and `self._value` is the actual integer storage. So when you use self.value = 0 on line 3 you are invoking the method on line 11 to run, which in turn creates and sets the name `self._value`.

Sorry I meant ain’t pyramid a better choice then Django 
This is incredibly helpful, and boy I was more confused than I thought: I now see where I was confused and will think this through more carefully going forward.
Even Java can be hard to understand for the same task. Python wins hands down in my opinion.
Looks interesting, I'll give you some feedback over the next few days.
Yep but the goal was just to take A screenshot. I'm partial to snipping tool + Gimp myself.

No, you "pretty much" shouldn't. It doesn't matter how much you use a dep, you don't need it globally like that. The only exceptions are things like numpy which can't be installed via virtualenv.
Pinterest use it apparently: https://www.quora.com/What-challenges-has-Pinterest-encountered-with-Flask/answer/Steve-Cohen
Same.
I am using pandas to access it and I have kept the file in the same folder as my other python files, even then do I need to give full path ?
A very small very bad economy simulator. It can be found on github (just look up my username).
It is difficult for me to see what the true bug is, so taking the full path will at least ensure a working app. 
If Pinterest uses it and it handles billions of request then probably I have nothing much to concern about
This doesn’t make any sense to me. Anaconda is a distribution of code you don’t want to store locally produced code anywhere near where Anaconda keeps its files. So I suspect that there is asignificant misunderstanding here. In a fact I’m not even sure if the misunderstanding is even Python related. First off you need to understand the operating system you are using and the arraingement of the file system. Understand the file system and then create one or more directories in your HOME directory to organize your files. Such a directory should allow you to access those files from any IDE, editor or Jupyter. By the way this is not just a Python /Anaconda thing, you don’t want to I’d any of your locally created software with system software or add one like Anaconda. Also I suspect that you got pushed into Anaconda before you really have reached a decent level of understanding of the operating system you are using. It helps a great deal to understand the functionality of the operating system and lower level languages before learning Python. I may be in the minority here but this is one of the reasons I think starting out people programming in Python is a bad idea. Terrible really as such an approach completely misses the basics of what is happening in an OS and how a system executes software. 
Thanks, I will try using the full path and if it works that would be great
1 - is barely a framework, is more of library that handles http request 2 - if you have a large team to put together a robuts back end (auth, db, security, etc..) yes it is a solid foundation 3 - If you are a small team or single dev, you will spend a lot of time putting basic functionality together, better options for that sceneario out there 
Might be worth checking out file permissions and ownership of the Excel file with regards to the user trying to access it within your code. Just a thought!
No please don’t do this!! Have both of you have to but having a clean requirements is a must. It allows me to easily see what is your stack and adjust it easily when I clone your repo and make changes. 
Flask is kinda crappy in production because it responds to requests synchronously. You can kinda deal with it if you spawn multiple processes with gunicorn, or if you company has lots of money to pour into additional servers/load balancers, but I'd personally recommend Tornado. Source: my team uses Flask in production and I hate it.
This also seems like a good tool to dox people with.
The term for what you're looking for is 'web scraping'. BeautifulSoup is a good library for getting data out of html documents, but it can be difficult to get data out of complex web pages (which I imagine yahoo finance probably is). You would probably have better luck finding an API that will give you stock price data in a format more amenable to programmatic access.
Mate, thanks a lot, it did work out for me !
How did you refresh it like that?
Things like zip, reduce, map, filter, etc. come from the functional programming paradigm - if the person reading the code is familiar with them, they are arguably more readable/expressive than the equivalent for loop constructs. I think most people would consider them to be pythonic, just that python beginners aren't necessarily familiar with them. The one exception is that it's often possible to express map/filter more idiomatically using comprehensions.
With the clear() command
In the code there's a while true loop running, the last step is to clear the screen immediately prior to the next loop iteration which randomly generates the tree again.
Can you send code please?
its all in a while loop and then I just clear the screen at the end (theres also a sleeo function to slow it down a bit) &amp;#x200B; from os import system, name def clear(): if name == 'nt': # check if windows _ = system('cls') else: # if *nix _ = system('clear') &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
Thank you, learnt something new today!
Glad to share. 
Thank you! I will check out BeautifulSoup and look for an API.
Thanks, you actually put me on the right track and it makes more sense now! 
The rabbithole goes deep. If live is serious i probably recomend you: https://django-shop.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

r/learnpython
A small tool to interrogate image EXIF data and to append it to the image. I work in the emergency management sector, and when we get a large job I get inundated with photos of the incident or impact. Unfortunately these are not much use unless I know where and when they were taken, and being able to visually sort and classify them will save me a heap of time.
I’m in the scenario 3. Can you recommend an alternative?
Since you are on r/python I would say \[django\]([https://www.djangoproject.com/](https://www.djangoproject.com/)) is pretty much the obvious answer. If you like to dabble with PHP, then Laravel is a good option as well, so is Rails if you like Ruby &amp;#x200B;

Where did you get the idea for this?
A little trick for stuff like that: If you don't print to stdout for every line, but write everything to an output buffer (\`output = ""\`, and instead of \`print(...)\` you use \`output += ... + '\\n'\`) beforehand, and print that to stdout (don't forget to kill the newline, you already have that in \`output\`! You can do that via \`print(output, end="")\` in Python3, \`print output,\` in Python2) for each frame, you don't get any flickering.
It's not really caused by Python. It's caused by mpiexec which is in c :)
It's just my first
Meh, I didn't bother. Btw, it's 300 level in a graduate school, so that's a PhD level class.
Thanks man, will try that next time. 😊 
I posted it as a comment here. Someone on r/Linux posted a similar thing but as a bash script. 
How could you avoid the flickering?
I disagree, single developer that has done stuff with Flask. To me it’s faster to develop a user authentication that trying to understand other framework’s way of doing stuff, plus sometimes the ways frameworks work are outdated, with Flask I cut the configuration time and focus on development.
u/CodenameLambda just gave a way of doing it above. What I did to reduce it was wait 0.2 sec before clearing the screen at the end of each loop iteration. 
You are talking as if spawning the app with gunicorn was something out of this world, when it’s a slightly longer command line than just “flask run” and gives a lot of control about the number of processes and the resources.
For such a program it doesn’t matter. But imagine that someone other than you uses the program and you do not check the variables. Someone potentially could run everything, including sys and os commands. 
oh. thats neat.
You’re explicitly meant to run Flask via a WSGI Server, not using the development server. Disliking something because using it in a way you were never meant to doesn’t work well isn’t a very good argument. 
everyone saying venv isn't wrong, but docker is also a good way to package up certain kinds of python projects. Do a `pip install -r` in the dockerfile and set your entry point to the script.
Pythontutor.com let's you do live sessions with other people looking to help. Probably harder to find someone to do this on Christmas though.
Exactly, I just used it to learn the syntax and how to write things in the python way without wasting too much time learning.
Also, code reusability is high since the creation of the Blueprints.
Look for Universal Dependency Tree and then some tools that let you use those for analysis. Producing the models is very time consuming and requires a huge corpus of data.
Interesting website, thanks. Will definitely be using it from time to time. 
I don't think you should be giving random strangers who can program full remote access to your computer. If you want to improve the quality of working code, see https://codereview.stackexchange.com/
Requirements are for scripts and setup.py is for a package. I guess you're kind of right that this is more of a script so req does make some sense. But you have the same control with setup.py and requirements
Simple scripts do not require half of the things you want help adding to yours...
You can also check latest version of 'pandas-datareader', but it seems that Yahoo (and Google) have stopped responding to stock requests some time ago for unknown reason.
Well done! That's quite the project. Consider applying your skills to contribute to an existing open source IDE. I know [Thonny](https://thonny.org/) needs a lot of help.
Not tring to be mean or rude, but it sounds to me you haven't actually worked in a real large scale application ever. None of your arguments make any sense 
Thats not what i exactly meant. Not a full blown mini shop but i very rough code of one like what i said earlier an still new to python.
I have worked in many very large banking applications (in Java), but anyways, my arguments make a lot of sense, specially for junior developers. To be productive with large frameworks, you need to spend months just to understand the configuration and the conventions. Months that with any micro framework are reduced to weeks (if so). Also, developing “basic parts” like authentication is something that you don’t need to do all the time, because you can just get a blueprint and reuse it in a hundred projects if you want. Furthermore, I have seen many times in big frameworks that they need versions and revisions in order to fix any issue on those critical parts, while those changes are a matter of days when are under your control.
Unable to take a proper screenshot or spell ”lo and behold”? I can certainly feel the ”PhD-level” quality from here \^\_\^
Maybe not on the internet, but lots of people follow it. Our company uses it as a guide and it's nice when you're working on a clean class.
FYI, you don't need to assign it to the variable _ if you're not using the return value. That's tipically done when unpacking is required like in a for loop. Also, you can use a dict and avoid ifs or a function to make that particular part clearer. TDD by example is a great book to learn about design clarity.

Which distribution is used to generate the noise? Is it statistically accurate noise or is it just for the aesthetic effect?
Ought*
You're right, people shouldn't install packages globally. I used to ignore this advice because, in my noobish ignorance, I figured it didn't *really* matter. Then one time I had a bug where our entire build system would crash if you had an incompatible version of **Sphinx** (a documentation formatting library). I will never make that mistake again.
Stop upvoting this stuff.
[Pyramid](https://trypyramid.com/) may be a good option to consider. https://pypi.org/ warehouse is built on it.
You keep track of versions by pip freezing, honestly it would be a pain to use a virtualenv for every little thing
I like how compact this is. Nice code.
Last time I tried making a request to YouTube using the requests module it wouldn't let me. I don't think you used Google's official API, so how did you circumvent this? Does YouTube-dl have a way around this?
"Pip freezing" how does that help when you're installing globally?
Unfortunately it seems people only believe you after running into version problems so many times themselves. This isn't something that be taught I guess. Hence the downvotes :|
I used a request to this site `"https://youtube.com/results?search_query` and used user input as the variable, which seemed to work fine. To download the video I just used YouTube-dl, like this ``` with youtube_dl.YoutubeDL(ydl_opts) as ydl: ydl.download([url]) ``` It might do something special behind the scenes but im not sure. I tested it on my own and I get a response 200 from `https://youtube.com` and `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbJOTdZBX1g`. Maybe something else was the problem?
I'm pretty sure you would've found out regardless, it's just a question of how much trial and error you want to put into flicker reducing. &amp;#x200B; Also: Merry christmas!
I see thanks for the response. Your script looks great, awesome work.
Thanks! 
You pip freeze it into a requirements.txt file to keep track of versions.
Wow good
anyone having trouble getting this to run? I installed "requirements.txt" but it keeps giving the error &amp;#x200B; Traceback (most recent call last): File "C:\\Users\\USER\\Desktop\\sherlock\\[sherlock.py](https://sherlock.py)", line 1, in &lt;module&gt; import requirements ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'requirements'
If you want proper async you should look at [Sanic](https://sanicframework.org/). It is a almost drop in replacement of Flask. &amp;#x200B; Although I very seldom need async, we use Flask on apache mod\_wsgi + own Flask OAuth Authentication plugin. A decent database (here Oracle). This handles easily 30K authentications/minute. it is actually limited to database write. All data is stored in/read from database which is async. I've seen apache have 5000 outstanding requests waiting for database under performance test and none failed as long as there is memory to hold the queue. Not much graphics, only a login template if bearer token is not present/expired/invalid. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
We are currently using Gunicorn 
Sanic looks pretty new though. The problem is for us clients upload huge files to us and we definitely needs a sync so we are using Gunicorn 
That doesn't fix global versioning issues.

Good bot.
it is, though in the specific case of extracting 1 column from most_common a comprehension would be just fine and possibly less brow-raising than the zip(*a) trick. top_elems = (elem for elem, count in counter.most_common(100))
I've done lots of screencasts for work.. get a Headset with a noise cancelling mic (the Microsoft LifeChat LX-3000 is a good choice and very inexpensive). Secondly, write a script: having notes and not going by the seat of your pants will make you sound a lot more professional. No need to squiggle the mouse and wiggle windows. No need to explain each piece, show us what it does and that will give you the opportunity to point out all the things you need to along the way. Looking forward to seeing the release version and testing it myself. I've been getting stuck in a Selenium project and that live preview confirming I have the right selector is going to be great! I'm available to do some testing on macOS, if the install process is not complicated ;-)

Well you can’t get stock data from yahoo, you can but it’s limited 
Time to make it real then; find an interest group; local enviro, justice, education, etc. that needs web presence, analysis, communications, or research you could volunteer as a developer. Organizations like those are sometimes underfunded and starved for programming support.

Use MySql or whatever database you prefer but I would not use Excel. I'm sure the error is because the path specified is incorrect or possibly permissions. 
Depending on how hard the problems and how soon the olympiad is you may be out of luck. Programming is not just about knowing a language, it's a mindset and thought process that can not be learned over night. 
I'm afraid I don't understand. I believe your original point was keeping track of versions in individual projects. You do that by keeping a requirements.txt file. My point was that for stuff like requests, things you probably will be using for small things all the time, don't really need to be version controlled. Sure, if you were to make a large scale project, you would create a virtualenv with a specific version of requests, but what's so bad just having it installed on your machine for small things?
Congrats, and keep at it. Those first programs feel great. Just remember when you run into a problem you can't solve don't give up. Just stop working on it and come back to it the next day. Sleeping on an issue really does help and I have woken up and known exactly how to write the code to fix my issue. 
You're missing the argument entirely. I'm not talking about actually including third party dependencies directly in your revision control system - that's called vendoring, and not only does that have its own pros and cons but it's entirely orthogonal to my point. I'm talking about the use of virtualenv vs using modules from a single, global point of installation. You cannot allow two different programs to use two different versions of a dependency if they're both managed globally. This is what virtualenv is for.
Oh I see, my bad, but I still don't understand why having requests on your machine without a venv is a bad thing.
Good bot, thanks.
One way to include a data file (or any file) with your python package, and find it again at run time wherever it gets installed, is to install from a wheel file and use the package_resources tools: https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pkg_resources.html#package-discovery-and-resource-access-using-pkg-resources
Working on a tool to convert a UTF-8 encoded CSV files to Excel xlsx so they can be opened in Excel 2016 on a Mac. Office 2016 for Mac doesn't open a CSV file correctly that is UTF-8 encoded and therefore breaks all of the French characters that are in the files I need to open. My workaround right now is to open the CSV in Libre Office and save as xslx which works, but this python script would save a little bit of time. 
For those that want to learn more about the dict, Raymond Hettingger's talk about it is really interesting. I've watched it a few times now 
Why not something like: with open('text_file.txt', 'w') as f: f.write("i love barnowls")
I really don't want to expose any ideas. But i would be using something more complex. Like opening adobe after effects, place an image, and place an mp3 within the designated folder. Export File Something like that.
There is an SDK you can use for that. https://www.adobe.io/apis/creativecloud/aftereffects.html
Agreed, it's not strange to use gunicorn. My point was that this is inherently less scalable than using an async framework.
So this would be out of the realm of python ? Would this mean i have to learn another language, and familiarize myself with it ?
Gunicorn is a WSGI server; we are not using the dev server. The issue is requests are still handled synchronously.

&gt;After Effects scripts use the Adobe ExtendScript language, which is an extended form of JavaScript used by several Adobe applications [Here is a language reference](http://blogs.adobe.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/48/files/2012/06/After-Effects-CS6-Scripting-Guide.pdf?file=2012/06/After-Effects-CS6-Scripting-Guide.pdf) If you know Python, you can figure this out with very little difficulty and have a new, marketable skill.

Unless my eyes are deceiving me that appears to be a Gruvbox theme, but in my experience [this extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=adamsome.vscode-theme-gruvbox-minor) does a much better job of tying the whole editor to one of the different Gruvbox flavors.

I understand where you're coming from, in that in lots of applications, you can't just use, say, the authentication system that comes with a framework like Django. But to say that Django takes months to learn how to use versus implementing something like user authentication in a more minimalist environment has always seemed to be a poor argument. I've worked at places that would rather implement everything themselves, and use a minimal framework. Thing is, it's usually done very poorly. Why would you implement something yourself if you don't need to? If you don't specifically need to implement your own user authentication, why would you roll your own versus using authentication using reliable algorithms from a trusted project with auditable code? I'd honestly like to know from your point of view for more information 
You may want to consider something like Shopify, I understand the desire to create your own solution and I wholeheartedly support it, but there are so many considerations when creating your own shopping platform. Now that you're processing payments, you need to take extra steps to secure sensitive information. Want to process credit cards? Be prepared to pass your PCI audits, or integrate with a payment platform that handles this for you. That's not to say that these extra steps don't need to be taken in other types of projects. The PCI requirements could easily just be recommended for any project, just for peace of mind, but now you've got to observe them for very good reason. I wish you the best and hope you find the best solution for your situation, whether it be rolling your own or expanding on an existing solution

Bootcampimg! Making a restful crud app in Django with homemade SASS and HTML. Its an issue tracker and the issues appear as post-it notes of varying colors. The HTML wireframe and models are done and I'm just working on CRUDing a dozen pages or so.

The point of getters and setters is that some computation needs to be done before the value is assigned. For instance: class Circle: def __init__(self, radius): self._radius = radius self.area = pi * radius * radius Now you can see that if we update self._radius, self.area won't update. That's the purpose of a setter, usually -- to do some extra work. So we make raidius into @property radius and radius.setter have some code to update the area again. Your code isn't doing anything like that so you should avoid @property. Unless it's homework, then go for it. But yeah, update_value is not needed -- that's literally what a setter does.

Generally mom and pop shops as anything else (even entry level) requires ti to have a degree or be enrolled in college to apply. Google is an example, just being an intern requires college, or it's instant rejection. So, coding would likely not be the primary part of your work. I recommend taking with the tech department head of your school, they sometimes enlist kids in tech care where you can gather work experience and use your coding skills for pay (albeit below minimum wage because you have no degree yet, unless you graduated in 3 years). That's basically how it goes...
Done, Thank you !
You shouldn't comment on things if you don't have any idea what you are talking about.

Yeah its not very clean code. Where would you suggest placing that statement?

Thank you! I've been looking for a better one. 
Hi, it looks like you have a great basis for further learning. If you want to be a frontend dev, you should focus heavily on Javascript. Do you know a framework like Angular or React? If not, you may want to pick up one of those two. Finally, I'd offer some perspective on your thought that you "know a lot". I'm coming to the end of a four year degree in computer science but would very much so consider myself a beginner. What you have is a great start, but always beware of the Dunning-Kreuger effect. Good luck and make sure to build a lot!

Depends on what you mean by "know" a language. If all you can do is follow python tutorial, or write some basic Java then you won't find any job. For a front-end dev you need a portfolio of sites and completed projects.
Thanks
So you understand my point, it comes from experience. In those banking web apps, we were considering 3-6 months time for a junior developer to be fully productive inside the project. It wasn’t Django, it was Java + Spring (with all the bells and whistles, like ORM and so on). For example, I am really faster typing SQL queries with prepared statements with a description of the database than using Hibernate. I still have nightmares in which a huge web.xml appears. Also, if you follow good practices (OWASP is a good starting point), implementing those ready-made things is not that difficult and, in case of a security problem you don’t have to wait until a new release comes up (usually big organizations only like stable, long term support releases).
I like micro frameworks, but, as you see, it depends. TBH, there are good arguments on both sides.
Are you spawning the app with only one worker process or am I totally lost?
That's awesome discipline. I am proud of you. 
 if op != 'sents' or 'words': This does not do what you think it does. `'words'` always evaluates to `True`. Check out [this SO answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/15112149/4570170). TLDR: you line is interpreted as if (op != 'sents') or ('words'):
That’s not a light statement. Before Node.js everyone was assuming so, now nobody is really sure that threaded servers are more scalable than single threaded ones.
Usually without a degree you won't land a single interview. However, what could help you is building a portfolio on what you have been developing. Your own github account should present some interesting solutions / libraries, being a contributor to open source technologies might also help. But be realistic, there are a lot of ppl who can code and have a degree so make yourself unique.

I'm not familiar with LiClipse, but you can look at PyQt5 or simplePyGUI if you want to do UI stuff. Though the "normal" way is starting with terminal apps

This is brilliant! I tried it on a video where the subs were from a DVDRip and the movie from a WebDL. Initially they were totally out of sync but after applying `srtsync` they were perfectly synchronised! One suggestion: should `webrtcvad` be added to `install_requires` in `setup.py`? I was caught by surprise when I had to install it separately. I know it's not a hard dependency but if most users will want it, it might make sense to include it by default.
check out exercism.io I think it could help out in this instance 
Happy to see you satisfied ! I removed webrtcvad from the hard dependencies yesterday, but I think your are right, I should put it back.
All the bitches love my mad python skills. 
Ha ha... Never asked !! But why not...
Where are you from?
If you really know all these, you can do a lot more than front-end dev. A lot of the comments here say you need a degree and while I definitely do suggest more education^1, I'm not sure I agree with them. If you work on open source projects, for instance, you can get enough experience to get some interviews. ^1 Software engineering is about a LOT more than just knowing some languages. That's really the least of it. After you learn a few, I expect a software engineer to be able to pick up a new language in maybe a week, at least well enough to make something work, if not be fluent and idiomatic in that language.

If you are generating a black/white noise GIF, we simply use random draws from the [0,1] uniform distribution and select white if x &lt;= 0.5 and black otherwise. The random color is selected using python's random.choice function which is documented [here](https://docs.python.org/2/library/random.html). The general goal is visual, so the exact distribution of the noise isn't as important as its appearance, but this could be easily modified for purpose.

A singleton is a form of global state. This is a perfectly reasonable way to translate the Singleton pattern to Python, especially if you're writing an application rather than a library.
I liked it, thanks. 
thankyou it helped me alot 
Sorry you've had bad experiences, I cannot relate. PEP8 has made my job easier as a developer interfacing with other developers, and open-source modules. Where I see code NOT conforming seems to be more in the data science space, and Python 2. Auditing this code is more difficult for a number of reasons. I'm happy that my organization not only encourages, but enforces coding standards such as PEP 8 (Python) and PSR-2 (PHP) enforced by git pre-commit hooks, and the CI server. Sure there are *some* rules that we ignore (such as lines too long), but the majority only help us. Outside of ignoring some rules, I'm not sure how not conforming to code style standards benefits an organization or individual.
I see. Should I change it to `REUSABLE_OBJECT` like Pylint suggests to 'mark' it as 'wish-to-be' constant? or because it's not a real constant anyway I should just leave it all lower case?
I had started a similar one that would sync a sub but abandoned it pretty fast 😂. Happy you made it, I will check!

&gt; People who say this and won't let you write a dirty script in Python to get a job done in 5 minutes and instead want an enterprise solution in an enterprise language are the same people that will breeze right through a C# code review where you've declared all your variables as vars and use Dictionary&lt;string, dynamic&gt; instead of structs or objects. "Looks great! Ship it!" This statement is so true. They attack the language even though the 5 minute script in Python would be infinitely more maintainable (even if it's only because it's one file and less than 100 lines), yet give their approval on incredibly questionable Java code. Simply because 'Java' is an accepted enterprise word, and 'Python' is not.
You are right, I think I would add those and commit them. 
We are spawning multiple workers. Really the only point I was trying to make here was about sync vs async.
1. No. 2. Yes. 3. No. If you want an editor that supports running code regions, look into something offlike like PyCharm or VS Code.
Thank you for explaining! Cheers. 
You can delete that whole line. Python will seed when it starts up.
Yes, you do need to install it. Also, read the [tutorial](https://www.djangoproject.com/start/). Also, /r/learnpython.
If you have to work in the cloud, Python Anywhere will give you a free shell &amp; Python. If you can install locally, just get Pycharm. Unless your computer is a potato, in which case get vim or sublime.
I know nothing about Repl.it. But I use Emacs to write Python. Evaluating expressions in Python mode is bound to `C-x e`, so that part is covered. You have also all sorts of `python-shell-send-*` commands, so you can send defun / file / region, they also have some default bindings. `eply` adds few more features and integrates with `pyvenv`, so you can have multiple versions of Python interpreter open at the same time (don't underestimate this ability, compatibility in Python world is a hell, and you really need to keep tabs on it if you are writing real programs). There's also an OK-ish interface with `pdb`, but I rarely use GUD. the integration is sub-par when compared to SLIME.
Thank you 🙂

I’m Gary Burch, one of the software developers with Open Law Library ([http://www.openlawlib.org/](http://www.openlawlib.org/)). We needed our VS Code extension, Codify, to communicate with our codification engine (basically a compiler for laws) which is written in Python. So we needed a native Python language server. We found Palantir's excellent python-language-server, but instead of targeting Python directly, we needed one targeting legal XML. Basically, we needed a pythonic generic language server. Thus was born, pygls (pronounced like "pie glass"). &amp;#x200B; Our goal with pygls is to make it incredibly easy for anybody to write a language server for anything in Python. We have created a thin pythonic layer over the Language Server Protocol - giving the developer the core of what they need without getting in the way. Currently, it targets Python 3.5+ and has support for sync, async and threaded (using an @thread decorator) features and commands. &amp;#x200B; Python is one of our favorite languages, and VS Code one of our favorite editors. We hope pygls will make it possible for people to build many new and exciting language servers that leverage the power, ecosystem, and flexibility of Python. &amp;#x200B; This wouldn't be possible without Daniel Elero's hard work. Thank you, Daniel!
OK, so does the random.randint function have a default seed if none was provided? 
Thanks all for the feedback. Among the reasons for picking [Repl.it](https://Repl.it) is it's a cloud IDE and I use only Chrome OS on the desktop.

Ok that's perfect because you can use Selenium. You can also use Selenium from Python I think.
since we are in r/python, django is the obvious answer 
Yes, I checked Selenium, I think that it's good for my job. I've seen that it can also be implemented in python, which could be good for working in concomitance with my old script
Probably. Is this an open source project and/or something you work on with a team? In that case it's usually a good idea to keep to a style guide. If the code is just for your eyes, I'd say use conventions that make sense to you personally, and the choice whether or not Singleton-ish objects count as constants is up to you.
Woah.. this rocks. thanks!!
Well, it is on some level. I have couple of test files. Each use this object to access configuration details. So all tests will be using those. If I set it to Global, I still need to specifically import it? or Globals are accessible without it?
Well, both me and my team use it. All our Tests using some configuration details. All tests files should have access to this file. So in that case, I guess it should be a GLOBAL? and if it's a global, do I need to import it?
Thanks, /u/-mrd\-, for posting. &amp;#x200B; A little back-story ... &amp;#x200B; I’m one of the software developers with Open Law Library ([http://www.openlawlib.org/](http://www.openlawlib.org/)). We needed our VS Code extension, Codify, to communicate with our codification engine (basically a compiler for laws) which is written in Python. So we needed a native Python language server. We found Palantir's excellent python-language-server, but instead of targeting Python directly, we needed one targeting legal XML. Basically, we needed a pythonic generic language server. Thus was born, pygls (pronounced like "pie glass"). &amp;#x200B; Our goal with pygls is to make it incredibly easy for anybody to write a language server for anything in Python. We have created a thin pythonic layer over the Language Server Protocol - giving the developer the core of what they need without getting in the way. Currently, it targets Python 3.5+ and has support for sync, async and threaded (using an @thread decorator) features and commands. &amp;#x200B; Python is one of our favorite languages, and VS Code one of our favorite editors. We hope pygls will make it possible for people to build many new and exciting language servers that leverage the power, ecosystem, and flexibility of Python. &amp;#x200B; This wouldn't be possible without Daniel Elero's hard work. Thank you, Daniel! 
Being a beginner, I'm working on writing a text based RPG Game (Like the MUDs of old) Just to get experience with creating random maps, and random encounters. Nerdy to the max! But great practice (I think) at implementing all the basics I've been learning.
Nice cheatsheet but really such word semantics with *&lt;&gt;* signs are hardly readable index = &lt;list&gt;.index(&lt;el&gt;)

This is awesome, thank you
Things I believe would hugely improve this sub: 1. Only self posts - This is a very common subreddit rule and doesn't need further explanation. 2. Strictly enforce /r/learnpython rule - It's a good rule but this sub is still flooded with these types of posts. 3. Implement stricter rules against noobie content and low effort posts - We don't need any more of this crap: * I just started Python look at this bullshit 10 line script I made! * Look I made Hello World! * Look at this re-skinned Django setup tutorial * The ten thousandth basic Pandas tutorial. * " Jupyter Notebooks tutorial. * Any and all arts &amp; crafts ("I made a needlepoint Python logo!").
Great!
Me, scrolling: Well that's nice but what about-- oh, there it is. Thanks, OP 
Best Xmas gift if the season!
Helpful resource, thanks!
fare enough:)
If we read the books, why would we need a cheatsheet?

Something like this? [https://engineersportal.com/blog/2018/9/13/audio-processing-in-python-part-i-sampling-and-the-fast-fourier-transform](https://engineersportal.com/blog/2018/9/13/audio-processing-in-python-part-i-sampling-and-the-fast-fourier-transform) &amp;#x200B;
Awesome, I just started learning Python, this definitely helps me a lot. Thanks !
I think they mean more that regex's complexity is better suited to full books vs cheatsheets?
If you know the basics, the best thing you can do is write programs. Get an idea and try to do it. If you need a library, check out the standard library first.

Okay. didnt know , anyway I post last week on visualbasic window and I got many answers
Maybe some sort of syntax highlighting instead? And just use "list" and "element" (I didn't like the &lt;el&gt; in particular, as I had to pause for a moment to figure it out)
I found it significantly more readable with the syntax highlighting on github: [https://github.com/gto76/python-cheatsheet](https://github.com/gto76/python-cheatsheet) &amp;#x200B;
Great! I will certainly use it. Would you consider adding '''finally''' to try/except?
&gt; I found that removing/renameing the socket.py can help, but it did not. _Which_ socket.py did you rename? The problem is (most probably) that due to Python's very stupid module system _your_ file called socket.py can shadow system file with the same name, so you have to rename your file. Do `import socket; print(socket.__file__)` and see which it is. It should be in the same `C:\Users\Tomi\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python37-32\lib` directory.
This might prove to be really useful for a project I'm developing, a compiler for a toy language written with Python and LLVM. https://github.com/syegulalp/Akilang My original plan was to implement the LSP manually, but having a library to do it is a great time- and effort-saver.
There is an awesome library in python called "scrapy". I recommend it for web-scraping.

Hey! Thanks for checking it out and providing feedback. Really helpful. I'm still glad I got it uploaded as it lets me refine over time. Completely new to video stuff. The next video will be more precise on content, and I'll create notes before hand. Also the note on professionalism, that's great. I am pretty casual so focusing on that for the videos will be great. About the application, it's definitely not a standard test automation tool. I started it a few months ago and after looking at what's out there and what is recommended structure wise I basically said 'why.' So it's customized a lot in terms of the structure. All the assertions, database entries, and logic are on the backend so the scripts you make are just the element calls. I wanted it as simple as possible for our testers here (they don't script). But it ended up being flexible, easy to use, and pretty fast. I came into work today and one tester did four extra scripts. He clicked a button and it went through those four in less than 30 seconds. The way I'm passing the scripts into the backend seems to make it very fast (we have another engineer here coding Selenium with Java for another application and it is much slower for some reason). Additionally there is a server piece that I've managed to get threaded, so those 30 seconds should be about 5. I'm not making anything spectacular but it is easy to pick up and automate stuff. Not expecting any limelight but plan to make it open source incase it helps other companies and people be able to step into it with zero cost. It's really been a lot of fun and started from just curiosity! Thanks again for the feedback and helping out. Oh also, I spun off that highlighting feature you mentioned into it's own tool a while back called EHX. There are two versions and 1.0 is stable. 1.1 has some issues from trying to support highlighting multiple elements. I've just been working on this and haven't had time to go back and fix it: https://github.com/eagleEggs/EHX
I have a few things I'd like to contribute as well. Will be working on it the next few days. Thanks for sharing!
Dive into python
Why are you giving up on VBA or hoping from it ? If you can’t “go much further” with anything Microsoft, not the least ms office, you will find it’s much less straightforward with python. I mean what exactly are you looking to achieve or you’re just learning ?
What do you mean “git is that counts”?
&gt; how did you Internets
Tried it, but did not work for me. Any ideas what went wrong? python sherlock.py File "sherlock.py", line 17 print (f"\033[37;1m[\033[91;1m-\033[37;1m]\033[91;1m {errstr}\033[93;1m {err}") ^ SyntaxError: invalid syntax 
Yeah but be aware, don’t use your personal sim. 
I don’t get it....

[Seashell](https://a9t9.com/seeshell/desktop-automation) has Python hooks, but you can probably do what you want with it's GUI without even fooling with Python.
I've been getting really into Dungeons &amp; Dragons (currently DMing my first campaign!), and decided to build a character-building assister. The general idea is that I wanted to write something that would allow me to automatically get stats/simulate the dice rolling for a new player-character. [Github Link](https://github.com/jopetersen/DnDAssister). A lot of the stuff that I'm doing is admittedly suboptimal (lots of brute forcing), but this project is meant to be a learning experience. I think I've started to get the hang of classes in python. I think I can replace the updaters with a recursive function, but I'm not entirely sure how that'd work.
Try /r/learnpython 
You could look into using Jupyter notebooks. They are amazing for getting immediate feedback as you code (including visualizations)
New Jersey USA 
Jupyter notebooks in python usually is used for throw away data science related scripts and usually is used by people who are not actual programmer( Data scientist's and people who only use python for its ML libraries). live programming and repl's are very unpopular among python dev's who wrote code in production. Unlike python repls (real "[Read–eval–print loop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop)") are popular among clojure/... devs and is integrated in the core of language. Experience of something disgusting like Jupyters is not even close to lisp. 
A read–eval–print loop (REPL), also termed an interactive toplevel or language shell, is a simple, interactive computer programming environment that takes single user inputs (i.e., single expressions), evaluates them, and returns the result to the user; a program written in a REPL environment is executed piecewise. The term is most usually used to refer to programming interfaces similar to the classic Lisp machine interactive environment. Common examples include command line shells and similar environments for programming languages, and is very characteristic of scripting languages.
`ALL_CAPS_WITH_UNDERSCORES` for constants and globals, `snake_case` for function names and variables, `CamelCase` for class names.
Thanks, I'm indeed also looking into Jupiter Notebook.
To be honest Python has one of the best docs (including an excellent tutorial) of any language and I recommend everyone learn it there. You’ll know it really in depth and can learn at your own pace.
Very useful for a student who’s asked to make a team project on ML when not seen in class! Thanks
&gt; So in that case, I guess it should be a GLOBAL? If that's the convention you and your team have decided on, definitely. &gt; and if it's a global, do I need to import it? Yes. Python doesn't have _global_ globals, they are local to the module they're assigned in.
Yeah that's the best framework for web-scraping, very powerful and robust.
A mental ward, I think.
Newlines are escaped when they're in any kind of parentheses.
K900_ has the answer. I do suggest reading PEP 8, it's very informative.
&gt; grammar that you cannot parse with stock compiler-compilers (like YACC) Are you sure? I thought you could as long as you had a lexer that generated indent and unindent tokens.

This is great. I was looking into how to make these persistent outputs onto a terminal. I learned something from your code. Thank you. By the way `outbuffer3 = ...` on line 52 has one indentation to much and is therefore evaluated every time the trunk loop is executed. Merry Christmas &amp;#x200B;
Thank you for your comment. I will patch it up soon. 
That’s amazing 
Here's a library my colleagues and I developed and use throughout the code base: https://github.com/Parquery/icontract There was also a longish discussion on python-ideas mail list about introducing contracts into the language: https://groups.google.com/forum/m/#!topic/python-ideas/JtMgpSyODTU (see also the following posts)
I’m going to sit down and start learning python. Enough research of it’s the next language to learn or not. I know basics of C and Java which I could expand upon but my future career will probably benefit more with python. 
totally agree!
&gt; With most languages, including code just includes the code ... In contrast, many Python modules include initialization functions that run during the import. In languages like Python where functions and classes are first class, defining a function or a class *is* a runtime operation, so of course something you import has to be executed. This is the same as Ruby, for example. In C, which the author appears to prefer, the runtime loading mechanism is shared libraries, and yes, exactly the same thing is possible: if an `_init` function is defined, it is executed. &gt; If you didn't know what "BeautifulSoup" did, could you tell from the name that it's an HTML/XML parser? Can you tell from their name what Nokogiri or Lagarto do? This isn't a Python problem. &gt; Python has more quirks than any other language I've ever seen Author then proceeds to give the following list of quirks 1. String delimiters &gt; Most programming languages pass function parameters by value. If the function alters the value, the results are not passed back to the calling code. But as I've already explained, Python goes out of its way to be different. Python defaults to doing functions with pass-by-object-reference parameters. This means that changing the source variable may end up changing the value. The author doesn't appear to understand this. Python is strictly pass-by-value. Those values are object references. This is the same as Java, PHP, JavaScript, Ruby etc. If the object whose reference you pass in is mutable, then of course the function can mutate it. It can't ever rebind the caller's name to another object, though, as you can in C++ and C#. The author does not understand the difference between changing the value that the caller has and mutating the object the caller has a reference to. &gt; If I have a program called "screencapture.py" that uses "import screencapture", then it will import itself rather than the system library. At minimum, you should call your local program "myscreencapture.py" instead. Don't put them in the same directory. If you have a driver script for some Python library, it goes in a directory on `$PATH` while the library goes in a directory on `$PYTHONPATH`.
This is so fucking amazing!
thats cute lol merry christmas to you too
You're welcome! I will go check on v1 of EHX ;-)
Saved. Thank You!
Try wxpython. It never disappointed me. Excellent documentation on the C bindings. If you want to get a head start with creating a layout in wxpython use wxglade. It has gone out of style in favour of QT. But that documentation is atrocious, I think.

just so I understand, you're extracting nested data from lists (h[x][0])? what type of data is this? when you do your comparison to 'MHH', you're comparing to a string. if the data you get from h[x][0] isn't a string I think the comparison will fail
forget it .. converted it to a string and put it in an 'in' statement and it works.

PySimpleGUI - [https://pysimplegui.readthedocs.io](https://pysimplegui.readthedocs.io)
If you want a dynamic environment to evaluate code I’d use the jupyter notebook over anything else. I often prototype things out in one before implementing in prod 
It might be a bad practice but I’m not a fan of the GUI options Python has: If i need a quick interface I spin up a Flask app.
I'd be alright to work with Flask. I'm just not in the mood to learn much of a framework, I know what I want to do, I know how the backend needs to work, I just need buttons and interfaces to do things.
Cool! 1.1 has cleaner code, and optimized. I’ll probably get to it later this week to fix that issue.
Yeah, it's fantastic for all kinds of callbacks as well as the functional tricks that inspired it :-)
For quick and dirty to quite complex, Kivy is pretty solid, while staying essentially within python. The kv language is super basic and essentially pseudocode.

tkinter. But that's because I already know Tk from the Tcl side and that's the library that I *know* will be available on any system I end up shipping to.
You can get your program up and running in a few minutes with PySimpleGUI. Ideal for custom and quick. 
Little project I wrote recently. It displays images in a terminal with the Ascii half block (▀) and FG/BG RGB color codes. Images are scaled before processing so that they display close to real size based on a 10pt monospace font. Gif playback defaults to frame times contained in the gif and there's an FPS override for playing gifs at a set FPS. C&amp;C welcome.
if you write some skeletons and frameworks it can be much easier to use.
Thanks! :) Didn't know this tbh
As someone closing in on 30 years of experience, I find this short-sighted, slightly idiotic, and a bit offensive. Young programmers are often in an "always be coding" mindset, which is great. But at some point, a few truths sink in - such as the one that says that not writing code is often the best solution; or simply that you have been in a similar solution before, and all those things you thought you should be doing turned out to be wrong. That doesn't mean you have "lost that light", it just means that you have gathered more experience, insight, and maybe even wisdom. A great team has both - overly enthusiatic juniors who have code pouring from all orifices, and experienced seniors to guide them and steer clear of the most blatant death traps. And yes, a certain degree of disillusionment, and maybe even cynicism, is part of growing up as a developer. Some of us are better for it, others are broken in the process. But that's all completely irrelevant because apparently I'm arguing against an idiotic sales pitch for a product that I can only assume is at least as idiotic.
Nice! I find that coding in python is often faster than coding in C as there's less formatting required but then again, the formatting makes it much easier to wrap my head around large chunks of code.
Just tried your sim. Keks were had. Could probably be improved by more extreme increases/decreases from actions rather than really really small changes and not having more than 4 decimal places.
my words sting your soul buddy. i can feel your in pain.

What the fuck?
To be fair, I’ve met both sides of this spectrum in experienced older coders. It’s either they don’t think you’ll make something that becomes anything and frankly don’t understand some of your methods used as it doesn’t ‘fit the documentation’ for the language; syntax, code style, etc always looking at basic things to find wrong with what you’re doing. And then the side that is just positive about coding in general, see it as an art, and encourages and contributes to your progress despite mundane textbook requirements that you’re not following, sees the functionality that you’ve made and doesn’t care how you got it done as it does what you say it does, if it works it works. But this is how everything works, from the full spectrum and in between for literally everything in life.
Thanks for sharing. I often split strings and miss the functionality of operating on resulting lists. However, it seems you just use python lambdas which does not take advantage of c extensions speedups. I wonder how difficult would be to extend the types by the typed sets so these set operations can be implemented efficiently.

You might want to take a look at PyPDF2. I used this for a project a few years ago, just simple text extraction, and found it useful. [GitHub - mstamy2/PyPDF2: A utility to read and write PDFs with Python](https://github.com/mstamy2/PyPDF2) He also has a PyPDF3 which I haven't used, and on a quick glance don't see what the improvements are over PyPDF2. I don't know if the library gives you access to the document elements at the level you're asking about, but its source code would show how to traverse documents and maybe come up with that info. I imagine some work towards understanding the structure of a PDF file will be necessary.

Nest two for loops
The script needs to be run using the virtual environment as well. Did you try creating a Python file and running that to see what it does? For example create main.py and just add the import statement and one print statement for testing. Without using \`pipenv run\` if you were to run the script using python main.py It should fail. But if you run pipenv run python main.py It should run successfully. You need to have the service call the Python executable in that virtualenv's directory. You should be able to find that by running pipenv --venv

Probably not the best way to go about it, but I think this works. temp=input("enter temp ").strip().upper() if(temp=="HOT"): print("it's hot") 
`input` returns a string. if you want to compare it to an int, as the error message suggests, you need to convert it to int first, using the `int` function.

Input returns a string and you are testing it as an integer. Try age2=int(input ("Enter age ")) This converts the string input gives you to an integer so that you can do number related operations. It's called type casting.
It worked, Thank you both. &amp;#x200B;
You're right, SQLite would be a better alternative compared to several CSV files.
Thank you so much. I have printed this out, taped it to my blow up doll and had sex with it. 
Yes,it's working,Thanks a lot

Yes , for now I focused only on the API part - it's just syntactic sugar one could say. The internal implementation of SetMethods is supposed to change. The empty functions (e.g. def set_intersection) are supposed to be vectorized implementations, to be wrapped by SetMethods' methods. I'm designing a future release changing the implementation. Having said that I haven't seen around too many vectorized operations involving sets. Pointers are welcome.

Not op but I've "written" quite a bit of programs in pythons that are used at my job but to be honest I googled almost all of them but didn't necessarily follow a tutorial. Do I need to get to the point to where I stop googling to say I've learned python enough to get a job just programming?
Thank you!

Yes that is very possible. 
Could you please explain how or give me a couple libraries to work with? I’ve never used the combo of the bluetooth socket programming and python! Thx man~
Some are great mentors, some are not, and you don't automatically learn it with experience. Finding the right balance between encouraging someone and nurturing their passion, vs. keeping them on the right track and steering them clear of the abyss, all the while remembering what it was like for you, isn't necessarily something that comes naturally.
Dude, you seem kind of supercilious 
Check permissions. Apache user (www-data) must have read and execute access to directories. 
Nope, you cannot: though I don't really understand what do you mean when you say indented and unindented tokens: two token streams? If so, how would this help? But, an easier way to think about this problem is this: think about the time when you had to write multi-line Python code into interpreter's shell: it doesn't know when you are done writing. Sometimes it can guess, like, if you used a `return` at the highest indentation level, but for the most part it just waits for you to send two newlines, which it interprets as "I'm done typing". So, essentially, it parses Python code incorrectly (there's no reason you shouldn't be able to insert empty lines in your program), but it kinda works... like most things in Python, it works for the 80% of cases...

Yeah... it's a lot of boilerplate but you can do it. This is where it gives some examples: https://docs.python.org/3/extending/newtypes_tutorial.html but, really, it's a rabbit hole you don't want to go down. Better create a C interface where you don't have objects that are difficult to allocate and / or free (eg. integers, or character arrays at most), and write classes in Python call those functions. It might seem like a bizarre work around at start, but, trust me, this is much simpler and reliable than having Python allocate and free your objects. Also, you'll keep more of your code in C, where you can execute it in parallel or do some other optimizations not available in Python.

A lot of your posting history is just you asking people to figure out stuff for you.

Look at the output of `configure`: you are probably missing some headers, like `libffi`, `libsqlite` and so on.
Yes, and I understood that after a small moment, but it didn't seem naturally flowing. I would have prepared "element". 
Unless you are writing Python's standard library, where classes can be all lowercase, functions can be camel-case, or pascal-case, globals can be lowercase and so on. PEP8 is for plebs.
Well, dealing with Python infrastructure can be overwhelming. Especially since the task it needs to accomplish in every particular case is really simple, much simpler than your dealing with the infrastructure... But there's a bright side to it, since you are installing on Pi, you don't need any of `pipenv`, `venv`, `virtualenv`, `pip`, `pypi` and friends! If you have reasonably few packages, you can just come up with a shell script that will copy their source code like this: site_packages=$(python -c "import site; print(site.getsitepackages()[0])") for packages in $your_packages ; do cp -r $package $site_packages done And that's really all you need.

That's a homework. Show us your code and say where you have a problem.
I second PyQt. If anything, Qt is a thing on its own and any time a library is beyond languages is a plus in my book.
I would like to share pretty standard multivariant Kalman filter setup used for multiple object indexing. Code can be found here: [https://github.com/dghy/object\_indexer](https://github.com/dghy/object_indexer). As an input, it takes json data (formated txt file) with previously detected objects. Required format of the detection data can be found in the project documentation. As an output, user gets objects positions with unique indexes. For example it's possible to plot each object individually or count position correlation between selected objects. Moreover, Kalman filter tries to estimate objects positions in cases where detection data is absent. It performs OK for a few frames but if data is absent for a longer period of time the estimated positions start to drift away. That's why user can set up his own parameters (e.x. number of frames that estimation should be performed without detection data) and try to fit the filter to his own needs as well as possible. Detection data used in examples below was produced with ML detection algorithm (people and cars detection). Video examples of working program can be found here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvRgnzNIMQk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvRgnzNIMQk) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNZ6QWIGafw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNZ6QWIGafw) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjMfeX9PHRc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjMfeX9PHRc) Tell me what you think :)
Definitely going to have to try it out. I've worked with pointclouds in Python before and I found viewing the clouds difficult. Last time I ended up using matplotlib, which of course choked on clouds &lt; 50'000 points large. &amp;#x200B; Also nice to see something interesting come out of HERE, only interaction I've had with them before was trying to update the satnav in a Ford, which was an exercise in frustration.
Well said!
I tried a few from [https://docs.python-guide.org/scenarios/gui/](https://docs.python-guide.org/scenarios/gui/) . Ended up using PySimpleGUI. 
The first part, yes. On chrome or chromium based browsers you have custom engines so you can add an engine to search directly on youtube. &amp;#x200B; The second, I don' know but I guess is not possible to do it via URL.

Really good read! As someone trying to learn python for optimization problems - I really liked your animations. I was slightly bummed when I didn’t see the code anywhere. Thanks for sharing otherwise!
Not sure if I'd agree with that, there _is_ a learning curve to Kivy and in my experience whether it's steep or not is really dependent on what kind of project you're making, and I don't just mean the complexity. Granted, I last used it quite some time ago.
I’m not sure of an API, but you can search YouTube using a search string in the URL: https://youtube.com/results?search_query=FooBar You could easily select the first video by scraping the resulting web page.
thanks. I plan to start own online course and I'm sure this Cheatsheet will be widely using in that course. 
But learn to use Qt Designer so you can subclass all your boilerplate UI code and just have to write your logic.
A CSV parsing translator. It's going to be used for news reports, tweets, reddit posts and the likes. &amp;#x200B; Although it's working nicely, I've been struggling for the past 3 hours with Google's bot detection mechanism, which has cut me off from their translate API.

I would go with PyQt and learn to use QT designer, then all you have to do is subclass your ui and just have to write the application logic.
Here's a rough script I wrote years ago that should get you started in the right direction: import requests from bs4 import BeautifulSoup def get_href(url): response = requests.get(url) content = response.content soup = BeautifulSoup(content, "lxml") # Get all the links to videos, because the first might be an ad tag = [a['href'] for a in soup.find_all("a", {'class', 'yt-uix-tile-link'}, text=True)] return tag def search(query): search_url = 'https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=' yt_link = 'http://www.youtube.com' this_search = "+".join(query.strip().split()) divs = get_href(search_url+this_search) # sometimes the first is an ad and ads start with "https" whereas genuine video links are like "/watch?v=ElhBT-p7y70" if "https" not in divs[0]: link_ext = divs[0] else: link_ext = divs[1] complete_link = yt_link+link_ext return complete_link print(search("poop"))

While PEP8 fanboys are getting angrier, here's the bitter truth: 1. There's no difference between variables' and functions', so, if you try to make this difference explicit, you will run into situation where nobody knows what you are talking about. Consider this: class X: foo = lambda x: x @property def bar(self): return self.foo.__get__(self, type(self)) Now, the question for the geniuses who have simple answers to your question: is `X().bar` a function? 2. There is no difference between classes and functions. In fact, classes are implemented as a bunch of functions. So, whether you do `FooBar()` or `foo_bar()` the interpreter doesn't know the difference. It's pointless to emphasize it. 3. There are no constants in Python in the same sense as they are, say, in C++. There are only variables. There are self-evaluating expressions, which are often implemented as constants (eg. `"foo"` could be a constant, but isn't necessarily a constant, but from your perspective as a Python programmer it kind of is (you don't even have a legal way of changing its value). So, whoever tells you to spell Python constants in any particular case doesn't know the language all too well.
Small criticism / ideas: For string formatting, there is also sign that can be added, like: "{:+}".format(4) That gives: "+4" In [attributes](https://github.com/gto76/python-cheatsheet#attributes) part indentation is messed up for class Z. Other than that looks good.
This needs to be on r/learnpython and for further help, you need to provide any code you have, any errors you have, or at least, a more specific question than how you do this. You mentioned it's not homework, but we still believe in helping you learn, rather than just providing the answer You don't need any nested loops, just one will suffice. For each iteration, starting at one, you'll add a sub-list to your list containing the three a, b, and c elements. A, b, and c will have the iteration number appended to the string. Now translate that pseudo code into python.
If it's not a homework, then it's some other assignment. Either way, you are supposed to do it by yourself. We can help if you have a specific problem, but we won't do entire exercise for you.
Do you know coding? If yes then go to fast.ai If you don't then learn python first. 
Nice idea, look very useful in many situations. Presumably this is syntactic sugar for ``.apply``, so a bit slow on large date sets? Could a idea be to implement it similar to ``Categorical.codes``, but where each bit in a single code would represent an object's location in ``.categories``? Presumably then many set operations could be be implemented efficiently as bit operations. 
Im pretty good at Python, i just dont know where to start with such things ^^
I’ve tried it out. For its two main uses it’s awesome. The design patterns are also really well written. 
This looks great. Thanks for the dataset. 
Fast.ai will be a good place to start. Deeplearning.ai by Andrew NG is also an option. Both use a bit different approach. Andrew NG starts from basics. Fast.ai goes top to bottom(I think ) . 
nice, can you get displayed text on another application when someone would hover it w/ mouse ?
Yes, you're right. it's generally supposed to be syntactic sugar. The implementation will change (become more vectorized) at some point without affecting the API as-is. Haven't run exhaustive performance tests, but IMHO such set-like columns usually appear in the later stage of preprocessing/reporting hence so I'm not sure how much of a problem this is - realistically speaking. &amp;#x200B; I'm not sure I get the scenarion you're describing with `Categorical`
Thanks a lot! I did a couple other articles on optimization stuff, because I took the coursera discrete optimization course a while ago (which I highly recommend!). Ahhh dang you're right! I always forget to. I'll go back and edit it, thanks!

.NET Framework for windows for one...
Speed. However, my experience with most C flavors is that unless you have prebuilt libraries, C is code verbose. Python while slower (Interpreted), is easier with the multitude of libraries such make choosing much easier and quicker. 
C# benefits from its access to all .NET libraries which makes it usable for a range of things, and this also means it can somewhat easily be used in tandem with other .NET languages, most notably F#. C# code generally runs way faster than Python code, while being easier to use than C, C++ or Rust. In other words, it's a good compromise between development time and runtime performance, if the latter is fairly important. C# is also very well documented and is relatively easy to pick up regardless of one's first language.
I would recommand to start on Andrew Trask blog: http://iamtrask.github.io/2015/07/12/basic-python-network/ 
Functionally, there isn't much you can do in one that you can't do in the other. Without making use of domain-specific tools, C# will probably yield faster runtime performance for cpu-bound tasks. The real advantage C# has, though, is platform reach. Between Xamarin and Unity, you can use C# to create a wide variety of applications on a wider variety of platforms. It's not a C#-specific strength, but it is an advantage it has over Python. Beyond those, it's not really fair to compare the two. One is a highly dynamic and flexible language, and the other is a very structured and rigid language. Neither are the most dynamic or most rigid, but the styles pervade the design philosophy of software written in them. What that means, in the end, is up to you.

Damn this kid's 13.
Thanks! I fixed the Z class, although that is the way interpreter formats your second level of indentation, that is if you type it in... it's kind of weird, but since it's Python, I'm sure there's some smart reason why :) About the format, I added it, but then started reformatting the whole section, so it's a mess now... Got to think it through.
How is IronPython coming along? Doesnt that allow us access to the .NET platform /u/Diapolo10 ? /u/ipuntonfirstdown /u/the_hoser ?
Very interesting. Kinda pisses me off, that hes 10 years younger than me and knows 10x as much regarding this topic.
Then you might really want to use Flask. It's a "micro framework" so theres very little setup and you can get moving stuff fast. If you know any HTML, you can get buttons and text boxes with functionality on the screen fast.
IronPython is coming along, but currently only supports Python 2. I haven't been actively following its development, but I believe it's not going to get Python 3 support any time soon with the current development speed.
Do you have another job already? Don’t leave your job for this dream. Keep your job where you can continue refining your skills and wait until you find a job you want while you are still working.
Could the mods write a script to auto-downvote all new posts? Maybe not. 
I’m in the same boat, but my job is ending without my input really. No CS background, self-teaching a LOT, basically the office “IT” guy (we don’t have one), but have worked previous jobs that were computer/software heavy. If you don’t have to leave your current job, don’t. Go as far as you can into programming/developing while you have a job. Refine your skills. Get certified if you can (they can be kinda pricey, but way cheaper than going back to school and getting a degree). Then, start looking for a new job. Companies typically won’t hire you if you aren’t fluent in at least one language first. 
Getting the first job is always irritatingly cumbersome because of the broken recruitment process. If you really want to get in and don't have the finances/time to go get the degree, you can pursue a coding bootcamp. Even then it might not help much given the bulk of applicants. So post that, you have two options: join a "shady" consultant company where most recruites are from india/asia advertising H1B sponsorship. Even if you don't need it, those are the ones you would want to look for. That's because they forge resumes and references to place you on a project. You won't go to jail if you get caught, the background check just looks for convictions. You can also make the process safer by targetting projects/contracts on cities where it's illegal to ask prospect employees compensation/w2 proof. Be warned, these companies typically work with .net tech, which is mostly used on corporate environments. The problem here is their filter recruitment procedure is done by people who don't know tech, so they can't spot competency by other than looking at number of years you've worked in the industry. So i would suggest to look for a company that places you with python development. It's popular with startups, where the people usually interviewing you know tech so can have a batter assessment of your skills. Stick with that company until your contract is up (with shady consultant company - if you leave before you have to pay them stupid money). When shady consultant company contract is up, go on dice/linkedin/indeed/stackOverflow/monster and apply everywhere (300+ applications). Write up resume semi real (just do 2 years max of software dev industry time). When getting interviewed for new companies and they ask why you're leaving just say: "i was contracting but my contract finished, so i need to look for next opportunity. But i am pursuing a full time position as contracting wasn't for me, and would like to fully integrate with a community." ^ your second option is to do coding bootcamp, create flash github projects (ecomers websites), don't lie on resume, and apply everywhere. This will be harder though (probably 1+ years without work). Either way, always apply around february and october. Department finances are done during that time so they look for new hires. 
Stop spamming this shit please.
&gt; What I want to say is if Python would borrow this "feature" from languages like Rust or C++ we could make a huge step forward That would be actually more like jumping back from a cliff. Types have been around since Algol. The idea that computer may figure them out from context came a little later, but not much later, but still later. Python, unbeknownst to its authors, builds on a long tradition of making the language more general and more meaningful, which means, beside other things, moving away from specifying things like storage capacity necessary for your variable or writing down logical assertions about parts of the program your computer should be able to figure out correctness of on its own. &gt; The async stuff has ported Python to whole new level in past years Where the level is a deep hole in the ground you cannot see the bottom of? Seriously, that was one of the worst additions to the language since its inception... Well, maybe `mypy` is worse, but it doesn't have the same magnitude, but probably more absurd.
Exciting! When you are ready, please add your language server to our [Implementations](https://github.com/openlawlibrary/pygls/blob/master/Implementations.md) document.
About as good as Jython, I'd guess, and probably facing the same issues. Most of the hot-topic uses of Python right now just don't work that well on anything that isn't CPython (though pypy is working double-time to fix this). Putting Python on .NET or on the JVM just doesn't give many Python developers anything they really want.

`min()` should work fine. Have you tried it?
As far as not leaving my current job, no choice there, I've already resigned. Last day is tomorrow. There's been a been a bit of a blood letting hear and tons of layoffs so it was kind of a mutually amicable layoff/resignation. The company is circling the drain... Financially I'm good for about a year, so in some ways it's now or never.
Please ask this over in /r/learnpython
No you should be excited because there’s hope for the younger generation.
I have no idea what you mean with "hope for the younger generation". Are you a bitter old man?
This must be intended as python 2.7 code? It looks like the endian setting and the encoding of `contents` could be potential problem areas. The xrange function (now just range) returns an iterable generator that yields the (0, 1, 2, ... X-1) where X is the first arg in the single argument function call. The code is using the fact that 8 bits make a byte, so if you have 3 bytes, then you can read 8 bits three times to read all the bits. Here they are using 8bits to represent a character, so processing each batch of 8 bits and appending the results to a string should work. 
`range` is a function that creates a list of integers. For example, `range(3)` will return you `[0, 1, 2]`. In Python2, this could be problematic if the argument was a large number. For example, if you call `range(1000000)` you now have in memory an array with 1 million objects. This is specially bad, because you can always just generate the next element if you know the current one and you don't have to keep the whole thing in memory. This is what `xrange` does. It creates returns an object which you can iterate over, without having to keep all the elements in memory at all time. Such objects are called generators, and you can read more about it [here](https://wiki.python.org/moin/Generators). Note that in Python3 there is no `xrange`, as `range` builtin was replaced by a generator. So basically this line of code returns a string where you concatenate the result of reading 8 bits, `bytes` times and converting them to `chr`. 
Thanks! I must have edited while you were writing, but yeah I ruled out the xrange thing also (I was definitely over-thinking that). And yes the whole library is written for 2.7. I've tried going little-to-big endian but hasn't seemed to matter. What is this `contents` you speak of?
Wow name checks out :) But no really this is very down and dirty advice, I appreciate. A coding bootcamp feels like a good idea. Some of them are very accelerated also. Do you think there's value in doing one (Are they just one more beginner's tutorial that I've already done a ton of) and then immediately applying to a shady consultant company? Some of said bootcamps offer placement no? I imagine it's more like they will "try" to place you. 
It might be quite some time, but I will!
Well, he did say that he wrote it with his dad. 
Thanks for explaining! I actually think it was reading on generators that messed me up (talking about return self-referential objects, etc) whereas this was just a simple 1..8. But I'm glad to know this going forward - also explains why I'd never seen xrange before since I rarely touch 2.7
No I’m not, but I enjoy the fact that much younger people are taking an interest in advanced topics like this and excelling in it.
Just added the github code to the article. Yeah it's a cool course but honestly pretty hefty. I've taken many coursera courses and the assignments are often somewhat soft, but this one doesn't mess around! Thanks for the feedback! I'd just go for it honestly, wordpress is free and I think it's good to get started even if it's just throwing incomplete ideas and projects out there.

I went the degree route and just happen to land on the shady consultant company without knowing. Prior to that I've done freelance stuff (webdev, dev for research teams). My problem with obtaining first "corporate/company" job was how i advertised myself. That's really the only benefit in joining a consultant company. They try to do the advertising and present you at a nice light for prospective employers. But most of the interview process is confidence, communication skills, then being honest in what you do and don't know about the tech, also luck (not important if you apply in bulk). If you pay attention to what they do or what they ask you to do, you can manage that on your own without the fordging/lying out of your ass. Just make sure the person you communicate with isn't struggling to communicate in english or (or speaks it broken). As for coding bootcamps, look for one that has you create decent fullstack projects. While doing those add automated testing, and CI pipelines with aws. I love python specifically because of it's versatility that lets you do all that (minus front end). Make sure you create a nice github portfolio/live-demo-site. A good 5 projects with 100+ commit history each do well enough work. Make sure to use vueJS/reactJS (angular is dead idc what people say). - be warned, front end dev frameworks change more frequent than backend, so focusing on it will be more challenging to stay relevant. You should also read the book "clean code - a handbook on agile crastmenship". It'll teach you what's bad or acceptable testing. What's shit code and what's not. These type of things reflect maturity in someone's craft IMHO. 
Yes, your object’s representation (as set by the __repr__ method) when it is printed is ‘MHH’. That does not mean that your object is ‘MHH’. For example: if you have a Person object p and you print(p), it may __repr__ as ‘John Smith’. That does not mean that p == ‘John Smith’. str(p) == ‘John Smith’ will work but is a lousy test for equality as it may ignore other attributes on the object p. 
Added the + notation and reformatted it a little. I think it looks nicer now, ty.
Mypy and PEP-484 have not been around for very long. Expecting the python interpreter to be rewritten to use optional static typing for whatever reason at this point is a fantasy. (Putting aside the question whether it's a good or bad idea)
The Python language and the existing interpreter implementations were designed for dynamic typing and polymorphism; that's a design feature, not a flaw. Using type annotations Python could, potentially, speed up a relatively small number of operations -- by tossing out some introspection pathways -- but at the end of the day the reason Python cannot do what Rust can do comes down to it being interpreted and all the important decisions about scheduling and memory allocation being made at runtime instead of at compile time. You may as well ask why isn't Rust interpreted and dynamically typed? Different languages are intended for different problems and sport different features... you can't just swap out the machinery that supports those features because you like what a different language does.
If h[x][0] returns an object the comparison to a string will implicitly convert the object to a string. 
That's `subreddit`, not `subredit`.
Im envious
Contents is an arg passed to the class constructor, which contains the data that is iterated over. If I was getting strange results, I would verify that contents is of the expected type and contains data of the expected type. For instance, you might need to explicitly make it an array of bits. 
&gt; Why Python interpretter doesn't leverage the static typing ifa developer puts extra efford to have a statically typed code? This is because Python started as a highly dynamic language, and type annotations only came later, as a kind of standardised doc string format. mypy is designed as basically an external super lint checker, that knows how to check doc strings against your code. But mypy is an entirely separate project rather than say part of the python interpreter. Python's newer constructs (eg dataclasses) are starting to take advantage of static types when they're provided. Also, Python's static type system isn't designed for being efficiently compilable to machine code. eg - where rust has u8, u16, u64, Python only has a higher level 'int' type that's more useful to humans. The Pypy team had the option of using the type annotations, but decided it's still far more efficient to inspect data at runtime to eg, determine when to use the equivalent of u8, u16, etc. You may be interested in mypy's sister project, mypyc (still very alpha/not useful for general dev), which does attempt to use the python type annotations to produce efficient C code: https://github.com/mypyc/mypyc 
sys.stdout.write &lt;-- It's obvious in C-languages but it's available in Pyton as well. Surprised I had to do a good bit of digging before the first time I saw it in action. &amp;#x200B; That and \`code\` module for ad-hoc testing. Can write a test module, pass the code to \`code\` and interactively test operations. Useful for ETL operations. &amp;#x200B; That and the entire \`Hypothesis\` library for unit testing. As a Data Engineer, a decent one, I find it useful to write tests but hard to write "good" tests. Hypothesis is basically pre-loaded with "good" tests and really cuts down on managing tests.
C# has real threading with all bells and whistles, while in Python the threading capability depends on the interpreter you use and is still lacking in performance. 
It's definitely correct. I can read the same data as a single 32-bit chunk and get the correct value, but when it comes through in four 8-bit chunks (translated to ASCII) they are wrong. I'm baffled.
I like C# when I have to integrate with other MS products like Active Directory, SQL Server or other .NET assemblies. It's just much faster for me to get done than in Python. PowerShell is another alternative when working with the MS stack but IMHO PowerShell is not well suited to making anything more involved than a function library. What Python brings to the table is a philosophy to get the programmer up and running without a lot of fuss. There are tons of batteries-included libraries and lots of syntactic sugar. 
Enabling rich tracebacks that contain local variable values at all function call levels. Most python web frameworks feature this, and even one of the built-in modules: https://docs.python.org/2/library/cgitb.html But for general devops-type stuff, I like to use a third-party library that integrates well into the standard python logging modules, eg: https://brennivin.readthedocs.io/en/latest/brennivin.traceback2.html Also, taking full advantage of mypy and static type annotations. It's a bit of extra work up front, but helps a hell of a lot for being able to refactor and catch typos/etc later on. I particularly like - vs many other widely-used high level langs - being able to enforce via the type system that some variables or function params can never contain None values, or that the None value is always handled by your code.

Repl.it ceo here. So we're rolling out a version that gets rid of the project/eval mode distinction. It's now completely rolled out for logged in users. What this means is that every run evaluates the entire program then drops you into a repl with that evaluated environment. From the repl any expression you evaluate will be done in the context of the prepared environment -- you can access top-level variables and functions. So to answer your questions: 1. Not right now, although this is planned. However, you can copy over to the console the expression and evaluate it 2.yes 3. Yes, evaluate expressions in the console to your hearts desire Let me know if you have questions.
Plumbum is life.
I suggest you look into repl.it because it not only gives you a free python shell, it gives you agree some 40 languages shells and free containers, free web hosting, and a community to boot :)
I'm sorry, /u/augb2018, but *of course* we're going to call it "piggles."
We're glad you picked Repl.it. it's worth noting that it's relatively a new phenemona so lots of the old schoolers dismiss it or don't bother looking into it. You should check out our community for questions, it's really helpful and full of hobbyists like yourself: http://repl.it/talk You can email me directly at any time: amjad@repl.it
do you use git...?
Kanbanflow, not sure if it is what you are looking for though
&gt; And yes the whole library is written for 2.7 why though
https://youtu.be/MCs5OvhV9S4 you can do much more. BTW: this is basically how asyncio works (and exactly how twisted implement their event loop)
You'll have to ask [Blizzard](http://blizzard.com) that one
For most of my OSS stuff where I'm in control of the project management tools, I use all the tools github provides. Issues, milestones, wiki, pull requests, PR reviews, Projects, etc.

Thank you. The mypyc looks more like a proof of concept than an alpha. But at least someone shares my thoughts. Can you elaborate the dataclasses part more? I'm interested.
Each language has its uses and weird quirks 
I was thinking more like "Python should borrow the CPython typing feature" than "why Python sucks and Rust doesn't." Look at the video link in the original post. You will get my idea.
If it requires complete rewrite then yes.
python doesn't think that you suck
Maybe its you who sucks ?
Just hyperbole. Usually I would pass a class object to the defaultdict, like `int`. This means you get a default value of 0, since that's what `int()` returns with no arguments. Often I want something slightly more complicated as my default, like nested defaultdicts, objects with some prefilled values, or a counter that doesn't start at 0. This just makes setting that kind of thing up a little easier, and that's useful for me since I write a ton of throwaway code in my data science-y job.
What if it requires a 90% rewrite? What if it requires a 10% rewrite? What if it's 5%? At what point should we give up the core lessons and assumptions learned over the past 3 decades of cpython development? Are there easy gains to be had? Probably, and if so, they will come.
One day I’ll be this cool. You can share this story with your grandkids one day. 
Sure , but it's not an XOR .. oh wait, you don't know what an XOR is lol. Cause python's just a scripting language :) 
"Some use cases for using generator and send()" in [this StackOverflow thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19302530/python-generator-send-function-purpose) made the concept of `yield` with an argument clear to me. I had been looking all over all morning to make the example code clear (which, BTW is taken directly from [the docs](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/functional.html#passing-values-into-a-generator)). 
Nothing stopping folks from an "unoffficial" pronunciation! :)
Still seems complicated compared to the beauty of docopt.
You’ll excuse me if I don’t respect the opinion of someone who doesn’t know the difference between `its` and `it’s`.
Sololearn, hands down
The problem you are trying to solve is not clear. But if you're programming a solution consider using the YouTube API? E.g. [https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/#Search](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/#Search)
Trello at work, for personal projects I go with Github/Gitlab issues.
For the ability to upgrade the python version when new releases happen, along with other software installed through brew on your computer. Basically you run `brew upgrade outdated` and it saves you having to visit n different sites to download the latest of each and install each in turn
"piggles" works certainly for _pigls_ ... perhaps, another project begging to be started?
lol youre sick bro 
Looks cool. Check pep-8.
Im also a beginner - I'm trying to get my head around building a web scraper to download all the critical role podcasts. 
Thanks, I appreciate the information. Among the reasons why I like [Repl.it](https://Repl.it) is it's evolving and improving. I actually already [posted to Repl Talk](https://repl.it/talk/ask/Python-expression-evaluation-workflow/9420) but received no feedback.
Damn and I gave you like three instances of it. That's exactly how much I hate python right now. 
Thanks for the update, the distinction between Eval Mode and Project Mode seemed a bit confusing and limiting. I'm glad evaluating individual expressions is planned. I had submitted a [feature suggestion](https://repl.it/feedback/p/add-eval-region-action-to-editor) and found the workaround of copy/pasting code from the editor to the REPL.
It depend on where you store the data, some databases have special field types for latitude/longtitude. 
For what it's worth OP this is probably the explanation you're looking for.
There is definitely no shortage of C# libraries out there, especially since C# has easy faculties for binding to C/C++ or any other .Net language out there for that matter. One step further - there is an absolutely insane amount of "stuff" already in the .Net framework.
That's not CPython, that's Cython... the first is the C-implementation of a standard Python interpreter, and so it's dynamically typed by design and can't (and shouldn't) entirely adopt that idea. The second is a superset of the Python language and an accompanying compiler that allows compilation of Python-like code into a module that _isn't_ interpreted at runtime; yes you can get a large speed boost, though you also lose the benefits of dynamic typing and runtime evaluation, just as you would with a Python extension written in C (or for that matter Rust). The point is if you want to get the benefits of static typing and compilation in Python there are already avenues for doing so -- and just one is switching to Cython -- so why hobble the majority of the users of the language just so that the minority can get a benefit they already have access to?

So edgy.
Nice write up; the figures look great. This is a great example of how important it is to properly parameterize the optimization problem. In this case, you have an optimal solution that you know should be smooth (C1 continuous) but you are drawing candidates from a non-smooth (C0 continuous) population of functions. That makes things very challenging for the optimizer, because it has to find a subspace of near-smooth solutions embedded withing the non-smooth population. Take a look at [Cubic Hermite Splines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubic_Hermite_spline). It's a pretty straight forward and effective way to parameterize smooth curves (there are lots of options that would work as well like B-splines, classic spline, piecewise polynomials, etc.) The only trick then becomes evaluating the fitness function when your path is a spline; in this case sampling the spline at N=50 points and evaluating fitness for the piecewise-linear approximation should be sufficient. I bet if you run the GA algorithm with 5 heights and 7 slopes (internal knots + end points) you will get an answer very quickly. Additionally, I think your objective function (the calculation of the time along each segment) is incorrect, which may be why you are not achieving convergence to the exact solution. I believe that these lines: v = v[:-1] t = (np.sqrt(v**2 + 2*g*d) - v)/(g*d/np.sqrt(d**2 + self.delta_x**2)) Imply that t(i), the time to traverse the segment, is proportional to the segment length times the difference of the left/right velocities. That's more like optimizing the integrated acceleration, or maximizing velocity at the endpoint (but not quite, because of the extra 1/d). To properly estimate travel time, I suggest dividing segment length by the *average* of the left/right velocity: vmid = 0.5*(v[1:] + v[:-1]) slen = np.sqrt(d**2 + self.delta_x**2) t = slen/vmid Good luck!
My current and previous jobs used JIRA, but that's not my choice. Personally, I don't think a lot of that stuff is necessary at all. Somehow big open source projects like the Linux kernel get it done just using email and Git. 
I just took a good look at [docopt](http://docopt.org/). It always made me chuckle, but I watched the video on the homepage and it looks impressive. 
It definitely depends on the project and use case. Shapefiles and GeoJSON are great for small data analysis projects since GeoPandas support reading and writing to them natively. If you’re doing a medium sized data analysis project using a file geodatabase (.gdb) or a spatialite database can be good. For large projects or any form of web development I’d suggest using PostgreSQL with PostGIS. Once you get PostGIS setup it’s probably best to just use it for everything though since it’s so powerful. Other enterprise databases like MS SQL or Oracle have spatial data types but have less features and are more expensive to run in AWS RDS which is likely where your employer would host their databases.
Using `toolz.functoolz.curry` and `functools.partial` for template functions. Example, from hashlib import md5, sha256 @curry def checksum(func, fname, buffer=4*1024): """Base implementation for different hashing algorithms. Args: func (Callable): fname (str): buffer (int): Raises: IOError Returns: bytes """ if not os.path.isfile(fname): raise IOError(fname) sha = func() with open(fname, 'rb') as fp: for chunk in iter(lambda: fp.read(buffer), b''): sha.update(chunk) return sha.digest() md5sum = checksum(md5) sha256sum = checksum(sha256) 
Folium works natively with GeoJSON and also with Pandas dataframes which are easy to load from CSV. In general, KML/GeoJSON is very portable, but gets unwieldy as the amount of data increases. Shapefiles have much more compact storage and will be faster if you have complex polygons or a lot of them. If you don't have that much data then any of the formats will work well for you and GeoJSON/KML may have some advantages being plain text files. As the amount of data increases you will need to pay more attention to the storage and indexing and less to the convenience. There are really 2 problems you solve with data formats: 1) how do I acquire the data and how do I share it? 2) how do I analyze/present the data? The answers are often not the same. OGR has great tools for converting between most common formats. PostGIS is the lingua franca of the opensource geo database world. At some point you will need to work with all of the formats you list and more.
Sooooo, because you were sent to learnpython, I assume because your question was more suitable there, you decide to fire up an angry post about you not liking Python? ...Well, ok. That doesn't make much sense, but whatever floats your boat. If your intention was to trigger us and start a flame war, I have a bad news: nobody here cares. Really. Languages are different and nobody is expected to love them all. I hate PHP and JavaScript. There, you are not unique. C is great, my favorite. Stick to it.
Because string.join accepts any iterable, not just lists. If it was list.join you would have to convert the iterable into a list first. https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/stdtypes.html#str.join
OK, that makes sense. Thanks!
I don't think it is list.split(string), isn't it string.split() which returns a list?
`string.join(...)` works with any iterable or generator, not just lists. It is also a spring-specific operation, so it belongs to the string type, not the list type. If `iterable.join(string)` would be a standard, it would require every single iterable type (set, list, string, dict, file, range, ...) to implement this functionality. You'd need this method on hundreds of classes, instead of just one. Also, `list.split(string)` does not exist. `split` is also a method on `string`, where it belongs.
First of all the join method accepts any iterable. Not only lists. So any builtin iterable like list, set, tuple, dict would have to implement join method. Now you can pass your own objects to join method until they have implemented iteration protocoll. If join would not be method of a str you would have to implement join method yourself. &amp;#x200B; Additionaly let's think of how would join method of a list work. List is mutable and you would expect that join method of a list would not return anything but modify original object. So we will end up with changing type from list to str. That's terrible idea.
You are right, I corrected it, but I meant that the general content of the list or string is the thing with the method on, with the splitter being a small parameter.
Thank you for clarifying!
Thank you for the explanation!
Is futures lib an option? 
Well my last experience was with with C++ in the late 1990's. Which is quite a while ago. Then, the language was very verbose in what you needed to type to do the simplest things...... Thinking I should look at the language again.
[https://github.com/johnward-umensch/Sparlab](https://github.com/johnward-umensch/Sparlab) [https://www.umensch.com/downloads/](https://www.umensch.com/downloads/) 
Do you mean C# ? Quite different than C/C++, even in it's earliest days. C# is in the family of C languages in terms of syntactic basics, but it is a far cry from being as verbose. I would say that C# and Python have similar levels of verbosity, with a very slight edge to Python. The benefits of a compiled language are very apparent when using C# and C# has a WIDE array of features that take advantage of static typing while allowing for some very dynamic Finally, you can interop with Python (still in beta-ish) via IronPython as well as taking advantage of the dynamic language runtime to utilize a TON of dynamic language features in C#.
Was super-easy to use. Error-handling requires a bit more work than the other approaches based on [this article](https://realpython.com/comparing-python-command-line-parsing-libraries-argparse-docopt-click/#error-handling).
Yeah. It doesn't have as many features as the other options. I tend not to mind, and rely on other libraries for other functionality depending on the needs of the project. 
I'd recommend the head first series for any language. The first 2 or 3 chapters will go over those basics, but skip those chapters and you'll be right into the good stuff.
&gt;Also, the inverse operation, list.split(string)is the opposite way round. There is no `list.split()` method, the "inverse" I assume you are talking about is `str.split()`, which returns a list. &amp;#x200B; &gt;Does anyone know why Python uses string.join(list)instead list.join(string)? Because str.join() can join any iterator, not just lists. Ie. tuples, sets, dictionary keys, etc.
Anything from a 2000s netbook to the latest and shiniest gear will run Python, so if you find that Android doesn't give you the experience that you want, the bar isn't very high for a starter laptop, especially if you're OK with playing around with Linux.
Ironic one could enjoy C and hate Python. It's like enjoying a road trip but hating every car. And lol, dive into JQuery .. and you'll be where I was at. 
I tried jQuery already, ~5 years ago. Didn't like it. It's still JavaScript, but with lots of "magic". That is why I don't make webapps anymore, only backends and API when I really have to. Thankfully, I'm not a programmer, so I don't need to program things I don't like. Try Go language. If you like C, you should be delighted with it.
The reason you suck at multiprocessing is the same reason everyone else sucks at it: the abstractions are excessively raw and a lot of magic is used to glue them together. Tell us a little more about the problem(s) you are solving, and we can possibly recommend some higher level alternatives
As a beginner, I would like to see if possible
I have worn out the spine on my copy of *Python In A Nutshell* -- it's a lot of the stuff you need to know, while assuming you can just kinda grok the basics. Also, the official documentation online is generally pretty good!
The problem that triggered this question I've described on [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53951344/fetching-large-tables-from-postgres-into-csv-using-python-multiprocessing-speed) . And when I was trying to found the solutions browsed lot of resources, was trying to find answers on most popular Python books and I did not find anything valuable there. There was vast of unstructured information that was too complex for me to understand. So that's why I am asking this question here. Of course I am more interested in multi-process interaction of Python with databases, but I want to know more and cover other blind spots
That's some good ol' fashioned broken logic.
I have a small chromebook that isn't super pleasant to use at the moment, so I am learning using android apps on my phone. I plan on purchasing a macbook pro for coding/school within the next few weeks.

Yes.
I’m not a programmer, just a data wrangler by trade. Learning math is always a good idea but I wouldn’t beat myself up about it. I “cheat” by using languages such as Python to allow me to phrase the problem and take care of arithmetic errors that I would normally make. By thinking through whatever problem I have in front of me, I solve the math problem. Yes, it quite often resembles brute force but version 2 or 3 tends to be more elegant. Essentially I learn the math by writing the code. Hope that helps.

In short, yes. If you ever have to deal with any sort of data, financial, or real world applications of computers, you will want to know at least some basic statistics, algebra, calculus and possibly trigonometry. If you combine all of those topics and apply them to a real world problem, you end up with physics or some other science that uses mathematical concepts. The logic involved in mathematical proofs is also similar to the way a computer "thinks" (if statements, conditionals, booleans, and/or logic, etc) so it is very useful to understand on a basic level. Lots of complex notation uses mathematical notation, so it can be useful to know the formal notation to understand. I struggled with math most my life - keep practicing and use all the free online resources like Kahn Academy, YouTube, Wolfram Alpha, and others. Most everyone who thinks they are poor at math (I believe) is out of practice, or in a need of three or four explanations from different sources to grasp the concept. Go to a used bookstore and grab a textbook. Take a class at the community college. Find a mentor either in person or online. You've got this! PM me for some past materials and syllibi if you want. Cheers.
Math doesn't help you much with this kind of problems. Do some more programming instead. And read at other people's code to learn from them.
I have never learned any math and then thought later "that was a waste of time". It's helped me in numerous ways both predicted and unpredicted (i.e. learned something on a whim and often just months later it comes up IRL).
One it sounds like you don't really have a good understanding of the async programming model. Unless you are willing to put in the work, you won't find any programming language where concurrency will just work with no understanding. Though it sounds the concurrent futures module would probably work for your use case, but again will probably require you put in some work. 
It’s going To be a work in progress
Fluent Python is from my experience the best book for someone familiar with python and programming in general.
You might want to try [numba](http://numba.pydata.org), a just-in-time compiler which allows you to keep your pure python code. Of course your milage will vary based on your code; if you have lots of loops and use numpy you should see big performance gains.
&gt;Hypothesis looks super interesting, thanks for the tip.
As stated by another, you really have to understand your problem before you can apply anything more sophisticated then linear programming. I do a lot of calculations based on databases for financial investing, where each database represents one stock symbol. The multiprocessing module works great in this application because each CPU can work on its own independent database. I basically get linear speed up. First suggestion - parse out your problem and find out what is consuming wall clock time. Then understand what parts of your problem can be done in parallel without getting into race conditions. Then, if it’s worth the time and effort, apply multiprocessing. Pool.map and Pool.starmap are pretty well drop-ins for sequential processing as long as the problem you’re trying to solve can be broken into pieces.
Tell me more about using the \`code\` module for testing! I'm also a data engineer, but I can't quite parse what you're talking about. &amp;#x200B; I'll look into the hypothesis library, I haven't dug into it before, but I've heard of it.
Delete the last block and the variable this_event and replace it with last_event. That way the variable last event does not change unless the door is opened. No need for a conditional statement :)
If I do that last_event gets updated with the current datetime each time I refresh the page. If I don't declare last_event then I get a variable used before being declared error.
My apologies I quickly glanced over this.... What is the data type of this event?
I do a lot of number crunching (using non-trivial algorithms). I used to write things in C and call them using CFFI. Then I discovered ***numba***. Just put @jit and the stuff runs really fast (with a bit of change sometimes, of course).
can I use it for reinforcement learning? 
Code: https://docs.python.org/3/library/code.html I've used it as a REPL of sorts. Write a function. Import into the REPL, run the REPL and play around. Of course, you have to think around reloading it on the fly but it's a pretty cool tool. Hypothesis is great and easy to use. I've gotten the most utility out of it with anything that requires matrix mathematics.
I want to store the last time a door was opened or closed and display that on the web page. My problem is that the last_event keep getting updated with the current time every time I refresh the page. I know I'm probably overlooking something obvious, but I can't see it. Hoping another set of eyes will help. 
Sigh, I really wish the Python devs would adopt i++ as a valid iterator too...
What is OGR?
Thanks
Interesting. Are you using it like the IPython repl or ipdb? How does using the `code` module differ? It sounds like you may have your python code set up in a way that's unfamiliar to me. My project at work is organized as a python package with classes representing extraction-load jobs given a source. A class (generally) decides what needs to be done (accounting for late-arriving data) based on the state of the warehouse, extracts it's data source to a csv (adding providence columns) and inserts/merges the data. The extraction-load classes have scripts as entry points that we expose from a docker container that ultimately runs in production. For my uses, `pdb`/`ipdb` serves as a debugger and I generally run it in postmortum mode with `python -m pdb bin/load_foo.py --arg ...`. Do you use `code` the same way?
How does this work and where would you use it?
Sure!
Well I have worked hard and learned some things so far, but not enough to be directly applicable. It seems like the multiprocessing module should do a lot of what I want and it was easy to get a basic example going; def newDriver(driverPath): driver = webdriver.Chrome(driverPath + r"\chromedriver.exe") return(driver) if __name__ == '__main__': with Pool(5) as p: try: print(p.map(newDriver, [driverPath, driverPath, driverPath])) except: traceback.print_exc() Wish I understood more of syntax, like how not to have to specify driverpath multiple times with map. I know why it works, I just don't know a better way.
Your `last_event` variable will always update to the current time because you're assigning it to [`datetime.now`](https://datetime.now)`()`. Every time you refresh the page, it will always get the current time. Instead your variable `last_event` should be only be updated with [`datetime.now`](https://datetime.now)`()` when you send a POST request. Your initial `last_event` should be given the time of the last POST request. How you do that is up to you... You could pickle the `last_event` variable into a local file and read it on your first `last_event` call.
Does the i++ have the ability to operate on strings? In python the += can merge integers, strings, sets, etc. it's more than simply a loop tool.
Adding to this, because I don't have full context of how your app operates, here's a very basic example of how I would do it using pickle: @app.route("/", methods=["GET", "POST"]) def index(): """ Returns current state of the doors. Open/close a door if requested. """ import pickle last_event_file = "./last_event.txt" # always read the same event time from the last POST request last_event = pickle.load(last_event_file) # If POST then operate the selected door and log the event time. if request.method == "POST": door = request.form["door"] operate_door(door) dt_now = datetime.now().strftime('%m-%d - %H:%M') last_event = pickle.dump(dt_now, last_event_file) # Return the current door status regardless of whether GET or POST door_status = get_door_status() return render_template("index.html", door_a=door_status[0], door_b=door_status[1], last_event=last_event) If you could save the `last_event` variable into memory within your application, that could work just as well. But to reiterate, I don't have full visibility on your application so I can't give you a more specific solution other than this.

Based on the description of the problem, how do you plan to do it as a human? Python will not help you if you can't solve the problem first.
ii am just starting to use python btw 
I agree with your last thought, there. Without timestamps or unique messages, it's not really possible. :O Consider the scenario where your scraper hits the page once, sees a page full of "Time Not Established" entries, then again a little while later. You have no way to distinguish "no new events have arrived" from "100 new events have arrived that happen to be identical to the 100 previous events".
Py2Exe converts .py files into .exe files. This is reverse-able, meaning you can get the code back from the .exe file.

Wonderful, that is great news. So basically I can pay someone else for the updates with no problem?
Was going to suggest at least+5 minutes. One never knows how big the files are coming in especially in the future. If op says "They will never be bigger than......", he'll need to eat his words at some point because it will happen
Yup, should work. Hopefully the code made by the first programmer isn't too messy for the new one.
I would create a primary key in your database and come up with a way to deduplicate via database triggers. For example, use the node name + the day (just the day, not the hour or minute, this can make it too unique and cause too much noise) . With other tools out there, you can construct a primary key by using regular expressions to grab specific variables from the alarm to construct this primary key. Do not use time seconds and hours as this might be too unique and cause too much noise. Also, deduplication is being able to get multiple alarms from the same source which relates to the same problem. For example, cpu high on node xyz on dec 25. This could be used to construct a primary key. You might want to also expand on the database table and some more fields to store more data from the alarm. Hope this helps 
Seconded. It’s a book that assumes you know everything taught in a basic programming class, then teaches you the Pythonic way to do everything else.
Good call with this. The only thing I would do differently would be to name the file \`last\_event.pickle\` so it isn't confused for an actual text file.
Alternately, saving/loading a json file would work much the same way, but then also be human editable/readable.
How does the .NET framework compare to the available libraries for Python via pip?
Thanks a lot. &amp;#x200B; I have one more stupid question. This bot uses a UI and it has tabs. What the new programmer needs to add (apart from a major bugfix) is something that will need a new tab. Can he do it without much hassle? &amp;#x200B; Like, is ''the code for the tabs'' already there? Does he need some extra UI designing effort to do that?
Inserting a new tab is easy, so are buttons, etc.. the functionality is usually where the complexity is.
Just so we don't see the porn tab haha
Beautiful, good work man.
The ol "hit the sack then go to bed" huh?
Great stuff, thanks a bunch!
Thanks. I'm hooked!
If you wan't to take on a challenge, chromebooks can be converted to linux machines. While it won't be very powerful, you will be able to play around with python.
C# is much less verbose than C or C++. Though it does suffer from some of the same verbosity issues as Java.

Great taste in music! Love the daily mixes
I really like redmine, it's very easy to set up and extend 
Have you tried Trio?
Automating the boring stuff was my first book. Automated my job at the time down from about 80 hours down to about 2 to 4 over the course of 6 months and began consulting after that. Keep it up.

Quite the setup you've got there, and it's really nice. Half of the fun is in the routine really. Keep it up!
I dunno if this applies to your use case, but for datasets of high dimension tensors (e.g. volumetric weather forecasts) the netCDF format and the xarray Python package are *awesome*. NetCDF is based on the HDF5 format but with a simplified data model that makes for more user friendly APIs. NetCDF comes from the world of weather and climate research, but it's generally useful for any high dimension dataset. Xarray was born out of Pandas and is essentially a generalization of Pandas to higher dimensions (i.e. non-tabular data).
What kind of consulting do you do?
That is clearly a mouse!
What was the job you were able to automate? That’s an incredible reduction. 
Was doing same kind of work for the same company. Programming. Mainly for automation, maintains nice and updating of old systems.... it was all engineering design stuff. 
That’s what she said. /s
The Qt documentation is atrocious?
Holy crap. That Learning Python book is 1,648 pages?! ... I need it!!!
Computers are tools to *save* work and reduce complexity, not create work and increase complexity. Seems like a lot of people forget this.
Nice books. But my own, unsolicited two cents: unless you plan on becoming a python dev or work in a field that uses python on a daily basis, there's no reason to actually \*learn\* the language (or any language at all). The basic programming fundamentals like data structures and algorithms and the overarching OOP paradigm are more important. At least for me, I've only ever used python in bursts and I've only memorized generic functions. Documentation and stack overflow covers everything else. 
People i need to be like, this guy. 
Discord bot!!! I’ve been looking for a project outside of work. I play a game called clash of clans, I’m sure you guys have heard of it. The clan has been manually tracking players stats so I’ve request to create bots to help. Boiiiii have I learned! I’ve learned how to use discord api, clash of clans api, use requests, set up a Django server with sqlite3. This is just the beginning! All by just having fun and playing a game. 
Also learning Python right now. Been "automating the boring stuff" at work, and it's been excellent. Had to download 514 videos off of a video hosting site that's getting shut off by the end of the week, and then had to change every single video from the random 20-digit numerical title to the actual title of the videos. Every one of those 514 videos. Ended up writing a Python script that's less than 20 lines of code and sat back while I watched "an entire day's work" get done in about two hours in the background while I goofed off.
The conceptual thinking will transcend programming languages. Besides, Python is one of the most in demand languages right now. How is staring with Python going to prevent you from getting a decent software job. As someone who has written alot of code in alot languages, I'm not sure how you "*learn*" code without starting in an actual "*language*". What do you propose we all do to become Heman Master of the Code? 
Dope music selection man.
I looked into that briefly, right now I'm trying to see if a simpler thing like Pathos can work for me. Thanks for your suggestion.
Learning a friendly language like python is a good start to learning the fundamentals you mentioned.
Visual studio and Sublime Text at the same time? Damn you must be hardcore
Are the O’Reilly book any good? I’ve heard from several people they are not very well done. What has your experience been with them?
I've never run across pickle in my short time writing python scripts. Time to read up. Thanks much!
That's quite a first book I think mine might been "where the wild things are" and even that went over my head. 
I was trying to do this all with just variable, but I guess keeping that time in a file would be the way to go. Thanks for the feedback!
Yeah, I’m curious about this too. 
Love this book. While I was in school I spent a lot of time learning algorithms and data-structures working in a variety of languages but wasn't until I had a pretty rough interview that I realized I needed to get very comfortable with at least one language and this is the book that got me there
I've been putting off learning coding for a while, just got a python book over the holidays and read a bit the other night. I think you just inspired me to really get into it with this one simple picture. Thank you and good luck.
nice autism dude 
Good shit man those headphones are clean! I just started picking it up for some work related stuff and ended up loving it. It was frustrating but rewarding. I've easily dumped 200 hrs in the past two months into it. Been doing anything I can in it now just to learn more. Its surprising how fast you can learn when you devote the time. From one slightly advanced beginner to nother keep on chugging and feel free to pm me if you want to shoot ideas back and forth! 
I’ve read this one and liked it.
How long have you been reading it? And what page you’re currently on?
I see you're using visual studio, nice!
With as fast a paradigms evolve, I’ve been hesitant on doing anything with a physical reference point. It’s kind of like when someone emails me a file instead of a hyperlink to the same file on a shared drive so the most current file is accessed. I suppose python has been around for a while...
Not compiled to machine code afaik, it’s bytecode similar to java
Working through it a couple of hours a night, going through with the book and doing examples of code along with it, I got through to chapter 14, which is the one that goes over CSV and JSON files, in a couple of nights. I'll have to admit that I haven't touched it in a while, mainly because I recently got "Impractical Python Projects" as an early Christmas present to myself, and have been fully consumed with that. Pure fun. I also did SoloLearn's python tutorial prior to reading AtBSwP, so I mainly just went through it fast, looking for the juicy stuff I needed to know to impress Karen from a counting with my sick Excel automation scripts. I'm working at this place part-time while I get through college, so I'm mainly doing tech "odds-and-ends" things here.
I hope you paid the belly rub tax prior to hitting the books. Looks like you did this time, as your buddy in the background is zonked.
I had that same book before graduating high school. 
I might be some kind of idiot for asking this, but reading books about programming really helps as much as people say? It always seemed to me that the best way to learn it was watching people doing it in the computer. I'm asking just because I plan to learn how to code in 2019 and am trying to figure out the best way to do it by myself!
Keep at it, mate! I started with the Python Crash Course (also by NoStarch Press) and Automate the Boring Stuff. Added on a Udemy Course - Complete Python Course by Techlado. From this, I built an app that automates a ton of spreadsheet building via openpyxl and pandas and auto uploads to a google team drive for my colleagues to operate from. Shortened a 5-6 hour task down to 1-2 minutes.

Can you trigger any of the events that get logged? Bonus points if the event is a rarer one. You could trigger an event then pull the log, if you find that the previous event isn’t in the log files, you could increase polling, or if there are too many, decrease polling. 
Compile python source to bytecode? Sure: https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html

You need two things: + Verified experience/better skills + A network that knows about work Here is what I would do: - start working on a large active Python project, close tickets - go to local meetups and behave like someone sr people want to work with/mentor - do not ask people are you hiring , let them know you are looking 
Use it in little pieces that way you can do whatever you want for a while. Pretend you're doing it by hand.
In addition to what others are saying, I'm assuming you are defining last\_event somewhere globally? Anything you declare in that index method is going to go out of scope and get cleaned up when you return.
Do still maintain rude systems to?
Read Learning Python cover to cover. Needless to say mine looks a lot nicer than yours now 
Wooooow. Haven’t met anyone outside my circle of friends that also listened to Volumes. Solid book, solid tunes. 
Worth it though. Read the first half carefully, and the next half as needed.
More like an interactive testing environment. I take it your organization is using Luigi? We're Airflow centric so my approach was to modularize all our code into an ETL library.

There are a lot of philosophical debates about if we humans developed language first or thoughts! Its hard to imagine having thoughts without a language, at the same time it is nearly impossible to have thoughts without a language!!

Mainly, dataclasses take advantage of type annotations to give a user-friendly, boiler plate-free syntax like this: @dataclass class InventoryItem: '''Class for keeping track of an item in inventory.''' name: str unit_price: float quantity_on_hand: int = 0 def total_cost(self) -&gt; float: return self.unit_price * self.quantity_on_hand During runtime the type annotations mostly aren't used. Mainly they're useful as user documentation, and something that can be cross-checked with mypy (or PyCharm, or other third-party tools) to help keep your logic self-consistent (in accounting terms - a bit like the "double ledger" system). More info over here: https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html

Karen's gonna be pretty damn wet when she hears about those scripts.
Are you saying that your nightly ritual is to arrange a pile of random coding books, a pair of headphones, and to have minimized various text editors in an effort to make yourself look super aloof and like you are actually studying three books at once?
I am going to compete Google python videos this week. I want to take it to next level and learn this language completely. I don't have a CS background so taking decision is a bit hard for me. Is this book good for me right now? Please recommend me something. Thanks 
Wait, I'm to be banned if I accidentally help someone rather than refer them to another sub? That sounds absurd. Reddit is my primary way of interacting with Python folks, and the main reason I use Reddit, and the idea of getting banned is pretty frightening.
If you can grasp sequence, selection and iteration you can learn most languages, it isn't until you start getting very specific into a programming language's syntax that it can take a lot of time to get better at it. Python is a great starting point, no need to think about compilation and the like.
Alr thanks
There are a good bunch of other resources you can use to do serialize variables, similar to pickle. I only used that example as the pickle module is part of the python standard library. It simply serializes your data into a local file which you can load back into python very easily. It's also important to note that you shouldn't be storing important data through pickle such as credentials, but use cases like storing a time variable is a great example of where you could use it. &amp;#x200B; As u/wefkjhsivuwef mentioned in his comment, it would be a lot simpler if you defined the `last_event` variable globally (that is to say, declared outside of `index()` function so it exists outside of the get/post request) it would be much easier and you wouldn't need to use pickle. 
E D U C A T I V E 
I'd start with a basic overview of syntax from someplace like codecademy.com Once you feel comfortable with syntax, start trying to solve some simple problems on a site like leetcode.com. Another great less-structured option is adventofcode.com for some toy problems. Main thing is that you get into writing really simple snippits of code early on. Don't spend forever in the syntax/textbook side of things -- focus on solving simple problems consistently. Have fun, good luck!

If there is no uniquely identifiable information in the log, your best bet is to clear the log after every grab of log entry data
You gotta format your code properly (not screenshot it) and you also need to say what you're trying to do that you can't. &amp;#x200B; Also, /r/learnpython is where you want to ask the question.
Good point! This also works, and gives you an explicit filename extension to let you know that its pickled data.
Mypy is not a proof of concept. You've just missed to goal of the package. It's not for doing what you think it should. PyPy doesn't take advantage of the type hints because it doesn't need them.
So if I just had a wedding where the cake was a python logo made out of blueberry and lemon cupcakes... where should I post about it?
Guido has said on many occasions Python went too far down the road of dynamic typing. Python may optionally back off in the future or use other fancy techniques to speed things up.
Is this book worth it
If you're using Python 3.4+, use `ensurepip` instead of downloading an installation script. ``` python3 -m ensurepip --user ```
Are you fracking for real?
Awesome, thanks for the tip! 😄
Scanned the comments and noticed that *Fluent Python* was conveniently missing. Please consider when the student is ready to become the master...
Does it still teach legacy python? If so, don't do it. 
No, it teaches Python 3.
Keep grinding 
Make something instead of reading. You'll learn more. There's safety in reading, you can't fail. But it's like a ship in harbor. They're safe there, but that's not what ships are for.
What has each book contributed to you from a pov at which your Python skill was at the time you started reading one of them? What was your first book?
My pleasure my friend
I learned Perl by watching a colleague write scripts. Being “self taught” via this method was really what has allowed me to self teach myself new languages via video/books/trial and error. I find that I learn best by examples that relate to the work I’m specifically trying to accomplish versus foo/bar examples that functionally show you how a feature within a language works but doesn’t necessarily help you in the way of implementation in a real world situation. 
Looks a lot like my night. Wrapped up a Udemy course by Jose Portilla (I highly recommend his stuff) and dove into my Python Cookbook (big fan of Dave Beazley!). 
The only thing that is not pep8 approved is line length... i just use 120 because i have a big screen :)
Next on my list. 
As you mentioned flask is an option. Create a basic flask app with a single route that triggers the logic. You can deploy the code on a kubernetes stack for example, then access the endpoint through a browser. If you need to input something, create a basic html page and process the form values. Don't forget to secure the endpoint, otherwise everyone can trigger it
Would that o’reilly book be a good reference for both 2.7 and 3.x? If not, any recommendations on a dual reference book?
Worst thing ever 
Hi, wow, thanks for the awesome in depth reply! So, if I understand you correctly, using cubic hermite splines would basically be using them as a set of basis functions, and then searching for the right (linear?) combo of them? If I'm getting it right, that sounds cool and maybe I'll try expanding this to do that too. I definitely didn't put much thought into the parameterization, but I also wanted to try to avoid inserting any domain knowledge, which this might do if it's already limiting it to smoother curves (right?). Regarding the mechanics, it's totally possible I messed up, but let me just explain in case it's just a fault of my crappy commenting/documentation. (empirically, I think there's a good chance it's correct because if you look at the `getBrachistochroneSol()` function in Brachistochrone, that solves for the time/solution curve numerically via fsolve and an analytic form for the brachistochrone curve, and if you watch the plots of one of the ones that approximates the ideal solution well ([this one](http://declanoller.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/evolve_Brachistochrone__pop12__gen150__N12__height1.3__17-12-2018_23-07-41.gif) for example), the FF of the solution matches the FF of the numerically solved solution out to like 3 decimal places) But to explain my logic for the mechanics: I'm thinking of the line connecting two points as a plane at some angle, where the x distance of the plane is the same for all, as it's determined by N_pts. d is the height (y coord) for each plane, so that's the first line: d = -np.array([self.state[i+1] - self.state[i] for i in range(self.N_segments)]) Then, v (for each element in the list) is the accumulated velocity at the top of the corresponding plane, from the equation 0.5*m*v**2 = m*g*d (i.e., at each point all the potential energy has been converted to kinetic, where v is in the plane direction). So, because we have the velocity (in plane) at the start and end points of each plane, we can calculate the time it takes under constant accel. to gain that vel., via v_f = v_i + a_para*t --&gt; t = (v_f - v_i)/a_para, where a_para is the in plane accel. We can get the in plane accel from the gravitational accel. and the geometry of that plane via similar triangles, where a_para/a = d/d_para. Since d_para is the hypotenuse of the plane, we get a_para = a*d/sqrt(d**2 + d_x**2). The sqrt() in the numerator is just $v_f$, since doing it that way allowed me to do it without using a loop or list comprehension. Does that make sense? It's totally possible I missed something, but I think it should be correct within the approximation of a series of incline planes. 
Could you explain why installing PIP from the official distribution repository is "not the safe or the correct way"?
[I am surprised. I think we have same religion.](https://i.imgur.com/xQrnfvq.jpg)
If you mean, by the use of ```sudo apt install python3-pip```, that's so because, after doing this you don't get to install pypi packages without the sudo command i.e. ```sudo pip install``` and doing this means you're using pip with sudo. I tend to distrust most packages anyways, hence find this tradeoff not worthy. Just my opinion though 😁
This needs to be my offices mantra. 
Any good beginner guides on this ? Keep in mind I haven’t done this before 
Install PIP from packages and use Python's virtual environment. If you are paranoid, run scripts in a container.
Was sololearn any good?
It grew a bit compared to previous editions :-)
Clicking a series of buttons on a screen over and over again for 8 hours a day.
Which books would rather have me begin with instead? And why is it bad?
I'd look up a "Python programming for beginners" course on Youtube - a good one will start with setting up your environment. Then go through the course while typing out and running as much of the code as you can. The most important thing about learning a new programming language (IMHO) is actually practicing writing the code. Once you've got the basics down, also look at [http://www.codewars.com](http://www.codewars.com) and working on their challenges.
In April of this year, I knew absolutely nothing about coding. First thing I did when I decided to become a programmer was look for an app on my phone. Found SoloLearn and did the html course (because I had heard about that thing before). Ate through it in a day, created some terrible websites. Went through css and js, each taking another day. It was absolutely perfect, and I had no problems/snares. Then went onto PHP, JQuery, SQL, which all took about a day, too. By this time, I had followed some Traversy Media tutorials on getting an apachy server up and running, and was making GET and POST requests on my multi-page disaster of a personal website to my heart's content within a week. I felt like I could hack into the mainframe of anything. Then I got into those t h i c c programming languages they have on SoloLearn (Java, C++, Python, etc.). Each one sort of expected me to know stuff that I had no clue, and was the first time I had to go to Wikipedia to find out what an interpreter was. I quickly realized Wikipedia was awful for that, and then had to go to YouTube now just so I could follow along with the terminology of SoloLearn. But after the first couple of modules for C++ (that sounded like the most computer language so I stuck with it), it got easy. I was back to learning about loops, conditionals, etc., like in js. I highly recommend SoloLearn to anyone that knows absolutely nothing about coding, to at least do their courses for the webdev side of things, and then also do their other courses if you know a little bit about a language, like Python, but want to know about intermediate to the advanced techniques for the language. SoloLearn doesn't really teach Computer Science paradigms, like data structures, the three types of instruction, etc. It teaches you languages, their syntax, and how to use them, which is why I think it was a little hard to jump straight into the programming langauges. It's also fully free, so that's hot. /rant
Any of them. And everything about it really. The guy has no authority. He does not know what he is talking about yet he acts as if he does and can teach. I’d say go for automate the boring stuff with python. It looks good to me, but I didn’t learn from a book so consider asking other people.
Yeah, I am also considering the same, but why not begin with securing the simple stuff? Most people ought not to learn virtualenv or any other virtualization/containerization technique before they start with package management. It takes out the fun in coding. P.S: This is a beginner article really 😅
It works similar to the standard python (@property)[https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#property] decorator: The decorated method is turned into a (data descriptor)[https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#descriptors], so it looks like a normal instance attribute, but actually calls a method to calculate its value. While the default property calls the method every time, the cached property needs to calculate its value only once, and then replaces itself with a normal attribute. This works because python looks for attributes in `__dict__` first, and only checks data descriptors if the attribute is not in `__dict__`. This is useful if you have an attribute that is expensive to calculate, but does not change very often. For example, if you have a class that represents a 2d polygon as a list of points, you could use a cached property to represent the area of the polygon.

Thanks bud I’ll go with c++ then python 
I'd say a book is usually essential if you are a new programmer, due to certain concepts you need to grasp first. But if you have 1 language under your belt, what i usually see people do (and do myself) is get started practically with a project, and learn side by side with documentation/videos. This is quicker as books tend to have repeated knowledge, and programming languages overlap at some points anyway.
Sweet, dude.
"You'd better insert that disk, you...dick."
I thought the Python ones were great, and like O'Reilly books in general. Although I always plough through reviews first before making a purchase.
The QT documentation is more C documentation instead of Python documentation IMO. If you can change my mind, please do. 
No, the latest editions of this book focus on 3.x, although it does highlight some differences between 3.x and 2.x. I'm not aware of any books that comprehensively cover both versions. Most seem to focus on one or the other. 
I figured that’s how they would do it. Thanks. 
Do you recommend automate boring stuff? I'm looking for a python/bash book about automation/scripting to read before sleep so nothing "heavy" and hard for my tired brain :) 
He was most likely a specialist in bullshit. 
I think watching somebody's writing a program can be helpful sometimes, but in my opinion it's a waste of time in most cases, especially when you are new to it. Books will guide you through the basics of programming and language, so you will understand what basic instruments you have and how they work, which would help you to understand more complex things. If you're advanced programmer and you know one or two languages, you can read documentation, because you already know the basics and different languages have a lot of things in common, so in this case books would be boring. An example from my experience of learning Python: I've read "a byte of python", watched some free course, read a couple of articles and was sure that I understand decorators in Python. When the time has come I couldn't write my own decorator, so I've decided to read Mark Lutz book. It made everything clear, really it's a good book. So I think the other people can't help you to learn programming that way. What is really helpful is a good code review by somebody more experienced than you.
How can I learn to do this?
Would you recommend all 3 of the books? 
Yo! OP what headphones are those?
What's wrong with a pdf? It'll sit in your computer, that you use for python.
aren't we all??

I work for a Medical IT company and EMRs are so complex. 
You are correct. Though, it is very easy to use the C++ Qt documentation as the Python bindings are nearly identical to C++. I just find the C++ Qt documentation to be excellent. They have recently started generating [Python documentation](https://doc.qt.io/qtforpython/index.html) but it is not (yet?) up to the standard of the C++ documentation. 
I too bought the physical copy. Much better to highlight different areas and set stickers for references. But I'm analogue like that. 
The book is really cheap. The expenses of having someone ship you their copy and then send it back would be almost the same as just buying a new copy your self. You can even find used books for 10 USD on amazon. 
Can you name your books please? And how much do you recommend it? Thanks
Indeed.
[u/timberworks](https://www.reddit.com/user/timberworks) can you please share all the names and authors of interesting python books you own?
how can it be a *ritual* with brand new books? my nightly future plan i hop eto stick with but probably won't because i'm more interested in internet points for bullshit?
Is that Bose headphones? 
Said this on here a few days ago as well - \[[https://sopython.com/wiki/LPTHW\_Complaints](https://sopython.com/wiki/LPTHW_Complaints)\](this is a fair summary) of why it's not a great resource. It has (had? I know a lot changed in the Python 3 version) a lot of weird structures and choices in there. A fair number of confusing stack overflow questions come from people working through it. 
Slow down, slick. 
Good stuff. I'm following a similar track. There is huge potential for automation at my current job so I'm excited. 
In my Amazon wish list. Will be moving on to it when done with these. Glad to hear the recommendation. Thank you. 
I'm enrolled in one of Jose's courses as well. Glad to hear you liked it. 
Haha I like options
Automating the Boring Stuff is full of really good practical applications. Learning Python (the big one) has been great. It starts at the very beginning and builds the language. It's in depth and detailed. My skill level was probably a 3 out of 10 when I bought them.
That exactly my thought behind buying it essentially. I want to do the fun stuff. But I wanted to have a high level of comfort with the language in general. 
Nailed it. 
Go for it! Thanks and good luck. 
He snores louder than me. 
Thanks!
"Day of Mourning" has to be the video you're talking about. Haha. It's sad but I think at this point, being a Despised Icon fan reveals how old I'm getting.
Right on. Been listening since Via bro.
I appreciate the sentiment and know exactly what you mean. These books provide excellent information and direction and at this point in my education, I need that. As opposed to aimlessly typing code. I like having problems presented to me and working to solve them. These books are not just about reading only.
Still faster.
Haha nice! Keep it up. 
Highly recommended
Absolutely
Thanks dude!
Will do thank! Keep at it.
They are amazing. 
Sure are

/r/learnpython and read the sidebar.
I started learning python 1 month ago and I want to see your codes and execute the game. But I don't know how to play the game, I already downloaded the game, but what I have to do to play it?
On the contrary sir. I had no intention of 'flexing' as you so eloquently put it. It's a 'ritual' because that's what's it's called when do the same thing, at the same time, everyday. I shared because I'm excited and wanted to share that with a welcoming and friendly community that I have recently come in to. I couldn't care less about these bullshit points you referenced. There's people like you in every community. You're like the jock of the nerds.
That’s beautiful. We’re you doing projects like converting databases or information into easily read csv’s or spreadsheet? I thought of doing something similar for my sites. Mainly now I just use it to build scripts and robotics.
Books look new... Literally very new...
Isn't the point that you write the algorithm yourself? You download the map manually (would you even do this? Or just hard code a weighted graph?) Write the algorithm (s?) To use as desperate functions that take the weighted graph as parameters and write a `main()` function to time them. If you want to visualise it: I personally don't have any experience in creating graphics with Python, I would probably use the pygame library and a `for` loop to display the graph and then draw the path of the algorithm on top. Your question is quite vague however I hope this at least gives you some guidance; it would be helpful if you rewrote your question to first list exactly what the program should do and then explain what you don't understand / need help with.
Nowhere?
&gt;Your question is quite vague however I hope this at least gives you some guidance; it would be helpful if you rewrote your question to first list exactly what the program should do and then explain what you don't understand / need help with. The main thing that I have an issue with is the visualization part, I can write the algorithm. I'll read about pygame and see if it matches what I need. Thanks
What books do y'all recommend? 
are you sure that's not a Rython?
networkx will probably be useful. It's cool to use that to visualise it. Your assignment is to write Dijkstra's algorithm, not a network visualisation package. 
Aimlessly typing code is exactly what you should do.
No, I'm a fragment of you imagination
This is a really great reminder and encouragement to new programmers; learning is a journey we never complete. My own ‘journey’ with Python began in 2002, but I didn’t really ‘learn’ Python until I accepted that it always be something I’m learning and practicing, rather than something I simply ‘know.’
So to get the ball rolling, can I use the rat book in the picture complemented with the automate book?
Not so fast, nowadays you need to apply to Twitter for a developer account and explain the purpose of what you are doing with the data and they manually review it.
Hey what about python: the complete reference and learn python 3 hard way ? I have beginning python and python Bible free ebook.any suggestions on python book ?
Well said!
Ah yes, a desk job.

Yep, O'Reilly stuff is almost always pretty good, and Automate the Boring Stuff is great.

Will do, thank you.
Everything. School projects, github, any stuff you've done on your own, etc. You need to give the interview some handle to start a conversation with. "So, tell me about this pypyodbc db thing. Was there a GUI involved there? Did you write the SQL? Multi-user or single-user?" etc. Things that display a unique skill are especially important to mention. "I didn't see anything on his resume that mentioned GUIs. I guess he doesn't know anything about that."
If a basic map-reduce structure fits your problem, stick with [`concurrent.futures` from the standard library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html). If you actually do need a more complex async structure, Trio is the clearest way of writing that I've ever found.
Hey, I'm looking for a new laptop so I'm curious what Acer have you got? Also nice to see a new Pythonista. 
That is a rat. That book is misstitled. 
I'm an absolute beginner in Python. Will this book help with the basics and then introduce me to more advanced concepts or is it for those who already know python?
Wouldn't gather work as you describe? ``` async def main(): result1, result2 = await asyncio.gather( asyncio.ensure_future(task1()), asyncio.ensure_future(task2()), ) ... # Then the same again? asyncio.run(main()) ```
I made a Twitter Bot to reply with an MP4 link to the stroke order of the requested Kanji. Test it out @eiKanjiBot
but are you writing code as you go?? That's will make a huge difference as to whether you retain the information or not.
I have that book
r/learnpython next time Use one print statement and concatenate the strings
Thanks for mentioning impractical. I've added to my wishlist

 print("The equasion of the line is y = {0}x + {1}".format(s, b) I think
Python IS a great place to start, although I'd argue that a low level language like C is better. What I'm saying is that it's unnecessary to work your way through entire textbooks on the language unless you plan on becoming a python dev. It really only takes a few days to learn syntax, style, and functionality of a language. A better way to learn programming is to tackle projects spanning over several different programming domains. 
I would argue that C is a better place to start because of the emphasis it places on low level mechanics like memory allocation and such. It's more friendly when it comes to learning about the mathematical aspects of programming like algorithmic complexity. 
I wrote mypyc.
how do you do that? (sorry for wrong subreddit)
Definitely!
Yes it starts at the very beginning and builds on the concepts. 
Thanks I'm hooked! It's an Acer Spin 5 I believe. Not a bad little machine at all. 
Thank you. I've forgot about numba. Looks super cool. Seems like there has been a lot of efort around Python to make it run faster. Maybe the effort will hop into Python itself one day.
In python3 you can just comma-separate variables: print(”text here”, var1, ”more text”, var2)
print("text_1" + " - " + "text_2") ==&gt;text_1 - text_2 print("text_1\ntext_2") ==&gt;text_1 ==&gt;text_2 a = 1 b = 3 print(a + " - " + b) ==&gt;1 - 3 
Learn from "Python Crash Course". It's by the same author of "Automate the Boring Stuff With Python", and is basically the prequel to "Automate the Boring Stuff With Python". You also get some included projects to do, and learn everything about Python. 
If you're on a Mac, you should be able to execute: `pbpaste | python -c` I know there are equivalent commands to pbpaste on Linux too.
Damn you are right. I've interchanged the expressions. Well good you got the idea. The Cython seems to be the way to go if I wanna take an advantage of static typing. But on the other hand then the project will have many C dependencies if I move a lot of code into Cython. Is there a way how to "mount" my C extensions to the rest of Python code so they build from fresh code once I install or build my app? Some setuptools hack?
Yeah. Python Crash Course is the way to go. I'm reading Python Crash Course in addition to taking a Team Treehouse course on Python.
Why would you bother? You must be typing your script somewhere. Type it in a text editor, save your file, and run your file
Do you really need to go so in depth in python. I mainly search syntax and I'm working on AI.
It's likely the issue you are coming across is trying to use Selenium with multi-threading or asyncio. For using lots of browsers and rendering pages, you are likely going to want to use Selenium hub to manage your multiple browser instances, and then you can easily use threads to communicate with these managed browsers. &amp;#x200B; A better way with multiprocessing would be to use the concurrent futures implementation and simply submit the function you want to run to in parallel the process pool with submit. Though you still might have issues with selenium locally. &amp;#x200B; If you are wanting to do async operations with a browser, I would recommend the Pyppeteer library which can be used to render multiple pages within multi browser tabs with a little bit of work. I wrote myself a small library around Pyppeteer to make the job easier for myself. 
About to start soon, thanks for your advice. Have a great year!
Heads up, If you're a student Microsoft offers a 2 month free trial. I think the courses are a good introduction in most cases. Definitely enough to get you started with any given topic. I found it very helpful when I needed to learn R for work. I haven't experimented with it yet, but DataCamp also offer a catalog of projects to work on to improve your skills. Seems like a fun structured way to learn. Good luck!
You can format strings a few ways in python 3.6+ &amp;#x200B; f-strings (3.6+) `print(f"The equation of the line is y={s}x + {b}")` &amp;#x200B; str.format() `print("The equation of the line is y={}x + {}".format(s, b))` You can also do these indexed if you want `print("The equation of the line is y={0}x + {1}".format(s, b))` or `print("The equation of the line is y={1}x + {0}".format(b, s))` Note that the indices flipped in the second example &amp;#x200B; % notation (This is depreciated in 3.1+ in favor of the other two) `print("The equation of the line is y=%sx + %s" % (s, b))` &amp;#x200B; If you just want to concatenate strings, you can do either of the following `print("The equation of the line is y=", s, "x + ", b)` `print("The equation of the line is y=" + str(s) + s + "x + " + str(b))` &amp;#x200B; The easiest and cleanest (imo) are the f-strings, but if you need backwards compatibility, str.format() works for all of python 3, and (to my knowledge), the %'s have been around forever. Direct string concatenation is a bit dirty, formatting is clean. Hope this helps &lt;3
If you are truly trying to solve the problem they present and not just parroting the code provided, I would agree with you... otherwise you should cover the basic syntax and work on creating your own things, at the very least do their problem then come up with another way it may effect you and implement it or create additional test cases to break it and then fix it yourself.
Yeah just to chime in - Fluent Python was HUGELY helpful for me in pushing through "beginner's python" and into intermediate. The right book for that can be very hard to find - but after you're done with the introduction books and have written enough spaghetti, go read it! (Spaghetti stage is 100% required, don't worry about it!)

Authentication is definitely a must before I go live with the project. I've been trying different scenarios to make sure the basics are solid right now. Do you have a preference in what authentication method you'd use in this type of project?
Over the last four years I recorded my weight on the iPhone health app at least half the days. I also carry my phone almost everywhere so I have pretty good records of the number of steps I was taking. So as a project to learn pandas/matplotlib I have been trying to show the correlation between how many steps I take and my weight gain and loss.

To learn anything just pick what you want to learn and stick with it. There is no magic course or sauce that will make you better. Consistency is king. If you want to try different courses to learn Python try them but make sure you are learning python consistently and by consistently i mean studying 4+ times a week. &amp;#x200B; I quickly just read Datacamp's syllabus and it appears data oriented (go figure!), I am not convinced this is the best way to learn programming or Python. &amp;#x200B; For the best grounding, I would learn the basic python syntax from Codecademy/Coursera/Datacamp then work through the sections of Automate the Boring Stuff that you might find useful. &amp;#x200B; Then find some programming challenges to get the grey matter working. I'd recommend this two lists on (basic)\[[https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-algorithm-scripting](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-algorithm-scripting)\] and (intermediate)\[[https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/intermediate-algorithm-scripting](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/intermediate-algorithm-scripting)\] challenges on freeCodeCamp. They're based in JavaScript but try them in Python. &amp;#x200B; Then I would progress to tools that are more specific for example NumPy and Pandas. &amp;#x200B; If you are more likely to spend your time learning if you do the DataCamp course then complete that course. &amp;#x200B; Obligatory /r/learnpython is a better place for this question.
I thought of that but everything I read says that globals in Flask is a bad idea and can cause problems down the line. I think in the end, storing the value to a file is likely the best bet as it will persist through a reboot as well. Thanks for the help!
Pretty much, yes. As you learn to code, you'll go through many phases of writing stuff that becomes too complex and tangled to be rescued, or sort of "terrible knots" of code that are hard to debug and low performance.
Those books look like they’ve never been opened. 
Been at it with these books for a month.
I agree completely. 
8pm-10pm is typical
I'm surprised as no one here mentioned the *Python Crash Course* also by *No starch Press*. Just started learning programming with it, I must say it's awesome. Completed 7 Chapters and am excited to check out the projects.
Well, nothing about writing a GUI is easy. If you're looking for a solid cross platform solution, I'd recommend looking into GTK.
Finishing the Advent of Code challenges. https://adventofcode.com
Sure. Check the built in eval.
Depends a little bit on what kind of client you're going to use to interact with it. The most important part is that whatever you use to host the app has https/ssl setup properly to protect any secrets you may pass back and forth from the api. Like most garage door openers you could set a pin in an env var when you launch the app and require all requests to have the appropriate pin with a decorator on each view function or some kind of pre-routing hook in flask. You could also have an auth endpoint that takes a PIN or username/password combo and then will hand back the client a token using flask\_jwt or flask\_jwt\_extended that can be then used to access protected endpoints.
This is the easiest GUI library I've worked with. https://github.com/dddomodossola/remi
Yes, thanks. I passed that stage of the process. 
This is the best answer that I've ever gotten from this question, and I have some follow up questions. I hope this isnt a waste of your time, and I appreciate the help. You say to include everything programming related. Does this mean that I should not place my current work experience that doesnt necessarily connect to programming. Like I made some programs for my job, but it wasn't my job and I was 'talked' to about it being outside of scope. When placing everything on the resume, how does one do that. I have experience with GUIs, several languages and frameworks, etc. But without the, I guess, "framework" of (job title) [company] /time in position/, how do work it all in. In my current resume, for example, I give my github at the top with my name and number and I'm not sure if that's a good place. 
Thanks for your elaborated response! I wasn't really looking for a magic course but some opinions on Datacamp itself. Just trying to get some feedback from those who have done it before I pay for it. I know there is no magic pill to learn anything but thanks again! i'll definitely check out those links
I really enjoy watching Raymond Hettinger videos, but I just realized that I don't ever make notes about them or code along with him so I don't retain things as well as I should. I wind up googling something while I wonder "didn't I see something like this" 
I'm reading that book too. Python crash course is by Eric Matthes and Automate the boring stuff is by Al Sweigart. Not the same author but both are published by No Starch Press(their books usually get good reviews).
&gt; Like I made some programs for my job, but it wasn't my job and I was 'talked' to about it being outside of scope. I'd turn that into a positive. "They weren't looking for a software dev, but I kept seeing ways to automate and streamline. Now I'm looking for a position more in line with my interests." &gt; without the, I guess, "framework" of (job title) [company] /time in position/, how do work it all in. I always have a "Technologies" or similar heading somewhere where I can dump things like that. SQL, Flask, shell script, GUI design, debugging skills, etc, etc. You can break it down by language vs skill if you have a lot of them. I think I usually see github links in the contact info section. If you highlight a particular project under experience, I would link that one specifically there.
The last line really makes a lot of sense and I'm thankful for you pointing it out. Instead of job experience, use the same format to highlight projects. Thank you very much for your time!!
For me this just installed stuff as root within ```/root/.local/bin/```. Essentially it's just getting installed in the directory of root user, still unsafe, apparently. And this is on Ubuntu, which, going by the stats is pretty common use among beginners, hence I thought it'd be cool to write a note. 😅
Ah ok the post sounded like you were returning to Twitter scraping after a long hiatus, with the dev approval requirement being only 6 months old now.
That book is the reason I have a career at all.
I just did a pr yesterday to include helpful decorator functions :)
Great!!
Oh. That's strange. I run Ubuntu as well and it installs in my ~/.local/ dir, not root. The only way it would have permission to write to your root dir is if you ran it as root user in the first place. This is definitely not a good idea.
I have two sections in my resume; Professional Experience, and Personal Experience. It goes a long way.
That's a good idea. Thank you. 
So, you don't get any permission errors when installing with ```pip install pkg --user```? I could only install stuff using sudo, else I'd get the error. Reinstalled pip a few times and for good measure even my Ubuntu install. Only this nifty trick worked out finally.
Reading those books won't help you writing good software. Languages are only a tool. You master it while using. 
I'm not super happy writing classes. I have a team member who has been pushing hard for composable functions and they work **really** well. I've mainly been writing classes to encapsulate the crap-ton of arguments each job requires. But I've been trying to push for encapsulating arguments into small objects using \`namedtuple\`. rather than a long list of arguments. 
Obviously
No. I have tried this on a number of machines as well. I do this at work and home. Using the distribution package for pip is definitely safe and correct. Maybe there is something wrong with your setup...?
Airflow actually! But Airflow has a number of assumptions that don't always apply. The characteristic date / execution\_date setup is less flexible than a system that introspects and heals itself. We use Airflow, but only as a GUI to run jobs and check logs. The actual ETL code lives in a library that gets packed up into the docker container. Then Airflow runs the latest container via a thin \`DockerRunOperator\` (which is just the \`BashOperator\` shelling out with a templated \`docker run analytics:latest bin/load\_foo.py --arg value --arg2 value2 ...\` command. Now, our Airflow instance doesn't need to know much more than a dict of job configuration that creates tasks under DAGs translated into cli arguments.
The problem with just using a variable, is it depends on a particular instance of python remaining running. If the flask server restarts, it will forget. Or if you're running more than one flask server process, they may not be storing the same variable. Using a database (sqlite to start, and later something like postgresql or mysql) is the typical way of solving this problem. But it could be overkill in your situation, and be just more stuff for you to have to learn. Keep it up! You're doing great :D
How's that "Learning Python book" ?
It's fine to use your existing computer.
My office mantra is "ॐ भूर्भुवः स्वः तत्सवितुर्वरेण्यं । भर्गो देवस्य धीमहि धियो यो नः प्रचोदयात्".
The \`@lru\_cache\` decorator from \`\[functools\]([https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#functools.lru\_cache](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#functools.lru_cache))\`. It caches results for a given set of arguments to a function, and it does so by annotating the function (woo, everything's an object).
Can I get a translation? 
No in the original post...or you wrote both. Mypyc doesn’t exist anyways.
I definitely like it the most. Do you know how to get the help output to [render the default value of a `SwitchAttr`](https://github.com/tomerfiliba/plumbum/issues/433).
It's the [Gayatri Matnra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gayatri_Mantra). (I'm just being funny. You said "office mantra", and it was obvious you were more office than mantra, so I went more mantra than office. Maybe it would be funnier to go full office-mantra. Like: Copier, break, mail -- the three rooms The divine voice of the middle manager The serenity of a broken stapler. could be translated to Sanskrit. Then, some dumb punk would get a tattoo of it, and ...) 
**Gayatri Mantra** The Gāyatrī, also known as the Sāvitrī mantra, is a highly revered mantra from the Rig Veda (Mandala 3.62.10), dedicated to Savitr, the sun deity. Gāyatrī is the name of the Vedic meter in which the verse is composed. Its recitation is traditionally preceded by oṃ and the formula bhūr bhuvaḥ svaḥ, known as the mahāvyāhṛti, or "great (mystical) utterance". Sacred feminine Gayathri hereself created the Gayatri mantra to help five elements of nature to be on its course. *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Python/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28
Mypy is not part of the core language. It’s also not the only use for type hints. Mypy is also quite popular, so what did we all miss? Also, what do you have against async? I doesn’t affect me, so I don’t care. It makes some problems much faster, so what’s the problem?
Make a genetic algorithm. Or make a space ship gravity program. Use a simple graphics library to make cartoon graphics for both. Or make something that choices random nouns and verbs from a list to make snetences. Or make something that makes music. There is one guy on youtube with the best playlist for simple python exame. REALLY simple. Hang on.

Nice and very humble answer, 100% agree. There is always more to learn.
Learn about github, sounds like just what you need
Hm, my approach was to use the PythonOperator class and build functions that receive a database connection. It gets around the need for bash.
If you wanna open-source it, then use a service like GitHub. However, in order to have private repositories, you'd have to pay. This is where GitLab comes, I really like it. It uses Git as well (obviously, since it's called GitLab), but it allows you to have private repositories. For an example, you can upload your releases, and have the user download the releases directly from the website.
"You must learn about the Tkinter, if you are to come with me to Alderaan." (check this out http://effbot.org/tkinterbook/ )
Is there any benefit to : no_duplicates = list(dict.fromkeys(&lt;list&gt;)) vs: no_duplicates = list(set(&lt;list&gt;)) It does the same thing, right?
Most commonly used to refer to an implementation that relies heavily on global variables, little to no method encapsulation, frequent verbatim repeating of code, and especially huge chains of control structures (if/else).
 &gt;&gt;&gt; list_ = [3, 2, 1] &gt;&gt;&gt; list(set(list_)) [1, 2, 3] &gt;&gt;&gt; list(dict.fromkeys(list_)) [3, 2, 1]
While I’m not a Python expert and am just beginning to learn more advanced parts of it, it works great for me although using libraries/modules can be tricky
Thanks, my test data was sorted (of course). 
Open a system terminal, activate your conda/virtualenv and install the packages you need afterwards. [Here](https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/wiki/Working-with-packages-and-environments-in-Spyder) you can find a more complete guide about how to install packages and make Spyder detect them.
