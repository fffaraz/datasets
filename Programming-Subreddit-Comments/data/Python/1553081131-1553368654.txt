did you mean to put your access tokens in the git repo?
Amazing, are you planning on publishing the source code? 
Admire your dedication. It’s daunting, but also inspiring to see as someone who has only recently started learning python. 
[removed]
Haha yeah this is why its a little hacky. Those aren't actually the tokens, the actual tokens are encrypted before they are saved and they are updated every use. So even if you did crack the encryption those tokens expired a long time ago. &amp;#x200B; I didn't really know how to solve this problem without saving the tokens in the project folder. I was originally just pickling a dictionary containing the tokens. I tried having the tokens set as environment variables (which would have been the optimal solution) but I was having difficulty with setting os.environ, apparently setting variables using os.environ doesn't actually set them or something and the tokens weren't persisting when the flask app restarted.
Good bot

Hi. It's maya plugin, so maya uses OpenGL under the hood. 
Hi. Unfortunately no. Right now I cannot port app to other 3D software and Engines all alone, but in the future, yes, definitely.
Of course this is a lot of work but cool to hear about the future.
Ok thanks.
Thank You! I cannot. I have to check all the licences of the libraries and if some of the textures or assets are copyrighted. I don't think I will have any problems sharing it now, but still I have to be 100% positive.
Stop making a fuss about it, I found it very interesting, and the title isn't misleading, it is just perfect for newcomers who want to create something of interest.
cool project nonetheless, thanks for sharing.
Updating and improving some of the scripts I use for automation at work. Unfortunately, one of the key websites we use doesn't have an API and won't work well with just bare requests, so it's a lot of selenium. Adding error handling mainly so that I can reduce the amount of time I have to spend watching things to make sure they work correctly.

I mean the heavy lifting is still down in lower level languages, but still cool project!
Use [configparser](https://docs.python.org/3/library/configparser.html) to save the keys in a .cfg file, and .gitignore to not commit the config file. 
Working on my first real python project for my networks class. I'm building a packet sniffer. I'm a little nervous about it because I did terrible on the midterm so I need to do great on this project to make sure I pass the class 😥
Well, not really. After everything is calculated Maya API calls create the scene, but when I remove Maya API calls and use PyOpenGL functions instead modelling and render is much faster. Most of the heavy lifting is done with numpy, but yes, numpy under the hood is actually C.
Python is the standarding scripting language of Maya. Do the people saying it needs C++ even know what Maya is?
Program for creating web interactive indoor/outdoor layout maps. 1. Create layout map in MS Excel, define column widths, row heights, cell values, colors etc. 2. Using python produce all this information in json file 3. Using javascript render everything on the webpage so that everything appears exactly as in Excel + attach defined event handlers to it etc etc.
Hmm, you can also put several (or all) your user endpoints into the same users module. What advantage would provide using classes?
Don't tell anyone, but Python under the hood is also C ;)
Just posted it again (this time to the docs). Let's see if someone sees it 😂
This post would be more topical in /r/pythontips 
Most of the commercial Maya plug-in is written in C++ because it is much faster for doing math (linear algebra and numerical methods). However, I tried to use numpy for all the calculations and looks like it's speed is amazing. Note that to generate one tree, with tens of thousands of vertices and quads, with clean topology and UV maps takes less than 1 second, and app is not even multithreaded, just heavily vectorized.
True :) It's still amazing though that I didn't have to spend 1 sec waiting for it to compile
Have a look at [Exercism](https://exercism.io/tracks/python).
Some choose C++ for the express purpose of protecting their code.
Read "automate the boring stuff with Python" in this subreddit's sidebar. It's a book, the whole purpose of, is to teach beginners this exact thing.
True. However Cython is now very simple to use. It convert Python code to C code and then compiles it :)
Ahh cool didn't know about that module. I could have done the same with what I've got but I got lazy and didn't want to ftp the keys to the server every time I deployed. &amp;#x200B;
Yep. Doable. Fdf generation, pdftk, python.
What I meant was that if you wrote all the components in native python you wouldn't be able to get such real-time performance. The packages you use have wrappers to languages that are written in lower-level compiled languages like c/c++ [...]. Heck even numpy is heavily coded within these languages. So when people say `don't use python for 3D graphics` they refer to native python, which is a `True` ( ;) ) statement. 
That is True! :)
Got it! This is very helpful. Do you have a link to your project? It would be cool to see what you've done.
Wow this sounds great! Is this acting in the same way geckodriver does when I use selenium in Python?
Thanks! 
Yeah, I find numpy is generally no worse than 2-4x slower than a compiled language, provided you're able to put everything into a vectorized form. The advantage of something like C or Fortran is that they let you unravel things into index/loop form and keep the high performance, and sometimes that's a tidier way to do things.

How amazing it is that we can freely use so simple and powerful library that is just 2-4x times slower than compiled C or Fortran code. And, it is used everywhere, Scipy uses it, OpenCV, PyTorch and list goes on and on.

That's true, but when you break things down into loops &amp; arithmetic operations, Fortran isn't really any tougher than Python, and generally takes less thought. To get things to run fast in Python, you need to work on a higher level of abstraction and think hard about how to vectorise everything and dump the load onto the numpy library. To run fast in Fortran, you can just write out the maths explicitly and it'll work.
Damn, that is True. I know at least 10 places in which I have overheads because I didn't want to add Python loops so I split things to weird numpy steps. At one points, when this becomes more complex I will have to solve some things low level. But, for now, weeeeeeeeee
Yeah, I guess I'm less attacking Python and more defending lower level languages - every now and again you get people saying "what's the point of Fortran/etc if you can just do it in Python??" but every tool has its costs and benefits.
Can't believe Ruby beat us by 1%

Top level comment with some explanations. Here is a [very dirty github link](https://github.com/SamyBencherif/crumb/blob/master/crumb.py) Here are my (hehehe) [very crumby docs](https://github.com/SamyBencherif/crumb/blob/master/doc.md)
One is a database, the other an ORM... There are many databases, and other ORMs.
Are you lost with ML or ML w Python? Let's put that another way: are you trying to implement ML techniques you have heard about for a specific purpose, say as an add on to another project you may be building with Python? Or are you trying to get started with ML and you have heard that Python is the best language in which to do this (it is)? I recommend that either way you think about ML not as a set of tools (sklearn, keras, etc) that can be implemented in Python and thus used with other Python tools but rather as a theory-based practice often implemented in Python. With that understanding I recommend this book: https://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/ It is written in R but that doesn't matter. The numerical libraries used by R and Python and the data structures used by the two are nearly identical. The point of this is book is to give a strong theoretical foundation to the practice of machine learning. This book is dense. If you've never read a math book outside of a course before, I recommend the following. Read it once without trying to understand every detail. Just read it and take it in. You don't even need to read it all. This path is a sort of osmosis. You might watch the videos for the book by the authors that can be found from that site. Then set it down and do some coding in Python. There are so many online resources for this. It doesn't matter. Just do some ml coding in Python (preferably in sklearn using Jupyter). Six months later read the book again. This time try to absorb more of it. Wash, rinse, repeat. ML is a graduate-level field of computer science. It takes time, commitment, and intellectual maturity to grok the field. Patience and persistence are the way to get there. Good luck! 
I see.. i guess i'm not yet educated enlugh on the topic as to ask any further questions.. thanks for the explanation!
Why would you use a virtualenv in a Dockerfile?
Shameless plug for an awesome OSS tree generator Blender plugin I've been contributing to for a while: https://github.com/friggog/tree-gen
1. System python packages conflict with packages in your virtualenv. 2. For multi-stage Docker builds, where you have compiler etc. in first stage, and then copy over compiled code (Python C extensions etc.) into second stage image that doesn't have gcc etc so gives you a smaller image. In this case, installing directly with pip means some files end up in /usr/bin, others in site-packages, so it's hard to copy everything over. Virtualenv solves that since everything is one directory.
No need to activate it, just use the Python in it.
Thank you for replying man I tried udacity course on machine learning But couldn’t understand a word . Im a good python programmer with experience of 4 years Will try what u said Thank you once again 
There are a couple of good reasons, some objective and some not. Objective ones: * Performance and resource usage: This is crucial for applications on low-end devices (IoT, embedded, ...). * Commercial support with long track-record: A Qt app written ten years ago still runs today. Commercial support is available if needed. Most web technologies aren't around that long and probably will not be. * Write front-end and back-end with the same tools. * Native cross-platform support. Especially on mobile, apps are still more integrated than web apps. Subjective: * I find it significantly harder to write web apps than a Qt GUI. * I prefer not to use JavaScript for most parts of the frontend. * QML &gt; HTML5 In the near future, it probably will be more or less the same with WebAssembly. Qt 5.13 will run in a web browser.
Thanks. I will forward this info to the PyQt and PySide devs.
But if you replace cpython with pypy, then it is no longer c... and becomes faster! ;)
Not into b). I mean it's good that is there as a default fallback, but it's far from being useable for more than small tools. Nothing you would use in a product in 2019 at least.
Thanks that you point that out. It doesn't look like many Python devs share this opinion.
Working on an internal module for our analyst to simplify some of the complexities with searching and loading data from the data lake. &amp;#x200B; If anyone knows much about getting a module to import data from an external config file (as it refreshes more often then the module will) any help would be much appreciated!
It does if you use mypy :-)
Looks down to me :O
I've recently started using pysimplegui and find it to be really convenient. It handles a lot of the administrivia of managing windows, event binding etc. It's not suitable for everything (complex UIs with custom widgets, for instance) but for normal "I need my user to be able to fill out a form of inputs and detect the values and respond to button clicks" sorts of things it works nicely. https://pypi.org/project/PySimpleGUI/ It also plays nice with pyinstaller. 
I'm the project lead for Plotly Express... AMA :)
PyPy is written in RPython, which is written in C :)
That's awesome, source code?
thanks for answering! I use flask-sqlalchemy which i guess creates new instances of sqlalchemy using the db models? is that related to the functionality that marshmallow provides?
thanks for answering! :)

tkinter cannot be run as a thread nor can you make direct calls to tkinter from another thread. It's simply not a multi-threaded SDK. You'll need to use something like a queue.Queue to communicate between your tkinter code and other threads. &amp;#x200B;
How far along are you in your Python education? Is this a question about a GUI program you wish to write, or more general? And what does "good GUI" mean to you? One way to start is to use [PySimpleGUI](http://www.PySimpleGUI.org). This package will allow you to write code one time and then run it on 4 different underlying GUI frameworks, should you not like the look and feel of one of them. You can run tkinter, WxPython, Qt, and Remi (runs in your browser). It's simple enough for a beginner to use right away, and has enough depth to create custom, multi-window, somewhat complex GUIs. Of course it's worth it 😃

can you suggest an example or any reference site something like that? i have never used queue before
[I used it in this PySimpleGUI program](https://repl.it/@PySimpleGUI/Async-With-Queue-Communicationspy). It's not tkinter, but the same kind of mechanism is at work. Multiple threads are started and the GUI reads the Queue to get "work to do". I didn't learn this technique from a site, but rather I read a tip to use this queue.Queue object. I read the official Python docs on it and then experimented around with it. Hopefully the way I'm using them is an acceptable one!

Does this work in offline mode?
Subscribe to it for more updates !
Yes! It uses offline mode by default: no API keys, no logins. Except for mapbox maps, but that's not Plotly-related :)
Super cool thanks for sharing!
This looks great! Can't wait to try it out.
I wish plotly was all I needed for plotting, but ever now and then I find a hole/something it can't do. It usually ends up being a known issue with some bug report thats been open for months to years with no activity on it. Its these types of things that make plotly very frustrating. 
Thank you for the suggestions. Ill focus on the NLP algorithm and build the interface with flask which I feel more comfortable with.
This is incredible thanks soooooooo much! I'll implement this now and yes, this is my first ever package!
Awesome project! 
I usually create a dummy object with `is` comparison for instantiations. I think that is *pretty* clear. I have also had the case where I need my sentinel to be a string such as if I am parsing a stream and I want to know when to end. Then, I will usually use something random (e.g. `uuid4()` or a random string). I can then parse (and maybe use a `deque`) bytes until it is my termination. This requires that I communicate the random ID. Or, if that can't happen, I can generate it and fix it in the code and hope that it doesn't happen randomly (or with intentionally but I am usually not worried about untrusted inputs) Of course, the better thing to do is make the protocol specify how many bytes to read but sometimes that is just *too* easy! (Or I do not know it ahead of time). 
Man, you are super active on reddit, you've seen my post and have been pretty much an asshole the entire week. Are you capable of reflecting on what you write? Do you understand that what you are saying is not appropriate by any standard? &amp;#x200B; Why are you posting here?
I saved the article to read later. Having *not* read it yet, I wonder if views have changed given that the article is dated 2012
I'm sorry this has been a frustrating experience for you :( We try hard to triage issues effectively but sometimes we miss stuff. Are there any particular issues that come to mind?
Sooo coooooolll!! I've been using plotly for a little bit and I'm stoked to try out this new stuff!!
Is there any chance a team member could flag some bug/enhancement issues with a "good first issue" label? I've never contributed to open-source projects before, but I really appreciate what you folks have done and I'd like to help out if I can!
Most of this makes sense to me, the only thing I don't understand is args, since it doesn't seem to have a value. Thanks for your help!
Sure, we can put some effort into that! Plotly Express at the moment isn't very beginner-friendly but it's built on top of [https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py) and [https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js), both of which have mature development cycles and should be easier to contribute to, depending on your language of choice :)
Turn it around 
Hey, do you use a virtual environment? If not, you should. 
There was a big list of issues with polar plots that was opened in 2016. It looks like it was finally fixed in Jan. 2018, but there are still [issues](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/issues/2255) with the 2.0 version such as not being able to set the angular range. [Log Axes for histograms] (https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/issues/1844) is one I came across recently. There was also some other issue with routing in dash. I don't remember the details and can't find the github issue. 
Was this a government contract?

This is a keeper introduction. Sentinel objects and Enums are much more reliable than an ambiguous `None` in most cases.
Under enough hoods, it's all assmebly
Have you looked at the 'curses' module for doing interesting things eith the terminal window?
You can do this with chr(), ord() and range: az = \['('+chr(i)+')' for i in range(ord('a'),ord('z')+1)\] aazz = \['('+chr(i)+chr(i)+')' for i in range(ord('a'),ord('z')+1)\] probably a way to roll that all into one statement, or just combine the lists. 
That's impressive that you're tackling something of that magnitude as a newcomber. Can I ask how long you've been learning Python? Any tips..?
I went through very similar issues when I was working on my first web interface. When you execute php print.py from a command line on your server you are running the php program with the user account you are logged in with. Then php will run python under the same user account. Which works fine because your account probably owns print.py so you have execute access to it. When you execute your php script by accessing it on in a browser you are no longer executing from your user account. The php and python script are going to be executing from the general web user account. If you are running an Apache web server this account is called www-data. www-data is only going to have read permissions to most things. So unless you have explicitly allowed it, then www-data does not have execute permission for your python script. So you need to allow your python script to be executable by www-data. For testing purposes you can just set the execute permission to anyone and test your program but this raises security concerns so make sure you limit the permissions again once you verify its working. Also if you are running Apache then you can check for errors at /var/log/apache2/error.log and it will tell you if there are permission issues or if it is something else. 
I have, but the problem is that curses support only works on Linux/Mac. I've developed the `bext` module which provides cross-platform goto/size/clear functions and colored text (it's mostly built on top of the colorama module), but since all I needed was clearing the screen, I decided to use the cls/clear commands instead. A nice thing about using periods for fireflies is that the flickering isn't that noticeable.
Gotcha
&gt; curses support only works on Linux/Mac I don't get it, what's the issue? :) 
That’s cool. Enjoyed just watching you use it. Would be cool to allow the user to have an “end” state and then the program would start from a seed (or whatever) then grow randomly to the end state. Could be cool to watch a forest grow, die, then renew. Thanks for making this.

Like Linux, macOS is built similar to many UNIX-like operating systems, and curses is an old text cursor-controlling library for UNIX-like operating systems. Windows' Command Prompt program has a completely different history, and while several curses-emulating libraries are made for it, Python's curses library doesn't really support it. (Most of the Python core developers are on Mac/Linux, and it just wasn't a priority.) So to put it bluntly: there just aren't a lot of people asking for it, it's kind of niche thing, and the no one wants to do the work to get it added to Python. Anyway, I like the API of `bext` better anyway: bext.goto(x, y), bext.size(), bext.clear(), bext.fg('red'), bext.bg('blue'). It's pretty simple to fit it all in your head.
df2 = pd.merge(df1, geolocalizacionT, on='ESTACION', how='left') &amp;#x200B; CSV files are easier to work with than txt files for me. 
I was kidding, I'm mostly talking about the less-sane and sometimes arcane coding standards on Win32 systems that have still crept into modern Windows development.
This might be easier done with a mail merge using Excel.
Here's a suggestion. Make a global boolean like "online" then in your function is_connected replace l.config... with Online = true and online = false. So now you have removed tkinter from your second thread and you can communicate using this boolean. Then in your main while loop you can do if online then l.config ... I think you can see where I'm going with this? I can type of out more if you want. The last thing is remove top.mainloop from the bottom. As you have it now top.mainloop will prevent your while loop from running. Instead add top.update_idletasks() Check out this post if you want an explanation. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29158220/tkinter-understanding-mainloop/29158947 I hope this helps.

I use PostgreSQL for my databases and interact with them via Pandas. I'm pretty happy with those tools. 
Such a fun idea to use different soups...stealing that!
Do both of those work with embedded databases? I know what PostgreSQL is kind of but I've never heard of Pandas. Do you think they would work for the scenario I added to my main post in the edit?
Security by obscurity (until you decide to kill your performance by obfuscation of the binary)
PyCharm
Yeah I guess PostgreSQL is embedded. My data live in tables on the server. Pandas is a Python module that I can connect to the DBs and with queries I can pull chunks of data into a dataframe within Python and make plots or run analyses. Its pretty fast and powerful.

Thank You! Yeah, those features would be awesome. However, I have no idea how to do that right now :D But, in the future I will have to implement that somehow
Yeah I've been looking at WMI for the moment, but 'user friendly' it certainly is not; it is going to take me a bit to figure out how to get it working.
Under enough hoods it's all.... Tardigrade 
Can you tell me the answer to a second question? I have no idea that one of them is more efficient than the other. 
Thank you for your answer :) That isn't working etiher. It gives me this error: "ValueError: The column label 'ESTACION' is not unique. For a multi-index, the label must be a tuple with elements corresponding to each level." &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
Thats really cool! Thanks for sharing
Amazing
Here's how to make it (yes I'm very aware this is a crude attempt) import turtle t=turtle.Turtle() t.speed(1000) t.hideturtle() turtle.Screen().bgcolor("red") t.color("yellow") t.begin_fill() t.left(90) t.left(45) t.forward(150) t.left(90) t.forward(35) t.right(90) t.forward(35) t.right(90) t.forward(90) t.right(90) t.forward(35) t.right(90) t.forward(35) t.left(90) t.forward(150) t.right(90) t.forward(20) t.penup() t.end_fill() t.right(135) t.forward(15) t.right(270) t.forward(100) t.right(135) t.pendown() t.begin_fill() t.forward(60) t.forward(40) t.right(45) for i in range(100): t.forward(1.5) t.left(1.25) t.right(200) for i in range(100): t.forward(1.5) t.right(1) t.left(45) t.forward(10) t.penup() t.forward(20) t.pendown() t.forward(70) t.left(90) t.forward(10) t.left(90) t.forward(100) t.end_fill()
My professor said the for loop was the right answer. You can do it with both, the reason she said for loop is the answer is because it's a definite loop. A while loop on the other hand is not, but you can add a counter.
Doesn't the title of the slide tell you where to find the answer?
You can get the data from openhardwere monitor. It has a http api
Maybe change the colour next time ;)
It would be great to see some examples of how it integrates with Dash... this could be exactly what I'm looking for. I've always found plotting within a dash app to be a little tedious, maybe this solves that for me!

Yeah, i eventually figured out how to do this, tho the problem is it requires me to have openhardware monitor open to use it, which is a tad annoying. Also from what I've been reading, it seems like OHM hasn't been getting updated and thus won't support newer CPUs (not a problem now, but I am expecting to upgrade to a new cpu soon). I already have corsair's iCUE running on my computer which has temp tracking, and I can set iCUE to save sensor info in a document; so my new idea is to just have iCUE save the temps in a document, and python read that document to get the temp. The only question is how much latency will that add to the temp-acquisition, tho I assume it shouldn't be too much.

I writing functional Python. What is the best approach to handling in an input dictionary and then outputting an ouput dictionary? In OO, the dictionary would be modified, but what do I do in pure/impure fp?
You'd think a *publishing company* should know where stuff should be or shouldn't be posted... there's a job board at the first link on the python reddit....
LOL
they are filthy capitalists
&gt; Are there any particular issues that come to mind? This one, as far as I'm concerned: https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/issues/2114 I've intensively looking around it for the best part of today, couldn't find a solution in plotly.py.
I write all my code twice: a functional version for me, and a pretty version for the person I show it to who wants to use it.
Alright buckle to fuck up as I attempt to comprehensively explain two hours of trial and error that I don't fully understand to you. 1. Firstly, you're going to need to register an application with Spotify. This can be done at this link: [https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard) 2. Install Spotipy, ideally NOT through pip. If you do install through pip, manually copy and paste the required code from here: [https://github.com/plamere/spotipy/blob/master/spotipy/client.py](https://github.com/plamere/spotipy/blob/master/spotipy/client.py) into the '[Client.py](https://Client.py)' file in the module. The module can be found in the Site-Packages folder. 3. take the Client ID and Client Secret keys you see once you've created this application, and paste them into the SPOTIPY\_CLIENT\_ID and SPOTIPY\_CLIENT\_SECRET variables. Also make your username to the 'Username' variable 4. On the Spotify for developers site, click "edit settings" then past [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) into the **Redirect URIs** 5. Now Spotify needs to verify your client credentials. In order to to this, you need a server that it can route to (don't ask me why). Run the code here: [https://github.com/PappaStalin/BasicHttpServer](https://github.com/PappaStalin/BasicHttpServer), it creates a basic HTTP server that runs on the port 8080, which is what the port we want the service to reroute to. 6. run the python file from terminal. If this is successful, it should open a new tab in your default webbrowser with the spotify login page. Log in, and the page should reroute to another page on localhoost:8080 that says 'Rerouted' (if you used my HTTP server code). Copy and paste the url from the page that says 'rerouted' into terminal. I know that this process is about as fun as trying to remove food from a moving blender, but the end result is cool. Just give it a shot and I'll try to help with any issues. For any bugs, check the Spotipy documentation: [https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/](https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) &amp;#x200B;
Ha the rate limit issue been patched with Jupyter notebook in the newest version of plotly, or this express version?
Give us a minor feature and we ask for the world :-). What you’ve done is awesome!
Nice, I have also seen a script that does similar but then queries the Genius API. If only Spotify had lyrics available it would be much more compact
Did you professor call it a definite loop or a finite loop? It's really easy to accidentally make a `while` loop execute forever. It's more difficult with a `for` loop. If you use something like ``` for i in range(1500): foo(i) ``` it's very obvious what you mean and you know _exactly_ how many times `foo` will be executed. With something like ``` count = 0 i = 0 while count &lt; 1500: count += bar(i) ``` on the other hand, you cannot know how many times `bar` will execute because that depends on the returned values. 
Man that's cool. Definitely something I can learn from .

whats import turtle? eli5 new to python :)
&gt; This appears to suggest that the compiler will in fact reuse the original pointer? It doesn't appear to suggest any such thing and furthermore looking at the C code of those routines they unconditionally do an extra copy to a properly aligned variable, then create a python object that owns its own copy. For example: static PyObject * nu_long(const char *p, const formatdef *f) { long x; memcpy((char *)&amp;x, p, sizeof x); return PyLong_FromLong(x); } `PyLong_FromLong(x)` definitely creates a new object that owns its own representation. It can't possibly own a reference to the underlying buffer because it's constructed from a local variable. 
Seriously I was also confused by that... and why minestrone instead of a chowder or maybe a nice bisque?
Hey man, this is really cool. I made a fork of your code and rejigged it to use a simpler OAuth token -- this removes the need for HTTP server/callbacks, and in fact doesn't rely on spotipy at all as everything goes via their HTTP api. check it out [https://github.com/richstokes/Spotify-Lyrics](https://github.com/richstokes/Spotify-Lyrics)

&gt;I write all my code twice: a functional version for me, and a pretty version **with annotations and docstrings** for the person I show it to who wants to use it. 
Thanks! This is really my first time using an API, so I probably didn't do it the best way I could've. I'd really like to make you a Collaborator, so you can make my API connection code less of a mess. 
I sent you a collab request through github, if you want to implement some of your changes
Do you think it'd be worth using an ORM tool like SQLAlchemy to interact with the db? It looks like sqlite on its own has explicitly state SQL statements, which I'm not sure is ideal to use (SQL injection attacks wouldn't be a concern as it's just a small internal tool, but I'd still like to do things the right or most efficient way)
Thanks, mines just doing a HTTP call to their API, you can get an example that you can run via your console (curl) on the same page you get the OAuth Token: https://developer.spotify.com/console/get-users-currently-playing-track/?market= Then just parsing the output via pythons JSON handlers. The nice thing is it removes the complicated setup process. I'll keep working on my fork as I might add some other random stuff - not sure yet. 
Are you okay with me coping some of your code into my respiratory? I'll give you credit in the doc, and it'll look MUCH better and be more accessible. 
I haven't decided if I love you or hate you. Solid variable name regardless though lmao
Of course, feel free to take/merge in any of it :)
Yeah. There is some source code provided in that Stack Overflow thread, which may help. At the very least it gives you an idea of all of the hoops you have to jump through to get WMI to bend to your will. Good luck!
&gt; What's the use case for specifying Firefox in the headers? Occasionally it's to get around sites that don't want you to do stuff like this.
I use APScheduler at work for a similar sounding flow. Just lately revisiting my jobs queue (something of a misnomer more of a jobs collection) and implementing asyncio support, which is somewhat primitive in the current version of APScheduler. Should future proof well though as version 4 will have full asyncio support. Anyhow, it's worth looking at even if your scheduler need isn't great.
It looks like the OAuth token my expire after an hour, I'll see if they do a longer-lasting one / why it expires so quickly
&gt; Normally both the intermediate variable and the memcpy call will be skipped by C optimisation in little-endian architectures (gcc &gt;= 2.91 does this). The note saying that memcpy() is skipped by C optimization in little-endian architectures, combined with the fact that most PCs are little-endian, would lead one to assume memcpy() is not called most of the time. I see why they thought that, but you're right that shared ownership of memory can be quite limiting, that they may be concerned with the wrong thing. Then again, maybe they're processing insane amounts of data.
This looks awesome! Glad it's out. Couple of questions about the animation: is it possible to call a python function on say a slider change which transforms data and returns it? Also, can you recommend the easiest way to share a plotly powered jupyter notebook so all the visuals work?

That would be great, I'm a beginner when it comes to web API's, and I really have no idea what the hell I'm doing. I pushed your changes to the Github page, but I still have a version of the original saved locally if we can't find a way to get a permeant OAuth token. 
I started learning Python about a month ago, although I more or less picked it up, worked on other stuff, and then decided "I want to do this project" about a week ago. It helps that I have general experience with programming (Java, C, C#), and the fact that Python is a lot more readable in general (in my opinion). Honestly, I'd say whatever you want to work with, look for a youtube video on it. Obviously not everything will have a nice tutorial online, but a lot of the bigger libraries (PyQt and the discord library come to mind) have video tutorials. Something like Scryfall you just kinda have to rely on the docs, which is fine, but if you're like me learning from a video is a million times easier. How much Python have you learned so far? I don't really know where to go with tips, but what is it you're having a problem with? Is it the programming itself, or more coming up with ideas on what to make with Python? I could try to give some tips, but I'm not really sure what you need help with, y'know?

It doesn't have anything to do with endianness really. The problem was that on some architectures unaligned reads flat out result in a hardware exception. So if you have a network packet and you want to read a 4 byte integer at address packet_start + offset, you can't do that, you have to memcpy it to a variable that's guaranteed to have 00 as two Least Significant Bits of its address before you can use it. What they are saying is that they hope (and supposedly tested on GCC&gt;2.91) that the copy to a properly aligned local variable is elided and `PyLong_FromLong(x)` gets fed the original value on all architectures that don't require alignment. This detail only adds colour to the correct answer to the OP's question: no, struct.unpack for primitive types copies underlying representation instead of sharing it with the original buffer. I wonder if there are any types that do, though.
Yeah, I'll have another look tomorrow. I found this in the Spotify docs - [https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization-guide/#authorizaton-code-flow](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization-guide/#authorizaton-code-flow) &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; Looks like the process is (annoyingly) much more complicated to get a long-lasting token. I think we need to follow the "Refreshable user authorization: [**Authorization Code**](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization-guide/#authorization-code-flow)**"** option, but not entirely sure. 
&gt; But also, with types like that, why are you even concerned about where some 8 bytes are located? Mostly just curiosity. I’ve been looking at writing some stuff to work with binary files and I’ve been bitten in the past with writing code with a lot more memory copies than were necessary when working with very large files so it was on my mind. The most straightforward approach is of course the best one: unpack from a buffered reader instead of loading the entire file and then unpacking. 
&gt;&gt; But also, with types like that, why are you even concerned about where some 8 bytes are located? &gt; Mostly just curiosity. My point is that having a somewhat native Python integer that owns the 8 bytes is all around better than having a proxy that owns an 8 byte pointer to an 8 byte integer in the buffer. &gt; The most straightforward approach is of course the best one: unpack from a buffered reader instead of loading the entire file and then unpacking. Yep, yep. You can also use numpy if you're concerned about such stuff, it allows you to make arrays of c-like structs IIRC.
a few things looking at your repo, 1. unless I'm missing something, calling the api every 0.01 seconds is probably pretty bad, expensive if the api is priced per call or greedy / mean if the api is free to use 2. try to stay away from the use of global variables 3. I think response.json() returns a json object so you don't need to json.loads the response.text pretty cool project
This reminds me that I was in the middle of writing a script to make a Spotify playlist based on the past week of /r/music. Of course that already exists multiple times: * https://open.spotify.com/playlist/786oug1YGwr8Dg7jd2WvN5 * https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1T1apfJp0vJIK8sshbXm0X
Thanks. I didn't really expect this this project to explode, so I've spent the last couple of hours desperately trying to fix and optimize the code I wrote at 12 o'clock last night. 
Thank you so much for the detailed response! I will definitely try adjusting permissions on the python script. Hopefully this will fix it considering everything works when it is ran on the server side. I'm actually running the PHP and python on an IIS server, not using Apache if that makes a difference. Also I should've mentioned that I have been getting python scripts to work through the browser if I run one which simply outputs text. The physical printing is just not happening.
Create custom assets or pray they have a ttk theme that isn't "glossy means modern"
I tried ttk but it lacks the modern looks im wanting, i'm asking if there is a way to achieve a modern design and a clean aesthetic with tkinter
That's basically what I was doing before. I ran a HTTP server locally which I told the Spotify API to reroute to. I could then log into Spotify and send the URL that was returned to Spotify for verification to receive a permeant token. It was a pain in the ass to run, though. 
Bad luck for me then, guess i'm going to make my own repo with a tkinter theme then. Wish me luck.
Yeah, might be able to run something like bottle to run the server locally. I was hoping to be able to do it all via console/command line and not have to do anything in the users browser, but looks like that's just how they do things.

It was part of the original Logo programming language developed by Wally Feurzig and Seymour Papert in 1966. Heres the [page](https://docs.python.org/2/library/turtle.html) for it.
This is probably more suited r/learnpython. In addition, if you want help, it would be good to provide specific details (your code, its output, expected output, etc).
I see, thanks for the info. I've been tinkering with Python for about 3 years now, but I can't really do much. I don't have much of a programming background, other than having dabbled with HTML, CSS, and Excel VBA. I can import a few modules like random, webbrowser, requests, numpy, pandas, and do some entry-level tasks, but I don't feel like I have much of a direction with my learning. I've watching a bunch of YouTube videos like you've mentioned, it's just that I don't know what to do next. I like the idea of web scraping, but I don't know of any projects that I could take on. I like sports (NBA and UFC), so I'm sure I could do something with some sort of statistical program, but I've yet to try it.
You wont be able to beat the speed of a non-toy matrix multiplication in numpy with anything you write yourself in C, short of calling openblas yourself, period. Correctly written, vectorized numpy code will be faster than C. Its pretty much an easy API to a BLAS lib.
Plotly Express doesn't do this out of the box but today you can use the `.update()` mechanism to add traces to a secondary Y axis. We're working on Plotly Express features to compose multiple figures together, which is how I think I'd like to address this multi-Y-axis question.
That is an interesting one, and would be very nice for Plotly Express, given how easy it is to create matched subplots :)
I believe that you can set the angular range with `layout.polar*.sector` although I don't love where that attribute ended up in the figure schema and what it's called. https://plot.ly/python/reference/#layout-polar-sector Re Dash routing I know the Dash team has been busy working hard on all sorts of issues, so perhaps they've been solved by now!
Working on an automation tool that interfaces with the RIPE NCC measurement API to create and enrich traceroute data based on user supplied filters. It's very useful so far. I work on network perfomance and optimization almost daily so an addition tool always helps.
There is nothing in Plotly Express that would raise any rate-limit issues... If you've seen rate-limit issues in Jupyter with Plotly.py I suspect you were using it in "online" mode which causes it to make requests to our Chart Studio Cloud service, which does enforce rate limits. You could try using "offline" mode as documented here: https://plot.ly/python/getting-started/#initialization-for-offline-plotting If the thing you were trying to do was save static files, we have open-sourced the Chart Studio Cloud software that does this, and you can find more info here: https://medium.com/@plotlygraphs/plotly-py-end-of-summer-updates-5422c98b9058
&gt; is it possible to call a python function on say a slider change which transforms data and returns it? This isn't possible from a notebook, no, but you could do it in Dash! &gt; can you recommend the easiest way to share a plotly powered jupyter notebook so all the visuals work? Yep, you can use nbviewer with Plotly Express or plotly.offline.iplot (which is what Plotly Express uses) and you can see this working here for example: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/plotly/plotly_express/blob/master/walkthrough.ipynb *shameless plug* You could also save your notebooks to our Chart Studio Cloud service, which natively supports Plotly figures of course, and if you sign up for a paid plan lets you keep your files private and control who you share them with.
You can't. A quick Google search brought up [this](https://stackoverflow.com/a/477513/888633) answer. Also, this should be asked on /r/learnpython just for future reference 
thank you so much :-)
I feel this is relevant, https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_number
okay, i'll post it there thank you
Another question : this GPA that is required refers to highschool or the university's grades?
Are you asking about line 5 of the grouper recipe? That's a fair question: even though `args` is defined on line 4, here we're using a star operator to pass the *contents* of `args` rather than the literal object `args` (yo dawg... I heard you liked iterators... so I brought you an iterator that iterates over a collection of `n` iterators... jk, this is an intermediate/advanced-level topic, for now I would just think of the star as a clue that we're preparing to do something to all of the elements _inside_ `args` while leaving the actual container object, `args`, unchanged) Maybe an example would help: &gt;&gt;&gt; def fstar(*args): 2 print (type(args)) 3 for i in args: 4 print(i) &gt;&gt;&gt; def f(args): 2 print (type(args)) 3 for i in args: 4 print(i) &gt;&gt;&gt; f([1,2,3,4,5,6]) &lt;class 'list'&gt; 1 2 3 4 5 6 &gt;&gt;&gt; fstar([1,2,3,4,5,6]) &lt;class 'tuple'&gt; [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] &gt;&gt;&gt; fstar(1,2,3,4,5,6) &lt;class 'tuple'&gt; 1 2 3 4 5 6 &gt;&gt;&gt; f(1,2,3,4,5,6) Traceback (most recent call last): File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt; TypeError: f() takes 1 positional argument but 6 were given f() takes 1 positional argument but 6 were given Oh, by the way: if you were curious where `zip_longest` came from, you'd be right to wonder! It's a function that's part of Python's standard library, but I forgot to import it. The missing invocation is: `from itertools import zip_longest` 
We are trying to get an ansible pipeline built to automatically deploy database.
That's cool. Just putting this here in case anyone actually is interested in using something like this, there is an app called Musixmatch that has shows synched lyrics based on what you're listening to in Spotify or Youtube.

Based on what you're describing it sounds like a better fit for something like [APScheduler](https://apscheduler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). It works great with Python 3 and lets you leverage asyncio. You can even eschew a backend completely and have track/store jobs in-memory if your ETL flow can tolerate it. I feel like in the age of cloud-managed message buses and queues, some of celery's novelty is lost. I've worked on two projects that have relied on celery and in one it feels like total overkill and over-complicated the project, and the other it feels constraining. 
I was just going to comment that!

OK, if you check my fork now - I found a way to do this with https://pypi.org/project/spotify-token/ Much simpler and will probably be more user friendly. Next thing to do is re-run the `get_token` function every 30 mins so that we always have a good token.
Just threw in a quick hack to get a new token if the api fails to respond, that should at least let the script run forever without major errors :) 
One additional nit - rather than go after google.com, trying 1.1.1.1 or 8.8.8.8. Save DNS queries.
Mind if I clean it up a bit?
Just put in a simple program that prompts the user for a username and password, then caches them to a text file. This is probably a bad programming practice, but hey, it works.
Sure I'll try that.... Thanks for your suggestion.
I will apply that in the application and try dude 😁
Thats cool! It's no less secure than my way of leaving the credentials in an environment variable really. Figured its a music service so not too worried. Always a trade off between security and convenience. I'll take these methods as it can be ran 100% in the console now, no need to run a web server and all that other messing about. Great stuff :) 
PyQt5 is what you are looking for But read licensing before publishing anything 
I know it probably isn't what you want to hear, but if you are looking for a framework that works like html css and js together, why not just go with electronjs?
Also, calling an API that many times can get you flagged and blocked by them as a potential spammer/hacker/nefarious-user. You, testing your program: Your shit is working and then suddenly it's not and you'll spend hours trying to debug the problem only to find it's them cutting you off. It's always good to keep outside calls as infrequent as possible while still keeping the application acceptably functional. Sweet program and great idea, just trying to pass on some hard-learned truths.
Thank you. I've heard it but couldn't experience. I will update this when I do.
Just as shitty as seaborn
For multi-stage docker builds, why wouldn't you build wheels in the first stage, copy those over &amp; install them?
that's so cool! I just checked your code and it doesn't seem immensely complex. I'm a beginner in coding and I learned the fundamentals of python along with other things like pandas and numpy. how much time would you say do I need to make something like that? I would really appreciate if you answered 
You. I like you. ❤️
When in doubt, Darude - Sandstorm. 
Cool project. I made a [fork](https://github.com/dangsonbk/Spotify-Lyrics) of your code and use [Genius.com](https://Genius.com) as lyric source instead of google.
This required some web scraping, HTTP header synthesis, JSON parsing, and API interaction, some of which I knew and some of which I didn't. If you want to make something similar, I would check out the Spotify API (https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/) and basic web scraping (https://www.dataquest.io/blog/web-scraping-tutorial-python/). If you need too, you can use my code as a reference. Good Luck!

If you don't need persistence, you don't really need any separate tasking library. Python's async support is really good now. Just spin up a bunch of asyncio tasks and go to town. If you need a full-up ETL system, you might take a look at Airflow and Luigi. They have big names behind them, Airbnb and Spotify respectively.

This entire thread is the reason I love reddit. Best of luck on your collaboration guys sounds like you make a good team! :)
Forgive the noob comment: what's the adavantage of all this versus using panadas built in plotting methods? I usually start with those, and if needed use them to create a plot object and manipulate that with plotly methods.
There is nothing else using the "system" python packages in the docker image. I'm really not convinced that this is necessary or a good idea outside extremely niche situations.
Hi. It is Autodesk Maya 2019
Hey, I read that paper. I saw post (probably yours) on reddit also :)
Hey, plants overall don't look that bad in Jurassic Evolution :) 
Thanks for the reply! Trying it out now. I did notice one thing: if I put %matplotlib inline to also use mpl plots (cause legacy stuff) then the px stops rendering - it makes a blank space in the notebook of about the size the figure would be. I figure generally px replaces mpl altogether but it would be nice if they could work together in the same notebook.
Oh awesome! Yeah, I posted about the project on the sub a while back. I'm not Charlie, so I can't speak much for the paper aside from saying it's a good read!
someone else in finance here - one of the larger firms. And while things certainly used to be very conservative thats changing. Python 3.7 is being heavily used for new projects along the latest versions of various ML and data science libraries. Quite open now to trying new tech - if teams have the bandwidth to do POCs etc. Pushing that tech out to production is a whole other process - but even so - must less onerous that it used to be.
Can anyone tell me how to run this script on my laptop I'm a beginner in python, really interested on how to run this script 
see [https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/3pzf1f/teaching\_python\_to\_middle\_school\_students\_advice/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/3pzf1f/teaching_python_to_middle_school_students_advice/) especially the last comment ;-) 
Thank You. Your app looks really amazing! Good luck with future development. I hope I will see Your new renders or demos soon :)
Thank you very much :)
Thank you!
in terminal, type "git clone https://github.com/PappaStalin/Spotify-Lyrics.git" and then type "python Spotify-Lyrics". In order to run it, you'll need the python requests library, BS4, and spotify_token, all of which can be installed via pip
You beat me to it as I just came from your README to tell him. Might wanna add the rest of those to it though as all it states are the spotify one &gt;This program requires the spotify-token module which can be installed with 'pip install spotify-token'. Aside from that, it can be cloned and run without any alterations. Really cool project though. 
Isn't url shortener a beginner project? There is a course on YouTube and Udemy about URL shortening. 
This is the version I will use. Nice improvements. 
Read the docs Op

Sometimes you can't quite express things in terms of matrix operations though. I recently wanted to numerically integrate a several tabled functions over 1000^3 volume elements. All the numpy/scipy solutions involved keeping all 1000^3 points in memory simultaneously! However it was utterly trivial in Fortran to just write the triple loop and throw some OpenMP on there for parallelisation
You answered your question. If you’re getting fancy and using memoryview, my guess is you have a lot of data to read. In that case, struct is horribly inefficient and it also doesn’t give you control over whether your float/double data should be cast to floats or doubles. Numpy’s from buffer is ~1000x faster for a large array.
Yes. Even if you wont use all its powers it has great benefit also for scripting only. Also formatting help, autocompletion, proper syntax highlight, run condigurations and a debugger
PySide 2 is basically the same as PyQt5, except the license is more lax. You can also use the qtpy module to support both with nearly the same API.
Yes. And the free CE edition is great, very capable. So if it runs OK on OP:s environment, I don't see a reason for NOT using it.
By functional do you "working" or functional programming? At work I only write in functional programming.
Why are people downvoting me? I dont understand.
Its in the frakking command line!
For small projects you might like VS Code. It's more lightweight than PyCharm and its Python support is quite brilliant. Have a look here: [https://realpython.com/python-development-visual-studio-code/](https://realpython.com/python-development-visual-studio-code/])
Docker image is build for application that you going to run in it. If you have conflicts with system packages then this mean that you have "garbage" in your docker image. And for multistage builds, if your dependency is not just pure python files, use wheels, copy them to second stage and install them and remove wheels.
Minestrone is a quality soup that's why 
how doyou write simple scripts? It always tries to make a env and looks so heavy, lots of files, etc, takes a long time
Yes it's fine - you will have to configure your python interpreter (you can skip the part about defining venvs etc and just configure it for your python install) and you will get the advantages of the best Python IDE out there.
You can open a python script without creating a new project in PyCharm at the cost of not having some of the features pycharm does for you. If you are looking at a more lightweight option check out the comment from /u/rodka18
Which lyrics appear when listening to Darude - Sandstorm?
I don't think it's necessary, I use sublime + kite(an ai for auto-complete, documentation etc., it's free) 
When you start PyCharm, the only option is "Create New Project", doesn't look like there's a way around it?

For me there's also the "Open" button where you can open a project or a single file. Yes this way you'll have to create (at least the first) file from your file manager / explorer.
It's English. I don't know what 'google' you are using. [https://www.dictionary.com/browse/divulgation](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/divulgation) [https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/divulgation](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/divulgation) [https://www.thefreedictionary.com/divulgator](https://www.thefreedictionary.com/divulgator) [https://www.dictionary.com/browse/divulgate](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/divulgate) [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/divulgation](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/divulgation)
When creating a new project you can choose to create a new environment or use an existing environment. I almost always use an existing (conda) environment. Creating a new project takes no time at all and only adds 5 small files (&lt;2kB) to the project directory.
Yes, noone mentioned the cutdown version of pycharm: community edition (free). It's lean, simple and give you a taste of pycharm without having to go all in.

Genius. 
I don’t think so. Maybe give Kivy a look? https://kivy.org/
pycharm is shit. vscode = G.O.A.T.
&gt; [Nick Monroe on the issue](https://twitter.com/nickmon1112/status/1043130433603596288) Reading through this is just totally confusing. I don't know how it is acceptable that someone brings sexuality and race into question in a place where all this is (supposed to be) abstracted by a username in favour of quality of software. There are certainly instances, in institutions, where this conversation has meaning but certainly not in a place where we are all contributing with nothing else than our skills, in a system that is designed for that. People coming here saying "if you don't accept this pull request you are racist/sexist/whatever-ist" are themselves bringing attention to sex, gender, race, political views and what isn't in their agenda. Abstraction of identity is the pinnacle of inclusivity. If one wants to make its name, race, age, sexuality known it's up to them but if one uses any of these characteristics to say "you must accept my request because I am [feature here]", it's a never ending rabbit hole where everyone can come here and say "I am xyz therefore you must put xyz-ness before my skills and include me in [ijk]". **This is self-discrimination with the sole goal of gaining at the expenses of who's working hard without giving a flying penguin about sex/race/political views of who's contributing or maintaining/moderating.**
I think so. Anything more than a few lines I develop in pycharm. But then again, I always have it open so it's no overhead. If you're not using pycharm regularly, than many of the benefits won't be obvious since the config and power isn't as obvious till later in life.
You can check out the code at https://github.com/thevarunsharma/Animoji-Animate
Nice job
Knees weak arms spaghetti
Puré genius.
&lt;class 'dict'&gt; should not be in your script. It's the output of: type(eng2sp) Remove it.
This is very nice .. gonna use it tonight. I wish Spotify app had this option built-in to read lyrics. Their "Genius/Behind the lyrics" integration with part of the lyrics and history of a song is useless and rather annoying at times.
Thank you, not sure why the book included that line. Its the same with the line: {'three':'tres','one':'uno','two':'dos'} This is what gets printed but the book doesn't make this clear
It's pretty clear, actually: it shows the code being executed line by line in an interactive interpreter session. The stuff prefixed by `&gt;&gt;&gt;` is what the user inputs, and everything without any prefix is Python's output. You can launch the interactive interpreter by running `python`, `python3` or `py` in the terminal. 
Well done.
From the looks of it, the book expects you to type it in interactive Python. If you type python in the terminal, you will be greeted by the '&gt;&gt;&gt;' and you'll be able to follow along. 
Dope!!! &amp;#x200B;
Ah - so the facial recognition is all in the dlib library?
r/mildlyterrifying
Yeah, it has the face detector

Yeah it was confusing because they only started presenting it in this way 60 pages into the 131 page book. That said if I knew about the interactive interpreter I'm sure I would have worked it out (not sure if the book mentioned it or not, would have thought so, so I'll chalk that up as I must have missed it). Thanks for telling me how to activate it in terminal, it does now indeed reflect what is in the book!
Ah that is good to know, thanks!
I like PyCharm (and IntelliJ for that matter), and use it nearly every day. Even at home, I use it when writing even basic scripts. That being said, I would hesitate to point a novice at it, since it can be daunting to set up. 
Woah nice
If it's a hairy-looking project not very well specified, I think you are better off making it as simple as possible, so it's also simple to change when suddenly they want something new added to it. Is there some compelling reason you need to go async at all? Regardless of the tech, this will add complexity. There are simpler ways to handle scheduling and retries.
Did you try OpenCV at all? If so, how does performance compare? I’m working on a related project and might try dlib. 
WHAT 
Some books forget to clarify some standard convention in writing code examples. In this situation, when you start a python shell the input line will have &gt;&gt;&gt; At the beginning, so in the examples, they will have that to demonstrate where you should type. But you shouldn’t type that The same goes for shell commands where you would see something like this $ pip install flask It means write pip install flask at the shell terminal, not the python terminal. Usually the book will also have some other convention to show you where to substitute a certain word for your specific thing 
what is the performance of the face detector? is it made based on only your facial landmark features?
Inb4 you’re hired at Google
Yes, it first detects the face and then detects the position of 68 facial landmarks in that face
and what hardware are you running this on?
Core i3 CPU with Intel HD Graphics
One such feature that you lose is the ability to import anything at all, even if you've got the modules installed to your default Python directory. This is the main reason I switched to just writing my scripts in IDLE, whilst I loved how powerful PyCharm was, it just didn't seem designed to take advantage of Python's scripting abilities.
That’s really nice ! I’m definitely trying this soon. 
Yeah, I have used OpenCV's haar cascade face detector, turns out that Dlib face detector is faster but accuracy is more or less the same.
One could even say a beautiful soup.
Do you know - is there anything similar for recognizing other things - such as hands for when a person is signing (sign language)?
That is sick. Very cool.
Is this the de_dust? 
One can use the open source haar cascades available to detect hands and then apply deep learning-CNN based classification to classify the gestures of the extracted hands
Thanks! I’ll implement dlib and see how it performs. 
hi, I'm new and no experience in coding too. can you give the link to your tutorial? thanks in advance.
sounds interesting im doing a few courses on edx and i hope to be doing things like this soon! stay positive and you got it!
That's a bug: there's nothing in px that should interfere with %matplotlib inline (or vice versa) ... I'll take a look! Here's the issue I'll use to track this: https://github.com/plotly/plotly_express/issues/13
New to this world as i am working on modules : python basics for science data so any tips would be helpful haha 5 chapters to get through and chapter 1 was tough but i got 100% on the knowledge check so im doing something right ahaha
That's a great question! The biggest single advantage is interactivity, and specifically the ability to hover over the visualization to read off exact values or identify points. After that there's zooming, panning, the ability to show/hide traces from the legend etc. Having an interactive plot can save a ton of time over static plots. `pandas.plot()` returns (static) matplotlib objects, and we do already have the `cufflinks` library which adds a similar `pandas.iplot()` method to that one which returns plotly objects. So if you like the pandas.plot API, you're already covered :) I have personally found the pandas.plot() API to be a bit inconsistent and it forces me to reshape my data to make different kinds of plots, so the second big advantage of Plotly Express is that it accepts "tidy" data.
Great job! 
Actually, you'll probably also want to keep an eye on this: [https://github.com/encode/requests-async](https://github.com/encode/requests-async)
Very cool! Reminds me of that DS game "Dr. Kawashima's Brain Training" 
Find a project that interests you, and build it. Practice, practice, practice. 
Have you considered to give it a license?
Lmao beast
Umm...not yet, thanks for the suggestion though, will do it now
I graduated with a CS degree 4 years ago too. I am building a game called Santorini in python in my spare time. Just find something that interests you, find a library that will help you do that thing, and just start doing it. There are lots of documentation and tutorials on all sorts of things like GUIs (tkinter and others), face recognition, AI development, etc. Just work on a project to completion, then try and optimize it for speed, memory usage, code length, etc. I guarantee you will learn valuable skills in the process.

hi im not very good at python, can someone give me an explenation about how this works please?
does this only work on the same ip or does it work over distance?
He just stuck a bunch of libraries together. Anyone can do that 
I made a password storage system that generates random passwords (uppercase, lowercase, punctuation and numbers) saves the passwords and the website they theyre for in an external file and has an encryption system so that someone on the computer cant just open the file and see all your passwords. 
The way it jitters around gives me hand-drawn animation vibes. Really cool!
I had a look at the code, it's intimidating but the outcome is so awesome that I feel like I should try it. What does one need to learn before doing such projects? I know the basics of Python, data manipulation and other things. These image processing things seem like a high hill mountain!!

Some OpenCV and some graphics library like PyOpenGL(better use the glumpy wrapper); or just OpenCV would also work as it can also be used to render graphics

I uploaded the new version this morning. If you have suggestions tell me! I will now add sideboards and maybe a form to let users add decks (but I am mot sure about this). And of course US prices
Ok. Thank you! I will have to check this out. 
Been out for over a month: https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/ao5dml/flask_has_overtaken_django_according_to_the_2018/
Oh really? I just saw it. I will take it down then
Just a heads up: When you submit a link usually reddit will tell you the last time that exact link has been submitted and provide you a link to search for other posts. I'm not sure how it works in "new reddit" though. [Example](https://i.imgur.com/gBr4sgy.png). It makes it easier to avoid reposting. 
I'm on the new reddit and nothing popped up. I have already taken down the post. 
Yea I'm not bugging you to take the post down. Just wanted to point that out if you didn't already know.
I just didn't know and I took it down cos it's already been posted. 
This is pretty cool 🎸🎸🎸
A little tip with this: when creating the sentinel every time a function is called, don't use the `object()` constructor. I'm not sure how someone could claim it's easier to understand than a list but a list literal accomplishes the same thing (generates a brand new object each call) only 4-8x faster. I.e. `stop=[]` is 4-8x faster than `stop=object()`. The spread is depending on if `object` is still in builtins or has been imported into locals (loading builtins are ridiculously inefficient). It's also about 1.5-2x faster than an attribute lookup on a type or a global load. We're talking about a difference of 15-20ns per call vs 80-160 so this isn't exactly a microoptimization. I said list literal was second fastest; if using this in a closure, the fastest way becomes possible by storing a float in a free variable and then add creating a new local variable with `sentinel+0.0`. The new float object will have a new identity every call, since floats aren't interned in any way beyond constant folding in the code object's co_consts and adding two floats is somehow 2x faster than building a new empty list but I guess that's because list requires calloc. PyFloatObject does use a freelist but the api will never return a pre-existing float whenever PyFloat_New is called. you can test with `a=0.0; x, y = a+0.0, b+0.0; x is y`. I know people like to ignore performance considerations in python but in this particular case since I saw in this post them building a new object with the constructor, and since this pattern is often used in tight loops, I felt i owed it to the planet to mention it. I only read until I saw that line so if the article covered everything I just said, my apologies.
I've been working on setting up vim for development in general, and python in specific... it hinges on this in my .vimrc: `augroup templates` `autocmd BufNewFile *.* silent! execute '0r $HOME/.vim/templates/Template.'.expand("&lt;afile&gt;:e")` `" use [:VIM_EVAL:] ... [:END_EVAL:] for arbitrary vim commands` `autocmd BufNewFile * %substitute#\[:VIM_EVAL:\]\(.\{-\}\)\[:END_EVAL:\]#\=eval(submatch(1))#ge` `" Replace Tags` `autocmd BufNewFile * %s/%%FILENAME%%/\=expand('%:t:r')/g` `autocmd BufNewFile * %s/%%DATE%%/\=system("echo -n \`date +'%B %d, %Y'\`")/g` `autocmd BufNewFile * %s/%%NAME%%/\=system("echo -n $NAME")/g` `autocmd BufNewFile * %s/%%ORG%%/\=system("echo -n $ORG")/g` `autocmd BufNewFile * %s/%%EMAIL%%/\=system("echo -n $EMAIL")/g` `augroup END` So when I launch vim with a new \*.py file, it loads my Template.py into the editor. Here's template.py: `#!/usr/bin/env python3` `# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-` `""" %%FILENAME%% is a prototype skeleton.` `Provide Docstring info here.` `"""` `########################################################` `__author__ = "%%NAME%%"` `__copyright__ = "Copyright %%DATE%%, %%ORG%%"` `__credits__ = ["%%NAME%%"]` `__license__ = "INSERT LICENSE HERE" #"MIT" #"GPL"` `__version__ = "0.1"` `__maintainer__ = "%%NAME%%"` `__email__ = "%%EMAIL%%"` `__status__ = "Prototype" #"Development" #"Production"` `#Date Created: %%DATE%%` `########################################################` `#Logging` `import logging` `logging.basicConfig(` `level=logging.DEBUG, #INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL` `format = '%(levelname)s %(name)s@%(asctime)s\n\t%(message)s',` `handlers = [` `#logging.FileHandler('%%FILENAME%%.log', mode='a'),` `logging.StreamHandler()` `] )` `log = logging.getLogger('%%FILENAME%%')` &amp;#x200B; And it continues on with a bunch of things I commonly use commented out, a stub if \_\_name\_\_ == "\_\_main\_\_" function and some other things. I really think this is gonna level up my development by quickly scaffolding every new file I create. &amp;#x200B;
Make your own with `itertools` using islice and count. `[*islice(count(0.0, 1.0), 10)]` is the same as `[map(float, range(10)]` except you can use any non-integral float.
DLIB has also a CNN Face Detector, which is slower (probably not real time compatible) but should recognize faces from a wider variety of angles. I have been using Digikam a lot lately and as soon as the face is tilted in any direction it doesn't recognize the face anymore. It uses DLibs Haar Cascade as well. &amp;#x200B; [https://towardsdatascience.com/cnn-based-face-detector-from-dlib-c3696195e01c](https://towardsdatascience.com/cnn-based-face-detector-from-dlib-c3696195e01c)
Or Qt for the win. It has native appearance on each platform, but it supports themes, as well. It's very versatile but easy to use, and allows to do fancy and articulated things.

The amount they have functional looks interesting. Thanks.
You make a good point. Normally I would go with the simplest possible solution. Here, however, the problem domain involves exchanging data with an external partner, and I have every reason to believe it'll get bigger quickly, and then be extended to other partners. And the catch is that once it's done, management will assume it's a dead issue and expect instant results the next time they want to add to it. So in effect, yes, I am looking at overengineering, adding some complexity in the system with the goal of keeping the decoupled components simple. The other side of it is that we do not have any ESB or SOA tooling already lying around... I did manage to convince one manager that we should at least \*\*look\*\* at Mulesoft...
I've heard of these, but know little about them. I'll take a look. Thanks.
That's two votes for APScheduler. I note that it's also recommended by the author of Dramatiq, so I'll put this on the list of things to research. Thanks. &amp;#x200B;
Thanks. Just downloaded it and I think it's great.
Dude this is awesome. I don't know why didn't I try it and stick to tkinter and kivy but this is awesome. Like this is basically using django but simpler mark-up language in it. I love it. Thank you.
Welcome man 🙂 But do check the licencing thats the only issue with pyQt
I still use Spyder. It's fast and lightweight and provides just enough features while staying out of your way. 
&gt; could distribute a venv/virtualenv, but apparently there are a lot of dependencies aren't installed in the virtual environment. &gt; all I need is python with the standard lib and one maybe two third party libraries. So which is it? A virtual environment seems like exactly what you're looking for.
I was kind of thinking out loud. Yes I could just zip up a virtual environment, but this would be extracted onto a computer that doesn't have Python installed therefore it wouldn't work, at least as best as I understand it.
I will.
Seems you're right. I think WinPython is your best bet then. I've seen that they have a creator kit that you can use to customize the distribution
How does this compare to [Elephant](https://elephant.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)?
Code quality could be improved: * don't use ``global``! Try to use return values and pass parameters into functions where needed. * magic numbers all around. Example is the amount of tries of *10000* - should be put into a constant at module level. That way one could easily adopt the number * the naming is not expressive: ``vs`` as a name for a function is difficult to grasp. Of course your *overall* goal is the battle between two actors, but the modern expression "x vs y" doesn't fit here, as this function does only a part of the overall calculation. Better try to be more expressive in finding names that describe the functionality, like ``calculate_one_battle`` or similar. I only had a short look from my mobile, so I can't dig any deeper, like reasoning, whether recursion is a good approach here.

Yes. I love it. Handles virtual environments very well. 
Question - no college education here. How does one go through four years of comp sci without learning things like list comprehension? I mean I still definitely struggle with lists of dicts and things like this, but I’m self taught. 
I would use it as first choice. Sometimes it takes a while to open which can be frustrating if you want to make a quick edit. In that case I usually use vi or gedit... a lot of people don't know that Gedit is actually pretty good (if on \*nix. You can even embed a python interpreter in your editor. You just need to set the settings so that a tab (if you use tab) is equal to 4 spaces. You can even set auto-parenthesis too. 
Thanks for explaining. Yeah, university grades matter most.
Great usage. 
You should be able to open an existing one as well
It's more than nothing friend, you're on the right path and should feel proud.
That's not correct lol. You don't lose anything whatsoever. However you may need to set the correct Python interpreter... especially if using virtualenvs

I would say that would be pretty difficult. They will typically look like [this](https://github.com/rootVIII/tube_dream).
Replace outermost loop with mainloop and change break condition to an exit state.
That sounds like a job for expect, not python.

I hate to be That YAGNI Guy, I'm as guilty of overengineering as anyone, but I still don't get the need for an async queue. If you want composition of tasks why not pipe the output of one process into another? If you have multiple partners each with their own user-defined schedules, I can see a case for APScheduler, but that can just be used to kick off a subprocess - no need for async. If you are worried about too many jobs running concurrently on a single machine, I can see a case for introducing a queue. But I am by no means an expert, so maybe I'm missing something. I have had good experiences with Dramatiq for this kind of project. But it does add quite a lot of complexity, not least because then you are managing a RabbitMQ or Redis instance. You have to consider the installation and maintenance costs next to piping a few scripts together and kicking it off with cron.
Your formatting is all busted up my dude. When you print out your list are you your strong and your numbers will not be together. Are you trying to create a list like ['start:', 45] Also please post questions like this over in r/learnpython.
Besides /r/learnpython ... you, as the programmer wrote the condition of the first conditional. You **know** that `"y"` doesn't need to be `lower()`ed or `strip()`ed since you wrote it. It's not user input. It is also very unclear what you want to do. Are you intentionally recreating `num_list` each time? Is this even in a loop? This does work for me. import random #added userinp=input("would you like another number? y/n ").lower().strip() if userinp==("y").lower().strip(): num_list=['start:'] num=random.randint(1,90) print (num) num_list.append(num) print(num_list) # Added 
\*yawn\* I'll be interested when setting property #0 is supported. :-) I'm just kidding. Looks great!

Wow. Im new to python. Not trying to steal anything thats rjghtfully yours but if i were to copy and paste your code onto Pycharm thats installed in my mac would i be able to run it?? 
Just, like, use an RSS reader?
Thank you.
Can be any ip or dns host name. Server just needs to be running at that ip. You can simulate by using two networks at home. I use my pc with my internet. And my laptop connected via hotspot. Then find your servers ip and put that into the client code. Port forward the port on the router and go from there
Oh nice. Interesting. Thanks
I disagree. When I worked at Cloudflare, there was a 3rd party app that didn't do anything novel, but it was useful since we refused to provide any type of extensions for the customer dashboard (outside of partner integrations). It was just using the customer api, anyone could do it, in fact tons of customers have done it. We talked about recruiting that person a few times over the years. No idea how those conversations went, but something unspectacular that wasn't even related to a product we wanted to build was targeted for recruitment. If I'm a Google recruiter I probably have tons of jobs to fill across a multitude of internal orgs. Someone putting out a decently cool pet project that shows they have a basic understanding of stuff being done/leveraged internally is someone you want to reach out to. You basically skip one whole phase of the hiring process. In this case, you feel confident they'll make it deeper into interviews than pulling a random resume out of the stack.
Just clone/download the repo and run it using terminal. Make sure that you have the dependencies installed
Goos to know. And by the way great job. Best of luck.

That's part of the HTML spec. `class="badge alert-info"` is really `class=["badge", "alert-info"]`, HTML just doesn't have a real way of representing arrays. You can filter your results manually, or you can use a CSS selector.

Is infosec some particular site or does it just mean "information security"? I did a quick search for "infosec rss" and found https://www.jimwilbur.com/infosec-feed/ If you check out the requests being made on that page the feed data is populated from https://feed.informer.com/widgets/CUSX8SYJ6K.js I'm not sure if this is what you're looking for or not, but it returns HTML inside a javascript object and it wouldn't be too difficult to extract just the links. 
Its not on my main computer, so i'll try and do that as soon as possible
Explicitly mention python 2 or 3 if needed. Even better : package your script, with specifying the python version in setup conf. 
It depend if you mind the (relative) overhead. If you are angry about few seconds before the editor launch, use something lightweight. Otherwise, pycharm is fine.

You set both the maximum and the minimum to the same variable. that's what i think at least.

compare(value) needs something to return to. Put "maximum, minimum =" before it without the quotes.
The idea behind property is to avoid a problem you run into in some other languages. Let's take Java as an example. Suppose you write a Java class like: public class Person { public String name; } And later you realize what you actually want is to instantiate with a given name and family name, or with locale-dependent options for how the name should be formatted. Instead of a plain attribute `name`, you need a method. But in Java, if you make that change, you force every other reference to your class to change and re-compile. So in Java, people almost always recommend you start with getter/setter methods for *everything*, like this: public class Person { private String name; public String getName() { return name; } } This way, you don't run into the "well, what if I eventually have to change it to a method" problem, because it already is a method. In Python, though, you would just do: class Person: def __init__(self, name): self.name = name And if you later needed to turn `name` into something more complex that's computed by a method, you would do: class Person: def __init__(self, name): self._name = name @property def name(self): # do your complex logic here... The `property` decorator allows you to access `name` the same way you always did -- you don't need parentheses. Effectively, it hides the fact that you changed it from a simple attribute to a method. This *doesn't* mean that you should just write get/set methods and wrap them in properties from the start. It means you just start with plain attributes, and then *if* you get to a situation where one of them needs to become a method, you make it a method and put `@property` on it, which prevents the need for every other reference to change from `name` to `name()`.
You should post this is r/learnpython instead. &amp;#x200B; To answer the question though in python you don't need getters/setters. &amp;#x200B; class Person(object): def __init__(self, name, age): self.name = name self.age = age person = Person('Jake', 23) # get name print(person.name) # set name person.name = 'Andy' print(person.name) # same for age @property creates a read only property class Person(object): def __init__(self, name, age): self.name = name self.age = age @propery def older(self): return self.age + 50 person = Person('Jake', 23) print(person.older) # setting will throw an error # since the propery is read only person.older = 50 &amp;#x200B; A classmethod is a method that can be called without creating an instance of the class. In the above example `person` is an instance of `Person`. A common use case is sqlachemy; class Person(Base): id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True) name = Column(Text) age = Column(Numeric) def __init__(self, name, age): self.name = name self.age = age @classmethod def lookup(cls, name): return cls.query.filter_by(name=name).one_or_none() person = Person.lookup('Andy') &amp;#x200B; A staticmethod is a method that doesn't take self or cls as a parameter. class Person(object): def __init__(self, name, age): self.name = name self.age = age @staticmethod def adder(a,b) return a + b person = Person('James', 23) person.adder(2,3) &amp;#x200B;

Problem is when you have python2 standard on one release and python3 on another. So you have one *or* the other.
A lot of these aren't in the category you package.

I will take a look at it tomorrow at work. We have a flask-socketio backend that uses flask-graphql but without support for subscriptions. I've been looking for a way to add subscription support. I'll let you know how it goes.

Make a virtualenv, and it will have the name you want.
This looks outstanding. Hats off the the plotly team
No question, just want to say keep it up! I'm excited to try it out :)
Does this happen anywhere but Arch? Just curious.

I think the answer is a bit of both... `cufflinks` still exists and is maintained and we will continue to document/promote it at https://plot.ly/pandas/ On the other hand, we're putting a bit more of our own energy into Plotly Express at the moment, and our hopes is that it will encompass a superset of what `cufflinks` can do. There's lots of room for different plotting APIs in this world, and we want to give people the choice to use the one they are comfortable with :)
Thanks for the reply. I've also tried to use @property and a "Can't set attribute" error comes up. What does it mean and how do I resolve it?

If the platform is all the same. There is a way to compile your script to include the interpreter and it's imports to be standalone I believe?
Isn't this just counting in binary?
Super cool
That's a great point and one I've considered. That could probably lead me to a solution.
I enjoyed The Python Bible on Udemy. The instructor is energetic and thorough, and the course is very project based. It can often be purchased at about $15ish during the frequent sales, so if you decide to go for it wait for one of those. 
If you want to get fancy you could make a class that pretends to be a list of permutations, and converts the index into the correct list of 0's and 1's but never actually generates the whole list. &amp;#x200B;
Awesome. Thanks!!
Sometimes you need to get creative, like in your case, and for those times you can pass a custom function that takes a tag as an arg and returns true or false. [https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/#a-function](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/#a-function) m = """ &lt;span class="badge"&gt;13,094&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="badge alert-info"&gt;64.7%&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="badge"&gt;5,181&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="badge alert-info"&gt;25.6%&lt;/span&gt; """ from bs4 import BeautifulSoup, Tag def customfilter(tag:Tag): cls = tag.get('class') return ( tag.name == 'span' and cls is not None and 'badge' in cls and 'alert-info' not in cls) soup = BeautifulSoup(m, 'lxml') res = soup.find_all(customfilter) print(res) &amp;#x200B;
Wait, for me python is python3 and python2 is python2, is this related to the fact that I use 3.5+?
Create a spacer class.
Learn Python The Hard Way is a great quick course to get started. After you get the basics down, don't try to knock out a ton of other beginner classes. Pick a topic you're super interested in or think of a need you have that coding can help, then work on that idea. What you don't know, google, and you'll slowly find your way. If you're looking to get into trading, check out the Youtube playlist listed below (this guy is awesome). &amp;#x200B; Link: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BrpKpWwT2A&amp;list=PLQVvvaa0QuDcOdF96TBtRtuQksErCEBYZ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BrpKpWwT2A&amp;list=PLQVvvaa0QuDcOdF96TBtRtuQksErCEBYZ)
Thanks for the advice! This was just the comment I was looking for. I’ll look into that class and definitely let you know if I have any more questions along the way.
Thanks that’s awesome advice, I’ll look into it. I also appreciate that it’s ‘project based’, I think that will be really beneficial in teaching me some quick ways that I can actually use my knowledge.
What is your system python? It sounds like it might be python 2.
This is awesome, thanks for sharing mate
While it'd be nice to do so, it's not necessary at all, i.e. patents/ideas are different from implementation/copyright.
The problem is you also are using something else -- *not* pip -- which tries to import undocumented internal modules from inside pip. And a while back pip rearranged its internals, which means many older tools which did this will no longer work with a newer version of pip. If you type the exact error message you got into Google, you'll find discussions of it from back when it happened, with pointers on what to do.

This simple answer to your post’s title is _no_. And to your query if “Python” somehow chose a new default, that’s also _no_. Which version of the pip executable is references by the `pip` symlink is up to first your distro (in the default system pip install, if any) and then to you (in any manual install you later make). I don’t use Ubuntu, but a quick google implies that 18.04’s system install is Python 3, which would mean that if there’s also a system installed `pip` that will be a symlink to `pip3`. Now, _why_ is anything you’re running attempting to import form a module named **_internal**?
Please do. I was once in your position and so lost on how to get started. If I would have picked a project instead of trying to knock out every beginner course, I would be so much further in my journey. Good luck and try to code at least 60 minutes a day. Code, read other code, and/or read blogs about python/trading. 
Legacy code nobody pays to upgrade.

I suppose the remote computer needs to have python installed?
maybe you can try Atom
You give people who work for google too much credit
Sublime Text 3 with the Anaconda plugin (it's a plugin for Sublime specifically, unrelated to the anaconda distribution of Python). It gets you intelligent autocomplete, type hinting, linting, and some more functions that I haven't taken advantage of yet. Anaconda + mypy works very well for me. 
What's wrong with VSCode? Is it still slow for you? What hardware are you working on?
Hello For learning Python with regards to Data Science it is very important to to know what are the main topics which plays an important role in term of Data Science. Statistics and Mathematics concept are some of the important topic which is must in term of data science. But it is not necessary that we should have knowledge of Statistics for only learning Python. Python is a user friendly language and has easy syntax . The most important things to keep our mind before Learning Python is that we should Pursue the Course for Python or [Diploma in Python Course](http://pythonandmltrainingcourses.com/courses/best-diploma-in-python-course-in-delhi/) from the best Institute as it is the platform where we can build our skills and knowledge. We should know that teachers plays an important role in making the career of a student. 
I have 10 developers in my team and 9 use VSCode, slowness has never been mentioned and we only use the basic MacBook Pro model (2015-2017 models). If you want powerful lightweight, you can go with what my 10th guy uses, vim 
Any repo/git? 
Nah, they gotta be geniuses who have built entire libraries by themselves and write code at 200 words per second using nothing as reference coding continuously for 16 hours /s 
The same reason why people still use like Java 6-7-(if they are "lucky")8 while there is a new Java 12. Companies don't want to change, because they just want the profits, and upgrading old code is a long process.
Yep I thought about it.
Compared to brackets. 
Guessing you are not really using the power of the IDE in that case. Looking up functions, linting, etc 
Then try Sublime Text maybe? It's considered one of the fastest editors out there, even faster than Brackets. Failing that, there is always Vim, I guess. 
Check the given link in comment, there you found the github link..
&gt;you which comment ?
Have you tried to install it with the normal commandline? 
You need to sell the idea of the upgrade to your manager.

Looks awesome ! Bought the £10 one, can’t wait to see how it is, been wanting to get into machine learning hopefully this will be a good way :)
It is shipped with all major Linux distros and (too) many packages still are 2.7 only. While most major distros have some sort of Python 3 in their base repo this does not mean it is a current version. And this is the state for distros still with mainline support, not some obscure 10y old version with payed for extended support. 
You can try to reformulate your problem as optimization one, and use minimize(method='dogleg') to use the same algorithm.
What package is 2.7 only?
I think [this](https://github.com/subhamroy021/Hand-Gestures) is the one
Have a look at "pam" since I recently had fun with that. 
Nice bro! I will give a read to that code! 
good job with openCV!
In tkinter you have to trick it into playing gif's by loading each frame individually apparently. Theres a trick you can do to extract background color to make the image transparent. You can then slowly move the geometry of the image using after/update functions, like 'root.afterroot.after(1, root.geometry(f"+{x}+600"))' and 'root.update()'. I thought this would be cool to make notification overlays. I believe its possible to make image labels clickable as well but I haven't figured out how to implement it into what I have yet since i'm newer to python. If I can click on a gif that stays still, I could possibly make it do a different animation, open a context menu to do other actions, etc.
Not sure how this is specific to telcos or why it's in /r/python
Technical debt plus an actually quite difficult upgrade path. Individual companies I’ve worked for have investments in Python 2 code bases that runs into the tens of millions of lines of code. Across my industry it’s hundreds of millions of LoC... much of which is used to automate C++ programs made by others and on their own upgrade cycle that embed Python 2 interpreters. The investment in all that still-working Python 2 code is enormous and shifting it all to 3 isn’t anywhere near as simple as a copy and paste or “just use **futures**”... some of those C++ programs are themselves orphans and will _never_ embed 3. It’ll take a decade or more and a lot of attrition to get off 2 entirely. And any 3 code written will have to work in 2, so it’ll take even longer to adopt 3-only features that no backport exists for. For anyone not in such a company though there’s basically no reason for using 2 anymore. There are very few libraries that don’t support 3 these days, and the vast majority of that minority are abandonware, which means someone should pick up the baton and rewrite or replace them anyway.
The distros we need to support don't ship with a usable version of 3.x and enterprises won't upgrade to newer versions whislt the current one still has support. This means we have clients running RHEL that barely have 2.7.9 installed and they will only upgrade to RHEL 8 in like 5 years. 
This will be better answered in learnpython. Making insert statements is not that easy. You need to escape characters. I would suggest checking pandas read_csv and to_sql methods
If you want an IDE, try Spyder. It's not an Election app so it'll feel snappier than VS Code and it's geared for Python.

I used to use Atom. Switched to VS Code and can't possibly ever look back. 
Last release 2009. Alternatives: python-pam, which supports 2/3
I imagine a library such as Elephant is much more comprehensive than anything I have written. The only thing that may truly set my apart is functionality to carry out [graph theoretical analysis](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn2575), as well as a [data visualization tool](https://github.com/smu160/PvsNP/tree/master/gui). 
Great work.
That would be awesome! &gt; send you some bug reports I would appreciate that very much!!
But building your own software gives you the satisfaction...(btw i am not using vs code because of several reasons like 1. it is too much packed with features which i never use. 2. my laptop is old and it has only 4 gb ram in which if i run heavy applications it will hang a lot😅 3. i use sublime text because it have minimal UI and does have all the features that vs code have to offer which you can install if you need) Thanks for looking at my post tho😊
pip is both a Python package and a CLI (command line interface). To install packages, you need to use it as a CLI, in a terminal (cmd.exe on Windows). &amp;#x200B;
http://lmgtfy.com/?q=dependency+injection
I mean if it gives you satisfaction then by all means. My thing is why re-invent the wheel if the wheel is already great? Also, VS Code runs pretty fast. It's based on Electron which uses javascript to run. It's a lot faster than Atom which I used to use. So even with 4gb of ram, that should be plenty. Someone made a web based version of VS code and I got it to run on my android phone...So it's not as heavy as you think. And yeah it has a lot of features in it that I never use too, but they're not really in your face. You can close the file browser and it looks just as slim as other IDE's. I like VS Code because there's a lot of user created extensions that I like and use. I also like it visually. Functionally there's a ton of reasons I use it and couldn't give up. Also, VS code has an option in preferences to use sublime shortcut keys. Just fyi. Just trying to see if you'd reconsider. It's pretty nice :) 
Linked in the repo mentioned below, [this blog post about it](https://www.codeingschool.com/2019/01/real-time-hand-gesture-recognition-using-python.html). Not much more illustrative than reading the code, but had to be mentioned.

Because to everyone above me pushing new features is more important. I'm already happy we got to update everything to django 1.11

Nice! Love a bit of old school computer vision
SQLAlchemy is just the Django ORM ripped out of Django. Validation is built into Django too. Form data validation comes built in to Django and validation for other data like CSV, xml, or JSON comes with the popular Django Rest Framework.
What is your end goal? Are you actually trying to parse Python code? Or are you trying to get the type annotations from an already existing function?
I'm interested in the parameter names and the parameter types.
But is your input _actually_ text, or are you trying to get them from a function, and you just _think_ that getting them from text is easier?
Ah sorry for the confusion. No it is actually text.
Then look into the `ast` module.
can i just remove all the features that i just don't use?? in vs code??
This one is easy enough, isn't it? The next question would be how much work it is to replace the old module in existing code. And is it readily available for Python 3 in the distributions our customers use (Debian, Ubuntu, SUSE, RHEL)? (Telling them to just install it through pip obviously isn't an option.) &amp;#x200B; I'm glad that we (finally) are working on porting our codebase to Python 3 but there are some hurdles beyond our own code. PAM being one of the smaller one, if you want some largers have a look at duplicity and twisted. Both have limited functionality with Python 3, sometimes only as part of non-core developments. Twisted may be there now but I have become very cautios because the last time I checked a lot of modules simply weren't ported (just core things). Of course these things are all fixable but this needs people and time to work on which not every shop around has to the extend to be able to help port all of the libraries in use.
You can remove and hide pretty much anything you want. Like on the left panel, it shows a button for source control. You can right click and remove it.

Yeah, so 16.04 used Python 2, hence `pip2` was what you were calling if `pip` was invoked. A fresh install of 18.04 uses Python 3, so `pip3` instead, though I’m not sure If Python 2 is also installed. Thing is nothing should be importing from **pip._internal** that isn’t itself part of `pip2`, so I’m not sure what you’re doing to get that traceback.
I typically use scipy’s bfgs method.
Being? I can’t find an argument to use a version of numpy created in the last 5 years. The path of progress is such that the people that don’t upgrade run into a bug now and then that has been fixed, but can be coded around. It takes a big issue to force my boss to wrap his prints with parentheses. I still don’t know the killer feature in python 3. I’ve looked. Async is irrelevant to me. F-strings are just another way to format text. It’s a little faster and crashes harder when you have bytes as strings.
OpenCV uses machine learning for some stuff so maybe. I don’t know enough about OpenCV to say yes for sure though, although it seems likely in this situation.

Try `getattr(book, ask) == info`... note that this will throw an AttributeError if the user input value in **ask** isn’t actually a member of your book’s class.
`eval(f'book.{ask)')` should give you the attribute of the instance that you need. For example, `if ask=='title'`, it will return book.title.

&gt;eval(f'book.{ask)') Thanks, that did the job!
Thank you!
Ha! Awesome!
I wouldn’t call that behaviour unexpected. Here’s a [StackExchange question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/881696/unbuffered-stdout-in-python-as-in-python-u-from-within-the-program) from 10 years ago explaining one way to deal with buffered output in Python. It’s clearly new behaviour for you, but it’s not a bug and it’s not unexpected.
Whoa! **DO NOT** DO THAT!! Never, ever, _ever_ use **eval** on a strong you don’t control the contents of! The **getattr** approach is the correct way to do this.
That is the least secure way of doing this possible... **eval** should _never_ be used in place of **getattr**, **hasattr**, and **setattr**, and certainly not when the contents of **ask** are controlled by the user.
Don’t use eval. You’re opening the door wide for code execution vulnerabilities. You can use this: getattr(book, title, None) That won’t throw an exception if the attribute doesn’t exist. Just check if the result is None.
Yeh, I used the getattr xD Ty &lt;3
It does as the first step in running the program is “training” the computer to recognize the gestures.
Looks so good dude!
Thank you
Thank you
Thank you
\&gt; but my point is that the default behavior is not the expected one and therefore wrong! It's not just python, this is standard behavior of the C standard library (\`stdio.h\`) and most programs will behave exactly the same. Line-buffering is actually a special case and not the default. It is only enabled if the target file handle points to a tty device (e.g. a shell). If it's a regular file or pipe, the buffer will usually be about 4k and ignore line-breaks for obvious performance reasons. You can flush these buffers manually (\`sys.stdout.flush()\`) though. So, this is not a bug, but expected and documented behavior. Just remember it next time, and tell your friends. Buffering behavior should be common knowledge for any programmer and/or command-line user. &amp;#x200B;

thanks! yes, clearly I missed this. I'm still not convinced \`print()\` should behave different if not instructed to do so, but it is not a new thing. Do you know other applications that change buffer behavior after context? Seems most unix utils do not, but I might be mistaken about this as well.
Thanks! TIL! Just asked the question above.
Why are you being downvoted? Is it because Reddit thinks your English is bad?

I remember seeing a series of Facebook posts by a guy who made a gesture-detecting calculator a year or two ago. Basically this, plus more poses for calculation signs
Any program compiled against the C/C++ standard library (so really almost any program there is) will behave this way by default. Same is true for most linux/unix command-line tools. Pipes or file redirects are buffered by default.

Fun fact: A simple C program printing 1 million lines of `Hello, World!` redirected to `/dev/null` will run in 0.037s on my laptop. The exact same program with line-buffering enabled (via `stdbuf -oL`) requires 1.6s (43x) to run. Fun fact #2: Go (not C) defaults to unbuffered output, even when the target is a pipe or file. Go is as slow as line-buffered C in this case.
i have python2 and only made a call for pip2 and this error popped out to me. &amp;#x200B;
Could this potentially be used for things like translating sign language?
i didn't do this intentionally, i was installing something through pip2 and this error showed up ... after some research i found that such error maybe due a deprecation of pip2 so i thought to ask here if someone knows anything about that.

Currently, no. ASL/BSL, etc rely far too heavily on facial and other non manual markers, along with tone and speed dictating much of what is being said in Sign Language. You'd need multiple systems like this all running in concert, with thousands of hours of ML applied to begin really translating. 
Really appreciate it! Any questions or feedback message me either on the course forum or here :)

Why don’t you just put the books in a dict in the library with keys of their ISBNs? Then you can if book in library.items:

Well that’s weird, sounds like something’s gotten screwed up on your machine; for the record, they are completely able to co-exist (my own Arch machine has pip2 and pip3, with pip aliased to pip3, and I use them both constantly), but there’s an effectively infinite number of ways that you could screw up your system’s installation. I’d tend to suggest uninstalling pip2 and pip3 with `apt`, then reinstall them (first pip2, then pip3). It’s possible an upgrade went screwy somewhere along the way.

Getting an early archive for the python helper bot going. For now archive database will just be simple json instead of sqlite while I figure out what features I want to record, but eventually I'll shift to some sql like database to make updating easier. This will let me shift away from the bot responding to key phrases and start building more complex submission classifiers. I'm pushing the update to the pi today and then I'll probably spend a while putting out the fires the update causes. When that's done I'll officially be halfway to the alpha version of the bot and I'm excited about that. It's a huge milestone to me. All of the required reddit focused infrastructure will be mostly complete and I can start really focusing on the data science side of the bot from here on out.
I'd first kind of learn the basics of the area with Python (e.g. import pandas, play with dataframes in toy examples, etc), then I'd kind of learn some of the basics (if you haven't already) of ML for finance like ARIMA (and unless you want to try and improve/modify ARIMA/existing methods, libraryies would definitely be fine for this), then I'd start hitting free online courses like https://www.datacamp.com/courses/machine-learning-for-finance-in-python. I hope this helps, and I'd love to hear what you and the r/python community think of this list!
Interesting. No big deal, I didn't downvote, just an explanation

My coworker made a tool that helps us track/check our work last year in Python. We have a new project now and we the tool doesn't work with the current setup of our files and folders. I'm trying to fix it since we have to get it up and running by the end of the week. Issues I'm dealing with: Tons of hardcode Made use of environment variables in place of config files Uses Autoviv (nested dictionaries) in place of classes Has functions that are 500+ lines Used the \_main as a giant switch case that's about 3500 lines long. Since he spent "1 year working on this" he became very defensive when I suggested we just rewrite everything with a plan and standards going forward and due to the time constraint my manager just wants us to get it done and we can move forward with recreating the tool after our deadline. ... Feels nice to vent a bit
You would not believe how hard it is for legacy code to be given green light for a complete overhaul. Just taking current code and make it not fuck up with the unicode switch is a major undertaking. Tests? what tests? 
In the very first moment that I changed the names of my variables from spanish to english it decided to work on the first try. Something else had to be wrong, but this fixed it... Looking back at my code I'm 100% sure I just have one ESTACION and it was correctly written... Thank you for your help

1. Don't post pictures of code. 2. Especially don't post pictures of code taken on your phone. 3. /r/learnpython 4. Escape the backslashes in your path, or use a raw string.
Is it necessary to compare the previous state with the current state? ode solvers tend to use dynamic steps, so there is no guarantee of the time difference between steps and some steps might be evaluated but rejected. Think of how you can formulate your check for a single instant in time rather than comparing two different times. If you can, use `scipy.solve_ivp` and look at the events argument. Basically, you'll tell the integrator to stop when a certain condition is met. Then you can adjust the ode and state and restart the solution. At the end, you'll concatenate the state histories together to get the full history. This is exactly the same way I'd do it in matlab too, as it avoids integrating over discontinuities.
Throw an r before the path, or switch the backslashes to forward slashes.
Apologies and thank you for the help😊
Can u help me out with the 3rd line. I am not being able to import keys, showing error.
Yes i understood your joke. But the country your from is well known for scammers so it's kinda hard not to tell someone thats now what your doing.
In addition to what the other poster said, techniques like this are rarely robust enough in real world environments. This is a great project, but look at the video -- we've got a perfectly well lit room with a plain white background and very clear separated fingers. This is still a hard problem to solve, but very unlikely to work from a random angle video taken from a smartphone with who knows what in the background
No, but i think its a god beginner project, with documentation online ?
Computer vision is a type of machine learning
Why is an invalid request (400) appropriate here? Shouldn't this be a 404 not found? The request body format was validly formed, just contained data that wasn't found.

Have you (ever) used `sudo pip` to upgrade pip? That's usually the cause of this problem - you must never modify system installed packages except with the system packager. You may have done this without realising the potential problem - vanilla pip checks if an updated version exists and suggests you update it using `pip install --upgrade`, and unfortunately Ubuntu didn't modify this message when they packaged pip as a system package - so the system pip gives bad advice.
ha, I should have looked more closely, this is a client but we're looking for subscriptions on the server side.
Pretty nifty! I like your readme, very clear. Something that might help is a section on *why* someone would even want to do this.
Thanks a lot! Plenty to work with now
Ah...gotta give the full back story.
Good point, thanks for the feedback! I will add a section explaining why/how this could be useful.
Not quite---computer vision has been around before the resurgence of ML and has a rich history of interesting work related to image processing and geometry. Typically the non-ML stuff is called "classical computer vision" and the geometric stuff is called "multiple view geometry." Nowadays a lot of computer vision is powered by ML for tasks like recognition, classification, tracking, detection, pose estimation, and so on. But a lot of work still happens in classical CV as well, like SLAM, which is how a robot (or drone or self driving car) maps the space it's in and knows it's location in it.
You also probably need the inspect module. 
It sounds like you’re a lot more knowledgeable about ML and CV than me, but my understanding of machine learning is: it’s any model that learns and adjusts parameters from the data to achieve a particular goal (typically minimize some error function), rather than being explicitly hard-coded. I was taught that even simple linear regression can be considered machine learning. I don’t consider myself an expert in ML or CV by any means though, so please correct me if I’m wrong; maybe this is just a semantics issue.
You've got some bad answers here, but no, this isn't using machine learning. The program is using color-based thresholding to find the hand, and then finding the contours (outline) of the hand. From there it finds the convexity defects, which are where the outline falls into the inner shape, and counts how many of those there are. So if you hold up 5 fingers there's 4 big convexity drops towards the center (the spaces between your fingers). So if you did a Spock hand gestures for e.g., this would likely register it as "3." This is not a robust method, color-based thresholding is very sensitive (obviously) to the color of your skin, the lighting, and the background, and assumes it's the only thing of that color in the frame. Still, it's a fun example of something rather simple to do in OpenCV that actually doesn't take a *ton* of computer vision knowledge to try.

I enjoyed [Learn Python the Hard Way](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://www.souravsengupta.com/cds2015/python/LPTHW.pdf&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiJ_Ja_nJbhAhVk0oMKHeCWCPcQFjAAegQIBRAB&amp;usg=AOvVaw1lZdinaXvacmu_BS90KqSQ)
Yes please just do an online video and let us know
I am currently about half-way through this book. The chapters one and two are not well-written in my mind, if you do not already have experience with command prompt, files systems, etc. HOWEVER, once you are past the set-up stages and into the part where you start the python exercises, the book is amazingly well-written. I started with Automate the Boring Stuff with Python- ran into numerous issues. Didn't finish the book. Once I am done with LPtHW, I will go back to the other, but not until my understanding of Python is farther along. 
The author's description and their code doesn't line up. There is no ML in the code.
Oh sorry I was wrong, jinja2 template engine is the thing that was ripped out of Django. It says so on the jinja2 website
+1. OoenCV has a deep neural network module (`cv2.dnn`) and also has support for some simpler ML stuff like haar cascades and etc. However, this code isn't using any of that and isn't ML-based.
It is true that the book expects you to have terminal experience, but I believe it gives you a reference book to read before reading the python book. Knowing the Unix navigation is something that can get you very far with any programming language.
Very possibly it's a common project in computer vision courses. It's pretty easy to do, relatively little code, and teaches you what you can do with contours.
I didn't realize my boss was Indian
The inspect module seems to be for live object inspection. As mentioned before, the method I want to inspect is not part of my code but is received as string literal.
No, that's a fine definition. But many things in computer vision aren't learned things. For e.g., there's a technique called a "stroke width transform" to detect text in images. It takes an input of edges in the image (computed with a Canny edge detector or similar), then it finds the smallest distance between the edges. Areas in the image that are of close to constant width can be classified as text and run through an OCR program to read the text. The stroke width transform requires no training, doesn't have any parameters to tweak. Here's an image of what I mean by stroke width and distance between edges: https://images.app.goo.gl/gC3Bs7igcMMvmUqz6 And here's an example running on an image.to detect possible letter candidates: Transform-result-on-Thai-and-English-scripts.png These letter candidates can then get filtered out based on size and aspect ratio and location and so on.
To be honest, I don't know why I need an external library for this, when the stdlib will do this quite efficiently. &gt;&gt;&gt; from collections import namedtuple &gt;&gt;&gt; list(map(namedtuple("Pair",["letter","number"]), ["a","b"], [1,2])) [Pair(letter='a', number=1), Pair(letter='b', number=2)] Obviously, the namedtuple should be created once before the map call.
You've been told multiple times before to not take pictures of code with your phone and to post in /r/learnpython 
This is the first and i won't post again. And i was not told multiple times, this is the 2nd photo i have posted and the first commented warned me about it. 
According to the docs, you should always use `solve_ivp` for new code though it doesn't sound like `odeint` is deprecated. I am kind of surprised that there isn't some kind of callback mechanism. I bet if OP needed it enough (s)he could subclass the solvers to add it but that may be a lot to ask. A better option may be to include some check in the function if that is the only thing that changes. I guess it isn't clear what type of state needs to be modified

Sounds good!
From your post history. 7 Days ago in /r/Python: b1cz3h Text post. Told about /r/learnpython 5 days ago in /r/Python: b1vm6y Image post: Again told about /r/learnpython. Though you are correct, while it was an image no one commented about that. I was wrong on that regard, I apologize. 3 days ago in /r/learnpython: b2v4yx, text post. Looks successful, though it was a general learning question not a specific error. Nothing wrong with that 23 hours ago (shortly it'll be 1 day ago) in back in /r/Python: b3tk7d, text post. Again told about /r/learnpython Finally this post. So while you are right about this being the first time someone has clarified image posts to you, there have been many times where people have directed you to /r/learnpython. Given the sheer number I assumed in one of those someone had also address the image post before or that you might have read the r/learnpython guideline which urges against posting screenshots and images of code Askings is a great way to learn and I encourage it, but there's been lots of suggestions given to you that you don't seem to listen to. I strongly encourage you to go through the /r/learnpython resources you've been directed to. It will help both your programming and how you ask questions. 
Didn't use this myself (I learned the really hard way by not having a book) but a colleague did and he recommends it

No, not necessarily. Computer vision is a problem, machine learning is one possible approach to solve that problem.

Hey sorry for the bummer. Yeah this is a client. The server side implementation has to be too specific to your data source. If you're using Postgres you can checkout https://hasura.io. (Disclaimer: I'm one of the authors). It's a full-fledged automatic graphql api on top of your Postgres db. Supports subscriptions too.
This case, it's quite literally taxing the pixels, using a [brightness/color threshold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thresholding_\(image_processing\)) to figure out which pixels are "wall" and which are "hand" (top right), then creates a [convex hull](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_hull) around it. Both of those are very basic algorithms and have zero machine learning, statistical analysis or AI involved.
Does it still count correctly if you hold out your thumb and index finger?
REAL TIME NARUTO HAND SEAL DECODER!
IIRC the scipy.ode allows for more modification of the function solver (e.g. changing the solver to anything other than lsoda that odeint forces you to use). Is solve_ivp built on the ode framework or a separately developed function?

You're thinking of "permissions," generally speaking. Its a widely used concept to regulate access to objects, so you'll find simple implementations in some frameworks and will likely find a plug in of sorts for frameworks which do not include the functionality by default.

Maybe I should use this instead? [https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/auth/#overview](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/auth/#overview) &amp;#x200B; I think I can even find a cookiecutter template for it. 
I'm not very familiar with Django, but it looks like that will have you covered.
I've gone through the python bootcamp course on udemy, and while it was a pretty good primer and a good use of my 14$, I found it to accelerate REALLY fast towards the end to the point that I had to look at other resources to make up that gap. The two books that stood out to me most are Automate the Boring Stuff with Python (because you get to do a whole bunch of stuff and see concrete results fast, so it's motivating) and Learn Python 3 the Hard Way, because I'm visual and you have to read and then type all the code (I'm really enjoying it so far).
It's not a book and you can't take it til it opens up again (i think it's running from June next) but this is the best online course I've done - I did it before taking comp sci in university and it covered more than my programming 1 module. I can't recommend it enough. https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:MITx+6.00.1x+2T2017_2/course/ Ps - it's free 
[Think Python](https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python/) is a good book that's made for beginners and teaches not just an intro to the language, but also programming. It doesn't have the benefit of books like Automate the Boring Stuff or Sweigart's other books, of holding your hand through practical projects though. (That's not a criticism of AtBS, just a different style, and those practical results are super great esp for people new to programming to be able to make something real). It doesnt intend to drop you in the deep end though, and you should feel capable tackling some on your own projects afterward. If you've been learning html and css by playing around with it, then that shouldn't be a problem, and think python will set you up

Thank you so much for the library! It seems really easy to use it. I will give it a try. By the way, it is planned an easy integration with Google Colab notebooks?
&gt;I thought about using json but I cannot add data entries into an already written file with json Why? ^^^if ^^^CSV ^^^is ^^^a ^^^candidate
Why does that matter if it works?
Any particular reason for not using an actual database, such as MySQL, MariaDB, postgres, MongoDB, etc.? MongoDB does JSON. 
I don't know where to tell you to go, but this doesn't have anything to do with python. 
I've a project doing something similar, I use aws rds with mysql, i access it through pymysql, really straightforward 
CLI messages themselves are often quite useful. Bash is telling you that the alias you have created is pointing to a directory and that it is not an executable. You need to point that alias to the actual binary of your python3.7 installation. Also, you should not mix paths like that, especially mixing paths from different versions. You should look into pyenv for managing versions. I'm almost inclined to say that this post might belong to r/learningpython ; mods would know. 
Feature request— counting starting from thumb 
&gt;maybe the numpy in the folder I just added to the python path is conflicting &amp;#x200B; If there is any risk of this kind of mismatch I create a virtualenv and activate it so that there is always only one version of python and only one place for all installed modules. [https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html)
Yeah I figured mixing paths like that was a bad call but I was running out of options. I’ll try asking google where that binary would be and post on learnpython. Thanks for the help. 
How much data are we talking about? For everything below 100 MB you don't really need to worry about performance if all you're gonna do is scrape web pages. It's not too hard to make a JSON file work, but why not go for Sqlite if you are considering a relational database already? It's in the standard library and fast enough for many use cases. And it would be easy to switch to other products later since the APIs are pretty much aligned. But maybe this is already waay too fancy and at CSV file is all you need...
A lot of the sites I scrape have some pretty ugly and unstructured data - so most of the time I wind up just scraping to very large JSON files because I don't really know how exactly the data will look and I don't want to spend time on db schema until I have the data in hand. That said, I use atomic file writing to avoid the unpleasantness of killing a scrape in the middle of JSON serialization and winding up with a corrupted file. from contextlib import contextmanager from contextlib import suppress from pathlib import Path @contextmanager def replace_file(name): tmp_name = Path(f'{name}.tmp') name = Path(name) try: with open(tmp_name, 'w') as f: yield f tmp_name.replace(name) finally: with suppress(OSError): tmp_name.unlink() This is how it's used to write the JSON file... with replace_file(results_file) as f: json.dump(results, f) &amp;#x200B;
Zope has this built in, and I think you can take advantage of it Plone as well. &amp;#x200B; [https://docs.zope.org/zope2/zope2book/Security.html#authorization-roles-and-permissions](https://docs.zope.org/zope2/zope2book/Security.html#authorization-roles-and-permissions) &amp;#x200B; [https://training.plone.org/5/workflow/roles-and-permissions.html](https://training.plone.org/5/workflow/roles-and-permissions.html) &amp;#x200B;
Look further into that directory. There must be a `bin` directory that would contain various binaries for that version of python. Also consider using virtualenv as suggested by u/efmccurdy. Anyway, r/learnpython is better for question like this in future.

I've always wanted a tool for gists. You should put this up on PyPI so we can pip install it. If you need help with that send me a DM 
Django's auth module allows you to define your own permissions and test them with decorators. So, for example, you could define a permission "can\_flog\_wombats", add it to the User record for U23 (or the Group of which U23 might be a member), wrap a view like "flog\_wombats\_lightly" with a decorator that tests for your permission. In addition, there's a raft of "standard" permissions: "is\_staff", "create", "edit", "delete", ... which can be applied to models (=&gt; database table), views (web requests), and so on, and a simple mechanism for applying permissions to Users or Groups.
This feature is already built in without the need for yet another dependency: https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html#dataclasses.asdict This is yet another part of what separates Python from node.
Are there any interactive backends that have support for this kind of interactivity though? Configurable hover text on points? Ability to show/hide data series via click, brushing selections like the Parallel Coordinates and SPLOMs? I'd love to play with one if there is one!

Hi @stebox, &amp;#x200B; 1. Well, there is a couple of things. 1. Implementation of all Dependency Injector functionality could take 500-700 lines of code. It's something that we definitely could make for our project if it's big and long-term. 2. However, it might be too much if we talk about mid-size or small project. 3. Another factor is that when we go to our next project and we want to take our DI module with us - doing just copy-paste is not the best approach, right? 4. Also let's imagine that you have to continue development of already existing project and there is little DI framework implemented there, but we don't have any documentation or support on it. Not the best situation - it might be slightly better to have something more or less popular, supported and mature. 5. Making a summary, all mentioned use cases have happened to me and that's why Dependency Injector is currently an open source project. It was started as just a single module on one of the big projects, proved its usefulness and then was open sourced. 2. It's very nice question. I started rewriting Dependency Injector in Cython as an experiment, and finally decided to productize version 3 of Dependency Injector on Cython. Now, when it's done, I would say that I would think twice before doing something like that again. 1. Talking about beneficial things: 1. It's much faster... to describe how fast is it I would say that when we create an object with Factory provider it's equal to speed of just creating object. 2. It should be more optimal in terms of memory consumption. 2. Saying few words about downsides: 1. It's much harder to distribute. I would not go too deep into details, but in few words you need to enforce people install Cython with your library on their machines or make a bunch of additional work before publishing. 2. It is harder to contribute to... Unfortunately (or fortunately :) ) no so many people are familiar with Cython, so it's much harder to receive a contribution when your project is in Cython. 3. It's harder to develop. Cython is not so mature in the segment of meta-programming - some things that work in regular Python just does not implemented in Cython. Another question is that Cython makes some limitations to the code that it could make working really super-fast. &amp;#x200B; Hope it answers your questions. &amp;#x200B; Thanks, Roman
I'm not sure what you are attempting, but I recommend you start with buildout, it pulls the needed components together to get a runable system using those files.. &amp;#x200B; [https://zope.readthedocs.io/en/latest/INSTALL-buildout.html](https://zope.readthedocs.io/en/latest/INSTALL-buildout.html) [https://docs.plone.org/manage/installing/installation\_minimal\_buildout.html](https://docs.plone.org/manage/installing/installation_minimal_buildout.html) [https://pypi.org/project/pylons\_sandbox/](https://pypi.org/project/pylons_sandbox/) &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
 df['SYTFrameEnd'] = pd.to_datetime(df['SYTFrameEnd']).apply(lambda x: x.strftime("%m/%d/%Y"))
No. If you want that stuff use bokeh. Matplotib interactive backend give you a cursor and hover events. You could implement all those things on it, but mpl provides low level APIs for that so it will be... very verbose. 
 Puppy is a really vibrant Python community in Seattle. Really glad they're doing this.
In some languages, three is done with a thumb and two fingers, can it recognize that?
Does it really matter if you're the only one using that MacBook? Anyway, to sandbox, why not creating a simple Linux image from virtual machines (ex. VirtualBox...), then work inside? You can also use Docker for convenience. If it is your personal MacBook and doesn't tie to your work, just install Anaconda and start learning Python.

thanks is anaconda better than say miniconda+pyCharm? i don't think ill need all the stuff that anaconda comes with, i think i just need NumPy and pandas to start
Start with miniconda, you can always upgrade to full-fruit anaconda later.
If you want the code, dm me, I'll send it. This was a little personal project in a class of mine that requires typing. Modules used: PyAutoGUI PIL PyTesseract Time
Looks like it'd come in handy! Have you considered passing video iframe height and width as arguments with defaults?
can you make a tutorial on how to display the Album cover art which is in the mp3 file. Would really appreciate it!
Will it be recorded?
I think there might be a stream, I’m not 100% though. I at least heard rumors of that.
If you don’t already have Anaconda you can install it fine under your user account. If you use it already for work and want to keep the course separate from the work environment, create a conda environment for your course to keep the libraries you use sandboxed. 
requests probably?
Can you please give a sample code or a reference?
Which website are you working with? That would help
Maybe look at the [rauth](https://rauth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) package. It's what we use at work.
Deepl.com
Yandex? 
If you want something simple you can try this https://github.com/dpgaspar/Flask-AppBuilder
try registering with datacamp or udemy.
r/learnpython. Look at the sidebar. 
Pyramid Framework has a great permission model where every view has associated permission and you can implement client ACL any way you want with few lines of code. https://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid/en/latest/narr/security.html
step one: read the sidebar step two: /r/learnpython 
Start off with a small project, maybe a tool that can help you organize, and go for it. You'll learn more by doing rather than anything else. And prepare yourself for the fact that there's always more to learn.
I would recomand the free python courses from udacity. And also the book Automate the Boring Stuff with Python by Al Sweigart. The book is awesome.

Hello There are many Online Courses where you can acquire good knowledge and skills for Data Science . Some of the popular online courses are udemy , edureka which is very much Popular and well established. There are many people who get successful by pursuing Online course for Python from these Online Courses. You can be one of them too. But I personally believe that Python is not the type of Course which can be learnt properly through Online Courses. I think the best way to learn Python is through some [Classroom Courses for Python Certification](http://www.cetpainfotech.com/technology/python-training) Because we can get lots of extra skills and development which is not possible to acquire through any Online Courses. We can Enroll in any classroom Courses and read the online Courses as a Secondary .
Apart from also providing deserialization functionality, there are several [reasons to prefer jsons over asdict](https://jsons.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html#why-not-just-use-dict). For instance, ``dataclasses.asdict`` does not take properties (``@property``) into account. Also, ``asdict`` doesn't serialize everything properly, ``datetime`` instances for example. 
This.
Dice1 = str(Dice1) Try that with all variables.
str(dice_X) is providing a printable, string version of dixe_X. It isn't changing the variable dice_X. You need to assign that to a variable and use that in your list/string concatenation. E.g. dice_1_string = str(dice_1).
When you use the print function, your dice values are strings not integers which is why they can't be added.
r/learnpython is for these type of basic questions. But when you use `str(dice1)` it returns a string object, but you aren't assigning it to anything. If you want to replace dice1 with a string of the same value you need `dice1 = str(dice1)`.
its working, you didn't assign to another variable to the return value. 
Yup thx people it works now
Hi there, fastapi just came up at [https://www.reddit.com/r/flask/comments/b4bbnp/flaskclassful\_a\_serious\_choice\_for\_production/](https://www.reddit.com/r/flask/comments/b4bbnp/flaskclassful_a_serious_choice_for_production/)... I'm currently reading the tutorial, is it the case that the inbuilt type support negates the need to work with marshmallow / webargs?
A table is a flowable so it should automatically flow over onto the next page. Having a hard time understanding what you're trying to do. Maybe you should post a link to a text version of your code. If you want to insert a space or even a page between *multiple* tables then you need to insert a spacer or a page break.
Yep. Marshmallow, Webargs and family are great libraries that inspired a lot of what is done in FastAPI. In FastAPI you don't need them, you just use standard Python types and get validation, serialization and documentation from them. It is handled underneath by Pydantic.
Thanks for responding! That's very interesting. Also, the inbuilt OpenAPI / websocket / GraphQL support is mouthwatering. Luckily, my project is still small enough that I can probably refactor it into fastapi and see what it's like...
That's great! I would love to know how it goes :)
 print (str(dice1)+str(dice2)) would be the easist fix? 
Another quick one - how does it handle variations in schema validation, commonly found when 1) parsing query strings and 2) PATCHing various attributes. In marshmallow, I'd use a schema factory for that. I'm asking as PATCHing is generally tricky...
You can have multiple schemas/models. They can inherit from one another and override the requirements of attributes. So, you can have all (or many) fields required for POST and then all those fields optional for PATCH.
Okay, I feel reasonably secure. ;) I'll read the tutorial, skim the docs, and hack away. :D
Awesome!
Thank you :)
Thank you :)
Sure, thank you :)
Thank you so much.
Thanks a lot. On it!
I wrote a tool in Python called [dip](https://github.com/amancevice/dip) to leverage docker-compose to do this sane thing!
I try to build a simple Poker HUD 
The problem with this is that the docker daemon runs in a users GUI domain on macos. This means you cannot ssh into a macos box and run a docker container without also logging into the GUI. You also cannot run a docker container as a service. TLDR: awesome trick for Linux. Maybe not for macos. Definitely not for a BSD. Any one know about windows?
The original question is if this program “uses machine learning in any way”, and from what I understand it is. The first step is training it if you look in the repo. If you it isn’t could you explain why not? Thanks.
How much is the full course?
Json.dumps from stdlib does what your example does in the same number of characters.

Not python and probably the sql sub isn't for noobs either.
I don't think `pd.concat([statistics[section], df])` does what you think. I'm assuming you want `statistics[section] = df` instead... 
After a quick look at the demo of your mouse data, I am not yet sure sure how to use that for my calcium imaging data of neuronal cell culture since I am relatively new to programming... I will definitely have a more thorough view. I really love the idea of using Python more in science :) At the moment I am also trying to write a python code for my data analysis.
I can safely say I've never ssh'd into a Mac OS box
Could you provide a working code example that shows how ``json.dumps`` can turn a dataclass instance as in the example to a dict? ``json`` from the stdlib covers a different purpose than ``jsons``. Where the former turns dicts to strings and vice versa, the latter turns objects to dicts and vice versa.

Over the last weeks I've been working on a BracketPro monitoring tool (watch how brackets change over time, based on the amount of votes on each item in a bracket, from a 3rd party/black box perspective). I'm using a Python backend, and a JavaScript + VueJS frontend, and I've been attempting to use TypeScript for the first time to go with it. The Python backend is working fine, and has successfully collected information for 3 weeks (on a 10 minute interval). The typescript part on the other hand... If Python is your main/preferred language, Typescript is a hell when you're starting out. Not because of the statically typed aspect, but because of the quality of the documentation. I'm longing for something like docs.python.org, but instead I've to work my way through the "[official docs](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/home.html)", followed by the changelog because quite a few syntax related things don't make it to the official docs and are only mentioned somewhere deep inside the changelog. Stackoverflow provides better documentation for this mess, than the official docs do. If there's one thing I've learned over time when using Python, it is that it's rare to find documentation, whether for frameworks, libraries, or the language itself, as good as the official Python docs and several of the most used libraries created in/for Python. Even just using Sphinx for the documentation already improves the readability a lot. 
i prefer a christmas type pattern, or something with cartoons on it
haha
Wish I could upvote you twice. The whole point of docker is to wrap up all of those random dependencies so if it runs on my machine, it runs on any OS in the solar system without special setup.
In a Python CLI script? Java? C#? Wat. I was answering the content of the article, not your imagination.
Can’t you use homebrew to install docker, which then gets installed as a launchd service meaning it’s run as root and detached from any login session? Never done it myself so I’m not sure.
I'm not watching this 💩

Kinda off topic but does anyone else struggle with reading Clint CLIT
Good idea! I added it :)
Might want to base on 3.7-alpine to reduce the overall docker image size. And the --no-cache-dir argument to your pip installation command might help a little bit.
If you know python and you are familiar with Qt from C++, then you are ready to go.
Thanks for this great advice. 
Ok i'll do that, and thanks for suggestion.
You weren’t though... the article is arguing for an artifact that would work on a machine that didn’t have Python, much less virtualenv, with only a running Docker daemon as a requirement. Your reply to the OP assumes the presence of the specific Python interpreter version your app requires, as well as at the very least virtualenv... apples and oranges. The generalized idea of using containers this way isn’t bad, but it’s intended for people who don’t mind trading system resources for determinism.
😱 why

No man! Its my effort for the beginners
No, it's spam.
I like how it’s insane to expect a machine to have a python interpreter on it, but a docker daemon running is perfectly normal.

No its not, I am a student and I made this video
You might be a student, but you're trying to promote your youtube channel on /r/Python. That's spam. Stop it.
A code like: &amp;#x200B; try: something = next(iterable) except StopIteration: ... &amp;#x200B; is the fastest way to do such things in Python, go for it without hesitation.
The python `for` statement is basically a `try-except` in disguise in that it loops through any iterable and stops when a `StopIteration` error is raised. It seems you can just use the for loop for this purpose without using explicit indexing like `for elem in list`. This is generally the preferred way to loop over a list in python. If you want the index as well for other purposes use `for i, elem in enumerate(list)`. You can of course use an explicit try except where it is necessary.
Could you elaborate more about what you mean? 
Thanks!
I dont have right place for it 🙁
You guys are really hung up on the fact that he used a simple Python script as his example. Did you want him to build a complex data science pipeline with Python, R and C++ as the first chapter in a thesis-length blog post?
The article mentions a whole list of languages and environments. A simple Python script was only used as the example.
The world has changed. In reality though it’s not that it’s insane; the machine probably has Python... but it might not have the specific version of Python you want. Or more likely it doesn’t have the specific PyPy or even MyPy version you want. One Docker install gets you many containers all of which may be using mutually incompatible interpreters / dependencies. The containers go a long way towards solving those sort of problems, at the cost of system resources.
I think you may have forgotten to attach the picture. Also can you share your code?
Based on this, I don't think you need to call yourself an "aspiring" developer. (Unless you mean professional developer?)
It isn't. See my longer answer for how it works. There is no training. The "training" is a script that *you* can modify and find the color threshold values that work for your hand. In other words, *you* train it! Not a program! Lol

I do get what your sarcasm is based on, but there's a lot to do after just detecting the eye frames. A major part of my article is about that post-frame stage. Didn't know using pre-trained models makes an article superficial.
Raymond Hettinger gave a talk at Pycon (?) a few years ago. You can find the video on YouTube. In it, he showed that there are a few approaches you can take. He started with a “direct” transformation where the python wrapper was basically 1-to-1 with the underlying API. Then, he showed how wrapping that underlying API (Java originally) in a Python context manager could simplify and better abstract out the boilerplate. It is less a “use this pattern” talk and more a “think about what you’re wrapping and figure out how we’d like to do it in Python” talk. I’ll see if I can find that talk when I get home. 
Good response. 
One that works.
This will never be useful in Python in any way.
i remember watching that, but I can't find it now. Do you remember which year it was? 
Ffs throw exceptions. This is gross and awful. 
Maybe [this one](https://pyvideo.org/pycon-us-2011/pycon-2011--api-design--lessons-learned.html)?

`Import time` for example will allow you to use: `time.sleep(4)` But `from time import sleep` will allow you to use sleep() directly like this: `sleep(4)`

It gives me the same result on the normal command line : &amp;#x200B; pip install SendKeys File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1 pip install SendKeys \^ SyntaxError: invalid syntax
Wrong working directory, I'm guessing.
In the cmd.exe it tells me this : &amp;#x200B; 'pip' is not recognized as an internal or external command, an executable program or a batch file.

I figured, Pyvideo is a great index for PyCons. Enjoy!
I’m running it from the directory where both scripts are located. Maybe because the scripts aren’t located in the same path as the python executable? I’ll add the path the scripts are in to the path env variable and see if that works. 
I feel that you need to use Boolean algebra and some sort of state machine to cut down on that horrificness
How are you running your PowerShell script? By double clicking it? I'm not sure that would put it in a correct working directory. 
I use VS Code for the IDE and run it from there typically, but also just call it from PowerShell command line as .\\script.ps1 with same results.
Hmmm, still didn't work. still saying 'File not found'
Oh. You have `$script` as a single argument in your script, so PowerShell passes it as a single argument, and Python attempts to run the entire line as a file name. I'm not sure what the exact syntax is, but if you really need it to be one string, you can tell PowerShell to split it into separate arguments. Also, why are you using PowerShell to run a Python script, anyway? 
I has used Nginx-Unit in production to run my flask applications. The documentation is not yet really well detailed. But they have recently added this part [HOW TO](https://unit.nginx.org/howto/). For my personnal experience, I used to spliting my Flask application from the Unit service in order to use the unittest more easily. You can find an example [here](https://github.com/pycabook/rentomatic/tree/chapter-2-http-api-step-3). It is an excerpt from a project found in this [book](https://leanpub.com/clean-architectures-in-python) (which can be obtained for free, you can donate something to him too). It is preferable to use virtualenv (*home* field), instead of trying to install python module from apt-get (it's possible and it can work). Unit can load a config file by the command : curl --unix-socket /path/to/control.unit.sock It seems also possible to directly modify the live configuration by writting on this unix-socket. But it's still a tricky part. Unit is really powerful but it is still a recent project. They have just added the possibility to run Java for example.
Ouch brutal. Flip your 'if' statement logic, so you print an error then return early. Then the 'else' statement isn't required and you can denest. 
/r/learnpython read the sidebar
Oh sorry
That's along the lines of what I'm thinking as well, that for some reason it's trying to run the whole thing as a filename when executed during the PS script, but not when run manually. Just don't know why or how to fix it. To answer the last question...this particular use case had me needing to call an unpublished/undocumented API for our wireless access point controller (Ubuquiti) to regularly check to see if an access point is in an offline state. We randomly have them go offline and I've no idea why, and the "fix" is reset the switch port. The stuff that I found online about the Ubiquiti API was all done in PS, so I built that part first. Once I got that working, I started looking into how to log into the switch and make a configuration change. I spent some time with Ansible, but it seems that because of the wonky SSH implementation on our switches (Brocade FCX/ICX series), Ansible just doesn't work. I know Python is the back end of Ansible, and so I started going down that route, not knowing really anything about Python. I found this Netmiko module that specifically is tested to work with our switches and pretty quickly was able to determine that is was going to work, I just needed to figure out a way to call the Python script from my existing PS script. Because frankly, I've never touched Python until two days ago (although after I take an exam here pretty soon for a cert, next on my list is to learn Python). I imagine Python would very nicely do the API calls to the Ubiquiti system, I just figured based on a little research that it would be easier to just go this route, rather than try to learn how to do the API calls in Python. I'm so close I really would like to make this work, but if I can't then I will just do it all in Python...eventually.
Post your PowerShell code then. 
This is a good one. May I ask you to mention it in the comments section of the article? This way, my blog’s readers will get to know about it too. Thanks!
[args.live](https://args.live) is already going to evaluate to false if it is empty, so you can get rid of that duplicate check to start. Then do what /u/Glycerin said and put the bad case logic that exits first, and then don't put the good case in an else clause, just have it follow. &amp;#x200B;

Python 2?!?!?
That's not how one should do error handling. Holy shit. &amp;#x200B; [https://realpython.com/python-exceptions/](https://realpython.com/python-exceptions/) &amp;#x200B; [https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html)
If all you're doing is literally just printing the error message of the exception and exiting why in seven hells wouldn't you just raise the exception There's SO much wrong with this so I don't even know where to begin. Holy hell
Funny you should suggest that. I did at one point try to put the parameters into an array and then call the array. I didn't save exactly how I did it, but I know it didn't work. I'll re-visit that though, I've not done a ton of stuff with arrays so I easily could have just done it wrong. Thanks!
Replace the last line with `python $pyscript $ipaddr $port`. Also, you can trivially do this with the `requests` module in Python. 
Spend the time to learn and use argparse. It can do all of these for you. Sub commands, choices, custom messages, custom check functions and more. It can (and will) be frustrating but, please, don't give up.
He doesn't need a state machine. It only looks complicated because it's written incredibly badly. It's honestly incredibly trivial what it's doing. He could cut this travesty down a lot if he just followed a few best practices
Same with args.refresh. I think this was purposely written badly to rile us up as a joke. Or at least I hope so
You'd think so, but I've refactored code like this a bunch. Some people got taught "one exit point" and so they nest everything rather than return early. &amp;#x200B;
Pyspark.sql
You did not get screwed over, you just learned an important lesson: the environment you are in changes all the time 😆
I have the impression Unit is missing a gui for the config, for cli work I prefer the way nginx works, I make a change then `nginx -t` and then `nginx -s reload` if that worked. This way of sending json every time I want to change something feels weird, like playing with an API endpoint by hand. 
Like you said, for big projects, yes. For example, killing all open sessions is different between psql 8 and 9. The risk is high when moving between major versions. That being said, if I were in charge, I wouldn't pin versions at all. Rather, have a pipeline dedicated to alerting if upgrades break anything and putting aside reduces every sprint for fixing these bugs. Mostly because pinning versions quickly becomes a sickness in the product that's hard to yank out and you're left with extremely old packages simply because "there was never time to test an upgrade". Once upgrading is part of the dev cycle, it hurts less.
Yeah this is college level code. In college I learnt C, C++ and Java mostly the wrong way and we'd nest our if conditions into a gigantic monstrosity. I thank the stars I met a mentor who taught me to write neat conditionals and just return or throw an exception early so you wouldn't have to execute anything later
I can’t laugh now dude. I’m in so much pain now
Thanks for your viewpoint. I think there's some wisdom in your observation about pinning becoming a "sickness" and in doing frequent, tested upgrades.
If you want just a clean message you can just throw a custom exception, catch it on a higher level, and handle it by printing and exciting
Totally awesome. I love seeing people make cool stuff. Nice work. 
 Starting with Python 3.4, pip is included by default with the Python installers. If you have pip.exe, it should be in the Scripts folder (like this C:\\Users\\User\\...\\Python\\Scripts). To use the short name of the program in the terminal (pip), you must specify the path to the file pip.exe in the environment variables. And specifically in the variable "path". You can see if the path to the pip is set. Get the list in cmd.exe: echo %path:;=&amp;echo.% If the path (C:\\Users\\User\\...\\Python\\Scripts) is not specified, you can add it manually.
