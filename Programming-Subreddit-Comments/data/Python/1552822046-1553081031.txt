I'm more looking for a plugin for pycharm. Right-click -&gt; convert to json or paste as json, something like that
Not a lot to go on from just this statement. Depending on how you added your lock, you may be serializing all your threads so that they only run sequentially anyway. Plus Python threads tend to be sequential unless some time or network or file i/o operation is being done, in which case they can do overlapping work. But if the threads are all doing CPU-intensive work, then they will not really go any faster than non-threads. In Python, you have to use multiprocessing in order to get multiple cores running, and that's when you'll see potential time gains. (See this recent webinar from JetBrains on the whole parallelism topic - [https://youtu.be/F19R\_M4Nay4](https://youtu.be/F19R_M4Nay4) . The title says it focuses on async/await, but it also discusses threading and multiprocessing.)
Ya I have posted there as well thanks 
I had the same realization when I first used the new `__matmul__` operator. I didn't like it at first: Why introduce an operator that's only relevant to NumPy but not useful anywhere else? But as soon as I started using it I fell in love: ((A @ B) + C) @ D is simply much more readable and easier to work with than (A.dot(B) + C).dot(D)
Pulling the cable is probably not a fair comparison. tcp/ip is designed to be very resilient against hardware failure, so it won't register a disconnect for some time (its os dependent). This is true of any websocket library. You can tell Lomond to send a ping and force a disconnect if it doesn't get a reply. See the `ping` and `ping_timeout` parameters. This is unlikely to be what is happening with your network services, which probably are disconnecting tcp/ip cleanly. Unless it stays connected and stops sending you messages, which is a different problem entirely. Anyway, this is the solution I proposed in diagram form: ┌─────────────────┐ ┌─────────────────┐ │ DC1 │ │ DC2 │ │ │ │ │ │ .─────────────. │ │ .─────────────. │ │( getmsg.py )│ │( getmsg.py )│ │ `────────┬────' │ │ `─────┬───────' │ └──────────┼──────┘ └───────┼─────────┘ │ │ push push │ .─────────────. │ └─▶( REDIS )◀──┘ `─────────────' │ pop │ .──────▼──────. ( readqueue.py ) `─────────────' 
This kind of sounds like you want asyncio here, and not threads. 
But nobody knows the answer, apparently!
Why? What is your end goal here? 
`{**d1, **d2}`
Yeah that makes more sense. That's how we have a lot of things built now -- except we push to rabbitmq and let a consumer handle it so API workers have a single responsibility Thanks for your reply!
I'm currently making a hangman game, but I don't have a way of converting such a large amount of words in to double-quotes or converting to json in PyCharm, I know it's not necessary for this project, but being able to create json files from an external list quickly would be nice for other projects. 
Why use JSON at all? If all you need is a bag of words, just store them in a plaintext file.

Cool! I normally use Celery for that (you might be using it with RabbitMQ), it can run even on different machines. Background tasks would probably be only for small jobs in situations in where having a full Celery with RabbitMQ/Redis seems like an overkill. E.g. sending an email notification. &amp;#x200B; In fact, the project generators I have for FastAPI include Celery set up in that way.
The companies with old TFS protocol repos I've seen have all self hosted. The ones I am familiar with are medical. My company is in the cyber security industry and we are quite comfortable with Azure DevOps. Even medical is starting finally to explore cloud solutions for services now though. It's slow, but it used to be hard to imagine.
‘dict_ = {key: idx for idx, key in enumerate(words)}’ Then json.dump to disk. 
`python -m http.server` for a quick dev server from the command line. [aiohttp](https://aiohttp.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for any kind of custom server code.
So, essentially you format Java code in a weird way to make braces and semicolons less obvious. And you prefix comment lines with #. What’s the point? Strangely formatted Java is just that. It has nothing to do with Python. Just the supposed “Python part” of the first line alone … public class QuickstartSample … has two syntax errors. Python doesn’t have a `public` keyword and a colon is missing at the end. As a joke it’s mildly funny – maybe. For anything else it’s useless.
You have the perfect tool for a task like this already in your hands! Despite the fact that there are other ways to do what you intend to do - you can just write your own python script that builds the desired data structure from any list that you give as input! If you look for a convenient way in your IDE with a „right-click -&gt; foo“ solution what does that tell about you being (or trying to be) a good programmer? 
Through fiddling, I have also got a unary postfix class working, \`\`\` class Postfix(object): def \_\_init\_\_(self, func): self.func = func print('init') def \_\_ror\_\_(self, other): print('ror') return self.func(other) &amp;#x200B; @Postfix def negate(x): return x \* -1 &amp;#x200B; print(4|negate) &amp;#x200B; \`\`\` &amp;#x200B;
Obviously when contributing to a project, I use whatever style the project does. And when I start new ones, I use black more and more. Even though it uses spaces instead of tabs and `"` instead of `'`, its benefits outweigh my stylistic disagreements.
ugh, I hope you don’t have any project I might want to contribute to or use one day
Then write a function to do that...that doesn't sound like something an ide will do for you. "Right click, solve any problem"
You must close serial port connection when you've done with `arduino.close()`. Btw, traceback isn't an error, it's just the logs Python presents to you to understand an error (like that IndexError).
Only asking because I've used NuGet packages in VS to do this as a "right-click -&gt; paste as json"
Have you looked official Python docs?
I thought d1.update(d2) was taking the union and putting it in d1? So d1 + d2 equals d1 | d2
Alright, will play around more with Lomond, I like the persist stuff so long as it actually reacts when it gets disconnected. I'm assuming with two machines pushing messages into Redis that, because whatever you're pushing into has to have a unique identifier, that if it already exists because the one DC created it, that the other has nothing to do. But what if there's enough of a delay between the two DC's? You pop out your item (I'm guessing you'd use BLPOP), and DC2 then recreates it after you've pop'd it. Sorry for all the questions!
that was dumb
Hello I can understand your policies, after it could be better to signal it before to post something. Best regards
even if there was that option, what you're describing wouldn't work. you're wanting the IDE to know how to arbitrarily convert one data structure to another. you want the IDE to know that it should convert an array into an object using each array value as the object key and the index as the value. aside from just being weird, there's no way the IDE can know what is going on in your head 
Thanks and that brings up a good point. AIOHTTP is often used for websockets, right? With Django, websockets is a square peg in a round hole. We're going to see how much work it is to create a websocket (minimal chat app) using Python3, http.server and a few other basic libraries. &amp;#x200B; Again, we're doing this for testing &amp; sharing purposes. For production, public facing ports we use popular open source frameworks &amp; servers. 
What I like about your reply is how you are able to come up with objective arguments... 
thanks. your comment was objectively dumb, so there i didn't feel the need to elaborate
why use an IDE at all! just program everything! you're genius! why haven't we thought of this before!?! r u matar progrmmer!?
Writing some software for a youth club to help manage member info (using Django) Doing some stuff at work involving Python, flask and microservices &amp;#x200B;
Python is used for a lot of things and for sure it's not there `for the sake of being there`. You can use python for whatever you want to. You can make a website, you can make games, you can make CLI utilities, you can write exploits, you can use it for binary exploitation, you can use it for ML project and lots of other things. I mean it totally depends on you, on how you want to use python. 
Python is used heavily for: - web services (Django, flask) - machine learning (tensorflow, scikit, torch etc.) - data cleaning and analysis (Jupyter, pandas, beautiful soup) - scripting tasks, builds, deploys, larger applications etc. It is ridiculously versatile and there's a reason why it's one of the most popular languages around. Not so much for (but still possible): - game programming (pygame) - GUI programming
It looks like your user input line is not indented correctly. What happens if you fix the indent? Also, what did the do_123 function do?
Go read some beginners tutorials on python, figure out loops (they are a basic construct of the language and you will need them), and then make it go. This is a very simple program and anything other than a loop will be more complicated than just learning the basics of the language you are trying to work in. No shortcuts.
Why? Performing a json dump of a large list seems like the quickest way to get said list as json.
i like your line, very guido-esque.
&gt;line 220 As I thought, there has to be context for this. The code you provided cannot cause this error. Are you overwriting `input` somewhere?
Reading/writing to the terminal works similarly to reading/writing a file. In both cases, there's a *handle* the program uses that let's the operating system to know where to route the input or output. Once a handle is closed, you can't read or write using the handle anymore. `input()` reads from the standard input handle. Something in your program is closing that handle.
ok, thanks for the response. I have actually heard of Django but i never actually look at what it was, thats pretty much exactly what I was looking for. Thank you. Thats enough to point me in the right direction
 do\_123 gives infos to the threads so they know what to do
I use python for all new development, period. Web services, automation, GUIs, network stuff, system maintenance, orbit propagation, digital signal processing...in short, **everything**.
no i just check what user\_input\[0\] is and then repeat the while loop.. interesting is that if i only have 1-3 threads the error dont happen.. I have a cpu\_wait func build in, in case the cpu is overloaded.
OP is searching for a feature of the IDE. /u/almueh is saying regardless of the feature's potential existence, it should be ignored and the wheel re-invented, and that using IDE features is a sign of a bad programmer. this specific case is a simple thing to do, sure, but the whole point of IDEs is to unify, or *integrate*, common tasks so you don't have to manually do them, many of which are very simple. that's why it was dumb
You have an incorrect indent: while 1: user_input = input().split(" ", 1) should be: while 1: user_input = input().split(" ", 1) And I highly doubt you can run multiple threads at a time that all ask the user for input. Why are you multi-threading something that requires user input? If you need to do something with the user's input quickly on multiple threads, get each of their inputs first then run it through the threading.
I'm actually going to watch all the parts, thanks
my bad.. the coppy/past didn't work well.. the indent is correct.. I updatet it
My second point still stands, 1 thread is asking for input while the 2nd or 3rd hits the I/O error.
No u dont unterstand.. the threads dont use an input.. just the main func and this passes the input to all threads 
As others have said, use code to transform it. Or leave it alone until you need it in code and transform it in memory then instead. However! Frequently I find one off text mangling scenarios like this can be quickly solved with unix text processing tools. My goto is to do things in vim unless I need a pipeline or fully featured programs. Not quite your scenario here, but I will often have a list of strings that I want to use in Python or SQL, so I'll transform them with something like `s/.*/"&amp;",/` to quote every line and add commas. The issue using that approach with your scenario is that you want a dictionary with effectively line numbers for values which is possible in vim/sed/awk but really painful and at that point...just do it in Python
This runs and works properly by itself so something outside of what you've shown us is causing your error: def main(): while 1: user_input = input().split(" ", 1) if user_input[0] == "123": print(user_input) main() Is main() being run by each thread? 
No.. I think it was because of the threads giving output.. i commented it out and now its working
Well OP was stating he was having “a hard time googling it...“ While having a hard time to search for this functionality and posting on reddit and waiting for an answer to pop up... it may have been possible and the faster solution to just do it on his own. - Or if there is in fact a lack of the plug-in, create it for everyone else to also benefit, from him finding this. Also u/snaftyroot: For sure no one wants to re-invent the wheel and I’m also seeking for tools/plugins/whatever to make my life easier... But I‘m not quite sure if being dependent on an IDE‘s features is desirable. Which is of course a statement that is up for a discussion, that you unfortunately refused to have. 
Me too!
I think the string concatenation is still fine: even though it's not commutative, it's still symmetric in a less formal sense, since the resulting strings contain the same characters and since strings are fundamentally ordered. On the other hand, dict merging is much less intuitive, because dictionaries are unordered (well, that's not exactly true as of recently, but still). I think that would make an operator much more confusing. For example: d1 = {'a': 1} d2 = {"a': 2} assert d1 + d2 == d2 assert d1 + d2 != d1 assert d2 + d1 == d1 assert d2 + d1 != d2 In contrast, a member function makes that asymmetry much clearer. If you switched the `==` and `!=` in the above assertions, I think most people would find that just as (un)intuitive.
The problem is; you assign both Tic and Tac to same parameter. You need to assign them separately and then do the simplification between them.
this worked. thanks a ton
I apologise if this should be in /r/learnpython. I misclicked it, but I think maybe this question might be better here anyway.
You tryna build a time machine or somethin?
I can't see the indentation, because your post is incorrectly formatted. Testing is an essential skill for programmers, and reading your post is a test. So I will guess that you define this variable inside the function `gameloop`, and then later try to use it outside of that function, and this won't work because functions don't leak. You should define it outside of the function and pass it in as an argument. You should also use /r/learnpython for questions like this, as explained in the subreddit rules.

In maths, + on a set probably doesn't do what most people think it does. Sets use | for union, to "concatenate" sets.
This also doesn't hold true for floating point. 
But multiplication commutes
Same with list concatenation! 
Sorry I will move the question there
The dying industry I'm referring to is print media. I was a news editor at a major daily newspaper before it was bought and consolidated. My relationship with ML/AI is complicated by the fact that even though I know quite a bit up through gradient boosted forests, I'm half convinced it's going to result in massive societal damage. I mean, I don't have a crystal ball or anything, I guess like lots of older folk (geez, I'm only 48) I'm risk averse and I don't want to blame myself if self-driving trucks put 15% of the country on unemployment or China starts assassinating world leaders with autonomous drones. 
Tell me about it. One of the reasons I'm in this pickle is that my last company kept me so busy I I couldn't keep up with my learning. And then I got fired for it! So ironic.
Well, you can see that side of things if you choose to. It's really about where you choose to direct your imagination. Myself, I see ML being used to diagnose illnesses; improve physical security through surveillance; improve understanding of wildlife habitats &amp; migration routes through surveillance; improve protection of wildlife through poacher/trespassing surveillance; etc. I see tons of use of image/audio/video recognition tools that are not nefarious.

/r/learnpython and show them what you've worked out so far yourself. No body is doing your homework for you.
Check learn python community for your question as the bot suggests. Some tips I could provide: - Do not stress for your homework; you are a human being like everyone else, and with training you will accomplish your task. - Sit back, take a sheet of paper and try to design what you want to achieve. It will help you to understand the different step to reach your goal. - An essential function to enter the quantity needed: input() Check the documentation to understand how it works. Enjoy coding, the best part is the look back at the journey 😉 
No, d1.update(d2) is not the same as d2.update(d1). Imagine if d1 had `"apple": 1` and d2 had `"apple": 5" as key, value pairs. Combining d1 and d2 is not associative.
We use [climatecontrol](https://github.com/daviskirk/climatecontrol) which allows us to mix and match settings files (yaml, json, toml) and environment variables to configure our applications. The approach is a bit more "automatic" than vypers (which can be great or bad depending on what you're looking for). I'm the author and happy to help anyone interested in using it. 
well for me.. I can't hit the ctrl without looking at the keyboard. I can hit anything in the top row though without breaking my concentration. I think that's why I like typing clear()
so basically, your total cost is 2.34 times how many you sold, your total revenue is 6.99 times how many you sold. The total profit is the total cost minus the total revenue. In python a simple program would be: sold_units = input("How many units were sold?") total_cost = 2.34 * sold_units print("The total cost is", total_cost) You can figure out the rest

In the case of integers or real/complex numbers, yes. But in the framework of algebra, it usually denotes a non commutative operation. An example would be matrix multiplication.
I think Anaconda is the best way to go. Takes care of a lot of headache for you.
Aiohttp is a general web framework that's based on the asyncio module from the stdlib. Working in event-driven environments like networking without using async syntax and APIs built around them is generally like a square peg in a round hole.
Ah, cool. Good to know those exist. Been a while since I've coded in Python.
Yup. It's a new install method that beats out the installer from python.org https://docs.python.org/3.7/using/windows.html#windows-store
Looks genuine: [https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#the-microsoft-store-package](https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#the-microsoft-store-package), but not a great way to install it yet.
Uhh, what. Do you mean `pip freeze` or something?

That tool is effectively unmaintained, and has been for years.

Totally. For personal I use black and flake8 with my editor set to format/lint on save from the outset and then I just stop worrying about what I like. If you know what I mean.
That page is way outdated, and there is no such thing in current Debian packages. Use pyinstaller.
Oh, that's sad. Thank you for the info
You can use ide’s to pick out the version that best fits your project. Pycharm has this feature at least (the free version)
I didn't know, that's 😀
Seems not all that helpful. Am I to believe that the BigchainDB ledger will exist forever. I’d love for someone to post why/how this tech would be helpful. 
Use Jupyter, and Pandas. Then things like gender selection are easy, and you have a proper interface.

with open(file_name) as file: lines = file.readlines() - if your info in the line is for example - name : surname : gender - the separator is ':' gender = 'Male' for line in lines: info = line.strip('\n').split(':') if info[2].strip(' ') == gender: print(info[0], info[1]) I think this should work
/r/learnpython
Understood. We run the Waitress web server on some embedded systems, which uses an async model, but I'm going to consider AIOHTTP for these systems. I didn't realize it had such a big community until looking at the activity on its Github page today. Thanks. [https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp](https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp)
Same!
As the bot has told you in the past, I suggest asking this sort of question on /r/learnpython 
What kind of things are you interested in utilising Python for? Is it work, recreation or study? 
Stop fiddling with your environment and just write code.
I always recommend attempting a project close to your heart. Not a toy problem, not some prefabricated walkthrough, something you actually want to see in the world. It’ll be hard. You’ll probably have to change the scope along the way. But if you attempt it, honestly, you’ll broaden your skills and maybe you’ll bring something valuable into the world.
So are you saying that you use ctrl l even when just using a Bash console? I type 'clear' faster than I can think 
The windows store limits PATH modification by an executable in a way that breaks current c-extension packages such as NumPy. Hopefully by the time python 3.8 is released that will be resolved. See https://bugs.python.org/issue36085. While the latest NumPy works around this, many other packages will fail to load.
I would be interested in using it for anything it can be used for. 
Yes it's great! Play around a bit, maybe it fits your use cases

Shut up
Exactly. It's not important. Having a sensible consistent style that everyone follows (or autoformatting) is important.
No, they won't be. Big (and potentially breaking) changes like that are only released as part of feature releases.
Honestly I tried to learn python several times as a kid and never found something that made it really stick. Now, I use python most days at work in a bioinformatics position. The problem with not having a direction you want to go is that you’ll run out of tutorial material very quickly and won’t have something interesting to keep practicing with. Is there a repetitive task at work that you want to automate? Maybe you want to get a raspberry pi and play around with coloured lights or cameras. There are plenty of fun things to do with python so try to start with a question or problem and work from there.
As mentioned already in the comments I would find something that interests you. What hobbies do you have in life? Is there something useful you could build for it? Is there something you do at work that you could automate? Try to build something with some APIs you find online, maybe you want to scrape data from web pages to fill a database and then present it through a GUI.
It's pretty great. It handles lots of common things for you like certain security features, authentication and users, forms, etc. 
No, that's that new versions are for.

In my case, there is nothing more pleasant than making your computer interact with the real world. Throw an Arduino to your project and learn how to control lights, keep track of the temperature of your home (you can combine it with Flask or Django to have an online logger, for example). Learn how to use the webcam (you can get yourself a Raspberry Pi) to do some nice computer vision tricks (identify faces of your guests, for example). But, as almost everybody else said, the best is to start by your own motivation. Find what do YOU want to do. Python is a programming language, so basically you can do whatever your computer already does, but your own way. From building a web browser, to a calculator, to making plots of complex data, to develop games. So, what are you choosing? 
Thanks!
Did something similar with flask for long running ML model training as a POC but ultimately ended up creating a AWS Step functions moving training backend to a set or lambdas and ECS tasks. Found it much easier to scale and starting a job is just as easy and the AWS Step function UI is much better than the flower UI imo. Good write up though. 
Hope it helps introducing a new tool!

What about all-minus-one cross validation?
Can you share some code?
Have a read of the [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/index) over on /r/learnpython
I will. Thanks a lot!
Makes a lot of sense, will makes the changes.
Do you know of frameworks that accepts an API contract as you suggest?
Think of different project ideas and make them. That is one of the best ways I have found to learn new things in python while still feel like your programming for fun has a purpose. Also, when you feel comfortable with python I do recommend learning how to use C and linux, especially how to use linux's terminal.
Thank you. I will start thinking of projects!
No :'( Truly the worst decision in Python's otherwise excellent design.
Depends on your runtime environment requirements, but looking at your name, I can see you're probably doing this on a research project. Having said that, I'd recommend you look at [pyzmq](https://pyzmq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for this type of stuff. It's what they use at CERN (or at least was for a while, haven't checked in years), and while it is suspiciously simple in structure and api, the minor boilerplate it deals with will save you hours of problems.
More gradual than the teen years it took to phase out 2.7? K
Yes, it'll be added to all earlier versions of python 3.x in version 3.8.
Totally. A lot of beginners struggle with deciding what to build, and they get overwhelmed with language features and such. Because you have already done R, try to replicate what you did in python. That is a solid way of learning with lesser chances of side tracking.
TTS = text-to-speech? This isn't a python question, it's a linguist one (or something).
 list(map(lambda x: abs(x-1), var)) # [0, 4, 3, 2, 8, 3] I'd very much argue this is easier to read: [abs(x-1) for x in var] Depends on your standard at work of course, but I much prefer list/set/dict/generator comprehensions for anything that might be a map or filter, simply because it's easier to read. Lambdas are nice, especially for functions that take functions like `sorted` and such, but sometimes just writing the whole def is easier to read as well. It can get modified later easily, you can have a docstring, and it can be used more than once without redefining the lambda in another `sorted`. I think lambdas are more interesting from a teaching standpoint than a practical one just because it really nails down that functions are objects and can get passed around as arguments just like any other object, but I don't end up using them that much at work.
I certainly hope those speedups won't be added to older versions. If people want the fastest and best run time available they should run the latest version of the Python language. If they choose to run an older version of Paper it is because they (or perhaps their sysadmin) *strongly* 
An answer: yes. Write more descriptive titles and google before you ask. 
I would expect that, consistent with most other operations in Python, it would be `d1.update(d2)`. 
For this kind of stuff I usually go with [bottle](https://bottlepy.org). Micro framework (in contrast to flask, it’s really micro), Flask-like API, just one file, no dependencies, great performance, extremely well documented, nice and clean codebase.
Just want to read opinions from here lol
Thanks. I'll check out the bottle framework. However, please keep in mind that we want a simple, self contained web server that also acts as the framework and sometimes application for developing, testing, sharing, and delivering server side code. In other words, we seek a simple, trusted wrapper around the code that is important without requiring our customer / reader to come up to speed with a new framework / server that might have BS tracking code embedded in it (e.g., via CDNs, fonts, etc.) . &amp;#x200B;
if gaming is not "y", what doesn't happen?
Map, reduce , pivot, pivot table... I’m not an analyst kind of programmer so those are the only ones I know. You need to think of the common operations as the objective and understand that they’ll be accomplished in a fairly similar manner in python. Think of what you already know in terms of concepts, not syntax or grammar.

Your rank variable does not get set unless the user answers "y" When you answer "n", rank does not get set and then your if statement: If rank == ("10"): gets executed but rank is not set thus the unbound variable.

Very bad syntax. Python is easy to learn. [Here](https://github.com/yoelvisj/py-books) some books. Take any book to begin. A example: def example_two(number_list): # statements on the number_list return your_result example_two([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])
Well, bottle is perfectly suited for that. It’s just about 4.000 loc, it’s something you can fully grasp. It’s very simple, yet powerful. That’s why I prefer it over flask for development.
/r/learnpython def exampleTwo (numList): newList = [] numberOne = numList[-2]+100 #find the second to last number, add 100 numberTwo = numList[-1]+100 #find the last number, add 100 newList.append(numberOne) newList.append(numberTwo) #append the numbers to the blank list return newList exampleTwo(INPUTEDLIST) --- Don't do any operations in the defintion line of a function (where you're doing num1+100, num2+100). You're also taking 4 inputs for the function, where it should only take one (a list). And you're printing instead of using return (this will depend on whatever tool you're using to learn, but generally when it says "return" you actually need to use return

3 fucking spaces?
Thanks for your help. So I would place the list like this? newList = \[2,4,6,8\] &amp;#x200B; And then on exampleTwo at the bottom would I input the complete list again? Sorry for the basic questions Also, Sorry for posting a coding question in the wrong subreddit 
wrote it in reddit, not an IDE 
Also I note that the OP asked for array and you used list. This plus 3 spaces leads me to believe that you trolled OP on purpose, in case OP's plan was to just copy paste into their homework assignment. I approve.
you would do listYouWantToGiveToTheFunction = [2,4,6,8] exampleTwo(listYouWantToGiveToTheFunction) newList only exists inside the function itself. It is used to store the numbers that will be returned at the end of the function
Why you need them on older versions?
It's a general purpose programming language. You can use it to do anything any other GP lang can do, and most of the time you can do it easier, and sometimes better. It has drawbacks, like any language, but these can often be mitigated. It's slower than C/C++ but what isn't? With cx_Freeze (or Nuitka or...) you can be damn fast. For web services? Nothing I've found beats Flask for ease development. Certainly nothing that begins with a "J" ;)
/r/learnpython
I think that’s just because python’s map syntax is garbage. For a language like swift it’s: var.map{abs($0 + 1)} Which is plenty easy to read and also very easy to chain maps and filters etc

 The whole point of new versions is so that improvements can be added in an orderly manner. I’m not sure why anybody familiar with software development would even ask such a question. If you need new features upgrade to the latest Python like everbody else. 
How about ease of deployment? With Java I could do a simple springboot app, compile to a jar and throw it onto any machine and run it and it would work just fine. Or even use Jenkins to auto build from bitbucket. Does python have anything similar?

It's stuff like this that makes libraries incompatible with the new version of Python. Totally fine when I don't think I support it, but a huge problem if I think I do. Please don't. Also, there's no need for Python 2.7. It's in security updates mode only and it's already there.

A for loop would be appropriate. When I am adding a code or whatever to an API key, I do something similar.
So I am not really sure what part of the code to share but I will share the sound files that are interrupting the background music and may be thats the issue. Or there is the whole thing but that is 212 lines and seems excessive to copy over. def fire_bullet(): #Bulletstate as global - changes in function effect every bullet state global bulletstate if bulletstate == "ready": winsound.PlaySound("lazer.wav", winsound.SND_ASYNC) bulletstate = "fire" This is the chunk for when the bullet fires and that stops the back ground music. The code I have been trying for the background music is what is in my original comment.

I'm a newb to docker though if you are having the issue I used to have when being linked to github versions of Dockerfile is that you don't need to build it, you can use it as a dependency I see in [https://hub.docker.com/\_/python/](https://hub.docker.com/_/python/) that there is a tag [3.8.0a2-stretch](https://github.com/docker-library/python/blob/fc2b02ab98f1d24e149758b05273d5f712a8946e/3.8-rc/stretch/Dockerfile) Create a file named Dockerfile with contents FROM python:3.8.0a2-stretch RUN pip install --upgrade pip # COPY *.py /app/ ENTRYPOINT ["/usr/local/bin/python", "--version" Build \`\`\` docker build -t me/test . \`\`\` Run \`\`\` docker run --rm me/test \`\`\` I commented out the COPY command though you would likely want to to copy you application and run it from the entry point.
String concatenation isn't cummulative, so --as I said-- it shouldn't use the `+` operator too. It's a bad design choice imho.

&gt; What if we could define non-symbolic operators? Good. Or we can have a special syntax for calling binary functions as infix operators. def add(a, b): return a + b print(add(1, 2)) print(1 `add` 2) (I'm not suggesting this specific syntax, it's just an example) F# has the inverse functionality, we can use infix operators as functions let x = 1 + 5 let y = (+) 1 5 printfn "Does it work? %b" (x = y) Which I use frequently and I miss a lot in Python.

Old version of Paper. Wasn't that called papyrus?
Yeah, do, but not by following this tutorial: - Don't run flask from inside your script; set the `FLASK_APP` environment variable and run it with `flask run` - Don't create tables and manage the connection to the database manually--that's insane! Use SQLAlchemy (optionally with http://flask-sqlalchemy.pocoo.org/2.3/), define the database model with that and it'll handle the database session for you too - Never, under any circumstances, import unsanitised data into a database, that's beyond insane. https://xkcd.com/327/ - Don't perform manual serialisation and deserialisation, use https://marshmallow.readthedocs.io/en/3.0/ (and the associated marshsmallow-sqlalchemy package) - If you're just creating a load of CRUD statements, then you might want to use [connexion](https://connexion.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) I'm afraid the author of this article is simply not qualified to write about this topic.
It was a nice writeup. I myself struggled to find good articles, and the reasons why we use different files (modules) to write code when we can do it in one file. Awesome work!
I need numpy and scipy for my current project and they are not available for 3.8
I’m afraid there is vote manipulation behind this post, given the amount of comments, the number of upvote and the quality of the content...
Typo? navigator, not naviagtor
The database part is horrific, but I am not sure I completely agree with your other points. I agree that there are good practices that are recommended (such as running the application with flask run, using 3rd party packages for common tasks such as serialization) but the purpose of such tutorial is the introduction to flask, not learning to create a production ready app with the best practices, but satisfy a little curiosity regarding flask. I think learning marshmallow and connexion is a little out of scope for such a basic tutorial targeted at less experienced people.

Do you prefer the light themes? I find they strain my eyes.
Somehow, yes. I’m a hobbyist programmer, I spend at most 1–2 hours a day coding. And, as a copywriter by profession, I’m more used to the “paper-like” black-on-white.
It should be the same list. A bit more context: I’m connecting to a mongo database, fetching 500000 records at a time. This loads the RAM quite a bit as you can imagine, so I need to “free up” already-processed records every once in a while.
If that's your actual ApiKey, I would recommend editing it out of the post and not posting them online my dude!

Why are people downvoting you? WTF? I can't say I'm a fan of the project, but that's a case for discussion, not downvotes.
If they put it back to older versions, no one would switch to the new version.
I'd probably do the deduping in getmsg.py. Store the key when you push the record, check for an existing key before you push. So duplicates never get pushed.
Will give this a shot, thanks for the all the help
I completely agree with you. List comprehensions can be easier to read. However, the ``map`` requires a callable. The question here is whether it is an issue of using map or comprehensions more than whether lambda functions makes more readable code. I am completely not sure about this, but sometimes it feels Python tried to borrow syntax from some other languages and since adoption was not that spread, some tools ended up half-baked (such as ``map``). Having a separate ``def`` makes reusable code, you have docstrings, etc. I discuss this on the tutorial. However, sometimes you don't need all that. You just want to log that a user pressed a button. Is it worth developing an extra method (which, if you ever remove the log will end up being an orphan)?. In the end, it all comes down to knowing your tools and deciding when to choose one or the other. The fact that it is available doesn't mean you have to use it everywhere... 
If they become hard to read later on the life of the project, you can always move the lambda to its own definition and refactor the code. However, it may very well happen that the special part of the code doesn't change for ages and a lambda functions is all what you need. It's a matter of developing code with more than functionality in mind. 
🤦 Oops. Voice recognition error.
Once you hit a thousand lines-of-code, you'll know why it was a good idea to split the project in multiple files. Even if it's only because you have to work at three places at once.
Thank you very much for this hint. This looks good.
Does it work with nested lamdbas? (You probably should avoid nested lambdas if you care about readability at all, but, well ...)
I’m not entirely sure what you mean by nested lambdas, but you can certainly make anonymous functions within anonymous functions. If you give me an example in python (or just describe what you want) I can probably give you the corresponding swift code. 
Something like: sub_or_add = lambda left, sub=False: (lambda right: left - right) if sub (lambda right: left + right)
At the beginning of the [time documentation](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/time.html) there’s a bullet list of terminology and conventions. The last bullet point lays out how to convert between struct_time and epoch timestamps depending on whether you want/have a struct_time in UTC or localtime. tl:dr You want calendar.timegm() 
Tbh working with those sounds terrible but yeah you can do that same thing in swift, I think you would just have to explicitly typecast everything since the language is statically typed. let sub_or_add: (Int, Bool) -&gt; ((Int)-&gt;(Int)) = {(left, sub) in sub ? {right in left-right} : {right in left+right} }
Uhh, what. Can you be more specific?
Absolutely perfect! `import datetime` `import calendar` `start = calendar.timegm(datetime.datetime(2019, 1, 18, 8, 31, 0).timetuple())` = 1547800260 `end = calendar.timegm(datetime.datetime(2019, 1, 18, 8, 32, 0).timetuple())` = 1547800320 Now to see if there's any easy way to take in an ISO8601 formatted date string instead of having to plug values into the code above..
Hi! When you say "data" do you mean raw data or also variable name and values, code etc. ? For raw data, would just storing hashes do? We also provide on-side deployment, send us an email to [hej@amie.ai](mailto:hej@amie.ai) and we can talk about it. 
Can I maybe ask in a bit more detail, 1. Why do you want to have it open source? Is it because you want to contribute, use it for your own projects, or check the code? 2. Why do you want to run it locally? It's also possible to have a sustainable product open source and free for (most) users, but it's really tricky to have a multi-user web-app running locally with potentially different versions... &amp;#x200B;
That makes perfect sense, since Python 3.8 is not available either! Right now you can get Python 3.8a1. "a1" means "the first alpha release". You should not be using an alpha release for your current project. Alpha versions are basically _certain_ to have bugs in them. That's why we go through alphas, betas and finally release versions. The planned release date for 3.8 is in late October, and there's always some reasonable likelihood of it being later than that, though Python has done well with meeting its development timetables. You're just looking for trouble, and wasting our time and yours, if you use 3.8 before its official release.
If you want to have multiple versions of working python on a system you can use any version of python (say 3.7.2) and create a virtual environment for the other version using this one. I don't know about using Anaconda in that environment.
No-no, I just need the latest version, I want to get rid of all the older 
It's possible that the other versions are required by the system or other programms
Who?
[removed]
Maybe then python 3.6.8 is a better stable variant. Or you can go for the latest. 3.6.8 is supported by every platform like (Tensorflow etc.)
It's generally discouraged to use the "system Python". Just create a venv and you're golden
pytest? flask?
There are many programming language which we can use for Data Science like Java, Python , Java script which provides its own specification . In some case we prefer Python then in some condition we prefer java . When we compare in all regards, i personally think Python is the best programming language for the [Field of Data Science](http://pythonandmltrainingcourses.com/courses/best-data-science-training-in-delhi/). There are many specification which Python provides but cant be acquire with other Programming language. * Python is a easy language to learn which is beneficial for the beginners. * It provides many library which is always a plus point for making a project in Data Science. * It is interpreted Programming language. Because of this features it makes python little bit slower but is beneficial in many other way. * Python is very flexible programming language and we can save lots of time by using Python instead of other language. * It is well structured and readable programming language. For knowing in details about the importance of Python in Data Science you can refer to this [Quora Answer](https://www.quora.com/Why-should-I-learn-Python-instead-of-Java/answer/Raj-Shivakoti)

I solved it hurray. So my .condarc file had https proxy listed and I was at my home where there's open internet. That's why the error was recurring. Now I just went to the r/learnpython FAQ and while reading through it hit me. Thanks nonetheless.

...what.
Given all of the problems mentioned here, can someone please recommend a URL to a *Build Your 1st Python Web App With Flask* that is actually good?
Why api methods are in camelCase?
Try pyenv
By definition, Tauthon isn't Python, so in a strict sense, it's off-topic here. 
This is the one I follow :D [https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world)
Using `map` instead of a comprehension makes it more uniform with other similar statements, especially when code gets a bit more complex then just a single isolated example statement.
?
I don’t need to filter anything in the query. Perhaps I mis-explained. Here’s the deal: There’s in total 20,000,000 records in the database. I need to process them sequentially, grabbing \~100,000 records at a time. 20e6 records don’t fit in my RAM, so I’m loading them in batches of 500,000. Once I’ve done with the first batch, I need to load 500,000 records more, while deleting the first \~400,000 from the first batch to free up the memory. And so on.
So I was able to reboot the server (python app) the other day and it came back up. I let it run over the weekend to come in on Monday and see that it is doing the same thing. Messages send, but nothing was broadcast back. Also fun, I got a bunch of bots that connected. Not sure what they were sending, but I have a lot of traceback errors in various threads for unicode decode errors.
This is basically the official flask tutorial at this point.
Numpy &amp; scipy should make 3.8 compatible releases soon after 3.8 is actually released. 
Wow your first project is better than many first timers peojects. Thats great. I guess you already know a lot.
*John Bura*
How did you add the emphasis on \*\*strongly\*\* using voice recognition?
I still don't see a need to be doing this filtering in Python. You should read up on the SQL `LIMIT` and `OFFSET` expression (e.g. [in Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/queries-limit.html)). Run `cur.execte()` with `LIMIT 100000`, store the results, process them, delete them, run `cur.execute()` again this time with `LIMIT 100000 OFFSET 100000`.
How about the official website? It literally has "your first web app with Flask" on its first page. And another one in the tutorial in the docs.
Pyhton used to backport new features into old interpreters so they set a precedent. They should never have done that.

- 4. Posting garbage to this sub And it's too common at that!
I worked so much on it, and learned a lot of things along the way. Thank you so much!
I don’t need to limit any newly loaded results. I need to filter out those that were already loaded the last time (and already processed). Basically what I am doing on the database side is exactly like you said (limit + offset), only that I’ll still need to filter out those results *after* I’ve processed them. &amp;#x200B; In other words: &gt;store the results, process them, delete them is exactly what I’m doing. (Only that I can’t delete them all, need to save a few of them to be appended with the newly loaded ones.) &amp;#x200B; From yet another perspective. Imagine, I have digits 123456789ABCDEFGH My algorithm assumes that I work on 6 digits at a time (e.g., 123456, 56789A, 89ABCD, etc.). Also, due to technical limitations, I can only load 8 digits at a time. So I make the first “SQL query” and load 12345678 Then I do my processing: 123456, 234567, 345678 Now, at that point, I need to load more digits (to process 45678**9**). I don’t want to load them one by one, because that would mean that I would need to load one digit with every next algorithm step. Instead, I “delete” digits 123 from the memory (which is what original code does). Then my stored list becomes 45678 To which I add another 8 digits: 9ABCDEFG Now I have a list of 456789ABCDEFG And I start working sequentially on 456789, 56789A, 6789AB, and so on. When I reach BCDEFG, I will run the database query once again, to load 8 more symbols. &amp;#x200B;
How much, if any, is made with web assembly?
Whoever that is.
Wow, this is neat!
I’ve saved these points as I was going to try this guide a little bit later. Thank you very much 
You have to disconnect from the [VoiceClient](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#discord.VoiceClient) that `.join_voice_channel(channel)` returns. So do something like `voice_client = client.join_voice_channel(channel)`, then `voice_client.disconnect()` &amp;#x200B; [https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py/issues/1399](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py/issues/1399) 
&gt; By definition, Tauthon isn't Python, so in a strict sense, it's off-topic here. No, that's not it. People don't downvote PyPy news: https://old.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/apfvem/pypy_v700_triple_release_of_27_35_and_36alpha/
Didn't find a way how to do the same with the classes. Every time I add a route to a method, FastAPI just hangs.
&gt; Why are people downvoting you? WTF? Beginners are more likely to treat programming languages like football clubs and languages that are easy to learn attract more beginners. They probably see forks (or anything not blessed by upstream) as personal attacks.
I use voice recognition to enter the text, then edit that by hand with the keyboard. But I obviously missed one instance of "Python" =&gt; "Paper".
Does anyone know how to download python without going through User account control
Probably. I saw that exact stance in those weirdly ardent Python 2 supporters back in the day, I’m sad to see that it’s colored off to people here.
Agreed. The create method of the ToDoModel class is a classic example of what \_not\_ to do. Database code like this is close to guaranteed to being hacked. 
PyPy is an implementation of Python, Tauthon is an implementation of something that explicitly isn't. It's splitting hairs for sure, but still true in the strictest sense.
/r/Python/comments/b0jmzx/top\_5\_python\_frameworks\_for\_test\_automation\_in/
&gt; PyPy is an implementation of Python Not exactly. PyPy is implementing a subset of Python2 or Python3. &gt; Tauthon is an implementation of something that explicitly isn't Tauthon implements a superset of Python2. Of the two, Tauthon will run more Python2 programs than PyPy2.7.

I'd try something with turtle (search for python turtle) It's only 2d graphic but it will help you grasp basic concepts of python programing. It's a great way to start and you immediately see the results. Thanks to being 2d graphics it might be huge plus for you. Good luck!

When you ask this over in r/learnpython, be sure to tell them what you've tried so far and why it didn't work.
You should look up regular expressions. They are confusing, but super helpful. Alternatively you could write a loop that goes through matching letter by letter until it finds something that doesn't match the next expected letter, and resets the expected letter index
He makes it sound like someone is coming after him. What’s all this about?
You have several options for how to implement this. You can use the public API to get data if it is available. Here is a sample list of API for developers: [https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis](https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis) Some popular services have examples of client libraries. [https://openweathermap.org/examples#python](https://openweathermap.org/examples#python) Look for examples on GitHub and on [https://pypi.org](https://pypi.org), maybe someone already did this. Another option is web scraping. But the legality of web scraping varies around the world. 
Other than the Mayan EDMS copyright problem [this](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9973598) is the only thing i could find about him.
Thank you this seems very helpful! I have another idea, too, maybe you could help. I haven't done any research yet because I just came up with the idea last night. I'd like to make a library of guitar chords and have an app that allows you to search for the chords by typing out the name of the chord or maybe creating the fingering on a fretboard.
Have you checked the "Bigger Applications" section? [https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/bigger-applications/](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/bigger-applications/) &amp;#x200B; You can separate in Python modules/files with that.
Is this Shazam for guitarists? :)
Thanks for the advice!
I won't link or give the people who did this a platform, but he was tagged by a prominent SJW as a "harasser" and has been blacklisted in the community for the crime of following the wrong people on twitter. The blacklist has hurt his career and specifically prohibited from speaking at some conferences. He has withdrawn from the community and no longer talks about it, probably out of fear of making it worse ( again ).
Why did I imagine that with no information? This crap has to stop.
Judging from the fact that it's for school, I suspect something like the latter is what they're expecting from the students (though I'd probably use slices instead of a character-by-character comparison). I'm my experience, treating strings as arrays/lists comes way before regex in intro to programming classes.
Maybe, what is Shazam? lol
That's really fucked up, but doesn't surprise me.
this is why one should always make every effort to be incognito 
You probably want to be careful here. Unless you can be sure they aren't being used by something, it's probably best to ignore the old versions. Sounds like you're defaulting to the version you want, so unless the older versions are causing you some trouble or eating up too much disk space, you're probably just creating work for yourself needlessly. Also, make sure you don't delete 2.7. MacOS relies on that for some internal stuff, iirc. 
Authoritarian left at its best.
I wouldn't really know, but the fact that people got so obsessed about him points to mental issues.
I applaud the efforts, even if I haven't a use for this. So here's my up vote.

/r/pythontips would be my recommendation. 
marshmallow at least as it pertains to json\_api stuff was terribly slow(fan out on relationships even when you're not including them), i replaced it with 150 lines of code that does exactly what I need it to do, it's not hard. also, having to specify types for attributes and cardinality for relationships reminded me of configuring hibernate/java back in the bad old days. use marshmallow for validation maybe, but I dont see it being useful beyond that. 
yep, there's flask upvote bots.

You could probably download the 3.7 version and just change the 7 to an 8 and it could work.
For me its been the same as already mentioned, automating a webpage, making own little games, interacting with physical devices such as sensors on a raspberry pi or an Amazon echo. Things I wanted to achieve. end up learning a whole lot more than python along the way also!
Python and Jupyter notebook tutorials are available too.

PSF is also pretty bad. Don't know if he's a member but I stopped following email lists a long time ago.
That's the most pathetic attempt at link farm building I've yet to see. How much did that online gambling site pay you for ripping off some other beginner resource to create this abomination? 
What's wrong with PSF? I've never been following mailing lists. What happened?

You should ask about this in /r/Atom, not /r/learnpython.
Good advice: switch to Visual Studio Code. I abandoned Atom some months ago and I'm not going back. Everuthing is so unfinished and slow there. VS Code has everything you need for Python development, just install the official Python extension. Regarding your question: did you run this command to install python-language-server? Did you read Install Instructions? Also, /r/learnpython in the future.
Forgive my ignorance but what’s going on at these events? Talking about a little more than python and Django? 
indentation :) 
I went down an absolute rabbit hole and it looks like he was right. Im guessing the delation was because he was getting abused for the choice of words..
Man, it really speaks to the disaster of the python 2/3 situation that a member of the community would consider this a valid question. 
Anyone got a list of his projects somewhere?
I meant PSF internal mailing list (I am a member), but the amount of drama and internal fighting, specially after the debacle of the dongle joke was extremely high for my liking.
Authoritarians will eventually come for you, being incognito isn't going to solve the problem.
Yeah, here have been times where I deleted a comment or tweet after posting it because I couldn't be arsed to deal with drama from keyboard warriors.
How should I know? I stopped going after donglegate. 
Yeah I know! Frankly that stupidity is, in part, what held up version 3 adoption. I can not think of any project anywhere that benefitted from submitting to whinny users that didn’t want to upgrade. It is even more perplexing for somebody to ask about back porting if they are already using a 3.X series of Python. Simply asking the question seems to be very odd in this case. 
Sure! Thanks!
Oh I mean going on as far as what’s not making you want to go. I’m curious as to what’s going on in the community
I have no idea what a link farm is. I wrote every one of these tutorials myself. I have the jupyter notebooks to prove it. It took me 4 weeks of my spare time to write these. This is a basic Wordpress site. I have AdSense on it hoping to recover the hosting costs alone. An abomination? Wow. It was an honest effort. 
Although I am sympathetic to the guy and thankful for his many copy-left projects which may live well beyond his involvement, I can't shake off that if he really wished the best for the community, he would have shed some light on what these problems are. I don't mean calling anyone out by their names (which he pretty much does regardless) but saying a few words on "this is where I think the community has to move away from and towards what". Instead, it kinda feels like "I'm not happy so you don't get to play with my toys anymore, I'm out". Once again, I'm much more thankful for his contributions than anything else and fully appreciate the fact that he is hurting and maybe not thinking straight at the moment but all I'm trying to say is that there could have been a more constructive way of handling his "final commit' rather than pointing fingers aimlessly and saying "conferences aren't even about the tech anymore", which doesn't really mean anything nor helps anyone in power to fix things. Or maybe I'm just out of the loop, as many here in the comments seem to be as well (and Google too). However, I think my point of view without any prior knowledge is as valid as anyone else's when seeing an open message like this.
Sometimes they want to upgrade, but can't. Security fixes are backported regularly because it's not often easy or cheap to upgrade. I don't think it's unreasonable to ask about a backport. 
IMO, you should look into [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv). It's a tool that manages python versions for you. So you don't have a couple folders of python out there. You just have projects, and then pyenv can shim the version of python in place for you. Also, never delete the OSX version of python, nor upgrade it, or change it. You let Apple handle the version of that one.

nice little vid, i subscribed cos i'm pretty new with Python!
r/learnpython would be the correct subreddit for seeking help. Also there is a [Discord server](https://discord.gg/discord-api) specifically for interacting with the Discord API and making bots.
Another really awesome one is [black](https://github.com/ambv/black), which I absolutely love. It's dead simple, requires no configuration, and super easy to integrate into most environments.

**Cybersquatting** Cybersquatting (also known as domain squatting), according to the United States federal law known as the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act, is registering, trafficking in, or using an Internet domain name with bad faith intent to profit from the goodwill of a trademark belonging to someone else. The cybersquatter then offers to sell the domain to the person or company who owns a trademark contained within the name at an inflated price. The term is derived from "squatting", which is the act of occupying an abandoned or unoccupied space or building that the squatter does not own, rent, or otherwise have permission to use. *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Python/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28

&gt; Forgive my ignorance but what’s going on at these events? At EuroPython 2012, in Florence, Guido wearing a T-shirt saying "Python is for girls" was blocking an exit before a "women in Python" keynote. Fortunately, there were other exists available ;-)
Yeah, ML/AI is a tool and like any tool can be used for good or evil. But given what I've seen of human nature and how entropy makes it easier to destroy than to create, I found myself dealing with cognitive dissonance working in the field, and that kind of stress is bad. At least nuclear weapons have a high threshold for use. Meh, I can't predict the future, maybe it'll be fine. I agree with you about not stagnating, but I think I have to not stagnate elsewhere than ML/AI. No, I don't think my infinitesimal contribution makes any difference, it's its effect on me that was the problem.
I you have python installed, just right click on any .py file and press Edit with IDLE

This is, I believe, the de facto tutorial for flask. Great content and discussion. 
I would suggest a good book to learn python, personally. Some books are going to be better than others, obviously, but get a book, and follow it beginning to end, even through the parts that can be more boring, tedious, or frustrating. That being said, codeacademy is a good website, and hackerrank is another good one
Still, the link gets an insane number of up votes... Is people really reading before deciding whether it is a worthy tutorial? It's not the first time I see stuff like this. There was a video of someone recommending a ``sudo python`` to run Django... 
Which is preferred: Way 1: string = '' if number_items == 1 else 's' Way 2: if number_items == 1: string = '' else: string = 's' Way 1 seems pretty non-pythonic, a little weird and less readable. What do you guys think?
Sure thing. I started off watching this guy's channel and it was a great way to get started. https://www.youtube.com/user/sentdex

Well... keep in mind: These are just your thoughts. Your thoughts are not reality. Reality is outside of your thoughts. There is a reality out there you can't even conceive of. Don't get too tied up believing that you understand reality or the future. "If you are pained by external things, it is not they that disturb you, but your own judgement of them. And it is in your power to wipe out that judgement now. If you are pained by any external thing, it is not this thing that disturbs you, but your own judgment about it." -- Marcus Aurelius He's saying "Dude, you're freaked out by your own thought. Not the actual thing. The actual thing is probably very different from your thought."

Heck, some of Reddit PostgreSQL folks were upset when a moderator made a tweet that said that people should not be drinking alcoholic beverages while giving presentations at its conference. :-( There are a lot of people like Linus Torvalds in tech that don't know how to behave like an adult.
&gt; nothorious divulgator ... what?
From my cursory reading (and searching on Google), it appears that his decision to shut down his projects are due to a long-standing drama between him (and others) and "social justice warriors" who had worked in 2015 to sign into open source and programming" circles and spread the message of "inclusion." Evidently, there is a heated (and now more reasonably hushed) argument about quality control versus code from a person-of-colour or non-binary contributor, and the nuance was lost in the heat of the moment. It became a "*f\*\*\*-fest*" of whose voices became stronger. As a result, a lot of major and leading contributors to open source programming software and projects quit. Understandably, the long harassments from SJWs to force him off from his involvement in major Python and Django-related projects had worked. I proffer no intention to side with either sides of the culture wars — where I came from, "those are Western belief systems" —. I shall provide context with links below on the ensuing drama (with his name on) but I cannot offer a direct causation as to the primary reason for Roberto's departure, only the circumstances that *may* led to his announcement to abandon Python and his other projects save for Mayan EDMS.

Oh, I'm aware. I have no interest in any trademarks - I'm a registrar for .uk domains, and I pretty regularly see domains on the droplist that I'm interested in snagging for various purposes. Existing dropcatch scripts tend to be closely guarded and/or very expensive. Online services exist to try and catch drops for a price, but those registrars only get the same number of queries as I get, and they're sharing that quota among however many domains they have on their list that day. I usually only want one domain, so I figured I probably stand a reasonable chance of winning if I have my own script on a decent server. Also, I wanted to have a decent script in place for when .uk Right of Registration expires on 19th June - I have a good list of domains that I want to try and pick up when they become available.

I often go to his videos for different topics in python, I enjoy all of them. Easily the most thorough and easy to follow from the channels I’ve seen. 
Yeah, I just was curious what the comment said, but wanted to give some disclaimer about a user-deleted comment as there could be other reasons for the deleted repos (e.g. health, time in lieu of other family or work commitments, mental health, etc.). I personally don't know the story and while my personal politics are progressive, I do think SJW harassment is a problem sometimes. Conservative and liberal viewpoints are fine and will only have a problem when people become directly uncivil and harassing. (And having differing opinions is not necessarily uncivil.)
So if you anly have one unknown why not just solve the equation.
It's not really "all different levels" is it. I saw zero junior-level positions. I mean that's fine if that's what it is, but it should be billed that way.
Imho the case is that SJW started a witch hunt on anyone who disagrees with them and are attempting to censor, harass and doxx for as much as making a joke. Liberal values of tolerance and openness got really regressed. Sad world we live in.

but you have a linear equation. Just take the values from the beginning and you t for C=0 and plot them.

Aren't electron apps a massive resource hog?

Lol
And clunkiness? When I tried it out it felt like a novelty that was a resource hog (took a minute to do a operation that took a fraction of a second when rewritten in JS)

what do you mean? I am looking for a python tutorial site/book/video/etc. for a school project
Well, if you need any help, I'd be happy to contribute. Sounds like an interesting idea. 
There are a lot of people who post learnpython-y questions here because they're ignorant of that subreddit. But you are aware of it, and aware that questions relating to learning python are welcome there and not welcome here. Your question could \*feasibly\* have been about something more appropriate for this sub than that one, but no, it's literally just "I need to learn python". What on earth made you think that that wasn't a question more appropriate for a sub \*literally called\* learnpython?
Is there a reason why you are holding on to a old PC? I've seen used $100 PC's that have better specs. 
My personal choice is Aiohttp it has lots support libraries such aiohttp_session and aiohttp_security and an admin package. These can make really quite easy to develop using the framework. 
fair point, i did post it on learn python too, i'll take this down

I knew the name sounded familiar. This is the "Code of Merit" guy. Him no longer being involved with software development is probably best for everybody.
(I am the Quart &amp; Hypercorn author and a contributor to ASGI, so consider me biased). I would rule out Growler as it seems to be unmaintained (last commit in 2017). I would also rule out Vibora in its current form (doesn't work with Python 3.7 and hasn't seen updates since July last year). Hopefully a Vibora rewrite will be released soon. Also note Japronto is ruled out as it is in maintenance mode. Considering performance next, AIOHTTP, Sanic, Quart+Uvicorn, Starlette+Uvicorn, FastAPI+Uvicorn all use httptools and uvloop which is the secret sauce for performance, other than writing in C like japronto or Cython like Vibora. In my tests AIOHTTP, Sanic, Starlette+Uvicorn, FastAPI+Uvicorn are all roughly the same. Quart+Uvicorn is a little slower as it follows Flask and sets up contexts. I personally think ASGI is great and the best successor to WSGI. Choosing ASGI will allow you to change the ASGI server without changing your framework. This means you could use X+Hypercorn to serve HTTP/2 or X+Daphne to use a very stable server used by the Django community. I'd therefore rule out AIOHTPP and Sanic. (For now Sanic is working on ASGI). The choice between the remaining Quart, Starlette, and FastAPI is then probably one of taste. They are all Flask inspired (although Quart has the Flask API). I think they all roughly similar in terms of ease of use, scalability and flexibility. Starlette probably has the biggest community though and the best middleware. However, I'd rule them all out as they are all based on asyncio. In my view Trio has a much clearer and cleaner API, although it isn't as performant as asyncio+uvloop. This is the Python tradeoff though - developer time against performance. So I'd recommend QuartTrio + Hypercorn[trio] (where Hypercorn runs the Trio worker rather than asyncio). 
Compared to what? PyCharm? No. Also, who cares? He wants an IDE, not an editor, so there goes n++, VSC is free, and relatively lightweight, with fantastic Python support. Sorry that it says MS on it but it took it about an hour to fire Sublime Text for me after Sublime for years and years.
notable publisher; why they chose to use a term even dictionary.com considers archaic who knows.
Version 1 is more Pythonic. The readability is a call that you make based on your assessment of the set of people that you think will read the code.
Huh. I googled the term and it only lead back here, for me.
ITT people still throwing around bad faith strawmen like 'SJW' as if it isn't a bogey man used to defend bad behavior.
Panda3D might actually be the best 3D engine for Python. Unfortunately, Python's ecosystem isn't really well equipped for 3D application development.
I... what? When did I say \*anything\* about microsoft? OP specifically asked for something which can run on a POS machine and electron apps notoriously take MUCH more memory than they should do for any given feature set. I'm fully aware that VSC is a great IDE, but when OP is asking for a low-memory option, offering something electron-based seems questionable.

My assumption is that nothorious is a typo for notorious.
Hi, everyone. Here is the github link to the source code: https://github.com/ArchieJude/fetch.git 
My apologies - many people automatically ding VSC because it's an MS product. But seriously - if what you're doing is coding, why not dedicate your machine's resources **to that**? 
Yes. 
Could you send the code 
Only skimmed it, but seems very nice and easily understandable. Will bookmark it for whenever I need to write a graphical application :)
First r/learnpython would be the right place. But I think without even trying or explaining your approach to it you won’t get any help. At least try... 
How much were you serializing? That fan out problem seems like a straight up bug. 
[Source Code](https://github.com/lukeclopez/PyBallProtector) [EXE Download Page](https://github.com/lukeclopez/PyBallProtector/releases) You could probably overhaul this to be a full-blown reminder app. Maybe I'll do that one day.
The worst part about being smart is you often have ideas that show others are wrong. The worst part about being radical is you often stand alone in a community. When something you have poured you heart into, attacks you because of sincerity of spirit, you question values. The OSS can only exist if we address hate speech as a community. So yes, it's sad this person is not more clear but it's more sad and more commonplace that communities allow this silencing of spirits. As the world learns concensus, majority rule will continue to destroy value. Open Source. Open Science. Open knowledge. "My mind is open"... when I find myself in any community not upholdant to rhis, I leave, like a victorous King or atleast that's my Buddha speaking...

Reverse engineering... Basically understanding the capabilities or changing the behaviour of compiled binaries.
What exactly would one reverse engineer?
[it was](https://github.com/marshmallow-code/marshmallow-jsonapi/issues/34#issuecomment-390426960)
This, and it can be combined with Docker… [https://github.com/jhermann/dockyard/blob/master/biopy3/Dockerfile.pyenv](https://github.com/jhermann/dockyard/blob/master/biopy3/Dockerfile.pyenv)
written in python
Reverse engineering can be done for good or evil. For example, people do it to understand how malware in the wild work, to find exploitable vulnerabilities or to crack paid software. Sometimes you also have to dig into this level to debug software (specially when its code is not available).
Just to clarify: It sends the notification seen in the video every 20 minutes.
I second that! Anyone here can give you two lines of code to solve it. But as others have commented, its better that you try it first... Write a foor loop and few lines of if else statement. Goodluck ;)
Thanks!
Do your own homework
Personally I think SJW shouldn't be used because it's pejorative and hurts discourse. People should fight for social justice. From what I've seen however He's being picked on unfairly based on some kind of unsubstantiated opinion.
Use pyenv. Then it becomes as easy as `pyenv install 3.8-dev` - it gets installed to your userspace with zero impact on your system python, and you can make virtualenvs based on it (`pyenv virtualenv 3.8-dev my-env`) which automatically activate when you `cd` to particular directories (`pyenv local my-env`).
Good, clean tutorial. I like it.
Guido: &gt;Once you've internalized the simple properties which operators tend to have, using `+` for string or list concatenation becomes more readable than a pure OO notation, and (2) and (3) above explain (in part) why that is. Larry: &gt;But it contradicts property (1). That's (in part) why I did *not* use `+` for string and list concatenation in Perls. Then again I used it for adding floats, even though that contradicts property (1) too. And changed my mind about what symbol to use between Perl 5 and Perl 6. Heck, who cares about consistency? Guido: &gt;I care. I consistently hate on Perl and Python users consistently love me doing so.
You don't need an IDE as a beginner. IDLE, maybe. Someone else said it: Notepad++ is all you need to get started. Open Notepad++ on one side of your screen and open the command line (cmd.exe) on the other side. Write your code and save it. Alt-Tab to the command line window and run your program. There's no real reason to run code from within your editor. Using PyCharm to learn Python is like learning to drive in an 18-wheeler! &amp;#x200B;
What makes you say that? I'm curious
You probably should check how to do that with an inline painless script.
The only way faster than selenium is to reverse engineer the store's APIs and reconstruct the api for its cart. People would usually do this using the android app of a store.

I know nothing much about him personally but I did take the time to read the thread [posted above](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9973598). Which centers around being angry because he got added to the ggautoblocker list on twitter. Which is a list you can be removed from, but it requires demonstrating you didn't side with the shitheels in gamergate. He seems to have failed to do that.
For basic types, it's probably possible enough, but anything more complicated would be tough. The preferred strategy would be using type annotations and mypy so that you know what type it is when you build it.
He got way, way too obsessed with attacking codes of conduct.
perhaps you're looking for something like [prettyprinter](https://pypi.org/project/prettyprinter/)
It's not good for him either. The problem with him just leaving without providing a more detailed statement on this is that everyone has to just fill in the blanks on their own. And they may not be assuming the correct reasons.
Thanks. I went with version 1. I don't think I've seen it before, but I like how concise it is.

You might able to make something out MicroPython or somehow use and abuse AndroidWear device to run python.
Well done! I really indeed encourage you to do stuff with databases involved... it introduces a lot more headache usually. &amp;#x200B; Some ideas: &amp;#x200B; \- Try to think of some tool that can help you make other tools faster \- Cryptocurrency trading (don't use a significant amount of money). I just figured you'd enjoy building such a system as it has everything you mentioned. \- Join some competition like Kaggle and develop data science skills along with it \- Join some competition like codingame... programming AI is fun: it's a great way to learn more and the competition elements pushes you further \- Create a content management system \- You can also try to do stuff with zeromq if you're looking for more trouble \- Create some game in Python \- Learn and become competent in a lower level language &amp;#x200B; I'm just listing the stuff I have done :) But hopefully it inspired you.
Firstly, thank you so much for your response! I live crypto currency and have done a lot of mining related work too! I used to have 4 x 6 GPU rigs! I was wonder g if you had a suggestion for the first point about making a tool that helps make other tools faster. In terms of the AI and Data Scidnce do you think that is something with enough resources I would manage to conquer? 
Googling just Panda3D pulled up about 6 getting started tutorials.
The first one is really a personal one... just look at problems you've solved and consider whether they can be generalized and open sourced :) &amp;#x200B; As for whether you'll be capable: I'm sure of it as I only started programming at the age of 24 ;) I've done all those things and many more in the last 5 years.
Thank you so much!

God I hate that Windows alert noise.
Very cool. Does it detect when you're afk?
I don't think any toxic culture lives for very long. It's a self-solving problem, in the long run. It may take a little while but the Truth has a habit of prevailing.

Good God. PC gone mad
Except Zed Shaw already did exactly what you proposed when he left Mongrel and it didn't change the community much (except force people off the platform).
people will misassume even if you come right out and say it. Find the most recent archive of "Rails is a ghetto" and you'll probably find 80% commonality with Django.
This makes me sad. I’ve learned a lot from his talks and his code. It saddens me that he was targeted in such a way that it has ruined his passion and career. I can’t imagine being in that position.
What are the implications for people who use Django?
Does the 20 feet thing actually work I get eye blur constantly 
Forgot to reply. This worked perfectly thank you.
 According to [this article](https://www.healthline.com/health/eye-health/20-20-20-rule#research): &gt;Taking frequent breaks to look at faraway objects during screen time significantly lessened their eye strain symptoms. In other words, the 20-20-20 rule works. &gt; &gt;While many doctors suggest the 20-20-20 rule is a best line of defense, researchers explain that any break from repetitive computer work or screens is beneficial. &amp;#x200B; The 20-20-20 rule means taking a 20-second break every 20 minutes by staring at something 20 feet away. &amp;#x200B;
Looking at the author's name he must be Italian, like me. In Italian divulgatore Is a very common word, that's why he chose it. It doesn't just mean notable publisher, it means a notable publisher who explain technical/scientific concepts to a wider public. 
english is also not his first language, and gamergate was almost entirely an exclusively english-centric controversy that started in the US so I'm not sure what kind of extra mental energy expenditure made sense for him to engage gg at all, other than to say "I have zero connection to the games industry, I have no idea what gamergate is about and I don't have the time or energy to spend to find out every single translatable and non-translatable nuance in order to grok it enough to "pick a side"". It is sad and disconcerting to see that someone who is trying to keep things completely meritocratic (perhaps the days where lack of technology meant removing an opportunity to assume cultural differences through visual identity tainted communities less - either you had great ideas or not and were judged solely on such) had to be dragged into discussions about gg.
Here is another one: &gt; PAGE is a drag-and-drop GUI generator for Python and Tkinter which generates Python modules which display a relatively simple GUI constructed from Tk and ttk widget sets using the Place Geometry Manager. PAGE is a cross platform tool runing on any OS which has Tcl/Tk installed. PAGE output requires only Python and Tkinter and runs on Linux, Unix, Windows, OS X, and even Rasperian. &gt; &gt; https://sourceforge.net/projects/page/
This also assumes the meritocracy isn't inherently a lie, which is very much has been for the tech industry for much of the last 30+ years.
Good to know, thanks for the heads up!
I'm using http://slgobinath.github.io/SafeEyes/ . Does similar thing.
I haven't used Panda3D, but why are you looking for other online tutorials when the official [docs](https://www.panda3d.org/manual/) already exist, they look fairly well-written? Python is a high level language, meaning that for something as intensive as 3D games, most engines will choose something with better performance (c++, rust, c#, etc.) so I don't think you'll find too many alternatives. If you are really set on Python, I would look into something like IronPython and use it with a C# engine like Unity. 
Is CPU a bottleneck on Node? Seems like this is most likely an IO bound operation. You can use multithreading in both Python and Node for that.
On windows, there's an easier way https://stackoverflow.com/a/912223
We can not help without the code. 
I completely share this sentement. However, a lot of people on this sub are relatively new to coding and learning. For them developing something like that is a good learning experience. You shouldn't be too critical about bloat in these cases. 
Here I was thinking this was an package for openCV. Either way, good tool!
I don't think OP is suggesting that they want to continue to maintain this and make it a reminder app that also does eye breaks, just that the code for the reminding part could be reused for a reminder app if you wanted to make one.
The worst noise is the bell in Powershell if you try to do something that isn't allowed or you already completed and submitted again... And to turn it off is a damn process, and it didn't even save.
It is/was less of a lie compared to just about every other industry, especially during the early/text-only internet years. Why do you think the internet supports so many subcultures and helped bring them to the mainstream? The internet provided the first large-scale safe spaces for people because with an anonymizing handle nobody would treat you differently since they didn't know you were LGBTQ, a POC or differently-abled. Your value was meritocratic, and if you chose to come out, again, for the better part until social media, your merit was still the primary valuation on "the 'net". You're probably thinking of startup culture, which definitely is much more about appearances than anything else, since ultimately it was about making money. When your business model is maximizing advertising, you're going to only tolerate the majority in-group and their preferences.
I use linux at home. So any Windows sound makes me think of work. Fuck you Bill Gates!!!
Did you really just call him a "shitheel"?

Some places do a lot of testing of even minor version upgrades but still want security or performance patches.
Is there any reason you are providing support for Python &lt; 3.6? I think you stand to benefit from things like f-strings if no one requiring your package is using anything below 3.6.
and said he had failed to prove he wasn't one. Don't be cute, you called him a shitheel.
Is there a standard way to make http(s) requests from starlette like you can from aiohttp? Been looking through the documentation and examples without finding examples. 
That is so absurd...
cool stuff. keep it up! 
No as has been noted elsewhere its more baffling that he got involved at all. If he is a gator. Then yeah. He's a shitheel. 
I don't think there's a benefit of f-strings currently... I've used \`.format\` 2 times in total in the library. f-strings in my opinion is nice and in some cases I choose to use it, but I feel this kind of utility should not be exclusive from the beginning. 
That's a rediculously rose colored view of the computing in the 80s and 90s. And even outside startup culture you don't have to look hard now to find people being awful. 
Yea, I felt like I was developing “dry eye” from work + school screen time and my eye doctor told me to do this ^ as well. Also, instead of just looking at something 20ft away, to do 10-20 “long blinks” where you keep your eyes shut for one second in between each. 
\&gt; I don't think any toxic culture lives for very long. Ah, just like free markets are suppose to self-correct? Toxic cultures can exists perfectly fine. There is a growing list of topics that if you speak out about in American politics, you are a Marxist which is just a reassurance of an old ignorance. &amp;#x200B; Toxic cultures can exist perfectly fine so long as they dilute the minds of those involved that fundamentally challenge is "the lesser of two evils"... in this state it's clear the voter has accepted a position that is toxic/problematic/etc. This is how the SJW have made this attack against the author, believing they are doing the \`Good Fight\` when they probably are just slightly better than Neo-Nazis (if we are going to start rating people which is a slippery slow I have you know). &amp;#x200B; Toxic cultures can exist so long as there is a means for the trash to get dumped. For instance it doesn't matter how shit America gets, as long as reddit is open for people to soap box, 95% of the issues of a against populace or subdued. This doesn't mean the American political climate is less toxic and it hasn't been getting more toxic for the last few centuries. &amp;#x200B; Toxic cultures can exist when axioms are not understood to be accepted on faith and thus followed almost all modern monetary practice and economy policy. Look how toxic the world is getting... &amp;#x200B; The idea that things self-correct... without first self-reflection... that's a pipe dream. &amp;#x200B; But tells me lies about the OSS community. 
Hello, I am really sorry for being a complete noob in this (I am more of a networking guy), but I had a project pop up where something like this would be extremely helpful. I installed Python 3.7 and looked up some basic tutorials but am very confused. Would someone mind showing me what to do from square one really quick? If I could get this program to work, it would be a complete lifesaver. Again, I am extremely sorry for being a complete noob here. I just need to setup the basics for this program to work and that's it. Thank you
Hey I can help you. What kind of computer are you using? (Windows/Mac/Linux..) &amp;#x200B; (Step 1 is the same for all of them) 1) Download the source code [here](https://gist.github.com/SamyBencherif/29a0a945cabff92a4b61d78a5fe072a5/archive/3d56a07495b24b525d5f669f0f7814c9ebde4d43.zip)
Nice project! Can anyone point me to any scholarly articles that show that this kind of “20/20/20” technique actually works and improves health outcomes for these types of vision issues? 
I think you mean commutative, not associative
Video should be at least 25 seconds long
Yes you're right.
I am using Windows. I found a tutorial and was able to install numpy and opencv (My problem was I was using pip install instead of py -m pip install). I downloaded the source code and ran it. Got a ModuleNotFoundError: No module named '\_curses' Thank you for offering to help so quick!
Ah ok. So you have the source, have the python, and are executing the code at this point. That is good news. It appears to me that the problem is that Windows Python does not come with curses out of box. Try \`pip install windows-curses\`
It is not the actual API Key. I do appreciate your concern. 
{ "Error Message": "the parameter apikey is invalid or missing. Please claim your free API key on (https://www.alphavantage.co/support/#api-key). It should take less than 20 seconds, and is free permanently." }
dictionaries aren't sets, though, they're a mapping between a set and a collection of *potentially non-unique* values. It doesn't make sense to me to think of adding 2 dicts together to mean merging 2 sets; to me it means updating one dict from the other, which guarantees non-commutativity (spelling?).
Yes that worked!! Thank you so much! You just saved me sooo much headache! It is currently working flawlessly. I can't thank you enough!!!!!!!!!
github?
I just use https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/pprint.html#pprint.pprint
At least it’s not mine!
So you’re saying I should thank my coworkers when they constantly interrupt me.
Read sidebar?
you have to take account of full screen. it would be annoying when there's something playing on screen. 
If they have strict backwards compatibility requirements. For example, it's common for particular Linux distros to ship a specific version of Python (3.4) and want bug fixes and security updates, but *not* automatically upgrade to the next one (3.5 etc).
Talented developer is harrassed for not including what harassers see as "progressive" ideals in his projects. Talented developer gets sick of it and bails. Pretty disappointing.
&gt; Here's a copy I found that's still on GitHub . Awesome thanks. I saved it.
Ok last thing (it is fine if it isn't possible): Is there a way to make the characters more spaced out and implement brightness and make them white? Thank you so much again
Easy there, British grandmother.
I just assume my performance will get better, because generally it does. not that unlikely you'll find a bug in Python, a change in Python or some issue in a well respected 3rd party library. I just assume my performance will get better, becuase generally it does.
Mobile, apologize for formatting. Is there a reason you do if not value: else instead of if value:else? 
There are awful people everywhere. Social media has made it worse. But I am a person of color who was in computing at the time and your invalidation of my experiences, are frankly offensive.
I used linux at home but then I couldn't play League so I had to switch back. Unfortunately my addiction to League is stronger than my desire of privacy and I'm too fucking lazy to reboot into Linux after I'm done.
Yeah, a new board seems to be around the corner, but the v1.1 version is now in stock again, as well, finally.
I have at least a dozen linux machines in my house including my phone and TV. You can't escape linux.
That or complete misundertstanding. The disaster is over. Python 2.7 is tanking rapidly. The first major speedup also came from Python 2.7, so the whole idea is wrong to begin with.
I use VTK, but there's also things like Ogre and pyOpenGL. Are you trying to make a game or something else?

Been using this for quite some time. It's awesome! Thanks!
Please read a subreddit's sidebar before posting to it. Try Sublime Text and ipython. For sublime, install the package manager, then a package called Anaconda (no relation to a python thing with the same name). 
&gt; "progressive" ideals Such as? If you have a link to the harassment I'd be even more thankful - I imagine this is all supposed to be happening in public mailing lists?
I'm sorry if you feel that way, it doesn't mirror my experiences or memories of the early internet. The worst was seeing a new person admit they were a girl/woman and having a chat turn on them immediately. Most mundane fact in the world, and instantly the worst mistake you could make.

Hello, I'm interested in became a Python tutor. I'm studying Bachelor of Computer Information Systems, at University of State of Santa Catarina (UDESC), Brazil. I've been studying Python for the last year and I think that can be a really good opportunity for me.

Which part you are struggling and looking for help with particularly? Is this "I need someone to review the code that I wrote" or "I need someone to do my homework for me" kind of question?
kinda everything. This is what I have so far but when I run the code it tells me that score1 = getTestScore() NameError: name 'getTestScore' is not defined &amp;#x200B; this is what I have. &amp;#x200B; def main (): score1 = 0.0 score2 = 0.0 score3 = 0.0 &amp;#x200B; score1 = getTestScore() score2 = getTestScore() score3 = getTestScore() calcAvgAndDisplayResults(score1, score2, score3) &amp;#x200B; def getTestScore(): test = 0.0 test = float(input("Enter a test score between 0 and 100: ")) &amp;#x200B;
put your getTestScore function before main function
Python 3.4 *just* got retired literally today. Come off it man. 
That's.... so strange. I'm not even sure I see the point. This whole thing seems toxic
I would handle the test scores as a list. use `min()` to find the value in the list - [https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/methods/built-in/min](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/methods/built-in/min) you can then remove that value from the list with `list.remove(value)` \- [https://docs.python.org/3.7/tutorial/datastructures.html](https://docs.python.org/3.7/tutorial/datastructures.html) then you can use `sum(remaining_list) / len(remaining_list)` to get the average - [https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/methods/built-in/sum](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/methods/built-in/sum), [https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/methods/built-in/len](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/methods/built-in/len) for the bonus, you can use these quick example below to get started - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23294658/asking-the-user-for-input-until-they-give-a-valid-response, https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#func-range ``` def get_test_score(): while True: provided_value = float(input('input test score: ')) if provided_value in range(0, 100): return provided_value ```
Yup, just an XML namespace, working with soap it's extremely common. Lxml will be the library you want to use. A quick dance of the fingers brought me to [this](https://lxml.de/tutorial.html#namespaces) documentation page for lxml, with a section regarding namespaces
I'm not sure how I've offended anyone by simply suggesting that a feature in a newer version might help.
Any chance, uvloop will be incorporated into quart?

Couldn't be better timing for this post. Thank you!
::sigh::
It's completely toxic.
Let me tell you a story: I was one the people who hated Roberto without even knowing who he was. I used to do so because I was convinced that all the things being said about him were true. That he was a misogynist, that he opposed Codes of Conduct because he wanted to get away with being an a-hole in public, that he was homophobic, etc, etc, etc. Then I found Mayan EDMS. It was brilliant. It was a piece of software art. It was the perfect tool for the paper problem we were having at our design house, and then some. My conundrum: it was built by one of the people I loathed the most. Social media teaches us to hate and punch nazis right? Why then should we also respect the software terms, licenses or copyrights of nazis? I improved the UX of Mayan and released my work as Open Paperless. I didn't credited Roberto or respected the terms of the license. I didn't cared. I thought I was doing my part. I was hitting a nazi where it hurt. Open Paperless became a bigger thing than I expected, way, way bigger. The extra attention exposed the licensing issue. The initial praise for my genius frontend work died down and my inbox was now filled with vitriol for stealing someone else's work. I was enraged, I doubled down. Standing my ground didn't changed the laws of copyright. My bosses had learned about my viral stunt. I was facing the very real possibility of losing my job, becoming a pariah in the design business for the foreseeable future, and legal action from several vectors. I learned what vicarious liability was, and it is a concept I'll never forget. I've burned bridges, did the scorched earth playbook, opened a Patreon to get money to mount a legal defense, and sat back expecting (as I had been taught) that my status as a woman of a minority race would take care of everything. Nobody came to my rescue. I had only one move left: I reached out to Roberto. His reply shattered every preconception I had about him, about the communities and the networks he had fostered for years. Everything I had been led to believe was a lie. Almost every social construct on which I based my reality was on quicksand and sinking fast. Roberto and the Mayan core team offered guidance and support. The licensing problems we fixed. They offered technical help. They offered to help me improve my work. They offered to include my work if I wanted. Instead of an arrogant leader creating a toxic army of man-babies I found the best group of human beings I've ever found. For the first time that I can remember I was given choice. I was not being told what to do, what to think. Go my own way and they would still help me learn more and improve my work; become a part of their team to learn more and include my work. I'm now a member of the Mayan EDMS core team. Instead of suing my employers and having me lose my job, Roberto negotiated an agreement that allows me to work of Mayan EDMS as part of my paid work for as long as I want it to continue. I get to help improve the user experience of Mayan EDMS, learn for a top tier group of software developer and excellent human beings, and I get paid for it! Soon after I learned that my story inside Mayan EDMS is not unique. Mayan is a foster home for the disenfranchised. Be it disenfranchised feminists, "SJWs", "right wingers". Roberto is an excellent judge of character and is able to see past people's initial bullshit facade. He can see past all the labels. The ones other tag you with, and the ones you cover yourself with. When you join the team, you shed your labels, they are not needed anymore, you need not accept the ones given to you. You start the journey to become a better version of yourself, in every aspect. As the saying goes: "Culture trumps strategy". How did it Roberto came to create such rich culture of acceptance, diversity, and excellence? As the comedic phrase goes too: "He is not just the president but also a client". This is here I'm at today and the ending of my story. I have much to be thankful for, so I thought I would do Roberto some justice (even when he specifically asks us not to talk about these topics). Now, there will always be someone in a forum that will attempt to disregard my story using the usual playbook: she is being coerce, it's fake, it's a sock puppet account, she internalized misogyny, it's russian bot, it's a 4chan trolling, etc, etc, etc. I know, because it's what I would have done, as I was taught to do, when facts with merit dismantle my narrative. Now you know better. 
Good thing it's easy to change.

\&gt; Pygubu requires Python &gt;= 2.7 (Tested only in Python 2.7.3 and 3.2.3 with tk8.5). I hope that's not all it supports, but the package hasn't been updated in 4 years. 2.7.3 is \~7 years old.
&gt;to me it means updating one dict from the other, which guarantees non-commutativity (spelling? And the correct symbol to use would be "+", even though that more commonly represents an operation that *is* commutative?

I personally think the best platform to utilize the skills of Python is in the [Field Data Science](http://www.cetpainfotech.com/technology/data-science-training), so you can move to Data Science which is one of the most popular technology of Today.
Thank you, this is exactly what I've been looking for. I'm currently tasked with building a GraphQL API which will be used in a decently sized project, considered biting the bullet and using Go but was afraid to leave my comfort zone with Python.

That's cool!
Anything for Mac? I think SafeEyes does not work for Mac.
Linus has been a good boy lately. Keeping his temper in check. Please don't discount the effort he is putting in to be a better person.
I disagree completely. As someone who has been the center of drama, his struggle speaks volumes to me. There is no explanation he can give that'll do him or anyone else good. The domain we're in should be void of these type of topics, which I like to nickname feelsy weelsy. Instead, the principal occupation, namely tech, isn't missing any contribution here. In my person case, I told those relevant what I thought the problem was during development but, ultimately, got up and left. Lastly, more details about this here case aren't buried and are crystal clear - such as the link from another comment here that quotes many drama incidents.
I'm a heavy PyQt user and I feel like I'm in too deep to look too closely at alternatives... can anyone sell me on wxPython at this point? It always seemed like the less popular alternative, but I'm open to arguments on why it might be better for some things. Given how massive Qt is, I imagine applications built with wx are smaller. I would guess perhaps that wx is simpler because it doesn't try to be another batteries-included mega framework. Qt has most of an operating system baked in. I've certainly had issues packaging PyQt before, so maybe that would be easier. Licensing, which is the reason PySide2 and PyQt5 both exist, is presumably more open for wx. I guess since I use things like PyQtGraph and vtk, that limits my options a bit. Quick searching shows that there's far less support for wx in the scientific visualization scene, though I'm sure you can project anything to a canvas if you try hard enough - it's more a question of whether there is a support ecosystem as opposed to everything feeling like a hack.
Stretchly.
Thats a shame. SJW have destroyed many OS projects in the past. 
I think, If you write more than a hundred lines of code using tk, you should use qt, thus making this tool unnecessary. I usually don't even install tk with my py setup. 
Yep, it's on there. Just search for tiquations
&gt; I think you stand to benefit from things like f-strings I mean, look at the code, there are all of 3 string formatting operation, at least one of which they may eventually want to localise. Even if you want to criticise the support of older Python release, I would think a more relevant one is supporting Python 2.7 which precludes the use of [scandir](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.scandir) or `device, *_` in the df output.
Hi! I think this is really cool!
Ah a good old "ain't my problem", I love it 😂
Thanks
It's 79 character limit. I don't know why not 80 (tell me if you know it). I like short lines because I can have another window next to the editor. I would probably accept 100 characters per line but not 120 because that would take more than half of my screen width.
Hi, I'm a core team member of Mayan EDMS. We worked very closely with Roberto. Another member of our team made some posts here but they are not showing up. Is Tina Zhou shadow banned?
Part 1 of Tina's post. &amp;#x200B; &gt;Let me tell you a story: &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I was one the people who hated Roberto without even knowing who he was. I used to do so because I was convinced that all the things being said about him were true. That he was a misogynist, that he opposed Codes of Conduct because he wanted to get away with being an a-hole in public, that he was homophobic, etc, etc, etc. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Then I found Mayan EDMS. It was brilliant. It was a piece of software art. It was the perfect tool for the paper problem we were having at our design house, and then some. My conundrum: it was built by one of the person I loathed the most. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Social media teaches us to hate and punch nazis right? Why then should we also respect the software terms, licenses or copyrights of nazis? I improved the UX of Mayan and released my work as Open Paperless. I didn't credited Roberto or respected the terms of the license. I didn't cared. I thought I was doing my part. I was hitting a nazi where it hurt. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Open Paperless became a bigger thing than I expected, way, way bigger. The extra attention exposed the licensing issue. The initial praise for my genius frontend work died down and my inbox was now filled with vitriol for stealing someone else's work. I was enraged, I doubled down. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Standing my ground didn't changed the laws of copyright. My bosses had learned about my viral stunt. I was facing the very real possibility of losing my job, becoming a pariah in the design business for the foreseeable future, and legal action from several vectors. I learned what vicarious liability was, and it is a concept I'll never forget. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I've burned bridges, did the scorched earth playbook, opened a Patreon to get money to mount a legal defense, and sat back expecting (as I had been taught) that my status as a woman of a minority race would take care of everything. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Nobody came to my rescue. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I had only one move left: I reached out to Roberto. &amp;#x200B;
Part 2 of Tina's post. &amp;#x200B; &gt;His reply shattered every preconception I had about him, about the communities and the networks he had fostered for years. Everything I had been led to believe was a lie. Almost every social construct on which I based my reality was on quicksand and sinking fast. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Roberto and the Mayan core team offered guidance and support. The licensing problems we fixed. They offered technical help. They offered to help me improve my work. They offered to include my work if I wanted. Instead of an arrogant leader creating a toxic army of man-babies I found the best group of human beings I've ever found. For the first time that I can remember I was given choice. I was not being told what to do, what to think. Go my own way and they would still help me learn more and improve my work; become a part of their team to learn more and include my work. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I'm now a member of the Mayan EDMS core team. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Instead of suing my employers and having me lose my job, Roberto negotiated an agreement that allows me to work of Mayan EDMS as part of my paid work for as long as I want it to continue. I get to help improve the user experience of Mayan EDMS, learn for a top tier group of software developer and excellent human beings, and I get paid for it! &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Soon after I learned that my story inside Mayan EDMS is not unique. Mayan is a foster home for the disenfranchised. Be it disenfranchised feminists, "SJWs", "right wingers". Roberto is an excellent judge of character and is able to see past people's initial bullshit facade. He can see past all the labels. The ones other tag you with, and the ones you cover yourself with. When you join the team, you shed your labels, they are not needed anymore, you need not accept the ones given to you. You start the journey to become a better version of yourself, in every aspect. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;As the saying goes: "Culture trumps strategy". &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;How did it Roberto came to create such rich culture of acceptance, diversity, and excellence? &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;As the comedic phrase goes too: "He is not just the president but also a client". He himself is a survivor of countless bouts of harassment, doxing, character attacks, you name it. He understand outrage culture like few people I've met. Instead of being a bitter man, he has taken all he's learned and used it to create something that I've never seen anywhere else. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;This is here I'm at today and the ending of my story. I have much to be thankful for, so I thought I would do Roberto some justice (even when he specifically asks us not to talk about these topics). &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Now, there will always be someone in a forum that will attempt to disregard my story using the usual playbook: she is being coerce, it's fake, it's a sock puppet account, she internalized misogyny, it's russian bot, it's a 4chan trolling, etc, etc, etc. I know, because it's what I would have done, as I was taught to do, when facts with merit dismantle my narrative. Now you know better. &amp;#x200B;
Totally unreasonable. The whole point of having new version releases is to have a place to introduce new features. 
TimeOut 
It doesn't need to be incorporated into Quart, it can instead be a choice of the ASGI server. By default Quart uses Hypercorn as the ASGI server, which does incorporate uvloop (although not by default).
I've tried and read about the projects I've mentioned, which gives me confidence to comment on then. I've not used Tornado enough to comment though.

I create 3D-Simulations for upcoming automated warehouses with a software called Visual Components. All the logic (movement of robots, pathfinding for products etc.) is done via Python. Currently I'm working on a tire warehouse which will be built in Spain. I love this kind of work because you immediately see a result in what you program :) Also I can learn a lot in terms of logistics which will help me later on in my career path!
Isn't Tkinter part of the standard library? That's why it's still popular.

the only thing i can think about relating to this post is whether or not you're using pycharm
Okay. To convert an ISO 8601 datetime in UTC to Unix time, this does the trick: `calendar.timegm(datetime.datetime.strptime("2019-01-18T08:31:00Z", "%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ").timetuple())` Hopefully this is helpful to someone else when trying to deal with UTC timestamps, Unix time and ISO 8601 datetime values in Python.
Use aiohttp's client for that. (Works just fine with whatever async web server you're using)
I could have been nicer there, sorry about that. It seems like after years of the python 2 vs 3 talk with so many posts and comments all over the web, it has just very recently died down, and I was enjoying the break. 
If you really want an IDE, you might look at [Thonny](https://thonny.org/). It's simple and lightweight. I have no idea if it'll run on a 32 bit machine, but that's easy to figure out!
Just start smoking and breaks will come naturally :D
The existing ASGI frameworks I know of are: &amp;#x200B; * Starlette * Quart * FastAPI * Bocadillo * Responder &amp;#x200B; I'd suggest that they're all good options. Starlette has a range of middleware, all of which will work with \*any\* ASGI framework, plus a test client which'll work with any ASGI framework. If you work with any of those you're backing a whole ecosystem, rather than a single framework. There's a range of different servers too - they'll all run under any of \`uvicorn\`, \`daphne\`, or \`hypercorn\`, so you can bet on having more than one supported option for the low level networking stuff, and transparently switch out to another if you ever needed to. That also means they can run under uvloop or not, and run on any of Unix, Mac, or Windows just fine. &amp;#x200B; Two other candiates, which are not ASGI based, but are really worth options from a point of view of maturity. &amp;#x200B; * Sanic * aiohttp &amp;#x200B; The Sanic team are keen on moving towards ASGI too, which is a big positive. Of those two I'd prefer it for that reason. &amp;#x200B; I'm really impressed with the work in Vibora, but I personally think cythonising the entire framework, and tightly coupling all the components together are problematic. &amp;#x200B; Broadly agree with much of @stetio's post - with one exception. I strongly wouldn't opt for a trio-based server implementation. Trio has undoubtably helped push asyncio forward massively, is more thoughly designed, and the core concept of "nurseries" and how to manage task lifetimes is a really big deal. However as an application developer it doesn't really matter - newer versions of Python will bring task supervision in, as a result of trio's work. You're not going to be writing the network primatives yourself, and all you really care about is using the "async/await" syntax, rather than "which event loop implementation am I working on top of". Because trio (or curio) is neccessarily incompatible with the rest of asyncio, you'll end up locking yourself into a much smaller ecosystem, without really benefitting. (Eg. With asyncio you've got aiohttp for HTTP requests, aiosmtplib for SMTP, aiocache for Redis or Memcached support, asyncpg for interacting with Postgres etc.etc.etc.) &amp;#x200B;

Hi. can you please explain what marshmallow is for? I'm using a jsonify from flask and have no idea why this is better?
Right when I needed a GUI, thanks for sharing.

The average person now has access to more data and more powerful tools and computing resources for analyzing that data than ever before in human history.

Someone needs to tell Python then, as they backported a lot of 3.x features into 2.x, and older 3.xs.
GamerGate is basically two camps of equal shitheels flinging shit at each other, the opposition can hardly take any form of high ground.
Hi, are you able to share the code for this? I'm trying to do something similar at the moment to upload client data for my business to our CRM automatically (the CRM doesn't have an API to allow us to do this). 
That's an adorable like to tell yourself but gamer gate was a fucking hate mob crafted specifically to harass people.
literally as easy as pd.read_csv('path_to_csv')
DUNGK
It would be great if their Python API documenation actually told you what you need to cleanup and what you don't. Saying "Read the C++ API" isn't helpful to people who don't know C++.
Well, that's just like your opinion man. Guess John Peter Bain deserved having people rejoicing after dying of cancer because he wanted more transparency in gaming journalism as well? There's PLENTY of assholes on both sides. The counter movement is full of assholes who try their absolute best to ready the pitchforks for the smallest of reasons.
Thanks a lot! 
I'm not relitigating this just because you want a nice lie to tell yourself about how both sides are awful and terrible. GG was purpose built as a harassment campaign and launched off a jilted boyfriend's very carefully written and targetted letter. That is what it was about from day one. You are free to do the reading on your own time.
cool stuff. 
I think that was just an oversight on my part
I bet you can play it now on Linux with Proton. I have what appears to be my full library back.
The pessimist version: return False
Vim
It's a fair point--I said 'might' with connexion and should have been less proscriptive for Marshmallow too!
If you're just outputting values, then jsonify will be totally fine. Marshmallow is helpful for validating incoming data, and for automatically creating sqlalchemy model instances if that's necessary.
You are right. The good thing is the Qt guys are aware of this problem. There is now a Python version of the Qt documentation: https://doc.qt.io/qtforpython/ I have talked one of the core people behind the PySide2 support of the Qt Company about the camelCasing "problem". They thought about auto-converting everything. Still wouldn't make the toolkit 100% pythonic, but would be a good start. I also think there is potential for one of the wrappers to solve this problem. Something like attrs for PyQt/PySide2 could be useful as well to avoid the Qt property boilerplate.
wxPython is pretty large as well, but it may not be as large at Qt. I actually started using wxPython before PySide was an option so the licensing of PyQt + wxPython's community is what ultimately drove me to wxPython. Anyway, I have seen some people who have added VTK support to wxPython. And wxPython has a simple plotting widget, but it also supports matplotlib. There is an OpenGL widget, but I've never played around with that. 
It is as easy as that &gt; \&gt; pip install pyside2 but QtDesigner is missing, which is a huge mistake. The examples deep down in the lib folder are bad because they don't show how the organize the code in a reasonable manner with Qt. And then, how to make custom widgets efficient? As long as someone makes a simple application TkInter quite good
Can you be any more condescending? In the beginning journalistic integrity in games media was also a part of the movement. But you can believe in your adorable lie that it started as a purpose built harassment campaign, as if 4chan trollers &amp; alt-righters somehow sat down &amp; united. I did follow it for a short while when it began, but you probably have a better view of it since you seem quite invested in it.

The thing I miss is context managers (Python's `with`) There's a good example by Hettinger where he converts [this](https://gist.github.com/Maecenas/5878ceee890a797ee6c9ad033a0ae0f1#file-p_vs_np_2_raymond_hettinger_pycon2015-py) into [this](https://gist.github.com/Maecenas/5878ceee890a797ee6c9ad033a0ae0f1#file-p_vs_np_3_raymond_hettinger_pycon2015-py).

Thanks.
You should get something you can throw at them, not only will you get the 20 feet away for 20 seconds, but you can improve hand eye coordination too. Win, win win
I'm a beginner as well, but you could do something like this: list_one = ['ceg', 'fac', 'gbd'] list_two = ['dfa', 'egb', 'ace'] notes = input("Enter notes: ") if notes in list_one: print(notes[0] + "maj") elif notes in list_two: print(notes[0] + 'min') &amp;#x200B;
This probably belongs in r/learnpython. That said, I'll give you the first step here and you can go there if you need clarification. Or / and separate tests and a non-empty string always evaluates to true. You need to turn that to something like: if notes == 'ceg' or notes == 'fac'...: Or use a list: If notes in ['ceg', 'fac',...]:
Thank you for the advice good sir!
That's funny. I've always found that I lose the ability to pay attention to anything after about twenty minutes of intent focus. When I was a kid, I got into the habit of taking ~90 sec. breaks every twenty minutes of studying or homework. I still do it, even when I'm reading a book or working on a project. I find that it gives me time to digest what I've done, or think about what I've read before beginning again. I never would have thought that it was anything but a coping mechanism for my short attention span. 
Sweet! Thank you
On the one hand I agree that anyone willing to learn more (even by building out an app) should be encouraged. On the other hand, it's just as important to learn when something's as close to "done" as it should be if you want to be successful in this industry.
No problem. Normally when I create a new package, I provide support for the latest release and gradually add support for lesser minor versions as they're required. I personally prefer to leverage the features I've got in the later versions rather than implicitely supporting older minor versions when I don't have to. I find I enjoy developing more that way. That's just me, though. 
No it actually wasn't part of it from the beginning. That crap was invented litteraly weeks after it started. If you don't know that you don't know anything about GG.
I have a package that reads, manipulates, and writes to GnuCash files. https://github.com/pbromwelljr/gnewcash I implemented it for XML files (default) but recently discovered you can also save it to SQLite, MySQL, or Postgres. So I’m trying to add support for those.
Automated troubleshooter for a hardware platform I support.
I am an utter noob when it comes to Python. I just do programming on occasion, either to learn or to solve a problem. I have been looking for "Delphi for Python" but not found anything nearly as integrated yet. Having a separate toolkit for the GUI seems so backwards as small changes are more or less continuous for me... It looks like a great business opportunity to sell an integrated package that can produce standalone apps.

One thing that wx has going for it, compared to Qt, is using native controls. The default UI widgets in wx, regardless of whether running on Windows, Linux or MacOS, are the ones provided by the operating system, with wx acting as a wrapper around them. So the application looks native by default, and UI controls behave like the OS users have come to expect. I am unfamiliar with vtk, but I have done a good amount of graph plotting in wx, using matplotlib, which has support for wx just as it does for Qt. Did not encounter any particular problems.

I'm trying to come up with a set of pushdown automata that can read/write MessagePack. My hope is that I can make things easier to reimplement if there is a formally demonstrated flow for how to do it (although honestly, the spec is pretty easy to implement as is).
I understand how this can be very appealing to beginners, cause I have been there as well, but trust me this is barely a gimmick, cool thing to show to your friends but not gonna lie man, this feels kinda misleading on how applications like this actually work. Specially the Google's API for Speech Recognition only allows 50calls per day I guess. (No disrespect to the creator, he has done a fairly decent job of explaining the program that he wrote).

Just checking... but are you aware that [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is different to Visual Studio? People often complain about resource usage in Visual Studio Code, but you mind find it runs OK.
Scammer? If your gonna be one of those people that screw old people out of money by stealing credit cards, don't think anyone can help you. Also your a student if your parents can see it as a worthwhile purchase to help you in school then idk what to say. Just buy a new one your over 18 year, parents cant do jack.

Oh yeah. The reason I don't do tricks like that (or OOP or even list comprehensions) was that I'm writing these games for a beginner/intermediate-level audience, and wanted to keep the code as simple as possible. Sometimes that means using a line or two extra.
Hey there, sorry about this. The board is super new and we're still trying to fill it with junior roles. Should have made this a lot clearer when posting. If you have experience with any other languages, our other boards might have more of what you're looking for?

It would be more elegant to remove your comment.
put vk music, and the bot will be perfect 
I have also created some 3.6+ things, but for something that is 50% CLI 50% user scripting targeted, and since it is such a small effort with a small codebase, and I possess the knowledge of how to make things 2 and 3 compatible.... no reason to be exclusive.

Are these paid articles, or on a volunteer basis? 
Working on a module that will automatically check an API for updates to its data.
Well, none of these articles are paid. All the author of the articles you can see on our site are still studying in colleges across our country. We are increasing the connection day by day with colleges. All those college students also like to make their online presence.
Heyyyy.... I saw a blogpost about just this project &gt;.&lt;
Also, we have accepted those students as intern.
no problem :)

Since I posted about [creating wxPython applications](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/b2jk8i/how_to_build_a_python_gui_application_with/) yesterday, I thought it would be fun to post another article on distributing the application as an executable.
This is a good point and one I meant to bring up. I believe wxPython is also the only GUI toolkit that uses native controls directly.
Could be, I dont experience with pymongo directly 
Tweak my poolsize and my queue concurrency I can get node processing 5 k documents a second. In theory my python code should be faster, I might try monkey patching with gevent.
I've been switching between two projects. My main thing is a simple cash flow/budgeting program to move away from my budget spreadsheet I've been running for years now. Basically will allow the user (either through CLI, some form of TUI/curses type thing, or an XMPP bot) to enter transactions and keep track of them. Will be able to view transactions by category and by month, comparing them across each other as well (same compared to a budget if present). The other thing I'm working on is a lot more simple, just a dotfile and full system installation script. Thinking of trying out a Void Linux installation, so I booted up a virtual install and running through what dotfiles should be set-up from a git repo. If a full install is selected, it should install from the distro repos all of the software necessary to finalize my setup!
&gt; I tried to make one but it was too hard. I also dabbled with this idea after asyncio came out. The idea was to see if the event loop made sense to use as a gui event loop. Basically, initial idea was to implement all of the primitives that qt provides which are needed for guis, but are not already provided by python. (So, implement drawing and such, but not things like strings or dates or whatever is already built in and pythonic). Then target the feature set of Qt 1.4.x as the minimum feature set. Modern Qt has a lot of great stuff in it for things like SQL, networking, serial port access, etc. But none of that is really needed in python. It is either covered in the base libs, or there are excellent pythonic implementations. So it would be completely restricted to a nice pythonic old school gui toolkit. I gave up. I got libxcb working as pure python3 and was able to draw some squares on the screen. Then I realized I'd be in for about 10k hours of coding just to proof of concept.
I made similar project showing where ISS and other satellite are. Instead of using API's you can use a Two Line Element Set (*TLE*) from here [http://www.celestrak.com/NORAD/elements/](http://www.celestrak.com/NORAD/elements/) and read it using [https://pythonhosted.org/OrbitalPy/](https://pythonhosted.org/OrbitalPy/), you will get the location and other info like speed, orbit parameters. Plot actual position on map, or even show your position on map base o your IP if you want use google API. Here is what i did and how did it look like [https://github.com/AstroSlazak/Mechanika-Nieba](https://github.com/AstroSlazak/Mechanika-Nieba) (Sorry for note using english language in comments :( that was my school project) and here is screen from the final version of it.

Yeah I was ready for some project involving some NLP or something, but I was kind of let down when I saw the video.
Wow this is so simple yet amazing. I always wanted to make this exact application(on android). But got busy in other stuff and this was forgotten in my list of to-dos. 
I am currently in the same state as you, (trying to build a PA). Kinda sucks when people simplify complex stuff like this.
&gt; The other thing I'm working on is a lot more simple, just a dotfile and full system installation script. Thinking of trying out a Void Linux installation, so I booted up a virtual install and running through what dotfiles should be set-up from a git repo. If a full install is selected, it should install from the distro repos all of the software necessary to finalize my setup! Have you looked into [stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/)? I've seen a few people use this for dotfile management.
Agreed. It's OK for the project to be limited in scope (especially if you're just learning how to use the tools), but advertising it as "JARVIS from Iron Man" instead of basically a chat bot is misleading at best and deceptive at worst.
Couldn't have said it better myself.

If you can run chrome, you should be able to run VS Code. If you can't run chrome, buy ANYTHING. A Raspy. A compute stick. An Odroid. ANYTHING.
&gt; To circumvent this problem is very easy. We just need to set up a timer kicking off our event loop every few milliseconds. Or you create a pipe, connect it with signal.set_wakeup_fd() and make the other end an event source for the event loop, like we do in PyGObject.
tl;dw: * the chatterBot module creates an AI that can respond to text with text * The chatterBot.trainer submodule lets the AI read a list of potential responses and add it to its intelligence * The speech\_recognition module is self-explanatory * The gTTS module converts text to speech This is great, I love it.

That is correct, sorry for missposting :(
This is cool project, for more advanced one take a look at https://kalliope-project.github.io/. I have used it a little bit and works really nice. It uses Python too. 
 that’s my bad, definitely not trying to be misleading! My programming skillset is limited and I’m just playing around with it. I can’t change the title, but I can add a comment..? 
 This is more of a beginner project that mostly uses chatterbot. Maybe not best for those seeking a more in-depth AI video!
=D
It's a good title, nice enough for new comers to get excited and maybe dive a little deeper into the actual nitty gritty details of building an actual NLP processing chatbot. If you could include some instructions for the viewers to find out what they can do learn more about these topics would be much appreciated. Saying this again, no disrespect to you or your content, a little nudge in the right direction for the viewers is required that's all. 
Back in the day I wrote a Linux bash script that did the same. I also had a script, that when enabled, would prompt me to click "okay" and restart my computer if I didn't click it in 10 seconds. 
This is neat. Thank you for sharing.
Heh. . . Link please?
this is amazing bro but i am not sure this is for the beginners
Nice idea. I made something similar over a year ago [https://github.com/keessonnema/Kezbot](https://github.com/keessonnema/Kezbot) I've tried yours and it works very similar. Mine just does Youtube &lt;&gt; Spotify urls. 
Cool. Unfortunately did not found it :c And also my first problem was converting YouTube Music to YouTube video. And then my colleague added Spotify. After that I decided to redone it with proper design.
Really nice article and retrospective - especially interesting were the thoughts around how developing a project the slow and steady can have some big advantages.
Hit me up if you need another opinion or have questions. Maybe we could work something out.
Try /r/learnpython or the python discord. See the sidebar for more information. Also, check sidebars for rules before posting in subreddits.
so just curious but how does this work? is it only meant to be used inline? i sent the bot a youtube link but nothing happened. 
Recruitment is often comprised of non-technical individuals. That approach may be confusing them a bit to much
Noice and neat project. Nothing wrong or too misleading. 
I think this kind of should VA should be built following bottom up approach. You know all those nifty little scripts that just does one thing best. Build a bunch of them . Integrate them on a common framework. Require as little command as possible. Then one could move to speech recognition, computer vision all those other cool stuffs. 
Yeah. YouTube have some problems currently. We're planning to remove YouTube from input because it's hard to determine is the link is a video or a music. It still will convert links to YouTube
We're planning to remove YouTube from input because it's hard to determine is the link is a video or a music. What do you think? Did you found a way to correctly get only music URLs and a title from YouTube?
I have not yet implemented music.youtube. I am planning on though. I'll figure something out this weekend, shouldn't be too hard using regex (my bot already uses regexes for YT and Spotify)
Have you install the serial module? "pip install pyserial" and then "from serial import Serial" .... On Stack Overflow you can find other options that may help
YouTube Music is okay. I meant just a YouTube. Users can name videos whatever they want.
it’s generally good practice to include it in the post yourself. 30 seconds of work on your end vs 10 seconds of work on 100 people’s ends. Its just time efficient 
what ideas? i am really bored and would like some ideas to code.
&gt; Django Software Foundation developer member (Ejected) &gt; &gt; Django Software Foundation corporate member (Ejected) I'm aware that this has been claimed. And complaints about it made their way to the DSF Board of Directors. There was no record we could find of him being nominated for individual membership in the DSF, and I just [searched the archives of the DSF members mailing list](https://i.imgur.com/9FW2bLy.png) and got no results. We did find a record of a corporate membership that may have been him and/or his company, but it lapsed for non-payment of dues (DSF corporate memberships [require yearly payment of the appropriate level of dues](https://www.djangoproject.com/foundation/corporate-membership/#dues)). As far as I'm aware, the DSF Board never took any type of targeted action against him, or against a company he was an employee or owner of.
I know people on reddit have complained about DjancoCon US hosting too many talks about topics related to Django and Django development (i.e., talks about choosing frontend tools, or about how to build good engineering teams). I can't say with certainty what any particular individual's reasons are for choosing not to attend, though.
Fresh install and update everything solved it
Thanks look interesting. Can you include github page please. 
Yes i have installed them through pip, i dont know why its doing it lmao, ill comment if i find the fix though
Yes, it is rather an alternative to the GitHub, not to classic resume or LinkedIn
Icic. Thanks 
Oh just simple ones like a little tool which converts your clipboard content in a markdown readable table format. Automating a few tedious stuffs like that. Inspired by another user, maybe program a little tool to remind me to look away from the monitor to protect my eyes from eye strain. 
Essentially - I’m new with python and I’m trying to write a program that will accept my user input in the form of a Wikipedia page title then python will scrape the wiki api and send the summary to my console or terminal

Have you done some profiling or basic measures of what step takes time ? Seems to me that opening and closing that file so often could also have a performance impact. Have you considered using queues to (1) feed the workers from the db and (2) handle file writing in an unique process/thread?
Not yet, in node I am using async/queue to push in docs and then save it, though maybe the way node opens files is faster? I will look into uses two queues, though at this might I may as well keep the node script so its processing mighty faster. It was more wonder why python as so much slower.

Hey ive done a similar project before, just look into beautifulsoup. Its very.. very handy
Any language can handle this, including Python. What is your specific question? Is it a good question for /r/LearnPython?
1. Read the sidebar 2. Go to r/learnpython 3. Read the sidebar there 4. Look for similar questions there and on Stackoverflow 5. If you don't find _any_ leads (which you will), ask on /r/learnpython 6. If nobody answers there, ask on Stackoverflow
Im into reverse engineering and got hold of a fun piece of c++ ransomware a year back, after alot of research and testing i started developing my own. I am finally finishing my PoC entirely written in python. May post it on github soon with my documentation so others can learn from this project 
Ah, that is interesting. I have not heard about that before but I would be interested in seeing something like that if I was used to reviewing people’s githubs. It may be a bit more cumbersome to read through though
First of all, nice job with this! This was very interesting introduction to making a "Jarvis". I know the basics with Python and I wanted to try this but I've ran to some problems. With Python 3.7 I couldn't run the program because VisualStudio doesn't support 3.7 so I installed 3.6 and 3.5 (and VisualStudio). With 3.6 I got the following error message: `dbapi_connection.execute('PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL')` With 3.5 I cant the the module gtts to work. What version are you using and what library versions have you installed?
"haters"? 
As a hiring manager I’m not sure how useful it would be. I don’t really care how many lines you wrote or whether you had some amount of comments. Whether you worked on a big team is far, far less interesting than what you did on that team and what your interactions with that team were (outside of code). Maybe it provides useful data for junior candidates but beyond that stage the non-coding aspects of software development become much more important.
Trying to come up with a personal system (probably kanban style) to manage my work at the office. I'm mostly sick of the administration side that I need to take care of (documentation mostly, but also time tracking) because I end up with several programs opened at the same time (Excel for time tracking, the company's own ticketing system —which does a terrible job, IMO— in a browser tab, a text editor for notes and documentation, etc. Basically something like this: - It should connect to the ticket system API so when I get a ticket assigned to me it will: - Create a new directory in my filesystem with the issue number - Place the documentation template in said folder (I'll think this one better) - Start time-tracking The system should easily allow me to pause or stop the time-tracking, close the ticket if needed and at the end convert every note taken into a pdf for documentation. I was thinking of doing some extra stuff with email but we are using office right now and can't use the client of my preference because they won't share the passwords. Off the top of my head, I think I'll need these tools: * Flask (I just can't bother with Qt or GTK) * SQLite (to keep a tiny db) I know there are already tools for that but what's the fun in that?
I use a shell. ZSH to be specific. And I use Vim as my editor.
can you recommend a gui builder for wx?
Yes, but some technical recruiters specifically ask for a GitHub profile. It is not clear what they want to see there, especially if there are no work projects, just several pet-projects
Many applicant tracking systems can take extra fields to describe a candidate and so many companies will include GitHub as one such field. My recruiter, for example, asks if the candidate has a project on GitHub for my benefit not theirs. When I look at GitHub I look to see if the called out project has some effort put in to it. Does it seem like the person thought about the thing they were trying to do? Does it seem like something they were interested in? I only take a few minutes to look at any person’s GitHub so I don’t have time to evaluate architecture or code quality. I am just skimming. Any questions I have I just ask in the interview.
Check out CoolProp for thermodynamic calculations. Any kind of simulation or repeatable calculations can be done in python. 
I don't use a GUI builder but u have heard that wxGlade was updated for wxPython 4 - http://wxglade.sourceforge.net/
My brain hurts. Please stop fucking it.

1) No idea what's wrong since we can't see your code. Maybe post it? 2) Questions should go to the /r/learnpython subreddit, not this one.
Once you learn one programming language, the rest are much easier. The main stumbling block isn't the syntax (grammar) but learning how to express a problem as an algorithm (mathematical method).

heaters.
I agree. I started by watching videos on syntax. Then i found a project I wanted to do and researching the functions required. My latest project wasn't XKCD scraper.
Use code code ninja. It’s spaced repetition for coding. https://codecode.ninja.
Thing is, PEP8 doesn't require `snake_case`, it requires consistency: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#function-and-variable-names &gt; mixedCase is allowed only in contexts where that's already the prevailing style (e.g. threading.py), to retain backwards compatibility. Qt would be one of those cases.
I mean, the top comment is basically shitting on him politely.
It sounds like this is the first project you've published. Thanks for sharing it with everyone! I have a bit of feedback below -- mostly style-related. It's meant to be constructive feedback to help you learn. ***** You have two license files -- `LICENSE` and `LICENSE.txt` -- you should delete one of them. Also, you've created the license files with `Copyright (c) 2018 The Python Packaging Authority`. The copyright belongs to *you* and the license should reflect that. ***** You've committed a `__pycache__` directory -- that shouldn't be in your git repo. GitHub provides a pretty good [Python-flavoured](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/gitignore/master/Python.gitignore) `.gitignore` file you can add to the root of your repo to avoid committing things like that in the future. ***** Your `tiquations.help()`, `constants.variables()` and `tiquations.version()` functions are ... unusual. I've not seen anything like that in a Python package before. Most Python projects use docstrings and the [PEP257](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/) conventions (or something similar) for inline documentation and something like Sphinx and Read The Docs to turn that inline documentation into a project website. There's a handy guide to get you started [here](https://docs.python-guide.org/writing/documentation/). ***** Also regarding your help function, opening a web browser without asking the user's permission first would be a giant red-flag for many people to stay far away from a library. I'd also go looking for an alternative to `tiquations` when I saw the `print("Made using Tiquations")` in the `__init__.py`. You can do this instead: ``` import logging logging.getLogger(__name__).info("Made using Tiquations") ``` That at least gives your user to ability to handle the message in a sane way for their environment. By just printing the message on import you've made it impossible for someone to use your package in a tool who's output gets piped to another program. ***** [Semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) isn't a strange new type of decimal number, it's three integers joined together with the `.` character. You're currently on major version `0`, minor version `0`, patch version `9`. If your next change is a bug-fix (like the `quadratic` fix below) you'd increment the patch version and your next release would be `0.0.10`. If you make a minor update that's backwards-compatible (like adding the `pythagoras(a,b,c)` function below) you'd increment the minor version and your next release would be `0.1.0`. If you also *removed* the existing `pythagoras_a`, `pythagoras_b` and `pythagoras_c` functions when adding the `pythagoras(a,b,c)` function, that would require incrementing your major version (because the change is not backwards-compatible) and your next release would be `1.0.0`. Note that whenever you increment your minor version, your patch version resets to `0`. Likewise, when you increment your major version the minor and patch versions both reset to `0`. ***** Your `quadratic` function computes `math.sqrt(num2**2 - (4 * (num1) * (num3))))` twice, and that's likely the most computationally expensive part of the function. You can just compute it up front and store it in a variable to use for the other calculations. ***** You can combine your three Pythagoras functions into a single function: ``` def pythagoras(a=None, b=None, c=None): """Given two sides of a triangle abc, solve for the missing side.""" have_a, have_b, have_c = a is not None, b is not None, c is not None if not have_a and have_b and have_c: return pythagoras_a(b, c) if have_a and not have_b and have_c: return pythagoras_b(a, c) if have_a and have_b and not have_c: return pythagoras_c(a, b) raise Exception("You must specify exactly two sides.") ```
Yeah, let me clean out some PII and maybe add some comments to make things a little clearer. 
Hi thanks for the response. i checked through his tutorial and am not seeing how to handle this. I also see that he is using alot of different libraries in his tutorial. I do plan on learning those; however, I wanted to learn how to build a flask app without using an ORM or WTForms. Do you happen to know how what I am doing incorrectly in the error above?
Lol. All these days I have been thinking that these developers are so proud they use their pictures for the post 😂
I hope marvel releases a library Chatbot voice that’s sounds like jarvis.
Basic stuff: write code. Like a lot of it. More complex stuff: that's what the internet is for. It's your second brain. For my CS exams (in college) no points are deducted for incorrect syntax so long as your intent is clear.
&gt; I have talked one of the core people behind the PySide2 support of the Qt Company about the camelCasing "problem". &amp;#x200B; That would break backwards compatibility and make it incompatible with PyQt. Per PEP-8: &amp;#x200B; &gt; A style guide is about consistency. Consistency with this style guide is important. Consistency within a project is more important. Consistency within one module or function is the most important. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;1. To be consistent with surrounding code that also breaks it (maybe for historic reasons) -- although this is also an opportunity to clean up someone else's mess (in true XP style). &gt; &gt;2. Because the code in question predates the introduction of the guideline and there is no other reason to be modifying that code. &amp;#x200B;
PyCharm is the best in my opinion
He's critizing his project politely, that's not being a hater, He's making valid points 
It wouldn't hurt to sign up for a free tier AWS account and learn to write python with Lambda.
Agree to disagree.
Look into Pygame. But is it worth it? The answer to that is it depends on what it is you’re making 
Hi there, from the /r/Python mods. We have removed this post as it is not suited to the /r/Python subreddit proper, however it should be very appropriate for our sister subreddit /r/LearnPython or for the r/Python discord: https://discord.gg/3Abzge7.

Why are you using IDLE? Doesn't Sublime have a command prompt?
heaters are so hot right now.
It does, but it can't run the script. Also, I realized that I can just copy/paste from one to the other. 
You can't run the script with the Python command?
Do not think there is a library for that however it is only a few lines of code to implement it yourself. Check out the requests library for http requests.
There are [many cross-platform GUI systems for python](https://docs.python.org/3/faq/gui.html). It is possible to make a "good GUI" in python. As to whether it's worth it or not, that's up to you and what you need.
Sounds like a bog standard Python webapp.
This is no "right way," only a lot of wrong ways and a few less wrong ways.
I created a web app with Python Flask and I use JavaScript to let the user sort tables and show tool tips, mainly because I am not very good with JavaScript 
&gt; bog standard Python webapp I...think I know what this means, "basic"? If so then, yes! Have you made a python webapp? I'm not sure where his use of Javascript would come into play. We wanted to have a shared github repo that we both contribute to.
This sounds cool! If you were better with JS what else do you think you could do?
I think many people's life would be simpler if they stopped packaging idle.
Yes sublime can, there is a plugin for it. You can also run a python program directly from the terminal or by double ckicking it I'd just use pycharm. It'll do everything out of the box.
A modern web application is really two applications in one. A backend application that handles data, and a frontend application that presents it. The javascript skills are necessary for the frontend.
For a desktop app its ok but the code is annoying to write. Use pyqt, pyside or wx tools. For games, renpy (about the only commercially successful python game library) includes its own ui libraries. Kivy can work if you want a non-standard UI. If you are planning on a graphical game and its nkt a visual novel, the godot engine supports Python.
HTML + CSS + javascript code for your web app frontend can be entirely seperated by HTTP API calls to your python backend code. Look into javascript frameworks like Vue, React or Angular and create HTTP API with for example Django REST or Flask.
You can achieve all of that with procedural code, though.

Trying to figure out a good way to implement a user comment section in my Django site that allows markdown formatting but ignores images and title tags and isn’t a security liability or easily susceptible to vandalism. If anyone knows of a markdown library that allows you to easily switch on/off specific parts of syntax, that would be awesome. 
Thank you! I think I'm now leaning towards Django. Any opinions on that?
Hmm server down? Doesn't respond
indeed !!! Just with some more options to build dataframe on the fly.
At work we use cx_Freeze to compile a portable build package for remote installed agents. There's other options too. But if you have control of the environment, even better. For web services and jobs we only need to use Jenkins to ensure requirements are met. Otherwise pure Python scripts n apps "just work", no build needed.
What a cute idea :) You probably already know about this, but pygame offers many of the features you are looking for, including window management, graphics, and audio. That would probably make a good starting point.
Makes me think of bonzi buddy! Try to get some ideas of how you want to present this to the user. Start off basic, you don't need to include every feature right from the start. Just keep them in mind, so as you develop, you're able to expand what you've got. I haven't used it but I agree that pygame is likely where you'll want to look. Also, /r/learnpython should be a good resource for any questions you've got (this is more appropriate for there also)
I don't think it matters. I'd say it comes down to you, what your needs and wants are. Personally, I like Django and never had any issue picking it up, it felt great to me, so I would say Django due to this bias. Many will say flask as it likely has all the features you need. But I would say regarding NLP, I doubt either will have much, or any, bearing on your NLP-specific code. Django and flask in your case are there purely to create the interface between the end user and your NLP algorithms. I would imagine that either way, you're just using it to define rest endpoints. Django and flask won't make your NLP easier to develop, nor will they get in the way: they're just a tool for interfacing with it. So use what you feel is best for your project. Also, this question would be more suited for /r/learnpython, you may want to get more feedback there
Does it really only allow for 50 calls a day? Is there anything else that's unlimited or something high like 20k/day? I can see how this can be turned into something useful for automating things like general workflow, home automation, informational stuff, etc.
Hey thanks man! I've been working on a PA for a Raspberry Pi, and this speech recognition library is way faster than the one I was using.
I couldn't find any alternatives as good as Google, fun part is, they simply don't allow you to use their SRE (speech recognition engine) for money either. Anyhow, if you're interested in Speech Recognition I recommend you go checkout Pocketsphinx, it won't work out of the box though, the accuracy rate is pretty low. However you get to train it however you like. If you're a Machine Learning guy like me, feel free to look into DeepSpeech by mozilla, which has a decent SRE out of the box, it also has a dataset of 1500hours or so of voice data which you can use to train your models. Goto voice.mozilla.com, you can get the data there, also if you do like the project and want to contribute please contribute with your voice, you can read out Mozilla provided text and submit your voice for training purposes, it'll be open for everyone to use and added to their database. 
After that, you went to reddit and failed to provide any useful information about it.
I only had space for a title. What's your question?
Mostly debugging a flask app that I wrote with wonderful thoughts like, “what was I thinking here?” Also adding more logging and comments to help with the negative thoughts previously mentioned.
Pretty much everything. Apparently crumb.py is some sort of interpreter, that huge hexdump is a chunk of code and the colour-shifting window is that code's output. Okay. Probably a pretty cool project, TBH. But what's the purpose of publishing it if you don't provide anything that people could read? Designing a language and autogenerating code are huge topics that each merit a pretty large text (which I personally would love to read). Or at least a Github link. The way it is, the post is just a claim that you have done this great thing, which is not gonna interest people that much.
You're able to make self (text) posts where you'd be able to include a GitHub repo, more information on what this language can do etc
I have nothing on you, but I made this a while back: https://redd.it/8y4kad :)
Do you have a github link, or examples of code/source code? Language design is an interesting subject, but I have no idea what i'm looking at.

&gt;Do you happen to know how what I am doing incorrectly in the error above? Yes. Do you know what line the error is from? Do you know what the error means?
i could load new content or let the user submit data via Ajax without reloading the page (for example, fb allows to post updates without leaving the page). Animation of page elements, fading them in and out, resizing them, moving them, etc. Interactive content, for example games, and playing audio and video. Validating input values of a Web form to make sure that they are acceptable before being submitted to the server. Transmitting information about the user's reading habits and browsing activities to various websites. Web pages frequently do this for Web analytics, ad tracking, personalization or other purposes.

Yea it's just a few lines but it seems like such a common use case that it would be nice to make it easier, and also just import one library. 
Instead of passing your message arg in the redirect, you might want to use flash. It’s a standard flask import. 
You're using `message = result` inside your `signup()` function, but result is never defined before you use it. It's easy to forget that doing a redirect ends the current request in your app and sends the redirect back the the user's browser. If you've added something like a message to the URL that need to be displayed to the user on the next request, you also need to explicitly check if there's a message in the URL and handle the case where there's no message without throwing an error. Of course, if you're doing that and including the message in your HTML output, you just opened your site up to a potential XSS bug. To avoid the XSS issues you need to ensure only _you_ can ever set the content of a message. There are a multitude of ways to do that, but the easiest is `flash()` (in your Python code) and `get_flashed_messages()` (in your templates). Other options include pre-defining all your messages and passing the tokens that represent each of them or signing the message strings and verifying the signatures (!) before displaying them. tl;dr Use [flash messages](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/patterns/flashing/) instead of passing messages around in URLs. 
Unlike urllib, tkinter is a core library that depends on a 3.rd party external library (like sqlite) but still, just like urllib there's a better alternative. I don't remember the last time I used urllib, 2011 maybe. 
I should add that although I applaud your desire to learn the "hard way" of doing things before using libraries to make life easier, authentication, user management and password storage are some of those things that are incredibly easy to get _dangerously_ wrong. If you're planning to use this code for anything beyond a learning exercise, stop doing those yourself and use a mature library.
If you're calling out to 3rd party services go with an async framework like [starlette](https://github.com/encode/starlette) so that you're not blocking on io. ML APIs can be pretty slow and with a framework like django or flask each of those requests will eat up a worker process.

Bokeh might be helpful but I don't think it's embedded.
I've got the perfect thing ... https://github.com/manatlan/wuy It let you build a powerful GUI, using chrome (in app mode), for the front. A minimal JS lib to communicate (thru WebSocket) with the back, which is full python over aiohttp. It's only Python and Js ;-) (it's a bit like python-eel) On front side, you can use whatever lib, but vuejs fits well, if you use https://github.com/manatlan/vbuild too.

Nothing like "exposure" for driving eyeballs to your corporate website...
Looks like working right now. What are you trying to share?
Yeah. Currently there is only YouTube music, YouTube and Spotify. But it's extendable and I hope we will add more services soon. And will be happy with any contributions by the way.
I’d look into itertools. It’s built in to python. 
Just write a new top-level comment (a reply to your own post) with details.
You'd use the standard calculus volume of revolution integral with a twist. Instead of an infinitessimal step size of *dx* you'll have a finite delta-x. So V = integral( 2pi r(y) x dx ) where the y axis is the radial direction and the x is the symmetry axis. Note if r(y) = constant the formula will give the volume of a cylinder as expected. You can't do an integral over pixels so would sum V ~= sum( 2 pi r(y) x delta-x ) Although you might want to use a better integral approximation formula. Dealing with the xoordinate system not being aligned to the pixel grid is an exercise for the reader :p. Gotta leave some homework for you.
Trying to make a code that changes a 32 bit entry from string, into four 8 digit strings, then adds those strings up and prints an IP address. It's my final program for my intro class. Could use some help if anyone is available.

This is amazing, I'm so excited to take part in it!
I'm not really sure what i'm looking at. What kind of language is it? how does the syntax for it work? Can you actually compute programs using it? I'm not trying to be critical, I'm just curious as to what it is, i'm having some difficulty understanding it.

Too much homework for a rookie..lol 
A few weeks ago I learned the surprising reason why some of our engineers kept coming in on Saturdays and Sundays, only to sign out a few minutes later. Some of our more modern DSP hardware have fancy HTTP interfaces that are mainly intended to be interacted with as websites. As in they connect to a REST endpoint eventually, but the API is undocumented -- and almost completely unreachable from the command line. They were coming in for five minutes on weekends literally to click a button on a webpage! I wrote a rough and dirty shell script last week that submitted those POST requests directly from command line, and spent the last week writing a client-side API that communicates with a big menangerie of hardware devices over various protocols (serial, http) via a common interface. At the same time it's one of the first projects I've been rigorously adhering to TDD principles, which makes developing the app a lot more fun (among other things)! My workflow has been gamified.
Not the best but functional from string import ascii_uppercase from itertools import product def f(n=2): result = [] for rep in range(1, n+1): result += [x for x in map(''.join, product(ascii_uppercase, repeat=rep))] return result
interesting, although why `get_nnn` when you can access those properties directly in python?
Hah, okay cool, looks like a stack based assembly language with set/add/sub/mul/div/color/circle? That "v" opcode is just setting the stack at i+1 to a literal value at i+2, right? It's pretty neat. If you were to expand on this, I'd make it so you could reference addresses on the stack and lookup values, where it takes the "pointer" at i+1, I'd add a set of jump instructions like jmp jgt jlt jnez jez etc and have it check the value at i+1. Since values are 8 bit, you could have an opcode to output an ascii char too. If you want to get crazy, you could make a toy language that compiles to this bytecode as well... that'd be a fun exercise in compiler programming. You'd want to have conditional jumps for sure for that. 
Hah, okay cool, looks like a "dict based" assembly language with set/add/sub/mul/div/color/circle? It's pretty neat. If you were to expand on this, I'd add a set of jump instructions like jmp jgt jlt je jne and then you could check if one variable is bigger than a literal or another variable, and jump to a label. Since values seem to be 8 bit (the result is % 256?), you could have an opcode to output an ascii char too. If you want to get crazy, you could make a toy language that compiles to this bytecode as well... that'd be a fun exercise in compiler programming. You'd want to have conditional jumps for sure for that.
This solution relies on the fact that tuples sort first by the first element, then by the second: &gt;&gt;&gt; lst = "A AB BA C E PG AD BT WG".split() &gt;&gt;&gt; lst ['A', 'AB', 'BA', 'C', 'E', 'PG', 'AD', 'BT', 'WG'] &gt;&gt;&gt; sorted(lst, key=lambda x: (len(x), x)) ['A', 'C', 'E', 'AB', 'AD', 'BA', 'BT', 'PG', 'WG']
What have you tried so far? 
What kind of document is this being entered into? A word file? PDF? A webpage? Payroll software? Worst case scenario you can automate the mouse movements and key strokes to get this done – [here](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/chapter18/)'s a guide (but there's probably an easier way).
[https://cpy.pt/d8R5nFUR](https://cpy.pt/d8R5nFUR) So without my addition function, I have successfully separated the strings. But after adding my function, I'm having all sorts of name errors and positional arguments regarding my string.
SKlearn is the standard library: [https://scikit-learn.org/stable/](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/). There are a few nice tutorials there, this would be a good start.
The first question that comes to mind is - what format does your form come in? Is it a Word document? If so, you might be interested in the concept of a "mail merge". You can programmatically create the data you want in Excel (e.g. one row per form, so just a lot of copy-pasting and formulas) and then designate certain fields in a Word doc to auto-fill based on the name of each column. One place to start is here: [https://support.office.com/en-gb/article/mail-merge-using-an-excel-spreadsheet-858c7d7f-5cc0-4ba1-9a7b-0a948fa3d7d3](https://support.office.com/en-gb/article/mail-merge-using-an-excel-spreadsheet-858c7d7f-5cc0-4ba1-9a7b-0a948fa3d7d3) &amp;#x200B; Of course, I'd also have to ask - is it sane to submit 12,000 different forms? Is there actually someone in your company that will go through all 12k forms and approve them individually? If so, that's nuts and I don't envy them.
Very interesting reply. Thanks! I'll check out Pocketsphinx and DeepSpeech. I'm interested in machine learning, but haven't really got into it yet. Oh and your link didn't work it's voice.mozilla.org :P DeepSpeech looks confusing to get into. Could just be me. Maybe i'll find something on youtube or somewhere that'll tell me how to set it up and use the speech recognition. 
Oh haha forgot about the ORG thing, I have a very good presentation bookmarked on my computer, once I get home, I'll make sure to link you that. It covers everything from using it, to training your own models. 
Nice. Thanks!
Yes, this is easily doable with python! But as others have commented, if you want guidance, we need detailed information
Yes. Basically, everything you do by hand can be automated. But maybe it would be easier to settle it otherwise. I mean, it's not really about the missed meals, it's about compensation. And since it's not exceptional (12 people not one, and years not days), maybe your company just needs a better process for that. Automating the forms once will only hide the problem but will not make it go away.
Getter and setter aren't bad. But he should use the @property decorator for it.
Also: &gt; Racist Django ticket rejection (ticket was to add format support for Puerto Rico) You might want to read the ticket thread there. Here, I'll quote you that "racist" "rejection": &gt; Changed 8 years ago by Ramiro Morales &gt; Resolution: → invalid &gt; Status: new → closed &gt; Django currently has no Puerto Rico translation/format support. Maybe you are using files provided by another Django-based project (in that case you can reporte this to its maintainers) or locally created file (in which case you can edit the file yourself)?. &gt; &gt; Of course, we would gladly add such a translation if anyone contributes one in good shape to Django. --- &gt; Changed 8 years ago by Roberto Rosario &gt; Resolution: invalid &gt; Status: closed → reopened &gt; &gt; Replying to ramiro: &gt;&gt; Django currently has no Puerto Rico translation/format support.

The formats.py file attached here was create by myself by copying django/conf/locale/es/formats.py and editing it to provide the missing format support for es-PR locale, as for translation/i18n support the general 'es' translation is adequate for Puerto Rico, no specific 'es-PR' translation is needed. &gt; &gt; Maybe the ticked title is what's wrong, a more appropriate title should be: "Include specific localization support for Puerto Rico 'es-PR'" --- &gt; Changed 8 years ago by Ramiro Morales &gt; Triage Stage: Unreviewed → Accepted
And also: &gt; Roberto mocked and drug related comment in the official Django Software Foundation mailing list. Board members sweep the incident under the rug. Very next public message in the thread, from someone who's both a Django committer and (at the time) member of the DSF Board of Directors: &gt; We respectfully ask all users of this email list not to engage in discussions of this kind about individuals. It's not the place for it. So that's three of your points quickly and easily debunked, two using nothing more than *clicking the links you yourself provided*. If I were someone just popping by to read this thread for context, and saw that, I might think twice about trusting what you say.

You probably shouldn't leave your sticky notes up with personal information on them like people's email addresses when you record a YouTube video. In the EU that'd be a GDPR violation.
&gt; ​ &gt; &gt; Of course, I'd also have to ask - is it sane to submit 12,000 different forms? Is there actually someone in your company that will go through all 12k forms and approve them individually? If so, that's nuts and I don't envy them. Let's wait for post "Someone in my department made 12k requested for missing meal allowance. It is possible to write in Python program to process those requests?" :D
&gt;There is no way to back date the food allowance request form to automatically have these employee receive backpay for the weeks/months/years that they have not been receiving this allowance I would just conctact administration or someone responsible and ask for better solution. It'll be actually easy to fill 12k form using Python but I think it's wrong solution to this problem. You can always 'threaten' them by saing "either allow filling one missing meal form for span of dates OR I will just make 12k requests". 
Hey, I'm about to go to bed but real quick. I can tell you worked at this but you're overthinking it a bit. At the same time I know how it goes because I remember being a CS student and not really being shown the "right" way to do it. Here's how I would do it. We need fixed-sized chunks of a binary array. I like to use a recipe called grouper from the itertools docs: &gt;&gt;&gt; def grouper(iterable, n, fillvalue=None): 2 "Collect data into fixed-length chunks or blocks" 3 # grouper('ABCDEFG', 3, 'x') --&gt; ABC DEF Gxx" 4 args = [iter(iterable)] * n 5 return zip_longest(*args, fillvalue=fillvalue) Usage: &gt;&gt;&gt; grouper(s, 8) &lt;itertools.zip_longest object at 0x7ff58b4a3f98&gt; It's a generator, so to view its contents, convert it to a list first: &gt;&gt;&gt; list(grouper(s, 8)) [('0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0'), ('0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0'), ('0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0'), ('0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '1')] To make 4 8-bit strings from the components: &gt;&gt;&gt; [''.join(octet) for octet in grouper(s,8)] ['00000000', '00000000', '00000000', '00000001'] Note that you can give `int` a base argument to convert binary strings to decimal ints: &gt;&gt;&gt; int("1000", base=2) 8 And putting all of that together, we can express the entire procedure in a single line: &gt;&gt;&gt; sum(int(''.join(octet),base=2) for octet in grouper(s,8)) 1 Let me know if this makes sense and if not, why not! If there's a step you're not clear on let me know and I'll try to explain it better.

Wouldn't it be easier to fill out a single form and then write in a 'see attached' note for the date/time of the missed meal, and then attach the list of the occurrences to it?
While technically possible, it'll probably get you in trouble. Who is going to review and approve 12k individual requests? Speak to whoever is responsible and negotiate a compromise. If there is a food allowance request form, and the employees did not submit it, then why should they receive backpay? You should make HRs life as easy as possible, or they'll probably just say 'No'.

Sure, I checked it. :-) Well, this is exactly what I do at the moment, as it seems the only way so far. But having few classes in the module would be quite better. It is OK(ish) to have like [items.py](https://items.py) and [users.py](https://users.py) but what if I have different sort of users, so then I end up with like [pizzausers.py](https://pizzausers.py), [spaghettiusers.py](https://spaghettiusers.py) and [lasagneusers.py](https://lasagneusers.py) instead of just [users.py](https://users.py) and three classes in there. &amp;#x200B; Any plans on this? I would do a PR tho, but have to try if I can find some extra time for this. Thanks for the reply anyway. :-)

Well I just made a transparent dancing spongebob overlay on my screen. That's a start. If you'd like the code let me know. lol
I think it would help to see the form you have to fill out, and then where (website?) to get the information on dates received and hire date. Then it can be done in 5 minutes :)
Pretty sure the limit for python is 11.9k
Hi guys. Whole plug-in is written in Python. For generative algorithms and math numpy is used, for image processing OpenCV and for GUI PyQt. It works pretty fast. Everyone told me I have to use C++ for 3D graphics, but looks like Python is amazing even for these kind of tasks

Awesome work you got there. How many hours does it take you to build the plugin if you don't mind me asking.
Thank You! I've been making it for 2 years now. About 20 min per day on average. I cannot do it more than that, because I have 9-5 job :)
I understand the event loop and coroutines now, but what is about asyncio xD?
This is super impressive. Good stuff man!
In this case it means that asyncio is (in common) event loop plus coroutines.
You might want to take a look at what we are building at https://snips.ai, it is running 100% on-device (laptop, iOS, Android, Raspberry Pi 3) and private-by-design, it works for english, french, german, japanese, spanish, italian, and more coming!
Thanks!
Well you could use queues and stuff.

This is so impressive! I'd love to know what you used for that 3D render, because I've tried made anything like that. Is it OpenCV? I've used OpenCV for 2D image processing but never 3D.
Great work man, you have a exporter/importer or plugin for [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) or/and [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) also in your pipeline?
It's a maya plugin.
