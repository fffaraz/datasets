I guess you are missing the point. Your Readme says "Create an account in Way2SMS", yet you can't create an account on way2sms unless you have a +91 number which is India, the registration form has a field where you have to select your city from a list of cities in India. Definitely not usable outside of India.
In first code example, I think the second conjunct should be pd.isnull(west['Rejection_Reason']) instead of west['Rejection_Reason'] == 'NaN' if OP is trying to return rows where the value is NaN (and assuming that the value really is null and not the string "NaN").
I was just using what he was using. It could be numpy.nan. The point is that it’s df[col] == value.

Aah ok thank you. :)
Yes....
Depends on what the topic is. You can always briefly talk about the history, what companies use Python on a large scale, what the technical differences are between C++ and Python, etc.
The posts on http://treyhunner.com/ are really good! 
Well good point ... But Python was not built for heavy computation... It's a language which puts readability at a high standard in the purpose of rapid development ... If you worry about execution speed you can definitely still use C 
This is epic 🙏
Yes we all know What's the fun in that
I decide on the topic. I plan to be something like "why Python". I can't really filter what is important for someone who isn't very good at programming.
I generally do .query as well. Another decent way would be numpy.logical_and
First of all, let's not forget that TDD and unit testing are not the same. Many devs use unit testing (and other forms of testing) without the TDD approach. i.e. Writing the code in mind and then the tests that test the code. TDD forces you to plan the logic in advance and write the expected behavior (test) and only then the minimal code to make the test pass. The first approach doesn't guarantee that the code is testable, and writing tests could be difficult and might require refactoring your code but without the safety net the tests give you, how would you know that you didn't break anything? I do TDD, but I don't adhere to the 3 laws religiously. In my experience, there are some shades of grey where the 2 approaches work very well side-by-side.
I would go with python expressiveness, dynamic typing, ease of use etc. All the things that are different from c/c++, that makes python awesome
best, fo what?
Ah that's fair enough - looking again I see it is not consistent in the question (the OP writes both NaN and 'NaN'). 
First: `import` statements should _always_ be at the top of you module. This should also fix your pesky name issue. Second: loggers are cheap. Unless it’s absolutely necessary to have a module-level logger, considered initializing loggers within your classes or functions. This way, they’re not in the global name-space and you don’t have that issue to begin with.
What if you want multiple while loops to run at once?
Use generators?
**/**r/learnpython
There is a learning sources section in this sub. Use it.
I did this recently and started with the 'import this' Easter egg to frame the python mindset, then moved into highlighting a few handy features - with, enumerate(), f-strings, dynamic typing. focus on speed/ease/clarity of development. 
Yea I guess so, I usually use threading for more complex operations that require some kind of loop to run, in case I want lots of them running at once
When starting out in a language it can be very overwhelming to start working on larger projects. What I suggest you do is make a list of things that you need to learn to do the project and then start working on them one-by-one. For example: * Working with Twitter API * Pre-processing the text from the tweets * Sentiment analysis(this is up to you to decide to cosnume someone elses model or create your own I would also watch as many videos and read as many blogs as I can about the topic and combine what you think is the best attributes of each into your project. Best of luck!
Actually yeah, I can see how that can be helpful and also time-saving. This and the use of threads for IO, as mentioned in the other comments, I totally didn't consider these two scenarios.
To be more verbose. This sub is for so called advanced python, mostly lectures/articles, projects, packages and core issues. Beginners should use r/learnpython for starting steps and "How to" questions. 
Jake Vanderplas has some great articles about mini-projects or exploration of advanced python features http://jakevdp.github.io
Brevity. Compare doing some simple string operations, like opening a file, reading the contents, doing a replacement, and writing to a different file. The difference should be 1-3 lines of Python vs. 20 or 30 for C#. It's even more pronounced if you add error handling. Then talk about scaling that up to a real project size and highlight the time savings. Python's main strength is in the programmer's time spent writing.
thanks
 Quality content. Thanks for the link.
given that python classes don't have a rigid structure declared in advance, you would be writing `self`s out the ass anyway, because the language won't read your mind and you will have to differenciate between x the object attribute and x the variable (self.x vs x) by hand. Remove selfs from the signature? Miniscule gain, given the above problem, with a ton of non-trivial complications. Given the dynamic nature of the language, monkeypatching and shit, the line between implicit and explicit would be blurry. Take a plain function with 3 args. Should 1 arg disappear magically, to be replaced with an implicit self, just because you bind it to a class on the fly? Methods are pretty much functions in class namespace anyway `Class.method(instance, *args, **kwargs)` so explicit self actually keeps it simple and consistent. 
Not sure that asyncio has "taken over" for I/O. If you're writing an IO-centric server application maybe. But you've got to go all-in on the non-blocking model of development. I find threading is perfect for simpler use cases. Let's say you're trying to speed up a single function which makes multiple network requests in parallel. A `ThreadPoolExecutor` is a wonderful tool... Instead of ``` import requests urls = [f'https://example.com/{i}' for i in range(10)] responses = [requests.get(url) for url in urls] ``` You write ``` from concurrent import futures with futures.ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor: responses = executor.map(requests.get, urls) ``` Asyncio feels like overkill for this.
It's also important to note that the GIL is an implementation-specific feature of CPython and not a part of the language itself meaning that other implementations don't necessarily need to have it. PyPy for example doesn't have GIL.
yes it does
It makes code faster!
Thanks! I will check this out today and get back with results. 
... yes, multiprocessing, but if you start reading about the Global Interpreter Lock restrictions common to Python, you get the impression that Python's multiprocessing has serious built in latency because of GIL.
You can manually release the Gil in cython (nogil keyword) and other compiled extensions. So libraries like numpy can potentially do that
Interactivepython.org was helpful for me starting out. 
Examples of times I've used threads: * To spawn a task I want to run asynchronously, like checking a comment for spam * To speed up io-bound workloads, like spidering a website or multipart uploads * To start a server process using popen and allow the main thread to continue executing * Doing work in gui, handling events, doing work without blocking the UI (update a progress bar)
python is all about namespace ([zen](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/)), so I'm not sure what you're trying to achieve here. But an easy solution would be to import the logger from `helper.py` as different name: `from helper import l as not_scriprts_l` 
It seems that your comment contains 1 or more links that are hard to tap for mobile users. I will extend those so they're easier for our sausage fingers to click! [Here is link number 1](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/) - Previous text "zen" ---- ^Please ^PM ^/u/eganwall ^with ^issues ^or ^feedback! ^| ^[Delete](https://reddit.com/message/compose/?to=FatFingerHelperBot&amp;subject=delete&amp;message=delete%20dx0lgmv) 
&gt;But Python was not built for heavy computation... Eurgh. So sick of these comments. Languages evolve, just because in 1994 that wasn't Python doesn't mean it can't be now. Pythons performance story in 2018 is so sad and is only going to get worse as core counts ramp up.
"Think Python" and "A Byte of Python" are good books for beginners. "A Byte of Python" is a free ebook available online. Just Google it :) Happy learning :)
http://scipy.github.io/old-wiki/pages/ParallelProgramming#Threads &gt; while numpy is doing an array operation, python also releases the GIL. Thus if you tell one thread to do: ``` &gt;&gt;&gt; print "%s %s %s %s and %s" %( ("spam",) *3 + ("eggs",) + ("spam",) ) &gt;&gt;&gt; A = B + C &gt;&gt;&gt; print A ``` &gt;During the print operations and the % formatting operation, no other thread can execute. But during the A = B + C, another thread can run - and if you've written your code in a numpy style, much of the calculation will be done in a few array operations like A = B + C. Thus you can actually get a speedup from using multiple threads. 
It has been some time since I last used `ipython` so I may be wrong. If you mean regular `ipython` that you run from console, then these are very much different. `ipython` is designed to work as as an interactive environment wheras `picon` works from the shell command line. It may be easier to compare editor integration of `picon` with `ipython` notebook interface. In this case, `picon` can be considered as a much simpler alternative to the notebook interface. It is limited by a text only interface (no plots, markdown, or latex), and it doesn't have an option to run individual blocks within the code. It depends on your use case I guess. I consider `picon` as a tool to play with the language for newcomers so I probably wouldn't use it as a replacement for `ipython` for serious scientific programming.
I commented below without actually reading through your code. You have some errors in your snippets, but `l` wont be overwritten since you use `import helper`, thus in order to use helper 'l' you should use `helper.l`. 
Just to get familiar with testing and training a neural network. I entered a competition on kaggle and tried to get the most accurate outcome results for Pima diabetes data. (whether the person had diabetes or not based on blood sugar, insulin, BMI and a bunch of other variables)
It is not a replacement for threads. Shared mutable memory is a wonderful thing for performance if done right.
Most of your time is spent waiting for IO. The GIL is not held during this time.
Wow, could have sworn PyPy doesn't have GIL, I guess I was wrong. Thank you for that, maybe it's a good idea to check before posting.

What is your directory structure, and how are you setting up your top-level logger? Can you perhaps link to a github gist or the actual code? The team I work on has a convention for module-level loggers in our applications, and I rarely see this issue. Additionally, I recognize not everything needs to be an object or class, but you could initialize the logger within the function as well. Loggers are singletons, which means that every call to `getLogger` returns the same root instance of the logger. The only magic that function applies is re-naming it for the variable life-cycle.
Do these processes or threads need to communicate? I avoid implementing multiprocessing in code by using external services like RabbitMQ for communication and Supervisor for process management.

I check but the python2 path doesn't appear, is like it never had be installed. My pc ever run python3. The problem keep showing the same error "modules not found"
IronPython and Jython are GIL-free.

r/learnpython is under utilized.
OK, that's good to know. But by "computational tasks" does that include large array operations? Here is why I ask: One of the stackoverflow discussions has this comment taken from the NumPy C API documentation: "...as long as no object arrays are involved, the GIL is released ..." and I have interpreted that to mean that you can't do this with array operations. By the way, it sounds to me like the way you are verifying this is by monitoring core activity rather than through a latency test of some kind. That actually is quite convincing to me ... if 6 cores are running at 80% and above then multiprocessing must be working. Have you run latency comparisons of any kind (running a test task as sequential and then redesigning and running as parallel)?
I think most spherical harmonic functions break down at that high an l. Have you considered using semiclassical approximations for them? You should be able to find expressions for those in angular momentum textbooks (for example Brink and Satchler, or Zare).
If you make a copy of the array and pass that to the new process, you should be fine. If you ever pass an array by reference to a new process, then yeah, that's going to have lock issues.
Sorry not pushed it to git yet. Essentially what i am trying to achive is that the log states which module it was generated from so somthing like the following output INFO:__main__:Start of logging INFO:helper:Logging within the helper classs INFO:__main__:End of logging. if i use "l" to define a logger in the helper and script (so they have a different name) the script will overwrite it in by above example (due the the helper then overwriting "l"). if import was done first then the script will overwrite my helper module logger name (variable l). I could simple rename the helper variable, but i trying to work out another way without doing that. 
multiprocessing is &lt;3. In one of my applications, I sped up an input file reading process from several minutes to a few seconds thanks to multiprocessing.
As others have said, generally when numpy or another library calls compiled code, they explicitly release the GIL. So imagine you had two threads running some python code, concurrently, but not in parallel. If one thread reached a numpy operation, like adding two large arrays etc., it would 'release' the GIL, allowing the other thread to work in parallel while that operation is happening. Once the operation is over the GIL is reaquired but without that release both threads would've had to wait for the operation to finish. I think there is a very slight overhead to this, which is why cython and numba leave it as an option. But if the majority of the computation is numeric (e.g. most scientific code) then you can essentially achieve normal threaded parallelism.
This is very dangerous to our democracy.
What OS are you using? In Mac, you can use `afplay`. You might try alternatives to gTTS, that doesn't create an audio file, such as TTSx or google_speech. BTW, in Mac, I just use `say` command.
list slicing! being able to do list[3:5] or list[:-1] or list[::-1] is amazing
Mpmath is providing sensible answers it seems for all values I’ve tested. Used 100 random test angles and ran it in a couple of loops lest l up to 250 for all |m|&gt;=l. But my ‘test’ was just seeing if it produced a number as opposed to nan and that it’s absolute value wasn’t blowing up (stayed below 10). Will look into approximations but I’m not sure about them since this is calculating eigen values and functions and my basis set is a bunch of hydrogen like (Rydberg) wave functions. Other people doing similar stuff have used mathematica but I want to stick with python. 
Where are you setting up your logger? You should only call `setupLogger`, `basicConfig`, or `dictConfig` in your *main*. Calling it elsewhere will result in over-writing the root logger every time, which can also re-write the name permanently.
I don't have the time to dig into your code now but something that I'm using for sound is to launch ffmpeg in a thread using subprocess.Popen and route the stdin to a buffer (or tempfile)for processing. You might also be able to do what you need using PyAudio. Good luck!
Yes it does. I created @FreeWtr a bot that advocates for filtered tap water over bottled. 
&gt;But to make statements like "Threads are often unnecessary" is a bit absurd. If it was restated as "People often implement threading unnecessarily" I could agree with that. How else do you interpret that statement? Because to me both mean the same thing.
you mean Nano (XRB) former Railblocks?
Yup
Get a book. Work through book. 
Tbh, neither python nor mathematica are great options for Rydberg atoms (did my PhD on them too!). Fortran or C would be more efficient. I know the routines I have in my codes fail for high l, otherwise I would have just sent those to you. I suggest you look around for fortran code that you can compile into a python module with f2py. Also, you can look at the ARC code written by people in my old group, and see what they use. https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010465517301972
If everybody is a superhero, no one is a superhero
at first i set it up in the base script. issue was the output on the helper log looked like it came from the main script. INFO:__name__:Start of logging INFO:helper:Logging within the helper classs INFO:__name__:End of logging. vs INFO:__name__:Start of logging INFO:helper:Logging within the helper classs INFO:__name__:End of logging.
CPython can release the GIL inside a c-module. If you're truly worried about performance, you'd use python as "glue" and write a few c modules to do the actual "heavy lifting". Anything you'd want multiple threads to do for computational reasons is probably best not done in actual python. Threads in python, however, ARE great for IO bound reasons.
whooooaaa fucking awesome, if it isnt too much to ask, anything you could share
Nice try Russia

How did you speed up reading a file with multiprocessing? Open it on every process and scan to different parts?
I can vouch that I've processed the same array on many processes without copying it specifically to each process. Works if you don't write to the array. I think the multiprocessing uses copy-on-write semantics anyways to make this safe.
thank you !
thank you!
[You can share memory between processes](https://docs.python.org/2/library/multiprocessing.html#module-multiprocessing.sharedctypes).
If you're writing a GUI app and want the GUI to remain responsive while you perform some long process, threads are helpful.

They have an experimental branch that tries to implement STM, so they can remove the GIL. But I think they suspended development on it a while ago. 
Sweet! Spread the good word, plastics are insufferable pollutants that hurt the earth that humans have created. Thanks for helping educate others to reduce our pollution before nature reduces us to save life on earth. 
I have used it for schedulers calling other programs. The GIL is released when a child process is launched.
Thanks, I'll take a look into those two options.
Just had a quick look on my phone. Looks useful so will definitely check it out properly later. For what I’m currently doing (Rydberg molecules with multiple perturbers) python has been good fine to use until I put n&gt;86 and then the problem i mentioned arises. But going forward I know I need something more (last night was looking up the pros and cons of c vs fortran). Do you have any pointers of which might be better? Do they both integrate as easily with python?

Your problem is that you're being obliged to use a language you don't like; a typescript alternative isn't going to fix that. That's an issue to address with your manager, and to keep in mind as you look for new jobs.
Probably something like that. mmap the file with MAP_SHARED, then fork off the other processes. Each process then reads a different area of the mapped file.

Oh yeah, Python is definitely "best" for writing an OS. Best for embedded programming, too! Let me fire up that Python interpreter on my attiny85! Garbage survey and garbage article.
Tried this out, can’t get Tkinter to run on Py 3.6.3 , help? 
Personally, I am running python 2.7.1 on Mac OSX El Capitan. Did you look at the source code on [Github](https://github.com/Fidel-Willis/TwitterBot)?
Yes I’ve tried everything but the code won’t work, it will only work up to the process of following back the users who follow you , past that point there are many errors 
Have you tried to create a separate script just for Tkinter to make sure it works properly? Did you include root.mainloop() At the end of your code to make the GUI window appear?
Lol, I'm the manager, I choose Python.
Yeah i installed py 2.6 and ran the code and the window then appeared, I typed in the account codes and filled out what showed up in the window and nothing happened/: 
I think this was the only successful removal of the GIL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNBKWuM-Lu8
Did you press the submit button and make sure to link it to your mainFunction(). This function is what should hold all of your code for handling retweets, replies, favorites, etc. Almost all of your code should be in here except for setting up and packing your GUI window. 
It's a joke people.
Thanks for your help both - I’m on Windows atm I’ll have a go at these and keep you posted once I tried 
Quite so, I had to do a triple take on that name and then a bit of googling, just to make sure this is indeed the same tabloid magazine and not a just a weird lapse in my memory. I guess... good on them for putting out quality stuff.
Random idea, build your presentation with ipython and present out of it. This will make the presentation a bit more interactive and hands on. If you got it setup on a vps you can give out a qr code at the start for people that want to follow on their device.
Small example snippet please!
That's interesting; I see Atlantic articles linked fairly frequently, and I think of them as a quality source, with long-form, thoughtful pieces, often about international issues. Wikipedia mentions that it was "reformatted in the early 21st century" - were you familiar with it before that? (I certainly wasn't)
Just be aware it gets passed via pickle.
make a RAT
The [mmap module documentation](https://docs.python.org/dev/library/mmap.html) has a number of examples, but if you want one specifically with JSON (not sure if the formatting is going to work here): import json import mmap with open('foo.json', 'r+b') as example_file: with mmap.mmap(example_file.fileno(), 0) as mapped_file: print(json.load(mapped_file))
If anyone is thinking of actually running this or similar code, you might want to consider the Twitter rules regarding [automation](https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/twitter-automation) of likes: &gt; Automated likes: You may not like Tweets in an automated manner. However regarding automation of retweets: &gt; Automated Retweets: Provided you comply with all other rules, you may Retweet or Quote Tweet in an automated manner for entertainment, informational, or novelty purposes. Automated Retweets often lead to negative user experiences, and bulk, aggressive, or spammy Retweeting is a violation of the Twitter Rules.
I think you're confusing shmem and queues. Queues will pickle objects back and forth and work with Pyhton-level objects. Shared memory primitives use actual shared memory segments, but are limited to ctypes types.

As everyone has said, mostly IO. 1) Process some data while more data is downloading 2) Play an audio file without having to wait for it to finish playing for the script to resume 3) Having GUIs remain responsive while processing data 4) Similar to above, showing matplotlib figures while code executes in the background &gt;even if we use threads in python, our program will take the same time if we just use a single thread due to GIL. This is only true if both threads are CPU bound. If one thread is spending 50% of the time waiting around for disk write or network IO the two threads will finish with time to spare over a single thread
Hi, I went through your code. Is it possible by any chance that you can share source code of Noisy Text Correction application. I have been trying to implement this but cannot get all the values right by replacing '~'
This is for time independent elliptic PDEs using relaxation methods. Jacobi initially, then the Gauss-Seidel method. However this problem keeps coming up again and again. I pretty much exclusively use python for computational physics so I'm often doing this type of thing.

I do not understand what you mean. If you have information about neighbors, building the matrix must cost as much as building the stencils
That's because they are not implementing every little detail of Python. It is easy to actually remove GIL, the problem though is that it will make python much much slower. The reason for it is that Python has some mechanisms that require them to be single threaded. Large one is reference counting and the way binary modules are done, there are also some details about Python's magic methods for objects, but I don't remember the details. IronPython and JPython provide subset of Python functionality so they can work without GIL. BTW: there is work happening to remove GIL, and seems like right now the idea is to provide a compile flag that changes API in exchange to have disabled GIL. Seems like a fair compromise. Larry Hastings is leading that effort and he is providing updates about that in his talks titled Gilectomy
And I used it to create [@assaultwords](http://twitter.com/assaultwords), the bot that makes everything scarier! Tweepy is awesome.
Also, if your data is a matrix X you can design your differential operator more efficiently as A * X + X *B + C * X * D with four small sparse matrices, without flattening X.

Like "i before e except after c" not all such rules are hard and fast, including putting an s on an uncountable noun. When to follow or bend these rules can be subtle and debatable, but I'm perfectly comfortable swimming in the murky waters of language.
Pygame uses avbin. Support for avbin is long-gone.
Ok, with a bit of work, I can use popen and ffplay. That seems straight-forward. Thanks!
How does the bot work?
When I run the python script in the terminal a GUI window pops up and asks you to type in a search query and number of tweets you'd like to interact with. Then if you want to favorite, retweet, reply or follow a user. Then you press submit and it carries out the function you selected on Twitter. 
Oh, I see. I was mistaken about the term "object arrays." I thought that it might mean that an array created within numpy was a kind of numpy "object." So I was interpreting the documentation wrong. Thanks for the insight. 
Thank you. This and other comments on this page clarify a lot. And the "iterate over all elements ... N-dimensional array" is precisely what I do most of the time. This is very encouraging (I haven't tried threading yet).
Your example is very clear. What an education I getting today! Thank you.

Can you show me an example of how you'd do this so it would only run Sun - Wed 12pm - 10pm? Thanks in advance! 
&gt; Lol, I'm the manager, I choose Python. I'm being "forced" in the sense that It was the best tool for the job. It sounds like you are a manager who either doesn't communicate well or you don't take accountability for your decisions.
Gave it in front of local high school students in an attempt to make them interested in programming. Seems like it worked, got a lot of question afterward and telegram messages.
I thought we have LISP for it.
Why do you need to test the large arrays? Do they have a different structure, fundamentally, than the small ones? What exactly are you attempting to *verify* with these tests? Keep in mind that unit tests are, in essence, intended to verify that a given input can be transformed to a given output. If these arrays have the same dimensionality and patterns of usage whether they have a thousand members or ten million members, you only really need to test the former. Basically a little more detail on precisely what behavior you're testing may help.
What IDE is this?
&gt; only run Sun - Wed 12pm - 10pm? Try a crontab entry like: [Minute] [hour] [Day_of_the_Month] [Month_of_the_Year] [Day_of_the_Week] [command] 0 12-22 * * 4,5,6,7 $HOME/bin/myjob.py &gt;&gt; $HOME/tmp/out 2&gt;&amp;1 Crontab guru[ says that means](https://crontab.guru/#0_12-22_*_*_4,5,6,7): &gt; “At minute 0 past every hour from 12 through 22 on Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.” Try that. Cron can be a bit finicky at times so check with the cron gurus if you have difficulty with setting it up and running it. Usually, the problem is that cron is running from a different folder than the program location so try running it by hand after doing, "cd /" and run the script using the full path to the script. 
I think we could definitely afford to do unit testing on smaller arrays, for sure. But even then, we would have to find some way to produce arrays of ~100 elements for the unit testing. The reason we will need to test against arrays of higher dimensionality is because we have a variety of files we are processing and the new files have new array structures. Previously, all that arrays were one or two dimensions, so nothing too bad to manually write into a test array. The next file type to be included has seven dimensions, which would be more troublesome to manually enter. I hope that helps
This is emacs with spacemacs-light theme
That's okay, that's totally legitimate. I just wanted to make sure you weren't trying to test these large arrays "to make sure we can handle them" or something, which is more in the realm of profiling, rather than unit testing ( and is also a function of the hardware you're running it on; "can my machine load 25 gigs into memory" is answered differently on a developer's chromebook than it is on a dedicated high power EC2 instance ). So you're looking to serialize a "known-good" instance of your parsed data, and use that to compare against your implementation of the parser? First, *do not* use pickle. Especially not for this, but I'd go as far as to say EVER. There is a lot of literature on why pickle [is](http://michael-rushanan.blogspot.com/2012/10/why-python-pickle-is-insecure.html) [bad](https://www.benfrederickson.com/dont-pickle-your-data/). Most articles focus on the security flaws but another reason is that pickle is *brittle*. Renaming classes, moving them from one module to another, and a lot of other "trivial" changes to your code can render your pickle'd values completely unusable. This can be very bad in your use case; you're probably going to have an evolving codebase that will change a lot over time. Unless you very meticulously version your pickle values and match them to specific commits/tags, it's possible that your serialized "known-good" values will be garbage data. My suggestion is to use something like ProtoBuf. Ostensibly, protobuf is designed for over-the-wire transmission of data in a binary format. This is not its only use, however. protobuf can be very useful for "cold storage" of data; it is forwards-compatible and versioned, meaning that changes to the code ( within reason ) will not break your ability to deserialize your data. As an added bonus, it's a binary format so it's going to end up about as compact as it possibly can be. Even if you never intend to transmit this data over the wire, a protobuf based storage solution will let you save this data and reload it more or less in perpetuity. As an alternative, you could also use JSON. It's a very flexible data format so long as your data can be expressed in maps ( dicts ), arrays ( lists ), ints, floats, bools, and strings. It will end up being bulky, however, and the textual nature will add overhead in loading it back into your application. How much, I cannot say, and it may be that your data is small or easy enough to parse that the difference between it and protobuf is negligible. Maybe try both solutions and do some profiling to determine which is faster. I'd lean towards protobuf, however, as it's more..."forward thinking", so to speak. Maybe one day you WILL need to transmit this data over the network. Boom! You already have a data format ready to go! I hope I was able to offer some ideas and insight. Don't hesitate to ask more questions. You're getting downvoted because people probably think this belongs in /r/learnpython but it seems like a legitimate architectural question to me.

After more thought you are right of course it can be applied to any arbitrary grid. It's just that sometimes I find writing "flat code" with *vectorized* variables a little easier to understand than to express the nearest neighbor operations as a sparse matrix. Scipy does handle sparse matrix multiplication.
Yes, this is precisely what I am looking for. Thank you. I just needed to think about things in a different way.
i think the combinations() function from itertools is probably what you're looking for. 
Don't share code with images.
Ehhh not really. Basically I'm creating an add-on for a game, where basically if players are trying to find people doing this certain event, the application will match people in the same region seeking the same event.

Thank you very much for your insight. I've looked into JSON a tad, but not a ton. Definitely will give protobuf a look as well. Yes, we are looking to serialize/compress known-good data for testing purposes. Never heard that phrase before so searching that might uncover some new resources as well. 
If you dont have the book already, this stackoverflow post might be very helpful: https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/122014/what-are-the-key-points-of-working-effectively-with-legacy-code?utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_source=google_rich_qa&amp;utm_campaign=google_rich_qa http://www.netobjectives.com/system/files/WorkingEffectivelyWithLegacyCode.pdf http://www.slideshare.net/nashjain/working-effectively-with-legacy-code-presentation
No, it's an after work project. Maybe 5-10 hours a week for the past 8 months. 
A huge part of the reason I pursued python is because indentation made code more readable for me. Sure it can cause a headache for cut and paste, but very rarely and it's usually really simple to fix. I think the benefits outweigh the drawbacks! And what other language has such a good "import gravity" system?
Ah okay!
&gt; I didn’t have that issue. Have you tried opening the pac file and using a proxy listed and using in your python environment variable? &gt; &gt; no ,i did not have a try
Whats wrong with the typings module?
Google offers a similar tool with a liberal Apache 2 licence (https://github.com/google/clif). It covers std:: containers and smart pointers out of the box.
This is more of a math problem than a Python problem, though Python will help you with enumerating all the pairs. We have two groups, and we need to choose 10 individuals from each. There's only 1 way to choose 10 from a group of 10, and 12 choose 10 ways to choose 10 individuals from a group of 12. If you need to enumerate through the pairs I would pick an ordering for the men and use [``itertools.permutations``](https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.permutations) with r=10 to make a table of all the different couples you can pair off.
People who did a very derpy job designing a language, like Eich, Matzumoto, van Rossum, but then were idolized due to network effect, judging by their interviews, seem to live in this bizarro-world, where they are idolized by the worshipers and every word coming from their mouth is expected be some kind of transcendental truth... If I had a chance to ask Guido anything, I'd spend that chance playing a video game.
Why would you have it Tweet that? 
Not sure if the problem is similar: I cannot tell this from your description, but here's something based on my guess of what your problem may be. In filesystem testing one is often required to generate a lot of random data to write it to the disk, could be hundreds of Gigabytes, structured in thousands of directories and files. It isn't really humanly possible to generate this data / expected results. What is typical to do in this case is to use random with your seed and then use the same generator to make every decision about the data, like, how many sub-directories must there be, the size of files etc. This way, your test only needs to store the seed for the random, and everything else "unfolds" from it. Since random comes with some statistic properties, you would then test for those statistic properties. I.e. usually, random provided by standard library produces uniformly distributed, non-clustered values, so, in verifying your results, you wouldn't verify the matching to some expected set of values, but rather verify that your program produced statistically consistent results.
That's a totally different approach of mine but an interesting one. I mainly use lupin to build API endpoints and having the full path of the attributes hard coded in the schema won't let me reuse them. Imagine I have a `Book` model and an `Author` model. A book has an `author` attribute. In the `/authors` endpoint the attributes of the authors will be at the root of each `Author` objects. And in the `/books` endpoint it will be in a nested field of a `Book` object. If I understand how jtree works I will have to define 2 classes that inherit from `JsonClass` for the `Author` model, is that right ? What is your use case for jtree ?
A native thread for non-static language? what were you thinking man!
This is the ugliest possible way to comment code. Seriously it's barbaric. numberOfTweets = "Number of tweets you wish to interact with" for tweet in tweepy.Cursor(api.search, search).items(numberOfTweets)``` ```numberOfTweets``` is an int not a string ffs.
It depends on where you launch Python. Your current directory gets added to your `sys.path`. I'd recommend downloading the source code of some Python libraries to see how they import things. I believe that reading the source code of numpy really helped me wrap my head around imports.
Yea! I realized that for you it is about the nestedness of objects. I more imagine a "flat" case. It'd be tough to implement, but I could indeed imagine I would be able to combine it like that: class Book(JsonClass): title = Path('./title') published_at = Path('./publish_date', DateTime) class Author(JsonClass): name = Path('/author/name') books = Path('/author/books', Book) where the paths would be joined in the case the `convert_type` inherits from `JsonClass`. My case was more about indeed about working with a relatively new/unknown API which might chance. With `learn` I can quickly find a path to what I want, and with the `JsonClass` I will be notified when something is not of the correct type (or be quiet and give a `None`).

PATH is for executable scripts. If you want to use an environment variable to affect Python imports, that's PYTHONPATH.
It is very nice to read your comments and it makes me more motivated to continue studying python. I noticed nowadays that this skill is very in demand and i still don't know why a programming language (data scientist skills) needed by an engineer. I just keep studying python without a goal for how will i apply it in my work, but now that i read your comments, it gives me direction. Thanks again! 
And btw, Do you have any suggestion for resources to study Python for Engineers? For now, I'm just using Python for Beginners which focuses on data scraping/parsing. 
Wow, good job! Can you say more about this? How much time you write this and other stuff ;) I'm very interested because I wanted to make game on android too.
Did you try the code example all the way at the bottom? caller.join(other.set_index('key'), on='key') 
Thats interesting, it can be done. Never heard of that ndb.Model so thanks for posting, TIL. BTW, you can format indents, on reddit, with exactly 4 spaces: class Table(ndb.Model): x = ndb.IntegerProperty() 
pd.concat([Master_df, New_df]) does what I think you *actually* want. You will have two rows with index "Apples", which is not what you've shown in your desired result. Can you confirm if this is a mistake on your part? Because your desired data frame doesn't seem to be a possible combination of the two data frames, i.e., how would the result know which row with index "Apples" to remove?
It covers some really interesting topics such as Dash and stuff. Really helpful, thanks.
Hey khanhnathan. Thanks for the help! I do **not** want to have two rows for apples. I want values in New_df to take priority.
Do your own homework.
In that case, why doesn't combine_first() not give you what you want?
I see what you mean now. Let me think...
For this particular task, it might be. Depending on how good you are with python and how well you understand [GIL](https://wiki.python.org/moin/GlobalInterpreterLock). If you can pull off working with rather low level sockets, threads might work for. If you are not sure, you'd be better off using multiprocessing.
Doesn't combine_first() give you what you want? In [55]: Master_df.combine_first(New_df) Out[55]: color price tastey name Anise Brown NaN NaN Apples Red Low Always Avocados Black NaN Sometimes Bananas Yellow Medium NaN Berries Red High NaN
Nice one, to make a game on kivy there is a lot to do, congrats
Because you describe a task that's all about io you don't need extra processing power, just a way to parallelise the calls that just wait for new data to arrive. Therefore Threading is the better choice. As an alternative you could check an event loop like asyncio
As Brian Moore, former England rugby union international and now commentator would say, "that's dumb".
Would you like to expand on why someone would use this instead of [django-axes](https://django-axes.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)?
Bruteforce != DDoS
I think I have a solution. Push index *name* back to ordinary columns, then merge, finally set column *name* to index: master_df.reset_index().merge(new_df.reset_index(), how='outer').set_index('name') To me it appears that df.merge() doesn‘t operate on the index column at all. This appears to be strange at first, because a basic principle of pandas is that data is always associated with an index. The thought, you could merge both dataframes based on their index is false. Instead, you merge on the content of the ordinary columns only.
Axes integrates into django login system. DjBrut for manual usage into custom cases like verification code sending by email/SMS.

Sorry mate your coding style is terrible. There are no good reason to use a variable as a comment. 
Oh okay I see yes in the tutorial I shouldn't have commented like that, but it was to make it show up in the terminal in that way. In the final code that "variable/comment" is not needed.

"import antigravity"
Thank you! Found a pdf copy of the book. It seems useful.
I don't know what many of these words mean, but....designing and coding should be iterative. Design a bit, code a bit, step back and reassess frequently and repeat. Coding first with no design is just a mess. Designing first with no code makes a beautiful boat anchor.
I like making quick random things with pygame. like cellular automata. 
Take a look at [makeartwithpython.com](https://www.makeartwithpython.com/)

Sounds like a typical webapp so first choice would be Django or Flask (+ SQLAlchemy etc). What is realtime about it?
Nice video, good explanation, thanks for taking the time to do it. Small detail, we pronounce it pie-charm, which is a little easier to say. If you make any more videos, could you cross-post to /r/pycharm?
Yeap. I 1000% agree with this. If you learn an iterative approach you will succeed at any good shop.
Fair enough... i have to admit that the last time i used it was, er... yeah about 5 years ago! Oh well.

Again, thank you. Although I am aware the numpy relies upon C I am not aware of how C operates inside of numpy .. I don't know how the C-level loops work (probably because I can't code in C). This gives me a bit of an incentive to figure some of this out. Given that I am a practitioner and not a computer scientist, how C works inside of numpy and even Python for that matter is all black box for me. I appreciate the time it took to try to get my thinking right. I think it is time that I took the effort to learn a little more about C.

I'm fooling around with some ascii adventure game stuff which is pretty fun. [Take a look](https://github.com/Sam-Scheding/ascii-adventure)
An intuitive gui for visualizing 3d models using vtk. It's just so pretty. There are things like multiple formats Paraviw and VisIt don't have. There are color/fringe, deflection, and arrow/marker plots with animated gifs you can make. A hobby project, even if it sounds like work, doesn't feel like work because you can fix whatever bug you want or add whatever feature you want in whatever order you want. It's only really work when you're trying to fix a critical bug.
No opinion on implementation order, but you should test that your implementation matches the declared API with [swagger-conformance](https://pypi.org/pypi/swagger-conformance). python -m swaggerconformance 'http://example.com/api/schema.json' Leverages Hypothesis to basically fuzz your implementation, trying all kinds of data that *should* be valid (according to your spec), and reporting minimal failing examples. Incredibly easy to get started, works for an API implemented in any language - that's the point of Swagger! - and you can write more specific tests later too.
I got bored the other night and it was an Election Day. Our results are available online as a simple text file. I threw together some python that monitored just the elections I was interested in every 30 seconds and texted me when it saw a change or update in the data. It made the evening more enjoyable than sitting there refreshing a website. Build that into a scalable system that can be administered via a web page and even monetized. 
Because when I'd take it to work it was a bitch to find the IP address.

I think the key is to find something you want to make and go for it. That's how I always do projects to learn more about a language. For example in python I've made things like a D&amp;D planner and a fantasy football team generator. For D&amp;D, I needed to learn to access a database and make a GUI. For football, I needed to webscrape the player info and make an optimization algorithm to pick the best possible team. So do you have any hobbies or interests you'd like a tool for? Make that.
Love the Spotify API. Is the source public? 
I love the challenges on codefights.com.

Never even thought about that, and have yet to learn about bash... or even what XHR reqs are lol. At any rate thank you!!!
You don't need to learn about bash. XHR stands for XMLHttpRequest which is an API request which sends data between the webclient and the webserver. Despite the name, it can include xml, json, text etc..
For the first one, take a look at Django or Flask.
What's your question? Also, nobody will do your homework for you. People also won't help unless you attempt it first, so where is your code?
[removed]
The app is going to match players with each other based on similar characteristics, like region and the event type they're looking for. There can only be a maximum of six players in a group, so the current member count would need to be processed and displayed in real time. Once the group is full, it would then no longer be displayed to similar players seeking a group.

Find some cool APIs and work with them. PRAW is reddits official API and you can make some really cool reddit bots with it.

The key is to just learn good program construction and your data structures. Languages become an implementation detail at that point (unless you specifically need something a particular language excels at)

&gt; The intended behaviour here is almost equivalent to final methods in Java and normal (non-virtual) methods in C++. It really, really is not. The intended behaviour is that of `private` in Java *for the specific behaviour of inheritance*. That is, the `__` prefix exists for classes designed to be inherited, for internal methods &amp; attributes which should not be accessed by child classes, to avoid risks of collisions.,

* Django or Flask * Pillow * This one depends on what you want to do. One of four approaches. * Find a service that has a public api available that also has a python library for interacting with it. Ex: [reddit praw](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) * Find a service that has a public api available that doesn't have a python library and create your own using [requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/). One I came across is [oxford dictionaries](https://developer.oxforddictionaries.com/). No idea if there is a python api already created but I couldn't find one in my 12 seconds of searching. * Find a service that has an api that isn't public and use requests library to make requests and parse the results to create your own unofficial api. * Find a service that doesn't have an api at all and basically create your own by scraping their pages and parsing the information. Pillow is actually really fun to work with. I wish I had more uses for it. My most often used creation with with Pillow is adding right click option for images with a "reduce size to 1MB" option that will take a picture and scale it down to just under 1MB while trying to maintain the highest quality and image size. I use that all the time for services/emails that have size restrictions. Interacting with APIs is probably the easiest to get into though. There are so many and there are so many that already have python wrappers that automating useful stuff is dead simple. Plus you get the leverage the power of all sorts of services that already did the heavy lifting for you and give you the nice, bite-sized, result wrapped in a nice, neat, little JSON package.
I'm a noob but [codeninja.com](https://codeninja.com) seems like fun if you're fluent
It's a bit on the ugly side, but you could always concat like above, then create a new field where you count the number of NaN s, then sort on the NaN counts row from low to high, then drop duplicates on the index keeping the first entry so you're not dropping the most complete rows.

Why are you hardcoding 44100 into the program? Why not make a constant at the top to define it?
Tensorflow and neural networks, provided you have a decent mid-range GPU to run them on.
I create the minimum code necessary to render Swagger docs from Django REST Framework.

Image manipulation is kinda broad. But, there are some really cool things you can do with computer vision. Checkout OpenCV and DLib python bindings. There are some starter project ideas here: https://www.pyimagesearch.com/ http://www.learnopencv.com/
On Friday evenings, my Internet speed drops off a cliff and my ISP support don't come back in until Monday by which time it's fixed. My latest little project was using it to run an ISP Speedtest every 15 mins on a raspberry pi and posts it to a Google soreadsheet. When the speed drops 30% below what I'm paying for, it runs a traceroute and some other diagnostics and adds it to the sheet beside the entry for each Speedtest. There's also soke graphs and trends added. If there's more than 4 consecutive low speed reports, an email is automatically sent to support with all the the details and a link to the spreadsheet. I had fun building it and learning about subprocesses and it saves me a ton of time.

I think you mean something with a Graphical User Interface (GUI), which is not a CLI application. Take a look at: PyQT, TKinter, wxWidgets, Kivy
To do it without non-python dependencies, you'd use the ncurses module. Godspeed. There are much better 3rd party modules for duing this. I'm partial to urwid. The term you're looking for, btw, is TUI, not CLI. CLI applications usually function as a single command with arguments, hence "command line interface". TUI stands for "Terminal User Interface"
How did you make those Django projects? Some resources which could be of some help for designing Online Ticket reservation system?
My most recent project was a D&amp;D slackbot so the players can check things like the campaign date, XP, inventory, etc through our chat. What does the planner do? Is the code up anywhere?
Thank you, this is exactly what I'm looking for. 
Trading bots
Not my code/program....im trying to figure out how to work it hah. How can I create a constant? Will it help me load a minute of audio instead of 1 second?
Can you explain the benefits of a dataframe to someone who has not touched Pandas (or just about any of those libraries: Sci, Matp, Pan)?
The data is stored in a columnar format, like an excel sheet or SQL table. You can manipulate and transform the data, join it to other data sources, export it etc.. Panda's is basically Excel on steroids. You can easily feed the data into a machine learning model as well. In the above example you could easily do: df = json_normalize(response.json)(['results']) df.to_csv('Lego.csv') or df.to_sql('Lego_table', sql_engine)

Any hiring managers want to opine on whether something like this looks credible enough to get me an interview and get hired?
First, check out /r/learnpython. Second, put four spaces in front of each line of code, so Reddit formats it better. Third, it doesn't look like you've defined add_dollars inside a class.
&gt; Where can I learn to be a professional python developer? Teach Yourself &gt; Where can I learn how to write documentations? My recommendation, release your code on github. It will pressure you to write documentation and you will self-teach yourself to write it. &gt; What skills besides python I need to learn? Atleast a basic grasp of computer science Concepts and Specializations. For example, I didn't learn just python. I learn how to do basic server management, web scraping techniques, Tricks and Go to libraries for common problems &gt; remote entry level job studying python Remote Unlikely at first, though I currently do work remote half the week.
I'm not sure that I follow. Is add_dollars a member of 'wallet' or is it a function in Wallet class?
Before you go looking for a canned solution to a problem you don't understand, just go back and make sure you understand your problem. The solutions will usually be more obvious after you do that. Organize your modules any way you want. The performance difference is practically zero.
Its easy for there to be an "obvious solution" once you know how to ask the right questions... but if I knew what kind of questions I should be wrapping around, then I would just use google for a *canned* answer. I was hoping for some actual discussion as to why or how any of this might be affecting the structure and performance, or if it is negligible, then so be it. 
Then you would need to call the method with an instance of the class, not with the module itself.
If you don't profile your application, then it's absolutely impossible to know the right questions when it comes to performance. No meaningful discussion can be had without that information.
so it should just be wall.add_dollars?
then i get a name error saying wallet isn't defined. 
Are you asking if you can create Python apps for mobile, or a mobile OS written with python? Because the latter would be horribly slow
ah, i see. it has to be the name of the object im calling to, in this case 'wallet1' thank you
Make a trading bot You won't need a job then
I made a script which runs on cron to regularly check an gmail address I set up. It parses the emails from a specific account (my main account) for a properly formatted subject and body. Based on what it finds it will call any of the specific 'plugin' python scripts I've put in it's plugins folder. Some of those plugins execute commands on my main home machine. Some of those commands send RabbitMQ messages which cause other things to happen on other machines. I also built a home website with flask that has forms that let me run those same commands without the emails, gives me access to all of my stored media (movies and music), and also runs a little app for scheduling family chores and calculating allowances.
Yeah, writing mobile apps with Python is entirely possible, but is not going to stop them from being able to send data to the OEM. You should really look at the Android archetecture, because on that platform at the end of the day, everything is going to have to be compiled to Java bytecode. I can't really speak for iOS though.
Just to save you one click: &gt; Zstandard is a highly tunable and therefore flexible compression algorithm with support for modern features such as multi-threaded compression and dictionaries. Its performance is remarkable and if you use it as a drop-in replacement for zlib, bzip2, or other common algorithms, you'll frequently see more than a doubling in performance.
So if we can have an Linux architecture and then developing all the system apps etc in python would cause no problem I think. As Linux is OSS. After the init process finishes it can hand the control to our python manager. That's what I am thinking
That's Vitor Freitas blog, his Django tutorial is excellent!
Anything. That was my first thought. But to add a little content, apart from the other posts (sorry if I repeat sth): * Games * Telegram not * Fun with data (get data from kaggle, Google, sensors, logfiles.... * Sound processing * Sound synthesis * Draw by yourself or algorithmically * Crack wlan passwords (only your own and only for research!!!!) * Use it as your shell * Find 10^6 digits of pi * projecteuler.net * Find large prime numbers or other fun (statistics, ....) with primes * Manage your email via IMAP * Automate things by email or telegram. This is fun if you have a server or other computer that runs all the time. A virtual server costs a few € or $ a month That's just what's on top of my mind. Maybe I'll edit later 
You really didn't look into the Android archetecture. Yes it uses the Linux kernel, but other than that it bears little resemblance to traditional Linux distrobutions. Every Android app **must** run in the Android Runtime which reads compiled bytecode. Python isn't even a compiled language. Then comes the challenge of interacting with the Java API framework that controls app state, notifications, and pretty much anything useful with Android. Projects like Kivy are working on ways to interact with these frameworks and runtimes, but you **can not** run Python apps natively on Android devices.
If you think you can make a cross platform Python SDK that rivals Kivy then be my guest, but you're going to need a lot more knowledge than Python and app development.
I was just curious but can you give me resources or guides or references so that I can at least build mobile apps using python for Android
Thanks this is good. Was hoping there was a wiki somewhere with sample code listed. But your scripts are certainly helpful for a newb like me :) 
Can you recommend a specific entry point / tutorial that you personally liked?
One TUI example that I've used in the past is [asciimatics](https://github.com/peterbrittain/asciimatics). As /u/the_hoser mentioned, [urwid](http://urwid.org/) is also a popular choice. 
On it. Thanks
That's not built-in ALSA support, but OSS, which is ALSA's predecessor. Not knowing anything about Arcade, I can only state that I recall Portaudio being a common solution to abstract audio cross-platform. I didn't see anything in particular from a quick search of the RTD pages about what is its backend, whatever it is if any.
honestly I never did any tutorials. one of mine was based off of parable of the polygons http://ncase.me/polygons/ and I just experimented from there
This is great but a little too advance for me.. Was looking for something more simple like sample scripts that can SSH into a network device, run a command, then do a certain action. Simple scripts like that I can follow to learn logic.

Discord bots are fun. I maintain several different ones at work for things like sending commands/queries to my PC while I'm away, performing daily automatic tasks, a code scanner for query-based real-time documentation generation, and logging output related to build/compile status. Basically means I have a cheat engine in my pocket for managing my PC remotely without much effort involved. Usually I'll start a 50 minute compile then go out for a walk, and never need to wonder about when it's done because my Discord bot can tell me!
Not quite sure tbh. At the start of the project I only had a single goal in mind so I just used Spotipy. Then I got used to it (how it responds e.t.c.) and decided to carry on adding functionality to it. No specific reason as to why it chose it.
avoid it. jk, I have been playing a lot with image manipulation libraries that and automation things that you do on a daily basis
Would also like to know this since the courses are quite expensive.

The problem is that, by default, virtual environments do not inherit site-packages from their host interpreter. You need to install them for the environment itself. You have two options: Download the package and run the setup file using your python env. $ source myenv/bin/activate $ cd mypackage $ python setup.py install This is usually enough for most packages. Or, alternatively, you can use pip. $ source myenv/bin/activate $ pip install mypackage Or, if you want, you can supply --system-site-packages, and the env will use the host interpreter's site-packages. This isn't good for distribution, but might be good if you're working on adding extra dependencies to, say, a python package used by the linux distribution you're developing for.
I also think that joining the path of the 'parent' object is the best approach to enable user to reuse the mappings defined by `JsonClass` classes.

I wrote a little script that uses tweepy to record tweets. I've mostly let it run on my server checking for tweets every 5 minutes. It's following 8 news accounts and has collected about 77,200 tweets over two months in sqlite db. It was fun to make, but I don't really know what I could do with the data.

What I have found is writing code to solve a problem that you are facing give immense satisfaction no matter how little code is. I wrote : 1. A small script that would tell at what pace I have to run my podcast to finish it before I reach office. [Git repo here|https://github.com/AkshayD110/PodcatTimer] 2. There are so many Mutual Funds suggested every week to invest in. This little script helps keep track of all the funds suggested, and picks the one that were suggested the most. [Git repo here |https://github.com/AkshayD110/MutualFundFinderScript] PS : I am still a beginner. Any of our suggestions would of great help ! thanks.

You can do audio and video editing and manipulation (pydub, moviepy and probably others). You can also rip audio from video. Also can add id3 tags to your audio files. I work in data science and I actually find the work I do fun so I usually do data science type stuff with Python for fun too.
Ok, here's help https://codecademy.com/tracks/python 
I really enjoyed the /r/roguelikedev tutorial. I've been a programmer for 40 years, but had never worked on any game projects (weird to me since I've been a gamer almost as long.) But that was a lot of fun.

Degrees &gt; Projects &gt; Certs
Sure. But it will have to wait until I out it up on Github. I started with this though. https://thepi.io/how-to-use-your-raspberry-pi-to-monitor-broadband-speed/ The traceroute conditional is simply a copy of the Speedtest-cli call in the code (Sorry, I'm on mobile). The only thing left to do that's not covered here was to add the traceroute conditional, format the output so that new lines from the traceroute don't get added to new cells and to import the CSV correctly into sheets (It doesn't recognizes them by default believe it or not). Speedtest-cli has a CSV output flag now but it's too verbose for my needs. But it might be something you want to look into. I'll share my finished work on Github once it's presentable. This was the first time I worked on a project in vim with no IDE features, so it's **messy**. 
Find an itch you have and scratch it. "if only this could do that", "it would be nice if..." Or make tick tack toe with an opponent. When it is perfect make it play against machine learning. Or something. 
Thanks a lot for sharing. I will go through this. Much appreciated.
I used a trading bot as an intro to cryptocurrency and trading on exchanges, I have a ML background so I love trying to apply it to new problems. However, I quickly found that you will not get far unless you have at least an intermediate level of understanding of the subject you're trying to optimize. I'm turning a profit now, but the daily/weekly changes to strategy are exhausting.

Sounds like it's time to turn your engine into an endless combat game in Android :) I love Java, wish I had more call to use it.
Whenever I want to do something like this in pygame I simply start from the docs: https://www.pygame.org/docs/ (Basically a list of every command and how they can be used) From then onward just break the graphical parts of your problem into steps and learn the commands for them. For instance, in Cellular Automation, there would need to be cells drawn which would be either squares or circles. So I'd get the relevant command for drawing a square (pygame.draw.rect()), then change its appearance based on given criteria as is necessary in Cellular Automation. Especially while you're learning, having the docs open all the time is incredibly useful. I always do when I'm working with an unfamiliar module.

I think it's a little bit apples and oranges. Degrees &gt;&gt; Certs, but those get you the interview. Projects are what get you the job.
You need to parse the JSON. import json player_data = json.loads(json_data) This parses json_data into a python dictionary (player_data) 
This curly braces represent a json data object. The code you have above that you used last time "data[0]['dataiwanted'] is saying that data is a list (which is sometimes the case) but in this instance you will want to do ['data']['id'] and ['data']['attributes']['name'].

Most of my tools lately have been data science stuff in jupyter notebooks, but most of my python stuff from the past year looks more like this: ```# imports, usually: from csv import DictReader, DictWriter # other times, it's click, or whatever else. #filenames infn = "export_week_of_04-06-18.ap" #really a csv file outfn = "bulk_changes_to_core_brand_items.csv" def get_row(file): ''' Generator that yields one row at a time. Output is a dict ''' with open(file, 'r', encoding='utf-8-sig') as csvfile: rdr = DictReader(csvfile) for row in rdr: yield(row) def convert(row): output = {} #converting from one format to another, or manipulating data in a specific way so that i can upload it to another system to make large changes in bulk (deleting 100K skus, re-formatting brand names, unarchiving if the mpns are in another file, etc) return output def ro_convert(row): """shitty name for renaming read-only aspects: sku qty""" output = {} output["sku"] = row["sku"] output["qty"] = row["qty"] return output def put_out(file, output, hdrs): with open(file, "w") as f: writer = DictWriter(f, fieldnames=hdrs) writer.writeheader() writer.writerows(output) def convert_all_rows(): data = {} qtys = [] for row in get_row(infn): data.append(convert(row)) for row in get_row(rofn): qtys.append(ro_convert(row)) for item in data: item["WarehouseQuantity"] = "DROPSHIP=0" for row in qtys: if item["Inventory Number"] == row["sku"]: item["WarehouseQuantity"] = f"DROP={row['qty']}" hdrs = data[0].keys() #switched to python 3.7 so keys retain order, and order doesn't really matter too much for uploading, but it works put_out(outfn, data, hdrs) if __name__ == "__main__": convert_all_rows()``` Obviously, i've stripped out most of the functionality so it's kind of a mess, but check out my #-led comments. So, the nice part is that when i'm doing some weird work in the repl, i can do a `from libraryname import *` and i've got this boilerplate ready to go for messing with files on a case-by-case situation. A lot of what I do is a coworker saying "Crap, I made a mistake and now x (where 1000 &lt; x &lt;= 150000) items are messed up - but i can't edit them back because of some dumb reason" and then i respond by generating this csv for them, or by using a different set of boilerplate and doing this via API. In addition, I can edit the filenames, some of the functionality, and then run it as a script. I write/edit these kinds of things somewhat rarely. The ones I use most often I don't have at the moment, but I convert to using Click, which lets you define flags and run an app as a cli program. it'll parse the CLI inputs and then run functions based on that, and it's fairly well documented. Then you can use that on the command line pretty easily. This is the kind of stuff I'd like to convert to using TKinter and then stick on coworkers' computers to make their lives easier. Most of the stuff in the `convert_row()` function would probably form a spreadsheet - input file header, output file header, and value that goes there for all items (bulk edits). Some text boxes for input and output filenames and that's mostly it, I guess. I'm not a good programmer, btw. I'm sure my code is trashy in a lot of ways. Once other people are using my tools, I'm sure I'll maintain the code better and do more frequent refactors and comment better. I need to remember how to use branching properly in git. But, it works, and it saves hours and hours of time for other people, so I don't question it too much - I'm not a developer, after all, and this is only one aspect of my job.
Just replied a few minutes ago. Feel free to follow up if you have any more questions for me.

Since the standard is to use spaces (Such a stupid decision!), and since the number of spaces varies and since a single missed space can make code non-working, AND since copied and pasted code may not have the same indent level AND might use a different number of spaces, or tabs, it's a mess... 
I’m currently working on a project that needs to transcribe hand-written digits to text, have you any suggestions?
Nice
Create your own Multi User Dungeon. If you don't know what that is, it is the great grandfather of MMORPGs. A couple months getting the socket code and a couple of classes for things like rooms and monsters. Then it's just adding commands, skills, powers, new areas, quests and stuff like that. Keep you busy for years doing cool stuff if you can get some regular players.
[Sure!](https://i.imgur.com/DNkSfQ3.png). The player is the '@' symbol. They start at the 'A' and move around the map. The forest (T's) and other terrain features are randomly generated each time. I got the world gen mechanics from a game called 'A Dark Room' (which is a masterpiece btw, I highly recommend it). I plan to turn it into a 2D dungeon crawler, where visiting map features generates a random dungeon to loot. I'm in peak procrastination mode at uni though, so knowing me, I'll lose interest after the semester ends.
Define the passer function, which takes two arguments : (1) a predicate –call it p– and (2) a list of values. The passer function returns a reference to a function object defined inside it: this internal function is called with no arguments. When we call the returned function object, it returns the first/next value in the list for which the predicate returns True; if there are no more values in the list satisfying this predicate, return None. For example, if p = passer(is_prime,[2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11]) then calling p() returns 2; then calling p() returns 3; then calling p() returns 5; then calling p() returns 7; then calling p() returns 11; then calling p() returns None. Hint: the returned/inner function should use a variable defined in the scope of the passer function to store an index for the list parameter of passer. In the returned/inner function, declare that variable nonlocal so that it can be rebound. A nonlocal declaration (one declared in the scope enclosing the inner function) is used like a global declaration: see the notes concerning global. Use no global variables in your solution.
Sounds like your 'simple python problem' is your homework. So no disrespect, but no.

I’m pretty sure iStat Menus has something for GPU monitoring in their recent versions (6+ I think). Could be wrong. 
Yes, I use jinja2 to write SQL scripts all the time.
This looks awesome. I've started working on an app recently(not with python but I haven't seen many open source D&amp;D projects). It's hard to find references, so I'll definitely check yours out.
Can you share your code? I’m new to python and would like to learn on how you did that.
Thanks, it does monitor GPU usage, but I'm looking for something I can access through my Python app.

Ah, the old 'cook book' programming technique. I'm not sure there are modules you could slam together to make this work, but you could just use random noise to populate a grid of pixels. COLORS = red, blue, green. if randomNum is &gt; someNum: this.color = COLORS.red It's been awhile since I wrote python code, but you could use this pseudo-code to iterate through a grid of values and generate an image.

Take a small script that you would normally write using functions, and try to rewrite it using OOP. There are a lot of great free resources out there like Knupp's blog posts... https://jeffknupp.com/blog/2014/06/18/improve-your-python-python-classes-and-object-oriented-programming/ Also if you want to take your GIS skills to the next level, try using more GDAL, Shapely and other similar open source geospatial libraries. You would be amazed at how powerful they are.
Now I wonder if there are any templating formats for binary files, and how they would even look.
I have to thank OP, my mind is racing with all the things I could use J2 outside of HTML. So thank you!!

You have to understand that at the time there wasn't a bunch of multiple cores going around and the threading API was just sort of gaining traction in the mainstream. So the GIL very simple and clean solution in a world in which there really was only one core.
Check out pypng. I did something generating PNG format images with it a number of years back. Nice thing too is that PNG is renderable in browsers if that's something you're after like the link you provided. I think you could pretty easily save "sprites" and stitch them together with it too.
He was thinking that in a world with only one core processors this is a completely fine solution oops.
I like data analysis, but if that's not your thing then maybe you'd be more interested in [hacking](https://www.amazon.com/Black-Hat-Python-Programming-Pentesters/dp/1593275900/ref=sr_1_1)
You could use PyQt4. I generate large fractals and save them using QPixMap and QPainter. What the site looks like, unless I'm wrong, Sea of Thieves is a giant static map. If it's 24x24, all spaces could be stored in a list or dictionary of lists. Then just limit the picture to a square with a destination in each corner. Your symbols could be colored squares and circles or text if you didn't feel like having to do graphic design. You don't even need to use the typical PyQt4 overhead, you could figure it out with limited python knowledge.
Damn bro this looks really clean 
I enjoyed the read and learned something. Thanks!
I've been working on this project for a couple years on and off, but I finally have a full v1.0 together. It's a card game called "King's Court" that I created years ago, finally making a digital debut. The biggest hindrance was writing a rule set since the game had no predefined terms or lingo, so I had to find a way to talk about it in a way that "makes sense". Then having to put visuals in... formatting... revising... more visuals... writing the rule set in English proved a lot more numbing and tedious than all the programming building a functional game. That said, it's built to run on Ubuntu 12.04 / Debian 7 and above, I haven't tested it on Windows. If you know how to install the libraries through pip on Windows, install pyqt4 and colorama and run "main_game.py", I can't imagine it wouldn't work. On Ubuntu/Debian, run INSTALL as superuser to get the minimum needed libraries. Then chmod a+rwx 'run_game.sh' to run it. There's a basic AI to play against, can be difficult at level 6, but not necessarily "smart". The game doesn't think ahead and since it's an original game, there's no theory for the math involved. I've crunched some stats and tried to understand the probabilities and all the nuanced conditions. There are some LibreOffice Spreadsheet files (.ods) in the repo with some of that work in them, but good luck understanding that scratch pad. I'd be curious to see literally any other person download and give it a try. The repo itself needs to be cleaned up. I have a lot of miscellaneous files scattered about that need deleting and files on top-level that should be in resource folders, misc folders, etc. My commenting is horrible and sparse. Work in progress, but it's finally working and has rules to reference to make sense beyond my brain.
On mobile, so I can't check this, but I think `zip(*places)` will give you what you want, provided your starting list is called `places`
Nice. Here's one I made with tkinter bank when I was learning python like six years ago: https://github.com/dmarx/mines
It really depends on the binary format involved
Your blog format is inspiring. I like the information queue box.
No. Spaceeeeeguppppyy
Oddly enough I went at it with fresh eyes today. I got it. I am just getting myself familiar with basic concepts like while loops, if statements, branching choices by a user. I'm going to have to tackle concepts little by little. The nice machine is hilarious. Made a magic 8ball type thing that says yes, no, maybe, or never when you ask it a question, made a simple albeit slightly flawed guessing game. Long way to go, but definitely starting to get a handle on solving smaller problems. Thank you for your reply and encouragement.
There is no one-size-fits-all answer for this. It depends a bit on what you want to do. If I may assume that you are new to Python and have modest immediate goals, I'd say that installing anaconda's distribution will be the best option. It's big, but one advantage is that you won't have to install many modules because it comes with so many obvious ones. If you do want to install something, go to the terminal and use "pip install MODULENAME", or you can use the anaconda navigator to install it with a GUI. Anaconda now comes with Visual Studio Code as an editor (instead of the somewhat buggy Sypder), but I still prefer PyCharm for python editing. Everyone will give you a different recommendation on editor though. I find that Anaconda is good for many things, but when I'm getting serious, I prefer to download python from python.org create a virtual environment and then install only the modules I need for each package. PyCharm will make this somewhat seamless as it defaults to creating a virtual environment for each project. My friend suggests a less wordy recommendation (and slightly different from mine): * Install python from python.org and use the built in IDLE editor until you outgrow that and then install PyCharm. * If you are specifically interested in scientific or statistical programming, Anaconda is nice because it installs so much of the needed modules by default. With Anaconda, either use VSCode (that comes with anaconda), or (as we both recommend) use PyCharm. there are many things people will suggest that are not appropriate for beginners, a few of important ones are: * **homebrew or macports approaches**: This is too much to pile on to learning to use Python. I've used both of those for years and they are great if you are very comfortable with the linux/bsd/etc. commandline (including where things are on macos and how various things are simlinked) because both can easily become corrupted and require fiddling with. I've had them both break, or act wonky and found myself spending lots of time troubleshooting. Honestly, now that you can practically pip install anything, I don't see why people bother with this approach over python.org + pip. * **sublime and similar editors**: Setup of a Python environment close to PyCharm requires quite an effort for a newbie. Once set up, it's pretty sweet, but I prefer not to have to do all that work. If you're up for it, there is a big community. If you're staring out with python, it's a lot to put in between you and getting started with the language. * **visual studio code**: I haven't used it within anaconda, so I don't know if they set it up fully or not. However, a normal install of Visual Studio Code, which is very cool when setup, takes a lot of work to setup and may involve choices (e.g., what beginner knows which linter they want?) you are not ready to make. On the other hand, do you really need to install python on your system? There are more options, but these are 2 options that allow you to code in a browser (including pip installing any modules that you need). * https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb * https://www.pythonanywhere.com/ for you pros out there, did you now that colab.research.google let's you toggle one flag and run your code on their GPUs??!! The big downside of these approaches is that there is pretty much no GUI or game type modules available other than ones that render to image/pdf/etc or to html. However, if your needs aren't graphical like that, then these can be great options. Good luck Python rocks!
It's one of my favorite talks of all time. I will upvote this every time I see it. Bonus: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsVtHqICeKE
Nice read!
I can't recommend anything exactly because I'm it familiar with that editor, but I want to note that many of three times I've become a better programmer is when I've forced myself into new paradigms. At one time that was making myself learn and use Java seriously. Another time was transitioning from using just my favorite text editor that I was very comfortable with to using full featured IDEs. In both of those cases I didn't become a full time convert but I definitely became better at putting ideas into computers. I guess my point is that you should make sure to really push yourself outside if your comfort zone and try a different editor! 
https://github.com/ffcmac/scrapes There it is in all its glory...
I've done loads of web dev using flask Mobile price comparing website from different e-commerce sites using Django Wrote a script to move my mouse using keyboard because my mouse stopped working :/ Made a keylogger that sends me an email at a particular time of day as a prank to someone who I didn't like :P Wrote a library to send an SMS to anyone inside India.
So I tried to find the API as an exercise but couldn’t find it. It seems to me like the first request had the result already in its response. This response is a html document with a script tag in it that contains the ‘result’ json. There are some XHR requests but the do not return any information about the items. Where am I going wrong in finding the API?
I once worked on a project that used jinja2 to write out JSON, it was quite unreadable, and I had to move the logic back up into view, then later to the model. Just worth bearing readability/maintainability in mind 
Good read, thanks. Never really gave much thought to mutable vs immutable while writing code this opened my mind a bit. 
Learn them both. They're good at different things.
Can you share the difference or any link where I can read about the comparison of both.
A lot of languages have default argument values, and they all work differently. I want to say that Ruby initializes the default at call time, C++ requires constexpr, and Dart requires const (the only languages I know with defaults). So I always stick with the common denominator of purely immutable defaults.
 Web Crawler ! It's sooooo interesting .
imo, programming is not easy.. it takes lot of time to get used to and learning never stops.. trying to apply what you've learned to do a project is a great way to further your understanding.. I've seen similar complaints about Codecademy.. there are certainly other great resources to learn.. my personal reco are https://automatetheboringstuff.com/ and http://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/ (and http://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/python/english3e/) you'll find loads of learning resource if you check the sidebar of this subreddit.. you could also check out https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/index

You can try to collect candles data using my project https://github.com/Closius/crypto_trader Originally it implemented for Bitfinex, but you can change it for your stock exchange
Cheers I'll try that
AlphaVantage has an API with a python wrapper. I don’t think it’s real-time though
Tried that with a few tutorials just kept getting errors
Yeah used to use that then one day page of errors 
thank you
I made a twitch bot that parses the saltybet chat for fighter information and stores it in a database. It also announces when tournaments start in a specific telegram channel. The statics for the current fighter are then displayed on a website I created with flask. Everything runs on heroku, and has been running for a month now. It's my first python project so I'm pretty happy it's this stable.

Thanks for sharing!
If there's **one** thing you should know it's that we programmers are always looking for stuff on Google. Learn to search properly, using the right keywords, and you'll be able to follow through when you block in difficult tasks :)
Are there any examples of RTS elements in the 15 minute series or any other educational tutorial like this? 2d maps with moving points and cursor selection? I've got an idea adapted from an old online game i remember i'd like to put in action as a proof of concept but i'm completely lost on how to do it. I don't know the basic operations and parts of code that would constitute a game/program and it's UI. My programming experience is in matlab and anaconda distribution of python for calculations. 
Why do you cite the full GPL in every file when you have a LICENSE file present? 
There is no exit condition on your while, so it'll run until the end of times (or at least until your memory is full)...
Link to the problem *might* be https://www.physics.purdue.edu/webapps/index.php/course_document/index/phys272/1165/122/5410 OP, is this correct?
That is exactly it.
Try using print () to output some variables to console. It can help with getting a sense of what is going on. Not really sure about the other stuff I'm also pretty noobish.
And here's one, that I didn't make: 
Thanks! Asking for more products did it for me!
Do yourself a favor and follow common coding guidelines (-&gt; pep8). Do not use `from x import *`, write variables in lower case and embed your tests in a function: def main(): '''implement me'''' if __name__ == 'main': main()
What common coding guidelines are those? You are saying to replace what is specifically instructed to be typed into my code via the assignment.
There are some libraries that have immutable container, for example: https://github.com/tobgu/pyrsistent https://github.com/magicstack/immutables
We'll help for now, but further questions should be asked in /r/learnpython, or even in /r/physics since much of your problem appears to be physics related. I'll try to help but I've never used VPython and I probably won't install it as I apparently need to install another python 2 for MacOS and that's a little more than I want to do. In your while loop you are asked to `Calculate the net force on the particle "F"` but I don't see that happening. What I do see is an attempt to set momentum. The problem asked you to set the momentum *before* the loop in step `m`. You will update momentum inside the loop, but you have to calculate the force first. Step `r` gives you the formula for the force which includes both the magnetic and electric fields. At step `s` you update the particle position and then in step `t` you update the momentum. Have a go at that and post some updated code.
AlphaVantage works well for me. It has "real-time" quotes but only up to a minute. If you need accurate, more consistent real time quotes you are absolutely going to have to pay for it. Another API you could use is Tiingo. This doesn't have real-time quotes but it does have historical EOD OHLCV (and adjusted OHLCV) data. 
You are probably too hasty. If you did the API course you can do HTTP requests, and with the https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/ you should have all the information. 
Nice work! Can you share the CSV file? If the data is confidential, just share the file without data. Because I want to mimic your work but I am quite confused with the data structure.
It looks like python is your first computer language. The first language can be quite hard because are actually learning *two* things: * the python language * the general art of Programming It's not often appreciated that writing software is a two-step process, *visualizing* the algorithm or process first, and then writing code. The first step is programming with a capital 'P'. During this step, if you have some experience, you don't think in terms of one language much, you think in terms of the solution, lookups, loops, key-value mappings, databases just as something you get data from, etc. Once you have an approach mapped out, you start to write code and this is where a particular language gets used and you have to map the abstract thoughts from the first step into the particular language. Learning the art of programming while you learn your first language is what makes things hard at the start. Once you've learnt your first language and something about programming the second language is relatively easy, the third even easier, and so on. This also explains why you should learn a few languages that are very different in style, such as python, C/C++, one of the lisps, etc. This is how you get practice mapping the general programming concepts onto different languages. You should also try writing programs for very different types of problems since this helps develop your Programming. Hang in there, and good luck!

In theory, theory and practice are the same thing. In practice, they aren't. But seriously. Tackle real problems, and eventually things will click. Coding is a frustrating exercise, even for experience developers.
Mirroring PakLong's comment, you should make a GIT repo for this! I think it would be interesting to slap a GUI ontop of it.

The book _Refactoring_ by Fowler taught me a lot, especially about OO. That it's twenty years old and about Java is completely irrelevant, it's famous.
But why
This is what we call progress in computer science.
page of errors or notes to fix it?
I hoping on this to recommend Openclassroom. It is a website which offer tutorials on the bones of Programming. An example of tutorial : « oriented object programming ». It is using Java I believe, but the programming language is just a mean to an end and presented as such in the class.
$200 hahahaha 😆😆😆🤮
Is there a follow up blog post coming showing how to perform an action when the BTC price drops below a certain threshold? Say for example play the first second of Napalm Death's "You Suffer"?
Not really. See at the top corner. For new students it's only $11. and if you are a registered user you can get this course for $19.99
Take an open source library that you use regularly (like Pandas or something similar), and check out their "Issues" page on GitHub. For big projects there should be lots of issues tagged as "beginner friendly" or similar - dive into them and see if you can fix them, and then contribute a pull request back to the project. The best way to learn is just by doing and studying others' work along the way.
Great! I'm a fan of edX from previous classes. I'll look into it.
Sound advice. Start small and with a program I am familiar with. And the idea of branching out from esri sounds wonderful. Thanks!
if it is still relevant after so long, it must be great! thanks for the pointer. 
As the sidebar says (in **bold**): If you are about to ask a question, please consider r/learnpython
Courses are a great way to learn things, but as you found they are pretty sanitized. The real world is messy and the person who implemented the system you are interacting with may not be doing the right/smart/best thing. Or maybe it's righter/smarter/bester than the info in the course. I find that just trying stuff out and trying to hack it is the best approach. The value from the courses is in suggesting possible things to try. And you might have to step back and re-engineer the entire process to "route around the damage".
 import webbrowser from lomond import WebSocket websocket = WebSocket('wss://ws-feed.gdax.com') for event in websocket: if event.name == "ready": websocket.send_json( type='subscribe', product_ids=['BTC-USD'], channels=['ticker'] ) elif event.name == "text": if event.json['price'] &lt; 1000: webbrowser.open('https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybGOT4d2Hs8') 
&gt;&gt; And no, the built in "type hints" don't count. Why ?
&gt; Python still needs a TypeScript. why ?
&gt; I'm currently being force to use Python. I hate it. Fine. I hate many things myself. But would you care to explain why you do ?
No!!. I'm so sorry. You can try this site and here you can find some torrents of udemy. But when you looking for something special, sometimes you have to pay. anyway here you go, https://www.freetutorials.us
&gt; I've found Python particularly unsuited for my use cases. &gt; So, you see, I'm am literally forced to use what is the correct tool for the job. Well... 
maybe if you have a grudge against youtube-dl?
It supports different sources, try another source. I know Google and Yahoo finance did some redesigns recently
https://simple.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_(mathematics) We typically count in base 10, where our numbers go from 0-9. Base 2 (computer binary) only contains the numbers 0 &amp; 1. Octal or base 8 only contains numbers 0-7.
It’s the base of how that number is written. In every day life, you use base 10, the series of digits consisting of numbers from 0-9. Number written as “472”, for example, is a representation of value of 4*10^2 + 7*10^1 + 2*10^0 You can always write the same value in other base. For example, computer use base 2 in their system, digits only consists of 0 and 1. In base 2, to represent 5, you have to write “101” instead, which is 1*2^2 + 0*2^1 + 1*2^0. You will learn about this when you get to high school or undergraduate degree in computers related major, I think.

I like it. Looks like datacamp has essentially certification-ized their entire python cirriculum. Why they chose to go the anaconda route instead of branding it a datacamp cert, Im not sure. Datacamp already has a great reputation for very high quality material. At the very least, it gives me a nice carrot to keep working through the datacamp courses. I doubt Ill get the whole cert though, the final project is too pricey.

Unfortunately, even those "beginner friendly" projects are out of my league. There's a ton of folders and I don't even know where to start. 
Very kind of you, I hope you find the content to be valuable! Thanks for your support, and please don't hesitate to provide feedback. Cheers, and have a nice day! :)
Oh, so many things... First, indent four spaces to make code like: this Second, I struggle to think of even a single *good* reason to do any `from mymodule import *`. Third, and maybe the most important, this obfuscates at best. There isn't anything even resembling the slightest bit of real encryption at all! And, it can only handle the small subset of letters you hardcoded. It doesn't even handle capitals! Let along anything else. Was this just a fun "project" for learning? In that case, great, but no need to share it! If this was a real attempt at a useful tool, then you have a lot to learn
Check out Pinance: https://github.com/neberej/pinance Its simple and easy. It's what i used to make a real time stock ticker app thing for the macbook touch bar.
Goo. That sounds terrible. Can you start with trying a better data input solution? Did you look at Google Forms? It's really easy for you and users. Then it's a fairly small hurdle to manipulate and gather data. If you want to Python that, the API's over there are pretty simple too.
they are old people, i'm gonna lose data if I ask them to fill at home =/ There is no budget nor time in the event to make them fill the form digitally at the site. I also can't convince my boss to come to the this century, so I'm kind of stuck with the paper stuff.
Goo. That sounds terrible. Can you change the data input with something like Google Forms? It's really nice for you and the users. It automagically logs responses to a G Sheet. If you want to use Python from there you can use the Google API's. They have good documentation to get started, even if you are new to API's.
There was a time when I kept making evolution simulators of various sorts haha. It's pretty fun to dream up a virtual ecosystem and see what happens when you make small tweaks to how things are structured.
yeah, same!
I haven't seen the new season yet. I did wonder when they would get to this topic.
Ok I'll roll with my 2to3 version Thanks!
the sidebar on this subreddit has plenty of resources... and as mentioned in the sidebar, you should actually check out /r/learnpython for learning python and beginner questions... that subreddit also has a list of resource - https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/index 
Also the entire mappings are in the source code. This is not encryption at all.
I like using jinja to make markdown, which I can then use pandoc to derive other formats like HTML/docx/PDF
The best teacher is practice. I too struggle learning OO back in the mid-90's. Took I don't know how many classes and ready several books on the topic. It wasn't until I actually started doing it in code that the concepts took hold in my brain.
It's a bit of obfuscation. Could be used for the message in a email. It wouldn't withstand any real scrutiny, but if you just want to keep your spouse from seeing something, it could be used.
base = the number of symbols you have to represent unit values. Recall place values. take the example of the decimal number 10, 0 is in the units (10^0) position, 1 is in the tens (10^1) position, the next position is 100 (10^2) and the next position is 1000 (10^3). here 10 is the base. this is because you have 10 symbols to represent values, 0-9. in this case if we have a **binary** number 10, here 0 is in the units position (2^0), the 1 is in the 2s position (2^1), the next position is 4 (2^2), and the next is 8 (2^3). here 2 is the base, because we have only 2 symbols (0 and 1). if you had 16 symbols, 0-9 and a-f, then the lowest place value would be 16^0 = 1, the next highest would be 16 (16^1), 256 (16^2), 4096 (16^3). so in hexademical number 10, 0 would be in the units, 1 would be in the 16s position. 
May not be helpful, but have you tried: help(int())
Take a look at `argparse` instead of writing option parsing logic.
Fantastic :) I guess in the (very) long term CFFI is the way to get speed as well ?

I've built a scraper (using Beautiful Soup like many others) that allowed me to get back years of notes from a site that never implemented an export functionality (or any API). (I was using the site when I was studying, so being able to access them from mobile or any computer was a huge bonus. Now that is no longer the case, I wanted to get all that stuff to my physical HDD and discontinue using the site). I managed to recover ALL the text data I had on the site, plus I could run some statistical queries for the fun (most common keywords, that sort of thing). Currently thinking of making a personal dream journal in Python, leveraging a similar keywords system as the site did for the notes.
I played Raptor when I was a kid. Yours is a much more lively game, though!

If you include a LICENSE file, what's the point of putting ANY license citation in any other file? I thought that's what the LICENSE file's purpose was for? I legitimately don't understand.
The first thing to consider is whether you have a problem that can be solved using objects or not. OOP isn't a magic wand that solves all programming problems. Are the things you're dealing with "objectifiable"? Such as: person name height weight get() set() age sex If your doesn't have things that can be wrapped up into nice, sensible objects, using OOP will likely lead to more problems than it sovles. 
If it's multiple choice what i would do is change the choices to (1, 2, 3, 4) Then set up a google doc with a table for each person and use Google's voice recognition to automatically put choices into the cells as I talk. So it would be 1 2 4 2 1 etc. 
Windows or Linux server? If Linux, use `screen`.

Hey, I wrote the code — thanks for the great feedback :) This actually started out as a toy example for overriding paintEvent, so it's (like these things tend to be) a bit of a contrived example. I will add a note that there is an easier way. Re: using a `.ui` file it's similar — the app is part of a series to [explain PyQt by example](https://github.com/mfitzp/15-minute-apps), and I didn't start introducing Qt Designer til a couple of apps later. It would definitely shrink the boilerplate on the main window, though not sure it would do much for the tiles (they're mostly behaviour logic/painting). I was scratching my head trying to remember why I didn't use `QPushButton` — it's because I needed right-click detection for flagging spaces. The button widgets don't support that, and so mouse events were the only option. Thanks again!
Thanks, man. I've heard of pygsheets but completely forgot about it.
Thanks for the thorough answer. I think I'll give asyncio a try first. Also I don't think I made my needs completely clear. I will be connecting any given computer to a switch, which will be connected to the raspberry pi cluster. But the catch is that I want any given computer to be able to connect to the switch without having to do anything else than run the python program. If I were to make a server on the computer I would have to do that on each computer I connect, and unless I can have the python program create it automatically it may get a bit tedious. Alternatively I guess I could buy a physical server and use it for file storage, however currently I do not need that much storage. 
At first glance it seems OK - I understand what it’s trying to do and I’d also recommend looking into argparse. Also, have you tried running your code to see if it works? And screenshots are not very conductive for sharing code ;-)
No
That is really, really cool!

I don't think you're actually asking a question here. Are you talking about autocorrect but meaning "autocomplete", like [fuzzy matching](http://pythonhosted.org/scikit-fuzzy/userguide/fuzzy_control_primer.html) or using Markov chains to produce code from limited input? Or are you talking about actual autocorrect as in like, spelling errors? (Which is already a feature in most IDEs, by the way [they tag variables/functions/classes/etc and provide them as options as you're typing]) 
Thank you ----____----
yup-__-
you should post example data
Bottle and Flask are microframeworks. They handle a few tasks such as routing, requests, etc but you have to write everything else. This also includes some database interface should you be using one. I cannot comment too much on Flask vs Bottle except to say that Flask is more popular. Personally though, I use Bottle since I like the compact nature of it (and web-crawlers and I are the only real traffic to my sites). Django is "batteries included". It has a lot more built in already that you do not need to develop. This also includes its own ORM for databases. I really can't speak too much to performance, but I'd imagine the major limitation is your code and not the framework. And the server software you use to run it.
I cant but I can post code, one sec.
That's a nice article. Serious question: I am not sure how the "".join method works internally. Hence, if we do sth like "".join([str(data) for data in container]) it would be similarly inefficient if it joins elements sequentially. E.g., if our container is sth like [1, 2, 3] with sequentially, I mean that it internally does def join(container, sep=""): output = "" for i in container: output += str(i) + sep return output 
https://wiki.python.org/moin/WebFrameworks
 datecheck = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=['UUID', 'Host', 'LastServiceDate', 'NextServiceDate']) # Find and reset clock for host. mask = datecheck['UUID'].str.contains(row.UUID) print (mask)
Django does a lot out of the box. Good for standard sites, bad if you need to to something that doesn't fit into its complex design. Flask needs you add more parts yourself making it better for really minimalist sites or very unusual sites. Never used bottle personally. Ultimately the programmer matters more than the framework. 
 mask = datecheck['UUID'].str.contains(row.UUID) datacheck[mask] think this will do it
 d = {1: {'Host': 'LOCAL', 'LastServiceDate': '2018-03-22', 'NextServiceDate': '2018-03-29', 'UUID': 'dfawcewfwefafewfwefcewc'}, 2: {'Host': 'REMOTE1', 'LastServiceDate': '2018-03-23', 'NextServiceDate': '2018-03-27', 'UUID': 'asdfsdafsdafewafewwfeawe'}, 3: {'Host': 'REMOTE2', 'LastServiceDate': '2018-03-24', 'NextServiceDate': '2018-03-25', 'UUID': 'sdafsdfsadfsdfsafsdfafsd'}} df = pd.DataFrame.from_dict(d, orient='index') mask = -df['LastServiceDate'].isin(['2018-03-23']) df['NextServiceDate'] = df['NextServiceDate'].where(mask, other="2018-01-01") 
hahaha, well _now_ you tell me... that definitely would have saved me a bunch of time! I'm glad I dug into the python guys though, I learned quite a bit.
Df.loc[df.UUID==x, 'NextServiceDate'] = new_date

 while 1:
Maybe you have changed the layout of your website. I had accessed ur website last year somewhere around September so I might have missed out on any update. Back then I had to search for the pyimagesearch tutorials via Google. Most of them were not sequential and were more like recipes for individual mini projects . So it became a bit difficult to follow given that I am a beginner And yes, I was interested in your computer vision (autonomous path planning ) using Raspberry pi. I believe I had followed one of your blog post about face detection/identification, I'm not sure. It was very good. I thought I would continue learning more about that but couldn't find anything . Maybe it's included in that paid section of the course, idk. Also, it's totally fine with me that you have kept your courses not free. You are the author, you have total control over the way you want to distribute your material. No arguments over that. I just felt that if your site had lil bit more structured way of learning for the free/tutorial section , given that you are the only blog related to image processing that's original and high quality, it would have been better. Nevertheless, I'll check out your site incase any changes have been made.
another consideration would be that if the value you're selecting is a unique identifier is to set that column as the index, it would make accessing it a lot easer.

Sockets (the actual chat functionality) and tkinter (the user interface) You can then host the server in your own computer in which you’d need to know port forwarding (not python related), or you can host a web server with like Flask or something 
How would i just get the current or last price using that ?
I extensively use Pycharm on windows and sometimes Jupyter Notebooks. I want to give either Vim or Emacs a try for my development.

Hey subhro, out of context, but nice to meet another subhro. Im a CS major too!
&gt; I don't understand how does adding another layer (WSGI) solves this You aren't adding another layer. You are replacing the flask/django builtin server with a proper implementation: nginx, apache, etc... &gt; Why do all Python frameworks recommend this? &gt; What's the real problem with their own server? They told you... the built-in server implementation is shit and only functional enough to provide a simple method for testing your application. Once the project is functional you should move to a proper sever for deploying in production.
Because Flask serves only one request at a time you will have people waiting if there are many requests. I’m don’t know about Flask specifically but as a development toolkit it may not do a lot of caching either, so for example instead of keeping an image in memory it has to read it from disk every time it is requested, which is slow and scales horribly (IO is expensive). If you stick your Flask app on top of a WSGI it does not run as a process but its functions are called by the underlying web server whenever needed. Incoming requests are mapped to the right functions by the WSGI, so to speak. This allows the server to do its job, and given that half of the web runs on Apache and the other half runs on Nginx they are pretty good at it at this point.
Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI) is essentially middleware that lets your python application be served by a proper web server. In contrast to running flask.run(), using WSGI will allow you to easily run multiple threads and load balance your site. The most common way to do this is through a reverse proxy in nginx. Nginx is also faster at serving your static files (js, css, etc) at an order of magnitude than a true python implementation. The biggest reason to not use the flask server is because it is single threaded. If you have a page that runs a SQL query that takes ~20 seconds and someone else tries to access another page on your server, they have to wait until that other request finishes and returns the rendered/jsonified information. I've found uWSGI + nginx is easier to setup than mod_wsgi in apache, especially when using python3.
Hm, no layout changes were made since September of last year. Same design, same layout. FWIW there is a search bar at the top right hand side of the search bar. You can use that instead of Google. The free tutorials are also covered in a more structured way in the (free) crash courses I offer as well. I'll be doing a refresh/release of a new new course hopefully in the next couple of months. The new will one will ideally give you more of the linear path you are looking for.
Thanks for your answer. &gt; If you stick your Flask app on top of a WSGI it does not run as a process but its functions are called by the underlying web server whenever needed. I don't understand this part. What do you mean by "does not run as a process"? Do you mean "myapp.py" will be called **everytime** a new request is passed by nginx to WSGI? For example, my app initially connects to DB, and does a few initialization things, etc., so I don't want to restart "myapp.py" each time a request comes.
Chapter 54 in case anyone else is looking for the exact location. 
Yes, essentially. I can't tell you how your app will interact with being multithreaded, but check these documentation pages: http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.12/deploying/uwsgi/ https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/FAQ.html https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Options.html
Yes. I had that flipped. Nice catch.
It seems like you’re already doing well with Bottle but I’m going to assume you ended up rebuilding a lot of the built in features of Django. 
Oh really, for each request passed by WSGI, "myapp.py" restarts from zero? So we can't keep anything in RAM, we have to restart the app for each request?
Thanks. If I already use Apache, do I need something like Gunicorn to connect Python/Flask to Apache?
I love RHEL 6 😘
That's essentially what happens already with your built in server - it's not restarting the app when all it's designed to do is handle one request. uWSGI loads your app into memory before forking, as such the memory space is shared as much as possible. This behavior depends on the WSGI implementation, I just used uWSGI as an example, others probably do something similar.
Yes.
I do most of my programming with tensorflow and keras and doing that on a browser is nearly impossible.
And it is still very difficult to plan and develop python3 on RHEL 7. Unless I am doing something wrong. Developing back end services is a pain, RHEL 7 always defaults to python2.
See http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.12/deploying/ There are multiple options. mod_wsgi looks to be recommended first for apache.
&gt; Chapter 54. Deprecated Functionality &gt; &gt; [Python 2 has been deprecated](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/7.5_release_notes/chap-red_hat_enterprise_linux-7.5_release_notes-deprecated_functionality) &gt; &gt; Python 2 will be replaced with Python 3 in the next Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) major release. &gt; &gt; See the Conservative Python 3 Porting Guide for information on how to migrate large code bases to Python 3. &gt; &gt; Note that Python 3 is available to RHEL customers, and supported on RHEL, as a part of Red Hat Software Collections. 
I thought it was like: Python Flask `myapp.py` &lt;--- WSGI ---&gt; nginx &lt;---&gt; client What is the purpose of Gunicorn then? 
With your description of traffic, it won't matter which library you choose. If you need busy yourself with a project, maybe you should just pick one and go for it? Django is more likely to get you a job, but overall, a good company won't care if it's django, flask, falcon (you should check this one out if you only need a REST interface), sanic, graphql, etc. Django has batteries built in. Once you put something together, you'll feel like Django makes you fly until you hit the brick wall of Django magic that requires you to know the deep internals of the library. It's really unlikely you'll hit that. Django has an ORM and encourages its usage with its many 1st and 3rd party integrations. Flask is similar to Bottle but with far more community support. Unfortunately, that means you have to evaluate every library you decide to use. So in comparison to Django, you'll end up with a better overall understanding of how your stack was built. You'll likely use SqlAlchemy for relational database work, which is really functional but not particularly intuitive. SqlAlchemy can do things that the Django ORM struggles with, but it's really unlikely you'll care about these things. Regardless of your library choice, scaling happens when you setup a load balancer with gunicorn threads all running on distributed servers. While it is important to know the theoretical limit of library A vs library B gives you a certain requests/sec, it's mostly just bragging rights and in practice, how you architect your system will greatly affect your ability to handle traffic. 
I use bottle directly with no problem at all.
Thank you!
Virtual env
I think your confusion makes a lot of sense. Go's web server (if not the default then the equivalent of Flask or Django) doesn't need a supplementary program. The reason is the GIL. In the future one can imagine this disappearing. You can imagine "multithreaded code from the beginning". We're not there yet. Might arrive sooner than you think though.
/path/to/virtualenv/bin/mydaemon Or if you haven't written an entrypoint in your setup.py, /path/to/virtualenv/bin/python myscript.py
Just point it to the actual Python3.X binary. That can be in /usr/bin/ or where ever the virtualenv is located. All virtualenv does, is place all your dependencies and the actual Python binary into one directory and change the Python interpreter PATH environment variable for that session to the location of the virtualenv. Instead of invoking python does use the full path to your version of python.
\2. You aren't exactly wrong. Your application won't magically become multi-threaded internally. What will happen is uWSGI will spawn several processes/workers to handle multiple incoming requests.
Also, I doubt Google really wants to be on Python. https://opensource.googleblog.com/2017/01/grumpy-go-running-python.html?m=1
Apologies, I thought I'd linked directly to that chapter. :(
Why would it dump stuff out of RAM? That's more of a CGI thing. uWSGI is going to fork several processes of your app after initializing some common components.
Ignoring the tag, Ubuntu has [announced](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BionicBeaver/ReleaseNotes#Other_base_system_changes_since_16.04_LTS) that Python 2 is no longer installed by default.
I do all my python work in docker.
RH is really shooting themselves in the foot by letting development of python based system tools languish on 2. They already face supporting python 2 through 2024 with EL7 and now with EL8 on python 2 I expect it will be 2028 or later before they stop maintaining python 2. EL7 shipped with PHP 5.4 and they are forced to backport fixes.
Use SCL https://www.softwarecollections.org/en/scls/rhscl/rh-python36/
If you use pipenv, all you need is `pipenv run`.
Backporting fixes is the largest value proposition of Enterprise distributions in the first place.
Well, with Gunicorn it'll usually look a bit like this: Client &lt;--HTTP--&gt; Nginx &lt;--Proxy--&gt; Gunicorn &lt;--WSGI--&gt; `myapp.py` Check out the Gunicorn documentation they have great examples http://docs.gunicorn.org/en/stable/deploy.html
+1, i highly recommend it... Look forward to it everytime and keep the emails for future ref
AWS Linux is already stealing business from RedHat in the cloud because their default repos support Python 3. 
It's also extraordinarily time consuming to do so when you failed to invest in up-front development in your tool-chain.
&gt; Oh really, for each request passed by WSGI, "myapp.py" restarts from zero? basjj, You do not "restart" myapp.py. You should not think about it as running a script. By referencing myapp.py you are just telling to your WSGI server where to find your application object, that it is supposed to use/publish. 
&gt; and now with EL8 on python 2 This article said the exact opposite. The next version of RHEL will be Python 3
How do I switch from 2 to 3?

Haha sorry, rookie mistake :P I'm not too sure what argparse is since I'm learning Python in a set course, and we haven't gotten to that part yet. Also, yes, the code does run, I just don't know how to put in those two files. Just not sure which line I'm meant to put the code in, and what code to use for this case.
I have python2.7 project. What's the easiest way to make it 3 compatible?
Current and last price accessed with the 'postMarketPrice' and 'regularMarketPrice' keys respectively
You shouldn’t be monkeying with the system python because parts of the OS use it, so updating the system python or it’s libraries could affect your system if the update isn’t compatible. I imagine there could be security implications but that’s not something I know enough about to speak confidently. Using virtualenv is a great choice like others have mentioned, there are 3rd party choices as well like conda which allow you to encapsulate your project python and its dependencies. 
Eh? Why? mod_wsgi is still a thing, no?
This happened to be a long post. And I will use Apache as a web server example, but you can adapt it to nginx or whatever. There are normal web servers like Apache or nginx. They 1. can run on port 80 2. handle static files efficiently But they don't know what to do with python applications (beyond simple cgi). There are specialized application servers that can run python applications. As an absolute minimum they know how to keep python interpreter in the memory, so that it does not need to be restarted it on each request. Usually application servers can also start multiple processes and handle multithreading etc. Application servers can not run on port 80, and by default they are not good in handling static files. Originally, the process looked like this: Apache &lt;-&gt; mod_proxy &lt;-&gt; Application server &lt;-&gt; python application When you request a url, this request is proxied to an application server, application server engages your python application, and response is proxied back to Apache and then returned to you. At first, application servers were not standardized. At some point people settled on WSGI specification that defined how (WSGI) applications server should interact with (WSGI) python application. Since then all python frameworks focused on creating WSGI applications that can be published by different WSGI servers. Gunicorn, waitress, wsgiref.simple_server.WSGIServer etc all are examples of applications servers that implement WSGI specification. When you do "python myapp.py" you are actually starting a development WSGI server that comes with Flask by default. And it publishes your WSGI application. This development WSGI server is very limited. That's why you need to use a real one for production. So, it is something like Apache &lt;-&gt; mod_proxy &lt;-&gt; gunicorn (WSGI server) &lt;-&gt; python WSGI application There are standalone WSGI servers, like gunicorn. And as I said, normally you proxy your requests from a web server to an application server. There are WSGI servers that are coupled with web servers. They have a special way to interact with web server machinery and get directly into request handling. So, they have like a direct bridge, and external proxying is not necessary. In this sense, mod_wsgi is coupled with Apache, and uWSGI with nginx. Apache &lt;-&gt; mod_wsgi (WSGI server) &lt;-&gt; python WSGI application Basically, this is the way to go if you are an Apache person. And believe me, configuration is not so difficult. 
The GIL doesn't have anything to do with this problem, the problem comes from "flask has a debugging server that works but it's horribly insecure and the flask team doesn't care about performance" which is why you'd kick off your process to Gunicorn or uWSGI (I'm partial to the former). Most time in servers is spent waiting on IO so the GIL doesn't even come into the picture.
+1 for pipenv! It’s awesome, and is the officially recommended Python packaging tool.
I wonder if they'll still include python2 in EPEL. It might be what stops some projects from ever moving off RHEL 7. I'm still running RHEL 6 for lots of things for other reasons.
Wow, this is good.
EL7 or bust friendo. There's light at the end of the tunnel!
Only issue is IDE sugar. Helps to have the packages on your path. Tox is a nice alt/wrapper to virtualenv.
There are companies and people that do it for you. Example me. 
http://python3porting.com/bookindex.html
Why is it better
That's a pain in the ass, because you can't just reference the python3.6 binary. ie, doing #!/usr/bin/env python3.6 can't and wont work. You need to initialize the environment.
If it's testable, you can gradually make it python3 compatible with six, backports and futures how /u/robislove suggests. To maintain compatibility with python2 while you make the change this cheatsheet is great: http://python-future.org/compatible_idioms.html 
Maybe python2 will be absorbed by systemd
supervisord has been way behind the curve but the next version is py3
I would argue that that’s a concern external to the script. The script should assume python3.6 is available in the environment and the onus is on the user to ensure that’s the case.
I think that is now the coolest Pi project I have ever seen.
those who hate are just jealous you did something. others will give you legit helpful info.
Probably, EPEL is a community project and I'm sure there will still be demand.
good, python 3 is better
This is suitable for python or really any scripting language, especially if there's a good python pdf parser out there.
right, so you need to do `scl enable rh-python36` in the parent -- which could be a bash script, could be a cron job, whatever. It's just one extra layer that makes things weird. It's still possible, just weird.
&gt; Unless I am doing something wrong You are, You can get Python36 in EPEL.
You can define functions you can use in SQL statements using [`Connection.create_function`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html#sqlite3.Connection.create_function)
Many years ago I came to a similar conclusion: Python's object interface is not obvious. The way I deal with this is: in my code I strongly prefer not to require objects created from custom classes as arguments to procedures. I don't expect library code to extend the very few classes that I do write. And, when I deal with the bad code written by someone else, I tell them so in a ticket in their bug tracker. The majority of code written in Python is garbage, the situation is the same in every other popular programming language. It's just a fact of life. I don't think it is possible to help it through making better languages, or improving one's own code. There already are better languages, and my own code is a drop in a bucket, so no matter how good it is, it won't change the situation. Conclusion? Just accept that the world is this way, and take this into account next time you plan a timeline for your project.
For the first part, "how can I run it to get data" (on a linux server) First copy the script over to the server. Then SSH into the server and set the script to executable, eg: chmod +x your_script.py Then run it, eg: ./your_script.py You also need to have Python 3 installed on the server. 
I've done from pinance import Pinance symbol = "AAPl" stock = Pinance(symbol) stock.get_postMarketPrice() print(stock.quotes_postMarketPrice() And I get a Pinance has no attribute error
The truth is, WSGI solves very little thing, but as long as all frameworks goes along with WSGI, you don't have to remember dozens of different kinds of Web interface with servers. There's no "direct* way of using Flask/Bottle/Django, they simply don't run, unless you count the dev server. All of them must go though a loop of Gunicorn/uWSGI containers to run. 
 - bottle == single file module - flask == router + werkzeug + jinja2 - django == all of the bells including a nice CRUD admin.
&gt; FFS, code is a mass noun / uncountable noun - like rice or water, you don't damn well add an "s". I think in this case, they're not using code as a word for the symbols that make up a computer program, but to the idea of various cryptographic ciphers. For example, if this book teaches how to break a Ceasar Cipher and a Vigenère Square, then it can be said to show how to break "codes". The phrase "cracking a code" is common in cryptanalysis. The book may still be bad, but the title checks with acceptable grammar.
Cherrypy does have an included production ready web server: http://cherrypy.org/ Despite being pure python, it's fast enough for most low traffic sites. 
Maybe it was because I am on mobile. But that page sure feels bloated. Loading takes forever for no obvious reason. 
I've worked for banks and various kinds of fund for most of my life. At various times in my career I have worked on option pricing software that was written in Python, so the answer to your question is Yes.
Could you elaborate a little bit how this helps with packaging? I played around with pipenv but always wondered if this would help with creating .deb or RPM packages.
saw the same lines this morning on a client's machine... sigh.
I use SCL to create the 3.6 virtualenv, then you can just use it like normal. Works great. I was highly skeptical before as I initially found it quite difficult to use.
It isn’t. It uses virtualenv internally. It does provide a nice interface for managing multiple virtualenvs and automating the creation of the virtualenvs. Basically it offers a higher level of abstraction. It is commonly used for testing and CI,
Foools! Python 2.7 4 EVER
“Officially recommended” where? Pipenv is still pretty new and nowhere near the stdlib. I’d be surprised to know it had been “blessed” in any way.
Good to know
No it's "waaaaaaah corporates don't want to change what 'works'"

by forever you mean 2020 lol
This seems like an environment activation and/or PATH related issue to me. You might be able to confirm that by the following (at least, this is how I would start trying to troubleshoot): 1. Confirm you are working in the activated environment. This means you should see '(freecad)' in your terminal. This is the activate &lt;env&gt; command. 2. Start an interactive python session in the terminal. Type 'python' 3. have a look at your path variable. import sys sys.path 4. I suspect there isn't a FreeCAD path (or the correct one is not present). If there IS the correct path, I must apologize as I wouldn't know what is wrong. However, if there is NOT a path with FreeCAD, you can (for your current interactive session) append the path to your sys.path variable. So, poke around in your installed programs to find a path to FreeCAD. I don't know specifically what path you will need, so you can try program files\FreeCAD 0.##\bin as well as \lib. Then, once you have the path, in your python terminal just do: sys.path.append('your path'). Try importing FreeCAD after each path you try. ------ If that works, it may be wise to find a way to permanently add the FreeCAD path to your PATH variable system wide. At this stage, I think you can probably figure out how to do that... assuming this was the issue. I really hope I've helped in some way. :/ :) Good luck
the 3.5 type hinting was supposed to address this. But there's a lot small problems to solve. e.g. need `import` more modules than before, possibly introducing circular dependency of modules, and thus introduce register pattern and all kinds of Enterprise™ shit. Let's hope frameworks and IDEs would catch on.
&gt; The biggest reason to not use the flask server is because it is single threaded. If you have a page that runs a SQL query that takes ~20 seconds and someone else tries to access another page on your server, they have to wait until that other request finishes and returns the rendered/jsonified information. You can pass threaded=True to app.run() which will be forwarded to [werkzeug.service.run_simple](http://werkzeug.pocoo.org/docs/0.14/serving/#werkzeug.serving.run_simple) &gt; I've found uWSGI + nginx is easier to setup than mod_wsgi in apache, especially when using python3. +1. apache + mod_wsgi is a nightmare to set up. nginx + uwsgi takes 5 minutes
I would really like to create such an app, even if only just for backtesting strategies or paper trading. Pm me if you are interested
Only if you need support.
What's it do? How do you run it?
Fundamentally you're building a looping tree. I'd probably write something like pages = { 'Intro: 'hi. Pick 1 or 2', 'Win' : 'you win', 'Die' : 'you die', } pagemap = {1:['Win', 'Die']} page = 'Intro' while page not in :['Win', 'Die']: page_str = input(pages[page] page = pagemap[int(page)] Throw some error checking and a better story and you're good to go Also, /r/learnpython

&gt; Is there some proper way to Python so that the object interface is obvious? If you're lucky, the interface is like a single method and is nicely documented. If not, it's a mess (file-like objects are one standard example that's notoriously fragile in this respect). Newer code can use [abstract base classes](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/abc.html) (also supported in 2.7) for documentation purposes and some rudimentary runtime checking.
This obviously a great tool and everyone should use it! But why not use real emojis instead of ASCII-Emoticons?
Wrong forum, imho: you should go to `r/algotrading` There are plenty of python frameworks (Don't rely on people telling you if they made money or not.

I played it for 15-20 minutes yesterday, long enough to get a grasp of the basic rules and scoring. Will keep playing it today, as it's exactly the kind of card/strategy game I enjoy. I have zero critique of the game itself, which so far is perfect, only the implementation. The README could use a brief overview of the game play. I had zero idea what kind of game I was getting into until I downloaded it and spent a few minutes reading the rules. Try reading the Wikipedia page for a handful of other games to see how their game play is broken down into 2-3 sentences. Speaking of which, the rules were buried. Only after hunting through the UPDATE.txt did I find the shortcut to show them. Even adding a "Press Ctrl+H to show the rules" line in the game itself would help. As I was learning the scoring I thought it would be very helpful if the Move History window showed why the points were allotted. Some sort of scoring breakdown, *7 points from the rule of sevens, 5 for the row not-prime, etc.* There were a few times I was estimating my score for a move ahead of time, but it was 2-3 points off. Also, I just now realized there are 2 more columns in the history panel after maximizing the game! An undo move would be helpful for learning, as would slowing down the play of the competitors so I had more time to analyze their moves. And not to throw a wrench in all the work you did with writing the rules, but I think that calling this a card game may impact its uptake. It's much more of a strategy game, and doesn't apply any typical (American) card game tactics. E.g. there's no three of a kind, and only a hint of a "flush", and so on. Since it doesn't use a standard deck of cards, asking someone to play it offline isn't as simple as "grab a deck of cards." I was thinking all night about what games to compare it to, and the best I could come up with is that it's sort of a numerical version of Scrabble combined with the strategy of a game of Go.
Interesting. But to obfuscate Python code why not just compile it to native executable?
It was really an amazing journey of Machine Learning. I have never felt bored through out the course. I have learnt ton of things from this course. And now very excited to pick my new course "Data Science A-Z &amp; Deep Learning" Thanks a lot 
Try using a do while loop to get a valid answer (while answer is not one of your three options), and then use a switch case on their answer to render an appropriate response.. or alternatively an if elseif else structure.

Google how to run a python script. You run your script and add the filename (or names) as an argument - something along the lines of python myscript.py argument1 argument2 from the command line. Basically, try googling your problem first, then if and when you have specific questions, come back and ask :-)
That's an HTML question, not a Python question. Also, it sounds like it's your homework.
That's rough. I am thankful in that we're probably getting an enhancement contract to upgrade to at least python 2.7 and from PyQt3 (back when it was just PyQt) to probably PyQt5 among other things.

You should post in /r/learnpython then.
Here's a sneak peek of /r/learnpython using the [top posts](https://np.reddit.com/r/learnpython/top/?sort=top&amp;t=year) of the year! \#1: [My new book, "Cracking Codes with Python" is now available and free to read online!](https://np.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/7sigre/my_new_book_cracking_codes_with_python_is_now/) \#2: [I'm releasing a free code for the "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python" Udemy course](https://np.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/7fxork/im_releasing_a_free_code_for_the_automate_the/) \#3: [I made a python cheat sheet](https://np.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/82t191/i_made_a_python_cheat_sheet/) ---- ^^I'm ^^a ^^bot, ^^beep ^^boop ^^| ^^Downvote ^^to ^^remove ^^| [^^Contact ^^me](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=sneakpeekbot) ^^| [^^Info](https://np.reddit.com/r/sneakpeekbot/) ^^| [^^Opt-out](https://np.reddit.com/r/sneakpeekbot/comments/7o7jnj/blacklist/)
Pythonic way (but maybe not recommended for a beginner): def my_function(): print('Please select options 1, 2 or 3:') print({ 1: 'You selected option 1', 2: 'You selected option 2', 3: 'You selected option 3', }.get(input(), "I'm sorry, that is an invalid option")
[Pyinstaller](http://www.pyinstaller.org/) I only used it on Windows, didn't test it on Linux or Mac.
&gt; Do you mean "myapp.py" will be called as a new process everytime a new request is passed by nginx to WSGI? No, the WSGI application server will load your app as a module instead of running it as a script (because that would start the integrated web server). It does not need to reload the module for each single process.
Python compiles to bytecode which is run by the interpreter. See (https://docs.python.org/3/library/language.html#python-language-services)[dis module, etc] I don't know how you compile python to a native executable, but the tool probably just bundles the interpreter which some startup modifications and your python code in text or bytecode. BTW if you drop the `exec` call in the example and write the resulting string from the inner join operation to a file or print it to the standard output you get the source again?
As a side note, you can't really avoid WSGI with any of the frameworks at all. All these frameworks always expose the web apps as WSGI apps, and even their integrated web servers serve the apps using that interface.
Why do you say that? I use the same technique as /u/420Phase_It_Up to make supervisord run python apps in virtual environments and have never had any issue.
Did you leave something out? Your code just outputs ""I'm sorry, that is an invalid option" with every input.
Nevermind, it runs with fine in Python 2.7, not Python 3.4
oops i forgot the `int` before `input()` :-)

The section on an object being its own iterator was interesting. Helped me understand how file objects work.

&gt; r/personalfinance More like /r/wallstreetbets OP is literally better off just throwing darts at a wall with post it notes that have ticker symbols on them.
Ah, I think there is some confusion. /u/420Phase_It_Up was pointing out that if you install your app inside a virtual environment then you can run it (without first activating the venv) by using the python binary inside the venv. In my case I have supervisor launch my app with something like: .venv/bin/python app.py This works great with virtual environments whether they are created with venv, conda, pipenv etc.
Pipenv basically makes it easier to manage dependencies and environments and primarily relies on PyPi packages. It helps you keep track of the specific packages you need for your project. This doesn't have a lot of influence on making .deb and RPM packages specific to your distribution. In my experience, larger distributions will actually try to avoid relying on PyPi and will have most dependencies on their own package manager. What pipenv does make easier, is that you know which python packages/libraries you need in order for a project to work in a specific environment. It is especially useful during development and deployment, in the same way that virtualenv and pip do, but with a few added features and conveniences. I personally use pipenv to deploy my to Debian servers, but I use a more recent version of Django than the one that Debian offers, so I only rely on the Debian Python and Pip versions. Once those are in place, I install pipenv with `pip install pipenv`, pull my project's codebase and install all my dependencies from my Pipfile through `pipenv install`.
I've used [zerorpc](http://www.zerorpc.io/) in the past for something similar (just a shutdown command, controlled by a password). It worked pretty well and was easy to get running. 
This sounds like a job for Flask! http://flask.pocoo.org It's a really easy to use webserver. If you want, you can forward the appropriate ports from your router and access it from the internet, (just make sure debug mode is disabled).
I think I misread their comment as "just point to the actual system binary in /usr/bin" for things that should be run in virtualenv; e.g., `/usr/bin/python` and run `/usr/bin/python /path/to/myscript.py` instead of putting things in virtualenvs. Personally what I like doing is just changing the hashbang in my python scripts to reference the virtualenv's python. E.g., first line of an executable python script `appname.py` in directory `/production/projectname/` would be: #!/production/venv_projectname/bin/python Then it can be run in supervisord or cron scripts by just invoking `/production/projectname/appname.py` (or run from inside the directory `/production/projectname` with `./appname.py`) while automatically using virtual environment's libraries. Now you could accomplish something similar by manually setting environmental variables and running like: PYTHONHOME=/production/venv_projectname /usr/bin/python /production/projectname/appname.py but that seems overly cumbersome.
You don't get the same environment if you do that. I had a bug from this with starting external scripts.
Nice breif summary of the PyPDF2 module. I have been using this module at work to find manufacture part drawings, create a watermark with vital information (Customer, Quantity, machine serial #, release date, ect...) and merge the watermark and the original drawing together, then print it out. The only issue I have been having with PyPDF2 is every so often, weird PDFs come around and I can not manipulate (rotate, scale) them.
That was a good read. Thanks for sharing. 
You call stock.get_quote() to get a dictionary with a bunch of quote data. One of the keys in the resulting dictionary is postMarketPrice (if it's after hours) So something like `data = stock.get_quote()` and then you get the price with `data['regularMarketPrice']`
oh nice! Ive been thinking of adding streaming to my crypto portfolio manager project Im playing with. Ill give this a go!
I have from pinance import Pinance symbol = "AAPL" stock = Pinance(symbol) data = stock.get_quote() a = data['regularMarketPrice'] print(a) I still get Pinance had no attribute 'get_quote'
Implementing a [Damerau-Levenshtein distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damerau%E2%80%93Levenshtein_distance) or more generally [Edit distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edit_distance) will be non-trivial (I think doing it efficiently could be a PhD topic), that's why I wanted to see if there is already an implementation, usable in Python+sqlite3.

Arduino hardware isn't really capable of running Python. The Arduino Due should be possible to support in something like [MicroPython](https://github.com/micropython/micropython), but it's not easy, especially for a beginner.

Pull Request I’d assume
Pull Request.
Ah gotcha
Ok so here's the problem: trade fees. There is not an algorithm for stocks that does not involve patience, time, and diversification. Even _if_ you can match the market, it's not worth it to do so algorithmically with quick trades because of the trade fees. Beating the market requires gambling and more fees. It's better to do too your research and invest in a low fee index fund. You don't need a computer for this. The index fund will track the best performers for you, matching the long term market growth rate. If we could predict spikes and crashes to make quick money, there wouldn't be spikes and crashes: see effecient market theory.
Are you sure? I used Pyserial module to communicate with arduino.I also saw plenty videos of people writing a small code in python [like this for example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=90&amp;v=9pEQSyG48tU). 
Unfortunately I don’t have the patience for index fund to hit 10% a year. I have daytrading experience so something along that line is what I’m looking for. Daytrading or swing trading. I did find a website called Quantopian where you can use your python programming algorithm to make paper trades and do back testing, and if your algorithm makes money then they invest and you get a return. But i would like to trade my own money in my own account so I’m looking to learn how to create algorithm for personal trading For fees I was thinking of registering with a day trade prop firm and I trade from Home 
That's running Python on your computer to send data to the Arduino, which is something you can easily do. What you _can't_ do is run Python code on the Arduino hardware itself.

I have a Master in Methods &amp; Statistics, working as a data scientist for ~4 years and run https://upfront.ai (crypto signals). I can tell you that common sense and distrusting your strategy really helps you over hiding behind mathematical formulas. And yes, you can easily make profit. My favourite statistics joke: statisticians are like artists - they tend to fall in love with their models :-) 
I’m actually studying to go towards a data science path. Currently learning the modules like seaborn, pandas and such. I’ve tried trading on my own an failed miserably so I wanted to take the algo approach since I can take the emotions out of it. I mean big market players use algos to make profit so why not individuals right? Have you tried creating a program to trade? By the way, any tips or recommendations on path to data science? I believe I have enough technical background as I have a bs in Astrophysics but no experience. Been studying on my own but not exactly sure about an efficient path 
Yeah, doesn't virtualenv take care of this?

You need a loop. I'd do something like this: user_input = "" while user_input != "quit": # do stuff user_input = input("Type 'quit' to exit: ")

I see, I'll look into how to do that if there isn't an api. This whole thing is a learning project for me. I wanted to get closer to python l, automation seemed like a good excuse to do that. 
Different use cases. One is for ease of development at the expense of scale and one is for production at the expense of configuration. 
2020 is when machines will take over, Python won't even will be needed after that
Thanks! That's a good point about overly complicated. I will probably use this approach and have the `map_to_members` method take a string method name and use `getattr` on each member to access the target method. I couldn't tell if your instance in `instance.method_for_single_member` was a member instance or the same top level instance that has `map_to_members`. If it is the same instance, I may be missing something.
Thanks, will check it out pronto 👌
Can you show us what line in your code is listed in the error traceback? Even just copy/pasting the full traceback would be helpful. Presumably somewhere your code gives Kivy a tuple where it expects a dict.
Would you mind sending me the link as well? Interested in checking it out. I'm developing my first flask app right now.
You can go straight to native with Nuitka as well: http://nuitka.net/pages/overview.html
Which line do you get the error on? I don't think many people will want to read through almost 600 lines of code. **If you are about to ask a question, please consider r/learnpython .**
If I'm reading the traceback right it suggests it found an error at runtime in GameApp().run()
Or write perl
First off, this question should really be posted to /r/learnpython This line ```AttributeError: 'tuple' object has no attribute 'items'``` implies: 1. The type of the variable is a tuple 2. You're probably expecting it to be a dictionary. Traceback would read better if you indented... You need to find where `c.pos_hint` is set and figure out why it's not a dictionary. I highly encourage you to use the [pdb](https://docs.python.org/3.2/library/pdb.html) module. When you run the next time, the program will stop and let you introspect the data. Use the following where-ever you would like to set a breakpoint (e.g. line 115 in `floatlayout.py` and where-ever you set `c.pos_hint`) and then rerun: import pdb; pdb.set_trace() pass Finally, do not use `c` as a variable name. You won't have any idea what `c` means in a couple of weeks. Use something descriptive to help your future self.
The thing is code on line 399 uses attribute `pos` which accepts a tuple whereas pos_hint accepts a dictionary and when the dictionary isn't meant to be used you need to use `None, None` without any brackets. It's a Kivy thing. But I certainly appreciate that you took time to have a look at it !
I would recommend courses on Udemy. I took some courses with Jose Portilla and they were quite good. He also has one related to financial analysis with Python. You can also check out courses by Kirill Eremenko. There are also MOOCs available on Coursera, Edx, etc.. than can help with your path to Data Science.
Bazinga!
I know that. Descriptive variable names are MUST in programming. I don't know why the traceback says I'm using it as I'm not using it anywhere in my code.
On line 519 you set `pos_hint: None, None`. This is wrong, pos_hint should be a dict.
/r/flask might be a better place to ask. I think most people who need/write tutorials end up working with Django, because it's got so much more basic functionality built in. 
Actually, I am currently building a cryptocurrency trading not, but it would be able to plug into an etrade API if I wanted it to. It is a lot harder than it seems, and a lot harder than I thought it would be going in. The easy part is building the framework. the hard part is getting it to make good decisions. You start with a strategy, but then getting it to follow that strategy is not easy. I've had to learn a lot of calculus, statistics, game theory and quantitative analysis, when I went into this I thought I'd follow some trend signals and wait for certain triggers. Its not a big deal, since I'm the type that absolutely gobbles that shit up, but still. There are open source crypto, forex and stock trading libraries and tools out there for python. There are communities that work on algorithms together. You may be able to save yourself a lot of time by looking into them, using some of that code, or working with other people, or getting ideas from what they did. I wish I had done that before I dove in alone, but I enjoy the process so its not all bad.

A question if you're willing to answer, are you calculating based on Brownian motion and if so, is it generally accurate? I don't want to get your strategies or anything, but I've avoided using Brownian motion/Weiner process because from what I understand it isn't actually analogous to the movements of real markets.
Ah, I see - you want to do a blanket call to a method that or may not exist on the members. Using `getattr` seems like the right plan then. A question you may want to ask yourself: why do you need to call methods that may not exist? Is there a way to make the interfaces of the members the same? If not, why do you want to be able to treat them like they are? If you want them to act the same but they have different interfaces, that's somewhat contradictory, and might be where the underlying code smell is.
I have built small websites with little database integration with flask earlier. So thought e-commerce would be the ideal project to further my web development skills. A tutorial that doesn't show the code but at least lays down the roadmap is totally fine with me.

How well does this work detecting things like weaponized PDFs?
`{None, None}` is syntax for a set, not a dict. Just use `pos_hint: {}`, the empty dict has no pos_hint instructions and so will be ignored.
This https://kivy.org/docs/api-kivy.uix.relativelayout.html confirms it.

To run the script, you have to get rid of the obfuscation.
The submembers may evolve to needing that method in the future if a feature requires it for now its optional. This is in a GUI and its about propagating a state change to all the widgets that may need to update based on that application state. Depending on what the state update is, either all members or just a subset of them will have an `update_for_state_X` method. There are currently some that all the members have. I opted for EAFP for that reason, seemed cleaner but maybe you have other ideas?

&gt; This is obviously a great tool and everyone should use it! But why not use real emojis instead of ASCII-Emoticons? It's not the usage of ASCII emoticons that annoys me; that's a perfectly fine use case for a utility. However the usage of the terms `emoji` and `emojify` while the project is clearly dealing with ASCII emoticons rather than emoji. This package should really be renamed to `emoticonify_python_script` so as not to conflict with anyone who writes a **real** python emojification utility or confuse anybody who may be looking for one. This is flat-out misleading.

Is it alright if I provide some sample code for using rolling averages with group by statements? Refactoring along these lines may help, and I'm also not certain that I perfectly understand what you're looking to do. At any rate, give this a shot: import numpy as np import pandas as pd # Configure test dataframe. df = pd.DataFrame({'a' : np.random.rand(10), 'b' : np.random.rand(10)}) df['grpby'] = [0] * 5 + [1] * 5 # Groupby column with rolling mean. df_grouped_rolling = df.groupby('grpby')[['a', 'b']].rolling(window=3, min_periods=2).mean().reset_index() df_grouped_rolling.rename({'a' : 'a_mean', 'b' : 'b_mean'}, inplace=True) df_grouped_rolling.head(10) That makes a rolling average (from random data) of each `grpby` category (In this case 0 and 1). It will also provide you with a new dataframe, so you'll be able to avoid the problems you have with copying.
Yo dawg I heard you like services. So I put Python as a Service in your service starting service so you python your service while you service your service starting service.
The typical model would be [the observer pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern). In that case, you send a message to each observer from the observee that tells them what changed. They then choose to respond to it however they want.

Thanks for the help, and I understand that I should go to the learn python subreddit, therefore I won't reply here anymore, but I may read the comments
we were trying to install LXC, which has decent (python3) tools and crappy (bash script) tools, but only the crappy ones would work on centos7. I just could not get it working - starting with the fact that LXC expected the python3 binary to be called python3, which it wasn't, and it just got worse from then on out
I don't agree with my colleague, please help me out: At work we decided to put up an MySQL database to store ~15-20 tables with some different one-to-many and many-to-many relations. Great! I've used SQLAlchemy a lot so I decided to use the SQLAlchemy ORM to define all mapping classes in a database.py file. I was feeling so happy because now all other teams in our company could import the database.py and have a easy life making queries and interact with our database. BUT then my colleague argued "you should never expose the database implementation and tables-layout, etc.." and he said instead we need to develop a REST API for our database that the other teams should use instead, so we can modify the database tables without breaking their code. I think this is overkill. What is the point of the ORM if you can never use it ... since in the future, you "might change the database structure". What do you think about this problem?
The best way for me to understand something is to actually start doing stuff, so this is awesome. Thanks for sharing.
Braintree's example is written in Flask https://github.com/braintree/braintree_flask_example

Yes.
That's what pyinstaller does, but you can use cython which translates every file into cpython, then compiles it using your compiler into shared libraries for each file (.so/.pyd). Python can then import the shared library just like it would any normal python file.

[Full Python 3 Library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/) At a quick glance I can't see anything that's supplied as default for database connections. Like you, I've always had to install something additional via pip. 
Are you going from 0 to python or do you have previous programming experience? How many hours of that week can you dedicate to python?
Welp after going down the braintree path for about two weeks and getting no where I was able to switch to Stripe and using an old API (2.1.0) I was able to wrap the Java successfully and integrate a payment option in my app. I might look into making a garden module for stripe once I get my project finished so anyone can integrate payment into their app.
Yeah, I saw it was included in 3 but didn’t do too much digging. I may have to look into that module some more. I’m not sure if it’s compatible with the Microsoft SQL database we have.

Gunicorn runs your app. It's as simple as running `gunicorn myapp.py` instead of `python myapp.py`. 
They have a point, though if it's strictly inside your own company, where's the trust bro! JK. A rest API is still not bad (and nothing is keeping you from using the ORM inside the api) The advantage is any language could use it then, not just python. I vote RestAPI and fight a different battle. 
OR... ctypes for the win? Best of both worlds huh huh :)
I see. Haven't worked with Kivy so I didn't expect that it'd only be able to list the main loop's initialization. My bad
yea helped me out reminded me theres a udemy sale rn this course is actually decent too
I don't think it would be too hard since you can get the `emoji` package with pip. I may take a stab at it lol.
Datacamp has great python courses. The basic and intermediate python course give you a pretty good basic understanding of what python is and how it works. They have a lot of basic courses and some pretty advanced ones. 
Why not just emotify?
I'd start by reading Wes McKinney's _Python for Data Analysis,_ then Andreas Mueller and Sarah Guido's _Introduction to Machine Learning with Python._
Everything I have starred in Github could be asked this question.
Please ask /r/learnpython abstract solution for a console app: in a loop sleep 500ms, peek for keyboard event, if there is one, add to a buffer string, if total time reaches the limit, break out of the loop by returning None. Otherwise if user entered &lt;enter&gt;, return whatever they typed in and validate the input. 
Asking the important questions. I like emotify.
Such emoticon.
Thanks for the info! Will do ASAP
Yo, are those controls NERC-CIP? If so, blocking external libraries is bullshit. There's nobody in the world who's done a full security review of the entire Python 3 standard lib, so if it passes then you'd be able to use pip libs as well. 
What do you WANT to do? 
The official Cython docs have notes on how to integrate with NumPy: http://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/userguide/numpy_tutorial.html
&gt; RG 1.152 RG 5.71 Figured it was. Tell them it's a business need and have them prove out that it's not secure. You have a right to have them justify their "no", else they don't have a leg to stand on. 
The question always comes up as “who is going to pay for it?” We are trying to convince them to let us import the wheel files but no telling how much time that would take. 
Pay for the process of getting it approved, going through paper work, changing any current policy in place, etc... If they don’t have a charge number, they won’t do the work. Working for large companies, there’s so much buerocracy it’s almost impossible to get any work done.
This is really amazing!!! 
The question is quite vague and the possibilities are limitless.

I realize I’m late to the party, but maybe someone will come across my comment. I wrote a web GUI for svn repo logs. It started out as a way to do analytics against our svn commits. But then I realized I’m always dumping out our commits to search through them, so I wrote a front end. On install it dumps all commits to xml and then converts them to insert statements in the Postgres backend. Then subsequent updates just load any new commits via the same process based on the last commit in the db. I used Flask, bootstrap, and a lot of JavaScript, at least a lot more than I’m used to writing. We tag each commit with a Zendesk ticket, so I extract it with some regex and display it the link to the ticket under each commit message. I also put in some basic reporting with Pygal. Also I wrote a diff module to diff any files in a particular commit against the last rev by clicking the link. This is a huge time saver! Funny thing about the project is it only works with SVN but I used git to keep track of the code changes for the app. Showed it to the CEO. He was blown away by it and couldn’t believe I had developed the whole thing by myself. He wants me to deploy it for all our repos eventually. 
Wow.... That's crazy... My condolences.

The value of memory space reuse due to pre-forking in a Python based application is heavily overrated. Any value quick evaporates in practice because of how all objects in Python are reference counted, and that even executing Python code causes reference counts on the code objects to be manipulated. So as soon as you access objects in a memory page, or Python code in it is executed, you end up with a copy of that memory in your own process anyway. So loading your Python application and only then forking out processes doesn't have the great benefits that many people believe it does. All you save on is a bit of start up time as only loading the code once. Loading code in a process and then forking also exposes you to various other traps. For example, code which tries to be smart and pre-recreate connections to databases at global scope. Those open connections get inherited by all the sub-process and they will interfere with each other. Another it take locks on external resources before forking, meaning sub-processes can trample on each other as they all think they have exclusive access. So you have to be very careful when running application code for a web application before the web server processes are forked off. Not all WSGI servers actually work that way. It isn't done in mod_wsgi because of the dangers it can create. In uWSGI it is optional. When a WSGI server does support it, you then have to deal with WSGI server specific callbacks to delay application initialisation until after the fork, resulting in your code then being locked into that specific WSGI server and how it works, thus loosing the portability promise of the WSGI specification.
You already had those circular dependencies, the typing system is just making it painfully obvious. It's like getting lemon juice on a paper cut you didn't notice.
While it's primary focus is testing, it allows you to quickly define and switch between different environments within a single project quite easily. Want to run in dev mode with dev dependencies? `tox -e dev`. Want to just run a linter (only installing flake8)? `tox -e lint`. How does it look in prod mode? `tox -e prod`. It's kinda like make or npm for python, but cleaner.

I'm planning on making a neural network that can identify cats from dogs, then hopefully turning that into a website 
... I can't tell if you're joking or seriously haven't wrapped your head around how it works. It doesn't obfuscate it... it just changes the script to literally be the exec(...) stuff... so if the bad guys have the "obfuscated" script then they also have the way to reverse it. This is like a high school level attempt at obfuscation. 
There are a few apps that compile python into a native executable (py2exe, cx-freeze, etc). They can still be undone by a properly motivated attacker, but obviously it makes it more difficult.

Your could have done this by using perl instead.
When I started learning Python, I made a social media website in Flask. That was what really got me understanding the intricacies of developing websites in Python. I look back, though, and I really wish I made it in Django. I would recommend you to make this ecommerce site in Django. It really would be a better choice.

A reasonable fear. Who are internetsociety.org guys anyway?
It some something I saw over a decade ago, sorry. IIRC it was a bot that connected to a custom irc server in brazil. I finally decoded the creds and logged in, but not actual people were on so I got bored. 
My degree is in cyber security. I didn't get a job in cyber security because the jobs in infosec are very sweatshoppy. So, I treat it like a degree in Psychology -- a degree I got because I like the topic. Blackhat Python kept me interested enough to get past that 'initial hump'. I went from contracted intern to sr. software developer because I went into the internship with a lot of coding knowledge, but I didn't know how much I knew until I saw how much people in the game for 15+ years didn't know. Anyway, I think the best defense against an unethical hacker is an ethical hacker who knows how to hack unethically. Take that how you wish, but you obviously know what constitutes as 'pen testing' and 'malicious activity' as a cyber securist.
I don't know what compiler you were using, but with your comment I went back and checked the spacing. It's not that you needed to convert your tabs into spaces, it's that you needed to synchronize all your tabulations. Your tabulations cannot be mix-n-matched. As you know, Python's very dependent on its tabbing. Also, review this for fun: https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/06/15/developers-use-spaces-make-money-use-tabs/

A rest API is still not bad (and nothing is keeping you from using the ORM inside the api) The advantage is any language could use it then, not just python. I vote RestAPI and fight a different battle. This is a DBA problem. Exposing what or what is not should be handled by permissions and etc. But eventually, as the software gets complex and more and more people needs info from your db. you'll eventually need to wrap everything in an API.

Don't take this the wrong way but I'm actually curious as to how you *didn't* know what a pull request is. I guess I forget that git really is a skill worth putting on your resume :P
You need multi threading, and call each script as a thread/process from one method. There are a couple of threading/multiprocessing modules that will help with this. This can get messy with printing/logging to the same console, so you'd also want a process that queues outputs before they display.
Haha. Really I just read it wrong in my head. Once someone told me I went and saw the pull request on the repo.
sqlite isn't a database compatibility layer, it's it's own database. If you can store the data in sqllite, instead of MSSQL you're ok.

Seems like you were in the same position i’m in...I can relate to the sweatshoppy feeling. What other steps or what else did you start learning to get you to where you are from majoring in cyber security to becoming a software engineer? Also is blackhat python pretty much everything I need to get started in the field of ethical hacking in cyber sec?

It really runs everything inside the browser. The downside of course is that the web page is embedding an entire Python interpreter, so it's way too heavyweight to use on random web pages.
Thus led to a feature request against github: pull requests should be able to contain proposed repository settings, including a recommended _rename_.

First of all, thank you so much for playing it. Honestly, knowing someone, somewhere experienced makes it feel that much more worth it. I had a friend tell me to update the readme with a description and other information about the game like you said (ctrl-h for the rules, some kind of explanation). I have a day off in the next couple days and I want to make sure I get those topics covered. The future of the move history is going to be where clicking a move on the list will show the board and card/tile played and designation of how it was scored in a clear, visual manner. I might add an undo feature and disable it during two or more humans playing. As for calling it a card game and the messy rule set, you're probably right. I created the game originally playing around with a deck of Uno cards and it only became tiles once I had to fit it into a computer resolution. The hardest part about all of this has absolutely been trying to find a way to talk about it because I don't know what to compare it to either. Rules, moves, terms... very difficult to condense it. The final rules are so much clearer than the first draft, but I know I'll need to revise a little. I'll change it from "Card Game" to "Strategy &lt;Something&gt; Game". Seriously, thank you for playing it long enough to grasp the rules and legitimately try and play it. I will be taking some of your advice very soon. Eventually, I add a couple updates to expand the gameplay like using an 11x11 board for bigger games and making the AI smarter. I've been told it's like Scrabble, Go, Battleship... but it came to me when I was spending a lot of time thinking on Conway's Game of Life and Cribbage. Ever since I built this game, I have two other variations on 7x7/11x11 boards with the non-standard card deck, so maybe I'll put them out sometime. Thank you once again, PM me a special name you like and I'll add it to the random list of computer player names.
[`virtualenv`](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/) (or [`venv`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)) only deal with isolating python (`pip`) packages, not the underlying python executable binary that runs these packages. The confusingly similarly named [`pyenv`](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) will download &amp; compile binaries for you from scratch (or if you want to be non-standard, can also be used just for isolating python packages without creating a new binary) For even more (not recommended) fun, `virtualenv` can also be configured to inherit system packages so you'll have a mix of system + custom installed packages in the same environment. Yeah, it's a [mass of confusion](https://stackoverflow.com/a/41573588/6653190). In practice almost the deployment I've seen use one of: * A system python executable + `virtualenv` * A `pyenv`-compiled executable + `virtualenv` 
inb4 "That's Frankenstein's monster, not Frankenstein himself!!!" Cool effect, though!
I suggest use of 2to3 or mechanize to convert it to 3. Do it in small increments. You’ll have to fix up the code to be optimal. Things like `dict.keys()` returns a lazy iterator in 3, so tools like 2to3 take a conservative approach and translate Python 2: all_keys = set(mapping.keys()) for key in mapping.keys(): ... To: all_keys = set(list(mapping.keys())) for key in list(mapping.keys()): ... You end up removing the extra casts from time to time: all_keys = set(mapping.keys()) # keys() now returns a set-like # object (read only). for key in mapping: ... That would accomplish your goal of a port, as opposed to dual support which is a lot more awful for complex projects.

Oh this is wonderful. Just check out the results difference between looking up 'Django'. [Old](https://pypi.python.org/pypi?%3Aaction=search&amp;term=django&amp;submit=search) All the way at the bottom of the page after 500+ results, sits Django the framework at weight 1. It's listed beneath every single library that *depends on it*. I never understood how search worked on PyPI of yore, I just used Google to look things up. [New](https://pypi.org/search/?q=django) It's the top result, as it should be. I think wonderful might be understating it; imagine being able to find Python packages without wading through google results, stack overflow answers, and blog entries. I think I might be able to take a vacation with all the freetime I will soon be having.

I don't really use duck typing for my own objects for this reason. Instead I use multiple (base) classes, kinda like mixins. It gets a bit easier with the type system though.
I would definitely recommend Django. With Flask you have to build everything from scratch yourself which is fun at first but gets tiresome later. Check out the book 'Django by example too' lots of good recipes i there including one for an ecommerce site using celery which is pretty interesting.

Unless you have a very advanced use case you may not even need to use a library (although there are apparently some good ones).
Could you elaborate on how is Python "categorically better"?
I would, but sadly both my time and reddits comment length are limited.
No they aren't. Bitbucket also uses them
Of my 3 packages, if you search for their exact names, one shows up (as the only result), one is buried (but it is a generic name, in fairness), and one has 0 results (although I only uploaded yesterday so maybe it hasn't been indexed yet). I need some SEO.
Ok, I am curious now. What are your packages?
Put it on https://pastebin.com/, describe what the code *should* do, and also, post on /r/learnpython instead of here.
Post your code to pastebin and then post the link. We can then look at your code. 
Ok thanks, will do that. Can I pm you if I have done that? 
In that order: 1. smalldataviewer, a python library and command line program for viewing small 3D image stacks from a variety of file formats 2. coordinates, a Mapping subclass with math operators defined, for dealing with coordinates in arbitrary orders (made because one of my projects straddles two libraries, one with C and one with Fortran ordering) 3. tempcase, a parent class for unittest TestCases with utilities for generating and cleaning up temporary directories for unit tests which dump out files, for people who for some reason aren't allowed to use pytest
I think telnetlib will work for you: [https://docs.python.org/3.1/library/telnetlib.html](https://docs.python.org/3.1/library/telnetlib.html). 
Give what pandas does, I think it's OK if I ask whether you memory and performance measurements?
Why can't you cite the license like stated in the "License notices" section of https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-howto.en.html? Aside from that I also suggest you review your directory structure, like sticking your .py files and config csvs into their own directories and load the program as a module from a shell script.

but why?
Look into PyInstaller.
I don't guarantee I can find the problem, but I will take a look at it for you
I don't have any at this point. But I tested it using 5 S&amp;P500 constituents tick-by-tick data for a week. Python blows up. C++ runs 
Yeah, I looked into that. But, even that requires the user to have Python first right?
Reddit Is Fun has a modal that pops up for times like that
Almost no-one uses them, they're not likely to suddenly get more popular any time soon, and every feature takes up time and effort that could be used for other things. There are some plans around integrating The Update Framework (TUF) with PyPI instead, to improve security. There's more about that in [PEP 458](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0458/).

I haven't looked at the code but I noticed a lack of examples. These kinds of packages really thrive on their ease of use and extensive documentation. If you want people to use this, you should probably aim for this next. A bit of documentation and a few examples can go a long long way! I really like the idea. I often wish there was matplotlib/numpy/scipy alternatives for C++ so I didn't have to have a scripting language and a heavy lifting language.
No, it doesn't. I tested it by building an exe with it on a Windows machine of a Python app (also using PyQt 5, and an external C library), and then running it on a fresh install of Windows with absolutely nothing except the OS installed. It worked perfectly.
On most benchmarks JavaScript (Node.js version) is about 10 times faster than any version of CPython. Other than that, these two languages are in the same ballpark, there's no real difference in terms of code size / libraries available etc. Neither can really execute code in parallel, both have optimized implementations of regular expressions and XML parsers either built into the language or available as 3rd party libraries. Both have extensive libraries for high-level networking and text processing. I don't see any significant reason to choose one over the other.
I admit, I need documentation and will add in the future. But there is an example program with a lot of examples in it at https://github.com/hosseinmoein/DataFrame/blob/master/src/datasci_tester.cc. Also I have 2 articles in Linkedin about it at https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/pythons-pandas-c-update-hossein-moein/.

A cmake interface would also help with adoption.
For those (Like me!) who hate posts that don't say what the damn thing DOES, here's what I found way, waaaaay down on their page: Cerberus Cerberus is a lightweight and extensible data validation library for Python Maybe someday people will realize that a fanciful name isn't enough?
Thanks for the info thats what I figured. I'm actually surprised to see gpg signature being deprecated since I've always considered gpg relivant. What is being used for signing now in place of it? 
Then why are you interested in data sciences if you dont like ot? Do what you like. You wont succeed in a field full of people who eat, breath and sleep what they do because they live it. Whst do you love and take easily to? Make a job of that.
Thanks a lot, I'll try with mod_wsgi then. I searched a little bit and found a few, but do you have a preferred tutorial for Python Flask + mod_wsgi + Apache that helped you to master it?
Making it easier to use the NodeMCU/ESP8266. It’s the cheapest WiFi board I can find ($3) and I think it has potential to bring the power of IoT to every kid in America. I’d love your feedback on my project: https://packagecart.com/item/microjoule-tools-for-micropython
Have you looked at the apache arrow project? How do you see your project relating to it? 
Nice man! I'm a noob to python and programming in general and was taking to making a simple discord bot as my first project. congrats on your bot! 
imo, programming is not easy.. it takes lot of time to get used to and learning never stops.. here's some motivation for you * [If you want to learn you'll need to be willing to look stupid](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/5jm97p/if_you_want_to_learn_youll_need_to_be_willing_to/) * [Techniques for Efficiently Learning Programming Languages](http://www.flyingmachinestudios.com/programming/learn-programming-languages-efficiently/) * [Things you might encounter in your programming journey](https://www.techinasia.com/talk/27-things-started-programming) 
I'm someone who's neutral to fond of JS, and considers it largely equal to Python for a lot of uses. JS was awful even 5 years ago but it's a lot better now. Honestly, you can do this happily in either language, and I'd recommend sticking to whichever you know best. But when it comes to "why would you prefer Python?", these are the three big things I would point to. 1. Python's standard library is excellent; JavaScript's is miserable. This isn't a problem if you can lean on third-party packages, which you usually can. But if you're distributing your program to other people, it can be nice to know they can just run it in the standard environment and there's no chance of something going wrong in a dependency you weren't aware of -- especially the case if you have a dependency that calls on C code (common example: SQLite3) where users especially on Windows can lack the tooling needed to build them. 2. Control flow is simple by default, with everything you're likely to find being synchronous. The JS async event-based model is great for UI stuff and great for common server activities (respond to HTTP request, make database query, etc) but is an awkward fit for a lot of other stuff. If you find yourself spending a significant amount of time organising queues, rate limits, promise chains, etc, Python will make things simpler. 3. The tooling/build process/task list/etc can be simpler. This really depends on what your project is, and a lot of the time the projects that require actually complex builds are things that Python won't be doing anyway (ie browser-side stuff), but still. You're more likely to just distribute your code as-is in Python and not have to worry about a proper Webpack/Babel/etc setup. 
If you don't just enjoy seeing things happen as a result of writing code, it's probably not for you.

It is possible. Iconosquare just released autoposting functionality for Instagram 
At the moment, there's not really any way to sign packages. The wheel package format does describe a way to have signatures embedded in the zip file, but I haven't heard of anyone using it. If the TUF work goes ahead, it could provide ways for packages to be signed by developers (see PEPs 458 and 480). Signing packages isn't all that useful without an architecture to establish which keys you trust to sign which packages, which is massively more complicated.
Yes, and briefly chatted with Wes about it. From my personal understanding, the arrow project is designed to be the "under the hood" for Pandas. It is designed to make Pandas more scalable and efficient. My goal is more to provide a C++ interface for this kind of functionality to be used in C++ environment 
This seems like a huge step backwards in many ways. No more GPG signatures, no more uploading via the web interface which I was forced to do because the API was (probably still is)? broken in certain use cases. Why disable the web upload feature? You think bots can't use the API to do malicious things? Otherwise to be fair, I do like the new look and most of the new features. The search via license type is very welcomed. The search results are relevant although the older site beats it by a bit in my highly un-scientific test.
They're called Merge Requests on GitLab though, which I think is a much better name.
