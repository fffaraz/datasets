You should have flipped the image for higher comedic value.
OK Satan.
I usually think verbosity kills readability.
How detailed do you make your variable names? Is there guideline to it? My variable names are usually two word longs, sometimes it is 4-5 words.
Absolutely. I’m willing to bet it does much better than a human for sure.
Increase your font size, or put more than one window side by side. If you have extra screen space and you're not using it then that's your problem. Don't make it harder for me to read your code.
80 column screens haven't been a thing for the entire 30 years I have been using computers. At work we loosely use 120. My feeling is that word wrap has been a thing for just as long and that code width is a display issue and should be treated as such. The way I use tools like VS the width of my code windows are different when coding and debugging and so there will never be an ideal code width. The other thing to consider is diffing but I think the correct solution there is syntax aware diff tools.
I wrote a script that parses bro logs off of the network for domains in a DNS A/AAAA query and then feeds them in to endgame’s DGA-domain generation algorithm typically used by malware-classifier. I classified the domain as “is_dga” or “not_dga” and re-enriched the bro logs with that field. Finally, I dumped them in to elasticsearch. It was mostly effective, albeit not perfect, and saved doing OSINT on funky looking domains being queried on the network.
Was a 100 chars length defender for so long, now I starting to rethink it and settle for 80. Perfect balance between readability and efficiency. We still enforce 100 char at work with autopep8 and agressive yapf, and that damn rocks it’s world, every contributors are forced to align on the code style of the project but can still disable it from time to time. Less time arguing about code style, pep8 is very useful.
This might be awful, but I set my font size so that 80 characters totally fills exactly 1/2 the screen. I'm pretty dogmatic, because of that.
The best argument for he 80 column rule is that it lines up very nicely with the optimal reading column width. Simply put, any number of columns much greater than 80 will make the text harder to read. A few references for those that like them. https://baymard.com/blog/line-length-readability https://www.researchgate.net/publication/234578707_Optimal_Line_Length_in_Reading--A_Literature_Review https://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/3618/ideal-column-width-for-paragraphs-online https://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/108801/what-is-the-best-number-of-paragraph-width-for-readability https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/questions/13724/recommended-column-width-for-text-reading-digital-vs-printed
Plutalsight and Lynda, probably the best choice for online learning.
But 120 width is bad for readability as it is to wide for the eye to track easily. So you're really sacrificing readability by moving to 120, not enhancing it.
After using black with python I now look for formatters for every language I use. The space fixing alone is worth it

What in the world is “green, yellow, red”? Is that a sublime thing?
True ‘dah' ! It's anoying. The width of a "smart phone" , Most developer don't have to Hack something on their wrist watches to get Ethan Hunt out of a jam :-/
2 main reasons I see lines longer than 80: code golfing something on to one line or a string literal mixed with code.
I just can't use pep8, if it was just a couple things I didn't like I would just block those but it's way too many things that don't make sense to me so I guess I'll just use my own rules.
Whenever you're looking at guidelines it is helpful to remember these things * Programs are mainly for humans, a computer doesn't really care at all about the structure of your program. The lexer/parser will accept whatever is valid syntax. * Programs are a specialized form of written communication (like prose, poetry, report, letter etc). The structure here is meant to communicate the intent more easily. For programs the main intent to be communicated is the flow of logic in the underlying algorithm. Whichever format communicates this logic in the best possible manner should be chosen. * Just like written communication the success depends on both the reader and the writer. For programs also it is important to remember that a structure that communicates the logic clearly for you may not be that clear for others. This is why guidelines are helpful somewhat to make the code consistent. However by no means these are written in stone, if your code is better communicated by only "violating" the guidelines than by all means do it. * The 80 character limit has its origin in the punch cards of old days so it is by no means a definitive limit. With python the more important thing is the strict indentation enforcement. In these cases having a character limit makes sure you're not writing "arrow code" (deeply nested structure). So if you hit this limit it maybe worthwhile to check if you can write the code in an alternative way that avoids this.
It's also not without precedent. For example, FITS headers are 80x36 characters, so they wrap nicely in a terminal can can be human readable even though they are binary files.
This is also really helpful when reviewing PRs on a web page. You rarely get the full screen size and if you need to scroll sideways to see the entire line, something is going to get missed.
https://github.com/kenneth-reitz/white (black supports 79 line width now)
So this was written when the majority of displays were 800x600 pixels. Now things are about 300%x200% more than that. Should we blindly be beholden to recommendations that were made nearly 20 years ago at a different time, in a different context, for reasons that no longer apply?
No it's not, if anything it's too long. Code should expand vertically, not horizontally. Why are you indenting 4 levels deep? Extract blocks out into functions or context managers. Why do you have expressions with so many nested sub expressions? Extract those out into variables and give them names. Why are your list comprehensions and function definitions and function calls all on jammed one line? These have parentheses/brackets/braces which allow you to span them across multiple lines. Shorter lines are an encouragement to write cleaner code, they mean you can have side by side diffs that fit on your screen, you can have multiple buffers open side by side. If messing with formatting is the problem, then use a code formatter.
One of the reasons I wrote the article was because I couldn't find any material about this specifically. When you bring together good design principles, this pattern just naturally falls out IMO, so if you've been programming for a while you'd naturally gravitate towards it. I wanted to try to turn what intuitively felt write into prescriptive rules for when to do it.

Why use that instead of just easily changing the config for Black?
What you need is a font that only shows half the character.
Your advice doesn't always cover every situation. One situation that comes to mind is test methods - a longer test method name can be more descriptive, but there's no way to break a test method name across multiple lines. Another one is tabular data. I often find myself defining tables as pipe-delimited text. If a pipe-delimited table expands past 80 characters, I find it's much better to leave it as it is then to try and break it up *just* for the purpose of fitting under 80 chars.
You're talking about different things. What you want to avoid are things like single letter variables, i.e. code golfing. However, you also don't want to make your code convoluted.

*Buy a larger monitor!*
I think this depends on your installation/version of flake8. The version my instructor requires limits to 80 (which is super annoying when my line was 82 char)
120 to 160, depending on the language, is usable. Short just isn't.
I’m a fan of 80 characters. It’s enough most of the time. And makes things more
Ok. Could you please define "IDE" and describe why vsc is not an IDE?
Good code reviewers would disagree.
I think 80 is good for that reason and root regular code readability, but I think they should update the rule to be 80 or 120 if there are string literals in the line. Because writing good exceptions or logging is a pain in the ass at 80 and can encourage shitty truncated messages.
I knew it was going to be this video! I made this required watching for new hires at my last job.

...except a significant part of the linewidth is empty space because of indentation.
Heavily nested code is not recommended anyway. Better make a function instead.
That is taken into account. 80 column width is actually to wide, but once you factor in that most code will have a bit of indentation it works out.
Understood. It turns out that your recommendation was exactly what I needed, though. The output of this particular method is a sequence of human-readable float values with, selectably, just one or two decimal points of precision. (My program controls another program, and, stupidly, the other program behaves differently if it gets a long string of digits after the decimal point.) I’ve been writing Python code for the better part of ten years, but there’s always new stuff to learn!
I ignore this rule. Pretty much the only pep8 rule I ignore. My code is always 120 because of my screens.
I am learning python in this very moment. I am following the python tutorial from the official docs written by guido vam rossem.
Second this one.

I like it because python is a language that’s very sysadmin as well. So when using a terminal and edit files with Vim. This limit is great. Or you could use it to have multiple files next to each other. I think for other languages that’s originally made with GUI in mind line C# or Swift. Then I don’t mind using more horizontal space.
I can think of much worse ways to spend a Friday!

Why use all these things when you can change the config of flake8 (or any other tool)? When you go this deep into the rabbit hole conformity is starting to matter, I guess

Not specifically though they do cover reading a variety of material with different purposes (not just pure prose) and they uniformly find similar results. There is evidence that it is a physical restraint on the eye movement required to scan the text. If it is a physical restraint then the content of the text would make no difference.
Right I just don't get mentioning what black can do while also linking to a separate package that does the same thing with one difference.
I'm already in the church of vim :(
I'm _tremendously_ unsurprised that he would publish something this dumb.
Just use implicit line continuations and string concatenation. test_url = ('https://project.subdomain.google.com.virus-company.com' '/database-id-09f91102/2019-05-10' '/title-in-url-that-does-not-match-article-title' '?tracker-id=todd-davis-ssn-457-55-5462')

 invoice = Mainwindow.Invoice text = invoice.Name.text() + invoice.Line_Today.text() invoice.Line_ID.setText(text) Don't use more than two `.`'s is a good rule.
You forgot a closing bracket on your first line. Python is expecting to find something that would normally go inside a bracket on line 3 and when it hits the if statement it bails out. Sometimes it pays to check before the line that is printed in the error!

I'll have to dig into it more but the specifics of code is that it is far more dense in terms of content than most material as well as longer lines being easier to read if they aren't broken up. This is all assuming the person reading it is competent enough to understand it (i.e. has experience with the language, constructs of the domain, and other personal idiosyncrasies).
Also you should sub to r/learnpython
Do you have an IDE that highlights lines based on length? Your use of stoplight colors makes me think it's literal and that sounds useful.

It sucks when you don't know much code, I found it really hard to stay engaged when I couldn't find interesting things.

pip is something you run from a command line (cmd.exe), not from withing a python program.
My experience in large organizations with a large codebase is that unless the formatter is directly integrated into the tool chain (either rejected by code review or auto format hook) then things get very messy very fast. So while it might be ok to be flexible for your own projects, you really need hard and fast rules that can be enforced automatically in some cases.

Perfectly balanced,
There is no 100% answer. We currently use 130 on my team, and I've seen as high as 160 in the past. The number itself is less important than the team agreement.
I use IntelliJ IDEA for python, go, javascript, etc.

vscode is not integrated with every aspect of my development environment. i would have to rely on some third party tool or manually do perform them. an IDE hooks into everything from development, deployment, reading and writing documentation, static analysis and code sniffing, scm, refactoring, testing, debugging, database management, api experimentation. i don't have to leave my IDE when developing except when googling something. jetbrains IDEs even come with context-aware terminals if you have to or want to do something manually im a power user. i use just about every feature of the IDE that i know about. not everyone is like that, so the line is less clear, but vscode is not an IDE because it can't do everything i need it to. it has lots of cheap and close approximations through plugins, but it is still lacking also, Microsoft says it's not an IDE
Thx for the answer. I understand better the change from setup.cfg to pyproject.toml. For now, I'm still not entirely convinced by the cursors between the advantage of this new standard and the drawback of a new standard. But I have a better aknowledge of both sides.
Any number of *filled* columns more than 80 may be harder to read. But when 20 of those characters are empty space because of indentation, the limitation becomes ridiculous.

pep8 and /r/learnpython
Thanks, checking it out now, it is indeed a good talk. Glad to have gotten three serious (and helpful) response from my jovial post. Perhaps the fear of being pep8'd is too real :)
I'm up to using emacs as my wm
Jetbrains is the 1 stop shop for everything. CLion is fantastic to use because all your favorite shortcuts/refactorings/etc from Intellij are there. Like someone else said, just get the ultimate license to cover all languages.
Plus searching for "python style guide" gets a lot of hits mentioning pep8.
The instructions were unclear and this caused me many problems. When it says X is before Y it means IMMEDIATELY before. I'm not sure why no-one noticed.
Yeah, I think 120 is a good width. However, usually I don't hit that in python. It'd be hard in a verbose langauge. When I was younger I thought shorter code was better or quicker to read. I've found out that not to be true. Here's a bad example, but look at readability (edit: somewhat-tangental , when are more lines good?) if all([ user.not_anonymous, user.company in WHITELISTED_COMPANIES, not user.active_employee, ]): print("Enter, sir") . if user.not_anonymous and user.company in WHITELISTED_COMPANIES and not user.active_employee]): print("Get off my lawn!") I can grok the first snippet better even though it takes more lines. Also, you immediately know it's a combined AND statement, or when it's a combined OR statement, etc
True, I wanted to get the opinion of people who use Python and see if there were certain styles that were good in certain situations or if there's a general consensus that one style trumps all.
The line length limit is trying to tell you to put this into configuration.
Probably looking at the bigger frameworks that have evolved. Twisted &amp; Tornado are probably the two biggest general networking libraries. Then there is HTTP-specialised frameworks like Django &amp; Flask. Then there are asyncio-based frameworks, which are all based on the model of doing concurrency via co-routines &amp; event loops, rather than traditional thread or process based concurrency. Gevent probably was the first popular coroutine library (Twisted could sort of do it), then asyncio was added into standard python 3.4 and things exploded around it. You have aiolib, and "alternate framework" models building around/ontop of it, like Trio &amp; Curio. The key thing about asyncio is that as long as one library is designed to play nice with it, then you should also be able to integrate a different library that also plays nice with it in the same code base, even if the two libraries know nothing about eachother. This is different from previously, when say, both libraries you used would have to choose to rely on Twisted's functionality in order to interoperate.
I ignore line length rules and code so it makes sense visually and logically.
The limit should be statistical rather than a hard limit on all lines. For example, 95% &lt;= 80, 98% &lt;= 120, 99.9% &lt; 160 I have no justification for those numbers. But, my point is most lines should be 80 columns, especially since python is so friendly to breaking things across multiple lines. I have much more sympathy for our javascript brethren and their deeply nested callbacks, promises and whatnot.
Agreed! A great benefit I have is that I am a student so I get access to the Ultimate version of their products for free!
Something nested that far in is a bad code smell...
This.
Yes, this.
This argument can be solved. Set line length to 120, and open your terminals vertically instead of side by side. Everyone wins!!
Using more than 3 indents means your code needs reformatting.
Anyone who argues to enforce 80 char limit should have to use old crt monitors dragged out of the trash bin.
I'll admit I always adjust my pylint to something like 140 characters.
What kind of resolutions/font-size are you all running at? I can easily 120 side by side on a 1080p screen, and on my laptop which is slightly smaller I can still fit two 100 character pages.
It is not too nested, just something like body of `if` in loop inside method.
If there's any way of finding which packages list `pyparsing` as a dependency, that could probably catch a whole bunch of more obscure options!
[pastebin.com](https://pastebin.com) and [hastebin.com](https://hastebin.com) are here to help.
Thank you!
Thank you :) This will definitely help me.
I'm a Python noob. I like assigning function calls to variables for readability/scanability. Is there any downside to doing this?
Four levels of indent sounds like a lot until you realize two of them are a class and method body. class Example: def method(...): while True: if at_end: break def method(...): for page_no in ...: for item in get_page(page_no): ... def method(...): def nested_method(...): if ...: ... Those combined with comments at the end of the line can easily hit 80 characters.
Hard and fast rules should never make the code ugly or unreadable, that is not pythonic. switched linting rules to 120. That seems very viable in the modern era.
Soft wrapping code is iffy, because most soft wrapping I've used doesn't obey continuation indents. Also, if you soft-wrap at 80 in a codebase that hard wraps at something larger than 80, you're going to have a bad time.
Soft-wrapping Python code in sublime text works amazingly well for me 🤷🏼‍♂️
Was this a BS post? Seriously. Zero help from anyone else and you didn’t bother to say “thanks,” or give a crap. Dude: I hope you find your inner peace.
Mobile phones.
I usually code on my laptop so i think the limit fits very well with 2 windows on the screen. Also with 80 lines you can read code clearly, and you have to code in a clearly way, optimize your logic (I think its good!). Maybe this rule could be broken in java, when every method hasAReallyLongNameeeeeeee().
You could do this in vim, I'm on mobile so I don't have an example for you, but you can do it.
TIL everyone in /r/python writes their code on a graphing calculator sized screen
Valid point, although there doubly nested for loops and doubly nested function defs are also bad code smells. I still feel like 80 chars is plenty and if there's big comments at the end of the line, then the methods or variables aren't being named well. On top of these reasons, the primary reason I prefer 80 chars is to fit several split panes onto one screen and also in case of remote debugging.
&gt; And also (maybe more importantly) from a semantic standpoint I very much prefer shorter lines because it tends to make people write more explicit, less nested code. This is what guido said too. Shame on OP
I've used redis backed celery task queues to do ETL stuff.. quick and dirty.
yeah, don't automate things that don't want to be automated. :D You need to adjust the flags selenium server is using to launch chrome. Certain features are used by recaptcha to identify automated browsers.
No, python has first-class functions so if you have an unwieldy function name from a library you can give it a nice name for readability within a code block: is_down = base.mouseWatcherNode.is_button_down escape = core.KeyboardButton.escape() if is_down(escape): pass # blah
I automate everything I can at work - and more work keeps coming. Some automated tasks are: - ingesting music from record labels, logging and processing the releases, emailing our music programmers and sending the files to our backup system. - checking the status of all of our domains to ensure they aren't within 90 days of expiring (this runs on Wednesdays) - checking for stale lock-files and clearing them automatically so processes can continue running on their own. I always email myself when something is found so I am aware of it. - check (hourly) for high email send rates or from multiple IPs from our employees to ensure nobody's email has been hijacked (which has happened) So many more. They might not seem like cool projects but they save me a ton of time every day now that I don't have to do them.
Why isn't "If you don't like the guideline, then ignore it" being presented as an option? PEP8 is a guide of standards, not a hard and fast ruleset. I mean I am by no means a seasoned programmer, but it seems to me that if the interpereter allows lines longer than 80 chars, then it is perfectly valid, if not recommended, to make use of it.
In the past week we've had: 1. Guy (njs) who worked on bringing async to urllib3 (and potentially contributing to requests similarly) writes a [blog post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/bklroc/why_im_not_collaborating_with_kenneth_reitz/ ) accusing Reitz (created requests) of misappropriating donations for async development requests. (Basically taking donation money with no oversight and not doing any dev work for the project people donated for despite being on several committees with proper oversight so he should know how it's done. 2. [Reitz response to blog post](http://journal.kennethreitz.org/entry/conspiracy) (stating njs was weird, we're not using his work as it would be a "bad choice for us", mentioned "Until recently, when Tom Christie joined the team, I was the only person available to work on the advancement of requests." 3. Tom Christie states above he's not going to be involved in requests3 "without major changes to how their project is managed".
But what did it cost to exit?
Actually thats the best. I love that.
Dude, more than 3 indents does *not* mean I have a loop in a method in a class. That's an *if statement* in a method in a class.
Assuming that this isn't sarcasm, I feel like that is a convenience that shouldn't be the driving force behind that standard. 80 character limits are sort of a legacy holdover from the Fortran 77 days.
I was just making a little joke. I actually think 4 indents is fine, but no more.
sir, i almost died of laughing
You review pull requests on your phone?
The usual B/S is that people can conveniently read a bit more than 60 characters per line. What the repeaters forget to realize: that is about prose in books. Prose in books is not indented 8 characters at the first if.
Yes, I do.
THANKS a lot. it worked. Again thanks
thats really pretty looking, would you mind sharing the source?
Then you can't compare lines though
I adhere to the 80-column limit, yet use variable names like `file` without a problem.
That’s a function of text size and distance to monitor, *not* strictly the number of characters in a line. At 80pt, even an 80char line would be insanely wide. So character count really has nothing whatsoever to do with “moving your eyes less” unless we’re all still on fixed terminals and I’m just missing something. Set your font size correctly, and adjust your distance to your monitor. Comfort first, dogmatic programming commandments second.
String literals suck and there needs to be a better way of dealing with them.
... from the source code? No. Don't do that.
Why did my eyes totally skip over that?
60 is totally doable in Haskell. 40 characters is some APL bullshit right there.
as all things should be

It's a great OS... too bad it doesn't have a text editor.
Truth!
Just limit it to 119 and you're fine. 119 is the limit in GitHub before scrollbars are needed
Well the times that aren't part of "most of the times" are really frustrating if you set a hard limit to 80.
No! There are some things that require rooting but none of them should be needed for your task.
Wasn’t my recommendation, I was just letting you know about the performance costs of **decimal**. If the program you’re controlling takes float-like _strings_ of so little precision then you could likely just hand it appropriately rounded strings (ie `"{:.02f}".format(2.0/3.0)` vs `str(2.0/3.0)`), as the resulting string will be practically speaking identical to the results with **decimal**. Of course it’s up to your domain if the precision vs performance aspect of arbitrary precision math is worth it.
Why?
You could do something like this. I like to do if not match continue so it is nested less. import os import re pictures_path = os.path.abspath(os.curdir) regex = ( r'(?P&lt;padded_number&gt;\d{0,2})\s(?P&lt;image_name&gt;.*)\s' r'(?P&lt;image_dimension&gt;\d{0,}\sx\s\d{0,})') for thedir, subfolders, files in os.walk(pictures_path): for file in files: match = re.search(regex, file) if not match: continue dic = match.groupdict() current_path = os.path.join(thedir, file) folder_path = os.path.join( pictures_path, dic.get("image_name"), dic.get("image_dimension")) file_path = os.path.join(folder_path, file) if not os.path.exists(folder_path): os.makedirs(folder_path) os.rename(current_path, file_path)
I will often use "f" as a file handle on its own, inside a very limited scope "with" block. In that very small scoped block, it's obvious what f is. If I'm reading something from the file, then once I've turned it in to something I'm interested in, it's not going to be called something like "data" though, or "d".
Exactly this. Adhering to standards within a team is what matters, not individual preference. We agree to use 120 and black for formatting at work, there is no arguments because we let black make the decision. If it looks bad after black has had it's way with it, you've probably written it badly.
If it's to long for you then you don't code with style

Thanks for the article. I am not a programmer but I write algorithms for living. I can't judge why you (and others cited) defend this to be readable but I am always finding myself scratching my head when things get slightly hairy. I am guilty of all the code smells given in the article (especially [here](https://github.com/ilayn/harold)) but I can't make the transition about how objectifying things help. As you can guess I am not a big OOP fan. To this day they only caused trouble for me and I always ended up adding @staticmethod / @classmethod eventually. I might not be smart enough to design good OO structure. But actually that is a valid reason to stay away from it since with functions I don't need any design. And unfortunately some algorithms are necessarily complicated so I can't see how pushing them into a class would help. Could you elaborate a bit on the initial design phase how I should approach the problem before I touch the keyboard? Maybe I am missing some crucial essentials about this.
While I agree wholeheartedly with your general synopsis, the problem with line length wouldn't be as bad if you used 2-space (as opposed to 4) indentations :)
English English or American English?
&gt;the Ha This is one I read; would recommend it more if new to programming.
Yep, this is one that too often gets missed.
Python is one of the only languages I know where the foundation behind the language has defined a style guide for the language. This guide is just called PEP8. Now the important thing to keep in mind is that it's a _guide_ not gospel. As such, it's not meant to be imposed and followed 100% of the time in every case. _That said_ the guide does define some general naming conventions that from my experience most people do follow. Things like function and class naming and so on. Companies like Google will take PEP8 and offer their modified version, basically "house rules." These are other options/opinions you can look at but keep in mind that this is what Google wants for _their_ employees so that they have a standard. Anyway, the answer is read through PEP8 or download a cheat sheet of the important points. And then instead of wasting time formatting and making sure things are stylistically correct, just use a package like autopep8 (I think it's what it's called) or black to do it for you. Life is short and you have way more important things to do and worry about than adjusting spacing or whatever.
2 Things, Pep8 , import this,
Something about 79-88 is perfect. Feel like you have a lot of free screen space? I use 79 or 88 (in projects being formatted with black) and I've recently upgraded from a full HD display to a UHD one. And I still don't have much free space. In any ide I use I always setup a layout with several vertical windows aka columns. This gives each columns the whole vertical screen space to utilize and allows to utilize horizontal screen space for a number of columns, usually three or even four. As for now, I use vscode. It can show the integrated terminal window to the right of the screen. And this basically it. Just do it in vscode and you won't feel like there is a lot of free space on your screen at all even on a UHD screen and 88 characters in a line code.
Look up the pyscreenshot library, I believe that's what you're looking for :)
the problem is that you need indents in python which are 4 spaces each, so you easily get down to below 70 characters that are not indenting your code. i prefer \`black\` with 120 characters.
Put it in a config file.
Most of the Wikipedia entries for the individual design patterns include Python examples. See also the [python-patterns](https://github.com/faif/python-patterns) GitHub repository for more source code examples.
Try to automate something you do, eg. File renaming, copying, csv manipulation. Play around with packages that make things easier for you
You waste _more_ screen space with long lines, because very short lines (`else:`) are quite common.
I have a huge monitor - I prefer 80 columns. It simply wastes less space.
I'd argue that allowing long lines wastes space. You can wrap long lines to make your screen denser. If you don't, a few long lines will cause a column on your screen to be mostly empty. By forcing 80 character line lengths, you can use that column for something else.
Because you don’t know how to quit it, right?
&gt; Don't be dogmatic. That works for a solo developer in an informal projet. Most people use continuous integration with style checking, and flake8 complains by default if your line is over 79 characters. So you can't just put in a few exceptions - you have to decide to either remove that rule, or explicitly change the max column width, and then put in a commit to do so which affects everyone on the team. When I first started using CI, I had all sorts of checks that I skipped, particularly for flake8. Fast forward a couple of years and all my code now runs with a vanilla flake8. I decided that it was much better for my code to be as conformant as possible, because it's the easiest for everyone to read and passes everyone's tests or lints. "Impress people with substance, not style."
Like very many programmers, my eyesight isn't great. You are making my life considerably harder _and_ you are wasting my screen real-estate - because almost certainly 90% of your lines are less than 80 columns anyway, so those last 40 columns will be 95% whitespace.
Sucks for me if I have to work with you, though.
:-o Generally, I don't care about styles, but please remember any Python program has a lot of short lines like `else:`. If you have 160 columns, you are adding 100% to the real-estate you need to display the same number of lines, while likely only getting about 10-20% more information on the screen. If I wanted to profligately waste real estate, I could just put whiteout all over my screen and get the same effect! :-D
I mean, sry?

Ah, I mixed up 800x600 and 640x480. Thank you.
How did you get the FFmpeg progress/processing speed? It would make my script a lot more usable?
1. /r/learnpython 2. Join will send messages from your phone, at your normal rate. It's probably cheaper to use [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/) or a similar service.
You can use [pypuppeteer](https://github.com/pypuppeteer/pypuppeteer)
Use comments... Frees you up from the burdon to play code golf and gives you enough space to describe your test case sufficiently.
So much this... Tiling is key.
Nah, descriptive test method names are better. If you have a failing test in a test runner, you'll always see the test method name. You might not see the comments.
Try looking in Fluent Python or Effective Python.
Because the world needed this: &amp;#x200B; [The Legend](https://imgur.com/a/9Z9JosP)
You should use Locust or Jmeter. This kind professional testing tools.
Another code smell is object oriented in python. Just don't do that.
I think they are referencing reviews on github as an example. Github limits the size to 1024 regardless of your resolution. &amp;#x200B; I agree that 120 would still most likely fit, but i believe that's the spirit of the original comment.
True dat... don't downvote as it's true. It's how it's pronounced in case you're new. I made the same joke once and got the same downvote so guess it's to be expected.
&gt; doubly nested for loops and doubly nested function defs are also bad code smells. Nested for loops are necessary for unpacking nested iterators, e.g. paginated ones. Python has no flat-map that I'm aware of to hide that for you. Nested functions are very useful when using higher-order functions, especially using them to close over local variables in the parent function. &gt; if there's big comments at the end of the line, then the methods or variables aren't being named well. Comments like "this technially violates the class's invariants but it's okay because we fix everything before anyone else can observe the changes" or "make 5 requests in parallel because 10 or more causes the server to respond with errors" can't be made into variable names. &gt; On top of these reasons, the primary reason I prefer 80 chars is to fit several split panes onto one screen and also in case of remote debugging. Split-screen seems like the one argument for 80 columns that holds water in the present. I'm not convinced that sacrificing half or more of the fullscreen viewers' monitors is a better trade-off than improving soft wrapping and using it to flex to any width, not just 80/120.
The following function's parameter `kommando` is a tuple of arguments as you would give it to a subprocess. It processes Ffmpeg's output lines and builds the progress bar as a string. When printed with `end="\r", flush=True` the last line is overwritten (no new line). The runtime of the movie must be known. Here it is `job.duration_movie`. import subprocess import datetime as dt def ffstart(kommando): """ Execute ffmpeg command. Shows speed, progress, ETA :param kommando: tuple of strings Command line arguments :return: """ def str2td(timestr): """ Convert string to timedelta. :param timestr: str In Format HH:MM:SS :return: datetime.timedelta """ h = int(timestr[0:2]) m = int(timestr[3:5]) s = int(timestr[6:]) return dt.timedelta(hours=h, minutes=m, seconds=s) print(" Speed |% | | | | |50 | | | | |100 ETA") print("Starting...", end="\r", flush=True) timeend = str2td(job.duration_movie) with subprocess.Popen( kommando, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.STDOUT, universal_newlines=True, bufsize=1 ) as p: for line in p.stdout: if line.startswith("frame"): timeindex = line.find("time=") time1str = line[(timeindex+5):(timeindex+13)] time1 = str2td(time1str) speedstr = line[line.find("speed=")+6:line.rfind("x")] progress = int(time1.seconds / timeend.seconds * 50) + 1 progstr = "#"*progress + "-"*(51-progress) rz = (timeend - time1) / float(speedstr) eta = (dt.datetime.now() + rz).strftime('%H:%M') print("{0:&gt;6.2f} {1:&lt;57}{2}".format(float(speedstr), progstr, eta), end="\r", flush=True) print("\n") The output looks something like this: Speed |% | | | | |50 | | | | |100 ETA 1.85 ###########--------------------------------------- 20:30 Each # equals 2% ETA is not the remaining time but actually half past Eight PM. &amp;#x200B; Hope this helps with your script!
I have literally never seen a library on PyPI that doesn't declare any classes. The only projects I've ever written entirely without classes were 15-minute scripts that just used Python as a calculator or a shell. What domain are you using Python in where you can avoid object-orientation, and why do you?
You read the /r/learnpython sidebar and didn't post there because you couldn't post an image of your code. But you didn't read the sidebar **here** that says questions like the one you asked shouldn't be asked here, but should be asked in /r/learnpython. If you read further in the /r/learnpython sidebar you would find it tells you how to post code as text rather than an image.

The missing parenthesis isn't the only thing wrong there. Pay attention to your editor/IDE: It's telling you stuff. The 'elif' clause of your conditional is a different color: can you see why? It's right in front of you ;) Free advice: the internet is here to help, but we're unlikely to do your homework for you. Learn to read code, especially your own. As hard as it might seem, it is important that you learn to recognize these simple typographic errors on sight. Otherwise, when the truly tough problems arise, you will not be able to see the forest for the trees.
Perfect.
I write a lot of golang where it has an auto formatter, but no line length constraints. Shit is hell with vertical splits. Wrapping isn’t a solution as comparisons suffer when splits aren’t the same. Anyway, it took me a while, but 80 is love
No, it's not literal colors. But sublime text has configurable gutters and I've set them up at 79, 99, and 119.
I have sublimetext set up with 3 gutters.
Fitting two 80-column pages side by side is also one of the stated reasons for the choice in PEP8.
 number_to_add = int(inp('enter a string')) if number_to_add: other_number_to_add = int(inp('Enter other string')) if number_to_add and other_number_to_add: if not number_to_add == other_number_to_add: number_to_add == other_number_to_add if number_to_add == other_number_to_add: fourth_number = number_to_add * other_number_to_add if not fourth_number == number_to_add: print('these numbers added is %s' % fourth_number) Yeah the 80 line convention totally forces you to write clean logical and efficient code
It's Todd's sales pitch, I'm sure he's OK with it.
I like seeing more than one line at a time
You lose 20 characters just from normal stuff! Define a class, define a method, start a for loop, enter an if statement. If your logic is at all slightly complex or your names are longer than a few characters (which they should be), the space disappears.
I’m in the same boat, things i start i just end up quitting because it turned out to be boring
This is so correct. On my big monitors at work I can fit 3 or 4 files next to each other if I really scrunch. Knowing that I'm seeing the whole of it without having to horizontally scroll is so freaking nice. People who complain about the width are either lazy or write terrible code.
Yeah I did notice that elif is highlighted but it seemed fine to me and when I ran it the code worked.
Cool. 🤯, Thanks for the idea, i see that Atom has plug ins too. Well there’s a line at 79, I violate it from time to time, but I’m glad it’s there. I’ll play with settings later today.
Because it's convenient
yup agreeded
Then, by all means, exceed the limit ;)
Qt and PySide for desktop applications. But truthfully, web UIs are so good now it's almost worth it to use just use a web framework and make the GUI in browser.

Your best bet is to use wordpress for that. I guess if you wanted to build a web app though django would be better suited but you are still going to need to code html, css, javascript, and probably php.

I had a feeling that this was the case. I read that youtube was written in Python alone although I may be mistaken, although that is not an eCommerce site. I will look into those languages as well!
I've 3 projects using python. Feel free to post new issues and send pull requests. If you need logical help, feel free to post in issues: Small youtube downloader script: https://github.com/ProHackTech/PyTubeDown Script to download rates etc.. from crypto currency exchange sites: https://github.com/ProHackTech/cryptoWatch Windows Anti-Malware app which is using Python for some tasks such as creating a system file list for further scanning etc.. I wish to make a full scanning version in python as well and it's a work in progress: https://github.com/ProHackTech/Prohack-Security-Lite (Add any script to the *testing* branch and dont worry if it doesnt work properly because its testing branch..)
excellent! this is ideal. I think I need to learn more about the structure of ecommerce sites before I start on it, but I'll definitely keep this in mind.
Hello, I got interested about cellular automata and Conway’s Game of Life, so I implemented a small tool to easily simulate one. I tried to make the API intuitive: just define the board, add the lifeforms, and run the simulation. Right now the library has a variety of lifeforms and I’m planning to add more in the future! Hope you enjoy it!
&gt; 80 is fine if you're a fan of single character variable names and short function names, I definitely *do not* use single character variable names - in fact I've often had people comment on how well I word my variables and readable my code is. And I *love* the 80 character limit. It's the perfect length.
This comment is to the person who wrote "WUT" and then deleted the comment. What do you mean WUT? Wordpress makes up over 30% of the web. It is a professional framework that allows anyone to have a professional looking website up and running pretty quick. It has a huge load of add ons available for everything you need for an ecommerce site and everything is constantly patched and updated so security is generally pretty good... why reinvent the wheel? And why would Wordpress make up 30+% of the web if it wasn't an excellent solution?
I'm enjoying messing around with some algorithmic trading on quantopian for fun. Its essentially gambling with python but you learn a bit about trading Heres a starting point. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlV_QO5B2eU
Are you writing entire sentences and calling it a variable name or function name? 80 is plenty long if you use meaningful, verbose names.
What does the "**(abs(answer - computer) &gt; 1)" is it like times it if the distance from zero is greater than 1?
I absolutely don't want to discourage you, and you should definitely learn and grow and create great projects, but I have to agree that WordPress or another existing platform would be best. Django makes it pretty easy to accomplish what you want, but there's so much more to an ecommerce site than just the website logic itself. Now you're talking payments and credit card processing, so if you do that yourself, then you need to get involved with pci dss and prove network security through regular auditing. Or, you can use a payment provider like PayPal or Moneris, when I was doing this we used Moneris' APIs to shift the pci dss requirement to their side. However, you're still dealing with private information, even if you don't touch a credit card, so privacy and security need to be a top priority
Please read the rules, this should be posted to /r/learnpython and your code formatted for Reddit using the guidelines in their rules.

Django or Flask are your best bets for doing this in Python. Hosting is simple, anything will work: AWS, Digital Ocean, Azure, or GCP.
Why have three vim instances rather than one?
That is a shitty unit test name
That's a subjective question if ever there was one...
The same as that for Two.
I am sure I have seen a plug-in that let you configure ruler colours. Even if not, you can add custom CSS very easily if you really want to implement it. Great idea.
That's down to personal preference... a lot of people would say PyCharm and I would agree the features are by far the best... it's just irritating how it can lag sometimes. An excellent text editor that can be made into a full python ide is Sublime 3.
It's subjective. My favorite is PyCharm, but a lot of people also like VSCode. I've not used any others to have an opinion.
TBH, that seems damned unlikely. Every conditional clause in python must be terminated by a ':' character. If it does happen to run as-is, it will fail should the logic ever dictate that the elif: branch execute.
I wrote and deleted that comment. Written because another language was suggested to get grasp on it for a very beginner in Python, and the main reasoning for that is exactly the same as in this comment of yours: user base. No other reasoning at all, and the sub is named r/Python. Deleted as I don't want to be involved in a debate on this. Python is the best option for a ecommerce site whensomeone reads the op.
Maybe use IFTTT? Instead of clicking any script it just uses GPS or wifi to know you left the office?

Yeah I review prs on punch cards so the 80 character limit is relavant to me too.
I have a python based file downloader that supports resuming and multiple threads https://github.com/Hydrophobefireman/downloader-py
For the python part I'm missing a virtualenv for the project. You could have used Flask plugins like flask\_sqlalchemy and flask\_restful et al., instead of rolling your own.
Technology should solve this problem something like autopep8 should be built-in to editors. Think of this like Markdown, the original format is readable but the viewport enriches.

I used to think like this and get where you're coming from, but it really really helps with context and scope once your projects get big, plus it lets you reuse code much more cleanly
I dig this for more granularity than a decorator can provide. Might end up using something similar
Not exactly. If you exponentiate(\*\*) a number with 1, it stays the same. If you exponentiate it with 0, the number becomes a 1. In python and most or all other languages True always equals to 1 and False to 0. So if the absolute of (answer - computer) &gt; 1 is true, i want to divide the result of (answer - computer) by -2. If it's 1 or less, i want to stay it like it is, and thus divide it by 1. So (-2)\*\*1 == -2 and (-2)\*\*0 == 1. The reason for this is that i made a table in excel to check when someone wins or loses. Left Column is the player, top row is the computer: ||Rock (1)|Paper (2)|Scissors (3)| |:-|:-|:-|:-| |Rock (1)|0|\-1|1| |Paper (2)|1|0|\-1| |Scissors (3)|\-1|1|0| &amp;#x200B; Then i tried to find a formula, which gives me the same values. The closest one is (answer - computer), which gives me this table: ||Rock (1)|Paper (2)|Scissors (3)| |:-|:-|:-|:-| |Rock (1)|0|\-1|\-2| |Paper (2)|1|0|\-1| |Scissors (3)|2|1|0| &amp;#x200B; So the only values that are wrong are Scissors vs Rock with 2 and Rock vs. Scissors with -2. To get those right, you just have to divide them with -2, so 2 becomes -1 and -2 becomes 1. To achieve this, i made a mathematical "if the absolute of the value &gt; 2, then divide it by -2, else divide it by 1, so it stays as it is". Now you have a 1 if the player wins, 0 for a draw and -1 if the computer wins with a small one line-formula.
eclipse pydev - is not that bad... if you do not need to set up your environment projekt specifically take a look at vs code looks and nice feels fast... never used pycharm, to expensive just for fun
Minor but [`time.monotonic`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html) should be used instead of `.time()` for timing purposes to prevent system clock updates from skewing the results.
I were using PyCharm and realized that most of times I didn't need nothing more than a terminal and a place just to edit the my py file. So for now im using sublime-text and a terminal together. I prefer using just the necessaire stuff. Try both, they are awesome!

You can also break lines
And yet most of these posts talk about using multiple shells/terminals on the same screen which completely negates that benefit. Fuck, doing anything else on your gigantic 30" monitor is probably screwing with that regardless of your line limit. It's not like anyone looks at code and reads it left to right top to bottom straight through. There's always some amount of cross referencing or doubling back.
on a 1080p with a font size of 16 the 80 characters per line are wonderfull
A day well spent.
Everything.
That’s why you integrate your linters with CI/CD. That way it won’t even build if someone starts to get messy.
132 is the modern Fortran standard (although some compilers don't enforce it). I think 120-132 is sensible - you don't really want too much wrapping going on
There's never a reason to have my code full screen.
&gt; Reading data from a remote location without the request or payload being intercepted and read or modified in transit. Have you considered HTTPS?
No I have not yet such library yet.
yes, but i would like to have a extra layer of security. Perhaps pickle the keys before sending.. hmmm
I'm a 120 fan myself, but you have some redundant checks in there that make 80 look worse than it should, like repeating `if number_to_add` inside of `if number_to_add and other_number_to_add` and checking `if number_to_add == other_number_to_add` after assigning them to be equal anyway (assuming the `==` in the line above it was a typo for `=`). Cleaning that up and using guards instead of nesting makes it look better and still easily fit 80 characters: number_to_add = int(inp('enter a string')) if not number_to_add: return other_number_to_add = int(inp('Enter other string')) if not other_number_to_add or number_to_add == other_number_to_add: return number_to_add = other_number_to_add fourth_number = number_to_add * other_number_to_add if fourth_number != number_to_add: print('these numbers added is %s' % fourth_number)

Pickle isn't security. Don't try to invent security without _significantly_ more experience; you'll probably weaken the existing layers more than you'll improve the overall system. If the threats against HTTPS are real (a mitm impersonating the server with a forged but trusted certificate) then monitor the certificate transparency feed or enforce certificate pinning.

I was just curious if you were doing them outside the office :)
This was a god send, thank you!
The funny thing is that I don't go to office. We work on Slack and Github.
I would assume that limit would depend on screen size, but maybe you're extrapolating that number from some statistical average screen size I don't know about. Or GitHub is consistent between devices.
Ah! Then I understand :)

80 chars is great for side-by-side diffs! If I had my druthers, though, spaced tabs would be 2 spaces, not 4. Fight me.
There are compilers that enforce a line length limit?
120 is a pleasant compromise. In most monitors you can split the screen fine or use tool windows in your editer.
It’s your preference, but I enjoy Pycharm as it works for complex and simple tasks
Traditional Fortran had to fit on a punch card - 80 characters. It's funny though that this got mocked a lot, and then it ended up as recommended for Python anyway
&gt;80 character limit PEP8 dictates 79 characters.
It absolutely is not. If your test names are not descriptive then you are doing it wrong.
I set mine to like 160.
I have a huge monitor too, but I still prefer more than 80 columns. As for wasting less space, you leave more empty space even with side by side windows in 4K. I feel like that's wasting space, not wasting less.
One of the best parts about switching to Black (https://github.com/python/black) has been never talking about this since. Enable it in your editor, have pre-commit.com check it, and focus on things which matter more.

I see your point. But I have to say that: * "X is not an IDE because it can't do everything i need it to" reads as "X is not a right tool for me". Several years ago I had do install a 3rd party plugin into Jetbrains IDEs to enable bash support. The fact that these IDEs didn't support Bash out of the box didn't invalidate the fact that they are IDEs. I also had to install many other plugins to make my IDE work for my workflows. * VSCode with extensions matches your description very closely * I agree that VSCode without extensions is not an IDE (at least not for Python) &amp;#x200B; Few more things. &gt;In addition to integrating with my tooling, it also enhances them by adding features that don't exist and abstracting away the execution so the underlying technology can be swapped out. It could be useful, but I doubt that abstract UI for underlying tools is a necessary attribute of an IDE. &amp;#x200B; &gt;i would have to rely on some third party tool or manually perform them &gt; &gt;also, Microsoft says it's not an IDE There are Microsoft-maintained extensions for Python, C++, Java, Go and other languages, for DB management and other stuff. Jetbrains bundles more stuff (even if you don't need some of it) with their IDEs when Microsoft provides a basic code editor with extension points + a choice from a range of extensions (often maintained by Microsoft) to turn a code editor into an IDE. These are just different approaches to distribution. They have own advantages and disadvantages. &gt;it has lots of cheap and close approximations through plugins, but it is still lacking Extensions I use work very well. They are only few negative things I can mention: * At some point I installed some 3rd party local history/backup extension. It was slowing down code editing. Switched to another extension. * Lack of proper support for remote debugging was the biggest disappointment for me. Hopefully [this](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2019/05/02/remote-development) will change the situation.

I'm going to go against what everyone else is saying and recommend you to use Django instead of Flask for your *first* project.

Don't fall into the rabbit hole of learning everything from the start such as optimizations or how to scale Python apps. &amp;#x200B; To conclude, use Django and actually release your application. Everything else you will learn when you need to learn it.
True, and technically Fortan's line limit started ignoring characters after 72 characters and it was the old Punch cards that were 80 characters wide. My point is that the roughly 80 character limit seems more in line with older legacy formats that are way less relevant today.

Hey thanks for your input! Here’s my thing: this project is really meant to be a learning experience and something that I can throw up on Github to eventually show to potential employers. With that said, would your suggestion remain the same?
You're wrong and you should feel bad: long lines are hard to read, it's why newspapers use columns nested code is bug prone (too many scopes) highly nested code is hard to reason about diffing two wide files is slow and frustrating 80 chars is perfect and it always will be... until the human eye works differently (spoiler alert, it won't).
This is a much bigger can of worms than you think. What you *actually* need is a JavaScript processing engine. Something that returns an object *after* the DOM has finished loading. Splash is a good start, but it uses Lua for scripting.
Ah yes, imposter syndrome, we meet again. Props, though. Every PR I make in GitHub leaves me stressed for the rest of the night thinking that tomorrow will be the day that they find out that I can be replaced with a few dozen StackExchange queries.
Interesting. I always figured 80 was because that was what old videocards/monitors or terminals used.
I wouldn't be so hard on yourself. When you are designing an algorithm, you have all the details in your head, so it makes sense to write those details down exactly as you're imagining them. On top of that, we think of algorithms in terms of input and output. So it makes intuitive sense that there's only one "thing" the input goes into and the output comes out of. We need to divorce the theory of an algorithm from the implementation. At some point, you will modify the algorithm or fix a bug in it. Except it's going to be 6 months to a year later, and it might not be you doing the work. How can you write the code such that it's easy to slip back into an understanding? Abstractions. By that I mean you give a good name to the different parts of your algorithm, and put those parts in their own functions. Slowly, you push the little details down into other methods (input validation, getting a substring) so that you can express your algorithm at a high level. To steal a mantra from Edward Tufte: "overview first, [...], then details on demand". This quote is what data visualizers live by, but it also applies to organizing your code, because code is data, and programmers are the consumers. If I'm writing a bread-first search, I'd like to say something like "visit my neighbors first, and then visit their neighbors". Really high level, right? I didn't say anything about checking for `None`, or a queue. But if you, the programmer wish to know more, you'd look at the function I call for visiting neighbors (details on demand). So, try to express your algorithm in layers. High level first, and procedurally lower level as you delve into functions. A class in this case is an organizing tool meant to keep everything in one place and not exposed to the client. And try to keep each function at the same "level" of abstraction; don't mix low-level details with high level concepts.

Yep my eyesight isn’t great so I use a slightly larger font and still have room for 160 characters per line if I want.
If you want to make apps for Android and/or iOS I recomend using any other language. For Android specifically Kotlin/Java and Android studio. You could use Corona sdk which uses lua and is quite similar to Python. Cheers!
Are you trying to describe a linter? https://www.pylint.org/
But that’s what decreasing your tab width is for. (Yes I know that’s also against PEP)
If the code uses 120-char lines, then a desktop screen will be more convenient?
That's when you use two-space indents :D
Uhm, no, not at all. I mean "what do the CPython core developers use to make sure the language parser functions correctly?"
Yes, my suggestion would absolutely remain the same. There are zero cons for you using Django as your web framework. Django will help you ship faster which will most likely motivate to continue building.
I set my linter to 125.
I eat with a fork and indent with spaces. I am not a fucking uncivilized savage. (jk) If you want to prevent people from writing nested ifs and fors increasing the indentation and hard limit on the right margin is what you really want.

Dunno why you got downvoted, you're right and that name makes no sense
you can use the `width` and `height` keyword args for the output size :)
Or don’t even think about it and let Python format it self: https://github.com/python/black
Excellent, thank you very much for the input!
.egg format is required but I can't convert .X or .obj to that
You’re welcome :)
Thanks
I totally agree with this but then in actuality what happens is that you have a giant class with every small bit is broken down into mini methods (say 20 SLOCs) that is also impossible to follow unless you are using an IDE of some sort so that you can jump around. If you have a simple editor, this class based abstraction is also incredibly difficult to follow without scrolling like you are on fire. So I am trying to get the essence how this many important programmers argue that it is better than writing dedicated and generic functions that can be used by other parts without the class complexity.
I use pycharm most of the time except when I need to edit something quickly on a file, for those situations I just use notepad because Pycharm startup loading takes some minutes.
That moment when you're several indentation levels deep with verbose variable and function names made out of 3-4 words and your IDE starts complaining about PEP8.

/s/s/s guess I forgot to add that
Line 45 you have a open paren on multiply
The actual ideal column width is 40-60 characters. So the 80 standard already takes indention into account.
It's highlighting what it thinks is a named parameter. So it is syntax highlighting after all.
Yeah... I wasn't done defining that functionality... OMG... I'm an idiot... Sublime thinks puzzle3 is a parameter for some function I'm defining.... So when I see this again (in the future), it is likely an indication something is wrong/incomplete with my collective script and syntax. Thank you!
You are correct... I was too confident with my work... Every time I searched for Text highlighting, it always brought up Syntax Highlighting... but I was inaccurately proceeding with the premise that nothing in my code would impact why puzzle3 was changing like that... Thank you for your time and feedback. &amp;#x200B; Just goes to show you need to always re-review your code...

One approach is to look at the [Top PyPI Packages](https://hugovk.github.io/top-pypi-packages/), find interesting projects on GitHub from there, and then search for "good first issue". I'll pitch a project I'm working on! Some possible upsides to contributing to this particular project is that (1) it's pure Python, (2) relatively small with a clear goal, and (3) using the newest versions of Python with no backwards compatibility requirements. The goal is to provide recursive, tree-like documentation in the terminal for arbitrary Python objects. Here's the current output: treedoc list list(iterable) "Built-in mutable sequence." ├── list.append(self, object) │ "Append object to the end of the list." ├── list.clear(self) │ "Remove all items from list." ├── list.copy(self) │ "Return a shallow copy of the list." ├── list.count(self, value) │ "Return number of occurrences of value." ├── list.extend(self, iterable) │ "Extend list by appending elements from the iterable." ├── list.index(self, value, start, stop) │ "Return first index of value." ├── list.insert(self, index, object) │ "Insert object before index." ├── list.pop(self, index) │ "Remove and return item at index (default last)." ├── list.remove(self, value) │ "Remove first occurrence of value." ├── list.reverse(self) │ "Reverse *IN PLACE*." └── list.sort(self, key, reverse) "Stable sort *IN PLACE*."

How many hours did this take you?
AFAIK, `time.perf_counter` is also a thing for this purpose.
That’s the point. The test‘s name is not descriptive.
If you use PyCharm then pep8 fixes are highlighted.
I think I misread the name and when I saw your comment assumed you were one of the guys who doesn’t like long test names. Looking back now, yes, you are right.
Because I let my WM (i3) handle window layout, I have vim yank to the system clipboard so that covered about all the interaction I need between instances for my needs.
How bad is using time.time()? Normally when I'm profiling code I only care about time on the scale of 10+ seconds, is it inaccurate at that level?
It requires Python 2.7 but mine is 3.6. or few versions can be installed at the same time?
Don't put an English title if you speak Arabic all the way through it.
Just stumbled across this reply and wanted to say a big THANK YOU for your book. It has really got me into coding like no other book ever has.
I wouldn't install Py2 alongside Py3, I wouldn't install Py2 regardless (but that's besides the point). I've never played with pandas3D, however the code of obj2egg doesn't seem to be that difficult to port to Py3. At the very least, it gives you some idea on what to do to make a .obj file work.
very nicely architected!
I think you are right. Thanks a lot!
Cool! Thanks! I'm kinda new to all python environment so it takes me some time to setup everything. But it's really cool to see the final animation of the simulation :)
My job uses pep8, and we go through code review for every merge request. I got a comment on it saying I hadn't used the full 80 characters for a comment in my code, and I broke it too early.
Possibly I'm misunderstanding, but it sounds like it would only have major impact for daylight savings changes and leap days for example. But I could be mistaken
Naw that couldn't be it, time.time() uses a standardized epoch (time elapsed since an arbitrary date) so daylights savings wouldn't effect it. For example I just tried it and the output was 1557606679.7283316
That's a legitimate concern and I think can absolutely happen. However, my personal experience is that it's not bad at all. There ends up being just a handful of methods per class, and with the single entry point it's not so bad if you order them in terms of ``` entry_point() first_helper() second_helper() etc() ``` An IDE certainly helps with going to the function you're looking at, but even a basic editor like VIM has a way to jump to text under the cursor. So again, definitely possible, but I recommend you try it for yourself first to see what you think. If the proliferation of methods becomes too much, you might actually have another class lurking about.
Cool. Looking for bugs now.
I also like the 80 character limit. Then the code fits nicely within a default terminal window assuming you're using a command line text editor. I rarely use the full screen for one code buffer in my editor (unless the code is not up to PEP8). I tend to have at least two windows side by side, sometimes even three depending on the screen I'm using. I like the 80 character limit because well written and standardized code accommodates these window configurations well.
I'd guess about tree fitty

The effect your looking for is "coverflow" - there seem to be a few open source python projects on GitHub using it that could be a good starting point
Oh cool, I didn't realize they were constructing the parser from a specification! That would explain why they didn't need tests for that part. When writing macros in rust you usually want to make sure that all the ways you expect the macro to be used work correctly, so i assumed python does the same. &amp;#x200B; Anyways, i found the third link you sent a few hours ago, and ended up building my solution based on that. I implemented all of the syntax, excluding the \`async for\` which is not currently supported in rust, including consecutive \`if\` clauses, PLUS \`if let\` clauses which are a special rust construct similar to \`if\` statements. Unfortunately though, I couldn't get rid of the need for the pesky semicolons without the macro becoming an unmaintainable mess... &amp;#x200B; I literally released the version with all those extra implementation nuances a few minutes before you commented, so you can see what i ended up with here: [https://crates.io/crates/py-comp](https://crates.io/crates/py-comp) &amp;#x200B; thanks for helping though! :D
It's all very pythonic and exceedingly clean, well done! My only criticism is your update step using scipy convolve. It's a little *too* clever IMO, and not sure whether it's worth the added dependency. I remember seeing it once before on jakevdp's blog and thinking the same thing (though his blog is educational so it's a good place to learn new tricks). But that's largely a matter of taste

Best of luck 👍 Python is a great language to learn. I also suggest learning Java or C#. They're fun and pretty easy to learn.

Cool article, I'm all for learning how to use web scrapers and automate useful things like finding cheap flights, however there are comparison or flight searching sites that have simple to learn URL query parameters/filters for which you can use requests, e.g., check out Skyscanner.de. This would accomplish the task in a much more reliable and quicker fashion then a webscraper. Nonetheless, for learning webscraping this is a good article.
Welcome to Python A good way to get help is break down what you are doing and not make assumptions, so which operating system, what version of python, what steps are you taking to get to the point of the error? Also from the sidebar: &gt; If you are about to ask a "how do I do this in python" question, please try r/learnpython
/r/learnpython and read the sidebar The shell only stays open until your script finishes executing.

This kind of post should be post there - &gt; r/learnpython. Also its seems like somewhere in your code you try to convert a string of character to int as the error mentioned. Unfortunately, in the code you given seems not be related with the error.

Thanks a lot. As a beginner of python is this bundle worth it or are the books presented outdated?
Can you tell me where did u find it? I have Spyder 3.3.4, installed using pip, because I have miniconda :)
Are you certain that you want to use PipENV? it appears to have some problems

I've only read three listed in this bundle: - Fluent Python by Luciano Ramalho - Test-Driven Development with Python by Harry Percival - Flask Web Development by Miguel Grinberg Each of these are excellent resources; their respective authors are talented, well-established members of the community. Most practices taught are timeless. I recommend them highly. The others I cannot comment as I haven't personally reviewed them.
Afaik skyscanner doesn't have the feature to check flexible dates in fact i was looking for something to give me the cheapest in a range of date but only found Hopper so i have to use both, but now that could be automated.
On the contrary, I understand exactly how it works, and that's why I say it's bad. It's a half assed implementation of object orientation. You want to do OO? Use C++, Java if you must, but for the love of binary, don't use python.
Thank you very much for the feedback. Just did a little additional googling and found out that the old humble python bundles weren't apparently that good, but this one is a quality one. So I just got it.
Absolutely. I’m a comp sci major with a 2015 MacBook Air and have had zero problems coding in python as well as every other language.
Not to mention the beginners out there writing loops and hitting sites every 20ms
Why not?
People used to learn to program by writing on notebook paper. I think you'll be OK.
Use [PySimpleGUI](http://www.PySimpleGUI.org) and you can get any kind of GUI you want. Even run it from a browser without changing the code. Sit down and draw out your GUI design on paper, then code up the Windows.
Any tips on what softwares to download on a macbook for learning Python?
The software will be the same as any windows or Linux system, an ide or text editor and python itself. In terms of ides id reccomend VSCode as it's the most popular at the moment dispite being a mix of a text editor and an ide
I believe the issue is that you are using windows. Switch to linux, and you may find everything runs better.
If you're looking for a full-featured IDE / code editor, I highly recommend [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/). It's great for beginners and experts alike.
Good on you. Welcome and enjoy your Python journey.

I have not taken the compiler course, but have taken three of his other courses, the Python intro, mastery, and projects courses. I felt all were excellent courses, and spending the week in Andersonville with David was quite a treat. The compiler would be the next class I would take, if I were to go again, although the Computer Science: The Good Parts interests me, too. I don't have an interest in compilers as topic, but understanding the items mentioned in the takeaways would be a good leveling-up. He does keep checking on everyone to keep all moving along about the same pace. I found the intro class to be a good refresher and a dip into a couple of areas not in my previous Python studies. The mastery class was a great addition to the understanding of how Python work behind the scenes. The projects class was a great all around exercise with some pretty interesting projects (like programming a ray tracer in Python from C source code). I was pretty pounded out in the projects class by end of day Thursday. I imagine the compiler class and SICP class would be a step or two of brain twisting above that.
Thanks.

I don't think it's as simple as that. When I code review, there's a sliding scale of what PEP 8 violations I will point out. If the lines are slightly too long, 9 times out of 10 I'd let that slide. However, naming classes using snake_case rather than UpperCamelCase? I'd point that out every time because that shit is egregious.
I use PyCharm if I'm working on a project. I also love the Flask and Django integration. When I'm tinkering or just trying something quick I tend to use a combination of sublime and Ipython. I always say try every one you come across and see what fits you the best. Everyone is different and that's cool.
Start pycharm as an administrator. Maybe this will help. It looks like it has no access to this file/folder.

&gt;Thanks for the reply. I don't know exactly what ai taxi is... I searched it up and a mini game popped up that finds the shortest distance between two points. Is that it? Could you explain more plz?
The irony here is your username is snake_case. Jokes aside, I wholeheartedly agree that some features of pep8 are more important than others. My general approach is that if I have to break one of the rules, I have to have a reasonable reason for it.
In Ableton its easy. In Python I have no idea. But if you can do it manually, quantizing the audio wave into many parts and stretching each part by looping it e.g. 3 times could maybe do the job. Look up how the algorithm works and try to emulate it. Ableton has some awesome algorithms.. maybe they are explained somewhere?

When I run your example code (GitHub page) it seems to execute but I only get an output of seagull.simulator:animate:153 Rendering Animation... in the console window. I don't see the animation(I'm running windows) Is there another step?
Hi funkenpedro The animate command returns a matplotlib.FuncAnimation, usually you can do something like this: anim = sim.animate() anim.save(“out.gif”) # save as GIF In a jupyter notebook, afaik you can set something like: % matplotlib qt or matplotlib.pyplot.plt.rcParams[“animation.html”] = “jshtml” To render the animation right away Further info: https://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2012/08/18/matplotlib-animation-tutorial/ https://matplotlib.org/api/animation_api.html I guess I need to update the docs regarding that too! Thanks!
Yes, actually it was jakevdp’s blog where I ~took it from~ got the inspiration from. Yeah I agree, I’ll retro next weekend to see if it’s worth the dependency! Thanks again!
Hello, &amp;#x200B; I wrote a program that draws a rotating square pattern.

[Made a post a few months](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/arek26/i_made_a_gaussian_curve_fitter_using_matplotlib/) ago sharing a very crude graphical curve fitter I made in matplotlib, after getting tired of manually filling in parameter estimates. Since then I've experimented with quite a few different versions [(here's one)](https://i.imgur.com/JJOqQfe.gif) [(and another)](https://i.imgur.com/87fppzk.gif) but this one seems to be the most promising yet. I'm not a programmer and have just been doing this to learn and have fun. The first version used the graphical estimates to write a suitable function in a .py file and then imported the file to use that function. I think this is a bit of a strange way to do things and tried to find a better solution. &amp;#x200B; This one is based around some function classes I wrote which basically "wrap" (I could be using this word wrong) python functions inside a class which can store parameters and do a few useful things. These functions have methods to fit the function (find optimal parameters for given data), using currently stored parameters as estimates. They can add together into composite functions with the '+' operator and can be saved and loaded into other programs with help from the dill library. These objects have \_\_call\_\_ methods and can be called like ordinary functions but also can be called without passing parameters, in which case they use the ones they have stored. [Code for anyone interested](https://pastebin.com/SFxEa5B2). Any input on this would be very appreciated, I'm very new to object oriented programming and to python in general and would like to improve. &amp;#x200B; The code for this fitter is a complete mess and very far from complete. It also requires a bunch of module imports specified with exact paths on my computer since I don't really know how to make packages. If people are interested in the code I will try to fix the imports and post all the files. It's pretty much based off of the fast rendered draggable rectangle example in the [matplotlib event handling documentation](https://matplotlib.org/users/event_handling.html). The draggable markers here have a Gaussian instance of the function class mentioned attached to them which can be shown individually or summed together with the other peaks. All of the controls are handled with the mouse and keyboard. \- middle mouse click to add a peak \- left click and drag to adjust mean and amplitude \- scroll wheel to adjust standard deviation (width) \- space to toggle between viewing individual/composite function(s) \- once happy with the estimates press 'a' to attempt a fit to the data You then get a composite function object out with all of the comprising functions with their optimal parameters and errors. This can be saved and loaded into other programs.

I don’t know if a tool exists but my guess is it is pretty easy. Figure the lowest frequency to support is 20 Hz so you can chop you samples into 20 time blocks. The just cut out the right number to speed it up. You may want to do some filtering to ensure a continuous signal or that may not matter. Maybe just Apple a low-pass filter afterwards to remove the jumps (discontinuities are very localized in time so very spread out in frequency)

 *Mark Summerfield:* Python in Practice
Usually it's easy to start coding with Python, esp. for non beginners, so official documentation should be enough: [https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html) and [https://docs.python.org/3/reference/index.html](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/index.html) (plus check some popular projects implemented in Python to see how to better organize things, etc).
Go for it
IMHO, looks at it from a coding perspective. Would you have any right to be offended if someone submitted a PR to refactor a section of code and made it more efficient? I would hope not. Same should apply for documentation. They can always reject. But it's their loss.
I also found this hilarious fellow human!
This is pretty cool! Why bother trying to fit a GMM with EM when you can just eyeball it, I guess haha
Try the learning resources in the /r/learnpython sidebar. There is a section specifically on learning python coming from other languages.
Specifically, these resources: [https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/index#wiki\_new\_to\_python.3F](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/index#wiki_new_to_python.3F) Good luck!

If those are actually pythons, the instructor is literally programming them.
They're cobras.
I wouldn’t say it’s huge pain-point but it’s inefficient as we’re all building pretty much the same thing privately. A proper foss repo for e.g. a Django SaaS boilerplate that people can use and contribute to would be interesting imho.
Documentation is probably the most preferred way to begin contributing.
I find that person’s use of the word “thrilling” thrilling.

I have one py2 container around for old fabric deployment scripts. The 2.0 release took far too long, and I've switched to saltstack for deployments which is much more powerful than fabric anyway. For simple tasks I still use CRON, GNU make, and I also use Jenkins for some periodic tasks. Some of the tasks start a container that performs a more complex job.
They have pretty complicated algorithms to change speed without pitch. Its not trivial at all so generally you have quite complex algorithms that do it. Look here to see if you can find references to algorithms that are implemented in Python: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio\_time\_stretching\_and\_pitch\_scaling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_time_stretching_and_pitch_scaling)
**Audio time stretching and pitch scaling** Time stretching is the process of changing the speed or duration of an audio signal without affecting its pitch. Pitch scaling is the opposite: the process of changing the pitch without affecting the speed, not to be confused with the simpler process of pitch shifting which affects both pitch and speed by slowing down or speeding up a recording. These processes are used, for instance, to match the pitches and tempos of two pre-recorded clips for mixing when the clips cannot be reperformed or resampled. They are also used to create effects such as increasing the range of an instrument (like pitch shifting a guitar down an octave). *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Python/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28

Look into AudioTSM module. https://pypi.org/project/audiotsm/ https://github.com/Muges/audiotsm Examples: https://muges.github.io/audiotsm/
I would definitely say go for it. Clearer documentation makes the project easier to access. Also, from a non-native perspective: some people are able to read English but lack a lot of vocabulary. It’s funny that sometimes a sentence you would consider “unnatural” would be easier understood by non natives. My point is, if you do this try to avoid using too unusual words (if it is possible).
That's what I thought at first, but so many people eyeball so many things, curve fitting is both in the margin of error and probably a smaller error source than whatever you're doing with that curve later. Especially with less datapoints that you're not even 100% sure about, like surveys, where exactly you put the curve is highly debatable and probably doesn't influence the conclusion.
Thanks I understand now

As a non-native, I would not feel offended by a contribution that enhance the work I have done, on the contrary! Aside from making the documentation clearer, it's a good way for us to pick up on some new vocabulary and ways of presenting the information that we can reuse afterwards.
Fabric? That's a blast from the past. Nowadays if I want to do remote automation, it's Ansible.
If you are sure that you're correcting something wrong that's perfectly fine and I would be really thankful. The only thing you should be careful about is correcting because you just don't like the style. If it's correct and coherent it's presumptuous to change it. But especially as a non-native speaker I would be grateful.
Yeah, this is what I thought. It's a fun little side project, but if you want automated data analysis there are plenty of far more robust and comprehensive softwares already available.
English is not my native language and I am not the developer of a project. In my opinion, any improvement of a documentation makes sense. Especially because I've realized that many programmers are good at coding but lousy at creating documentation. Or they don't have the time or the desire to create a documentation at all. Especially when it comes to documentation or translations, in my experience most projects are happy when the situation is improved. For example, my last pull request was to change "step 3" to "step 2". I also created pull requests in which I only changed the sentence structure in a documentation, because in my opinion the passage in question was too awkward to read. But the content was correct. With a friendly explanation in the PR this has never been a problem. Of course there are also other cases. I can still remember when I did a complete translation for a certain program. At one point I made a mistake. After a few hours there was an issue report for it. To fix the bug wouldn't have taken me 5 minutes. However, the main developer was so pissed about the bug that I simply didn't contribute anything to the project anymore. In my experience, however, such cases represent a minority.
Or translations. For me, this is usually even easier than a documentation.
The problem is working out who's qualified to do this. If I see code I can work out if it's more efficient or not. If you change "outnumbered 1-100" to "outnumbered 100-1" I can't easily do this. Both are gramatically correct but the second is idiomatic English and the first isn't.

Is there a list of repositories of cool stuff ppl do with matplotlib?
I know nothing at all, but I would just loop through each number in the array and look for a match based on the user input.
Yep, using V2 for AWS orchestration using boto and throposphere, works great.
....my face looks dumb doesn't it
A face of someone I would expect to write python to update latex. 👍
Cool. What is it used for?
We have special deployment system and Fabric plays a big role in it, from service deployments, updates all the way to backups and re-configurations. We are using it together with Vault and Consul to store, update and save secrets.
There are not many good ways to fit a 2-D GMM. When I was doing a similar project I didnt find any. However, you can optimise the height and SD given the mean and provide a good first estimate for the mean (I used local minima of the second derivative)
It's just a multimodal gaussian. Fully automated is a long solved problem. This project is just having fun.

This is awesome. Python needs something like this. I built something similar, but using buttons and sliders. I think the mouse interface is a good one though. Did you program keyboard actions to controller the width of a given feature? See: https://lentner.io/2018/06/14/autogui-for-curve-fitting-in-python.html

A small number of users are having this problem but I can’t replicate it... please follow up on the github issue if you can help us understand what is happening: https://github.com/plotly/plotly_express/issues/23

It’s one of the most basic non-trivial models to fit.
I guess it depends on what your requirements are but this would be a simple start. Take the user input and check it against the list of numbers numbers = \[0,1,2,3,4\] &amp;#x200B; def do\_something(number): print(number) \#do something &amp;#x200B; while True: user\_number = input("Enter one of 0,1,2,3,4: ") if int(user\_number) not in numbers: print(user\_number, "is not in the array") else: do\_something(user\_number)
Why do I find this sexy?
Hey Ron, Informative article. How are other services providing IP to city information?
I'm working on my very first "real" Python project (I did a tiny little thing with classes but it was basically just following a format, it didn't involve much, if any, real thinking). I'm trying to build a program that can be used to determine how many months it would take to buy a house, minus the down payment. So far my noob mistakes have been forgetting "" when asking for user input and being confused when it didn't show up in the output, forgetting to call the input to print and being confused why only the input prompt was printing but not the user input, using a less than sign when I needed a greater than and indenting my while loop print when I shouldn't have, because I only wanted the total number of iterations to print, not each individual one. I think I've got most of the bugs worked out, except my code always prints 75,000 for the number of months. I'm going to try current_savings+=monthly_salary*portion_saved to see if it will fix my code, but if it doesn't I'm kind of at a loss. I can't post my code right now, but you can take a peek into my post history to find a version of it without some of the minor improvements I've made.
I've been coding for around 1.5 years by now and still get a lot of enjoyment from trying out new things. Personally I think it's ok for projects to go unfinished, at least for me it's still good practice at this point and satisfies that urge to try something new. A few projects (small) that I've done for fun are: \- Isometric sprite based game in PyGame (it was a Python-based recreation of an old game I used to love) \- Server-client messaging application \- Android application to wake and control my PC remotely \- Network packet monitoring and VoIP call stitching \- Django based website &amp;#x200B; Many more small things that just pique my interest at some point. As I'm still a newbie some stuff I've struggled to get into but things that really intrigue me and I hope to be able to dive into more in the future are: \- Neural nets \- Antiviruses and security \- Further game development Hope this helps spark some ideas! Good luck
I've heard of some person who created a Python project that could be used to simulate nuclear attacks(or something like that). So maybe something like that(could also be astroids, extreme weather, a certain species going extinct, etc) if you think you could pull it off?
Looks great! How is the documentation locally? With this toolset and the right training materials stored locally, it could be a great beginners OVA.
I've dabbled in a few IDEs but my favourite by far and the only one I use now is Sublime 3. I've tried multiple times to get in PyCharm and I just find it's a bit slow and clunky. For my needs, Sublime does everything I need, though one of the annoying things is that it doesn't accept user input meaning I tend to use IDLE should I need to test inputs
In case you're interested, the [Hyperspy python project](http://hyperspy.org/) works really well for curve fitting all types of spectroscopy data!
Recently posted in another thread, this might help you get started [https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/bnbawq/ive\_hit\_a\_wall/en7sdsv?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/bnbawq/ive_hit_a_wall/en7sdsv?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)
Hi u/jftuga, this is a bit tricky though as this is being handled on country level. Some countries allocate per city, some allocate per telco (which could overlap or could be allocated on multiple cities). Some services collect city information via geolocation but this is not accurate.
Thank you for your opinion. It lacks of local documentation but included Chromium browser has links to: * Anaconda docs * 10 Minutes to pandas * Matplotlib * NumPy quick start
Well with pyautogui, I think you can easily do this, pyautogui is for automating user interactions so it is fairly easy to just feed it a list of links of the website you want to take a screenshot of, then just make a script to visit each site and take a screenshot.
You would do a for loop and then find the .text of each element
Besides, this can of project help you to understand better what are you doing with data and how some parameters affect the fitting (in case you're new in the field and is hard for you visualize in your mind).
You just need to make an http request to their api, I think requests library can do that. But before you make a request you need to get an api key from the api and I think you need to register your device. Also, you need to set up the parameters for your request like the content and other stuff. If you need help feel free to pm.
If you've gone through a lot of the very beginner projects that must mean you know the fundamentals and other stuff like loops, functions, and classes. I suggest you get your own projects or learn a library, cause if you have watched some python tutorials you probably already know most of the stuff you're gonna read from there.
Thanks for reminding me, bump
I'm using it every single hour. I have around 40 tasks created with Fabric for automation, I've been using it since the first time i heard about it. Lovely tool.
I made a script for a client to just divide data into parts and earned a little amount of money. I also made a script for the tweetdeck feature of twitter to schedule tweets to an account and a script to scrape some data off reddit so I can tweet that data to twitter.

Where are you getting your pricing info from, I’ve struggled to find a good source for this.
Typically columns 73-80 were used for card sequence numbers, helpful if you dropped a deck.. just run it through a card sorter. Later the sequence numbers were used for update facilities (think early source control utilities). An update deck would have control statements that would indicate if something should be inserted, replaced, or deleted. The sequence numbers would not start at 1, but around 1000 with an increment of 1000. Then when inserting or replacing lines, you could use smaller values. For example given a 4 line file (putting the sequence numbers first): 00001000 line1 00002000 line2 00003000 line3 00004000 line4 And an update file: ./ I 1000 Insert 1 Insert 2 ./R 3000 4000 Replaced line You would get: 00001000 line1 00001300 Insert 1 00001600 Insert 2 00002000 line2 00003500 replaced line The way the sequence numbers got assigned during the updating would allow a bunch of updates to be applied and ensured that the updates were applied in order.
So Unix/Linux doesn't really use file extensions to determine file type - they are a hint to the user and a holdover from the dark days of 8.3 filename limitations on old filesystems (think DOS). http://www.linfo.org/magic_number.html for more info.
Thanks for the tip!

I'd definitely be interested in the full code listing - the one you posted doesn't actually execute anything, so I'm curious if you have a main module that plots a datafile and then creates your class.
Make each step as a tool that you can run on Terminal and use another language for pipelines like Common Workflow Language, CWL. It’s designed to run a workflow (pipeline) of tools and workflows.
Very interesting, thank you for that! I'm glad that I never had to work with punch cards though.
Yeah as someone else pointed out, there is much better software out there for this kind of thing. Personally I quite like being able to see what what's going on and sometimes there are peaks which you know are there but are not at all obvious, although I'm guessing other people would have thought of that already. The way we were taught to fit curves like this on my course was somewhat long and tedious. It was something like this: `count, energy = np.loadtxt("galsteel-2.5-512.txt", skiprows = 1, unpack=True)` `energycut = energy[72:105]` `countcut = count[72:105]` `plt.plot(energycut, countcut, '.', color='red') #gavlinised steel gain = -2.5, 512 channels` &amp;#x200B; `def gauss(x, A, u, o):` `return A*np.exp(-(((x-u)**2)/(2*(o**2))))` &amp;#x200B; `def gausscomb(x, A, u, o, B, u2, o2):` `return A*np.exp(-(((x-u)**2)/(2*(o**2)))) + B*np.exp(-(((x-u2)**2)/(2*(o2**2))))` &amp;#x200B; `init_guess = np.array([12000, 6.4, 0.3])` `init_guesscomb = np.array([1200, 6.4, 0.3, 2500, 7.05, 0.4])` &amp;#x200B; `popt, pcov = curve_fit(gauss1, energycut , countcut, init_guess)` `popt2, pcov2 = curve_fit(gausscomb, energycut , countcut, init_guesscomb)` &amp;#x200B; `elin = np.linspace(min(energycut), max(energycut), 1000)` `plt.plot(elin, gauss(elin, *popt), linestyle = '--', color='grey')` `plt.plot(elin, gausscomb(elin, *popt2))` &amp;#x200B; Obviously for a lot of peaks it gets tiring fast and it's hard to know what to use as the estimates when peaks are overlapping. I guess they didn't want to tell us about the other ways of doing it because the point was to learn to use scipy to fit to any function ourselves.
In the mainframe world, the use of sequence numbers and the updating facilities are still in use. The editors on mainframes know how to deal with the sequence numbers and will even apply update files automatically as well as create new update files during edit sessions.
I'm sure I've seen requests for correcting or proofreading documentation. I'd get a feel for the project before firing off PRs.
Not yet with this one unfortunately but the other versions I've made have the ability to choose between fitting Gaussian and Lorentzian curves since I came across a fair few Lorentzian datasets as well. You can see in [this](https://i.imgur.com/87fppzk.gif) gif that there is a button to fit lorentzian distributions. It worked pretty well for an assessment I had which involved fitting dozens of acoustic resonant peaks. Pretty glad I didn't have to write out parameter guesses for all of them (as we were taught to do).
How can I make each step as a tool. And this isn’t possible to be done with another python script?
I had the same strut until I found mtgjson.com. They made it really easy!
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7974849/how-can-i-make-one-python-file-run-another For parallel, look into the builtin threading module. To catch errors, use try and except blocks.
interesting, what was the most challenging thing to implement while you worked on this project?
Hey this is pretty cool. Do you mind giving some details on what used and how you made it?
All in all quite a long time. I first got the idea two months ago and since then have probably written and rewritten at least two dozen py files. It's the eternal cycle of: &amp;#x200B; write spaghetti code ---&gt; rewrite it nicely ---&gt; add features ---&gt; spaghetti code again.
TIL.
Love this. Was wondering how you’re learning; are you teaching yourself or using an online resource?
I Used Jupyter notebook. Then I created a 2D list. 0 for a dead cell and a 1 for a alive cell. then, check the list with a nested for loop and update the List based on the rules of the game. Then I printed these images and added them together to a gif
[removed]
Yes, kinda. I started off wanting to code Conways Game of life. To learn I wached many youtube tutorials and then tried to impliment them into my code. Now im looking for a new project.

Importing requests into vs 2019 is not really a thing that makes sense - at least stated that way. If it is installed then you can just use the import request command. But you have to know what it means to be working with the environment. it essentially means it's making a copy of your core python installation and giving it a special name so that whe no you install packages to it, it isn't installing it somewhere visible to all projects. This means two things for you practically. One is hopefully you install request in your environment and not your root python. more importantly you're trying to run your script inside of your environment because otherwise it won't see your installation of requests. In powershell if you just open Python and type import requests, it will either import or give you an error. Why don't you try this before you worry about what it means to do it inside of your idea.
I will look into this. Suppose some of the code are like scripts, is it still possible to execute them from another python script along with using error handling using try except?
Reminds me of the game of Life 🤔
Yes, thats because its the same just with a minor tweak to the rules: If a cell has 2 living neighbours it becomes alive. If a cell has fewer than 2 neighbours it dies. If a cell has more than 3 neighbours it dies.
should be, as long as they're python.
Be careful of overfitting any time-series data and be sure to split your test/train sets.

Im making Tetris using pygame and i have this problem. Here is the original tutorial no yt: https://youtu.be/uoR4ilCWwKA . Everything is identical, but i get this error. When i run the program it closes instantly but i can see the opening text for a brief moment. I would appreciate it very much if someone could help me with this. Im currently on 32-bit 3.6.4 version.
Mind sharing source?
I’m current reading Fluent Python and it’s pretty great with some focus on how it differs from a strongly type language like Java.
\&gt; So Unix/Linux doesn't really use file extensions to determine file type Of cause it does. In desktop environments, the best program to open a file is mostly determined by the filename. Magic numbers or other means to auto-detect file types are only tried if the file extension is not known. Try renaming a png file to txt and open it. This is not different than on windows. Magic numbers are only defined for (some) binary file formats, there is no standard for them, and even if you detect the file type by its first few bytes, it may not be enough. Many file formats are based on zip-files (odf, docx, ...) or other container formats, so a magic number won't tell you anything about the file content, or the correct program to open it.
I actually came across your writeup when I was looking for examples and was impressed with how smooth the sliders and updating was. The versions I made with lots of sliders and buttons became pretty sluggish but that could have just been the way it was written. It was also your model, parameter and composite model objects which inspired the function classes I wrote. Before that I was using the method of writing the function to a .py and importing it because I couldn't think of a way to add functions together on the fly. &amp;#x200B; Someone else mentioned this [http://hyperspy.org/](http://hyperspy.org/) package for interactive data analysis and it seems to be packed with features. Could give that a try
Would it be better to have conda installed via the .deb package?
How many frames did you train? And when could you see that the bird is actually able to pass the first pipe?

That package has me completely beat. You know I was planning to make a variety of tools like this including one for removing anomalous datapoints, shifting/trimming data, adding/removing backgrounds etc, all built on matplotlib, numpy and scipy. Looks like this package has done everything I've done or wanted to do but much much better. Even the "model" classes they mention sound like a better version of the ones I've written they're so similar it's almost weird: &amp;#x200B; \&gt;A model is constructed as a linear combination of components Yup. \&gt;that are added to the model using [append()](http://hyperspy.org/hyperspy-doc/current/api/hyperspy.models.model1d.html#hyperspy.models.model1d.Model1D.append) or [extend()](http://hyperspy.org/hyperspy-doc/current/api/hyperspy.models.model1d.html#hyperspy.models.model1d.Model1D.extend). In my case it's the '+' operator but yup. \&gt;There are many predifined components available in the in the components module. Yup. Made a "preset\_functions.py" file for mine with common functions. \&gt;Once defined, the model can be fitted to the data using fit() or multifit() Yup. \&gt;Once the optimizer reaches the convergence criteria or the maximum number of iterations the new value of the component parameters are stored in the components. YUP! \&gt;It is possible to access the components in the model by their name or by the index in the model. An example is given at the end of this docstring. Mine are also indexed in the same way. &amp;#x200B; It's pretty nuts that package has relatively few stars on github. I reckon with scientific data analysis, everyone learns their own way of doing things and creates their own shortcuts and modules for their needs. Even when a very complete and robust package exists people are just stubborn and would rather continue using what they always have. If you're at the point where you would benefit from using the package it's likely that you've already come up with some way of doing the things you need in a way you're familiar with.
Thanks.I will look into it
The invalid syntax is shown in line 10
This is just to quickly fit to X-ray data from one of my labs
Is another option. If you use the deb package you can install Miniconda (only contains conda and its dependencies): [https://www.anaconda.com/rpm-and-debian-repositories-for-miniconda/](https://www.anaconda.com/rpm-and-debian-repositories-for-miniconda/) Obviously, using this conda you can install anaconda. In any case, it requires a lot of time with slow connections and post-installation is needed to configure desktop shortcuts: Spyder, Jupyter...
It looks a lot more impressive than it is, if you check out my last version you'll see that it's come quite far in a pretty short amount of time. I'm just reaching my second year of learning python and had no prior experience with programming. Even though it's been two years learning python I was only using it for scientific purposes and didn't know what a list was until this year (only ever used numpy arrays). I also have only just learned to write classes so I'm by no means skilled or experienced. If you're somewhat past the beginner stage I'd recommend the book Fluent Python it made me realise how little I knew.
Very neatly written, and very informative. Thanks a bunch !
Sorry for spreading fake news I have very limited math knowledge. Is it that easy to fit even when the peaks are overlapping as much as op's? In general, the scipy aaand matlab libraries I found only worked for 3D + but I might have missed something.
Well the closer the means are and the wider the variance of each mixture component the more data you will need to obtain a good fit (i.e. the more the supports overlap), but either way yes it's easy to obtain an MLE/MAP solution even if it's not particularly close to the real distribution. In the limit of more data and compute the problem becomes incredibly easy.
Glad you liked it! I'm one of the developers contributing to it. I highly recommend trying it out on a single dataset and then moving to the multifit method, if you're trying to fit multiple (similar) spectra. &amp;#x200B; It's not as user friendly as your package, but it can do a huge amount of cool stuff. Let me know if you have any trouble with it, or just create an issue with your thoughts on the [github](https://github.com/hyperspy/hyperspy)!
Yes but in ops case it doesnt seem like they have a lot of bins to work with. Also, the case I was describing (which I should have specified) was when you are not sure how many peaks should be fitted by the model. I would think that such a problem has an extreme amount of possible answers and thats why I looked for a hackier way to provide an estimate.
Do you have experience in other languages or is this your first attempt ever?
Aside from learning classes and objects in Java, this is my first (successfull) attempt
EM for the univariate case generalizes to multivariate gaussians. Just use the pdf of the multivariate gaussian to compute log-likelihood. Chapter 22 of [https://www.inference.org.uk/itprnn/book.pdf](https://www.inference.org.uk/itprnn/book.pdf) might be helpful. This guy's thesis goes through maximum likelihood estimation and EM for the multivariate case.

thanks⁈
No idea what you mean by a lot of bins to work with. Anyway, you can use k-means and sweep over k to get a quick estimate of the number of mixture components before fitting your VAE. You can also straight up fit a load of GMMs with different components and pick the one with the highest marginal likelihood. In high dimensions it becomes harder yeah, but 2d? Pretty tractable. If we’re not concerned about picking a parametric form for our model then we can just use something like kernel density estimation and don’t have to pick a number of components at all and the whole thing becomes pretty easy.
One of the most popular flavor of Unix is MacOS, which uses file extensions *in exactly the same way as Windows* - to identify a file type, and also (via a file-extension-to-application-set mapping) which application to use when you activate it. And it’s not just limited to the graphical shell. Run the “open” command in bash - it determines which app, script, etc. to open according to... wait for it... file extension. Obviously, the web also relies on file extension. Whether your URL ends in .html vs. .pdf determines which renderer your browser invokes. Same for embedded resources: .jpeg vs. .h264. Is it archaic? Sure. In general, every organizational system should exhibit a complete separation of *identifiers* and *metadata*, because metadata schemas (either formalized or just your metal organizational model) have a nasty habit of changing or becoming complex. Better to manage the metadata complexity separately from the basic function of identity, which the standard should only require to be *unique*. Nevertheless, our current standard is to jam this little piece of metadata into the filename after a period. It is what we have for now. Not great, but not terrible.
This one’s easy. Look at your loop. You run through it once, filling your window and handling events, and then you call quit(). And then your loop finishes and restarts, and you try to fill the window again, and that’s where the error occurs. You see why?

Longer than a second for me. The fact that in the same post OP uses the word "Polish", referring to the language the Poles speak and not to refinement, doesn't help either.
Put very simply ML is using mathematics to train a computer to use data (in various forms, text, images, video) to take near-accurate actions. These actions could span from identifying patterns in a dataset that a human would take far too long to figure out to or, as in this example, determining whether a tap on the screen is needed to keep the bird from flying into one of the tunnels. How the latter was done was by allowing the computer to play the game over and over, helping it learn from its mistakes, until it became a pro.
Vanity project, I guess, but interesting basic concept, can be improved. The main issue: data and logic should be separated. The actual resume should be loaded from a file, and could contain variables or handles understood by your code to be replaced. Keeping that blob of LaTeX in the code is cringing. Second, the links to the projects from which stats will be pulled should be a list, and passed to the function as an argument, not part of the function. That's what the main is for. Assuming you want users to start playing with it, you want to make it reusable, and make sure it's easy for anybody to find what to modify for own purposes. Last, but not least: if you want your resume to be useful for anything other than cleaning the printer heads, you might want to get rid of global variables before anyone notice it.
You have prior coding experience?
idk why but i think AI is sooo cute (?) its like i had a son and hes learning things and growing up😭😭😭😭
Same bro 22 years old with a boring degree. Gonna watch YT tutorials!
If the inputs and outputs of your scripts are files (or just have scripts write “I’m done” to file), the using Make can be a great solution. Will stop on error, and with -j will run in parallel if possible. It’s not pure Python, but for simple task graphs I find it’s much simpler, and it works on any machine.
We have it on prod. Tryin to delete it =\[

Wow, you’d think he is too young for abc, let alone for ABC...
Numbers = [...] newNum = int(input(‘enter a number: ‘)) Numbers.append(newNum)
Numbers = [0,1,2,3,4] newNum = int(input(“Number: “)) If newNum in Numbers: Numbers.append(newNum) Edit: make sure the fourth line is indented or else it won’t work
Oh wow i have leant python for approximately the same duration, and all i know is making list and dictionary:(
Well, the Programm actualy is not verry complicated. Basicaly what I did is create a 2D list like this: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5GhlXhDfoE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5GhlXhDfoE) then I set them to 0 or 1 and look for their neighbours and apply the rules. The Result is the next generation as a new 2D list which I can print as a png with matplotlib. I then take these images and add them together in Gimp to form a gif.
Did you start learning python from scratch or did you have some knowledge before?
Only a small amount about classes and objects
Yeah, something along those lines 😂 The difference is that this “son” can learn much faster, has far many chances of making you millionaire and it won’t ask for anything in return (no money, no coming back home drunk, etc).
The code is really messy, if I get some time I can clean it up and share it. It is gonna take some time tho
Oh alright.

I made a scraper for a careers page on a big company site. Made it scan for a certain job i was waiting to open up. I was generous and made it run every hour. I don't condone people looping scrapers every 1 second.. Makes websites build shit to prevent that.
Thanks, everyone! I'm looking into all of them and will contribute to where possible hopefully! 😁
Yeah same at my company, V2 is used throughout still and nobody is yet using V3, I imagine V2 is still very much in play because it's easy to install from apt (it's just there) and also V3 means you need to rewrite all your fabfiles, all those historical projects..... I briefly tried to convert one to Fabric V3 but the way it handles SSH had changed (for the better) so I need to have another think about my approach. Once I start the ball rolling, others tend to copy what I do and the V3 rollout should begin.
Yeah... it's great how he "strings" words together...
From my understanding `monotonic` accounts for clock updates when your machine/server system clock drifts and happens to be corrected. For example, a lot of machine rely on [NTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Time_Protocol) to keep their clock synchronized. It could certainly make a difference on the scale of 10s if a clock update happens between two `time.time()` calls.
this comment made my day lol
Edit: thought you meant text to speech at first. I'm a little late to this but I vote on Googles new wavenet api for text to speech. I made a bot with it recently. It's very generous(if anything overly generous) on how much you can use it for free. I actually used my phone as a way to identify my voice. I made a simple udp server in python and used a udp plugin for Tasker. I used Taskers auto voice and put a shortcut on my home screen. When I clicked on it, the voice icon would pop up and let me talk. That's the event. The task would take that text and send it through the udp plugin to my python script on my pc. From there my pc would process what it needs to and return that with the Tasker plugin(on the phone) / api(computer) called join. Join is synced across one account.. So you can use the api on the computer and it will send they info to Tasker on your phone. So the profile on Tasker would be when you get a join message and the task/action would be to output it using wavenet. It's pretty nice. Especially because I can use this while on the go while away from home. Main thing here to get it working is that for the udp server code, I had to allow it in windows firewall and also had to forward that port in my router settings (which there are a ton of tutorials showing how to do that.) It's also nice because I can use my voice on my phone to say "restart computer" and my home computer would restart for example(which I already programmed in). You could use python to scrape websites and return the result, so "what's the price of *product* on Amazon?" for example and it would return that..or "do I have any new emails?", or you could do "turn off home lights", etc. One of the cool things I was able to figure out, especially being newer to python myself, is creating multiple queries and getting back a random chance from multiple answers... It reads it all from a dictionary. So for example, [("hi", "hey", "hello"): ["hey there!", "howdy!", "hi there!"]] .. It figures out if there's multiple values and will randomly pick a reply if so to make a more natural response. I'm working on making all the easy responses and etc be stored in a json file so I can make a large dictionary that way for responses. All custom responses for advanced queries would be in the script. One last thing about the udp server stuff, if you make a udp listener, make it so that it only recognizes your phones ip address and your local ip and give an access denied message to anyone else. I did this in a simple if statement. For some weird reason I got a connection attempt on the same port from another ip address so this is important. I chose this route because I couldn't find a better way and it's instant. Originally I used pushbullet to catch messages from my phone in python on my pc until I found out that it only has a message limit of 500 unless you pay money plus it wasn't nearly as fast. I explained all this in hopes that it might help in any way lol. I don't see why more people don't do this. As far as speech recognition on your pc, I'm not sure of the best one at the moment
but can s/he learn in **2015 12" Macbook?**
does make only work with output written to files?
You could say it's vanity but I wasn't sure of the frequency with which I should update the download count. I was thinking it might be extensible to things like github contributions etc. &amp;#x200B; I wanted to keep the LaTeX separate but I need the %s to format so if it's separate then it wouldn't actually be working LaTeX independently. &amp;#x200B; Right, I'll wrap the dl count fetching utility in a function so you could pass in an array of libraries to get the count for. &amp;#x200B; Do you mean the global variable to keep track of when it was last updated? If I don't keep it global then it would run the \`updater()\` every time the link was clicked. Not sure what to do on that one. &amp;#x200B; Thanks for the inputs btw! &amp;#x200B; Also, I'm not sure what would be the best way to get others to use it. There should be some way for a user to add a marker in their LaTeX so it's working LaTeX independently as well as replace the marker when it's passed to the function. And maybe I could think up a couple of things a person might want to update regularly and create functions based on that.
I think you mean you are still using Fabric v1.x (as was I) which is python 2 only, Fabric v2.x is the latest version that works with python 3. Before this I was actually using a Python 3 compatible fork called fabric3. Yea upgrading is a bit of a pain, I wasn't using too many special features though. My biggest issues with v2 are it doesn't prefix every line in stdout with the hostname anymore, and you can't type hint task args.
I've solved it in the meantime, but thank you for the response.
You can also wipe his memory and start him over again as many times as you wish. Real sons can't even do that.
There is no best way, there's only the way that works best for you. Try the gamification way, try the video lesson way, try reading it and try writing it. Although the best way to learn Python is obviously by learning the ancient art of pan flute snake charming. Only then can you ascend to true Snek Developer status.
most of the subreddit is about regular python stuff.....
Thank you that is very helpful. And I shall try the PaN fLutE SnAke cHarMinG method too

He uses a technique called Deep Q Learning
Hey thanks for the link. Had no idea
Thanks for explaining it :)
Looks like the Death Star plans from a new hope
YouTube tutorials
This is so cool and makes me want to get back into programming again. To see a beginner make something like this is pretty inspiring. Thanks for sharing and I’m looking forward to seeing the source code!!!
Well I've tried those and got bored quickly
Well it's just about motivation. If you're not motivated to learn then you'll get bored quite quickly, bit if you really want to then you'll keep trying. I learnt Python from YouTube when I was 11 because I saw my teacher using it and I wanted to show off to him. I tried learning C# but got bored too because I wasn't motivated at all.
What videos do you recommend nacause I watched videos that are 6 hours long and that's why I probably got bored
I just did a YouTube search and found this. The guy's voice is really clear and it seems easy to follow. It's the type of video that I would watch myself. It's also lots of (relatively) short videos instead of one long one. https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLei96ZX_m9sWS2gm1zGqGq6ZzU9T5QSg7
OK thank you
Wow, you succeeded at the project I started and gave up on in grad school. Excellent work!
code bullet be like
I meant the number of data points. I dont think clustering would work for data as overlapping as that but yes fitting it multiple times for differeent numbers of peaks should not be too expensive
Thank you for reading 😊

requests is available for python3, I have used it.
This should be asked on /r/learnpython. Requests is absolutely available for python 3, though I think the confusion is coming from requests version 3 not yet being out. Many people also just go for using urllib from the default library. It's up to you in the end, requests is very popular and active, and provides a few nice conveniences, I personally like using it.
I would recommend requests module. It is easy to begin with. With requests.get and requests.post you could do most of the request task with a few lines of code. See detail in its website. You will love it
Agree. Style improvements are very welcome, but it would be nice to justify that it's more than a matter of personal preference. Like, "I'm a professional editor/proofreader", or "I asked 10 naive speaking friends and they all agreed it's an improvement".
Oh cool. Yeah, when I was developing the code it seems to me that how many data points are the bigger issue with responsiveness.

All of these things only tend to improve with more datapoints... and yes clustering would definitely work with overlapping peaks.
Here is another really great resource for learning how to use requests: &amp;#x200B; [https://realpython.com/python-requests/](https://realpython.com/python-requests/)
Learning something really new is kind of like mutating or turning into a werewolf or something. It's like [https://youtu.be/cDz4ycVgXS8?t=77](https://youtu.be/cDz4ycVgXS8?t=77) You just gotta mainline it and the best way I found to do that learning python is to just bolt yourself into a seat and do everything in 'Learn Python the Hard Way'. If you want to find that book, just google search it and put "ext:pdf" at the end of your search and you'll find some copies out there in the internets. I recommend you figure out python 3. It's better for you. Bonus points though if you get a Learn Python the Hard Way for python 2 and then do all your work in python 3 because then you'll know. Brew up some blonde coffee and put [this](http://www.infinitelooper.com/?v=Z6j63ImEKyo&amp;p=n) on in the background and just spend an entire day.

I started to develop simple Python library of debugging utils. Basically it allow you to add a debug decorator for a function so you can better debug it when it runs. It also respects Django's settings to make sure debug is off. See more: https://pypi.org/project/python-pydebug/

I imagine it's reinforcement learning and there's no set of training frames
I added a folder called "newest prototype" on the [github page](https://github.com/St0neA/Gaussian-Lorentz-Fitter). Running "interactive\_fitter.py" should work.
Well then remember me. I am u/mrasadnoman

What’s everyone’s favorite theme for PyCharm
&gt; The code is really messy We've all written worse :)
Sorry, I just subbed to that sub now! &gt;It's up to you in the end, requests is very popular and active, and provides a few nice conveniences, I personally like using it. I have a rule when it comes to learning new libraries or languages which is essentially "go with the herd". So if requests is what most people are using, then that is what I will go with. &gt;I think the confusion is coming from requests version 3 not yet being out Ah ok yes that makes sense... So requests 2 and requests 3 are not mutually exclusive to python 2 and python 3?
I think you would likely get more feedback if it was on a github account or online somewhere else rather than forcing people to open a .zip. Not sure if you're looking for feedback or anything, but here are a few things: - take a look at your goldFinder3() function -- it will have issues as you are using the == instead of an assignment operator. - I haven't used the pyautogui -- but it may make more sense to collapse the four functions into one -- they seem to be doing the same thing. Just do a collect of those pngs and go through the same function over and over and feel free to yield (instead of a return) when it gets a hit to do work. - this looks like it should be maybe 20 lines. It has piqued my interest though :) -- makes me want to boot up Cookie Clicker again -- and maybe look for some golden cookies.
Yup, that's right. Happy learning!
Hey, how did it go for you with Fiverr?
Don't be sorry, it's the subreddits that are wrong. No human anywhere is going to think they want to learn Python and guess that they should go to /r/learnpython. They're going to guess /r/python. I'm sorry you were treated this way.
Better to get in the habit of uploading everything to github early. Learn github or use the GUI they have for windows (it's actually pretty great). It will save you later.
That didn’t answer either question. But, thanks.
Reinforcement learning still learns on frames, and it's common to ask how many game frames it took to get to X level of play
Oh, but it seems like you have given birth to a C programmer. It's `eat_food(self, food)`, not `self.eat_food(food)`, right? He's just passing a reference to himself.
Thanks. Will do, maybe not add your unhelpful noise as well.
What are we supposed to do with the files in the trained\_models folder? None of them have an extension...
Thanks for your day old Necro post karma farming easy rules. I saw it after I posted. Notice how no one but you responded. Lowest denominator, "plaguing" newbies. Bye Felicia.
I would love to know how to train an AI to play a game but I feel like this post gives insufficient data and the github page is insufficient as well. But this may be because of my lack of understanding. Could you please elaborate for those of us who are beginners in Python controlled games, what are we supposed to do to make this work?
It's pygame
Very trippy
Congratulations on your progress. Keep up the great work, learn, practice, become the best, teach the rest. :)
You should also try reading previous posts. Someone asked this exact same question one hour before you posted your question.
Exactly. So why are people saying it's impossible to represent Python objects with JSON?
Awesome work! This quite inspires me to study AI/ML in Python. Btw, not sure but I think you're the same guy who posted this in Python PH community group on Facebook.
NOW THERE'S A REASONABLE ANSWER! Thank you!
Amazing. Thanks for sharing.
Speak for your own. A quick roofie and a little tinkering and he is back to saying da-da

Thanks for this. I have looked into making an isometric game with PyGame but I don’t even know where to begin with it haha. Have done a server-client messaging app. I posted it here not long ago actually. Was called FyreFly. These are really sound ideas though I just need to try start one and see it through!
Nothing, no leads
Once, I turned a bash script into a CGI! Really, OP, you have nothing to lose other than some advice on how to improve. Do people remember/know what CGI is/was? It was just a simple script that ran queries against various LDAP instances and compared version #'s.
Keyboard layouts are platform specific issues. If you want to deal with keyboards you need to talk to your OS and have him do something. Linux uses Xkb or other similar tools to remap keys. Typically it's just a matter of calling a local program, but said program might be configured differently based on the layout. It would help a lot if you explained what you're trying to do, otherwise it's impossible to help you.
But have you gotten any other job after the previous one though?
Im learning about webdrivers!
Does it matter if it exists? Just create it and maybe it'll even be better than the existing alternative. Unless you don't care about the programming experience though and just want the working software
I would guess that these are the weights for the neural network.
True, true. But like 50% is useless ^^
I'll lool into it
Thank you
Just pick a project that you really want to work on. I was always amazed by cellular automata as soon as I learned of them. But now I actually have the time to learn and code them. If you have a project you want to complete then its hard to run out of motivation.
Thanks for your kind words! ^^
In one week of learning Python, OP makes a game of life cellular automaton. In one fortnight, OP creates AI to play the game of life in real life. In one month, OP's AI becomes sentient and starts calling itself Skynet.
Use split function ;)
Can't because there isn't any definite pattern. Plus if I split based on spaces, then there will be many in unwanted words

Why didn’t I know this. Thanks @ubernostrum, you have just made my life a bit easier.
Look for patterns. Like "(is) hiring" always comes after the company name, with the exception where you have (company name) raised 10m and is hiring, or smth like that. This is how I would do it, I'm curious about how others would do it
You need Natural Language Processing... this is a rather huge topic, but you can [start here](http://www.nltk.org/book/).
So it's for me it's two solutions machine learning or define pattern
Yea i found it.
Thanks, seems like this will do.
Define pattern is a no go, because it's a small data set, imagine big data sets. I think the machine learning solution too
Im going to try this out. Thank you.
AIOHTTP for non-beginners, much better than requests.
It's worth reading through all the posts here, even just the first page, since you get to see the errors the other posters make and the suggested fixes. I know a bit of python but I still read most posts because it keeps me current with the sort of problems being encountered, plus sometimes I learn something! It's also worth [reading the FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/FAQ) to see common gotchas we hav all tripped over.
I intend to do this. I have been learning Engineering the wrong way for a long time. Figured, I'd find out a way to keep myself interested while learning python would be better too.
Nice job my fellow Vietnamese! BTW are you interested in doing more of these *let your machine teach itself to play*? A while ago I've written [a small shoot-em-up game with friendly API for remote control](https://github.com/McSinyx/brutalmaze/wiki/Remote-control). I really wish to have someone to try it out using ML. My rule-based AI reached 304 IIRC.
I think it would not work, because there are many other possible patterns. And what if this data set might change some day, then the code will break. So it's not a good solution then. I'm curious too :)
`a &lt;&lt;= b` is the same as `a = a &lt;&lt; b`.
Great result for your first week's work. It says a lot about you - and Python! I join the others in encouraging you to share your work on GitHub as you develop it. Beginners will learn from what you do, and you'll get feedback if you ask for it. In my experience the Python community is very well-mannered and supportive.

As you might expect, others have tried to solve this problem, mostly using Deep Learning tools like TensorFlow or PyTorch. It's generally referred to as *Entity Extraction*. There are closed-source commercial solutions which are used by recruiters and others. The problem is not trivial to solve. If you Google around 'deep learning entity extraction' you'll find lots of papers on the topic. Some will have links to open source code. It's also worth asking your question in some of the Deep Learning on-line communities.

I just want to know if its something somebody already thought of, and if so, it might give me ideas. I plan on building my own either way
I thought it's a "one time project"
It seems you've already extracted it from a webpage, if you do your parsing off of the raw html you may find tags that could help your search. Otherwise yawpitch already mentioned Natural Language Processing. It's been a couple years for me but there are certainly python libraries that can analyze the text and at least categorize each of your strings as noun, verb, etc. This is called tokenizing You can cross reference your nouns with a list of cities to identify the where. Then your verbs should give you a clue to the identity of the who and what nouns remaining in your problem. If you want to try a more statistics/machine learning heavy route, you could add a correlation table to your decision making process. Last time I did this, it was a probability table of how likely a word is to occur after a certain word, for all combinations of the other words. "hiring" will be highly correlated to "is" for example. iirc, this is the essence of markov chains. That may be overkill but interesting enough to mention glhf!
Right, requests is the defacto standard, but other libraries are available.
I just did this a graduation project for upper secondary school but used C# and neuroevolution instead. Keep up the good work!
Thaths the same impression I get. You guys arr awsome
It’s just like activating this world with computer! Great job!
Today if I deploy a web server based on python 3.6.8 on RHEL which has default python 2.7.5 how much of a problem would it be when the RHEL version is upgraded ?

I started off learning syntax with the course on Codeacademy, and after learning basic syntax had a "now what?" moment once I finished, since I wasn't yet familiar with text editors or IDEs. Later, I discovered Automate The Boring Stuff, which is aimed at non-programmers, and I appreciated the combination of approachable style, wide range of libraries covered, and the fact that it had a step-by-step set up guide (for Windows). It's a great book for getting started when you have no idea what you're doing.
Thanks!
Yes, thats what i found on the learn python sub reddit. Also python crash course by the same author. Seems like the best way to me.
I'm French and I'm always looking to improve the languages I speak, so I love to get any kind of feedback to help me correct any mistake I would be making. Therefore, I'd say go for it! Just try not to be too "dry" in your PR message, because people receiving the PR may have never heard of you or of your goal.
Ordered this on Saturday from the description alone. Due to arrive tomorrow. Glad it's reviewing well.
Okay, then to answer your question: no, I don't know of any such software :-)

Thanks so much! I was about to rip off my shirt while trying to find for answers.
1. Learn how to ask questions on the Internet so you can get a constructive response. Generally this includes stating: a. a concrete task/goal. What are you trying to achieve? b. your setup. What have you done? Preferably including code and OS / python / libraries version. b. the problem: why doesn't it work? Preferably including error message/traceback if applicable; screenshot if needed. b. what you've tried to do to solve it, and why that didn't work. Preferably include concrete code and results. 2. ???? 3. Profit!
Open terminal. Type python. You've got it all installed already.
Take a data science course.
What's everyone's favourite type of dog?
What did you used to print the points?
I performed the calculations on a 2D List and printed it with matplotlib. I exported the images and then created a GIF in Gimp
What command on matplotlib you used?
Use a local instance of [Graphopper](https://github.com/graphhopper/graphhopper) perhaps? It isn't that complex to set up, and when you have that amount of routes to calculate, having local execution saves a significant mount of time.
Well, I was thinking I will do some Python, but my website said something different..
Might I suggest the same thing...but different. First, build the game (game?) again but with different logic/construction. Then, implement the entire process into a single script (I'm thinking input a seed value, output a gif).
Can you please post a link to that tutorial? Thanks
I am going to be that guy: 1. string formatting SQL queries, always bad, I would [bandit](https://github.com/PyCQA/bandit) to you static checkers stack 2. you have 3 parts io (read), cpu (transform), io (write) you can scale these different parts differently. 3. If you use COPY to write might as well use it to read to. also jump over the sqlalchemy directly into psycopg2. 4. ideally PG-&gt;S3&gt;lambda transform -&gt;S3-&gt;PG is how I would do it (such that the transform lambda can live outside the VPC), but if no, you can (for once a month) get a pretty capable [spot fleet](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/spot-fleet.html). 5. if you are worried on buffer overflow you can use [SpooledTemporaryFile](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/tempfile.html#tempfile.SpooledTemporaryFile)
How is being codeless an advantage? It's the completely wrong approach. You want to version and write your tests with your IDE, and keep them in your repo, not login to a website and spend hours to click your way through something you can type in 5 minutes.
I signed up for their free trial with gave \~£250 worth of credit, my 4,500 geocoding requests took up about \~£20 worth of that credit. I think you'd be fine doing your project on their free trial.
If your job is to sell a particular solution, that's what you have to sell, no matter if it makes sense or not.
Hi! You are talking about Google?
so satisftying, i can watch this forever
Why is AWS an advantage? You can just buy your own servers and build your own datacenter and hire engineers to take care of those servers. Why would you bother logging into AWS and launch new instances with 2 clicks when you can do that by yourself in 5 weeks.
Yes, sorry I forgot to mention that in the original comment.

I got to like 157 no code once before. It took ages!

I can manage AWS instances with terraform scripts, version them, comment them, rollback to a previous situation if I want to. I am certainly not logging into AWS and to things by hand. Do you want an untraceable mess? because that's how you get it.

Seriously. It's insane that people want to sell this paradigm when it's wrong. It's like Windows all over again. UIs have their place. CLIs have theirs. If you bolt on a CLI driven mechanism with a GUI you better be sure that it simplifies the workflow, not just make it obnoxious.
Why use a gazillion emojis, when they convey no meaningful addition to the alleged technical content of the spamvertisment?
You do know that those codeless solutions also have APIs and automatic backup systems, right? Users are running their tests by calling the APIs from their CI/CD systems. They also have Activity sections, where you can trace everything. I get the feeling that you're either from India or Eastern Europe and you haven't even tried a solution like that in the last few years.
1. /r/learnpython 2. Start by figuring out what `def mangle` does to `self.a` and `self.b`, then figure out what you should set `self.a` and `self.b` initially to get the output you want.
Thanks, I will explore it, cheers
Yes, Fabric 1.x for Python 2 and Fabric2 for Python 3. I use it for Python code remote deployment, database migration and updating some system software configurations

Just something to waste your time on :) [You can find the source code here](github.com/aleksilassila/text-moba)
Good to see that there is a book for wxPython 4
[pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) is great for testing on the command line
Still has a free tier, you just need to have your credit card on record and billing turned on. You will get $200 for 1 year the first time you sign up too.
Nice. Good luck mate. If you can also please share some details on the courses you took on udemy.
Asynchronousity makes 0 sense as a beginner concept. Use reauests for synchronous requests, some derivative for threaded ones, aiohttp for use with an event loop (if he even needs it). If this comment is made out of some hate for Kenneth given the recent things he's done, hell, I'm more of an antagonist to him on that than most people here but I'm not going to start to disavow every project he ever worked on.

Because freelancers are generally not going to maintain your code, and code generally doesn't get written to be used once and then thrown away.
I am trying to make a program that fullscreens on launch and you can’t get out of it, I got the full screen thing down, now I just need to disable the keyboard so you can’t exit out of it, the program would be running on windows
If your main product is a software product or if you have a long running software project, hiring is much cheaper than contracting out.

When you say you used a 2D list, is it like a ?matrix/2D array?
Hired coder involved in development and maintenance of an application knows not only what the order part of code does, he has a general understanding of the whole system, can navigate and support it. It saves time and money for a company, because you dont have to spend so much time dumbing down the task to the outside worker, dont have to negotiate price, you are more likely to get desired result in the designated time as well.
This question is not about python, it is about what is a percentage. Also that doesn't look like a good idea to name your variables int and str since those are the types. Do you know what it means to say that USD is -0.1197% of GDP ?

Yes. The answer is always yes.
Thanks for your advice! Also, your probably right about how it should only be around 20 lines because I’m a crappy programmer.
New to Python, thanks for sharing!
"Fluent Python" , then "Pro python 3", then "Modern Python Standard Library Cookbook". Have Beazley's "Python cookbook" in mind as a reference. Then move on to lib/framework you need.
I am from the UK and APIs are pretty useless if there's not a scriptable environment that allows me to script efficiently these tests, but that's beyond the point. The sole fact that such UI is considered as a selling factor is a fundamental flaw. Nobody should structure their test like that, and if they do I certainly don't want them to be part of my team.
It shouldn't matter
Try it. have fun.

I think its called a 2D Array, a list containing lists. Each list then represents a row.
What layer are you talking about? You can call that API request directly from the webhooks of your Jenkins or Github, you don't need to construct any layer. In 2005, you would hire a Test Automation Engineer just to write: driver.get("https://www.google.com") driver.find_element_by_id("searchInput").send_keys("nerd") driver.find_element_by_id("searchButton").click() Now you can just do that with codeless instructions and you also get the cross-browser cloud infrastructure at your fingertips. Any site or app also needs functional tests. With codeless tools, you can also re-use components and and you can manage values with variables, just like you would with a programming language. It is estimated that you can create a test with a codeless tool 10x faster than with a programming language and you spend 20x less time on maintaining those tests, due to the Element Locator Hierarchy functionality (also known as self-healing tests, which adapt to the changes in your UI). You're clearly on the technical side and I can see that you've never been on the Management side. It's all about getting the job done and staying within the budget. I'm sorry, but if I would manage a project and I would want functional tests, I would want them done as fast as possible, to be as stable as possible and within budget. And you know what happens in some cases? Someone from the team, let's call him Igor, will say "Why should be spend $50/month on this solution? I can code it myself, give me 2 weeks". And after 2 MONTHS when you have a major release and you ask him what's the status with the testing framework, he will give you an answer like this: "Gradle build not working, issues with latest deployment, give me one more week". And at best you'll have some flaky tests running on some headless PhantomJS browser on some Linux machine, totally irrelevant for your production users. And in those 2 months, you spend way more than $50 on paying Igor and the rest of the team. Because that's how Igor does everything, he paints his own house, he hangs his laundry instead of using a tumble dryer, etc. I bet you're not even using Slack. Why should you pay for it? When you can just use Google Hangouts or Skype, am I right? And don't worry, if you will ever have a team, I don't think a lot of people will want to be part of it if you don't change your mindset.
Another option is [HERE Maps Api](https://developer.here.com/documentation). Their freemium plan allows up to 250K requests per month and does not require card info. If I'm not mistaken, you can use it to get routes, so it should work for you.
This is sick!
Here is code using PySimpleGUI that rotates displaying of images. I've not done all the necessary resizing, etc, to make it work on all photo sets (getting placement right).

r/learnpython That's a more appropriate place to ask.
yeah I tried to use this the other day lmao, trying to get a working one lmao
yeah have you made one yet?/
Lol, good luck. I'd so recommend starting from scratch
Reminds me of a [DOS game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FMS9Q7Kl2c) I used to play when I was super little!
Try to maintain compliance (Systems and Organization Controls, PCI, etc) and only use freelancers. The burden of finding freelancers who even know what it is would be tough. Not to mention the freelancers themselves become their own compliance burden. Sometimes having staff makes sense beyond the normal reasons (continuity, familiarity, maintenance)
You'll probably get a better result from asking in /r/learnpython.
You wanna check numpy for huge speedup. This is what you will need for every homogeneous array operations.
No worries I actually just did it, well I didn’t do it but basically I found someone else’s broken bot and fixed theirs

&gt; What layer are you talking about? You can call that API request directly from the webhooks of your Jenkins or Github, you don't need to construct any layer. I don't want to do that. I want to write code and settings that I can commit to my repository. Why do my tests and my settings be detached from the code? &gt; In 2005, you would hire a Test Automation Engineer just to write: &gt; &gt; driver.get("https://www.google.com") &gt; &gt; driver.find_element_by_id("searchInput").send_keys("nerd") &gt; &gt; driver.find_element_by_id("searchButton").click() &gt; &gt; Now you can just do that with codeless instructions and you also get the cross-browser cloud infrastructure at your fingertips. And have that vital part of your infrastructure deployed somewhere you can't reach easily Would you also propose to write our code on a remote server as well? Maybe by just connecting boxes with links. Yeah that will work better. &gt; Any site or app also needs functional tests. With codeless tools, you can also re-use components and and you can manage values with variables, just like you would with a programming language. It's impractical, requires connection, and it's not accessible. I can use whatever IDE I want to code. Once I am in with these tools I have to obey to their vision of the world, and I am fully tied in with their mechanism. I can't switch to another provider. I have full lock in. No thanks. Have you ever tried handling something like Jenkins or Teamcity and their slow, garbage interface? Have you ever tried to setup travis by just committing a damn yaml file to your repo and see things happen? That's why. &gt; It is estimated that you can create a test with a codeless tool 10x faster than with a programming language Bullshit. Link. &gt; and you spend 20x less time on maintaining those tests, due to the Element Locator Hierarchy functionality (also known as self-healing tests, which adapt to the changes in your UI). Again bullshit. These tools are hard to manage, hard to track when something goes wrong, and if something goes wrong, you have no control over it and you go insane to work around their "smart healing" crap. &gt; You're clearly on the technical side and I can see that you've never been on the Management side. Wow, tell that to my team. &gt; It's all about getting the job done and staying within the budget. Yes, and having been on the management side I can tell you that what I don't want is to have tools that are completely detached from a reliable workflow. &gt; And in those 2 months, you spend way more than $50 on paying Igor and the rest of the team. &gt; Because that's how Igor does everything, he paints his own house, he hangs his laundry instead of using a tumble dryer, etc. And that's equally wrong. But I can guarantee you that no matter what, I am certainly not losing control over my testing infrastructure through a UI that is completely idiotic for this task. &gt; I bet you're not even using Slack. No I use Teams. &gt; Why should you pay for it? When you can just use Google Hangouts or Skype, am I right? &gt; And don't worry, if you will ever have a team, I don't think a lot of people will want to be part of it if you don't change your mindset. Yeah, maybe you were one of those who really pushed hard for CORBA, or XML, or Delphi, back in the days. Guess what? They are all gone. Because they were impractical, overhyped garbage that wasted everyone's time.
Why don't you make one and then see if one exists using it. It'll be great experience.
&gt;r/learnpython Thank you
Thanks for the compliment! Any idea why hyperspy isn't as smooth? Also I'm having a bit of trouble with the imports. Using "import hyperspy as hs" and then using "hs.signals._____" gives "AttributeError: module 'hyperspy' has no attribute 'signals'". I can however do from hyperspy import signals and it all works. Am I importing incorrectly?
At least going by the [home Assistant Waze sensor](https://www.home-assistant.io/components/sensor.waze_travel_time/) the [Waze API](https://www.waze.com/sdk) is free to use (for now, I'm curious to see if they close it for Gmaps).
You can try to use GeoPandas for this, although the API is a little bit of a mess.
Dont want to sound rude but people should check their basic maths skills before jumping into programing or it will get confusing really fast.
Whats better to use pygame or curses?
Different tools for different purposes surely.

r/learnpython But yes, look up the selenium library to automate tasks like this, or do it yourself with something like beautifulsoup.
Dude the asterisk hitbox is OP
That is so cool! How would you go about building a server/client system?
I like your "mine is mine" attitude! :D keep us posted about the githup repo ;)
I'm pretty sure I fixed the issue with version 0.2.2 actually if you want to try again :)
Take a look at python libraries socket and threadig, they should get you started! Also you can read my code and try to understand it. Right now its kinda messy but I try to improve it and add documentation in future.
Thanks &lt;3

I have a better question: why does being the "fastest growing programming language" really matter? Is this really a metric you care about? Does it even matter how many people use it beyond some point? What are you actually trying to _say_ with that data?
This week I am continuing my summer focus on learning Python: doing a 100 Days of Code challenge, completing Py Bite challenges, and working through Python Crash Course by Eric Matthes and Automate the Boring Stuff by Al Sweigart - both excellent resources. These things, combined with applying what I am leaning to my own needs, should set me up well going in to the fall with a good Python foundation. What do I love most so far about Python? After many years of PHP/Web development - I love that I am using a local interpreter and can code interactively in a shell!
This [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmachinelearning/comments/bmdvgh/how_do_i_feed_three_inputs_into_tflearns_input/) I made recently pretty much sums up what I’m working on. I have yet to figure out how to do what I initially wanted to do, which is to convert a tflearn DNN model built to take one image as input into one that takes 2 images and a one-hot array. The post got no responses and I’ve yet find the answer to my question via other channels, so I decided to try merging my 3 inputs into a single image input via a preprocessing script I wrote. To represent the value of the one-hot, I’m using openCV to put a text string in the upper-left corner of the image. I have been training the model for over 48 hours now and it just completed its first epoch a few hours ago. So far the Tensorboard charts show much better accuracy and loss than the first model trained on the unprocessed data. I’m looking forward to finally getting to test my model sometime later this week. After that, I plan on either balancing my train data across the nine possible target variables or adding more preprocessing that ups the number of combined inputs from 3 to 7.
What’s selenium?
Google it?
So I'm not going to comment on whether I believe the politics are justified or even true, but I'll give a breif explanation of what (appears) to be going on. A couple weeks ago (and making the rounds again last week), palantir, the company behind the project was found [to have developed software which in some way aided deportations](https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/03/palantirs-software-was-used-for-deportations-documents-show/). A [protest ensued](https://www.fastcompany.com/90348304/exclusive-tech-workers-organize-protest-against-palantir-on-the-github-coding-platform), and it seems that [issue panels of at least some projects by the company are being mass flagged in some way](https://gizmodo.com/palantirs-github-page-is-the-new-battleground-in-the-fi-1834680574). It doesn't seem as though this repo was bombarded (it's hard to tell, I'm on mobile and can't easily count if any issue / pull numbers are mysteriously gone), but others definitely were. So they probably just set that on all their repos before anyone could continue the bombardment. I don't know about how anyone else feels about the political situation, nor do I really care, because my policy is OSS and politics should be separate. You wanna protest palantir, sure. Don't impede their OSS contributions though. Unfortunately it is evident the exact opposite (the bombardment of issues/false flags) occurred. E: they did not enable that setting for all repositories, but more than just the one you linked has it enabled. Maybe they enabled it on those that they predicted to / got false issues, and then removed the false issues and I can't tell.
Ok, the only thing I got was that Selenium is like a library to automate tasks. I know I can automate tasks, but can I make them interact with websites and other programes? Like, let’s say, log in into my account, and then perform this task if this happens, etc.
Obviously I was goin to do that, but I would appreciate a bit more help from someone willing to give a hand to fellow colleagues. If you do not want to answer someone just starting out just don’t answer, but you didn’t clarify anything. It’s like someone asking for a recipe and a guy saying “eggs and strawberries”. 😒
For video games: pygame.
Use pygame for games that use actual images and are played in a normal window. Use curses for games that use text and are played on the command line.
Selenium is a library that allows you to remotely control a web browser from your program. This includes navigating to URLs, clicking buttons, extracting content from the page, and so on, and it works with a real browser like Firefox or Chrome.
Yes, you can automate the login process.
Wow, that sounds amazing. I was worried because the definition I got was “Selenium is a tool to test your web application”, which is not what I was looking for, but I suppose as you said that I can just test/use any website with it. Regarding interacting with websites, can I (somehow), make the program read a chart “live” on the website and make decisions based on conditions? Maybe Python can’t do that or, in order to get the chart and the information from the website for Python to use, I may need privileges?. Too many questions. I understand this is not something I will not attempt anytime soon, but if I know it is possible it will definitely help me.
Hi! This looks great! What resources did you use to learn curses? I really wanna learn how to make programs in curses. Thanks!
Selenium can absolutely do what you're describing. You can have a website open in a browser, and you can subscribe to get notified when the chart changes, then get the data you want into your program and process it like any other data, with the full power of Python.
That’s mind blowing. I appreciate all the comments and help. Thanks guys!
A faster growing language means there is a bigger growing community and more opportunity to receive help when you need it.
So you want to talk about how helpful the community is? Why not use StackOverflow stats for, say, the number of answered questions?
It’s really simple library to learn. One fast way to learn it is just by watching some python curses introduction video on youtube. Google is also your friend: a lot of questions you may come up with already exist out there with answers - just google it. When I started creating this game I read one of those python curses snake game tutorials which also helped me to get started. Happy coding :)
Interesting, thanks for sharing 🤔
Thank you.
Yep, you're missing the ".api" after hyperspy. So, it's "import hyperspy.api as hs". It's more the instant-response interaction of your program that I meant. Hyperspy fits it really well too, but doesn't have that same dynamic feel too it. That said, it doesn't actually make sense for hyperspy to include it beyond helping find initial parameters before the first fit. The fitting algorithm works by giving a least squares method, so after giving it initial parameters it performs the rest "objectively", which your method doesn't. Another aspect of the smoothness - I typically use python in a jupyter notebook (and call the "%matplotlib notebook" magic for inline plotting). Its really nice for layout, but the fps and latency of the inline plot is a bit slower than the qt implementation that I think you're (probably automatically) using.
How does this apply to any sort of lab report? Beyond that there is nothing conclusive to indicate that Python is the fastest growing language. In fact I’d argue that it has peaked. Languages like Swift and Rust are also growing fast and frankly have far more long term potential. Swift is especially interesting due to being able to run a REPL and take the same code and compile it. In a nut shell a lab report should not be a place for promoting highly debatable information. Almost all of these public language rankings are suspect, biased or just plain marketing garbage. Even if an honest and correct evaluation can be found today it will likely be outdated tomorrow. I just don’t see a reason for such info in a lab report.
How much do they pay you?
Oh look, it's endtest spam, almost never see that on tech subs....
I'll definitely be using data from Stackoverflow and Github. Are those the two biggest programming websites?
I guess so.
This is really interesting, but why is it `import rules ` and not `from prodmodel import rules`?
I've saved to take a look later. Looks good
For a smaller project or less 2-3 months freelancer hires can be good, however if your main business depend on that software it would be better to hire a developer long time. Like others say freelancers write code, not maintain. Hired developers do both. Freelancers are quite useful however always ask the hired developers before offloading tasks to freelancers, higher number of people doesn't really mean faster product development.
This looks amazing. Wow.
You get an upvote for making me chuckle with the title
Thanks, that is the kind of stuff I want to know but I'd like to get good numbers for it. It is still important because I would like to discuss in my presentation why I used the language to my classmates. If they had 2 months to implement a program for a small experiment I would recommend python instead of rust or swift because of the size and hype of the community.
Thanks for the input, I didn't see those news.
I just got immediate crash Traceback (most recent call last): File "C:\Users\*\Documents\GitHub\text-moba\server\src\main.py", line 3, in &lt;module&gt; ip, port = sys.argv[1].split(":") IndexError: list index out of range
Thank you I’ll look into this!
If you're talking about "Python Cookbook, Third edition" (Beazley, Jones), then it's still a damn fine resource regardless of when it was published. Much hasn't changed since it's debut, and it's filled with timeless information and how-to. Just get it; you'll be fine.
Introducing? Mate, `mypy`'s been around for at least 4-5 years.
Glad if you like it! I do it this way so i can test the examlle project with a local dev version of the code. You're right, for users it should be from prodmodel import rule (though i think both works). I should clean this up somehow.
Looking at the source, you need a ‘:’ between the ip and the port when you start it, like 127.0.0.1:8000

Ongoing work on custom web/gui AX framework and for fun a quick module to layer encode, segment encrypt messages.
I am going to suggest that you use a programming language that you like, and has support for the types of program you write, instead of going down this popularity circlejerk.
Rob someone's identity with python!
Oh I guess just new for me then. I saw the article and was like "you know who might like this? /r/python". My bad.

You need to perform key suppression. On Linux this is done by simply "grabbing" keys through X11, which gives you events from it, but also prevents the event from being sent to anyone else then yourself. You can use [`python-Xlib`](https://github.com/python-xlib/python-xlib) to do this kind of thing. After you've performed the grab and got an event, you can send it back to another device with something like `Xlib.ext.xtest` (in `python-Xlib`) or [`python-uinput`](https://github.com/tuomasjjrasanen/python-uinput) (which creates a new virtual keyboard device). After you ignore the events sent by that device to ensure it gets through normally, you will have "remapped" a key using your programs logic. You can checkout the [Plover `oslayer`](https://github.com/openstenoproject/plover/tree/master/plover/oslayer) as an example of how it can be done. Plover grabs/suppresses a lot of keys, processes their states with stone rules, and sends them back as another set of keys.
So the main thing you used was curses?

What's the scope of your project? &amp;#x200B; If you need a static webpage made for your extermination business, a freelancer may be right for you. &amp;#x200B; If you want a complex web application that handles booking and real time GPS tracking of your exterminators across multiple cities with API connectivity to Facebook, Twitter, and Reddit, then you're probably going to want to hire a programmer. There are very good freelancers, but they are not usually the correct market to build and maintain complex SAAS applications.
Yep, I use it to draw everything on the screen.

4 frames, sir
your guess is correct :)
I tried to implement without using pygame but unsuccessful :)
It took me 2 day for code and 1 day for train
exactly
haha yes
=)))
Hm, isn't this a bit much for essentially scp script.py user@machine: ssh user@machine python script.py

++1 to this. Lots of free options for setting up a local instance of some geo data and calculating routes. You're just looking for travel distance. You don't need to have up-to-date super-accurate turn by turn directions for this use case. Might be a trivial amount of records to push to Google now but if you want to calculate distances for more records, you'll appreciate having a solution you can run locally.
Hi, I think it is better if you get familiar with python first. Then you could take some course about neural network
thank you :)
Hey there! I'm pretty late to the thread but was curious if you could elaborate on the creation and teardown of VMs part? I understand (from a conceptual standpoint) the docker part, but not the VMs. I work with VMware so I usually drop the guest utils in, then use something like Ninite to grab the software... Have you automated this process? If you wouldnt mind sharing, that'd be awesome! Thanks a bunch :)
/r/learnpython and read the sidebar.
Learn python for data science from scratch in 3 days? Bold promise.
I am familiar with Python. I'm not familiar with "python-controlled games", and I'm also not particularly familiar with github. I don't know how do you make a python script control a game. That's what I'm curious about.
We originally had written a wrapper around VirtualBox that we used for creating, interacting with and tearing down VirtualBox's VMs. Unfortunately, that didn't scale that well and VirtualBox seemed to cause weird kernel panics to occur that we were never able to stop. &amp;#x200B; So we switched to docker and wrote some Python scripts around spinning up containers, tearing them down, etc.
Things like the community are good to mention. So are the huge number of libraries that one can access instantly via pip. What I have a problem with is references to questionable facts which is what most of these language surveys are. A labreport isn’t a place for fanboy like writing. Instead relate information in a way that is accurate. For example pip gives me access to xxx,xxx number of apps and libraries. I used xyz libs to accelerate my development. Something like this that is verifiable and reflects your success with the project.
