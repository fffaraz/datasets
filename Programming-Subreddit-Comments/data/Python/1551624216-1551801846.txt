No problem! I'm still doing colt Steeles course as well.
Thanks. :)
Ah, my bad!

Wow. Make such simple things into a library so others may just import and use it :)
Yes they're safe. If you didn't know already, you can see the sourece code of libraries .. 
Sign me up. James Walton - jameswaltonmk2@gmail.com. just getting into python. Got most of the basics down and looking for a group of coders to work with.

Very Nice. Works Well.
I’m interested!

No it was a total failure. 
Wow, that's too much hate to handle.
Once I get a bit better in Python, I think I will try something like this too, thanks for idea! 
I use to manually package cli into GUIs at work (using wx and a GUI builder). I've since moved as many of these as possible to gooey. If you can stand the output being a little clunky, then I think it's a great option. 
Make the entry point to the library a method or class and get everything from method parameters? Flake8 has other ways of doing it because it's more command line tool than library.
First, this belongs in /r/learnpython The error is explaining the problem exactly. You're passing a float as the first argument to a function that expects a list.
It's the Indian way
Make a POC of each and performance test them!

Programming is very, very hard. If you're going to do it and the way you do it is going to be hard no matter how you do it, you might as well choose the paradigm that will make your life easiest in the long run. There's a million reasons why you should write OOP over procedural code.
Generally you’d pass any config into the library class to initialise it as key value pairs, otherwise fall back to defaults. A great example is the Flask web framework!

Pip handles your external libraries so it wouldn’t effect your system Python if you ran ‘pip uninstall &lt;package&gt;’ 
That's good to know! I'll have to grab a copy
Damn , everyone here is so pro.I wonder when will i be able to build such complex stuff ;-;
@bedomohamed, I'm in. I need help on methods, instances, objects, etc. I'll pm u.
I’m surprised you don’t base your publication on this software, and how it helped you invalidate your approach. That sounds like good science to me...
Thanks for the kind words!
Hey sir! I've here for the project, and not for the feelings *^(/s)* Great job bts
Programming language difficulty or populatity do absolutely nothing for security. If anything, a language that is less popular or more difficult makes it harder to audit. You don't need to know anything about the programming language to hack it, most attacks don't care what the target is written in at all. If you want to write secure code, there is no simple answer, there is no other way than define a threat model, and then evaluate the entire system against it.
I understand. Thanks anyway you helped a lot. I did more research and found autoitx3 module for python which it's pyautoit. It's working great now. 
Also a factory for the entry point to load configuration from whatever you want
Nice! Looks promising.
Dissenting opinion: don't use dataclasses. It was a mistake to make them public. Use attrs, which existed already, you can use on whatever versions of Python, etc. etc. dataclasses are a welcome addition to the stdlib, because in fact the problem here is something we should have solved a long long time ago, and the stdlib itself has plenty of need for a solution, and no option to use the external library. It's just not a problem we needed a *new* public library in the stdlib for. If you're an end user, use the long-existing good library support for doing this.
Are data classes similar to case classes in Scala? I recently started learning a bit of modern Python after spending over a year heads down in Scala, and the way the docs outlined them, they sounded very inspired by data classes.
Security through obscurity is not a viable option, really. You don't want your application to be safe because the technology is not widely used. Actually, it's the opposite: your app should be designed in such a way that it's secure even if literally everyone perfectly understands its internals.
Call a function or two on a class before you call a run method. For example, I read a large binary file with large results. I can suppress specific results /read specific results (both are options) or alternatively I can take what would take up 60 GB of RAM and dump it to an HDF5 object that basically uses my SSD as RAM. The read method already has 10 parameters, so I stick those less common parameters on separate methods.
It doesn’t take much to test out and review features of libraries. Build a POC with openCV and see if that works for you. OpenCV is very easy to use.
Impressive. Everything you just said is wrong. Really, really wrong. 
It doesn't take all that much to turn a great utility that you like to use on the command line into one with a GUI that your colleagues will feel comfortable using. [This early article on PySimpleGUI](https://opensource.com/article/18/8/pysimplegui) focused on how to take Python programs from command line to GUI window. In the ["ReadTheDocs" document on PySimpleGUI](http://www.PySimpleGUI.org) you'll find an early "[Tutorial](https://pysimplegui.readthedocs.io/tutorial/)" that also talks about converting a CLI application to a GUI. Some of the terminology and capabilities have changed since the articles. Look at the sample programs and the [Cookbook](http://cookbook.PySimpleGUI.org) for the most up to date design patterns. Should you wish to run your program in the browser, the new PySimpleGUIWeb package will help with that. It's still at a very early stage however. You can run a few PySimpleGUIWeb programs online at [this replit repository](https://repl.it/@PySimpleGUI).
FWIW, I try to code an hour a day. I count my feeble attempts on SOLOLEARN, FCC, DATACAMP, etc as time put in. It's hard having a family/job/life - but this c0ding is fun! 
Yeah, this feels very javascripty. &amp;#x200B; Not sure why I need classes at all... it's just extra code. Why not use dicts
Wow, nice! Can You show me your code? Meaby github or something else?
Well I appreciate you taking the time to educate me (and everyone else) as to why.
Is this definitely a library, or is it a standalone tool? If it's a library, what does the library provide? If it's a standalone tool, I'll defer to the other great answers in the thread. This post is an admonition against configuration in a library *per se*. Usually if your library provides functions and classes, no configuration is required. You just call the functions or instantiate the classes. One should be wary about "global" configuration of a library. There are some notable exceptions (flask, as mentioned, but I might call that a "framework" and not really a "library"), but generally it's something to avoid, because it means there's only one "use case" possible per interpreter invocation. Further, it divorces the tuning of the library from the code. It therefore makes automatic tuning harder on the client code, because they don't have direct programmatic access to the knobs. So if you've got a library and not a standalone tool or framework, please think carefully about the interface before doubling down on a meta-code configuration approach.
You’re welcome. 😜 Sorry, I’m out right now. I’ll reply seriously a little later today. 
You have a lot of old code commented out. That is something you can remove. It will help the readability.
I'm interested too !:)
If dataclasses are a solution to a common problem, why is it a mistake to make them public in stdlib? Just because attrs has been around for longer?... That doesn’t make the stdlib solution less legitimate or less beneficial for the Python community.
Dang I bought Steele’s web development bootcamp but didn’t know he had a Python one. I bought 2 other courses for Python. What course do y’all plan on doing next? Might be able to do it

Golang's binaries are static by default. In comparison to C's dynamically linked binaries they're huge. In comparison to Python's static PyInstaller binaries they're tiny.
nice. were you able to verify the common most popular closed form solutions to the field equations? other than schwarzschild, of course.
Yes actually. You will see them in some of the tests but I have tested most of them. I need to write better tests tho...
I recently also saw [EinsteinPy](https://github.com/einsteinpy/einsteinpy) which does something similar... or not. GR is beyond my expertise ;)
I would say golang still has an advantage over other compiled languages because unlike other's, it's a trivial matter to cross compile with a single command. You can create a "static" executable for Windows on a Linux machine with 1 tiny command. Try that with any other compiled language.
Why did you decide to go with python for symbolic calculations? Normally Mathematica or Maple is used for such things.

Hi there, from the /r/Python mods. We have removed this post as it is not suited to the /r/Python subreddit proper, however it should be very appropriate for our sister subreddit /r/LearnPython or for the r/Python discord: https://discord.gg/3Abzge7. The reason for the removal is that /r/Python is dedicated to discussion of Python news, projects, uses and debates. It is not designed to act as Q&amp;A or FAQ board. The regular community is not a fan of "how do I..." questions, so you will not get the best responses over here. On /r/LearnPython the community and the r/Python discord are actively expecting questions and are looking to help. You can expect far more understanding, encouraging and insightful responses over there. **No matter what level of question you have, if you are looking for help with Python, you should get good answers**. Make sure to check out the rules for both places. Warm regards, and best of luck with your Pythoneering!
I am interested, please follow through!

Has anyone compared Mutmut to [Cosmic Ray](https://github.com/sixty-north/cosmic-ray)?
If you are on Mac you can wrap this in a small apple script that takes input and invokes your script as a new process with these arguments. Then export the Apple script as an app which you can place on the desktop and run by double clicking. Another idea is if you are better with web, you could spin up a web application that you just run on localhost. The web app could invoke the scripts in a child process. You could even display the output of the script to your user in dat fresh Bootstrap 4 modal. E.G with Node https://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html#child_process_child_process
GetModuleFilenameA() does this from C/C++ &amp;#x200B; import os print(os.path.dirname(os.path.realpath(__file__)))
I tried Cosmic Ray on the same project. It was harder to run (the instructions are a bit out of date, and while running it shows no progress, so it's not clear what's happening). It didn't find any surviving mutants, so it didn't end up giving me any useful results.
If it's a library called by other python code, or framework that calls into user code, you don't usually need external config like this as others have mentioned. If it's a standalone/ command line tool, personally I would go with one thing that works, which it sounds like here is env vars. Wait until someone asks for some other config method or until you get tired of having to look up the names of the env vars each time you use it, before considering the question. Chances are, YAGNI ...
I'm also a big fan of [structlog](https://www.structlog.org/en/stable/).

That's worse than I would have predicted. In any case, at least now you can even run cosmic ray without first setting up rabbitmq! I kinda shamed them into fixing that with the launch of mutmut :P
&gt;while running it shows no progress, so it's not clear what's happening). I had the [same issue](https://github.com/sixty-north/cosmic-ray/issues/219). I never did get around to trying to implement it... And now that I read the issue again I also see that mutmut was recommended to me back then! 
Mutmut can't be be run in parallel, that's my big missing feature compare to cosmic ray. Otherwise I belive I beat them hands down on everything else. mutmut: - finds better mutants - is faster single threaded - enormously better code: shorter, easier to understand and modify - usability that blows cosmic ray out of the water. For most projects just install and run and great feedback - ability to apply mutants on disk and more cool features coming super soon like just mutating based on a patch file. Because the code is small and easy to work with we can do cool stuff easily. Of course, as the author I'm biased but just try them out and you'll see I'm right :P
This would have helped me so much in grad school! It would have saved forests worth of trees computing those christoffel symbols. 
Yea, I unfortunately had to be an ass and go around in their issue tracker to contact their disgruntled users. I got chewed put by the main maintainer for doing it which is fair. But also, if he can't make his project good I think it's also fair they I steal his users :P
Right!? I would of passed grad school!

Nice. It's pretty rare that I do mutation testing but I'll definitely give yours a shot :-)
Kotlin can do this, too. Kotlin can be compiled native, for JVM or to JavaScript, which is pretty awesome imo 
I’m so glad that python has made into the mainstream scientific community than to the fringes of Silicon Valley cats. I’m in medicine, and Python has so much potential to liberate hidden data to uncover the truth. 
&gt; Python logging module lets you create loggers using which you can log different levels of messages. I'm out.
Thanks for the guide, very easy to follow. Few comments: * There's was no motivation to use FileHandler and Formatter as logging#setLevel (an instance of logging instantiated by `logging(__name__)` )both take file and format as it's argument. * It is example given for logging#exception is redundant. The ZeroDivisionError message is as useful as the logging#exception message specified. * From the point above, wouldn't it be more useful to always log every exception error without having to catch it all the time with logging. Would logging catch all exception as critical level or error level logging?
This will probably be really helpful for me over the next few years, going to grad school for this! Thanks for the work, and for sharing.
Sizing up requirements for writing python bindings for nvme-cli and supporting multiple versions of such. I was going to do it as a LGPL licensed project in my free time. Then use it at work as an imported module. I don't think I'm going to take it on because the multiple versions aspect is a little ambitious for a single developer. 
Who mentioned procedural programming?
Is there any alternative to videospider? Since they dont let you create an account anymore. Also your discord link is no longer valid.
Might I suggest that you use enums instead of strings for the index_configs? Allowing arbitrary strings will always be slightly more error prone and require more parsing and error checking, leading to a (slightly) tougher user experience
Yeah I took the server down since I released source code and no I don’t know any other services, had no idea they stopped sign ups
Good suggestion. I never much liked the string configs. I will make a ticket github ticket.
pythons most successful game library is renpy. anyone telling you to use pygame directly has likely never shipped a game.
I like udacity
it might not be the answer you wanted, but he is right
I think you can dip this with like two lines of bash script. Not trying to rag on your project, I just think sometimes python isn't always the best tool.
this is a stupid question considering this is the Python subreddit. Besides Sympy is a pretty nice replacement engine for either of those things
No, but I do personally phrase it differently as... "it's so great that we can use C in Python - have the performance of C and the convenience of Python". Though I am still aware that I'm screwed if I wanted to change something in the C part (and this has recently occurred to me a couple of times actually). I guess I'm just saying that it bit me when I couldn't just go and change the thing I depended on...
Oh yeah I definitely could've done it in bash, but I wanted to practice programming/scripting in Python.
i saw one of those that unpacked a base64 which i thought was kind of cheating, much like using exec.
You may want to take a look at https://github.com/szsdk/quick , which draw gui with qt for the click library.
just nest list comprehensions. i cant be bothered to write it, but it'll work.
Saying somthing that is "right" without providing an answer is easy and useless, go look at other comments to see what I meant and asked for. 
If you're interested in Python for data analytics/science, I suggest Datacamp. If you're looking for general Python courses, Michael Kennedy's courses at Talk Python to Me are very good.

/r/learnpython and read the sidebar 
I don't think so. I was wondering why he uses python for symbolic calculations in his research, when Mathematica or Maple are the standard. Sympy is not a replacement for either of those, I've tried it and sadly python (or sage) do not compare to Mathematica in this regard. I'm not questioning why he posted this in the python subreddit, it's actually quite cool, but I would just not have expected python being used for this kind of research.
Interesting application! I’ll need to read up on Einstein’s field equations(and relativity), though.

Working on a DSL-based crawler for crawling swaths of data in a few lines of code inspired by [node-osmosis](https://github.com/rchipka/node-osmosis) to Python, and learning asyncio during the process. An [old article](http://aosabook.org/en/500L/a-web-crawler-with-asyncio-coroutines.html) from Guido really helped me understand asyncio in all its depth. For those interested in the crawler, you can check out the Python port [here](https://github.com/mscavnicky/hypotonic).
You're comparing your list `scores` not the iterated item `score`. It should be `if score &gt;= 60:`
Thanks for this explaination. 
Ok thanks I understand.
Please read our sidebar
/r/learnpython and read the sidebar. You're comparing scores to 60. Scores is a list. You want to compare score.
Please read our sidebar
Good for you! well done, I'll take a look 👍
Sorry about that, ill make sure to post there from now on. And thank you! That helped.
This helped! Thank you! 
&gt;name 5 please. There's a factory for that.
&gt; They're more like organized collections of related data than something you'd use in OOP. Simula-style, single-dispatch OOP (which is what Python has by default) is about organizing data and the related functionality in a class. So I'm not sure I understand where you are coming from. IMHO they are **exactly** what you'd use in OOP... SQLAlchemy and Django both ship with them. Enthought traits has some aspects of them. And SQLAlchemy is about as OO as you can get in Python. 
A hint - you should look at the `GROUP BY` statement in SQL. I don't want to do the whole homework for you. Please use the /r/learnpython subreddit for this question. This isn't the right subreddit.
It’s unfortunate, since that’s what the article opens with...but I think that it’s the worst sentence in the entire thing. It’s actually pretty clearly laid out if you just ignore the opening paragraph. To those of you who check the comments before the article, give it a read anyhow. 
Looks promising, will take a look

Check Scrapy Cloud, it was built specifically for hosting Scrapy projects/spiders: https://scrapinghub.com/scrapy-cloud
Back in 2003 when I started learning Python, I started by the official guide, if you go there there's a *tutorial* section that says *start here*. That was the only source I used and I never went to any other sources for learning Python. What I did was *trying* to make *something* in Python, and when I was stuck, oh well, there's always Google and Stack Overflow. Here's the link to official Python tutorial, I assume it's still as good as it was in 2003: [https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html)
Such is life in the great decline.
This is what I do, but I've been doing it for so long I can't remember why some of these things happen... ### # Find the Script, Folder, and Called Name ### import inspect import sys from os import path if __name__ == '__main__': script_folder, script_name, called_name = (None, __name__, __name__) for entry in inspect.stack(): if entry[1].startswith('&lt;'): continue if entry[1].upper().startswith(sys.exec_prefix.upper()): continue called_name = path.split(entry[1])[-1] script_folder, script_name = path.split(path.realpath(entry[1])) if getattr(sys, 'frozen', False): called_name = path.split(sys.executable)[1] script_folder, script_name = path.split(path.realpath(sys.executable)) if not script_folder: called_name = path.split(sys.argv[0])[1] script_folder, script_name = path.split(path.realpath(sys.argv[0])) sys.path.append(path.join(script_folder, 'lib', 'python')) else: called_name = path.split(__file__)[1] script_folder, script_name = path.split(path.realpath(__file__))
Based on that reasoning, the scientific community would never switch to Python. It takes people moving important scientific tools to Python to get people to use it. There has to be some positive feedback loop, only then will things be developed. 
Although I will say that the realpath is important in case of alias, shortcut, or symbolic link. The rest is for less common things. 
Because encapsulation. If I have a method that only exists to modify a value inside an object (and in python everything f is an object) it makes sense for that function to be part of the object rather than part of the global namespace. For example, in Go you add to an array with `myarray = append(myarray, 42)`. In oop languages arrays are objects with their own methods so we do `myarray.append(42)`. Given the option I find the second option much easier to maintain. I can change the append method in a given class or instance to chang how it works without changing how it works for every class or instance with and append method.

Hey, don't get disheartened by the downvote(s) and lack of response. Folks on this sub tend to want to see news relating to Python, and python packages. /r/learnpython is the place to go for feedback on this sort of work, and I'm sure people will be happy to help.
I'm glad to hear! I'm always interested in any game hacking also! If you have git repo or smth I would love to check it out!
Ok, thanks! :D. Is it allowed to copy and paste this post on that subreddit or should i delete this one first?
whenever I want to learn, naming convention / how to implement foo and bar. I look at git-cola source code. &amp;#x200B; For UI/UX of what pyqt can do. I see calibre UI. then decide what match to my own app workflow. The source code not so 'easy to read' though since it has very large and complex codebase.
I never know that Orange3 use Pyqt. Thanks for sharing.
Quite an arrogant title, no?
Use the API. That's what it's there for, and I promise you trying to scrape them manually will be slower and harder to do. You can make 15 api calls (to an individual endpoint) every 15 mins and each one returns 5000 follower ids. So run your 15 calls, get your 75,000 followers and then do whatever processing you want to do to them. Then if your 15 mins aren't up, have the program wait (the API can tell you how long until your next window), then repeat as needed. If you're looking at a use with a huge number of followers, just let it run overnight or whatever. It's not really that onerous.
Ctrl + Alt + L 
Your explanation actually makes sense, I'll try the API and see what kind of performance I get. Also since I'll be using 1 core of my CPU to process everything that 15 min window will probably be less than my computation time. Thank you for your answer
This is essentially an ad for some online courses. No useful info in the linked document. 
I’ve done this before - make an API endpoint that hits a script. Make the URL constructed of arguments. Works pretty well, and you can really expand this with advanced functionality over time, and make the backend robust to handle many users.

Bit of a trick rather than a keyboard shortcut. My memory is terrible, and I cannot for the life of me remember key combos. I also do about half my work in Jupyter, and getting the keys between both harmonised is a pain. So I bought a Logitech G14. Initially designed for people who play World of Warcraft and the likes, some developers love using it because you can set up application specific shortcuts on the crapload of buttons you get. It's fabulous, and it solves the multi-IDE problem for me. For instance, I can save a LiveTemplate in PyCharm to act as a macro in Jupyter, so that I get the same thing pressing the same button. Macros also have relatively good feedback, and you're guaranteed not to run out of keys (there are four sets of modifiers). If anyone is interested in my layout, I'm happy to share.

I always do ctrl alt l-o to optimise imports as well.
/r/learnpython Substrings: index it, like a list. Case sensitive: it's this way by default.
Ctrl shift a to type the name of some action to perform, eg vcs annotate, also shows shortcut for it if one is available. Ctrl shift n search files by name Ctrl n search class by name Ctrl alt shift n search symbol eg function name Ctrl alt shift c copy reference to current symbol, great to slack someone what you're talking about Ctrl alt shift insert create scratch buffer which is language aware eg JSON Alt j for multi selection, i use this way too often to do text editing
 # why would I use two different kinds of # format characters when a single one is fine?
The thing is the function requires that the default argument cause the search to be case-insensitive. But if the user changes the default argument to false then it makes the search case-sensitive. 
Put it in a function and give it a docstring. Code should be as self-documenting as possible (sane variable names, separate functional units into functions with sane names, group related functionality into modules). If you're doing something complicated and algorithmic, or writing illegible code for performance reasons, then sure, throw in a couple of comments, but relying too heavily on long block comments can be a code smell, IMO.
Ctrl + E: Recent files with fuzzy search
Would this have applications in refactoring code, such as renaming variables within a scope?

Very helpful thank you. I’ve just started working on a project that uses all types of logging and this really clears a ton up. 
It's not that simple. IRL the vast majority of hacks happen thanks to well-known applications a lot of people use - like phpBB, Wrodpress, Joomla etc. Because the vast majority of potential intruders lack the skill of finding potential exploits in a black box. I've seen a lot of crappy proprietary code as well, but it rarely gets hacked exactly due to this reason unless people do some appallingly stupid things like using concatenation to form SQL requests from the user data input. So I'd say security through obscurity kinda works. Sad but true - there is a lot of shitty code out there, and had it all leaked, it would be a disaster for those running it. If the code is open, it all comes down to who's better at understanding the security - the software architect, or the potential intruder.
Since no one else answered: Encapsulation, readability, assisting with open/closed principle, organization, and intuitive interfaces. That being said, OOP has its place and it's not always the right solution.
I love Loguru and began using it for all my logging. It gets rid of all the boilerplate and complex setup.
I have no idea what you're talking about and there's no possible way you can expect me to given that description. I'm out.

I've recently been using this a lot...especially when tracking down CBVs in Django 
Why? xD

Ugh thank God for this post. I have a bunch of support scripts I've been meaning to shift from CLI to GUI but every time I look at tkinter's docs, I gag little and close the tab. Thanks OP!
It could be leveraged to refactoring, but currently the form analysis results stored is not very friendly for that use case. Python ASTs can be parsed from source code via `ast.parse`, and can be unparsed via https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Tools/parser/unparse.py .
&gt; as far as I know there is a lack of support for windows compared to Mac That is absolutely not true. Step 1 is to go to python.org and download and install the latest version of python (3.7). As well as python, the default IDE named IDLE will be installed. 
I already have 3.7 64 bit install thanks for the reddit link good to know there's a place for the newbies like me.
&gt; If you're doing something complicated and algorithmic, or writing illegible code for performance reasons... That’s exactly what I’m doing. I agree with your overview though. 
Glad to know :)
Python can run on any OS fine. Python for dummies is the book you're looking for. r/learnpython is the place you should be looking at. 
In that case, I'd definitely go with a function - such algorithmic blocks tend to be fairly short and self-contained, and if they're to be called from somewhere else it's helpful for someone to be able to see the explanation for what it's doing without having to see the implementation (i.e. looking at the docstring). That also nicely separates the "hold your nose and plough through it" code from the code which is meant to be read.
Mind sharing what you hate about tk docs? It’s part of stdlib so i’d assume it would have robust docs. Disclaimer: i haven’t checked. I believe PySimpleGUI wraps on tk you might find that easier to use. 
But, who uses the (+,-,-,-) signature? 
OOP is great for easier scaling and maintaining the applications. The other approach for easier maintaining and scaling if you want to use funtional way is to create different files like classes and call then from the main file. The output can be reas through shared buffer, but yeah... it's not what I would do for this scenario. Oop is the way to go for maintaining..
If you installed 3.7 from python.org (not a 3rd party like anaconda) then you have IDLE installed already, just search for it in your programs. 
Your numpy is ancient. It's also not an official release. Get a different version, like numpy 1.16.
There are still places that such _useful_, things, which aren't necessarily "high impact", "high novelty", or otherwise "sexy", can be published. Workhorse specialty journals or even broader mega-journals like PLoS, PeerJ, etc... 
Definitely knew I needed this in my life too. Thanks for code! 
Ctrl+shift+up/down arrow to move a line
Regarding "No need to convert dicts to objects and back", you could make a base class that initializes all the properties in the dictionary that you pass in via the constructor (see [this link](https://www.blog.pythonlibrary.org/2014/02/14/python-101-how-to-change-a-dict-into-a-class/) for an example) and then have your other classes subclass the base class - that should save you a lot of templating. Likewise, you can override the `__repr__` method to convert the object's properties back to a dictionary 
You're looking for ''' Long comment here ''' /#/ &lt; this is for single line comments
Yes, I used this approach so far (with **kwargs in __init__), but being able to completely avoid it seems an even better option since database data is natively a dictionary.
Yes, there would be a separate file for every data model, except there would be no class inside, just functions. So the structure would be pretty similar to the OOP approach, except for the need of having objects (and doing dict-object conversions). So far I don't see any hint that this would be harder to maintain than OOP...
Alt+enter to auto import. I haven't import any package by hand for a while.
Ctrl+Shift+N then use CamelCase search (ex. typing "HW" to search for "HelloWorld")
I found the same to be true. Our product falls neatly in the microservices+big data domain and phasing out most of the classes was a breath of fresh air. 
Use of parapgrahs in writing is almost as important as comments in code ;-)
True that OOp is always optional in Python. That's one of its beauties. It's always up to you how to implement. It sounds like you want to try doing it sans-OOP. I say go for it. My only caution would be not to make a choice solely on aesthetic factors, but let your design choices be informed by the requirements. Classes offer the benefit of organizing code, even if you don't use any OOP patterns. Classes != OOP in Python. There's no reason to eschew their use unless doing so provides a tangible benefit. One common pattern I use is to create an Arguments or Params class whose `__init__` assigns `**kwargs` items as attributes, AND assigns the args dict as an attribute. Then I have both, and can do other stuff in the init.

The scientific community already uses Pythen extensively, but every language has its pro and cons. Symbolic calculations is not one of python's pros. After more than 14 years of development, [Sage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SageMath) is still nowhere near Mathematica for symbolic algebra/calculus. I would have loved to switch to python for this, but Mathematica is just so far ahead.
**SageMath** SageMath (previously Sage or SAGE, "System for Algebra and Geometry Experimentation") is a computer algebra system with features covering many aspects of mathematics, including algebra, combinatorics, graph theory, numerical analysis, number theory, calculus and statistics. The first version of SageMath was released on 24 February 2005 as free and open-source software under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 2, with the initial goals of creating an "open source alternative to Magma, Maple, Mathematica, and MATLAB". The originator and leader of the SageMath project, William Stein, is a mathematician at the University of Washington. SageMath uses a syntax resembling Python's, supporting procedural, functional and object-oriented constructs. *** ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Python/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28

As for me, I'm using django on Windows and there are no problems :) 
You will need anaconda but most things work. Only thing I had a lot of problems with was pyspark. But if you run into issues you're pretty much on your own as there aren't that many blogs about running on Windows 
It did in the past 1-2 minutes. 
It is good science. But that is why it should not be publishable, as it should be the standard by now :).
&gt; You will need anaconda Source? I've been using python on windows for like 8 years. Never used anaconda.
I’m pretty new around here. Care to elaborate?
Not really. I don't like weird blogs like "Here's regular expressions in 100 easy lectures" or Flask, but I love when people post the interesting projects they've been working on. It's cool because smart people are prototyping the most forward thinking ideas in python these days. Today someone posted about `mutmut`, mutated testing, and it was really exciting. I should go back over the past week I think there were 3 other similarly really cool mind-expanding projects. 
This is one of those things that even though it has no real utility to me, I really want to understand it and put it to good use. Sadly all I know about physics (and programming, lol) is... nothing.
Python for windows works like a charm!
2. `logging.exception` is not really redundant. Because you would not get the traceback information if you had just used a `print("Division by zero problem")`. 3. `logging.exception` is associated with error messages. So it would work for all messages that are at error level and above. Without catching it with an try-except block the program would stop. So I guess its necessary. 1. Didn't understand the first point ..
I use Python on Windows with vscode. It works great. I've tested Django (not flask) and no problems. Unlike Linux, there's no system wide default interpreter, so you'll have to [manually install](https://www.python.org/downloads/) the interpreter(s) you want to use (or you can use anaconda, which I've never done). About Django, [sentdex's Django video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0_1DPmfKM&amp;list=PLQVvvaa0QuDe9nqlirjacLkBYdgc2inh3) is done on windows if that helps.
I've been here for a year and noticed paid-advertisements...I HATE THEM. 
Thanks for the reply. It seems like a useful project, but perhaps too esoteric for most readers of this subreddit.
It's total shit
1. Let me rephrase because someone else on your website pointed out the same problem too. You did not need to use the FileHandler and Formatter because the following is equivalent: logger = logging.getLogger(__name__) format = '%(asctime)s : %(levelname)s : %(name)s : %(message)s' fname = 'logfile.log' logger.basicConfig(format=format, file=fname) The following statement you've made &gt;The `FileHandler()` and `Formatter()` classes are used to setup the output file and the format of messages for loggers other than the root logger. is not true because logging#basicConfig is usable not only for the root logger (i.e., logger.basicConfig) &amp;#x200B; 2. That's not what I meant. I'm saying the example you've gave was redundant because you could've done this: ... except ZeroDivision error as e: logger.exception(e) # Or # I believe this works as well logger.exception() ... Instead of creating your own custom exception error log "Division by zero problem". This is what I mean by saying the example is not useful because it's redundant. I can however see some situations where Python's default exception messages are far more useless than &amp;#x200B;
[Here's an example from one of my open-source libraries](https://github.com/ubernostrum/webcolors/blob/558bd81a917647ea2b392f5f4e9cd7ae5ff162a5/webcolors.py#L638). It begins with a comment to explain what will be going on in the later comments. And [here](https://github.com/ubernostrum/webcolors/blob/558bd81a917647ea2b392f5f4e9cd7ae5ff162a5/webcolors.py#L791) is one that has to break out and provide meta-commentary on what it's doing in order to implement what the previous comment said. And for those who don't want to click through to read and understand why it's complicated: that library, among other things, implements the HTML5 color parsing and serialization algorithms (like the one that parses "chucknorris" into a color). It intersperses the exact wording of the HTML5 spec, as comments, before each step of the code, to make it easier to follow and understand why it does some weird-looking things.

For mathematically-oriented stuff you should take a look at numpy. Cython is also worth taking a look at.
That is ctrl - D
This is gonna be an obscure one, but it's still handy sometimes. If you double-tap and hold ctrl, you can use up/down arrow keys to expand the caret over multiple lines. It's sometimes useful when converting something to a class and I need `self.` multiple times, or when i'm editing things to a dict.

Auto generation of BMC remedy tickets via rest api calls for my team.
dragging middle click, or alt+dragging does it too. I use this constantly. Parallelize everything! 
I do a similar thing with my K70 keyboard. The software it comes with allows you to reprogram any button, with profiles that will switch based on what program you have selected and open. Works a (Py)charm.

I just discovered that Ctrl + / comments out the highlighted block and I'm still shifting bricks about it. Works in Sublime Text 3 for any language as well

I don't understand a lot, but it sounds like you are very passionate about it. Looks very well made!
os.path is superseded by pathlib. from pathlib import Path HERE = Path(__file__).parent
It’s not clear what your actual question is...
Kids have such a unique perspective on things! Feeling humbled. Thanks for sharing!
They do! You're welcome. 
She doesn't know how lucky she is
ctrl+F1 donot know what it does but then also like it &amp;#x200B;
On some larger and less-tidy codebases, it is exceptionally nice that I can *scope* the IDE's format-fixup to the blocks that I'm actually changing.
If you have access to the data of the charts, perhaps you could make some animated visualization with the timeseries data, like in this article: https://link.medium.com/vlr1lZQhMU If you only have the images of charts, maybe you can just select/trim/combine them into a video with some web video editing tool of your choice.
For real though. These days kids have a ton of resources to learn anything. I didn't have these when I was her age. 
First half: mostly downvote Second half: mostly upvote I have no clue what to do with your comment other than assume OP will have zero idea what to make of it
That’s very impressive. My 5 year old niece can’t even read and refuses to attempt any kind of math 
Is it really that way or should these questions go here and the other stuff in a subreddit like pythonlanguage that is only about the language itself? &amp;#x200B; i think the problem is that so many different types of topics get mixed up here. i think we should use tags to separate questions regarding the language from questions regarding some code, and tags for courses, tutorials, news, self made stuff that would help keeping it clean
I was way dumb when I was 5. The thing that got me interested in programming was how I can use it to solve real world problems. Ask your niece to count the number of candies in an m&amp;m pack and she could have them if she's correct. Start them small. 
It seems to me that most of the subreddits are plagued with these kind of posts, not just /r/python. I've seen them on /r/devops, /r/startups, /r/entrepreneurs, /r/marketing , and basically any other niched community. It's really sad reddit is turning to that.
Alt + f4 actually completes the whole project for you!!
Yea I don’t remember being 5 but pretty sure I had the mental capacity of like an 8 year old.......cat
If I remember correctly, the IDLE is not called "IDLE" in the start menu shortcuts anymore, but I can't remember what it's called.
A tool to scan a directory of images, search them for corporate logos and report statistics on how often different logos appear. Then do a tool to collect random frames from YouTube videos and save them to a directory. Use both tools to assign a “sell-out” rating to YouTube influencers.

I've used [scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/editor/) to teach students when I was a TA. They weren't exactly as young as your kid but still it's a good place to start. 
Yeah fuck every time I see a blessed kid post. I went through sexual assault and bullying until my college years.
Thanks! I'll look into it. 
Does anybody think that kids are getting smarter on an average with each generation?
Ctrl+shift+m: matching tag. Works in HTML, J's, python...
I am sorry to hear that. I hope you are doing well now. 
If you have an understanding of Python, you can move on to machine learning tutorials like this one: [Tutorial: Getting Started with Machine Learning in Python](https://stxnext.com/blog/2018/06/28/getting-started-machine-learning-python/) I helped write it, so I can vouch that it will help you execute your first project. It covers how to load a data set, how to run a machine learning algorithm on the data, and how to assess the performance of the algorithm.
I definitely think so. And we need their smarts to solve our problems. 
\&gt;Not starting with 'Hello world' I'm afraid this kid is now doomed for all eternity. She's going to grow up to be a PHP dev. 
Dang, can't wait for that. I should probably teach the kid how to read first, though. Look up Scratch, it's made for teaching programming!
I'm sorry to hate on Scratch. The overwhelming consensus on any programming forum is Scratch is terrible. The GUI is clunky and kids might be more frustrated to manipulate the blocks than the write the actual code. It's supposed to teach logic but actual logic is better at that. Scratch creates good animations but does not offer much control. Alice is marginally better but if you're niece understands the terminal just typing simple stuff out is the best.
Alt + J for multiple selection. Alt + Shift + J for undo selection of single item during it. Also hold left mouse button, then hold left Alt and move mouse down or up, and you will get similar result. Incredible feature, but seems useless, while you do not use it once.
Excellent commentary on the dangers of AI by your 4 year old cousin.
&gt; "Computers are really dumb, it says a cow has 8 legs!" Apart from having learned to open the terminal and use the REPL, she found out something very integral about programming. Good job!
Wasn't 3.6 already out? 
Admittedly I’ve only been on it for a year, but in comparison to other “general” language subreddits I’ve been on I’d say the quality of the not-obviously-for-learning posts is relatively high. For instance on r/rust every few posts is a screenshot or video from an unrelated game, usually filled with all sorts of mindless “color commentary”. I’m honestly surprised the feed for this subreddit isn’t a constant stream of jokes from Life of Brian and Holy Grail. I would say there’s been a strong trend in the language generally towards more entry level users and English as a second language users, so I’m not surprised by the increase in the number of misdirected posts. At some point someone will realize that the sidebar mechanism is **not** a good way of informing new users.
3.4.10 will be the last release for 3.4 branch.
Great job! How did you explain the parenthesis and the quotation mark? It's actually pretty hard to explain other than "that's the rule"
This is a maintenance release with security fixes for 3.5 . Each release gets around 5 years of support.
Hi there, this post has been removed as it is not directly related to the Python programming language. It might be more topical on /r/programming, /r/coding, or /r/technology. Cheers, /r/Python mods
Hi there, from the /r/Python mods. We have removed this post as it is not suited to the /r/Python subreddit proper, however it should be very appropriate for our sister subreddit /r/LearnPython or for the r/Python discord: https://discord.gg/3Abzge7. The reason for the removal is that /r/Python is dedicated to discussion of Python news, projects, uses and debates. It is not designed to act as Q&amp;A or FAQ board. The regular community is not a fan of "how do I..." questions, so you will not get the best responses over here. On /r/LearnPython the community and the r/Python discord are actively expecting questions and are looking to help. You can expect far more understanding, encouraging and insightful responses over there. **No matter what level of question you have, if you are looking for help with Python, you should get good answers**. Make sure to check out the rules for both places. Warm regards, and best of luck with your Pythoneering!
Initial draft implementation which was spin out as a PEP after discussion : https://bugs.python.org/issue36144
I say the opposite. She started thinking out of the box from the get go. This will be my favorite thing to print out from now on instead of 'Hallo World'. 
Could you ask here if she minds I use here sentence "cows have eight legs" instead of "Hello World" from now on? 
&gt; At some point someone will realize that the sidebar mechanism is not a good way of informing new users. While this is true, unfortunately there are few to none other communication channels for &lt;new users&gt; without being bothersome to everybody.
That's exactly how I explained it to her - they are rules
Hello again, &amp;#x200B; I do really need some help on this, I couldn't find my answers anywhere else, please !
Unfortunately I do not have access to the data. The manual process is doable for a single year - even though this would be super time consuming. However, I do have access to over 10 years of sea ice charts. The images looks like [this](http://polarview.met.no/highres/svalbard_20190301.png)
lol. Well, she didn't copyright the sentence, so I guess you can use it. 
Yes, and 3.7 is out too. But some people can't upgrade yet.
This post is so useful. Thank you!

It says that he's working as an engineer, that would imply that it's likely to be independent work. Disclosure: I'm an engineer, I'm working on something I'd like to write a paper about, and there's no chance my employer would pay for mathematica just to make my life easier :)
I know, and that’s a deficiency of the site as a whole. There could and should be a tutorial process for new joiners, which might at the very least require them to acknowledge some or all points of the sidebar. Realistically there should be a graduated trust mechanism. Given what limited mechanisms the site does provide I think the quality is surprisingly high. And _most_ low quality posts aren’t intentionally so, they’re just people with questions they think are high priority trying to hit all the bases. One thing I’d love to see is a means of filtering identical items posted within a narrow frame to both r/python and r/learnpython as those will almost always be meant for the latter.
You only get that upvote because it is hilarious she said the computer is wrong for the 8 legs ;) &amp;#x200B; Ok and because you took the time to teach her \^\^
This is a lot of work. Thank you for sharing!
Definitely don't roll your own - you won't be able to, and even if you do, you won't be able to do it _securely_. Stripe is a good option if it accepts the payment options you care about.
You are a great aunt/uncle. 
That is true. If you're working on GR without access to Mathematica, then you could also check out [SageManifolds](https://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr/). It's quite impressive on what it can do, though for my day to day work I still prefer to work with Mathematica...
Hi mate! Thanks for the feedback. I'm a bit confused though (English is not my main language, my apologies). By "don't roll your own" you mean I shouldn't do my own payment backend? Because if that's the case, yes, I definitely wouldn't be able to . But since you are suggesting that Stripe is a good option, do you mean it's safe to use and I can implement it without worrying much about regulation and stuff? Again, really sorry if I'm interpreting you incorrectly. Thank you!
Yes, it's safe to use, and yes, you don't need to worry about regulation. Just make sure Stripe actually _works_ in your country, and they'll take care of the legal stuff for you (but only for processing payments - you're still responsible for the stuff you're selling!).
You should also check out [SageManifolds](https://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr/), it might be useful for your research.
Fortunately I'm not working on anything relativity related, just some fluid flow that doesn't need me to worry about Navier Stokes.
Thank you mate!! I'll look into that :) 
For paragraphs: # this is a bunch of text # blah blah blah and divide # by two # # Don't forget to carry the one. For major sections of a long function, I will sometimes put a line like this: ################################## It's pretty rare, since that's usually a sign that I'm actually writing more than one function and should break it up that way.
Great idea, and `dict` deserves an operator, since `list` and `set` types already have operators. As mentioned in [python ideas thread](https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-ideas/2015-February/031748.html) the obvious quirk would be on how to deal with key conflict and performance. I don't think Python has always followed the ""one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do things" zen strictly. If that was true, why do we have `list.append`, `list.extend` as well as operator and unpacking syntaxes? The same applies for `set`.
I kinda feel like the Python subreddits have got things the wrong way round. Newcomers are just going to search for "python" to post their questions so they end up here, only to get spammed with "omg go to r/learnpython" Makes more sense to me to have this be the newcomer-friendly channel, and have the more advanced stuff in another channel.

So she can read and write at 4?
Any chance for a git repo? :P
&gt; If that was true, why do we have list.append, list.extend as well as operator and unpacking syntaxes? Because practicality beats purity

I've always felt that `dict` is much closer to `set`. Therefore I'd have preferred the logical "set" operations defined on `set`, i.e. `and`, `or` etc. to be implemented.

Scratch is great. Yeah, it can be frustrating to manipulate blocks, but I'd rather do it with blocks than code any day. It also removes the challenge of typo's. I know c++, but I can just have fun quickly prototyping in scratch.

Git repo is [here](https://github.com/RexValkering/birthday-reminder-bot), though I will update it sometime this week.
I seriously can't understand you "inheritance" is there in the portion of Python. I really find no use of learning it.
Thanks for your thoughts :)
I feel like that is something you should know or use better (more descriptive) variable names
It's not a learn Python thing, it's a debate about software design and patterns.
How do better variable names help if they dont get used in the error message?
Append, and extend do completely different things, and aren't alternative ways of doing the same thing. I can't comment on the other things without a concrete example.
It's happened across all of the popular subeddits as reddit gains new types of user and changes its community.
You're a life saver! No longer will my family members be angry with me for forgetting something as trivial as a birthday :P 
I could read and write at 3. I was coding at 7. I’m a late bloomer I guess.
It says ‘Guido declares + over pipe’ at the first footnote. I am not very familiar with how decisions are made at psf but I thought Guido was on a permenant vacation from being the BDFL? I am just curious. 
Why does it bug you so much?
Nice, but you still need the actual path not the called path. A symlink pointing to your script will break that; you’ll find the symlink’s location not the script’s. 
If you had variables names that indicate what they were such as (number\_d or num\_dict) you would be able to distinguish what variables have the issues. 
I'm just imaging the girl going "Uncle I get SyntaxError: Missing parentheses in call to 'print'" uncle telling her it's because she's using python3, not python 2 "oooh I see `print("cow has eight legs")`"
When you think about it, it really is a missed opportunity. The standard for first program could have been so many awesome things, but instead it is "Hello world".
Now teach her assembly
I don't think so, tensor flow is a framework that was developed by Google. That's some next level shit 
Yeah but she can't count till ten yet, which is why she wrote the word "eight" instead of the number 8.
So great! Cannot wait to see what she comes up with in your next bedtime coding session!
This is a good question. Would love to hear from a python dev their thoughts on this. In the present design, Exceptions simple don't contain this information. Inside a function call, there is no knowledge of what labels are being used for the arguments or the function itself. Clearly, the information does exist. The question is, how hard would it be to capture it and make it available in the exception object.
I think there's a name for this effect. Each generation score higher on IQ tests than the previous one.
Yeah, last year at school i had to do a project on scratch for math (we don’t actually have programming in my school which I found to be something pretty shitty) so I joined two friends who new programming to do the project, and the result was that we ended up finishing the code at 4am before the day due, because of scratch’s fails at more complex levels, the code didn’t worked as intended most of the times but it did spontaneously at times. Pretty frustrating experience 
There's currently a post about a four year old writing a program. Why would anyone care about that?
The problem is that high quality posts about topics relevant to Python programmers are lost in the noise of low-effort posts, beginners' questions that should be in r/learnpython, and appeals for emotional support ("Help! Am I even smart enough to learn Python by Friday?"). Honestly it's just depressing. And the longer it continues the worse it gets, because it discourages participation from experienced programmers who look at the subreddit and conclude it isn't for them.

Reddit is getting very facebooky.
Check out PyTorch 
Thanks for the response and the links I'll have to check them out. 
Yes, children can learn to read and write by 4. Not well but letters making sounds that make words is a concept they grasp. That's why the cow had 8 legs. 
So your kid thinks cows have 8 legs but can spell perfectly? Jk that’s pretty cool though.
&gt;Yes So you know here too? Because I was asking whether she can read and write.
I don't think he meant that. He probably means that you as a dad introduced her to the awesome world of programming and that too with Python. Either that or I'm wrong. But I do feel she is lucky in having a dad like that. I discovered Python in final year of graduation. And it seemed like a godsend to me then, coming from a background of C++ and Java.
I think it's already awsome. It means you stepped to the another world. A world that will change how you think and who you are. 
Is this a circlejerk post
Isn't it because it's interpreted into machine code or something. Names of variables no longer exist at the point the code is ran and instead it is all pointers. Not saying it is impossible but not necessarily easy to implement. Especially when in the case OP describes simply splitting up the line would give clear indication.

I have nothing better to do. I'll learn how to do it with you. I'm already somewhat experienced with web scraping
To be honest I never thought of it like a hello to the new world of programming. That is probably how it was intended and it makes it quite a lot cooler.
Common Gateway Interface. Look up "python cgi" on google.

I use this for combining : d = {'spam': 1, 'eggs': 2, 'cheese': 3} e = {'cheese': 'cheddar', 'aardvark': 'Ethel'} combined = {**d, **e} &amp;#x200B;
Not sure when the pep was written but there is a "high council" in place for python finally. And Guido is one equal member.
I always thought of it as a birth 
I'm a fan of poetry, especially as it enables a scripts based workflow that allows me to mimick the frontend commands in the backend codebase i.e. `yarn run start` and `poetry run start`. This article describes how to do this.
She is his cousin daughter. What are you implying? 😈
Being able to type well at 4 is a valuable life skill even if she doesn't go into programming. I can't tell you how many kids at work have been absolutely floored by my ability to type faster than they can read (though they're all slow readers).
I wrote this tracer decorator to print the name of the incoming arguments. The information is there... ```python def tracer(func): """Print a trace of input and output of a function in one line.""" def traced_func(*args, **kwargs): result = func(*args, **kwargs) if len(args) is not 0: argslist = ", ".join(f"{x}" for x in args) if len(kwargs) is not 0: argslist = argslist + ", " if len(kwargs) is not 0 else "" else: argslist = "" if len(kwargs) is not 0: kwargslist = ", ".join([f"{k}={v}" for k, v in kwargs.items()]) else: kwargslist = "" print(f"{func.__name__}({argslist}{kwargslist}) = {result}") return result return traced_func ```
Sorry for the amount of downvotes you're getting! Hope you're feeling better now.
Seriously, though, the "computers are it says a cow has eight legs" notion is a concept that should be introduced to people learning computer science as early as possible.
Oh. Well then she's lucky to have a cousin like that.
Please tell me your username is Napoleon
&gt;She's going to grow up to be a PHP dev. Is abortion still an option?
The Flynn Effect. Generations keep scoring higher on IQ tests. Its not entirely clear why. Its actually be shown to be a bit more general. There are measurable generational changes in IQ tests almost without fail, sometimes positive and sometimes negative.
I teach MS computer science. I spend the first half of each semester drilling this into the students. "Computers are not smarter than you are. Computers are dumb. Computers make mistakes all the time because they aren't smart enough to think about the instructions they've been given." And every other variation I can think of for that message.

There used to be a rule that put a limit on how many posts you could put up about stuff you were doing. I got warned when I'd share blog posts I wrote about Python here, even though my volume was pretty low (I'm not that dedicated of a blogger). I'd say that back then, the volume was lower, but the posts were higher effort. However, I could see the danger in the sub dying because people were way less likely to promote someone else's stuff. Fewer posts lead to fewer reasons to come check out the sub. Personally, I'd like it if we had themed days or weekly pinned posts like you see in the crafting and TTRPG subs. It could help with keeping the community active, but also give people a place to put their low-effort stuff, like "my first program!" or "quick question about X". We might also consider a bot that tags EVERY post, like they have in r/knitting. It's just a quick reminder about certain rules (in their case, always post a link to the pattern you reference and what yarn you're using). In r/python's case, it could be a reminder about r/learnpython and the stickied posts. 
Yea I think it's called the Flynn effect. First heard of it on the podcast from Sam Harris with Charles Murray https://youtu.be/S6Rmbfi6YrE (Be aware of Ezra Klein though) :D

While the parsing you are doing can be simple enough, there is no simple way to compile python for client apps (frontend, that is), so you would need a server in flask or otherwise. If you want it to do it all client side you would likely need javascript for this (or any other language that transpiles well into it). If you really really want to do it serverless you could host this simple flask app as a lambda function on AWS for example; but personally I would prefer to do it on heroku or aws EC2 on the free tier.
Can we please get real moderation on this sub?
This doesn't print the names of variables: ``` @tracer def f(x): return x+1 x = 1 f(x) ``` prints: ``` f(1) = 2 ``` 
Names (like x, y, z) refer to values (like ints, strs, dicts, sets). During evaluation, the name is used to get the value. Then the operation is performed on the value. The value doesn't remember what name produced it. So when the exception happens, only the value is available, not the name. 
O-H.
My personal opinion is that kids are information sponges and should be taught something basic like python over things like scratch. Kids can comprehend much better than we give them credit for. Older people oddly enough are probably better off with scratch.
You are right. This is an older piece of code and I thought it would do it.
Probably because teaching becomes more advanced rather than children being some form of genetic mutation over generations.
I hate dragging blocks with a passion we had to do a project with them in the begining of my python class. I was kinda pissed like I spent my winter break learning the basics so I was prepared and then here drag these blocks on some shitty German website I dont remember the name of. Khan Academy is the best place to start imo. 
If you don't start coding at 6, it's basically impossible to stay competitive in this field. This kid has a good shot as long as she sticks with it.

This does not get the point. The error message can even show me the line of code where the error happened. Why does it not underline the exact operation or show the variable names after the error happend?
Well hopefully she turns out pretty at least. After I got put on adderol I was really self conscious about being dumb it really pushed me to learn as much as I could. Maybe she needs drugs that was the goto solution back in my day. worked for me but I think I just wanted to prove I didn't need them only took it for one year and then was an A B student forever after.
Here is a working solution: import re import traceback def get_input_names(function): def wrap(*args, **kw): stack = traceback.extract_stack() _, _, _, code = stack[-2] vars_name = re.compile(r"\((.*?)\).*$").search(code).groups()[0] print("variable name:", vars_name) result = function(*args, **kw) return result return wrap xxx = "foo" bla = "banana" @get_input_names def printerino(arg): print(arg) printerino(xxx) printerino(bla) &amp;#x200B;
Something would have to keep track of which variables (or arbitrarily complex expressions!) produced each value. How would that work? This line will get an error about adding a string to an int. What should be reported as the "name" of the string? ``` f.read().upper()[1:3] + 2 ```
`f.read().upper()[1:3]` because that is what makes the string.
She's right, computers are incredibly dumb. But they're also extremely obedient and dilligent: we don't love computers because of how much they know (nothing), we love them because of how good they are at following directions. You should consider doing the pbj exercise with her.
Yes, this is re-reading the source file (because that is how tracebacks get the source line, by re-reading the .py file after the exception happens) to get some of the information you want. But it doesn't work in lots of cases: ``` printerino( xxx ) ``` produces: ``` File "/tmp/red.py", line 9, in wrap vars_name = re.compile(r"\((.*?)\).*$").search(code).groups()[0] AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'groups' ``` And when it does work, it can only tell you the names of all the variables on the line. It can't figure out which variable name produced any result.
You could build a Python interpreter that worked this way. It would have to do a lot of bookkeeping to track expression text for each value, which would slow down execution. I suppose it could be an option you enable when debugging. I wonder how expensive it would be, and what edge cases it wouldn't be able to support?
Generally speaking, video game rendering can be offloaded to a GPU, while simulation logic can be done in multiprocessing. Ditto for spreadsheet tasks. That said, if you're married to Python and looking for performance, you may need to write C exts to get both of those things.
Agreed, this is something even CS postgrads sometimes struggle to come to grips with. 
Post the exact error you're getting.
Tell her I'm Jealous because I'm working my old brain to learn how to code and she is doing it and doing it well for fun. God bless and keep up the good work
They've been getting more popular in this sub unfortunately.
There is Snap! which is Scratch+Scheme tho.
I am actually. I had just gone through an incident in the real world before I posted the last message. Thanks for your kind wishes. :)
Just to clarify the Logitech G14 specifically isn't required, any Logitech device(including mice) can do this through their software. Corsair also has this except for the application specific part(:() I have the [K95 RGB](https://www.corsair.com/us/en/Categories/Products/Gaming-Keyboards/CORSAIR-Gaming-K95-RGB-Mechanical-Gaming-Keyboard-%E2%80%94-CHERRY%C2%AE-MX-Red/p/CH-9000220-NA) which has 18 macro keys. I end up using them almost entirely for games though.

Nice troll statement. You act as if it doesn't take 1 month to learn python.
She can actually read and write at 4? Smart kid :)
He probably left out how he had to help her a bit with spelling and such. My 4 year old does alright with spelling and reading basic words and can use a keyboard OK.

Just like cryptography was invented only to allow Bob to send a message to Alice.
That's discussed in the pep, and explained why it can be suboptimal (doesn't work for classes deriving from dict) 
And possibly due to teaching starting earlier, or at a quicker pace. This remembers me of [this page about baby reading](http://larrysanger.org/2010/12/baby-reading/), I stumbled upon it a couple weeks ago and found it an interesting reading.
Post the EXACT error message, start to end. Also, are you using Anaconda? Are you trying to `pip install` stuff into Anaconda? Because if so, don't.
whats the best alternative to php to create login systems and session based websites? I mean, when you consider facebook and twitter and major sites still use php, why all the digs on it?
How can you think of a 4YO and then imagine a life of PHP for that kid?

Who in their sane mind teaches programming to a 4 year old
lol. I was curious when someone would point that out. In truth I formed an old habit using the (+,-,-,-) signature but you can implement any signature you want since that information would be stored in the metric tensor.

At 4, kids are learning sight words like "the" "is" "and", plus their names. Words like "eight" aren't even on their (or their teachers') radar.
WOWWWWW SO COOOOL. I'm glad we can upvote your valuable post!!!
That's unclear. It says the requirement for geopandas is satified in the anaconda 3 folder. As usual it trying to install fiona to the normal path. "Appdata\local\temp\pip-install...\fiona". Goes to install fiona. Errors out "python setup.py egg info" "A GDAL version must be specificied. Provide a path to a GDAL config using a GDAL_Config environment variable or use GDAL_Version environment variable." I found another site that explained how to specify how to "build Fiona" and specify a GDAL config but it required other libraries and you guess it "setup.py egg_info..." I tried work around this using unroll and easy install because I found a forum that gave this as a general solution to the "setup.py egg_info" error. But it also throws the same error. *Note I keep seeing this error in different forms with other libraries. With unroll its "urllib.error.Httperror: http error 403: SSL is required". 
Yeah that's not the consensus at all. I've taught scratch and python to kids and scratch is great. Python even with it's small amount of syntax, has a higher learning curve. You act like typing code with kids is easy. They can hardly type. It's hard for them to hold shift then hit quotation marks and parentheses. Scratch works on iPads too. That being said if you try to make complex programs in scratch there is a syntax to the blocks in the way they click together. If you model it on the projector they learn pretty quickly.
sure, you’re right. happy cakeday!
porting a shell script to python again, a simple curl | xpath | wget thing accidentally, rewrites got me to hit the limits of functools.partial so I'm reading about https://mtomassoli.wordpress.com/2012/03/18/currying-in-python/
and it's not obvious enough to feel coherent with pythonicity
Python is text on a screen. Scratch is cartoons on a screen. Now which do you think you can get a child to focus on. This is like saying kids shouldn't play with Legos and should get right into an engineering textbook. The point is to teach kids to play around and let that spark an interest that you nurture. Switch them to Python as soon as you can, but hook them with scratch and Minecraft.
1. Forget about unroll, easy_install, and anything that's not pip or conda. 2. Start with an absolutely clean environment: remove EVERYTHING Python-related from your computer, then reinstall one specific thing - either Python from python.org, or Anaconda. 3. Run `pip install geopandas` (if you've installed official Python binaries) or `conda install geopandas` (if you've installed Anaconda). 4. Post the error here.
Screw you Python 3.4rc1!
That's about when I started, right after learning to read. I learned BASIC on a Tandy Color Computer II, mostly by copying programs from a book and changing bits to see what would happen. I only wish my parents had kept me provided with more computers and tools for learning, because I didn't really get back into programming until after high school.
Eh, I think my first program was this in GW-BASIC: 10 PRINT "The British are coming!" 20 GOTO 10 My high school computer science sort of laughed when she found out my Dad had taught me a language with line numbers and to use single letter variable names as a little kid.
I had my first computer at 8
&gt; easily discoverable That's great, a language designed to have "discovarable" syntax. That's why they say Python reads as pseudocode. And I see this completely as a positive thing. 
&gt;whats the best alternative to php to create login systems and session based websites? Literally anything else. &amp;#x200B; In all seriousness, PHP has come a long way but it has fundamental flaws. Facebook has essentially reinvented the language for their purposes because it was so bad when Zuck started. From the beginning, it was designed to die. PHP had (has?) no garbage collection or notion of long-running processes. The whole design was per-request, and your script and all its context died as soon as the request was served. That was fine in 1997. The syntax is similar to everyone's least favorite syntax, Perl. There are some great features of Perl, and plenty of languages that have borrowed ideas from it. The thing I have never liked about Perl is that if you give 12 Perl developers the same task, you will wind up with 13 different solutions. Most of them full of incomprehensible strings of sigils. But from a professional perspective (I have not been a professional web developer for the past several years, but this is my take from when I was): I have a STRONG preference for shipping the majority of the work to the client. Don't write websites, write Javascript applications that ship down to your client's browser and then call secure endpoints on your server. All they need to serve is JSON. The idea of a website where pages are static (or faux-static, in the case of PHP) HTML and CSS is antiquated. It's still fine for conveying ideas in text, of course.
No probs! Thanks for writing a cool book. I actually just finished reading the Clean Architecture book by Uncle Bob, and I don’t think I would have read it had I not gone through your book first :)
Agreed. Especially `&amp;` would be useful to do without having to say `a -= a - b`. Also, I would point out that the difference operator `-` already works the same way in sets as described for dictionaries.
Yeah, heard all that before. Done right it's fine. The OOP Alan Kay had in mind is just fine and works great.
Okay I'm gonna do it, will post when finished
Nah it’s trash. FP &gt; OOP any day, and don’t give me any of that FP+OOP hybrid worst of both worlds crap. You realize Alan Kay himself shits on modern OOP (i.e he isn’t going to be a fan of Python OOP either) in the link I posted?
I’m new to Python but I think I have 3.7 installed. Installed through Homebrew.
Even modern day OOP has it's benefits. Just cause so many people do such a shitty job of it doesn't mean it's bad. Hell, FP done the way most people attempt to is absolute shit as well. I know what Alan Kay was saying, hence the reason I said: &gt;The OOP Alan Kay **had in mind** is just fine 
The reason for the low quality is because there is no real community here. 
Modern day OOP is trash. Statically typed pure FP is fantastic. Even accounting for the questionable quality of a lot of developers they generally end up with something somewhat decent and maintainable when it’s pure statically typed FP. If you like the OOP Alan Kay had in mind that doesn’t mean you should be defending OOP in the context of Python, which is what you did in your first comment effectively. 
jupyter notebook could be used possibly 
Any `+` operation should be associative. If `a + b` isn't the same as `b + a` then your operation isn't analogous to addition. I don't think I'm just being pedantic - associativity is a core expectation of any addition operation, and I believe that violating that would lead to bugs and increased confusion from new Python programmers reading python code. This feels like adding a new 'gotcha' to the language to me.
Holy shit this blew my mind. I've never seen `**` syntax used outside of func params. Any other interesting use-cases for it?
I replied in the context of the broad sweeping "OOP is garbage" statement alone. As for your belief that a questionable developer can end up with something "somewhat decent and maintainable" in pure statically typed FP: I've rarely found a "questionable developer" that can even stumble through a pure statically typed FP language let alone make something useful. I don't disagree that pure statically typed FP lends itself to some of the best written code. Problem is (and why it isn't used or taught as a defacto standard) that more developers struggle with it to the point of it rarely being used compared to other paradigms. Besides, someone who needs to ask that question is probably barely skirting a tenuous grasp on organizing and structuring their code to begin with. Pure FP is nearly impossible to achieve in python. So, rather than allowing OP to simply "make up some structure" built of random functions in random files, I suggest he should stick to something that has well documented methods available. I wouldn't argue anything about an OOP+FP hybrid aside from that a good FP programmer can build a maintainable OOP system. Hell, any good developer can. Unfortunately good developers are rare these days.
Do they need to install Jupyter? How long would that take? Ideally I was looking for 0 downtime (installation etc), and still have access to the 3 packages specified in the OP but if that isn't possible is Jupyter my best bet?
You're fine. This is largely for large corps that standardize on specific releases and distros that do the same. Homebrew is going to be latest stable, good to learn on.

Doesn't it naturally get rid of `i` in wave equations? 
I like it, but I think I would like the ability to to skip mutation of specific funtions. E.g. os.path.join(foo, "bar") Because I always handle it in code if the target doesn't exist. Ignoring functions at the class or module or project level would be brilliant. Similarly but less important I guess specific args or kwargs. But even without this I already found a few things to improve, good stuff!
Worse, the video URLs are going to be all kinds of places, with no consistent API.
Generally speaking, while this may be true in theory, no-one has managed to make Python work fast enough for a AAA game.
I always expect my strings to sort themselves when concatenating them, so frustrating! /s &gt;&gt;&gt; 'a' + 'b' == 'b' + 'a' False
`2**0.5=sqrt(2)`
Yes, \`extractfile\` does what you want. 
Definitely true, and it kind of drives my point home about straight-up Python being the wrong tool for performance-sensitive simulation work (even more so than "faster" languages).
Not sure the current state, but a few years or more, /r/fitness was like this. People come in, ask the FAQ stuff, everyone loses their minds. The catch was, it was good, because then the new people would stay out of the specific subs. It would be analagous to having /r/PyML, letting the useless questions/posts in here, but if you were serious about learning/talking ML, you'd go there (and even be referred there if you had a real question). Conversely, if someone went to /r/PyML, asked "so, uh, can someone help me understand why $FAQ is happening?", you'd see it more acceptable to have phasers to full blast.
That's not the same operator 
I think you mean *commutative* ? As far as I can see the proposal would actually be *associative*. Also, note that string addition is not commutative either, and surely that's a natural way to express the concatenation of two strings?
You can use repl.it (google 'repl.it python'). Just use an import statement and their interpreter will automatically install the package.

 server.sendmail('sender', 'receiver', "message") &amp;#x200B; You're not sending an email under sender, receiver?
&gt;logger.basicConfig(format=format, file=fname) 1. Above line is not possible because, logger does not have the 'basicConfig' method to set the format and filename. So, it wont work, at least to my knowledge. Correct me if I am wrong. Also, \`logging\` object does not have a \`addHandler()\` method, therefore, FileHandler()and Formatter() cant be used on the root logger. So that statement I made about \`FileHandler()\` and \`Formatter()\` holds true. 2. Well, my example is too simplistic and is repeating the same message Python would've said. So, yeah I see your point.

Addition isn't always commutative. String concatenation is one example of where the syntax is used. Multiplication being non-commutative is the norm for matrices. Though, python sets have - but not +. It does hold some merit to make them have the same ops, but here it's maybe adding + to sets as well (with the same caveat). 
you asked for `**` syntax :P
Clarified, for the daft

Great thread! I'm the PyCharm Developer Advocate, love seeing folks share such tips. FWIW, we've been quietly working on a system that gives gives first-class treatment to tips (and other resources.) For example, here's a [playlist of tips related to the Navigation Bar](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/guide/playlists/navigation-bar/) This is really the first public mention, though we've been tweeting these for a couple of months. I'm interested in feedback: what kinds of tips, what else in this "expanded tip" idea we could do, etc. This is in a public repo, done in GatsbyJS (long story), and ultimately we'd love other authors and reviewers.
useful, but use with caution. I did this on a large codebase that I was new to and the code was using lazy imports. the code imported something, initialized it, then imported something else later in the file that required the previous initialization. the lazy import got hoisted up top with everything and I went about my business. ended up causing problems later. really bad design, but just sharing in case that happens to bite anyone 
I don't think html and css are antiquated, it's the best way to dynamically make your website function like an app and resize to any device screen size and still be relevant and readable. I feel like that visual framework isn't going anywhere no matter what websites your building, then it's just a matter of how you handle server-side functions.
I agree of course. If you're building a website for any sizeable amount of traffic today, you're probably using a CSS and JS framework.
You should only have to catch it on the outer layer
 {'x': 1, 'y': 2} | {'x': 3} Um...
That´s cool waiting for the tird part!
Make it simple, not simpler.
So to recap, using JS and JSON to send information to and from your server can entirely replace the functionality of PHP? Like say I want to build a login system where user XYZ logs in, a session is created, and now his version of the website, his preferences and the options he has access to are different from user ABC. PHP was built for this and allows it to be done in a hidden way where you can't peer into the source code, you can call on php pages with functions and server connections that aren't public facing. Can Javascript with JSON accomplish that without being a convoluted mess?
Yes! 
Thanks! 
I-O
Thanks, How do I make that approach specific enough.? eg if the view has a try/except for some form which pulls in an api, won't it just look that the form failed rather than the request to the api and I won't see what the return error was or the payload that caused it.
You're not really understanding what I wrote. Your endpoint could be written in PHP in the above scenario. The point is, PHP wouldn't be rendering any HTML. Or it could if you want. But that loses the benefit of separating your business logic from your display code. It would be better to write the endpoint in something faster. Modern systems architecture involves microservices. If you want to build a web application to scale, you don't write it to be monolothic.
Nope 
Is that what you think should happen? If so I disagree. Values should be replaced, not magically mutated.
Not to hijack this post, but I've made what I believe to be a pretty nice text editor with Python and Tkinter. See [Codingg](https://github.com/Aareon/Codingg)
You might check out Python Anywhere and have them run it in their browser. Not sure about pygame support though.
The PEP mentions performance concerns with code like `d1 + d2 + d3 + d4`. Is that because per the example pure Python implementation it would be recreating a bunch of `dict`s with each call to `__add__`? I imagine it wouldn't be too hard to add an optimization in C that checks for situations like this and optimizes it into that loop.
In example 1: &gt;&gt;&gt; d = {'spam': 1, 'eggs': 2, 'cheese': 3} &gt;&gt;&gt; e = {'cheese': 'cheddar', 'aardvark': 'Ethel'} &gt;&gt;&gt; d + e {'spam': 1, 'eggs': 2, 'cheese': 'cheddar', 'aardvark': 'Ethel'} &gt;&gt;&gt; e + d {'cheese': 3, 'aardvark': 'Ethel', 'spam': 1, 'eggs': 2} It's not obvious to me that 3 + 'cheddar' = 'cheddar'. That seems more likely to cause confusion than anything else. 
You have to install the library before being able to import it. pip install pygame probably... 
No. I was just pointing out you shouldn't use set logic on dict.
Sets and dictionaries are both hash tables, but the use cases are different and the implementations are different (have a look at the introductory comment in `Objects/setobject.c` for a brief overview). And after reading [the linked email about choice of operator](https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-ideas/2019-February/055519.html), I'm inclined to agree that `+` is the right choice of operator -- the argument about symmetric versus asymmetric is the clincher for me.
Awesome, Thank you! :D 
No problem at all! Thanks for sharing :) 
There was a book published on O'Reilly that *really* helped. I'll see if I can't find it and update my comment. I think it would be super beneficial to anyone that is also interested in your series. 
I gotta agree - there's no unifying force or thing that holds the sub together or that the sub focuses on; it's a very broad topic where everyone has their own interests and such.

This is discussed and examples given in the pep of why this isn't as clear as you make it out to seem. While I agree that it's closer to set in a sense, syntax is way more important and it would make no sense to stray from Counters.
There is a ticket in the issue tracker discussing various approaches to whitelisting beyond the pragma lines we support today. I'd love for you to read and give your opinion there! It helps getting a few different real world situations to test your ideas against. 
This is wholly unclear from your example alone.
can you explain what do you mean by building your selenium framework exactly? i know selenium is a framework by itself so what did you mean.. 
Oh, and how was the first use experoencw? Did it work with just pip install and then run?
Also to add... I'm fairly certain if Guido likes something it's got to count for something...
Updated my post. Thanks for being a good sport, btw. Ill be sure to watch your series and if I have any suggestions or questions, I'll either hit you up here or in the video comments. Do you by chance have a repository to accompany this series? 
Is this why every sarcastic comment need to be followed by /s? /s
You need to try googling it. Your actual questions produces lots of working results. We don't need to do your work for you.
&gt; adding a new 'gotcha' to the language Well... &gt;&gt;&gt; a = 'foo' &gt;&gt;&gt; b = 'bar' &gt;&gt;&gt; (a + b) == (b + a) False &gt;&gt;&gt; c = [1, 2] &gt;&gt;&gt; d = [3, 4] &gt;&gt;&gt; (c + d) == (d + c) False That ship has sailed :) The Python language reference defines `+` to be addition for numeric types, and concatenation for sequence types. And user-defined classes are free to make use of any semantics the author desires.
[From the Python 3.7 documetnation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/smtplib.html#smtplib.SMTP.sendmail): &gt; **Note** The *from_addr* and *to_addrs* parameters are used to construct the message envelope used by the transport agents. sendmail does not modify the message headers in any way. My guess is that your message does not actually contain a "FROM:" header line. Be sure to set all the message headers you need to in your message (e.g. Subject, From, To, etc)
Thanks, This is really useful!
Try matching your delimiters and see if it runs
Also fix typos, in programming the spellings need to be exact
didn't get you?
Yeah here is the updated version :https://dpaste.de/myOR 
[removed]
As for delimiters do you explaining 
Common tools and functions to use within the company's architecture
Agreed. I like the '-' operation but '+' seems counterintuitive to me
What was here? I want to see too!
3.7 is where it's at.
is it a global trend on reddit ?
- F11 to bookmark lines and Shift + F11 to switch between them - follow the stack trace, Neo. - External tools with macros - run actions on selected directories/files/lines - Run dashboard - I don't need the CI, just kidding) - Tasks&amp;Contexts - if you work on more than one issue at once
My gut tells me this won't be accepted. What would happen if you don't have numbers but strings or other things as values? Is it going to add them too? Is it going to be javascript? Okay, with that last one I'm just joking ;-)
The subreddit owners would most likely not want to do that, but I think that they should at least put "go to r/learnpython for asking and answering questions" in the description under the subreddit name, this would help a lot of people from posting on the wrong subreddit.
have u solved it? what was the issue
Working on a program that checks for job openings, pulls government job openings through public APIs, parses the data, then exports it as a .csv into a google drive folder. &amp;#x200B; Doing this so I have to spend less time finding employment opportunities for my case management job. Might even turn this into an app.
I would like to see the operator "-" implemented in list too. 
It's because `'cheese'` appears in both dictionaries, and `update` takes the second value so `d + e` should too. `e + d` would have `'cheese': 3`. It doesn't add pairwise; none of the built-in sequences do. `e + d` is something like: x = d.copy() x.update(e) return x Just like for lists, `a + b` is x = a.copy() x.extend(b) return x
Using `+` to denote `upsert` is not intuitive.
Who else is on the steering committee? I think that's the term they're using.
can you give more practical examples even with randomize/general names.. just ton have better grasp on what do you mean exactly in reality..
Yeah, but you show them scratch and nothing will happen when they actually have to... you know, program. Scratch isn't going to teach actual programming, so when you sit them down to learn python they will be just as lost as when they started.
None of the sequences in Python add things element-wise. Do you expect `[1, 2, 3] + [2, 3, 4]` to be `[3, 5, 7]`? Do you expect `'abc' + '123'` to be `'\x92\x94\x96'`? No, so why would you expect `{'a': 1, 'b': 2}` + `{'b': 3, 'c': 0}` to be `{'a': 1, 'b': 5, 'c': 0}`? Also if you need different behavior, such as with the `Counter` class, you can subclass dictionary and overload `update` and `+=` to do element-wise operations.
Ah, it was a social experiment
It's "copy and merge", not "upsert", exactly like it works already for lists. I think it's consistent.
I get what it's doing; my point is that it's not the natural way&amp;mdash;at least not the *only* natural way&amp;mdash;to read the syntax. It's not what I would assume would happen, which strikes me as an unpythonic design choice.
Wish you good luck! What library are you using? And why are you using an RNN model? Afaik, RNNs aren't suitable for this task, CNNs though would be more suitable.
Thanks fr the advice friend. Just wondering, do you have any experience with repl.it? It installed and used numpy just fine, but won't work with matplotlib in my scripts. As a simple example from matplotlib documentation, are you able to get it to run this &amp; produce a plot for it on repl.it? &gt; import matplotlib.pyplot as plt &gt;plt.plot([1, 2, 3, 4]) &gt;plt.ylabel('some numbers') &gt;plt.show() Thanks again for your help.
Disappointed this isn't at the top. Even if you don't know the shortcut, you still get easy keyboard access to literally everything.
what do you mean by .similar(0.XX)? &amp;#x200B; also what's the purpose of the program 
for Pythonistas making the switch to PyCharm, [here's](https://kite.com/blog/python/pycharm) a guide to getting set up on Mac and Windows
No. `list1 + list2` never remove data. `dict1 + dict2` can. This is actually the first time in Python that `+` could be destructive if this PEP is accepted.
You might like double-shift for "Search Everywhere". You can navigate to files, open menus, but also execute actions. So double-shift, type "form" and "format code" will be somewhere near the top.
Thanks! I'm using TensorFlow now because things were getting a little too hairy for NumPy/ SciPy alone. And yes you are right. I'm using a CNN. My brain must have broken for a second when I typed the comment above.
Runs fine for me.
For some reason, I'm annoyed shitless by KPX. It shows me shortcuts which I know I cannot remember, usually in the middle of me in coding mode rather than learning/thinking mode. But I grant you that to many, it's very helpful. I've made it part of my team's standard Jetbrains setup. 
I only regret that I have but one like to give for this pun. :)
I think you're forgetting numbers. The + operator had been discarding data for hundreds of years. Besides, nobody uses + because they want an operator that doesn't discard data; they use it because they expect the operands to have specific types and they want to perform a specific operation on them.
Personally, I would recommend starting with sth simple, Vanilla/fully connected/dense neural networks will be perfect. Also don't use a library till you have a grasp of the basic concepts (neurons, feedforward, backprobagation) and a intuition on what is happening when a dense network is learning (it's suprisingly simple). Next, learn about CNNs, RNNs, from these two you can learn other types/archeticture. You don't need to know how to implement CNNs and RNNs, but I highly advice you to implement a dense network. Finally, pick a library and experiment with it. Seriously, learning a library isn't hard at all, and many people know how to use two libraries. I recommend pytorch or keras.
But `3 + 'cheddar'` (should) never be read to happen. None of the other builtin collections in Python add element-wise. Pulling from another comment of mine: Do you expect `[1, 2, 3] + [2, 3, 4]` to be `[3, 5, 7]`? Do you expect `'abc' + '123'` to be `'\x92\x94\x96'`? No, so why would you expect `{'a': 1, 'b': 2}` + `{'b': 3, 'c': 0}` to be `{'a': 1, 'b': 5, 'c': 0}`? The idea is that if `+` means `extend` for lists, and there is no simple way to copy and `update` a dict, then let `+` mean `update` for dicts.
I think you've read the pep wrong. There's a python implementation in the pep. The `+` operator creates a *new* dictionary and merges both dictionaries into that new dict, it doesn't modify in place.

Meh, they should fix that too. Using &amp;&amp; and || for sets isn't intuitive either. They should have just used + and -

&gt; ctrl alt shift c &gt; alt j Those are great, I didn't know about them. Normally I go through with alt-click for multiple-select but a lot of the time alt-j sounds so much easier.
&gt;I think you're forgetting numbers. The + operator has been discarding data for hundreds of years. Wrong. 1+3=4 The 1 and 3 is not gone. You can't change any one of them without affecting result. {'x': 1} + {'x': 3} = {'x': 3} {'x': 1} is gone. You could have used {'x': 9999} for all we know. &gt;Besides, nobody uses + because they want an operator that doesn't discard data; they use it because they expect the operands to have specific types and they want to perform a specific operation on them. So you think any operator can be used?

I don't like how the difference operator is defined. Without reading the reference implemention, it's not clear whether `{'x': 1} - {'x': 2}` should be `{'x': 1}` or `{}`. ISTM subtracting a list or set from a dict should remove the specified keys, but subtracting a dict should only remove keys with matching values.
It's as pythonic as `update` already is. It's not really introducing new behavior. It's basically just syntactic sugar for what many projects are already doing (I.e. chaining dict updates). 
is there a hub of technical discussion?
Yes, it doesn't modify in place, but during the process of merging it **discards** the duplicated data in first dict.
Meh. I use ctrl+shift+F and ctrl+shift+N *far* more than shift+shift. It's too slow on huge projects IMO.
Only in the merged dict. The original dict is the same, nothing gets discarded from it
Technically it's not an operator, just a token that's used in analogous ways in a bunch of special cases.
Seeing how qt is increasing in relevance for python, it would be nice to see something similar with pyside2.
Why they are still releasing newer versions of python2?
It's only been around for a few years, hence the lack of widespread usage. It's also not a frequently used operation. I've needed it only a handful of times in my fifteen years of Python development.
Yes I know. Data is discarded in the merged dict. I am not talking about that data is forever lost. I am saying `+` operation should not discard data.
That would be an O(n²) operation, though, and people expect operators to be O(n) at worst.
Here's my advice, read as much code as you can, and write even more. There's plenty of blog posts that walk you through different projects of various difficulities, google them, read, write and modify them. Some knowledge of data structures and algorithms would be helpful here. Most people when writing a project blog won't go into details about the data structures they use, just google them when you come across any.
You mean column select?
Extend can be substituted with the `+=` operator for lists. a = [1, 2] a += [3, 4] # same as a.extend([3, 4]) Append can be substituted with an unpacking syntax: a = [1, 2] a = [*a, 3] # same as a.append(3) Of course the performance can be different, but the end result is the same.
*Hewwo sushi drake!* It's your **3rd Cakeday** omento! ^(hug)
Awesome, I will do that! I’m currently making my way through Automate The Boring Stuff, but I will keep this in mind for on the side or afterwards. Thanks!
Minor bug fixes that are pushed to the 2.7 tree. Next Jan that is finished. That is what is meant by extended maintenance.
You can just pass a function as an object. 
Definitely understandable. I don't know if I've really worked on anything big enough where it's been an issue, I'm sure that once I do I'd start using the designated shortcuts. As is I just double shift and tab to the correct category.
Thanks for your suggestion! :) 
I agree with you. What is being proposed here are operations like `union` and `difference` of sets and not arithmetic addition and subtracton. However both set operations and arithmetic operations are commutative, but with `dict` it won't be. Still, the use of `|` instead of `+` would be more logical.
I'm quite surprised by the fact that `a += b` would not be equivalent to `a = a + b`. According to this PEP, the in-place operator would also work with `b` being a list of tuples. Is there any other built-in type which differentiates += operator like this? Also, that implies I would no longer be able to infer the type of `a` while reading `a += [("foo", "bar")]. Is it a list? A dict?
Ok cool. Thanks for letting me know.

Same if you add two lists! 
Could get it to be O(n+m) by converting the subtrahend to a set. But then there are space implications, so I don't know. I definitely wouldn't want it as an operator, but methods analogous to `extend` for difference and intersection would be nice. Or a standard library ordered set which has these features.

lol, well I guess it depends on what you mean by "decent looking" :D I get what you mean, and in fact tkinter does not provide the coolest setup by default (it's actually pretty old), but, keep in mind that I am developing on Linux Manjaro XFCE
Oh nice, I've been using dict(some_dict, edit=value) to create copies of dictionaries with some change on them.
&gt; The 1 and 3 is not gone. You can't change any one of them without affecting result. I wasn't talking about mutability. No + operator in Python mutates its arguments. I mean when you add an m-bit number to an n-bit number, the result generally has fewer than m+n bits, so data is discarded in the same sense that the new + operator for dicts discards data. &gt; {'x': 1} is gone. You could have used {'x': 9999} and it won't change the result. It's not gone; you just don't have a name for it anymore. If you had saved it in a variable you could still access it. The only difference with numbers is that every number has a "name" (i.e. the literal syntax) even when it's not assigned to a variable. &gt; So you think any operator can be used? Ideally you'd want to pick an operator where the new meaning has a fairly obvious connection to the traditional meaning, but in principle, yes.
Look here - first you provide an example with no context. Whether or not it's a good or bad example of the pipe is without a doubt unclear (why you got a comment thereafter about it). Then you reply saying it should have been obvious and then you reply again to me that you're being sarcastic. You need serious help with clarity and then some. Including how to properly convey sarcasm.
&gt; contents of the list to be hashable ***whoops*** Yeah that's a problem.
Made some fixes to my twitch chatbot and I'm currently working on a CLI utility for opening web browser bookmarks from the shell. 
This is how dictionaries work. When you set the same key to a new value the original value is discarded. &amp;#x200B; Currently you can do: `d = {'stuff': 1234, 'more_stuff': 'i like nachos'}` `e = {**d, 'stuff': '5678'}` &amp;#x200B; result: `{'stuff': '5678', 'more_stuff': 'i like nachos'}` &amp;#x200B; The data in the original dict is no longer included in the new dict. As others have pointed out, it isn't lost. It still exists in 'd'. 'e' is an entirely new dict formed using 'd' as a base.
How is the data forever lost if the original variable remains unchanged ?

Then what do you expect it to do to conflicting keys? Essentially we have two dict concatenated, group by key, and then an aggregate is done to its values. + being right value agg and - being left value agg
I really should start incorporating tests into my projects. I find it hard sometimes to balance actual development of features and creating tests for bugs that I find during development. I think its mostly because the bugs that I do find are flaws in logic and not knowing libraries well enough to produce the proper result the first time, rather than dealing with bugs that pop up frequently. 
I disagree. If I have the following: a = [1, 2] b = [3, 4] (a + b) == (b + a) ...then I expect the expression to evaluate to `False`, and I think most would agree that it's the most intuitive result.
&gt;It's not gone; you just don't have a name for it anymore. If you had saved it in a variable you could still access it. The only difference with numbers is that every number has a "name" (i.e. the literal syntax) even when it's not assigned to a variable. Sigh. Everyone thinks I am talking about data being mutated in place or data is forever lost. It is not exactly upsert because it upserts on a copy, not the original data. But it is the same concept. `+` should not mean `upsert`. Of course there is information loss. But in this case, the information of one operand is gone. Let me repeat my examples again because you failed to see the difference. The 1 and 3 is not gone. You can't change any one of them without affecting result. {'x': 1} is gone. You could have used {'x': 9999} and it won't change the result. &gt;Ideally you'd want to pick an operator where the new meaning has a fairly obvious connection to the traditional meaning, but in principle, yes. As I said above, `+` should not mean `upsert`.
&gt;addition for numeric types, and concatenation for sequence types But dicts are neither of those (even in Python 3.7 where dicts keep insertion order). &gt;&gt;&gt; isinstance(dict(), collections.abc.Sequence) False

I would add that this is not really a "gotcha". I think for concatenation with strings and lists, the fact that `(a + b) != (b + a)` is intuitive.
I used OpenCV to get the images from the webcam and processed everything else in Pygame. I used Pyautogui for the key presses. Source here: https://pastebin.com/Zpnfu5TP It only uses 1.5% of my CPU (it's an Intel i5-8600K). I made it because I needed some way to use press to talk during gamedev livestreams. Both hands are used and moving between different locations when I'm making games, so I couldn't just have a press to talk hotkey. That's why I made a button for my foot. xD
Nice chart, very clean!
I don't think /u/netok saying data is *forever* lost, but that the result is missing information about one of the operands. With concatenation, the result contains *all* elements from the operands Granted, the result loses the lengths of the two operands, but /u/netok is overlooking that. Ex one can get `[1, 2, 3]` from both `[1] + [2, 3]` and from `[1, 2] + [3]`. This is information loss. For that matter, /u/netok says that integer addition does not destroy information, but it does. In a similar way to concatenation, one can get `5` from both `2 + 3` or `1 + 4`, or (in theory) infinitely many other sums. Regardless of how you look at it, you cant deduce both operands given the result. There is also information loss in a lot of other places in the standard library which they are overlooking. `set`, `collections.Counter`, class mixins/multiple inheritance. Giving an operator to `update`, a very common dict operation, is not an unreasonable thing to do. 
I think update is a more apt description of what happens than `+`.
No, you’re talking about procedural programming. There are many other programming paradigms, like functional programming, or Logic programming. Each language is part of one (or two) paradigm. Try functionnal programming ! It’s like Ocaml, Lisp, F#, Scala ! It’s a beautiful way to code ! Give it a try !
This is really cool.
In Python 3, it's `2 ** (3/4)`. In Python 2, it's `download and use Python 3`.
This already occurs for `dict.update`, so this behavior is expected. `+` is just a shorthand for `dict.copy` and `dict.update` pretty much.
Ehhhhhh, I don't think it's quite right to say that it's an odd interpretation to think of it element-wise. The operation *is* element-wise, it's just element-wise replace, not add (which is what plus usually means). I should clarify that the problem, from my perspective, is not that it's hard to figure out what's going on from the docs, or when you're explicitly thinking about it. The problem will be for new programmers, polyglots, and folks who don't have to use this kind of functionality much but come across it in code. Especially if those people use, say, numpy or pandas, where adding means adding. 
Please, be my guest! Tell me what do you think when you're done reading, any thoughts or criticism too. Hope you enjoy it!
Ooh deep. Very interesting, thank you!
I have no problem with this operation. The problem I have with it is that `+` should not be used for it. Since there is no appropriate operator, I think they should drop it.
I originally wrote this in Matlab [https://github.com/spacetimeengineer/legacy-spacetime-toolkit](https://github.com/spacetimeengineer/legacy-spacetime-toolkit) but my license ran out so I decided to try something free. To answer your question, I do agree with you that Maple or Mathematica is better for certain things which the spacetimeengine package aims to solve but maple and Mathematica will always be less integratabtle than Sympy. With python, it is easier to integrate and find contributors. There is a stronger user base and there are more interesting libraries in python to connect with. Also I would prefer the oversight of more engineers and less academics because best practices are taken very seriously in python. I feel that Maple and Mathematica were built for academics and less-so for engineers. Lastly, as a physicist and an engineer I have come to experience in my career that mathematicians/physicists don't talk to engineers nearly enough and they should. Cooler things would be built if they did. There is too much of a gap between engineering and science and it is my belief that writing code in Python bridges that gap in the long run however I would love to hear the communities opinion on these topics.
Youre welcome
If you use Python 3, they'll all give the same result.
What the hell is this and what does it have to do with python?
&gt; If you look at how the + operator is used in digital circuit design (to represent a logical "or"), the analogy is even closer, because x + 1 = 1 + y = 1 for any x and y. I dont think its usage in digital circuit design should apply here. Most python programmers wont know about it.
Are you going to implement intellisense too?

My whole life is a collection of if statements and loops.
I do agree that python is more integrateable and has a larger user base. I would love to do all my work in python (or any open source solution), but its symbolic algebra/calculus is just not comparable to Mathematica/Maple. &gt; Lastly, as a physicist and an engineer I have come to experience in my career that mathematicians/physicists don't talk to engineers nearly enough and they should. Cooler things would be built if they did. There is too much of a gap between engineering and science and it is my belief that writing code in Python bridges that gap in the long run however I would love to hear the communities opinion on these topics. I cannot speak for other communities, but in my field (gravitational wave physics) the cooperation between engineers, experimental and theoretical physicists lead to one of the greatest experiments in human history - the LIGO detectors :). 
&gt;I am not very familiar with how decisions are made at psf but I thought Guido was on a permenant vacation from being the BDFL? The idea was bought up by someone on the Python ideas mailing list, most people we're positive to the change. One of the core devs was willing to sponsor the issue and get a PEP written (and here we are). Guido messaged on the mailing list that he liked the idea, tbh it's the first time I've seen him message on Python ideas in a while but I don't keep track that much.
You can read [my response here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/ax4zzb/pep_584_add_and_operators_to_the_builtin_dict/ehsbole/) as you have misunderstanding like others.
Well, thats not really that much at all. My opinion, just use an AWS instance tuned to the amount of ram you need. It sounds like you don't really need that much. No point in buying hardware if you aren't able to accurately predict what you need, when you can just rent what you need for cents on the dollar. 
Good point! I guess my only point is that there could be more great experiments if we could bridge that divide better. 
Nope. Maybe later on, if the video is successful, I could improve it with features as such!
Debuggers let you examine variables' values, but that is different than identifying values by their variable names when an error occurs.

In mathematics, the operators are union, intersection, and set difference. How does that map to + and -?

Hi pymike , glad to see you on Reddit! Keep doing your good work. Ti stimo 
 Yeah i'm a marketing student. this isn't my forte 
&gt;Currently you can do: e = {**d, 'stuff': '5678'} This is not a common use as [pointed out by Guido](https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-ideas/2019-February/055535.html) thus should not be used as example here. &gt;The data in the original dict is no longer included in the new dict. As others have pointed out, it isn't lost. It still exists in 'd'. 'e' is an entirely new dict formed using 'd' as a base. [Responded here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/ax4zzb/pep_584_add_and_operators_to_the_builtin_dict/ehsbole/)
For Python 2, add a line at the top of your file that reads &amp;#x200B; from \_\_future\_\_ import division &amp;#x200B; and you will get the right answer. &amp;#x200B;
Really, the only one they need to fix is `+`, which should just make to Union
Python 2 is going away. I get that, but that doesn't make a statement like that at all useful. Yes, you should migrate to Python3, but you have the environment you have, and often can't change it for reasons outside the scope of a one liner. An an example, I have production code on Python 2.7 that's not going away anytime soon, and I'm taking a course which, because the course itself is going away at the end of the semester, is not being migrated. (The course uses Python incidentally, it's not a Python course per se.) Please try to remember the human,
I understand there are environments where it isn't possible to migrate. That was the case at my last job. If you absolutely can't switch to Python 3, then the best way to resolve the OP's issue is to add `from __future__ import division`.
Hi Nicola, thank you so much for your support!!! :D 
1. /r/learnpython 2. There's all sorts of lists of beginner project ideas a short google away.
It's too late to change sets.
Figuring out how to use tkinter is a Lovecraftian fever dream. There are a bunch of different versions with extremely different interfaces and it's nearly impossible to tell up front what version a googled document refers to. Deploying it is a pain; it's not just a pip install and is much more a satanic ritual. The interface itself is extremely unpythonic, so judicious guessing or repl experimentation is useless.
`+` means add, not update. This behavior should not be expected.
But it doesn't make logical sense to "add" two dicts together. They're not sequences in the way lists or tuples are. And yet there also isn't a "merge" or "update" operator that fits; `|` doesn't really work here for a lot of reasons. `+` is the closest conceptual operator out of all of the existing Python operators, even if it's not addition.
Thank you!
I had already read that comment, this is why I left this one clarifying what I gathered to be your position. I understand you aren't talking about any permanent loss - I think we all here know that operators such as `+` never modify either operand and so cannot truly "destroy" information. But the fact is that not all information about ***both*** operands is contained in the result. With concatenation you lose length - thus there are multiple sets of operands which produce the same result. Which of these are the actual operands is the missing information. The fact that the proposed dict operator loses *more* information than concatenation or addition is not unprecedented for the `+` operator in Python, so I don't really understand what your opposition really is.
If statements and loops are too reductive, because you also need to produce side effects (writing to disk, outputting to the screen, maintaining a counter, operating on user input). What you can say with more accuracy is that programming languages are all UIs on top of a [Turing machine](https://youtu.be/dNRDvLACg5Q).
If you want a deal, sign up on a freelancer website and post a job. 
I could not agree more. My problem was not with anything you said, but with the wording you chose to express it. It's unfortunate, but universities also move very slowly and often present some of the same challenges as you see in enterprise environments. A look at the scale, of course, quickly explains why. Have a great day. 
Sounds good! :D 
I mean one can say the same thing about concatenation. `+` means add, not concat. This (`'abc' + '123' == 'abc123') behavior should not be expected. If your response is that "but there is precedence for `+` to mean concat" then I would point you to the example mentioned in the PEP. `collections.Counter` has `+` mean `update`. I'd say that `+` and `|` are the only two real contenders for this operation, and because Python has precedence for `+` the PEP proposes to use that.
&gt; Mathematica is just so far ahead I'm interested to know more about this. I assume this is a broad and well-known subject, but for my edification can you summarize the ways in which mathematica and maple are better than sympy/sage? Appreciated. 
Stack overflow!
?
&gt; I'm in a coding class Maybe you shouldn't have taken a fucking coding class then. 
perfect thank you!
I wouldn't have taken it if it wasn't REQUIRED 
Maybe you're not cut out for that degree, then. Because if it's a "very simple project" then you should be able to do it yourself. And if you can't, then you're gonna be an absolute shitshow in a semester or two.
I think it's an operator. It's the mapping unpacking operator.
dude, its literally in place of a language. calm yourself. 
Do your own work. 
I actually don't use Maple, only Mathematica. I tried SageMath a few years ago, and at the end decided to go back to Mathematica, for multiple reasons: - For me it was just more intuitive to use in general. Sage had multiple small things that were just more work than in Mathematica, e.g. like always declaring variables as `x, y = var('x y')`. Maybe this would get easier as you use it more, but coming from Mathematica a lot of things just felt harder to do. - Mathematica has the full manpower of Wolfram behind it. This means that it has a lot more algorithms built in, making it much more powerful for calculating integrals, solving differential equations or simplifying relations. While Sage was useable, I couldn't get some things to work the way I wanted it to. - For a lot of things Mathematica seemed to be quite faster. This might also be because it has better algorithms for integration etc. I played around with [SageManifolds](https://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr/) for quite a while, and it is fantastic and very fun to use. But for day to day work Mathematica just seemed so much easier.
Neat

Yum
&gt; The fact that the proposed dict operator loses more information than concatenation or addition is not unprecedented for the + operator in Python Can you give an example that is worse than this? &gt;You also keep mentioning upsert and I don't understand why. The operation doesn't have anything to do with upsert. upsert is a keyword used by DBMS, which basically means "update if exists, else insert", which is the behavior proposed in the PEP. Technically it is not upsert because in this case it is acting on a copy instead of the original data, so it would fit better to describe `+=`, but I hoped people with SQL experience would immediately understand.
Because you have an extra colon. The colon marks the end of the “if” condition, it does not separate parts of an expression (for that use parentheses). 
I just updated it. my code doesn't have the colon it's just that when I was adding it to reddit I put that in there by mistake. 
Oh man. This is just what I was looking for. Thank you!
I just figured it..... must be an order of operations thing maybe someone can explain this to me.... `if s.StartMode != 'Disabled' and ('something' in s.DisplayName or 'something' in s.PathName):` &amp;#x200B; The code above works. &amp;#x200B;
Use parentheses to indicate if you mean "A and (B or C)" or "(A and B) or C".
that is totally it I figured it out like 5 mins after I posted this haha. can you explain why or point me to an explination? I don't get why it's really necessary.
&gt;If your response is that "but there is precedence for + to mean concat" then I would point you to the example mentioned in the PEP. collections.Counter has + mean update. Not true. &gt;&gt;&gt; from collections import Counter &gt;&gt;&gt; Counter(a=2) + Counter(a=3) Counter({'a': 5}) &gt;&gt;&gt; {'a': 2} + {'a': 3} {'a': 3}
wait never mind.... not enough coffee today.... ugh! so correct me if I am wrong here my way was if s.StartMode != 'Disabled' and 'something' in s.DisplayName or 'something' in s.PathName: so the first part returned false but because of the second or statement still evaluated to true in the end. &amp;#x200B; whereas if s.StartMode != 'Disabled' and ('something' in s.DisplayName or 'something' in s.PathName): the second part would be true but the first part returns false so the whole thing fails.... &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
&gt;But it doesn't make logical sense to "add" two dicts together. Exactly. You finally understand my point. + is the closest conceptual operator, but not close enough. Explain why values from two dict is not combined into a list instead of discarding the first value.
 &gt;&gt;&gt; a = Counter(a=2) &gt;&gt;&gt; b = Counter(a=2) &gt;&gt;&gt; a.update(b) &gt;&gt;&gt; a counter({'a': 5}) Counter has `update` overloaded as well as `+` to do its special behavior. 
*Woah!* It's your **2nd Cakeday** elrey_scarbrow! ^(hug)
I'll assign arbitrary truth values the the 3 expressions to show why. A = false B = false C = true A and (B or C) = F and (F or T) = F and T = false (A and B) or C = (F and F) or T = F or T = true 
Yes a bad precedence. It conflicts with dict.update behaviour, so this should not be followed. Also, its a class most python programmers don't know about, so this precedence is not meaningful. + meaning concat is seen in most popular languages. How often do you see + meaning update anywhere else?
What other meaning of "concat" is there for a dictionary? I view concat and update as very similar things.
I see on your Chanel, you made a video how to setup python with visual code. Could explain why did you choose VS and not pyCharm ?
That’s the whole beauty of unit test helpers like parameterized and Mock. It’s so easy to extend tests on your functions so that you don’t regress in other places without noticing when you fix your logic.
The `os.system` function invokes your command using a subshell -- the arguments are interpreted by the shell before `ffmpeg` is invoked. The characters you're trying to deal with are a problem because they have special meaning to the shell. As is says in the `os.system` documentation: &gt;The [subprocess](https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html) module provides more powerful facilities for spawning new processes and retrieving their results; using that module is preferable to using this function. See the [Replacing Older Functions with the subprocess Module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#replacing-older-functions-with-the-subprocess-module) section in the subprocess documentation for some helpful recipes. One advantage of the `subprocess` functions is that you pass a list or tuple of command arguments instead of a string and those arguments are passed directly to the command you're running -- no shell interpretation happens. You probably want `subprocess.run` in this case, but there are other functions that act a bit differently. Just be sure you don't pass `shell=True` to any of them. 
Hey! I'll join :) 
maybe ill try the subprocess approach in the 2nd iteration. i made it work with shlex. ty anyway, this does clarify some subprocess questions i had

Why is it not close enough? You have to think for a second about what it could mean but there are no surprises. There's no reason [1,2] + [3,4] shouldn't equal [[1,2],[3,4]] or "a" * 3 shouldn't equal ("a", "a", "a") but the operations have been chosen. It's too much to expect mathematical operators to have an exactly predictable behavior on more complex data structures than numbers. 
I expect `+` to **add** together values from two dict into a list, not **update**.
Contact your IT department and have it installed? This should be seen by them as a reasonable request.
Yes. The original line is interpreted by Python like this: ``` if (s.StartMode != 'Disabled' and 'something' in s.DisplayName) or ('something' in s.PathName): ``` What you wanted is: ``` if s.StartMode != 'Disabled' and ('something' in s.DisplayName or 'something' in s.PathName): ```
Hi! You've got this. Stack overflow has helpful questions and comments from programmers of all levels, and everyone is generally nice. Most of the time, if you google something like, "Python global variable," stack overflow will be the first hit. As far as global variable goes, let me know if **Example 4** in this link helps: [https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/global-local-nonlocal-variables](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/global-local-nonlocal-variables) Conditional statements typically have if and a stated or unstated else condition (if johnny has 4 apples, he has 4. Else, Johnny does not have 4). The above example includes an if and else conditional phrase, so you should be good there. Lastly, a control flow loop can be **iterative** (for post in list\_of\_posts), meaning that you are asking the python interpreter to go through each post in a list of posts, or it can also be **conditional** (while x is not equal to 3, keep performing the same steps until x does equal 3). &amp;#x200B; Hope this helps some. Sorry if I reiterated anything that you've already learned/heard. Good luck! 
Why is it too much to expect the behaviour closely follow what the symbol means? Your examples all make sense either case. `+` meaning update doesnt make sense.
From the outside looking in, there seems to be a lot of drama or heated discussions in the pep suggestion community. Is this assertion correction or was the shock of 572 just what I'm extrapolating from? 
Here's the problem: Python is a Turing complete programming language. This means that it can do basically anything that can be done with a computer - especially when you can install libraries. This is, essentially, the same as unlocking the machines. I've worked in locked down environments and worked as a systems administrator, and if you put me at a restricted computer with a full Python environment and the ability to install libraries, it won't stay restricted for long. &amp;#x200B; Ok... that's a pro talking. But students........ It will take them marginally longer than it would take me. Think days instead of hours.
Could you install Python to USB sticks and run it that way? As far as I know, that still works with the python.org installer. Of course, if your school IT folks have locked down the USB ports, you’re still in the same boat. As has already been said, though, the best solution is to include the IT folks in the discussion and work together. If you have a legitimate reason to use Python they should be willing and able to install it for you.
Thanks
Nothing else in the standard library operates element-wise, why would this do so? Why would it build a list, not a tuple or a concatenated string?
Of course you do it everywhere but claiming it somehow proects you from this kind of error won't work past small codes.
Watching this out of interest that it’s from the ground up. Keep going.
What will be the final 2.7.x?
Yes, for a basic desktop app, but it's hard. The widgets are also slow with large amounts of data.
Yeah but it's for a class - a programming class. They're just kind of gonna have to accept that they're not really locked. Seems like something that should've been installed already over the holiday if they were planning on having a programming class. Although I guess if the class was new and the teacher and didn't have a lesson plan I can see how the IT request could've gotten missed.
+= works with many sequence types, including lists, deques, and tuples (yes, even though they're immutable). Extend guarantees the modification is applied in-place, while += just guarantees the thing you're assigning to will reflect the change. `[*itr, ...]` also eagerly iterates over `itr` and converts it to a list. This is different than .append if `itr` is a deque or other sequence. In both cases, the operators only work when you can assign back to the left-hand side. For example, imagine if `sys.path` was a function. While these happen to behave the same in some (most?)ncases, there are enough differences that imo they can coexist with the One Right Way zen.
This was a good Django tutorial and showed how to interact with the database in Python but I don’t think I’d consider it data engineering.
Check out the [PySimpleGUI docs](http://www.PySimpleGUI.org). There's a cookbook that's good. To do the kinds of graphics you are looking for with PySimpleGUI, you'll want to stick to the standard tkinter version. The Qt version *might* work depending on which types of graphics primitives you are using. You can use it to ***easily*** draw points, likes, circles, text, rectangles. etc. There's a Graph widget that enables you to work in your own coordinate system for example. Really simplifies code. You will find a TON of sample code on the GitHub site. Well over 100 Demo programs for the tkinter version alone.
I feel like (l/r)shifts (i.e. &lt;&lt; and &gt;&gt;) would have been the least ambiguous choice for an upsert - the pointy side corresponding to the dict whose keys get overwritten on conflict. &amp;#x200B; As far as the atomic drop of entries goes... \`-\` seems to suggest a symmetry with \`+\`, which would be misleading but consistent with the interface of sets. \`\^\` is the perfect mirror image - unique, but inconsistent with sets. TBH, I'd just add a \`dict.drop(it: Iterable) -&gt; dict\` method and be done with it, dropping keys en masse is not something I really ever needed to do. &amp;#x200B; Incidentally, my new band Atomic Drop is currently looking for a bassist since our previous one fell victim to a freak cascading accident.
&gt; order of operations aka operator precedence: https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#operator-precedence
I am a little irked at the subtraction case because it's not 100% obvious that it is only concerned with the set of keys. If both operands have the same key but different values, you have to stop and remember that this is irrelevant for the difference between dicts.
This is a nice demonstration of how much be done in just a few lines of Python code, but it's not really a "voice chat" program because it's only one-way. It's more like a simple Python covert listening device, or "bug". If you really want to make this a "multi-client voice chat" program, the "server" should receive the audio from each client and send the audio received from every clients to every other connected client. IMHO, the "server" should not do any Pyaudio I/O on the server machine; it should only send and receive the audio from the clients, and each client should both send and receive audio from the server. I did notice one tiny bug, when the server is shut down with a keyboard interrupt, it only closes one connection before the "break". Although the ending of the program will obviously close the remaining connections, it would be nicer if the server could signal each clients that it is shutting down so they could close their end of the connection gracefully. Your code is really clean, it just seems feature-incomplete to me. In addition to real "two-way" audio, what this program is really missing is a GUI front-end, with buttons to connect, disconnect, and mute. You could probably add a nice Tkinter GUI with another 100 lines of code.

I resurrected a joke Twitter bot that I made years ago: https://twitter.com/WaveConsortium It had stopped working; I don't quite remember why.
That would require evaluating all four operands up front to check that they're all dicts (or instances of a subclass that doesn't override \_\_add\_\_ or \_\_radd\_\_), which breaks the guarantee that expressions are evaluated left to right.
And 3.7. The Python Software Foundation supports a number of old versions because new versions come out regularly enough that it would be hell for organisations with big codebases to try to standardise on anything otherwise. If you look at the release schedule for each minor version, you'll see that some have an "end-of-life" date. 2.6 and lower are EOL, as are 3.0 through 3.3: as such there are 5 minor versions still supported, across 2 major versions. 2.7 is going EOL 2020-01-01; 3.4 will go EOL in a month or so from now. 
Pretty nice to create a dict with this (explained elsewhere in the thread as well) DEFAULTS = {"k1": "foo", "k2": "bar"} user_input = {"k1": "baz"} {**DEFAULTS, **user_input} The dictionaries are evaluated from left to right.
Which means that it falls into the "can do whatever it likes" bucket. Presumably, a fourth category for mappings will be added with this.
I would expect `^` to do something XORy, like what it does for sets. I would at least expect it to be commutative.
With 4 or just 3?
What's with all the YouTube channel self-promotion lately?
Hah. Yes.
Ahh, you're right. I was definitely not at my sharpest this morning it seems.
Because if we're going to have linear operators like addition applying to things for which they don't make sense, like lists and strings, we either disallow them because they're not strictly mathematical or we have them so long as they kind of make sense, for convenience. list + list works but list + int doesn't, meanwhile list * list fails but list * int is ok and list * float fails. List + list also doesn't obey the commutative property, the order of addition matters, we're just building helpful abstractions, not sticking to strict formalism, it's python not haskell! Dict + dict is helpful and i knew exactly what it would do when i saw it and I bet you did too. 
That's a good point. TruePython is dead--anyone interested in a revival / know if /u/thorax is still active?
BTW, I don't think IDLE has enough in it to be a viable editor for anything beyond beginner tutorials so I recommend you take the time to pick something from here: &amp;#x200B; [https://realpython.com/python-ides-code-editors-guide/](https://realpython.com/python-ides-code-editors-guide/) &amp;#x200B; ... likely you want "**Category:** Code Editor" to start.

Hey there! Do you have any thoughts on a TruePython revival, in the spirit of /u/saxondown 's comment?
I'd love it. If there are some mods interested in spearheading this, I'll grant access. I don't have the cycles to drive anything like that but happy to invite mods to the subreddit for that purpose as long as it remains healthy.

Hi there! Thank you for taking the time to respond and critique my code, I really appreciate it! :) You do make a good point considering how this truly isn't a "voice chat" program. I made this simple program because I plan to implement it to a larger project I'm working on. But I will definitely add your input where the server only receives/sends audio data and not do any PyAudio I/O. I'll also add the "graceful shutdown" feature you recommended. Do you think something like this can work? for client in CONNECTED_CLIENTS: client.close() Also, would you happen to have any experience with PyQT? I've worked with Tkinter before, but there is a lot of support for PYQT.
If by "manual process" you mean combining the images into a video, you could do this in code as well. As long as the image filenames are sorted in some way (perhaps by date), then you could pretty easily just turn them into a video. It's just a matter of figuring out how to iterate through the images in the order you want. Here's some example code for doing so: [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44947505/how-to-make-a-movie-out-of-images-in-python/44948030](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44947505/how-to-make-a-movie-out-of-images-in-python/44948030) &amp;#x200B; Does this answer your question?

'Education Data' &gt;&gt;&gt; ss.title = 'Class Data' # Change the title. &gt;&gt;&gt; ss.sheetTitles # The titles of all the Sheet objects in this Spreadsheet. ('Students', 'Classes', 'Resources') &gt;&gt;&gt; ss[0] # The first Sheet object in this Spreadsheet. &lt;Sheet sheetId=0, title='Students', rowCount=1000, columnCount=26&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; ss.downloadAsExcel() 'Education_Data.xlsx' &gt;&gt;&gt; sheet = ss[0] &gt;&gt;&gt; sheet['A1'] = 'Name' # Set the value in cell A1. &gt;&gt;&gt; sheet['B1'] = 'Age' &gt;&gt;&gt; sheet['C1'] = 'Favorite Movie' &gt;&gt;&gt; sheet['A1'] # Read the value in cell A1. 'Name' &gt;&gt;&gt; sheet['A2'] # Empty cells return a blank string. '' &gt;&gt;&gt; sheet[2, 1] # Column 2, Row 1 is the same address as B1. 'Age' &gt;&gt;&gt; sheet['A2'] = 'Alice' &gt;&gt;&gt; sheet['B2'] = 30 &gt;&gt;&gt; sheet['C2'] = 'RoboCop' The Google Sheets spreadsheet gets updated in real-time. 
/r /learnpython And check the side bar
This is not really a /r/learnpython post. I’m asking about python education but not asking how to learn python. 
For starters, the object probably doesn't even exist until during execution. Consider the example 1.0+2-'s' This gives the error TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for -: 'float' and 'str' But what is the 'float'? The operators here are evaluated left to right, so the snippet is equivalent to (1.0+2)-'s' The 'float' in question is thus 3.0, which doesn't appear in the code at all. Similarly, if you were to do 1.0+(2-'s') then you get TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for -: 'int' and 'str' as expected. But then you ask, how should you identify the objects there? There are no variable names, so you can't refer to them as say 'x' or 'y'. The best you could do is to print out the value itself e.g. TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for -: 'int' (2) and 'str' ('s') In this simple example, it's clear what's what. In the first example, it would be less obvious why 1.0+2-'s' would give TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for -: 'float' (3.0) and 'str' ('s') and in the case where the objects in question were user defined objects, the string representation might not even exist e.g. suppose you did class Foo(): pass x = Foo() y = Foo() x+y which currently gives TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'Foo' and 'Foo' Then adding in the string representation would give the not very useful output TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'Foo' (&lt;__main__.Foo object at 0x000002D6CA4B91D0&gt;) and 'Foo' (&lt;__main__.Foo object at 0x000002D6CA4A22B0&gt;) Much better would be to just a) use an IDE with a debugger that lets you inspect the variables at the point they're being used, or b) separate out the problematic statement into the individual operations.

Hi there, from the /r/Python mods. We have removed this post as it is not suited to the /r/Python subreddit proper, however it should be very appropriate for our sister subreddit /r/LearnPython or for the r/Python discord: https://discord.gg/3Abzge7. The reason for the removal is that /r/Python is dedicated to discussion of Python news, projects, uses and debates. It is not designed to act as Q&amp;A or FAQ board. The regular community is not a fan of "how do I..." questions, so you will not get the best responses over here. On /r/LearnPython the community and the r/Python discord are actively expecting questions and are looking to help. You can expect far more understanding, encouraging and insightful responses over there. **No matter what level of question you have, if you are looking for help with Python, you should get good answers**. Make sure to check out the rules for both places. Warm regards, and best of luck with your Pythoneering!
Before anyone flames me to death I support both Django and Flask and have used both of them in different projects. That being said this post is quite misleading. First it represents many things as part of Flask and not part of Django, as one example jinja2 templates are absolutely part of Django. &amp;#x200B; [https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/topics/templates/](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/topics/templates/) Additional features available off the shelf in django that this post made it seem are exclusive to Flask: Unit Testing Debugging Development Server Secure Cookies WSGI compliance REST routing (through django-rest) &amp;#x200B; Additionally Django does not require you explicitly to use its modeling for your data connection this means that it has approximately the same noSQL support as Flask does. &amp;#x200B; Django is basically about as complicated as Flask to learn. The difference with flask is at some point you just know Flask, at that same moment with Django you can do all the same stuff but you are also just starting to learn all the incredibly powerful advanced things you can do with Django that you can't do anywhere else. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
Does cherypy have anti-exploit features like django? What python web framework is considered to be the most secure?
I had a programming class in C taught on locked down chromebooks in highschool. We had to use a website to compile and run our programs. After a while our teacher basically told us that while we weren't officially allowed to bring in our own laptops, he wouldn't see anything.
Stack Overflow is where you go to post questions to. Any time you have a programming related question, if you google it, it's likely someone has already asked it on stack overflow. That's what the site is made for, and it's really good for that. Reddit is a link aggregator site, meaning the front page of a subreddit is (ostensibly) supposed to be full of interesting links or discussion about a topic. There are help communities where you can post questions to (/r/learnpython, for example), but that's not what this site is built for and it's not great at doing that. Reddit is... hard to explain, but it's good for getting news or other helpful articles related to your interests in subreddits related to them (like /r/python, /r/programming, /r/chemistry, etc). There's also a lot of memes. Either way, both sites have a lot to offer and a lot of meaningful discussions happen in both places, but they have very different missions.

We have [a pretty long list of learning resources in the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/index#wiki_new_to_programming.3F). Try a few and see what resonates. For a brand new programmer I'd recommend automate the boring stuff with python. Also, if you don't have one already make sure you look for a project that interests you and start on it as soon as you can. Programming is a lot more fun if you have a goal. Come visit us in /r/learnpython if you get stuck.

It is easy to begin, and create good working programs. Many believe it is the easiest. The more difficult part is understanding the programming concepts and how to structure your program efficiently. But that will come with time. 
Thank you. I have tried and thus far the terminology is a great barrier
Try and look at this as if you are working with two separate service here (cause you are). The first is the frontend generating the views and the second is your back end API. The front end is simply communicating with the API back end using http requests so the only way it knows what's happening with it is if the backend provides a response with that information that the front end understands. So in this case, you need to be doing error handling at the top for both the API backend and the frontend. So on the back end you catch the errors before returning a response to the request and then structure the response to include any information from the error the front end would need and send it back. With your API providing structured responses when errors occur, you can then turn around and write your front end logic to include checking for any errors the backend may have had and acting accordingly. Then, since a structured response from the backend is supposed to be guaranteed, you can probably get by with a try/catch around the form logic to handle edge cases where a proper response isn't given. Each project is unique though and you'll have to walk through your program and find the parts that could run into errors and handle them accordingly. Simply adding try/catch's at the top level of your services will only lead to masking errors and your goal should be for your application to be able to ***handle*** and ***correct*** those errors.

Actually hard
It is one of the easiest languages to learn. People tend to like it a lot, especially if they have learned some other language first... because of the pains they have undergone while learning the other language. No language is perfect... and you will run into constraints with Python as well. But rest assured... for every hurdle you encounter with python, you avoided 5 others which you would have encountered with almost any other language. 
I like the phrase "easy to learn, hard to master."

I am talking about the subprocess module. By multi-platform I mean that the python module used to accomplish what I want should run on different operating systems, namely windows, linux and mac. What I am trying to accomplish is to launch an external program within the python script and monitor it. By monitoring I mean that I want to know if it receives signals such as SIGSEGV. Sockets will not do, as they cannot be used to catch OS-level signals.
It depends, If you know other programming languages then **python** will be easy for you, but If **python** is your First language then it may be difficult For you But it is very easy to learn if u compare to *C/C#/C++* Or *java* and also it is too powerful too if You need any help learning **python** ask me
Given your experience, the hard part is not learning Python (which, as far as programming languages go, doesn't get in your way much), but learning general programming concepts, techniques, and problem solving approaches. An experienced programmer who already has half a dozen programming languages under their belt can usually just walk through an introductory tutorial, and start working on production Python code within a week or two. But someone who has never programmed anything before will take longer - how long exactly is hard to predict, because some people have a much easier time thinking like a programmer than others, and those will pick things up much faster. Either way, 6 months with reasonable tutoring or good learning materials, and some motivation, should go a long way.
I also just picked up my first python book. Good luck!
Awesome! :) You are welcome! :)

Hi, thanks for your answers rmccorm4! Yes, combining the images into a video is a easy exercise - however, drawing up the 14day/montly/early averages is much more difficult task (atleast for me). 
Hi, interesting question. Well, mainly it's just a matter of personal preferences. I have used PyCharm a lot in the past, then switched to using mostly Atom, now VS Code! It is fast, well maintained, powerful and 100% free ;)
Why do you want to subclass anything? I'd spontaneously just make a context Manager class using open and seek inside

It just do

PEP572 didn't go down well as people are hesitant to introduce new syntax, for a one line gain it took quite the forcing. If it wasn't Guido that was sponsoring it there's no way it would've gone through. Apart form that I can't see that much that is frosty really.

Not very hard. Start with a DataCamp course.
Thank you.
Yes, but none of them are very clear. 
Start doing some homework on basic data structures and algorithms. The field is absolutely riddled with buzzwords and extraneous terminology, but those two are particularly important. An example of a data structure would be an [Array](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_arrays.asp), and an example of an Algorithm could be a method to [Merge](http://interactivepython.org/courselib/static/pythonds/SortSearch/TheMergeSort.html) two arrays into one sorted array. If you have two unordered *lists* of numbers or words, and apply language specific syntax in an order implied by the *algorithm* then your end result should be a single list of sorted variables. Once you're past the difficulties with syntax and terminology, you'll likely find that the rest of programming is studying to constantly add new tools to your toolkit. As your toolkit expands, so does your ability to create! If this was remotely helpful and you feel like you need any help along the way, feel free to drop me a PM.

The Ring documentation says it was inspired by [WSGI](https://wsgi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) which is somewhat similar to what you’re looking for.
Until it don't.
If you really like the dictionary approach, you can just use the __dict__ attribute for weird workarounds to achieve it. But why would you? Instead of doing dict["content"], you do req_object.content/req_object.status_code. Requests' abstraction for these kind of things is quite fantastic imo.
I totally agree with you, and I sent counter proposal; use method instead of `+`. https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-ideas/2019-March/055648.html

Yeah, you probably could send an email to IT with python
I’m confused by what you’re asking / proposing here. Admittedly this is largely because of your writing style; am I correct that English is not your first language? Some of the wording is quite difficult to follow and may need more explanation. To try and add to the conversation: I am not a user of Julia, but I believe that I have read that it can optionally be made to compile to a static binary that exports a C-ABI; if this is true then Python-calling-Julia interop is already possible using **ctypes** (or **cffi**), albeit with that static compilation step. This is not exactly _easy_, but it is the normal answer for situations in which Python needs to call into other languages when those languages export a C ABI. If what you want is Python-calling-Julia that is probably quite sufficient and has the advantage of being well travelled and quite robust. But it appears you’re also talking about using Python to _write_ Julia ... and I suppose my main question there would be _why_ would you want to do that? Why not just write in Julia? It might help a lot if you could provide some specific examples of what workflow issues and tasks would solve, as well as how it would improve on the Cython / Numpy / Numba / C approaches that already exist.

Nobody is going to do your homework for you. If you post your attempts and explain why they aren't working, r/learnpython might be willing to help you understand how to move forward.
Do you have any simpler tasks for newer python users i am a computer science student and I wanted to try some more complex stuff without overkilling it. 
It's not that complicated if that's the only functionality you want.
I'm not a bot but r/learnpython. And maybe work on that spelling there... I have no idea what you're asking. Seriously read the god damn sidebar before posting.
ah thanks im new to this subreddit so im not really familiar with how to get things done thanks for clarifying! also my attempts are working but the code is not accepted
Because the implicit goal was to write Python and writing in Julia contradicts it. Sorry for being not clear enough. But I guess Python to Julia transpiler is needed only to pythonistas so you can dismiss it as irresponsible chatter. The first question is more interesting : https://github.com/numba/numba/issues/3814#issuecomment-469653102 Quote : Do you think it's possible to get a compatible ecosystem of python packages that expose API at C level so that packages can be combined in jit compilation (both export C functions and accept)? C is universal to Cython, Numba and C++/C backends. I'm no expert and I have worries that the fact that already precompiled libraries are compiled together can lead to instability or simply performance degradations as they cannot be optimized by compiler together (degradation in comparison with compiling the whole thing from sources). 
These are all things that were done in Python 2.7.0, nine years ago. 2.7.16 is a bugfix release for the Python 2.7 series; it does not add any new features to Python 2.7. Another comment in this thread linked the changelog documents showing the bugs fixed in 2.7.16.
Not accepted by whom and what reason did they give? 
I've been hanging my head around the but I think it's because I haven't tried enough.
what do you mean to IT? I want to know how to do it because I am IT.
Why not powershell? It’s built into windows and works well with sharepoint. 
If you have additional questions then you can read [issue discussion](https://github.com/numba/numba/issues/3814) as this post is a continuation of it.

Hrm. I think I’ve found an error in this doc, but I don’t want to investigate because last time I did that I accidentally started implementing a PEP..

Oh, I completely confused them. I meant the (-, +, +, +) metric which then naturally produces imaginary proper time, which is what Schroedinger's equation naturally wants anyway (I though that Maxwell equations also have a similar form, but now I'm really not sure).
It's a "thing" these days where people write blog posts to certain platforms to generate traffic / brand recognition. Companies will often ask people in the tech scene to do this, Medium.com is a great example of it. Unfortunately the majority of the blog posts are meaningless jibberish like this.
sure ye sorry lol
Spot on!! But not super important 
You’re quoting your own question there... I’ve read the discussion, but I’m not sure anyone in it is understanding exactly what you’re after, any more than I do. I can’t be sure, but you seem to be confusing API with ABI... the C ABI is stable, that’s why it’s used by languages like Python as the baseline for FFI, but that’s not the same thing as an API. Python will likely never export a stable ABI of its own, and that’s pretty standard for an interpreted or JIT-compiled language. Any language that has an FFI that can call into the C ABI though can already [call CPython](https://docs.python.org/3/extending/embedding.html) and thus run Python code. So with my previous answer you can write Python to call Julia, and with the above you can write Julia to call Python.., bidirectional interop already exists. The question of pre-compiled libraries (at least in terms of Python) doesn’t make clear sense, since Python packages for the most part have no compiled component, and those that do are usually _extensions_, lacking most of the functionality of a library. This is where, again, a clear explanation of what problem you’re trying to address would be very helpful. Yes, transpiling to Julia would be possible, but _why_? To what end? If someone knows _only_ Python and does not know Julia, why would they want to write something that transpiles to Julia? Such an argument has already been made and has a good answer for transpiling to JavaScript — ie to run natively in the browser — but someone has to make the argument for there to be much reason to act on it.
Every problem can get pretty complex. My advice is to try to divide it into smaller problems as much as you can. That way you can focus on one problem at a time.

I´m pretty much in the same boat as you. Have gone through some Automate The Boring Stuff before, now i´m going through the basics on DataCamp. 
Look into PyInstaller. Also, honestly, I'm not sure how complicated your application is, but it's very likely you should just release it under an open source license instead.
I think the reason against this is that since pathlib is an object-oriented API, its users should be able to treat a `Path` as a black box, i.e. use it without knowing its internal state. Since users need to understand the path they're dealing with to know whether calling `normpath` on it is save or would change its meaning, offering an equivalent on `Path` would violate that design consideration.
Awesome, thanks for sharing mate! 
But I cannot sell Open Source app, don't I?
You can't. That's my point. Windows users are not used to buying command line apps, or using command line apps. Also, it being a command line app probably means it does something niche, which limits your market even more. If you're not going to make much money anyway, it might be a better idea to just open source it.
Hey guys I'm working on a sort of selective Chromebook inventory algorithm for G Suite, with the purpose of creating an xlsx file that then uploads to Google Drive automatically, containing chromebooks in the domain which have been unused for a certain period of time, specified by the user. This is to help schools and other institutions reduce the amount of unnecessary chromebook purchases when in fact they may have 'inactive' ones (read, not used for a while) - laying around. So the point is to create a sheet with these devices. &amp;#x200B; I'm new to python and well, programming in general (&lt; 1 year of active programming under my belt) but it's chugging along nicely. I use subprocess to interact with an open source project called GAM since it's written in 2.7 and I strictly use 3+. 
wow you guys, very constructive, ad hominem much :)
I'm aware of what I'm quoting. Thanks for reminding. As about your last 3 paragraphs. The Transcrypt that transpiles to JavaScript does this not to run in a browser but in order to write JavaScript code in Python. The user of Transcrypt should be aware that they actually write something that would be transpiled to JavaScript otherwise it would be bad (and be familiar with JavaScript obviously). It's written there on Transcrypt site. If the goal was to simply run in the browser then using JavaScript would have been enough. As about API/ABI. The use case for this is building an ecosystem of reusable math algorithms. Let's assume we have integration library python module that's written in C. And we need to pass integrand function there. If the module only accepts python function it would be slow. So it has to be able to accept compiled C function (what's the right name for it?) to run fast. Nubma can already conveniently jit compile C types functions. But imagine that we also want to use the second python module in the integrand. It the module only has Python interface then we again get slow behavior. So the second module have to export interface with C function (or something) that can be used in a code that would be jit compiled and passed to the integration library. So I'm curious what's the state of this workflow in Python. Is it possible? Does it already exist?
The above is something I use fairly often.
wsgi inspired ring and also rack(ruby). pyramid supports wsgi but i'm pretty sure every python web framework supports it at some level which is basically supply a function that takes 2 params. 1: a dictionary that represents a http request, and 2: a callback function which takes the http status and a dictionary of http headers typically called \`start\_response\` the application function returns an iterable which is the response body. It's a pretty elegant protocol in and of itself. this function is what servers like gunicorn/uwsgi expect &amp;#x200B; but the reason frameworks usually hide this from you is that the dictionary representing the request is hard to deal with on it's own since it is literally the implementation of the http protocol. which is why you have objects that implement the http request and response. in pyramids case it's \`webob\` or at least originally what flask was originally based on \`werkzeug\`'s Request and Response objects. &amp;#x200B; [http://wsgi.tutorial.codepoint.net/application-interface](http://wsgi.tutorial.codepoint.net/application-interface) &amp;#x200B; [https://webob.org/](https://webob.org/) &amp;#x200B; [http://werkzeug.pocoo.org/](http://werkzeug.pocoo.org/) &amp;#x200B;
It was a blatant insult not an ad-hominem one, use words you don't know much?
Python is probably the wrong choice for something like that. Using pyinstaller/py2exe does not obfuscate the code and even if you ship only pyc files the source can be recovered via decompyle and other tools. It would be trivial to take your code, remove whatever license checking you do, and use it anyways. You may be able to get crafty by encrypting the code and deploying a wrapper script that gets a secret from a master server to decode your application or something but at that point you're working pretty hard to jam a square peg in a round hole. Also, it's a cli tool on windows... As someone else stated, you are not likely to sell many copies no matter what it does. I respect your hustle but this is probably not something that will be lucrative. In the spirit of sharing and openness it would probably benefit you more to release the tool as open source and use it as an example on your resume. But, that's just one man's opinion. Do you. Good luck either way.

Windows developers, of which there are many, may buy this app. Powershell is honestly better than bash/sh in a lot of ways.
I'm absolutely sure you've considered this but to help us help you could you explain why you're not just setting up a webserver for this? 1. Set up licensing server. 2. Software requires a key to "activate", which is transmitted to the server. If it matches some schema it's valid. 3. Mark key as invalid if you want.
I watched the video, and *all* of the content appears to be a matter of preference. It reduces verbosity but distorts the language enough that other python programmers who don't know Haskel will have a hard time with it. The coconut stuff compiles to "readable" python, but it's not as readable as if you just wrote it in python to start with. The primary pitfall of a non-functional style of programming in python is that you might be unaware that the state of an input to a function may be changed. Unit testing can cover you on this, and with a little bit of experience you can avoid writing functions that do this kind of thing. (There might even be a very automatic way of unit testing for this or inspecting for it). The pandas library in it's early days incidentally encouraged these kinds of mutability mistakes and has undergone design changes that are more like functional programming, I think that's a good model to follow. 
What does your app actually do?
well blatant insult isn't any better. . but lets deconstruct the statement boring information, therefore, assume a person is paid to right (write) the information X = Y but wait, Y (paid article) can also be -X (not boring) so X is in quantum state, so the immutable constant here is Y however content and information is fundamentally neutral, boring is a perception, it can be boring for you but not necessarily for others and the primary function of information is to inform, thus the word inform . ation
Is that why the content isn't useful?
All sorts of pseudo-intellectual aren't ya.
There is an example of such workflow: https://stackoverflow.com/a/51157909/9071377 It's pain to see it. If you want something more elegant then there is Julia for you. So I guess I got the answer for my first question :( Using C for integration of math if possible but it looks frustrating. So using Julia is preferable. At the moment there is no py2ju transpiler so if someone wants elegant math research and prototyping they should try Julia. But I think it would be fun to have Python to Julia transpiler. And if it would ever be written it would be written by someone that also think that it's fun.

Sorry, I mentioned you quoting your own question because in the previous post it sounded like you were saying that was a question you’d been asked, rather than one you had asked yourself. It is not very usual to quote yourself in another context. And yes, I know you transpile Python code so you end up with JavaScript, but the primary _reason_ for doing so is so that you can run that code within a browser natively. And the people who wrote Transcrypt know this; please notice the tag line at the top of [their site](https://www.transcrypt.org/) and at the top [of their README](https://github.com/QQuick/Transcrypt): &gt; Python in the browser. If you’re not writing for a browser — where JS is first class and Python is not — then it would be considerably more efficient to _not_ transpile and just write Python to be run by the Python interpreter. There are relatively few good reasons for writing code in language A to be executed in the runtime of language B rather than write that code in language B. This is _especially_ True when the two languages involved suffer from similar problems of design. There are _excellent_ arguments for using — for instance — TypeScript or Elm to compile to JS, since both offer the likelihood of considerably better JS than you would likely hand write in JS... this is not particularly true of Python -&gt; JS. So the reason for Transcrypt’s existence is to allow someone to who is familiar with Python to write code in that language and execute the resulting transpiled JS in the browser... it is _not_ to write JS libraries intended for other JS consumers, though I suppose it could be used for that if you were also good at JS and happy to hand re-write the generated JS code. &gt; Let's assume we have integration library python module that's written in C. This is where we’ve got to be a bit careful with language. A vanilla Python (no module is written in Python, it _may_ be extended in C. Even if that function is imported into the module entirely from a C extension .so without wrapping code the function will take Python objects as arguments and will return Python objects. So in the case of an integration function like this the higher order function would always be one that accepts Python’s call interface, and couldn’t accept a C function if it wanted to. But that’s fine, if there’s a pure Python version it will be slow(er) and the extension version will be fast(er), but both will naturally have both accept and return Python objects. There is no “c function” to speak of, there’s just a c-implementation of the Python function. What Numba does is makes a machine-language implementation of the Python function that is basically swapped out under the hood. It’s essentially the same as using a C-implementation, and _may_ be just as fast once the JIT cache is warmer up. Cython does essentially the same thing as a C-implementation, it’s just written in a more Pythonic manner, though the resulting code is usually a little heavier weight and therefore slower than a hand-tuned C extension could be. In all cases these you can think of the high order function being passed as a black box... it may run slower (Python) or faster (Numba/Cython) or fastest (Cython/C), but none of these yet require interaction with the C ABI... these are all native Python functions, not _foreign_ functions. &gt; So the second module have to export interface with C function (or something) that can be used in a code that would be jit compiled and passed to the integration library. Well yes, the second black box needs to be as fast as required to do the job. But whether you do that via Numba’s JIT or in-line Cython or a separate C extension is up to you. The JIT is a convenient pathway for writing faster code, that doesn’t make it the best alternative for making faster libraries. If I were looking to build up an ecosystem of re-usable math functions that were as fast as possible and meant to be used _within Python_, and these were general libraries intended to act on Python’s numerical primitives (not arrays), then I’d tend to say that the current standard is Cython. If they’re already intended to digest numpy arrays, then Numba has really done a lot of work there. I’m not sure why Julia enters into the equation... the idea of a “Juthon” alternative to Cython seems a bit odd... it leads again to the question of why not then just use Cython?

Please see the other comment about stackexchange answer. I got impression that integrand is a function that is passed to the underlying fast compiled integration library. And it's some low level C function not your typical Python function. Am I wrong? And integration library uses this function without calling python interpreter.
I would say that Julia exists to make numerical / scientific programming more elegant... it’s still early days, but that’s it’s primary focus. That is not now and never has been the case for Python. Python is, by design, a general purpose programming language meant to be used across a very wide number of domains. It happens to have become extremely popular in the numerical / scientific world, but that’s a side effect of it having been designed from very early on to be very good at C FFI... which is how it gets used to wrap so much C and FORTRAN code that it’s become very good at weaving together libraries written in those (and other) languages. But an elegant FFI and a wide range of applicable domains does not equate to an elegant experience in a single focused domain. That’s why there are languages that attempt to approach those domains more specifically. It remains to be seen which is the superior approach. _Many_ tasks don’t require elegance, but they do require a very wide ecosystem. The ecosystem for Python currently absolutely dwarfs that for Julia, and will most likely for many years.

Is there any better way out there?!
Love it haha
And add another tiny impossible to use geometry package?
Why are you writing code that's impossible to use?
No, you’re right, that bit of code appears to be compiling a machine language function with a C ABI that can be applied by numpy to all the items in a numpy array... all the items in a numpy array are C-compatible numerical types, so this saves having to marshal to and from Python types. The decorated **integrand** function therefore is not really a Python function at all. You’d have to use ctypes to call it from within Python, exactly as you would any other foreign function. Bit of an odd approach; and the complexity of the answer seems to have lead from the constraints of the question... so I’m not sure the answer code actually solves a well understood problem. But interesting.
No Vlookup in pandas. If there’s no vlookup then excel will continue to reign supreme.
Just the builtin Jinja templating engine that can be implemented using flask.render\_template.
I guess this is the Python answer to Julia... Disappointing. As stated in [this article](http://www.stochasticlifestyle.com/why-numba-and-cython-are-not-substitutes-for-julia/) the whole in Julia is more than the sum of parts. Having ecosystem of packages that can be easily and elegantly reused and combined into fast code is something that I cannot imagine in Python. Exept maybe if Numba would create C ABI functions more easily and automatically... So I came up with the transpiler idea. Actually now Numba does Python -&gt; llvm. The proposed transpiler would do Python -&gt; Julia -&gt; llvm but also itilize Julia packages ecosystem.
Thank you for a brief introduction to what the ‘wheel’ packages are. If you want to be sure the packages will work, is it encouraged to always download the source and compile it yourself?
