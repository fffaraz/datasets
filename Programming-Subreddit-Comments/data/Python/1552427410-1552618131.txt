Considering switching away from python because I can't load an URL with HTTPS and it's 2019. [https://bugs.python.org/issue20916](https://bugs.python.org/issue20916)
Well, it was a failed coup then.
That praise sounds a lot like how people praised windows XP at its end of life. It'd been around for so long it had time to really stabilize.
I don't really buy this argument. When I'm converting between bytes and strings and it makes me specify a character encoding, I just always put utf-8 by default and only consider changing it if it something breaks. Which is exactly how it's used in py2.7 as well. I don't see anything wrong with sane defaults
Thank you for your input. Trying to get it working on the mac is getting the code cleaner and it has forced me to implement more of the dll code. I also figured out how to generate test tokens with stoken as part of the troubleshooting, so now I can experiment with multiple tokens, multiple types of tokens, etc. I might have left this script sitting isolated and half-finished on my work hard drive had this post not popped up.
Thank you for the suggestions!

That could be. OTOH, I upgraded from Python 2.1 up through 2.7, and in that context 2.7 felt like a freaking racecar at the time. It was a genuinely good version, and Python 3 didn't catch up until about 3.4.
Personally haven’t used RStudio, but I’m aware of Rodeo as a Python IDE designed for data science. I also haven’t used it personally but seen it come up a few times in different conversations. It looks clean and useable to me. https://rodeo.yhat.com
Yes, and as a matter of fact I’m looking forward to use that in the library instead of re to expand further the range of functionalities. The reason I developed this instead of using regex is that I needed mainly two things: the ability to write patterns in the form of template and the ability query nested groups from their parents 
Guido was bumped off. I offered Nick Coughlin the BDFL job but despite disagreeing with the way Guido was behaving shoving features through he disagreed with bumping him off. I removed Coughlin from my list, which now had just one name: Raymond Hettinger, who dared to publicly say that features were being added too quickly lately. My work to make Hettinger BDFL continues apace now. I've been laying the groundwork for some time, including starting the "Dicts out for Hettinger" meme which sadly didn't catch on. 
I highly recommend using JupyterLab, customized with [this data viewing extension](https://github.com/quantopian/qgrid) and [this variable explorer extension](https://github.com/lckr/jupyterlab-variableInspector) With those installed and using split panes you can almost completely replicate the Rstudio experience.
At the end of the video, he makes a Python script to securely check if your password is in haveibeenpwned's database. He never provided the source code for this script, so I decided to make it myself : [https://github.com/iamwesley99/secure-haveibeenpwned](https://github.com/iamwesley99/secure-haveibeenpwned) &amp;#x200B; It's my first python script, so go easy on me thx
Why are you using `python -m pip install --upgrade pip`? That `pip` is not guaranteed to be the same `pip` as the `pip` in your `%PATH%`/`$PATH`. Try being consistent. If you're using `pip` straight up, do `pip install --upgrade pip`. If you're using `python -m pip install --upgrade pip`, then check the version with `python -m pip --version`. 
That's not quite what I mean. UTF-8 is pretty much _the_ encoding and it makes sense as a default. But more than that, a UTF-8 is _not_ the same as a series of bytes. In Python 2.7, it's easy to squint and imagine that bytes are strings and vice versa, which is generally true up until someone sends you an emoji or pasts a curly bracket into a text field. Then everything explodes and either you get weird exceptions in places where you don't expect them, or you accidentally store a series of escape codes in your database. Contract with Python 3 where the flow is generally: - Get a series of bytes from a file or network service. - Decode that (probably as UTF-8) into a unicode string. - Process it. - Encode that into a series of bytes. - Send that series of bytes over the wire or write it to a file. In py2, you could (and mostly people usually did) skip the decode/encode steps, and as long as you're only dealing with ASCII input and output, it would Just Work. People loved that because it was easy. Unfortunately, it was very wrong, too, and resulted in errors that were very hard to fix after the fact.

I dislike charts. Just give me projects you've worked on and other cool stuff you've done. Use google sheets to format the resume. Make grids to align things (like company name aligned left, dates right in 2 columns) then make the lines 0 width to hide them. It's free and easy. 
You can make a cmd shortcut that opens to the directory you need it to, for the fastest access to the script from the command line. For my personal projects, I have a cmd prompt open and minimized the entire time. I don't usually code in Windows, but I have a dos box open steadily when I do. In Linux, I use a pull down terminal.
This can be more of an unexpected pain than thought. I will look for my solution when I get home if noone has posted.

3rd week into being a QA Automation Engineer. Been working with Pylint and Yapf so far automating linting processes with python pre-commit scripts 👌🏼
Atom was developed / owned by git and Microsoft bought git, so I’d suggest using VS Code (if you like atoms style) as it’ll be deprecated here shortly. That or pycharm. Entirely up to the users preference... 
You have 90k karma so we know that you have been told to read the sidebar before....
You've been immensely helpful, thank you.
I have this weird love hate relationship with metaclasses. I feel like 99 times out of 100 it is the wrong approach. But, there's that 1 time you can build a really wicked API like the ORM that wouldn't be possible without it and that one time makes the other 99 terrible design choices worth it.
Wow these look great! Thanks for the suggestion! I'll definitely take a look at them
It'll go 3.9.x to 4.0.x. my understanding is no more major language usage changes like 2 to 3.
Yeah, I agree. There are times when you do need them. Like you, I once got carried away with them and learned my lesson to avoid them if possible.
In both C and Java, arrays and lists are extremely different as well. Please don't use the terms interchangeably when referring to a specific language. Mostly fine in psuedo-code as the concept of a linear collection is communicated, but not when talking language specific code.
You should see the sins I've committed with just normal inheritance, let alone metaclasses.
I did not look at the implementation, yet, but I love the idea. Some ungly regexes like verifying e-mail addresses could be made much more readable using your lib. In fact, have a look at: http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc822#section-6.1. I think you would make a perfect test case.
why use json storage? python file is a lot more convenient especially by being able to use raw string in context of regular expressoin.

Pip &amp; venv &amp; pipenv are all sub optimal... the language itself is great... I enjoy using it when it is the best tool for the job. But, it is as mentioned above for package management. The cheese warehouse that replaced the cheese shop has things moving in the right direction. I will even go as far as to say the package repository situation is first class-- but, all the great things I have to say about Python package management and portability end there.
Can you limit what is uploaded to google drive? In development I sometimes create env variables by `export`ing them, and sometimes those variables contain secrets like API keys and whatnot. I wouldn't want that stuff to be uploaded.
I sure hope so...
Use PIL or OpenCV to get the frames of the video. Find the star in the image. Scale the brightness (which is probably 0-255) to a frequency range. Generate a sound wave proportional to that.
&gt; Because that's what Guido said. True but Guido left so whoever gets his job might have a different idea. Probably not but it's possible.
The whole point of the matrix multiplication operator is to make it easier to do matrix multiplication in packages like numpy. It isn't even used in the standard library, it is purely for third-party packages. It was added at the request of numpy developers to make numpy (and similar packages) easier to use.
That was the plan at one point, but last I heard devs has changed their mind and there will be a 3.10.
Best teaching technique ever! Mold the students thinking by getting them to post blobs of broken code online for other people to fix.
That is only the case for semantic versioning. Python has never used semantic versioning.
Coming from R Studio and trying all of the Python IDEs, I'd say Spyder comes closest. As mentioned, Jupyter Lab is dope and has a cool variable explorer, but it's still being developed and I personally like Spyder's better. One thing I haven't found, is a variable explorer in a Python IDE that also displays any functions you've defined. RStudio does and I really miss that.
&gt; `pip install --upgrade pip` Unless that changed recently, that doesn't work on Windows since it tries to replace/remove the previous `pip.exe`, which is currently in use when you run it.

Hi argjend, as you are new, try breaking up your problem into steps and then researching how to perform each task step. For example: research upon topics like * monitoring for new files with python (for this, i recommend using the **watchdog** module - it is not included within python distribution: * scanning for text within files with python * writing text to files within python * sending email with python &amp;#x200B; For each of these individual task steps, write some test script which only performs the task you want to do. Once you understand how to perform that task, move on to the next task. You can later combine logic of these individual test scripts together. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;

Im having the same problem and from everything i have looked at the "tsk" library is only for techsmartkids 
&gt; Is it possible to Yes. If you can do it manually without invoking Dreaming or Magic then you can make a Turing-complete machine do it. The general approach is to split the problem into smaller and smaller pieces until you've reached the features the machine provides. Or at pay someone else to do it. And the hard part of your problem is _translation_, which you outsourced.

Hi there, from the /r/Python mods. We have removed this post as it is not suited to the /r/Python subreddit proper, however it should be very appropriate for our sister subreddit /r/LearnPython or for the r/Python discord: https://discord.gg/3Abzge7. The reason for the removal is that /r/Python is dedicated to discussion of Python news, projects, uses and debates. It is not designed to act as Q&amp;A or FAQ board. The regular community is not a fan of "how do I..." questions, so you will not get the best responses over here. On /r/LearnPython the community and the r/Python discord are actively expecting questions and are looking to help. You can expect far more understanding, encouraging and insightful responses over there. **No matter what level of question you have, if you are looking for help with Python, you should get good answers**. Make sure to check out the rules for both places. Warm regards, and best of luck with your Pythoneering!
TIL \_\_set\_name\_\_ was added in the exact version of Python in which I needed it and ended up writing a metaclass to do exactly that. Welp time to go in and change that code at work tomorrow lol.
I tried: ``` futures = [] failed = False # scrape and crawl with ThreadPoolExecutor(16) as executor: for number in range(1, 21): futures.append(executor.submit(run_process, number, output_filename)) wait(futures) ``` This took just about 67 seconds to complete. The multiprocessing example took 58. 
Haha, as if Python 2 will stop being used and debated after it's "deprecated"
Yeah I had high hope for rodeo, it was so promising especially once it was no longer linked with the browser and launched from the terminal (v2 I think) Y hat had a lot of promise for analysis in the python community I felt but all of their stuff just stagnated. Having said that, If you’re strictly doing analysis and not building complex jobs or doing more dev heavy work, rodeo is still pretty good as is. Spyder is a better option beyond that tho. 
https://github.com/krajj7/spectrogram All ready to go.
F-strings ftw
You might have a problem with the variable in the loop `str` its a keyword. Try using `string` . And I am not trying to be rude.
`__init_subclass__()` is honestly the best
It's already more technical than 90% blockchain bullshit!
Documentation and variable naming are not dumb enough. Remove all documentation and use Hungarian notation incorrectly and I'll invest.
Specifically the pro version, the community edition won't do this. You also have to activate it from memory. It's modelled after rstudio! highly recommend it
Guido doesn't run the show anymore.
&gt; I don't think it is a WHEN. Almost certainly it is. People want Python to be the hundred year language. The hundred year language handles concurrency better than python- I promise.
It's not just you. Pip hates all of us.
Jupyter notebook 
&gt; python 2.7 still had a better performance compared to anything &lt;= 3.5. This has always depended on workload, and still does. Also who said improvements had to be "cool" to be worth merit?
Are you sure? I just checked [https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/keyword-list](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/keyword-list) and it doesn't show p there. Or do you mean something else?
Yeah they were slightly off -- it's a built-in name, not a keyword. That means that it won't break your code to use it, but it's still bad practice
I particularly like that in the commit history of that file someone [tried to apply "simple is better than complex"](https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/d310f13cd2c321f0cca8429f611546c7888ae561#diff-678159c3315c1c120601176f007ee5ee) and the change was ["Back[ed] out per Raymond's request](https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/d310f13cd2c321f0cca8429f611546c7888ae561#diff-678159c3315c1c120601176f007ee5ee).
Thanks for your feedback! I'll add export features soon.
Good idea, thanks! I'll do this.
I notice that the parameter what_is_life is meaningless
umm, no?? &amp;#x200B; /s
Sounds like spyder would work pretty well. It comes with anaconda. Jupyter notebook comes with the anaconda distribution as well. 
You are opening a file in `send_email` that you never close. You should probably use the `with` statement to handle closing the file for you, e.g. ``` with open(filename, 'rb') as attachment: ... # do something with attachment ```
You're absolutely right.
Thank you for your help!
Not much but my first script calculates how many of each weight to put on the barbell in the gym. It had a massive bug all week that U couldn't figure out. Turned out that dividing a float by an integer, it rounds down the float, resulting in the wrong answer (even though the answer is a float). Not sure if this is a bug in python, or I'm just stupid. But I finally fixed it!!

The sentences are not yet perfect in [some](https://i.imgur.com/EutVoxL.png) cases &amp;#x200B;
Personally, I use both Spyder and Jupyter Notebook. The first is closer to RStudio in the UI and it's perfect for doing big computations and to work with large datasets. The latter is pefect if you need to produce some good looking report that you can later share as PDF or latex files. I prefer the first when running complex ML / NN models, the second to do more visually appealing exploratory analysis of datasets or to produce something to share with my team. 
But you are using a single CPU core here ;-) Try with ProcessPoolExecutor instead of ThreadPoolExecutor
I just uploaded v0.2.2 to PyPi, which includes a new `starmap` function, along with `starmapkw`. My previous example can now be condensed to this: ```python with ezpq.Queue() as Q: output = Q.starmap(function=sum_args, iterable=arg_list) ``` Thanks for the idea!
Same here. Sooner or later GIL has to go. This is especially relevant now when everysingle cpu out there is multi-core.
Breaking changes are alawase happening, but through deprication, rather than just break features instantly.
if we stayed in hex, 3.10 would come after 3.F
I would kill for an `__future__` import for f-strings in 2.7

I, for one, preferred treating everything not as ASCII as you're saying, but as byte strings. Because encodings suck. I feel like the only thing that changed in my code was the littering of .encode() and .decode() all over the place.
Pythonanywhere allows you to host python on the cloud. I used flask to build my own web app, it works great!
Point taken. Counterproposal: Base64
Vscode with python extension is now pretty good. Just missing variables explorer?

I want a python IDE that lets me execute code line(function) by line like Rstudio does. And no I don't want to use a notebook.
What's going wrong with if? Also you could write unit tests for debugging, I'm sure that would help :)
You could pick an ssh library, there is paramiko but it can be hard for beginners, there's a few modules that wrap it. You could also prob use subprocess.run depending on what you want the pi to do.
Because the patterns need to be language agnostic in our case. We save them in separate git modules that get imported by various apps in different languages (there will be a js version of this and we wanted to be able to write patterns only once - the original prototype had the patterns in .py files)
That's a very specific non-Python question, related to a specific library (which you do not mention). I would be surprised if anyone has an answer.
What would be the benefit of such a tool I'm curious
I'm using pycharm. It works great, but I have never tried any else except notepad++ 😜
We’ve had some trouble with celery (redis backend) in production that I wasn’t able to replicate. It’s probably something to do with our infrastructure but if you’re looking for high reliability (financial, medical, etc) make sure you’re using a solid message broker like Kafka
So I don't want to put doubt in your head but it's quite the rabbit hole you could be going down. Not to say its a bad one, I went down it and don't regret a thing! I just wanted to point out it's a big task you could be undertaking. So I went down the route of learning Django because I wanted to make quite big web apps but I know flask will probably do the trick. I also use Zappa to host my webapps on AWS. Pretty sure Zappa works with flask too. I'm currently making a web app that will allow someone to submit this GitHub repo and my automation will do all the hosting for you. It's not finished yet though!
Try PyCharm
Do you mean the Pro version plays nicer with Jupiter Notebook? 
PyCharm Community version can accomplish most of your requirements (1-4 and 6 definitely). I’m not sure about 5 - it does let you view and edit a notebook but you can’t execute the code cells, which kinda sucks IMO.
Regardless of IDE, please note that IPyhton is bettet suited for that task rather than the regular python interpreter

Taking a very fast look I'd say you have problems with **GetCompHand() GetPlayerHand().** In while loop you are referring to *playing* and *rannum*, but they are declared and "available" only inside the method. You also do not return them, you **PlayH** and **CompH**, but I do not see a use case for them either.
Post the errors, man. Help us help you. Also, this belongs in /r/learnpython 
Pycharm can fulfill all 6 requirements. You can also try Spyder, comes alongwith Anaconda
Those changes can be done before going over to python3 if you really wanted since python 2.7 is backwards compatible with 2.4 if you wanted to lessen the amount of change for the py2/3 transition. The last 2.4 version is over 10 years old IIRC. As I stated in my original comment about this: 10 years is a very reasonable time frame to plan upgrades.
You can use Pyro4 for that. https://pyro4.readthedocs.io/
Yhat has something called rodeo that is trying to be something similar to RStudio. You can also setup atom with some packages to be closer to and IDE as well as a notebook (helium). That being said I find myself using Jupiter lab 85% of the time to do analysis. Happy to give more info on my various setups!
So you only showed the last relevant experience? I'm struggling to make my resume one page and I think that would help but I would miss important information
JBaby811 it is definitely worth it. Knowing how to make some steps/processes faster due to programming can't be wrong. If you'll play with numbers, "numpy" is the best python library you can choose to work with. It's a great tool for data analysis. And you can use "matplotlib" to make your analysis visual. Best greetings
Python 3 may be superior as language but codebase matter too.
Umm, this is Python. We have *wheels*, not *gems.* Cheers.
I would guess you are using tensorflow. Try something like 12 epochs with a lowering training multiplier. Mostly you will try avoiding to overfit the model. Hence you often times only need to retrain your last layers, you probably will need less epochs. 
yes, yes i m using tensorflow thanks :)
Prefer to call then packages whole wheels is the better "python version of gems"
Exactly this solution. I knew I'd seen it before. I see, that I missed a few \[\] and did the for loop incorrectly when I tried something similar. Thank you!

Yeah, you can surely do it with flask. It's the easiest to use for the kind of project you are doing. For hosting, you can host it on your computer and the app would be accessible only when your computer is on and the flask server is started. So for an assignment it's an ok solution, you don't have to set up hosting on the Internet. If you go that route, you can set up a dynamic dns (eg. duckdns) so people can access your app through a url (like name.duckdns.org) instead of typing your ip address. I've done this exactly for a ML assignment I had, because the model I created was very large and needed more cpu power than I can get for free on web hosting, so I wanted to host it from my machine and it works great. 
On Linux, you can use inotify mechanism to watch for write-close events on a directory (files within it) and react to them. It works best with Maildir structure. For mbox, you can just hang at the end of the mail file and wait for data. I do not know how to monitor directories for changes on Windows and MacOSX, but I suspect some sort of mechanism exists there. You can also fetch mail directly from IMAP, do what you need to do and store results in Maildir or mbox for your mail client to use. 
Thanks for your comment! Unfortunately, this doesn't change anything for me. list.copy() has the same result. You can try it yourself with this easier code: import math class Game(): def __init__(self, width = 7, height = 7): self.X_matrix = [[[0 for _ in range(width)] for _ in range(height)]] self.O_matrix = [[[0 for _ in range(width)] for _ in range(height)]] self.width = width self.height = height self.ended = False self.winner = -1 self.active_player = 0 # X always begins def draw(self): fields = [[[" " for _ in range(self.width)] for _ in range(self.height)] for _ in range(len(self.X_matrix))] for i in range(len(self.X_matrix)): fields[i] = [["X" if self.X_matrix[i][x][y] else fields[i][x][y] for y in range(self.width)] for x in range(self.height)] fields[i] = [["O" if self.O_matrix[i][x][y] else fields[i][x][y] for y in range(self.width)] for x in range(self.height)] for field in fields: print(" " + "".join(["-" for _ in range(self.width)]) + " ") for x in range(self.height): print("|", end='') for y in range(self.width): print(field[x][y], end='') print("|") print(" " + "".join(["-" for _ in range(self.width)]) + " ") def get_state(self): return self.X_matrix + \ self.O_matrix + \ [[self.active_player for _ in range(self.width)] for _ in range(self.height)] def set_state(self, state): turn = math.floor(len(state)) self.X_matrix = state[0:turn-1] self.O_matrix = state[turn:(2*turn)-1] self.width = len(self.X_matrix[0][0]) self.height = len(self.X_matrix[0]) self.ended, self.winner = self.evaluate() self.active_player = state[2*turn][0][0] def evaluate(self): # TODO: Actually implement ended = False winner = -1 return ended, winner def place(self, coords): x, y = coords if self.X_matrix[-1][x][y]: raise ValueError("Error while trying to place an {} at ({}|{}): There is an X already!"\ .format("O" if self.active_player else "X", x, y)) if self.O_matrix[-1][x][y]: raise ValueError("Error while trying to place an {} at ({}|{}): There is an X already!"\ .format("O" if self.active_player else "X", x, y)) # Copy last turns board state self.X_matrix.append(self.X_matrix[-1][:]) self.O_matrix.append(self.O_matrix[-1][:]) # Place marker if self.active_player: self.O_matrix[-1][x][y] = 1 else: self.X_matrix[-1][x][y] = 1 # End turn self.ended, self.winner = self.evaluate() self.active_player = int(not self.active_player) This is an unfinished connect5 game similar to the tic-tac-toe one. Load it up in a python interpreter and do the following: g = Game() g.draw() g.place((1,1)) g.draw() Here I am using the list[:] way to copy it, but it doesn't work. You can change it to use list.copy(), but on my machine that also does not copy the list but just the reference. I'm on Python 3.7.2 x64 on Windows 10 1803.

They have extra functionality like pandas dataframe inspector 
First, it seems to me that colour is just another attribute. Is there a particular reason you think it needs to be handled separately? Second, think about how each attribute affects the price. Does the presence of that attribute add a percentage to the overall price, or maybe just a given amount? If so, you really just need one formula that checks for the presence of each attribute and adjusts the price accordingly. After checking each possible attribute, you arrive at a final price. 
I just figured out why it’s called *wheels*. So you don’t have to reinvent them. 
It calculates how many of each size weight to put on each end of a barbell. The benefit is that you don't have to do (n - 20)/2 in your head every time you change weights on a barbell. The calculation isn't hard to do in your head, but when you've been lifting heavy, it's hard to focus. If you make a mistake, it can mean lifting too light or perhaps injury. Many apps come with this functionality built-in. I thought I'd make a library in python to do it. Probably not useful on its own because nobody is going to run Python scripts in the gym, but maybe someone will use it one day for their app.
Nice, looks great!
First actual project I've written in python, a fman / Norton commander filemanager clone because I wanted to get familiar with pyside [source here](https://github.com/wmute/evo2) [gif of the app](https://imgur.com/a/6LnXpHk) Comments on the code quality / tips / and so on are very welcome.

Again, if that's your concern clearly we should have all kept using Fortran instead of moving away from it, because codebase right? Times change. 
I thought external packages come in wheels. This is coming from a built-in package. So is this than still the right way to call it?

Python is very much widely used at present. It is used in various application like software development, web development . Python biggest application is in the field of Data Science as it overthrow R after the introduction of Django . Most of the programming [concept in data science](http://pythonandmltrainingcourses.com/courses/best-data-science-training-in-delhi/) is done with python. The main reason why Python is prefer than other programming language is because of it simple syntax, easy to code, user friendly, variety of libraries available . Because of all its specification Python has become one of the most important Programming language of today. For knowing more on the application of Python you can take a look on [Quora answer.](https://www.quora.com/Why-is-Python-a-language-of-choice-for-data-scientists/answer/Raj-Shivakoti)

Common interview question I ask is to implement an is_anagram function. Which returns true if one input string could be rearranged to be the same as the other input string. I've always implemented it, by essentially building what Counter does and then just comparing the dictionaries to eachother. And this is the optimal solution I would lead candidates toward. I had no idea Counter existed. I had a candidate last week and asked if he could use anything from standard lib. I said sure and he one linered it. collections.Counter(s1) == collections.Counter(S2)
Very cool, thanks for sharing.
It's called stealing.
I use coverage, docs, pypi, and build status. I’ve very rarely seen anything else used.
You can define s custom colormap.
66 seconds with ProcessPoolExecutor.
Am I missing something or is this the same as ‘’’’set(x) == set(y) and len(x) == len(y)’’’’ ? Obviously this is more verbose but I’ve never uh.. [en]countered that function before
it literally says that on the page, yes :)
Nope! Yours gives true for aabc and abcc But close
Yeah I edited it just as you were replying, what about the second option though?
Why not do this? ``` sorted(s1) == sorted(s2) ```
That's the other good solution! And actually the first one I gave when I first heard the problem. That's an O(n log n) solution, while counter is O(n)
Wow. I've been looking for some really good DRY style coding practices for Python for quite some time now. Honestly, it looks really solid (and SOLID, too. hehehe.) Nice work!
Thanks! I glad you like it.
&gt; very un-PEP-08 To this day, I still struggle with following PEP-8. Some decisions were very intelligent, while other choices I truly feel were bad decisions. Personally, I still follow PEP-8 as closely as possible for the sake of my team and anyone else who might read my code. Bending/ignoring PEP-8 in this case makes sense to me.
can you explain a bit more about pywinauto on how it can locate elements on programs on pc better than pyautogui for example, thanks!
I have no problem maxing out 128 core servers with Python. Code is very simple, no concurrency Gotchas. Only thing I lose over say a Java language is I waste a lot of memory (due to multi-processing it up the wazoo), but for a lot of use cases we have absurd amounts of memory just sitting there. I can't even use 50% of my servers memory even with Python.
Thanks for the OOP wiki! You can use whatever name you like instead of `I`. There is a [faq entry about it](https://stories.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html#can-i-use-self-instead-of-i-argument). We need to include import statements for sure.
Timsort, in worst case scenarios, is O(n lg n), which you're doing on both strings. Counting is O(n) time for each as well as O(m) space (with the caveat that lookups in whatever you're using to count could become O(m) where m the size of your character set). If someone used the sorted == sorted answer in an interview, but described it's shortcomings with asymptotic growth, but argued that with most "normal" length strings lg n difference wasn't a huge issue, I'd probably buy it as long as they could explain the other way. Although if they could explain it the other way I'd probably ask them to write it up just to verify their understanding.
That's weird, when testing both with timeit, Counter is a \_lot\_ slower \`\`\`&gt;&gt;&gt; timeit("Counter(s1) == Counter(s2)", "from \_\_main\_\_ import s1, s2, Counter", number=100\_000) 0.9097462999999948 \&gt;&gt;&gt; timeit("sorted(s1) == sorted(s2)", "from \_\_main\_\_ import s1, s2, Counter", number=100\_000) 0.23151730000000725\`\`\`
Haha. I have actually helped this website by bringing it to their notice that their API is actually vulnerable and makes their pricing plans pointless. If not me, many other ppl might be using the API this way. Maybe after seeing this video, their devs will try to make their API more secure. Till then, its carrots in open. Feel free to have them as salad. ;)
It's called showing how your stuff can be stolen and you should try better methods to protect it. :)
Sorted does some cheating because it's implemented at a much lower level underneath. Not in python. Big O notation deals with asymptotic time complexity, which is how the time of the function grows as the input size grows. If you make the strings big enough, eventually counter will be faster. 
Pywinauto uses microsoft api's to locate the elements. The best tool to inspect the elements is microsoft's inspect.exe, which comes with windows sdk.
Yeah, someone else commented that `sorted(s1) == sorted(s2)` works. Which is an O(n log n) solution. 
Yes performance does depend on workload but for most common use cases python 2.7 was either better or lagged by very little. The point is that the difference was nowhere as significant as with 3.6/3.7. "Cool" in this context means features that are sufficiently interesting for an average developer so that it is worth the trouble of backporting or looking for other packages. It needs a critical number of these cool features (and of course support in other libraries) for a developer to consider a change that involves a nontrivial amount of work on their part.
Yeah, just noticed that after the strings become larger than a hundred characters Counter will take the speed advantage. Thanks for explaining! 
&gt;I am though sick and tired of the “let’s crap on 2” mentality that the community loves to do (not everyone— I know). That mentality doesn’t exist. most people here don’t like writing Python 2 code anymore because Python 3.4+ is better and has been along for a while. So if some one has to write Python 2 today, they’re annoyed that they can’t have the peace of mind that Python 3’s sting models would bring, or the async capabilites that are so much better than the implicit hacks that are gevent and so on. We’re all very aware that Python 2.7 was a great, historically significant release, but it needs do retire now with the Python 2.x branch it’s the last version of.
Here's the code, if interested -&gt; https://github.com/calebpollman/web-scraping-parallel-processing/blob/master/script_futures.py I don't know much about concurrent.futures, but it is nice that you can cancel and check the status of the jobs. However, since I don't really need those features for this use case, I wonder how much of the overhead is slowing things down? In other words, if you care about canceling jobs, etc. then go with futures otherwise go with multiprocessing?

Hopefully its not too hard for teams to migrate their code base to python3 ;)
The knowledge here is useful for a lot of people, however, I feel like you could have picked a less potentially illegal place to show off this kind of know-how. Super useful stuff to know, bad way to show it 
Well, to be fair, what make python good for science is rarely in the standard library, and the standard library is what it is for a lot of historical reasons. It is a hodge podge of functions as it was created before the internet was that widespread and packages where not even a thing. Because of backward compatibility changing API is really hard. So "fixing" it is a really tough nut to crack. As whatever you do you'll displease someone, the status-quo often wins. You'll see that in practice the CS "Correctness" is rarely the only ting that counts. I agree that in this case, not admitting that difflib has a surprising default behavior is a hard to swallow pill. But I believe you sticking to the problem, and coming here several month after several month show that you have some qualities to bee good in the software which is persistency. Either find a better solution and contribute to it; make it even better, go at meetup, conferences, and present a 10 min talk as to why difflib is broken and why use a better alternative. If this project does not exist, well you likely have the skills to start it. Most of all, think about your mental health, find a way that won't make you angry, or it will eat you. 
You're describing C++. It would have been a great language if they decided to break backwards compatibility, but as it stands now it's a monstrosity.

It’s best practice to keep your source code outside of the virtualenv directory. You will have to reinstall any packages installed with pip.
Yup, there it is at the bottom, haha thanks
The code I have already written. But that was the wrong question to ask. Should I just delete the venv folder and recreate a virtualenv? What flag do I use to specify the version of Python?
&gt; a less potentially illegal place what are less "potentially illegal" places in your opinion?
Is your code inside your virtualenv? If so, move it outside. Then you can create a new virtualenv by running something like `python3.7 -m venv my_virtualenv` - the version of Python inside the virtualenv will be the version of Python you used to create it.

Yes, once I was present at an interview were someone asked the anagram question. Later I presented my colleagues with this Python solution and they were quite impressed. But to be fair, they didn't knew Python as good as I did at the time.

When I run the command 'which python', in my virtual environment, I get venv/bin/python ... instead of venv/bin/python3.7
Is this a problem? `venv/bin/python` should be a symlink to the correct version of Python, i.e. 3.7.
`venv/bin/python` and the others are just symlinks to the python binary that created the venv. So in a venv created with python3.7, the `venv/bin/python` symlink will point to python3.7.
This is a perfect example: https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/b0j97i/my_another_video_on_discovering_hidden_apis_on/ Literally a video on stealing higher tier access on paid services.

You better be scared of the devs who build your website and leave such loopholes. Its beyond my understanding why you would be scared of someone who exposes the vulnerability in your website?
wtf?
`python3 -m venv --upgrade &lt;venv&gt;` See \`--upgrade\` in the venv [docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html). (since python3.3) &amp;#x200B;
That's the latest version that's available in the repositories for your version of Ubuntu. Ubuntu does not always ship the newest software and does not do major upgrades during a release's lifetime. Upgrade to the latest Ubuntu, or get a separate Python 3.7 install, e.g. from [deadsnakes](https://launchpad.net/~deadsnakes/+archive/ubuntu/ppa).
The latest version of Python and the latest version of python available in the repository for this particular distribution are different things. This is where the confusion comes from i guess.
Sorry I'm missing the context here.
It's not here to do your homeworked. Also, a better place for this question is /r/learnpython. Also, the answer can be found trivially on Google or via the subreddit search.

It's one thing to report a vulnerability, it's another to make a video showing everyone how to exploit it and incentivizing people to do so.

Is your goal to have a dashboard, or is your goal to learn from the experience of creating a dashboard in python? If the former, I concur with u/PrettyChillScientist and their suggestion of MagicMirror2. Its a nodejs backend with the frontend running javascript in the browser. If the latter, perhaps still look at Magic Mirror, but figure out how to implement the backend in python.
They should indeed learn, specially so they don't make this kind of mistakes on their own websites, but telling people they don't need to pay because it's ok to steal, which is what you do in the video, makes you a terrible person. It would also be trivial to show how to do this in a demo website instead of using a live service. You just wanted to brag and enlarge your ego, because you're a very sad and terrible person. Stop being like that, become a grown up, be responsible. 
This guy isn't even realising what you're trying to tell him.
They have instructions here https://docs.spyder-ide.org/installation.html You can install using pip (scroll down a bit)
Try pygame, on they have a bunch of games that people submitted on their site too. Download and read the source code for these or try the pygame tutorial. PySDL2 is another option.

Why isn't this the top comment...
That's a good example.
Trying to make a game engine on top of PyGame.
Don't uninstall 3.5, though. System tools depend on it, and might break if you remove it.
Well in the video, I have just shown that the website is asking you to pay for a simple feature (download audio as mp3) which can be implemented with help of some programming knowledge. If a website is asking you to pay for something which is **not worth** it, its better to reverse engineer it.
As far games are concerned, there are a few things you should be aware of. First off, limit your scope. I want you to really put an emphasis on this because it is a massive pitfall for all developers, new or experienced alike. If you're gonna create a game as a one man project you probably want to avoid MMOs, large scale open world games etc. Personally I recommend creating a text based game, those are pretty simple. 2D games work too for one man projects. Second, there will be things you HATE doing. The games industry is a very vast field, moreso when youre the one doing the legwork. This is normal. However if you end up disliking working on the project that probably means the project itself is too broad. Third, make a minimum viable product. Basically a minimum viable product is a test build that covers only the most important things that your game needs to work (i.e movement, ability to deal damage etc). Using a list that shows the minimum viable product is huge for making progress. You can sort out all the details later. Now where is my damn coffee. 
Pypi is called "the cheese shop" which ties in with u/steven_h's answer. It's a Monty Python joke. 
I haven't seen the video but security by obfuscation never works. Your stance is actually the opposite of what security community sees as the correct approach. See Google Project Zero. It is usual to first contact the website and report the issue and then given a certain time frame disclose it publicly for obvious reasons. Also toy examples are like hello world programs. For lots of intents and purposes not useful enough.
bash + python3 + pip + vi is all you need :)
What do you think is sketchy in this video? The website was showing you the output but not letting you download it even when the data had already been fetched (basically not allowing user to download file as mp3). So we call the API directly through our python program so that output can be saved as mp3. Now the point of this video is to show that it's possible to do this by just some inspection. If the website is sensible enough, it will try to protect the service on which it is charging money. In the end, this video serves as a lesson for 2 type of ppl: 1. Users: do not pay where you do not need to. Learn some programming. 2. Websites: at least have sense to protect API which you are trying to sell
You are encouraging users to "steal whatever they can". If you don't understand the difference or why it is sketchy, then you are only proving my point.
I don't see where have I defended security by obfuscation. Project Zero gives the owners 90 days to address the issue which is completely different. I'm not against disclosing publicly, I'm against doing it this way and incentivizing people to steal.
Haha man, this is always hilarious: \&gt; Led the development of a team of 5 people to consistently reduce overall technical strategy by running 30 million in sales in 2014 and 2016
There are 100s of such websites. How many would I report to? Just half an hour before, I found another such website which asked me to pay for a service whose API was clearly visible. Does that mean one should not use them? Or should I not let other ppl know that there is a way to actually "hack" such sites?
Yes, as I stated in the very end. \~10% worse performance.
Sure, just give me some time to survive some exams.
Counter has much more cool features: https://articles.life4web.ru/eng/python-counter/
"good faith" is not a point here. The point is that there are 100s of websites in open which are asking you to pay money for the services which are actually freely available due to unprotected APIs. What should be done with such websites? PS: There is no point reporting them bcoz their devs already know that the API is unprotected. They are just relying on **security through obscurity** Let me know your views on this.
Incidentally, self is not itself a reserved keyword. It is only used by convention. You can use a different word there if you want, as it is merely a positional argument. You could even use this.
I already let you know my views on it. You are acting in poor faith by stealing things the site has intended you to pay for. The poor practices they use do not justify theft. That is a poor moral choice on your end. They require the service to be paid for, you intentionally avoid paying for it by doing sketchy shit that you justify in the name of "security not good". It's a dick move.
thanks again! does it works like pyautogui where it finds the position relative to the screen? what if i need to use multiple programs in the code, does it have an option to open programs by its 'pid' and then click on the screen position? is there a better way to locate programs elements on windows? thanks so much for sharing from your experience :)
Places where you don't pay for the service you are giving instructions on how to steal
Ok. So if I really want to use that service and I know that there exists a simple API to use that, should I still pay in your opinion? PS: I'm not arguing but really interested to understand your viewpoint. It helps.
You definitely don't let other people know. There is a well-understood, professional bug/vulnerability disclosure process you should research and follow: &amp;#x200B; 1) Report the vulnerability to the company privately. Provide an indepth description of how you found this vulnerability and how it impacts their business. &amp;#x200B; 2) Wait for some time and keep checking the API. If the vulnerability is still there, and your report has not been acknowledged for **at least weeks**, then you think about something more drastic like disclosing it publicly. &amp;#x200B; You can spin it any way you want, but your current method is theft.
I don't see how I could make it any clearer how I feel about this. It is time for you to answer my questions: 1. Is it okay to steal ice from the unlocked cooler outside convenience stores? 2. Is it okay to steal a bike you see sitting outside unlocked? 3. Is it okay to steal an unlocked car warming up with keys in it in somebodies driveway?
Wow thanks a lot, there were a lot of things i wanted to know and this cleared most of it. And here you go ☕️. And Since you seem quite knowledgeable, do you have any tips or where i could start for making normal programs, or are you mainly gaming-related?
Ends up with the wrong kind of python as well.
If I have understood correctly, pyautogui uses image recognition to locate elements. Pywinauto interacts with the elements through the api so they dont always even have to be visible (it is best to have them visible though). Yes, with pywinauto you can connect to the window and then for example call maximize() to maximize a specific window. Inspect the elements with inspect.exe, learn how to locate them and then learn how to click, set text or read values from them. Look into their docs, there are some examples for notepad etc if I remember correctly, and try it.
These are serious situations. Check this comment again: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/b0j97i/my\_another\_video\_on\_discovering\_hidden\_apis\_on/eifujqy](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/b0j97i/my_another_video_on_discovering_hidden_apis_on/eifujqy) The website is asking you to pay to just download an mp3 file. The video only aims to show that it is plausible to do so that without paying any money. Thats the whole point of video. I'm not encouraging users to "steal whatever they can". I'm encouraging users to learn how to inspect websites so that they do not have to pay where they do not need to. I do not have anything else to say.
No problem dude. I mostly work with gaming related stuff, so i dont know if I can help you outside of that field. If you have the money, consider getting a minor or major in compsci, those are very useful and in high demand.
Stop pushing your agenda and answer a question, huh? You are actively avoiding saying anything that would contradict with you defending the fact that you are stealing and doing so by refusing to answer anything asked of you. It doesn't matter if the API is protected or not. If using it requires you to pay the provider based on their policy, then not doing so is stealing. It is very simple. For the third time now, answer a damn question: 1. Is it okay to steal ice from the unlocked cooler outside convenience stores? 2. Is it okay to steal a bike you see sitting outside unlocked? 3. Is it okay to steal an unlocked car warming up with keys in it in somebodies driveway?
You can extend that to a multi-word solution, too. To see if a word is _contained_ inside another, use `&amp;` to get the intersection of the two dictionaries and compare it to the child: ``` &gt; food = Counter('food') &gt; foo = Counter('foo') &gt; food &amp; foo == foo True ``` Then you can use subtraction to get the leftover letters: ``` &gt; food - foo Counter({'d': 1}) ``` You can make a recursive algorithm: - For word in wordlist, see if word is an anagram of the target. If so, you're done! - If not, see if the word is contained in the target. If not, skip it. - If it is, subtract the word from the target and recurse with that as the new target. - If you run out of words, quit.
Foreign applicants may apply as well. All contact occurs with students on the platform via the messaging system and a whiteboard w/ video feed for online tutoring.
Provide the vulnerability report to the developers. It is not okay to provide the report to the public unless it is a danger to the public and the developers have refused to do anything about it.
You sure are a presumptuous cunt
They should learn. But not via a video released to the public instructing people on how to exploit it.
FTFY &gt;If a website is asking you to pay for something which is not worth it, its better to **steal** it.
You should definitely not use it. It is against the terms of service and likely costing the developers money. You should report it to the developers like any good human being should. You should definitely not spread the information around on how to screw the developers by encouraging people to steal from them.
Ding dong your opinion is wrong!
So you are one of those devs, huh? Or are you incapable of reading?
what if it's not built-in windows program but a 3rd one, will it still works the same way? thanks :)
All of them you cunt
I do not understand.
Why for Android development python is not in top most priority.
It works with most programs, even 3rd party ones. But it always depends on the program, to make sure you need to check it with inspect.exe. I have been able to fully automate numerous 3rd party business programs. It may seem hard at first but I have always found a way to click, write or read any element. There is always a workaround.
That would be nice. Don't miss this under-appreciated project: [enaml-native](https://github.com/codelv/enaml-native/).
ok that's great to hear though as a beginner i'll probably won't come up instantly with 'workarounds' so i'll ping you if i'll stuck somewhere if you don't mind :)
&gt; for example, I could use a list to hold a priority counter for a log to be processed. Or a dictionary to hold a lookup of users. I wanted to know what real world examples people encounter Day to day to allow me to wrap my head around when or when not to use a list as opposed to a dictionary. This is exactly what I am also looking for.
dry-python any relation to dry-rb ?
&gt; Let’s consider common troubles you meat in development. meat. : )
That is the latest version in the Canonical repos. If you want a later (or just different) version, you can use something like pyenv or pipenv to download and compile a new version.
Thanks! Fixed.

Qa is a bit niche,maybe better for a later role after some devops or data engineering. I feel you'd learn the most from devops at an earlier stage, but correct me if I'm wrong. I'm new to this shit
I took some inspiration from it when I started the \`stories\` library.
Emoji are a fucking plague
I didn't know about this until a couple months ago and I was like, oh, the things I could've done easier! Another class from `collections` I didn't discover until recently is `defaultdict`. It can save you a lot of trouble.
Nothing about the article ?
I'm scared of not having strong enough foundations, so my instinct tells me to get the ones who are tied to testing if i can &amp; learn more on the job, but yes I don't want to be boxed into a certain position that might be difficult to grow out of.
Oh my bad, thought that by QA you meant quantitative analyst. If you're still in uni and these are internships send a few applications for each out and see what you get I say. Devops for me seems like the most interesting, but that's personal preference
His comment was about the article. In terms of his mention of alternate packages, maybe you should have a paragraph (or four) describing the different options a developer has before going into `uwsgi` specifically. In terms of his comments on the site, I agree that links to external packages should be links to external packages. If you want to use same-site tags, keep them relegated to a footer or sidebar. 
I am not Bulgaria but do you have youtube links to your other talks?

Yeah it's Quality Assurance. I'm self learner actually, i'm not great at bash/*nix &amp; quite zero experience with CI/CD frameworks. I'm not too scared about having to learn &amp; deal with those than the fact that I have weak foundations about CS overall, which might lead to dead ends.

The thumbnail makes me feel catfished
OP was initially right in their criticism, the EDIT was added after their reply.
I know people who are solutions developers with weak cs background, just took information systems at uni. They use .net and one of the C languages can't remember which. You can do it! Apply your ass off and hope for the best. Personally I'm gonna take a boot camp after the cfa exam so I can specialize in fintech type stuff or Quant stuff. If you have another background see what you can do with it and have a sweet spot! Fintech companies hate the fact that their coders don't know shit about finance and that makes me (generally) more attractive to them if I do the boot camp. If you can find a sweetspot it'll differentiate you above and beyond
Listen when I applied,they opened that page and told to share that link. I am not getting anything. Later when some1 told that the Registration link isn't clear,I added a comment with proper link. Took a bit of time to get that link as I was logged in and couldn't access that page.so searched in incognito tab. 
i really hope i can succeed in getting into the development industry. i pivoted out of my field of work because it sucks, the pool of opportunity was small to begin with, the people in it had no appreciation of tech despite they need it to survive &amp; the industry kept declining since 2000s. other than becoming sales person or something stupid like that it's hopeless there :(
That's great on you man for taking initiative! Wish you all the best. I'll be there with you in a years time I hope
I think you'll do great, you sound like you have a lot of energy! Keep chasing your goal, &amp; best luck.
Internal links are a personal choice and if you don't like it is your personal point of view, I'm sure in your website you have a lot of external links. I mentioned in the Preface that official [uWSGI Plugin Python 3](https://www.paulox.net/2019/03/13/how-to-use-uwsgi-with-python-3-7-in-ubuntu-18-x/#preface) use Python 3.6 and this is the main motivation for me to write the article. I don't use uwsgi or pyuwsgi from PyPi in my daily flow but I use the official uwsgi package and I described how I compiled a uwsgi python plugin with python 3.7 This article is an Howto about my solution and not an essay on uWSGI, you can read the official documentation if you don't like my flow or write your own article.
I this your comments here are the real spam. I spent time writing an article on a specific way to use uwsgi with python3.7 and I shared it and your comments was about something not related to the content of the article: emoji, internal link, other way to use uwsgi. If you are really interested in the subject try the steps in the article and write a comment about them, otherwise you are wasting your time, my time and time of other users.
As I wrote in other comments my article was clearly an Howto to build an uWSGI plugin for Python 3.7 and I write in the title and in the subtitle, so your comment about missing paragraphs is useless. I don't think you can say if I have to put internal link in footer or other section, maybe you can decide in your website. Another comment totally unrelated to the content of the article.

I totally disagree , as I developer i prefer short howto with real solution on it and not long article with nothing inside, like your comments.

That's cool and all but who is actually using the latest Pyhton day to day? We are still on 2.7.
You both are wrong, you can't call his critique *a spam*, the best you could is call that *a trolling.* And he's wrong because your article belongs here regarding all the rules and best practices - that disqualified it from being a spam.
Listen dude, you chose to post here. I was completely fair in my comment. If you're unable to receive criticism then maybe you should find another place to post. &gt;Another comment totally unrelated to the content of the article. "maybe you should have a paragraph (or four) describing the different options a developer has before going into uwsgi specifically" Yes, my comment about how you should flesh out your reason for using `uwsgi` and perhaps show (or at least mention alternatives) is totally unrelated to your article about using `uwsgi`. You are totally correct. 
I would say QA is your best bet. 
Thank goodness it's not my comments that are up for feedback, then. There's a strong argument to be made that it's dangerous to present ideas to developers without offering _some_ insight into how things work. This leads to the spread of antipatterns, misuse of tools, and generally crappy code. And honestly, if you can't take some criticism about the substance of your post (or lack thereof), why even post to a public forum like Reddit? Maybe keep the discussion to a comments section where you can moderate the discussion to include what you deem to be appropriate feedback.

Sadly not a lot of choices, Python is just a programming language. Knowing HOW to program is a different beast entirely. It is like learning how to use a few tools in your garage and now you want to rebuild an engine. My advice, find an internship if you really think you can go down this path. Otherwise, find a bootcamp with connections to real jobs if you don't want to study CS. Not saying this to be harsh, just putting this out there: My 14 year old goddaughter programs in Python now thanks to an after school class, a summer coding "camp" and a learning center that teaches programming. Learning a programming language is not that big of a deal anymore. It is kind of expected with most I.T. jobs or at least script/API writing. Maybe try an entry level position like help desk and automate some tasks with python? 
This is brilliant lol

# Disclaimer As can be deduced from the title, I posted a link to an Howto, to use uWSGI with a specific version of Python and specific versions of Ubuntu. The main goal is to describe a specific process to use this software and the main audience are developer that already know uWSGI and use it with Python and Ubuntu and I appreciated comment about the step I decide to share with other developers. If you don't know anything about uWSGI, Python or Ubuntu it's not an article for you, you can find official documentation and long articles for beginner about this topics but it is not my intention to write an article of this type. If you use another flow with this technology you can find article about different approach or you can write an article about it and share the url here. Last but not least, if you want comments about something totally unrelated to the real content of the article (e.g. emoji, seo, UX, html, etc ...) you are totally free to do it but do not pretend that they will be well accepted. Actually constructive criticisms are welcome.
Are you using an older python? Just a wild guess is that the ordered dict gets dict'd down the line. Newer cpythons (3.6+) have ordered dictionaries by default (probably not part of spec though).
It'd help a lot to know which version of Ubuntu you were running. But assuming it's a modern one, try `apt install python3.7`. It's there in the repo, it's just not the default for `python3`. You can run it by explicitly running `python3.7`. Ubuntu has no problem with multiple versions of Python installed on the same system.
I'm not sure what this is supposed to represent. Is it upvotes vs downvotes on posts over the times of the day? Is time represented by UTC? Do Yes, NO mean upvote downvote?
That info (data source and timezone) should probably (definitely) be on the chart.
It ( OrderedDict) works perfect on data just not working on head, so I do not think there is anything relate to python version. &amp;#x200B; Or do you have a working script for python 3.6+?
Yes, and thanks for your comments.
I have the same question. Also, given the data numbers involved, using an increment other than steps of 20 might make it easier to establish what the number is.
It doesn't have immediate consequences in enterprise or education, but it can for personal projects. Even then it shows what's coming down the line or could be backported. It's rarely relevant, but when it is, it is extremely important.
Of the past 5K posts, 40 were posted at 3pm UTC, and of those less than ten had 10 points or more. Although that doesn't really add up; post count only comes up to ~1,000 posts.
Activate from memory?
Thank you for sharing, your timing is absurdly good!
I have Automate The Boring Stuff with Python. I really like that book :) &amp;#x200B;
ah man I wish I could edit the title
Which timezone?
How hard is networking in python? Just apply for a job you don't even need to network 
Because CPython has little to no ARM support? Can't easily use an interpreted language when the machine-code-flavor of the interpreter barely or shittily exists. There's Jython and PyPy, but those are relatively small projects.
I use a fancy commits counter too, and all the badges mentioned by /u/billsil. The only ones I use extra are two badges from lgtm. Can be seen here in the README: [https://github.com/Laurentiu-Andronache/he](https://github.com/Laurentiu-Andronache/he)
My pleasure. Glad it may be of some help!
Violent python was published in 2012 looks like. Are the examples still relevant and will it play nice (easy to convert the examples) to the latest versions of python?
I like how you made the plot in R on a oythin subreddit 😂. Pretty sure that is a ggplot plot
I watched the full video waiting for them to throw the ball..
It's plotnine [according to OP](https://reddit.com/r/Python/comments/b0qgkn/_/eigdx55/?context=1)
Not sure what you mean. Python is not a requirement for my job, but networking is.
Python is one of the perfect tools for system analyst, however it works better if you also know bash script and power shell.
Why not use praw instead?
Check out that spike around lunch.
No that's so R project 
Ahh basically a clone of ggplot in R for python. Cool stuff!
Throw it already 
No, it was only a guess. The data just gets serialized and requests or anything doesn't have to care about them. But headers are manipulated for various reasons (encodings, auth, multiparts, size, ...) so it's possible your ordered dict gets converted to something else. And if it's a dict, new python might help. It's also entirely possible the underlying libraries in C do wild things and requests or you have no control over it.
I think so. The book is a great introduction to some really powerful modules. The examples showcase neat things you can do that you might not have thought about. The emphasis is on infosec and penetration testing, but should be relevant for anyone who thinks security is important.
Just finished tutorial about decorators and this helped me understand better how to actually use them. Thanks!

&gt; A finally clause is always executed before leaving the try statement ... The finally clause is also executed “on the way out” when any other clause of the try statement is left via a break, continue or return statement. https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html Seems pretty clear cut to me. The whole idea is that it's for performing important cleanup work that you don't want to be missed on accident.

'add' needs to be a string. When you write if operation == add, python is looking for a variable called add. Instead, write this: if operation == 'add'
you never define a variable named add

Wii remote obviously Arduino with a thing I wrote to take in serial data and drive from it. You could also use firmata. Pi running a python script that uses a library called cwiid that then sends the serial data. Motor controller wired into 4 motors and then wires into the arduino. One anker usb battery pack and one regular battery pack. 
Bad wording, soz. You need to set PyCharm to operate in Scientific Mode, it's under View &gt; Scientific Mode but it is only available in Pro edition. But you can get this version for free if you're a student and I think through github student package too.
Have you used Kali Linux for penetration testing? I have a 2011 MacBook Pro, and am looking to expand my skillset.. Any tips would be helpful
I dont think PyCharm interacts or uses jupiter notebooks at all. If you have the Pro version, select Scientific Mode from the View menu. It's looks nearly identical to Rstudio. I personally don't like notebooks, I use them sometimes in Rstudio but as the default behavior of writing scripts? Weird.

nice. im learning python with "python crash course" &amp;#x200B;
Could you perhaps explain how these books have been helpful to you? Checking my Humble Bundle library, I got those three books as eBooks (along with some other Python books) and I currently got a study going on where I learned the basic principles of programming through Python. Using Python for assignments, I would love to enhance my Python-knowledge further besides the books my university recommend to us. So I wouldn't mind knowing how these books specifically helped you. :) Might be worth a read then.
That's good to know! thanks
nice ide!
That seems like an arbitrary distinction that you're making, and the language spec doesn't. When the try block terminates, the finally block executes. Simple as that. It doesn't matter what caused the termination or where it came from. The feature is designed to be simple and consistent, so you can easily rely on it.
That is how the generator works. maybe this helps you understand it def f1(): i = -1 try: for i in range(10): print("f1", i) yield i finally: print("f1 finally", i) def f2(): for i in f1(): if i == 5: break if __name__ == "__main__": f2() &amp;#x200B;
for loop does that in this case. It'll reach yield on the first iteration and will call next again. At this point finally will be executed and next will raise StopIteration as generator function has finished.
Lol these were in a row on my home page from your other post on Raspi
&gt;String ordering might have been somewhat intuitive (most of us learned alphabetical ordering before Python), but tuple ordering doesn’t often feel quite as intuitive at first. This is precisely why I'd shy away from using it (explicit &gt; implicit). It works perfectly fine at first but then you get bugs from ambiguous corner cases like, for instance: (1, 2, 0) &gt; (1, 2)
/r/petthedamndog
&gt; When the try block terminates Please explain how the `try` block is terminated
ok, thanks.
The try block contains a generator. The generator terminated. Therefore the try has terminated.
The generator object itself goes out of scope, and a finally is pending so must be handled.
comtypes and win32 libraries are the way to go on this
I understand how generator works, thanks. There's obviously a difference when you stop a generator by itself, and just stops calling `next` from outside.
Do you have a project related to this feature ?
I just stopped calling `next`. There is no line of code that says terminate generator.
Violent python, eh?
Yes, that is what I found out. The key here is that it terminates when it's out of scope.
If you're looking to get started with Python and networking, Kirk Byers has a great free intro course at the link below. Don't worry about the old date there, just get on the mailing list. He's currently got one going on right now. It's a weekly mailing list based course. He recommends having at least a LITTLE bit of Python experience, but it's not required. &amp;#x200B; [https://pynet.twb-tech.com/email-signup.html](https://pynet.twb-tech.com/email-signup.html)
&gt;so I do not think there is anything relate to python version. I think it probably will - ordered dicts will be passed down through the stack and at some point converted to a regular dict. Pre 3.6 that will mean no guaranteed order. Glancing at the urllib3 source code suggests that the people who wrote it didn't care about order: https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/blob/master/src/urllib3/request.py
wrong kind of network
The \`break\` terminates the for loop, so it terminates the generator
There doesn't need to be a line of code. It's handled by the language. I'm fuzzy on whether it's triggered by \`break\` or by the generator being garbage collected, but either way, \`close()\` is automatically called on the generator object, raising a GeneratorExit exception inside of the generator, which causes it to end, and triggering the \`finally\`.
Just to make sure we're on the same page. I don't see you mention the array module or the number 10% in the end of the article. By array module, I meant this: https://docs.python.org/2/library/array.html
same. then ill turn to Automate The Boring Stuff with Python. 
That's actually wrong. Stopping the `for` loop just stops calling `next`. This is fully legit: ``` iterable = f1() for i in iterable: if i == 5: break for i in iterable: pass ``` As I've updated in OP, please don't assume that I don't understand how generators work. The reason the generator is terminated is because it's out of scope.
Useful information, thanks. It says it's triggered by garbage collection.
May I ask what part of IT you're a part of? Are you on the Devops side or more on the corporate?
Working through "Automate..." presently and it is great! 
Thanks for the reply, I'll take a look
BS4 and LXML are parsing libraries. I would start with BS4. It's easier to work with (IMO). You can configure BS4 to use LXML as well. Mechanize is used for interacting with web sites. I don't think it's Python 3 compatible though, so check out https://github.com/MechanicalSoup/MechanicalSoup instead.
Real soon. Look at Drone Racer League and DeepRacer League.
Who's a good boy?
&gt; Code is very simple, no concurrency Gotchas. Other than that whole GIL thing that we're talking about, yeah. Spinning up a new python process for each additional task works- I've done it plenty, I understand. It's still a shitty story and other languages do it better. &gt; I have no problem maxing out 128 core servers with Python. The goal isn't utilization, it's performance. The same program written in Go is going to be both cleaner and vastly more efficient, because Go has a great concurrency story with builtins for handling this stuff well.
This is not the intended purpose of requirements.txt. Document the external dependency and ensure your code properly handles it not being available and reports an appropriate error to the user.
Al Sweigart's earlier books helped me get started with Python many years ago. "Automate the Boring Stuff" is a great addition
Cool.. I've never seen the Python Networking book. I have Violent Python though... not so good in my opinion.
What parts do you find bash and PS to be superior to python?
If you're comparing tuples of varying lengths like that I don't know how you could possibly not be in a really bad place.
They're cracking jokes. IP networking vs human networking.

Do you care to share any of your tools or ideas you've pieced together?
I guess you ask this because you do not know they can (usually) work together.
Unfortunately there isn't really a way to do this. Weirdly nobody seems interested in solving it either.
You can use pycharm, it is better for python (in my opinion), you can opt out of sending any usage statistics, it is cheaper and it is not made by a giant monopolistic corporation.
what do you use daily?
Sure, that's very minimalistic though. I'm sure there are linters for vi that would be pretty valuable, for example
[No Starch Press](https://nostarch.com/catalog/python) has a variety of books offering lots of exciting topics, which you can use to exercise and develop fun projects. Recently, I've been working through "Python Crash Course" by Eric Matthes. When I started programming, I wish I had that. I picked up some of them in a Humble Bundle sale for 15 quid. It isn't free but totally worth it, imho. Other then that, [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/news) is a nifty module for developing games. There is a vast amount of examples including the source code available through their site.
I tried with both. Ended up with Python Crash Course
Well I'm sure I can pipe different scripts to one another. Are you meaning something else?
Loop through with a for loop. For each letter, see if it is in the dictionary. If it is, add 1, if not, create it in the dictionary with starting value of one. That should get you started. 
Would it be appropriate to have python run an init script that checks the users operating system type (and package manager if that is even possible) and does the necessary installation? I’m sure others have had to handle this issue themselves?

It's really good and you can do it in whatever order it's all separate after the first chapter. It includes analogies it's hands down my favorite python book for learning right now. 
any time you need to count occurrences, try a defaultdict &amp;#x200B; `from collections import defaultdict` `s = 'abc'` `d = defaultdict(int)` `for c in s:` `d[c] += 1`
&gt;Would it be appropriate to have python run an init script that checks the users operating system type (and package manager if that is even possible) and does the necessary installation? No. It's extremely bad manners for a python library to mess with a system package manager. The extent of any checks should be to try and detect the package and raise a clear, meaningful error message if it isn't there. &gt;I’m sure others have had to handle this issue themselves? Yeah, I tried to create a package to handle this type of problem in a generic way: https://github.com/unixpackage/unixpackage However, it turned out that it's not a totally task, it required a fair bit more work than I'd envisioned and the ongoing maintenance headache would have been quite high. Surprisingly it attracted a fair bit of interest, but it's still not a problem that really interests me. I'd love for somebody to take it over though.
In my personal case, I work a lot with VMWare products and I find powershell much better than Python, specially for scripting as I can get all hosts from a datacenter and get them shown in a neat table directly on screen and stuff like that.
I’ll save this for later. I need those books. Thanks for sharing.-
You may use Ansible, Chef, Puppet or similar tool for that and ship its project files inside your project's git repository.

How good is that networking book? I’ve heard pretty bad things about Packt books.

You could try "Black Hat Python: Python Programming for Hackers and Pentesters". It actually focuses on Kali Linux.
Hi, you've reached 911.
I picked that book up right around 2013 and still reference it today when people ask me about python. I’m not pro at it - but it was interesting enough of a read that I finished the whole book for concepts. 
I just got the "Automate the boring Stuff with Python" and I am excited to use it, but dont know where to even start with incorporating python- What would you say was the most helpful aspect of OpenPyXL?
If you are using sockets, you need to use a non-blocking `select`. If you google for "non-blocking IO with select in Python" you will find what you need. Please ask future questions in /r/learnpython which is the main subreddit for questions.
Thank you. And will post on there now.

Violent Python? Jeez I just want to learn to code.
I just bought the leftmost book from a unj bkstore. Cant wait to solve fermi' paradox :D 
All the code is wide open for you to look at. Regardless if the code is well known or a fishy, undocumented piece of junk. 
What exactly would that look like?
For comparing tuples of varying lengths I agree that tuple ordering is probably a bit confusing to use. But when comparing tuple literals of equal length, I find it's usually pretty obvious what's going on, sometimes more so than the more explicit approach (long `if` statements may be explicit but they're sometimes hard to untangle at a glance).
&gt; When I do, I will *at least* scan through the code. [added emphasis] I'm aware of the notion that all code is open to look at. However, that is not a 'technical solution' so much as a mere statement of fact. 
Thanks for the information. Do you know how this issue gets handles for a user end application? I would like to use pyinstaller or py2exe to make an executable. Obviously in this case I would like to avoid asking my users to install any packages themselves.
How much were they 
 &gt;&gt;&gt; ("3", 3) &gt; (5, 5) ? &gt;&gt;&gt; (3, True) &lt; (3, False) ? I bias towards avoiding tuples except for braindead-simple stuff (like X/Y coordinates) for precisely this reason. I've seen variations of the above examples cause serious production bugs on several occasions and I don't mean the nice and easy "EXCEPTION: Do X to fix this" kind of production bug I mean the kind which takes *hours* to track down.
python is great for the more end-stages of the work flows: you have data (or can use `requests` etc to download it), now parse it, crunch it, de-mangle, present/graph etc. For my own uses: bash/PowerShell are a bit better on generating/collecting the data. For example on windows boxes at least, it is *far* easier to use PowerShell to build a report on "what/when/where has the EventLogs been saying on &lt;x&gt; message" export that to JSON/CSV and ingest that via python and do a simple graph/plot thing to say "oh, got 25 of them on friday, but zero on tuesday. Hrm..." Just that the flow from one to another is better in concert like that rather than forcing python the whole way, or powershell/bash the whole way.
I would recommend using the `threading` module. Essentially, you want to create a new thread for each connected user. This is because the `.recv()` method is blocking. This means that you have to wait for that function to receive data before continuing on to the next step in your program (listening for new clients or printing received data). I usually have a similar setup for my multi-client programs: import threading # Listens for new clients and then accepts the connection def client_listener(): conn, addr = server_socket.accept() # Once the client has been accepted, a new thread is created for them handle_client_thread = threading.Thread(target=handle_client, args=(conn, addr)) your code here... # This is the thread that is created for each new client. Here you can print data, or do whatever you need def handle_client(connection, address): while True: print(connection.recv(2048).decode('utf-8')) your code here... with socket.socket() as server_socket: client_listener_thread = threading.Thread(target=client_listener) If you need any help regarding this, send a reply!
Haven't read the book nor worked through the examples, but some generous soul uploaded the book to [GitHub and updated the examples](https://github.com/royalbhati/Violent-Python-Companion-Files) through Chapter 7 to Python 3 last October. &amp;#x200B; The repo may be hit with DCMA notice, so snag the py files while it lasts ;)
yes, lol
1) The default state for large (and especially old) code bases is being in a bad place. I've had to deal with a lot worse than this. 2) If you *do* have a bug that causes tuples of varying lengths the last thing you want is weird behavior that triggers furious users. What you really want is an exception.

Sadly there is no good alterantive for Rstudio in python. Spyder, jupyter, pycharm, rodeo all have memory issues which cause problems if you a low spec system. The best thing is use some text editor or similar.
I accept that we live in a world where we can't personally verify all code. There's millions of lines of code running on my devices that I haven't been able to audit, and I physically couldn't even if I had access to them because it's too complicated of a system. Likewise with code I create I just cannot verify the security of all of the millions of lines of code that go into the libraries and support systems that makes things work. We just have to accept that and do the best we can. 
I don't think you can do that... and what server "requires" the headers in order?
Yeah, I was debating between Pycharm and VS. Thanks for the heads up. 
Did you check the source of the python interpreter you installed?
Ah yeah, so if you don't want to use Anaconda, you need to get it off your path. The Anaconda bin directory (where `conda` and `python` and any other command line things (like `spyder`) are stored) is put on the path in front of the /usr/bin directory - which is probably where the `pip install spyder` command normally installs the `spyder` program launcher. So if you want to use `spyder` outside of Anaconda you'll have to deactivate Anaconda. You might need to do this before even running `pip install spyder` as if you have Anaconda activated, the `pip` you'll be running won't be the system `pip`, it'll be the Anaconda `pip`. One way to deactivate Anaconda is to remove the line in your `.bashrc` file where it adds itself to the path. It's probably at the end of the file - you can comment it out if you want to be able to undo it later. Then reload the terminal. On newer versions of `conda` you can do `conda deactivate` to temporarily deactivate it. Or remove a bigger chunk of text that it adds to the end of the .bashrc.
I am a beginner. I am working through a udemy course. I have a long way to go
New to Python. Looking into pandas, gspread and the Google APIs to run the auto creation, sharing and formatting of hundreds of Google Spreadsheets. Converting a site with Laravel backend to Django. 
Also an important note: you can use pycharm community edition for commercial purposes, while any code written in vs community edition remains property of Microsoft and cannot be used in commercial purposes
The header formatting is handled by the underlying urllib module. The only way I think you can send ordered headers is if you format the request yourself and send it directly using sockets or format it as a cURL request and call it using subprocess.run().

Has setuptools really changed enough to justify it’s what 42.0 last time I checked? Is that a major or minor change relative to say 30.0? It’s clearly an API change, but I really couldn’t tell you anything that’s changed going back as far as 11.0. My code still works with no modifications. I seem to keep upgrading pip from 10.0 to 18+ as well. Bumping major versions 4x/year doesn’t change my upgrade process. From locked requirements, upgrade the package dependencies and rerun the tests. If they pass, I’m good. If they don’t, fix it. Repeat once every 6 months or so. This includes pip, my python version, everything. Keep running a build of my min requirements build and my max supported requirements for each platform and python version. That’s 2 * nplatforms * npython_versions builds I have to run on the test machine. Semantic versioning is great if the major version rarely changes. Otherwise, it’s noise.

I used work as VBA (Excel, Access, Outlook, and Word) developer and transitioned to backend developer focus on Python automation and desktop application, hopefully I can provide some input. If your accounting department's spreadsheets integrate with a 3rd party system that provides API service, then using Python will probably be a better options. But if you are strictly automating process within Excel itself, then go with VBA, since VBA offers far better controls manipulate Excel itself. One of the biggest drawback with Python to automate Excel is that, you can run Python while Excel is opened, versus you can run VBA to directly interact with Excel spreadsheet. One
With an attitude like this you must be a nightmare to work with. 
I explicitly trust anaconda because a lot of people trust anaconda. &gt; If you downloaded a binary, how do you know that binary was built from the code you reviewed? This is why code signing and reproducible builds exist. I'm not sure what this weird nihilistic hostility is about...
I generally do that, but what I'm talking about here, and asking about are about mechanisms and process. I personally consider to be professional negligence to embed a piece of library in a client solution that would introduce a gaping vulnerability... The industry as a whole seems to be very keen on the whole devops culture of buildability and testability, but there isn't much concerted **systematic** effort to even attempt to understand the security landscape in the same way... Anyways, I'm about to delete this question. It's getting to the state that Stack overflow is better in quality than r/python, and that's saying something...
So why don't you explicitly trust pthon packages because lots of people trust them?
Yeah, that's where I approach it from as well. But even so, I tend to try and avoid non-core libraries and read through them if I have to use them...

Where does the control lag come from? Python and the wiimote hardware are quick enough to respond.
They either write or check it themselves, or they pay someone else to certifiy or review it, and they have liability insurance. Or sometimes they do nothing at all, someone tampers with a node package and makes it into the news.

Thank you this is exactly what I was looking for! Implemented it and it’s working a treat. 
I mean, if I ever saw this in real code it would be abstracted into a named tuple or object within an hour. From there I can run easy typechecks if needed and also figure out the code paths that hit this point, identify where the stringed 3 came from, and see how much is fucked up.
That seems like the code you would pass to your worst enemy!

Great work man! But U gotta get a new keyboard, r/mechanicalkeyboard or something 
Sure! The way I tend to learn things is by figuring out how to make something that is useful for me in real life scenarios. I could never get into exercises like "Restaurant Foobar needs a way to keep a menu with prices and taxes and ..." so from day one I tried to make things that were practical and saved me a lot of time. ATBS is a great book for any beginner that wants to start making stuff that could be of use. Automate all the things! Master Python Networking is geared toward IT professionals / devops. It's a great book for learning to automate things like configuring network devices. It goes a bit into Ansible territory and the concept of code as infrastructure. I would probably not recommend this book to someone who is not in that field.
Snagged! Thanks :)
Same. I've had it for several years and I still go back to it every once in a while, simply because I'm into infosec . It may not be the best book in terms of programming but it certainly has a lot of interesting concepts.
Is the link to his git not in the video description?
Since you are an experienced progrmamer., I would suggest that you could start building a small websever with a database. For database, SQL, couch, mongo or any one you like. Python is most likely to have a library for it. For the middleware, you could pick Django, or flask or my favourite for small projects, flask_restful. A simple UI in basic HTML or some fancy UI with JS could fulfill the UI requirements. But most importantly it would get you started with managing a python based websever. Hope this helps 
You should put the no ones upwards and the yes ones downwards, would make it way easier to compare between hours.
I would say that breaking APIs all the time in a library is usually a sign of bad planning. A problem with many python packages in this regard is that it isn't clear whats part of the public or private APIs. Btw, you can still use the https://semver.org/ kind of semantic versioning even everything changes often, just stay at 0 as the major version: Major version zero (0.y.z) is for initial development. Anything may change at any time. The public API should not be considered stable.
A dropcatch script to watch domains which are pending delete and register them as soon as they drop. 
I agree. Violent Python doesn't teach you how to code in beautiful and Pythonic ways. What the book has going for it is its' concepts and direct approach to solving real problems. It's geared toward penetration testers and infosec people. I might get downvoted for this but... I often find myself in situations where I just need to code a quick throwaway script that does its' thing, and it doesn't have to be pretty :) But I see where you're coming from, and I'd definitely like to see an updated version of the book.
Corporate, but we've got in-house devs so I'm usually the one setting up servers and infrastructure for them, so I guess that part of it is a bit devops'y.
Haha ok that flew miles over my head.
 What about itertools.permutations, isnt it what its made for? def is_anagram(first, second): if len(first) != len(second): return False wanted = tuple(first) for option in itertools.permutations(second, len(second)): if wanted == option: return True return False is_anagram('Child', 'Cdlih') True is_anagram('Child', 'Hello') False 
This seems horrifically slow unless I'm missing something about how this function works. Can you run this against 300 character strings for me and time it?
I can share some ideas. My work entails a lot of administration of several VMware vSphere environments. The GUI is so alarmingly sluggish, and as a command line warrior I can't stand to use it. The Powershell stuff wasn't very impressive either. So I got into VMware's python module called pyvmomi, and I coded a bunch of tools that enabled me to do a lot of the quick stuff directly from command line. Like listing all sorts of info regarding VMs, datastores, networks etc, and also simple tasks like powering VMs on/off, taking snapshots. That code evolved over the years and I now have a command line based tool for administering about 90% of the stuff I need to do in vSphere, and my colleagues use it too. Other simple ideas... I have setup a way to make vSphere passive checks into Nagios with pretty much anything I want to monitor. Our IP-allocation database was a mess (the subnets we used for servers and devices) as it was divided into two separate systems due to a company merger. I coded a tool for importing all of the data from both systems and set up a new db with a Flask frontend for maintining the new one. It's in production today, and the two old systems are decomissioned. I've got a bunch of scheduled scripts running on hosts that scans our networks, internally and externally, for various weaknesses or to detect changes since last run, and it will alert me. Some of it is nmap magic, and I keep the data in a db and so I can produce monthly reports for my team. Python is what is stitching it all together. I could probably go on, but there you go, some ideas :) &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
https://pastebin.com/BeaNyGWS 5.45 ns ± 0.0636 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100000000 loops each) Is this slow? I never really checked timing for stuff

Thanks Kanye, very cool! 
one way is get involved with a python project and close tickets, ansible maybe
here is a dirty little secret, most programming does not really require much in the way of deep expertise in CS. you get something and put it on the screen/browser or you get something from the screen/browser and put it in the DB/message queue etc. It is an internship you are not expected to know what you are doing 
Automating a data entry task at work and learning Python at the same time :) 
Python isn’t turning “5.34” into a float, you are — that’s precisely float() does. Additionally, using a try/except just to catch an exception you’re raising inside an if is very unusual style and will kill the performance of your code. Just print the message inside the if and completely drop the try/except/raise shenanigans.
If you post your solution in ordinary text, somebody might write it as python for you. As it is, it looks like you want someone else to do the whole assignment.
But it's a screenshot. Must resist

Do your own homework.
2.7 is end of life at the end of this year. Please take the time to use 3.x there are several options. 
yes. I am aware of 2.7 EOL. It is just a big old code that we are not planning to change anytime soon. Although we are considering upgrading that to 3.x
This is a question about your operating system, not really about Python. The answer will be drastically different if you are on Windows, OSX, Linux, …
Thank you 
`float(value_in)` isn't done in-place. `float()`returns a value. You need to store this value somewhere. When you do `if value_in &lt;= 0:`, `value_in` is still a string. Also /r/learnpython
`float` doesn’t operate in place, it returns a value. You need to point `value_in` at the new value before you can use it. value_in = float(value_in) The name doesn’t really make sense after that, so you may want to consider using a new name for `float`’s return value and comparing that to 0 instead. 
I do have tendency to overthink (as i found i tend to over-engineer a solution) &amp; trying to plan too far ahead, which in this case is to get the best chance for full time opportunity after internship. 
Great suggestion! Thanks! What's the best way to get started? Is there a particular IDE that works best for projects like this? A package in Anaconda maybe? Installed Django last night using the pip command, so that framework is in place.
Sure would be a good way to keep sharp and pick up some valuable experience. Thanks! I'll Google around for more info on "Ansible".
Pick your favourite one. Sublime, pycharm, emacs, vscode, whatever suits you. Most of them would have support for python. I use vim.

I am on a windows 10 machine. 
dont worry too much about that, you may hate the company 
Awesome! Share some of the code?
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/class-method-vs-static-method-python/ Use @classmethod or @staticmethod when defining the class. Then you call it like: Car.do_something() If you need access to Car properties use @classmethod since it accepts the class object as the first parameter. Otherwise @staticmethod works too.
I don't know how to support Windows 10 but Google led me [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45137395/how-do-i-upgrade-the-python-installation-in-windows-10). Good luck.
How do you expect to properly use the `drive` function? Calling a class creates an object that is an instance of the class. Calling the function concatenating it to the instantiation is not different than splitting it in an assignment and then calling the function -it is not more *anonymous*- but you don't get a reference to the instance.
In your case: @staticmethod def drive(): #do drive stuff Car.drive()
Broadly speaking you read the data from the file in your program, then pick the part you need, possibly discarding the rest. If you can show an example of your data file and what code you tried already then you are more likely to get a more specific answer .
This is a good point. So just make sure to think through whether the method needs an instance to function properly or not
i saw that. and i know 2x runs in parallel with 3x. thanks though
Security camera too awful
I'm having a heck of a time formatting this code block on my phone.
Thanks. This is helpful and definitely the right way to do it. However, I am reading someone else's code and they do not use the @classmethod or @staticmethod decorators. Could the above format lead to any unexpected bugs in the code?

My data file consists is a long list. It contains 3 variables, 2 of which I need to extract. The first bit of data is a species name for an animal which is fairly irrelevant. The second bit of data is the latitude of where the species is. The third bit of data is the longitude of where the species is. Each line contains these 3 bits of data but they are separated by a few spaces. I only require the long and latitude. I tried using an index to isolate each variable but I'm having a lot of trouble.
Maybe look into "regular expressions" in Python. I'm a beginner at Python too, but "regex" helped me manipulate texts a lot. Then you simply use for loops to extract each rows or so.
This sounds like it could be the answer, but how would I be able to differentiate between two different bits of data on the same line?

It seems to me that you should be able to uninstall Python from your Windows control panel and then install the new version that you download from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/). But no promises that it actually works out that simply…
I'm not sure. Someone more familiar with the internals would be better suited to answer than I would. Personally, I haven't run across any issues with static or class decorators in the 8 years I've been using python. That doesn't mean there aren't any gotchas though.
yeah. I'm concerned about anything that might break
This might actually be it. It is kept in these columns. So I'll give this a read. I really appreciate it.

Now all you need are a couple of machine guns and my dream of never dealing with Jehovah's Witnesses is finally a reality.

Sure, but I like Go the language less. If I have a piece of code I need to go fast - I will write it in Scala or Rust or something..
It's not encrypted. I did it before replying to your post.
Well, we have tensorflow and scikit-learn. Python is easy, so building complex libraries is comparatively easier. That allows for rapid development. Best is where the best libraries are unless you’re going to write your own. It’s a chicken and egg problem.

C/C++
Not pointers again! Those things scare me.
I see Qt mentioned, etc, and that you want to add more advanced features like Tabs. Have you considered writing it in [PySimpleGUI](http://www.PySimpleGUI.org)? Your screen in the video will be quite easy to code up using PySimpleGUI. Then you'll be able to run it using tkinter, Qt, Wx and even a web browser, just by changing the import statement. I would be more than happy to help recreate your window in PySimpleGUI. Will be maybe 60 or 70 lines of code?
Is there sole record per line? If it is you may get your data by traversing the lines and extracting them with \`long, lat = \[lo.strip(), la.strip() for lo, la in line.split()\[1:\]\]\`. 
Why / how is this [so much faster than flask](https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=test&amp;runid=a979de55-980d-4721-a46f-77298b3f3923&amp;hw=ph&amp;test=fortune&amp;l=zijzen-7)? (And how in the world does flask end up being slower than Django?) I'm suspecting it has to do with the asynch-ness of the Uvicore underpinning, but would love to hear someone with some more in-depth knowledge of both the frameworks and / or the testing methodology here to chime in. It looks like some of these benchmarks include database interactions. Very surprised to see such a spread of results even when interacting with database queries. Inlined self-reply: Aha. [The FastAPI test suite](https://github.com/TechEmpower/FrameworkBenchmarks/blob/master/frameworks/Python/fastapi/app.py) is using [asyncpg](https://github.com/MagicStack/asyncpg) and direct SQL to talk to postgres via `await` + `async`, so as to be as I/O efficient as possible. [The flask test](https://github.com/TechEmpower/FrameworkBenchmarks/blob/master/frameworks/Python/flask/app.py), ugh, is using SQLAlchemy ORM atop MySQL using what seems to be a non-async mysql client. Going through SQLAlchemy ORM is definitely not an apples+apples comparison against raw SQL. That said, I still expect FastAPI+asyncpg to be, well, faster. But pairing Flask with both MySQL, a non-async db driver, and then SQLAlchemy is definitely not just comparing Flask to FastAPI. *Sigh*. 
What's better?
This is cool, but I'd really love to see the way you arrived at these numbers: &gt;* **Fast to code**: Increase the speed to develop features by about 200% to 300% \*. &gt;* **Less bugs**: Reduce about 40% of human (developer) induced errors. \* These are really ambitious claims, and they honestly make me trust your project *less* when you provide them without any hard data or methodology to back them up. 
Yes there is a sole record per line. I'll try and use your code and see where it gets me, bare with.
lol. I realized I should have explained it after I posted. Two main things for my particular work flow: 1. It only takes up 1 tab. I normally have a couple of notebooks running when I'm working and it's annoying to have all these separate tabs 2. File system navigation, usage (copying, moving, etc.) File navigation on the old interface was unintuitive and difficult to use in general. Moving files required you to enter in the exact path instead of offering an actual interface, renaming required a dialog box, etc. It got to the point that I'd only use the file system to open notebooks, but if I wanted to copy or organize things, I'd have to go to the OS browser. Jupyter Lab's is much more "normal". It's more similar to what you'd find in VS Code or similar.
what is the status of plugins? can you use those written for notebooks, specifically vim_bindings? I would switch but need vim keybinds to work efficiently. 
Vim bindings work! I'm also a Vim user, so that was also a must (and one of the reasons I kept holding out). As for other plugins, idk. I pretty much only use the Vim keybindings.
Question not answered in 5 minutes poking through the FastAPI docs: support for flask-esque blueprints? Being able to structure a nontrivial app/api into submodules and whatnot being able to expose a blueprint instance to link into the main app makes flask sane.
I edited my comment, pleasecheck it now.
I'm not sure what you were trying to demonstrate with those bits of code. Both of those raise an exception in Python 3 and on Python 2 they have some very odd behavior. The alternative chained `if` statements would work exactly the same in both Python 2 and Python 3 though. Unraveling the code into `if`s doesn't change the behavior. Python 3 still has issues with short circuit evaluation not catching bugs: ```python &gt;&gt;&gt; (3, "3") &gt; (5, 5) False ``` But the alternative `if` statement won't catch that either. I agree that short circuit evaluation and Python 2's very odd opinions about `&gt;` and `&lt;` on different object types pose challenges, but those issues aren't tied to deep comparisons. 
Frameworks-wise, it does have a rich selection, better than almost anything else out there. As a bare language, it's outperformed in many tasks by Scala, Julia, and a few others, unless you start getting into C extensions.
Lol there are still the logcial languages that are far better than Python in terms of machine language. *cough* lisp dialects.
Yeah the marketing spin this has makes me stick to Flask all the more, it might shit glitter and fart rainbows but it feels too car-salesman-y of a pitch for me to want to invest much time in it to find out. "\* estimation based on tests on an internal development team, building production applications. " means exactly nothing since they're the INTERNAL development team, they SHOULD be getting better numbers with the product THEY wrote. Drop the spin, give us real world metrics.
Our teacher has given us a function to use which involves taking the string and breaking it into tabs the code is as follows: def: x(Str): Str = Str.rstrip() return Str.split ("\t") Perhaps I should have mentioned this in the beginning 
&gt; As a bare language, it's outperformed Well, the scope is **machine learning**. Are you saying Julia outperforms Python in Machine Learning?
I mean, internal metrics and testimonials are still interesting - people don't generally write their own frameworks because they want to - but the interesting part here isn't the flashy numbers, but how you arrived at them. 
I just tried to duplicate your window using PySimpleGUI and it took 34 lines of code, so I was a bit off in my estimate. It only took maybe 10 minutes to write the entire GUI. But, that doesn't include the Menu Bar at the top. Maybe another 6 lines for that? Here's a version of it running online on [repl.it](https://repl.it) so you can see it in action right away: [https://repl.it/@PySimpleGUI/Reddit-Construction-Calculatorpy](https://repl.it/@PySimpleGUI/Reddit-Construction-Calculatorpy) &amp;#x200B; If you take that same code and change the import from PySimpleGUIWeb to PySimpleGUI, and run it locally on your PC, then it will run the tkinter version. The tkinter version looks like this: [https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13696193/54365290-f42fbb00-4644-11e9-88a9-01aaedd8be5d.jpg](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13696193/54365290-f42fbb00-4644-11e9-88a9-01aaedd8be5d.jpg) &amp;#x200B;
Flask is based on WSGI, which is synchronous by default. It can't use \`asyncio\` (\`async\` and \`await\` stuff). But still, you can compare the plaintext and JSON serialization, that doesn't involve a DB. For example, in plaintext, FastAPI does 169,554 requests per second. Flask does 89,497. &amp;#x200B; FastAPI is based on Starlette (ASGI instead of WSGI), so, it can be run with Uvicorn. And Uvicorn uses \`uvloop\` underneath (the same ultra fast event loop that was used by Sanic, built by the same guys that created \`asyncpg\`). &amp;#x200B;
They are based on internal tests in an internal development team. Comparing similar feature sets, the development time and time spent debugging. &amp;#x200B; It's not that easy to talk about "hard data" when speaking about software features (for the same reasons it's not easy to predict feature development times for new business cases). &amp;#x200B; But I encourage you to do your own tests in your own business case. It takes between 5 to 20 minutes to test FastAPI. That's normally enough to like it or hate it.
Yeah... This is good. I'm working on a very similar project, and I will have to figure out how to merge.
Doesn't matter, machine learning is all about training on large data sets, this takes time anyway, and there is no preference for saving time on this task in the market anyway. Python gets the job done because it's the fastest language to iterate in, and this saves time in the long run. 
Yep: [https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/bigger-applications/](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/bigger-applications/) &amp;#x200B; A specific style/file structure is not enforced, but the tools and utilities are there. &amp;#x200B; There are also \[project generators\]([https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/project-generation/](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/project-generation/)) with a more opinionated way to structure your app (actually, with a full base for a new project/app, including DBs, Docker integration, a frontend, etc).
Common Lisp!
Yeah, and even the simple 'return json' tests are being done with async functions. I bet that this could ultimately hint Starlette through to FastAPI core to allow to batch up the I/O. Man, socket I/O-optimized python sure has come a long way since Twisted. From a user's perspective, this and Flask appear just about equally non-complex, but ultimately much more efficient.
Sorry dude, not a good answer. You can't claim "300% faster to build features" and then say "just try it and it will be". I'm in finance, and this is an extremely risk averse environment. Just trying things won't fly here, and even if it did, I'll probably arrive at a very different result simply due to my own inexperience with the tooling, at least initially. I understand that reasoning about delivery times is hard, but to me, this makes making claims like these equally hard, if not harder. If your framework really does let people work faster and you don't have time for a properly designed study, just talk to those people and write down their testimonials - "It took us a week to ship a feature that I estimate would have taken us a month in Flask" is a great compliment to your framework, and makes it look good without making the pitch look forced. 
hmmm where did you place a log statement?? There are two sets of data that come... dogstatsd sends the system data which is not encrypted. The rest of the data is definitely encrypted though... I'm looking at it now for SFTP monitoring. 
https://github.com/jwkvam/jupyterlab-vim
In performance I think yes, in quantity of libraries and resources in general no. Now some people is talking about moving to swift https://www.fast.ai/2019/01/10/swift-numerics/. I think in part because Tensorflow released their library for swift.
What if you run a jupyterhub instance? Can lab work with that?
No idea. I don't do anything computationally intensive enough to need JupyterHub
Your data is tab-delimited and you'll get a list consisting of name, long and lat value when you pass a line to that function.
Hehe, get it. &amp;#x200B; I just removed that part so it doesn't seem "car-salesman-y". Now, I encourage you to go and try it, don't trust me. Check it for yourself. &amp;#x200B; About the tests: &amp;#x200B; In a project that was developed with Flask, Marshmallow, Webargs, Flask-apispec, there were several urgent user stories/features to develop. We developed them while measuring the minutes they took to build, using the same (Flask) tools. &amp;#x200B; At the same time, we started creating a "version 2" of the same API. Then we developed some of the other user stories/features using FastAPI, and we measured the minutes they took to develop. &amp;#x200B; Later, when we found bugs, started testing, integrating the frontend, etc, we measured the time taken to debug those same new features (in Flask). And then the same for the FastAPI features. &amp;#x200B; In FastAPI them amount of code to achieve the same was reduced a lot, so, bugs were also reduced a lot.
No ML lib for Python is pure Python. They’re usually python bindings for very performant C/C++ implementations. 
So you're saying this isn't encrypted??? &amp;#x200B; 2019-03-14 10:56:46 EDT | INFO | dd.forwarder | forwarder(ddagent.py:150) | x��}�o�ƒ��B��b�CB��&amp;���L&amp;^&amp;3O�fw�HIK�BR&gt;������D�~����%5ɪ�������6�G�pq�]�%��$\��|�E8G|!!�\F��K�g��z(�d� #дI6W��HbhAK�_UQU��?/�y�%D�+~�LU�� ��E���w����V̢�(�ZM7_w���q׃������W��3]�E������vU��G���A��-}Q�E/���E�V�����[��z�_To����%��Eu���qG#�J��+&amp;��wgI��A���ѽ����!�ۗ%��ξ��E�?/*B~Q�ϋ��_T�C_���/*&gt;�/&amp;@ֽ}Q!#~Y1�� �˲�/*l�/*n�/*p�/#r�)=�;Y�Q&lt;Q�Op����}�z(.��u��y use Xe&gt;�I*��Um�eR�&amp;�B[����&lt;K-�.�\}T�o��x��Q��h�F�yJ�iq,~���͊�h�d�?��Ls}�O(�-��� ȟَ��U?T#c���.��\��l*M��շE�h�� �B��bD��-��C&lt;���0'�S0I����R������Ăd��(��s����IH��~�0?�U�ƏTa�ow@r��0x�r�H��le1�r�3����C�2�"9���[�,�ݺ��{�x�aG䒑KJ����}���k����� ���]RV{i�K���`AG����h�BJ����UՕ��T���~���?�(�U��j��K��0����nKR�Mg7�:l���J�5+Q�A�4U��a���+%v�U�n{��oJ����w�&lt;1�o����W�E[-͟� �.�&lt;�&lt;�� 8d�L �@���D0�,��L���9���! ���bo�� ZT00�4D�"��d��&lt;��/=��!Zf�&amp;��U�h�!AH�����dOZ�Z?kx�!��B�FX�B�`��B��G�4�I��q���J|�Q�N9�B�X���g�&lt;Z'���x��0&amp;�CJ��PD�Cڮd2���ܕ~��7U��ac�&amp;4�p3h9bH &amp;#x200B; That's copied right from my terminal
Machine learning is more discovery than develoment, and that is where having a REPL counts and Python, through Idle, IPython and then Jupyter has worked on this. It also needs good libraries and Python has a tradition of creating both native language libraries and being able to wrap other languages functions and libraries.
Get it, thanks for the feedback, check my answer in this same thread: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/b0zxa9/introducing\_fastapi/eiihz3m/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/b0zxa9/introducing_fastapi/eiihz3m/) &amp;#x200B; I just removed that part so it doesn't seem "car-salesman-y". &amp;#x200B; Yeah, I know my word won't (and shouldn't) be enough to decide to use it in production right away. But if it helps, \[Microsoft is using it for internal ML APIs\]([https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/26#issuecomment-463768795](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/26#issuecomment-463768795)).
Yep! That's exactly the idea. And FastAPI clearly took a lot of inspiration in Flask and several other tools.
Speaking _totally_ second hand, I've seen blog posts floating around where people have demoed *very* impressive ML stuff in Julia. I'll see if I can dig some up. I don't have much to substantiate that claim beyond that, though.
I'm not arguing that Python's a bad choice. I think it's definitely a market favourite these days. What I *am* saying is that the other comment isn't totally wrong.
Cool!

The way you're describing it, makes it sound like you didn't perform a blind experiment. The developers were already familiar with the code base when they started using _FastAPI_. Understanding the code base is already one hell of a massive leap in speeding up development time. If you wanted comparative results, two dev teams, the same product from scratch, two different libraries - go.
Some details about the project would be nice too. I can already tell this guy is going to pay you with “exposure”.
name = introName() ?
I should put that like this right ?: &gt;def introPet(): name = introName() #the rest of the function
Yep
Whoa. Thats a thing that happens now?
Yes
thing is when it runs introName the first time the user puts his name in. When it then runs introPet, it re-ask the exact same question as introName since name = introName
You have to keep in mind that those variables that you are using are local to the respective functions, which means that they are only accessible inside their functions. What you can do, since you have a fruitful function that returns a name, is to use it to assign to the other variable, now inside the pet function: Like this: (inside pet function, but before you use it) string name = introname() 
that works but i get the question 'write your name' twice now :(
Ah ! Use name as an argument for your introPet function. ``` def introPet(name): # the function ``` 
Yeah, good point. Although I built FastAPI myself, the others have only used it (not develop it), but still, we have worked with similar tools in the past, shared ideas, projects and experiences in the past (pre-FastAPI), so, it's indeed a biased experiment. &amp;#x200B; I built this to solve problems I had, with my current and previous teams. And I wanted to share it with everyone that could benefit from it. But sadly, I don't have the time to do a lot of more rigorous tests. Testing team performance differences with frameworks could be a product/company by itself, I can't dedicate myself to do it now. I would rather keep improving FastAPI, as I (and others) have the "intuition" that it helps. &amp;#x200B; The best would be to have people not familiar at all with FastAPI nor Flask (or at least not much Flask) and test it properly with them. &amp;#x200B; If you, or anyone else here, has the chance to do a very rigorous, properly done, controlled experiment, I would love to see those results. And also understand what else could be improved.
That is because you are calling the introName() twice.. Delete the first call and just keep the line i wrote
Then you can add a condition to check if name already holds value
Thanks, will definitely check this out! One question, I’m considering DS but I’m afraid that it’s too much math. Of course I do understand math to a certain degree, but I’m not a professor or really advanced. How important is math when it comes to DS or ML? Thanks
So you can ask introName first and then calling introPet with name as an argument.
So Flask is really slower than Django? Hmm, I was think of moving to Flask to speed things up.
Still producing an error : introPet() is missing 1 required positional argument: 'name' Keep in mind im learning python haha
there is an error in the readme, ypu state install scikit learn and then give the command for tensorflow
Not working, now I just don't have a text for asking for a name 
Awesome timing. Tasked right now with building out an API server at work. I'm digging on Python at the moment, but was leaning towards Node just for the speed/efficiency. Will throw something together and see if the claims hold :) 
A developer community built with Django: [https://able.bio](https://able.bio) Currently working on APIs and React components for a better blogging UI, to be like Dropbox Paper.
So what you are saying should look like this ? : &gt;def introName(): name = input("Write your name:") return name &gt;def introPet(): name = introName() pet = "" while pet != "1" and pet != "2" pet = input(f"Hey {name} please select a pet \n f"cat(1), dog(2).") return pet
Awesome! I would love to hear how it goes :)
Yup
Why should people use this instead of [Sanic](https://github.com/huge-success/sanic)?
that doesn't work though:(
I can't see it in your docs, does FastAPI support Starlette's class based endpoints?
my bad this works now i forgot something HAHA
You can do this in fewer steps: &amp;#x200B; **def LoadData(**file**):** print**("C:\\\\User\\Excel\\\\{}.xlsx"**.format**(**file**))** workbook = openpyxl.load\_workbook(path) 
I'm in Seattle, got hired on at 83k, January this year got raise to 120k
Yes it works ahaha Now for the final part you need to call the introPet function To do all the work you have settled 
if mods doing job
it doesn't work... it keeps popping 'write your name twice' if there's a way i can send you the actual code that'll help i think
Yes send private message 
It's a bit faster (as it's based on Starlette), but I think that's not the main advantage. &amp;#x200B; The main advantage over most of the other frameworks is that it uses standard Python types for everything, to do data validation, serialization, conversion, documentation. All automatically. And as you are using standard Python types, you get completion, type error checks, and all those features that code editors can provide. &amp;#x200B; It's based on standards, OpenAPI and JSON Schema. It has 2 interactive API documentations (Swagger UI and ReDoc), thanks to those standards. &amp;#x200B; It also has a powerful dependency injection system, that helps for many situations. &amp;#x200B; FastAPI learned a lot from many other great tools, to see a deeper comparison and what it learned from them, check: [https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/alternatives/](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/alternatives/)
ALRIGHT!!! FIgured it out: &gt;def introName(): name = input("Write your name:") return name &gt;def introPet(): name = introName() pet = "" while pet != "1" and pet != "2" pet = input(f"Hey {name} please select a pet \n f"cat(1), dog(2).") return pet introPet(name=introName())
K, Thx!
Show us your function call to introPet
No, not on a daily basis at least. Sometimes I take part in meetings with important customers when discussing changes to networks, or incidents, things like that. 
You can use most (or all) of the features of Starlette as FastAPI is just "Starlette on steroids", but the parts to do everything based on standard Python types in parameters, dependency injection, etc, are designed for normal functions. &amp;#x200B; If you have a specific use case that would benefit more from class based endpoints but still using the rest of FastAPI parts, I encourage you to create an issue/feature request, to have a clear scenario that could require it instead of normal functions.
got it to work now : &gt;def introName(): name = input("What is your name:") return name &gt;def introPet(name): pet = "" while pet != "1" and pet != "2" pet = input("Choose between cat(2) and dog(3) return pet introName() introPet(name = introName()) 
Is it possible to run background tasks using this? Couldn't find any documentation for it Like, have the API return a response immediately, while starting up a background task, similar to how Responder does it
I just had the same problem the other day. Several ways to fix it: - do you really need a function for introname? It's just 1 step, you could put it in the main program or inside the other function - making "name" an argument of the second function. This way you can say name = introname() and then call other_function(name) - this one I was told it's a bad practice, but it works: making name a global variable, so it can be reached by other functions
How?? Ahaah that should give you an error as the function doesn't accept those arguments introPet function doesn't have parameters so you should not be able to do that If that works seems to me it is magic ahah 
I meant introPet(name) my bad!!
Yep. Responder and FastAPI are both based on Starlette. It is not well documented yet, but you can use exactly the same as in Starlette, return a Starlette response with the background tasks in it: [https://www.starlette.io/background/](https://www.starlette.io/background/) Still, I plan on improving how to use it in FastAPI a bit, to get the `BackgroundTask`(s) as parameters and keep being able to return any `dict` or object. But for now, you can use the same as in Starlette.
Yeah, no kidding -- that's about the most surprising thing I see in that result graph. But we should read the actual Django test code -- Flask is being tested using SQLAlchemy ORM through to MySQL. Let's see if Django is being put through equivalent paces at least.
Awesome. We need more projects like this.
👍 I'm actually trying to learn python on my own in hopes to make a transitions into QA. My patience for people have worn very thin from the past few years 😔
Thanks. I'd throw in a sentence of commentary along the lines of 'This is FastAPI's equivalent to Flask's "Blueprint" concept.' for some good google love. Searching for 'fastapi blueprint' is what I'd do to locate / jump to that portion of the docs. Good project, good docs, btw!
Awesome! Good idea, I'll add a note to the docs to make it easier to find.
Hey, how do you manage your logs ? I did give a try and the answer from a job is like 'success' or 'failed'. But we use a lot log.warning / log.error which does not make the programm failed but we want to be contact when this happne. Before we were parsing jobs + sending emails. Does jenkins has this kind of features ? :D &amp;#x200B;
But that's just it, some packages break the API, but it's so minor 99.9% of people would never notice (e.g., setuptools &amp; pip). You still gotta test it. I get annoyed when people get mad about a bug in a new version because they've already put it into production. That was dumb.
The title initially gave the impression that design patterns should be avoided when using python. imho, After watching it, I believe the title should be like: implementing design patterns pythonically. Design patterns are just guidelines and someone learning it should focus on the intent of the design patterns as they could be represented differently on different programming languages. And I believe that on this video, the presenter used those intents to do things in a pythonic way. 
I mean, nothing's stopping you from testing it yourself. To say you wouldn't try some new framework just because it sounds like a sales pitch is a bit close minded for a software engineer. Do you also avoid all commercial software?
Great project!
This is awesome for a quick json endpoint set up
don't worry! its necessary just to understand things, once you are familiar with it, you wont need it really during your daily routine :)
thanks, a guy already corrected it :D &amp;#x200B;
Great! That's the idea, to work well for quick or small projects, but equally well for bigger APIs (or migrations of previous ones).
My use case is strictly preferential. Coming from Django and having played with Starlette with a PoC I really like having Class based endpoints to handle `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, etc and allowing to have common code between them all encapsulated in a single class. On the other hand, I ran through the quickstart on your site and loved having the docs available without having to think about it. Being able to document class based endpoints in a similar manner would merge both of my preferences :)
I saw that luigi has a module called " server " which is a rest api. [https://luigi.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/luigi.server.html](https://luigi.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/luigi.server.html) So i'll give a try to luigi too. If you have any further feedback about jenkins or apache airflow, i'll be very happy to hear about that
Thanks for the feedback, I'll have it in mind :)
name = introName() pet = introPet(name) 
Only those that market with unrealistic numbers "200% more efficient than other products" "5 times faster at sorting" "10 times better text documents" It's marketing spin aimed at non-technical users, which is fine if your audience IS non-technical users, this isn't, give us real numbers and how those numbers were reached.

Reduces bugs because type hinting? Hold my beer . . . .
Probably a java guy salty that their language is being ruthlessly excised everywhere people can pull it off. Python's a fine language and pretty much any developer can write in it. Makes it way easier to hire for than more niche languages that might be better at the ML portion and harder for everything else.
My mind was blown twice with that Singleton discussion. Thanks for sharing!!!
Go for it! Yeah, people... what a bunch of bastards!
Yeah that sums it up nicely :)
Take a look at [this](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/global-local-variables-python/) 
I’ve been learning tensorflow on my own and taking a class on visualizations. The class is mostly busy work, so I wanted to start playing with my own data. I downloaded a dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and I haven’t been able to read an .arff file using scipy with all the variable names and metadata. It is driving me nuts even though I know I could probably find a workaround. I’m sure it’s a bug because I can’t even load the test .arff file. Any advice on how to report it? I really like tensorflow though. I used to use the built in machine learning tools in MATLAB, and tensorflow models are far more customizable. 
Will check it out. Cheers!
Thats amazing. I need to attend a bootcamp already and transition. Granted they might not teach me much but idk useful to get people to see you
I've been working on a passion project in my spare time for about three years now to create a machine learning framework that operates on a distributed cluster, to analyze any kind of data with very little friction. Ideally, you could point this system to wherever your data is stored and the integration is seamless. It is designed to scale to any size, effectively limited only by the hardware you can throw at it. Realistically, there is a threshold where you would need to stand up multiple clusters, but I'm knee deep in development so I haven't had any time to calculate what that limit would be. It's about 85% complete, so I figure now is as good a time as any to start talking about it. It utilizes a full suite of open source systems: * Python 3.6.7 (Keras/Tensorflow) * Docker (all components/code/applications run on this) * Apache Kafka * Apache Zookeeper * Django * Nginx * Prometheus * Grafana * ELK stack (logstash, elasticsearch, kibana) * MongoDB * MySQL The meat of the heavy lifting (data analysis and machine learning code) runs on Python 3.6.7 using Docker containers. Currently trying to figure out how to configure Docker to ship all logs to my ELK stack, but having a bit of trouble since I've never worked with ELK deployment or administration and my Docker experience is entirely in 2019. Late to the game with Docker, but glad I bit the bullet and started using it!
Nope. Because it does data validation, serialization and documentation for you. Automatically, from the type hints. &amp;#x200B; If you don't have to write extra code for data validation, serialization and documentation yourself, and make sure to have them in sync (your actual API with the docs of your API, for example), that's a lot of "surface" of possible bugs that are eliminated. &amp;#x200B; The less code you write, the less bugs you create.
If you're in institutional finance then you're clearly not the target for emerging tech, budding open source and generally anything from the last decade 
Not quite as institutional as you think, but definitely not a place that's open to fancy new tech either. 
Is there a reason you aren't using pandas?
I have no idea what you're doing, but you're doing something wrong. Here's your decompressed (*not* decrypted) data: [ { "status": 3, "tags": [], "timestamp": 1552507371.053209, "check": "ntp.in_sync", "host_name": "server", "id": 1 }, { "status": 0, "tags": [ "check:ntp" ], "timestamp": 1552507371.053523, "check": "datadog.agent.check_status", "host_name": "server", "id": 2 }, { "status": 0, "tags": [ "instance:localhost-22" ], "timestamp": 1552507371.198511, "check": "ssh.can_connect", "host_name": "server", "message": "No errors occured", "id": 3 }, { "status": 0, "tags": [ "instance:localhost-22" ], "timestamp": 1552507371.514714, "check": "sftp.can_connect", "host_name": "server", "message": "No errors occured", "id": 4 }, { "status": 0, "tags": [ "check:ssh_check" ], "timestamp": 1552507371.62889, "check": "datadog.agent.check_status", "host_name": "server", "id": 5 }, { "status": 0, "tags": [ "check:disk" ], "timestamp": 1552507371.76341, "check": "datadog.agent.check_status", "host_name": "server", "id": 6 }, { "status": 0, "tags": [ "check:network" ], "timestamp": 1552507371.764832, "check": "datadog.agent.check_status", "host_name": "server", "id": 7 }, { "status": 0, "timestamp": 1552507371.76485, "host_name": "server", "id": 8, "check": "datadog.agent.up" } ]
Did you manage to run jupyter widgets on lab? tqdm_notebook does not work because of this. 
No idea. Like I said in another comment, I have a pretty minimal setup. Only thing I use that's not vanilla is vim keybindings.
hmmmm okay I'll keep trying... thank you for that... now I'm really curious hahaha
My company is testing out lab in jupyterhub. No idea the state though we still use traditional jupyterhub day to day.
Here is the description of HTTP 2 headers, per RFC 7540, section 4.3: &gt;Just as in HTTP/1, a header field in HTTP/2 is a name with one or more associated values. Which brings us to RFC 7230, section 3.2.2, where HTTP 1.1 headers are defined: &gt;The order in which header fields with differing field names are received is not significant. That is the standard today, whatever Akamai may say or want to be true. If a web service breaks because unrelated headers are not in a specific order, that service is broken, and the fix really needs to be made there. I get that this isn't always possible, but let's not blame requests for this. You mention that you've read the section in the docs about header ordering, but all you mention is that you use sessions already. That tells me you didn't really understand what the docs were telling you to do, especially since you complain that "there's no code there". Using sessions does not magically make the problem go away. From your posting style, it looks like you may not be a native English speaker. Did you see that the requests documentation has been translated into seven other languages? Perhaps one of those might be easier for you to understand. If you go to the main doc page, there's a section in the sidebar labeled "Translations" with a list. I looked for the bug reports you mention, but don't link. I found [this one](https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests/issues/3038), where they fixed the bug, which seems to contradict your statements about them refusing to fix the bug, can't fix it, etc. The other examples I could find involve folks not following the documentation you linked. Of course, I may have missed the bugs you describe, but since you don't actually link to any, there's no way for me to be sure. In an effort to be helpful, here's some code demonstrating what the documentation tells you to do if you need strict header ordering: import requests from collections import OrderedDict s = requests.Session() s.headers = OrderedDict([("header1", "value"), ("header2": "other-value")]) r = s.get("https://somesite.example.com/thing") # Need to change some of the headers for my next request. s.headers = OrderedDict([("header3": "something-else"), ("header4", "yet-another-thing")]) r = s.get("https://somesite.example.com/otherthing")
Awesome thanks! I was thinking mailgun for the email sending part.
Whenever I see a project that seems to be reinventing a wheel, I have to ask the following questions: - What libraries/frameworks did you try before you wrote your own one. - What parts did you do not like and why? - Why was it necessary to start from scratch? Was it not possible to fix/extend the existing solutions?
Check out /r/learnpython.
Thanks for this. I was a little confused as my cousin uses it professionally and didn't mention this as I am working on a paid project. 
I've always wanted to have the knowledge needed to create a framework. Can you give me a list of all things to study, to get to the level that I can create a framework similar to yours? It does not have to be a detailed list, it can be the name of the subjects, name of books, etc. &amp;#x200B; Also, I starred in your repository to "help."
I'm making a game in school where you roll dice to determine what you do. I decided to make it in pygame for unknown reasons, and now trying to make animations, music, sound effects, a fight system are an utter pain. Btw, can pygame play multiple sounds at once?
Is that output from your local server or from the logs? And did you start datadog as a service? I am unsure why I can't see that JSON.
This. 
\&gt; Flask, Marshmallow, Webargs, Flask-apispec I am using the same stack right now for a project - thank you for combining them! It was/is such a pain to deal with the boundaries of each. I have one question though - is there solid support for API testing? For example, \`json-schema\` requires additional configuration in order to achieve basic functionality in unit tests. I think this is another area that could use consolidation. Lastly, as someone who uses your docker images (if you're the same tiangolo), THANK YOU! I will definitely try this lib out for my next project!
It wasn’t originally, but i see now that it is
No one really expected you to do more testing lol.
Thank you for your service.
Did you program arduino with python? If so, do you have any tips? 
Yup. https://github.com/LevPasha/Instagram-API-python
Good question. I ask the same questions myself every time. And I avoided creating FastAPI for a long time. I tried a whole lot of tools. And FastAPI got inspiration from a lot of them. A more detailed explanation is here: https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/alternatives/
The documentation looks really good. I definitely want to start a project with this soon.
As an old guy I just want to say your generation rocks, keep up the great work!
You could make a homebrew formula for your project, and a distro package for whatever distro you use. 
In this case, you can start checking Starlette's code (the thing FastAPI and others are based on). The code base is beautiful and easy (ish) to understand. &amp;#x200B; Starlette was created by Tom Christie, the creator of Django-REST-Framework (probably the most popular API Python framework out there), so, Starlette inherited a lot of experience. [https://github.com/encode/starlette](https://github.com/encode/starlette) &amp;#x200B; And thanks for the star :D
!RemindMe 1 hour
That's great! &amp;#x200B; Those tools are great, and inspired a lot of this. I even created a full-stack project generator with them: [https://github.com/tiangolo/full-stack](https://github.com/tiangolo/full-stack) (there's an equivalent project generator for FastAPI at: [https://github.com/tiangolo/full-stack-fastapi-postgresql](https://github.com/tiangolo/full-stack-fastapi-postgresql)) &amp;#x200B; API testing is actually quite pleasant, thanks to Starlette. It's basically using \`requests\` (or it feels like that). It is not documented yet in FastAPI, but you can use the same tools as with/from Starlette: [https://www.starlette.io/testclient/](https://www.starlette.io/testclient/) &amp;#x200B; Yes, I'm the same guy from the Flask Docker images (and others). Thanks! You made me smile :D

Well it would be a desktop application program you click it open , give it a word list which it can look up in the dictionary and retrieve the required parts: meanings, etymology, example sentences etc. and then save the results in csv or other format.
Awesome! I try hard to make the docs good, fluid, and easy even for new comers to Python :)
I think milage varies for everyone in a boot camp. If one is a person that learns well by reading and mostly needs a clear path of what to learn, it's a good fit. Also it can't be overstated how important it is to network with people in the field from day one. Go to meetups and treat talking with people at those meetup like a job. I'm a bit introverted, and this was the hardest for me but payed dividends.
Why this over Aiohttp for instance? I don't really see a particularly compelling case, apart from the benchmarks. 
Switch to Flask if you don't need all the "batteries included" of Django.
This was actually a pretty cool move, kudos!
So you made 4 videos about this?! Are you some kind of spammer?
*Fewer bugs
do you have to into your instagram account for it to work?
you forgot to tell us that you cant use this on windows because uvicorn uses uvloop and uvloop does not have a windows implementation
You could make css tables and link it to SQL? JavaScript frontend and use php to query the database
Also it should be 'Fewer bugs'
Oops. Thanks.
You can use it on Windows. Uvicorn uses `uvloop` *when available*, it is not required. It would probably make more sense to deploy to production on Linux (or *nix). But of course, you can develop and use it on Windows.
LAMP stack, PHP with HTML5/CSS front end.
The benchmarks are probably the less important feature. &amp;#x200B; You use standard Python types \*once\*, and automatically you get data validation, serialization, and documentation. Have you ever struggled synchronizing API docs with code? Also, have you used interactive API docs? &amp;#x200B; And because you are using standard Python types, you get all the benefits form editors. Completion, documentation, type checks. &amp;#x200B; It also has a powerful dependency injection system. &amp;#x200B; Give it from 5 to 20 minutes, you'll know if you like it or hate it from the start.
Thanks!
Check the [https://github.com/Delgan/loguru](https://github.com/Delgan/loguru) Used it for a few projects and it looks really nice.
Seems cool, I'm not very expert in python (and web development in general), but I like to make small projects in my free time. I often rely on flask since is fast to get a working prototype. Next time I will try your framework, love the automatic documentation and type hints
The layout minimizes unusable whitespace. In addition to ipynb documents, Jupyter Lab supports in-browser text editor and interpreter console . The single browser tab means you get some reduction in browser overhead if you use multiple notebooks at once. (The in browser interface supports document tabs and split views) Because it runs in a single tab, you can make chrome open it as a chrome app, with no browser header. Jupyter Lab is intended to replace notebooks eventually, so switching early will give you a chance to identify and report which of your favorite tools need updating. There are some plugin that don’t work yet. (my impression is that this is the result of a better designed system for supporting plugins) 
Lol thx man
Ty
I'm not sure of others but I believe pycharm will ignore your button press for end ' " ) }. So you can ignore it's there, press the keys anyway and then hit enter.
Since this is just a school project we had to use the materials our programming teacher would buy / had and he had relays and Christmas lights, I wish we would have had MOSFETS life would be easier
Pydantic seems terrible, it's assuming types all over the place. It's making this python lib as bad as PHP. 
But those tables will be conected one each other? &amp;#x200B; Domains D1 (I select and a box is opened) D2 (I select and a box is opened) D3 (I select and a box is opened) D4 (I select and a box is opened) &amp;#x200B; Actions &amp;#x200B; D1 (I select and a box is opened) D2 (I select and a box is opened) D3 (I select and a box is opened) D4 (I select and a box is opened) &amp;#x200B; An image to explane. &amp;#x200B; [https://i.imgur.com/e0gfjAI.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/e0gfjAI.jpg) &amp;#x200B;
Awesome! I try hard to make the docs very easy to follow, even for non-experts, if you've been able to use Flask, FastAPI will be a piece of cake (or piece of Pi) ;)
Yeah. Set the layout with css, and control the interactions with JavaScript 
Yes But I don't like jupyterlab. It may have changed, but the shortcut key settings change and multiple pseudo-tabs within a single browser tab is resource inefficient. It also loses all of my pseudotabs when I restart the lab server. But, your experience may vary.
I'm sorry to hear that. Type hints are standard in Python 3.6 and above. Pydantic uses those same standard Python type hints to declare data types. So, apart from data serialization and validation, you get better editor support, as it knows the actual type of your data. E.g., it can give you completion, documentation, type error checks, etc. &amp;#x200B; But all that editor support is a "collateral" benefit, on top of automatic data validation, serialization and documentation. &amp;#x200B; The alternative, would be Marshmallow (which is a great library). But it uses its own classes and utils to declare data types. So, you have to learn Marshmallow fields, classes and methods. With Pydantic, if you already know the standard Python types (and type hints, which are part of Python) you already "know" Pydantic.
I love type hinting! I think Pydantic's auto corrosion is a really really bad idea though. The author like to happily close bugs that point this out: https://github.com/samuelcolvin/pydantic/issues/360
I use Sublime text 3, it completes end parenthesis for You, but if You type it yourself it would not add another.
You missed what in my view is the killer feature of Jupyter lab. You can create any ordinary text file and then connect it to a console and a kernel. This means you can run code directly from the text file by selecting the section and connecting it to the kernel (also works for a markdown code block). This means you can have a document with codes in different languages and you can test all of them by connecting them to different kernels. Those interested to learn more should check the documentation and some videos [here](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/documents_kernels.html#kernel-backed-documents).
Actually, in JSON (JavaScript), there's no difference between `int` and `float`, so, converting floats to ints when declared as ints isn't necessarily that a bad idea. But still, in Pydantic you can declare custom validators to enforce your specific requirements, and they can even go way beyond what standard Python type hints can specify. I guess that's something that depends on taste. But in the case of Python, as it's duck typed by default (e.g. `bool` inherits directly from `int`), it doesn't seem to me that crazy. `issubclass(bool, int)` is `True`... Again, that depends on taste. But you can override it all to customize it as much as you want with validation functions.
Pretty cool stuff!
Having already used your brilliant Docker images for Flask-uwsgi-nginx for quite some time at work, will you provide a FastAPI-asgi-nginx image for this? Project looks good, I'll try it out soon.
Most IDEs allow you to hit ALT + ENTER to go to the next line from the middle of the current line. Super useful for this exact reason. 
Why don't you change the configuration? https://ipython.org/ipython-doc/3/config/index.html
Yes it does. Juste have to append /lab to the hub url (if jupyterlab is installed within the jupyter instance launch by the hub). There is some config to do if you wanna the lab be the default interface for the users. 
That's great to hear! :) Yes! There's an equivalent, specifically made for FastAPI: https://github.com/tiangolo/uvicorn-gunicorn-fastapi-docker
That's a lifesaver!! 
awesome. 
gotta try this! Thanks!!
Will try.... Thank you! :) 
Actually do you mind if I get your help on that? I'll show you the code, poor excuse for the current docs, and then get your input?
Right, Javascript just has "Number" which is ... annoying. I think invisible data loss by default is a bad idea though. 
I'm rewriting dumpmon (it broke in october). Basically is scrapes pastebin in realtime to find potential data leaks and credentials being shared. [https://github.com/Critical-Start/pastebin\_scraper](https://github.com/Critical-Start/pastebin_scraper) &amp;#x200B;
Read it.
I can not understand very well just by looking at the code. OK, I can get into the source code, study and understand some things that are happening. But why are they being made? Why is that necessary? I wanted to have this base knowledge to create a small framework from scratch, but knowing all that is needed, what I can extend etc.
yes very . thats why I stick with vi screw eclipse, visual studio and all that bullshit. I'm a programmer, I write programs, not "marketing solutions". 
Oh yes I've found that recently and I'm absolutely thrilled about it I'm an absolute newbie to python but I'm gonna take some tutorials for just plain python but then I'm gonna get started next with enaml-native to make some android app versions of some games I like.
Sure, I can't promise much, but I'll try to take a look.
a view weeks ago I started an git hub projekt for comparing xml files. Unfortunatelly the only one who seems to be intressted in, seems to be myself. So I am stuck - I need further input for improvements. Libraries that does the same job better in performance, reporting or both. 
I understand. I guess Python itself comes with some of that. I can't say it's good or bad myself, but I can perfectly understand your opinion.
If you want to go deeper you can check Uvicorn's code. Or if you want to get very technical you can check the ASGI spec (maybe WSGI first). Yes, I've seen Vibora. I understand it's pretty fast, but is not tested in the same benchmarks. It doesn't use the ASGI "standard", so I guess it would probably be difficult to integrate with other parts in the ecosystem (e.g. mangum, for serverless). Apart from performance, I guess the key differentiator of FastAPI is the use of Python type hints, and the integration with standards (OpenAPI and JSON Schema).

Does this support gevent ?
I’ll keep this in mind for new projects in the future, I mostly use flask to create api’s at the moment, among other things. 
Importing the module should trigger imports and decorators to run so (at least with py.test and pytest-cov) they should be counted as covered.
What are your goals? We work with XML trees over RPC using the Python ElementTree XML API. Also, the Eclipse IDE has a nice XML editor. However, it seems that everything is moving to JSON, and Javascript is the way to process it. &amp;#x200B;
I have updated recently, my pseudo-tabs are restored when starting jupyterlab again (next day normally)
I'm a sucker for these kind of problems and figured the time has already passed if he hasn't figured it out, also I wanted a chance to use named tuples: &amp;#x200B; from collections import namedtuple import math point = namedtuple('Point', ['easting', 'northing']) def compute_bearing(point1, point2): delta_easting = (point2.easting - point1.easting ) delta_northing = (point2.northing - point1.northing) bearing = math.atan(delta_easting / delta_northing) if delta_northing &gt; 0: if delta_easting &lt; 0: bearing = bearing + 360 else: bearing = bearing + 180 return bearing points = {1:point(5726.918, 2543.142), 2:point(5921.196, 2570.974), 3:point(6002.127, 2371.441), 4:point(5691.231, 2785.167),5:point(5679.232, 2260.695), 6:point(5433.269,2392.814), 7:point(5971.189, 2823.201) } print([compute_bearing(points[1], points[point]) for point in points if point &gt; 1 ]) &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;
Wow, perfect you genius!! There is also another task for the same assignment if you fancy a go 😁
Have a look at [https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm/issues/394#issuecomment-384743637](https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm/issues/394#issuecomment-384743637).

If the performance boost in fastAPI comes from the fact that it's async, is it any faster than quart (flask-like async framework)?
As they say, probably not the best for games. Try kivy. 
Do Jupiter notebook extensions work on JL?
There is active development on micropython, just look at the github repo. And there will be a new hardware [https://forum.micropython.org/viewtopic.php?f=19&amp;t=6077](https://forum.micropython.org/viewtopic.php?f=19&amp;t=6077) for the pyboard. Witch looks great!
Do not check if expression == True, do just \`if expression:\`. Avoid writing lines you don't need (pass, continue, ...). Instead: if type in types.keys(): pass else: ... write: if type not in types.keys(): ...
I already use the tiangolo docker containers and noticed this project about a month ago- it really is blazing fast. I've used it on a machine learning inference pipeline where reducing latency was critical and was super happy with the results.
This looks real good! My one question is: is there an equivalent to Django admin in this project?
Ray Id: 69696969
Oh nah it's a pretty simple game that can be done with buttons and text boxes
Is there a way to integrate Jupyter Lab into the anaconda package?
You are right. I just briefly mentioned it since there were a number of things that I tried out without success: *Almost everything else that I did (from using c native types to fooling around with how I stored things) resulted in degrading the performance.* More specifically, I tried working on c float arrays instead of using lists in python, which slowed things down. Btw here's the code if you wanna play around. [https://github.com/farnasirim/max-flow-optimization](https://github.com/farnasirim/max-flow-optimization)
[https://github.com/farnasirim/max-flow-optimization](https://github.com/farnasirim/max-flow-optimization)
This is amazing. I know what my weekend will consist of :)
Turns out that the way I was running the tests caused some funky behavior with the way imports and decorators were being evaluated. Instead of invoking it in a click command, it just called it from the command line, which fixed my issue.
holy shit imagine trying to work with that guy in a professional setting.
The data comes from scraping posts made by the respective companies on stackshare.io and can be found at [Github](https://github.com/LeviBorodenko/StackData) Graph visualisation is done in Gephi 0.92 The graph is created by setting each tool to be one node and two nodes are joined by an edge if they are used simultaneously by a company - edge weight corresponds to how often tools are used together. Node size corresponds to the amount of companies using a tool. If two tool are often used together then they will be closer together in the visualisation.
I agree about Cython. What exactly do you think can be done with numpy in this scenario? I think without "matricizing" the algorithm itself, there's not much we can accomplish here with numpy as the slow part basically boils down to a few lines doing memory read/writes.
Great project! Awesome docs! BTW, you're missing the "Run it" section on this post. (not missing in the github readme)
Awesome. Feel free to pm me for python questions while doing it. I haven't used enaml-anything yet but want to, and am handy with python. 
This looks very interesting, thanks for sharing! Do you have any plans for Graphql support? 
I bet you'll run into some trouble since the entirety of the value of the product would owe to the OED's content, and the OED already has software products of its own.
I wish my highschool offered programming classes
Thanks for the advice! I'll get these changed. I did just notice that I had a couple of unused definitions left over so I'll get those removed. I agree that it needs some concise comments explaining each part of the definitions so I'll do that. Thanks :) 
Do you have an official Docker image? Also has this been tried and tested in a docker/kubernetes environment?
&gt;I did just notice that I had a couple of unused definitions left over so I'll get those removed. Use a linter before pushing it to master. Check pyflakes or similar tool.
Almost every IDE i’ve used will just move your cursor over one character when you close the bracket/parentheses/curlys/quotes yourself.
&gt;tqdm\_notebook does not work because of this. Reinvestigate. It works for me.
Thanks. That was not the case a few months ago. At least not without tweaks. 
You could go through Django docs and build that app from tutorial (or your own), later add some REST APIs with django rest framework. Maybe deploy your app to some server when its done(DigitalOcean, Heroku etc.. )? 
at what point do I need to even be concerned about performance in Flask? like how many hits per second? 
In a production environment you'd use something like gunicorn with gthread or gevent to define concurrency if you were using say Django3. Doesn't that negate benchmarks as it drastically improves performance for a framework that isn't async by default? Really asking because I always see benchmarks on API frameworks and I've always wondered. Looks great an going to try and check it out more tonight. I've been looking for an alternative for NoSQL APIs. Although I will admit I'm a bit of Django + DRF for SQL. Djangos testing and ORM with DRFs serializers and viewsets are seriously awesome.
This kinda cool 👍
Features to consider.... -Add some deep fry to this bad boy or maybe the motion swivel thingy? -Watermarking? -Make sure Robbie Rotten templates are a default And Remember, Modern Problems Require Modern Solutions...heheheh Pretty neat stuff — great jorb dude— Mista Approves
Development using this framework would take significantly longer since there is no plugin ecosystem like there is for Flask and Django. Still it's always an interesting project to create your own framework. I just wouldn't use this commercially.
Not knocking anyone, but why does there seem to be another one of these type of "fast and minimal web frameworks" about every 3 months on /r/python? &amp;#x200B; Flask, cherrypi, falcon, japronto, sanic, etc. I see new frameworks like this on a consistent basis, has no one solved this problem yet? I can't imagine requirements around what Flask provides changes drastically between projects since the whole point of it is to be super minimal.
Hello! Thanks for sharing! I wonder if someone is up to implement a version for [realworld app](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld). That would be great!
glad to see js at the centre
Makes me cry.
When you return immediately, how do you get the "real" response to the user? Do they have to request again for the result of the background task? What if you have multiple instances of the application?

The galaxy. 
What this taught me is,,; C++, c# and .net developers must hate git lol
I want to learn how to do this, my god!
Why redact the other lines? It’s incredibly unlikely anyone can help you with the information given. Post the whole program and the whole traceback. Then maybe someone can help. Also, your tone comes across as very entitled and aggressive for someone who is asking for help. Tone that down and maybe someone will want to help. 
If you are about to ask a "how do I do this in python" question, please try r/learnpython
You can look at tinydb library. Simple file base NOSQL database
Very cool! Would be awesome to see the changes over years.
how ?
Agree, but if all your code is sync (not async) you can user threads to avoid async. Personally I hate the async stuff that was added to python, so I always use threads when I need to do concurrent stuff....
I don't really get why programming languages and things built with those programming languages and things built with those things so on... are all bundled together on the same graph as "technologies". What am I supposed to interpret from this? If Rails is being used then obviously they are using Ruby, D3, node etc all use javascript, then you have servers, storage platforms so on. The heterogeneity in today's software means any product developed by most company will have a large number of components and when you consider their dependencies and the dependencies of their dependencies you can connect almost all components to each other.
Recent versions of Anaconda come with Lab installed. If yours doesn't have it yet, just run conda install jupyterlab
Super, super, ***super*** annoying. I hate this mis-feature with a burning passion.
Using only threads and sync code is limiting in terms of scale and functionality, and not ideal as far as developer experience goes. `asyncio` is not ideal either, but it has advantages over threads. * coroutine-based tasks are lighter, so they scale way more than threads * coroutine-based tasks can be cancelled. Threads, not so much, as far as I understand. At least not unless you have a framework that requires you to code in cancellation points(i.e. checkpoints where you stop doing work and check on some cancellation signal). Which is what async/await syntax does, basically. * async/await syntax allows concurrent code to be structured and more easily understandable. You know better what's happening, i.e. when a task switch occurs. Simple usage of threads in a fork/join model(e.g. `concurrent.futures`) can be fine and simpler than writing async/await code, but it's limited and does not satisfy all situations. 
100% agree (although I use `emacs`). I don't have to learn a new tool every 6 months and I get tons more work done.

Ok thanks. I will try posting there.

That's a great idea! I'll ask stackshare.io for API access, so I can make such graphs for companies of different age (30+ years vs founded in last 5 etc. ) Cheers.

Imma take a guess: you're using Python 2. The solution is to switch to learning Python 3, but if that's flat-out not feasible, use `raw_input()` instead of `input()`
Amazing! Email me justin at StackShare.io
Am I blind? I see Ubuntu but can't see RHEL or CentOS...
Hello! I'm a bot! I see someone has already suggested going to r/learnpython, a sub geared towards questions and learning more about python. I highly recommend posting your question there.

What version of python are you running? You can check this why python —version. If it is python 2 than you may need to replace input() with raw_input().
/r/learnpython read the sidebar and format your code for reddit post ALL THE CODE post the error messages. ffs. get rid of the line numbers
Well, yeah. The vectorizing is the hard part. Scientific computing is its own specialty for a reason.
Can I have any info to call you bc it still isn't working. It now says list index out of range but not sure how to fix this issue and this project is due tomorrow. 
Or like your twitter/Instagram?
Nice

Or SQLite if you prefer to write SQL
Are you working on an interactive version? I’d love to be able to click and see the links and nodes more clearly. 
No Asterisk. Cool.
I’m guessing it is because values does not have four elements. Remember that values[0] is the first element, not values[1], also r/learnpython might be a better place for these types of questions.
